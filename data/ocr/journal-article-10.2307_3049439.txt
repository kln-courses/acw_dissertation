Ruth Tringham, New York, Praeger, 1972. Pp. 219; 53 pls., 43 figs., 3 maps. $12.50 Soviet Central Asia, especially southern Turkmenia, has played an important intermediary role in the cultural and technological developments of, on, and around the Iranian plateau - from Mesopotamia to the Indus Valley - since prehistoric times. Unfortunately, the wealth of archaeological and artistic informa- tion that has been diligently amassed by Soviet archaeologists since the turn of the century has been largely inaccessible to Western scholars. Within the past five years, however, two books have appeared in English that have made much of this fascinating information available for the first time to non-Russian readers. Gregoire Frumkin's Archaeology in Soviet Central Asia (Leiden, 1970) was the first of these; it presented regional summaries of archaeo- logical discoveries. Frumkin heavily emphasized art of the historical periods and wrote for a specialist audience. His book is especially useful for its detailed maps and extensive bibliography. The more recent book, under review here, is part of the Ancient Peoples and Places Series, which has for many years provided excellent summaries of recent discoveries from virtually every corner of the world for both the scholar and the less-specialized but engaged public. The publisher's inclusion of this work by two of the Soviet Union's leading archaeologists makes it one of the most welcome and important volumes in the series. The book presents a panoramic view of thousands of years of prehistoric development in the rich areas along the northern border of Iran. The book's value is enhanced by the superb photographic plates of recent discoveries and its detailed bibliography. We have Ruth Tringham to thank for the excellent translation from the Russian. It is easy to criticize volumes in series such as this because of their necessity to condense and compress, to eliminate detailed discussions of vital historical and cultural issues raised by the data, and to generalize to the point where the reader is often frustrated. These inherent limitations of a series are offset in this particular volume by the sheer importance of its making available to a wide audience the remarkably rich cultural development of this little- known region, a region that played such a key role in the early development not only of Soviet Central Asia but of the civilization centers of the Near East and South Asia. Only three technical factors mar the work's otherwise excellent publication. The trans- literation of toponymic and personal names is often at variance with usually-accepted Western spelling - for example, Tyureng- tepe for Tureng-tepe, Shakh-tepe for Shah-Tepe, Zkhob for Zhob, Kasal for Casal. Secondly, radiocarbon dates are cited without stating the half-life used or indicating whether the dates are the results of single tests or averages of a number of samples - con- siderations that are vital to the degree of reliability of cited dates. Thirdly, the maps are poor both in topographic and toponymic detail. The reader is advised to consult the maps in Frumkin's book. The vast amount of archaeological material is presented in chronological order by chapters. The overall picture that emerges is puzzling in some respects because both the material itself and the authors' interpretations of it stress a continuous technological and cultural development in the region from Paleolithic times virtually to the present. On the other hand, the authors continually emphasize the high degree of regionalism and the waves of external influences that enter and pass through Turkmenia, introducing new techniques, styles, and presumably other factors leading to increased social stratification. The picture is as tantaliz- ing as it is puzzling: it whets the reader's appetite for more informa- tion. On the Stone Age Period: Early Paleolithic remains in Turkmenia are described as resulting from external influence from both the Near East and the Caucasus and from the pebble-tool tradition of south and southeast Asia. Middle Paleolithic (Mousterian) remains are widespread in Turkmenia and well documented, especially in caves northeast of Tashkent. Upper Paleolithic remains are, on the other hand, rarely discovered and limited to stray surface finds. The earliest art of Central Asia is attributed to the Mesolithic period, dated by radiocarbon to approximately 7,500 B.c. Paint- ings in the Shakhta cave in the eastern Pamirs compose a hunting scene complete with "flying arrows." The rock shelter Zarant Kamar in southern Uzbekistan has another hunting scene with large, sweeping, horned animals, humans in peculiar dress, and "dogs." On the Neolithic Period: With the Djeitun period, dated to the 6th millennium B.C., we are in the period of "Incipient Civiliza- tion." Excavations at Djeitun have revealed a remarkable plan of a Neolithic mudbrick village. The interior walls of many of the dwellings were decorated with red and black paint, and even some of the floors were painted. The book presents drawings of representative pottery of the period and of animal and peculiar, highly abstract, humanoid figurines. The authors see strong connections with the overall Neolithic developments common throughout the Near East, especially in western Iran and northern Mesopotamia. The Djeitun stage in Turkmenia, however, is complex, marked by considerable regional variations. On the Early Chalcolithic Period: The first half of the 4th millen- nium B.c. brings us into the Early Chalcolithic Period where we witness an impressive growth in the number and size of human settlements and important developments in material culture and aesthetics. The basic archaeological sequence of this period was derived from the excavations at Anau by the Russians in the I88o's and by the American, R. Pumpelly, in 1904. This Anau-based sequence persisted until the end of World War II when it was supplanted by a sequence based on new excavations at Namazga- Tepe and other sites, which have provided a pre-Anau sequence as well. The Soviet archaeologists see the introduction of new tech- nological and cultural impetus coming from Iran and northern Mesopotamia, followed by a flowering of indigenous development within Turkmenia with the Namazag-I/Anau I period. Many of these early agricultural sites are large, covering as much as thirty- five acres. Twenty settlements are known in southern Turkmenia, which are classified regionally on stylistic grounds. With the Early Chalcolithic developments in agriculture and technology also came new developments in the arts. For example, at Anau was found a "shrine" with walls painted in rectangular panels with red and black designs. In addition, at Yassi-tepe, another "shrine" was discovered with polychrome wall paintings. These shrines are said to contain "the oldest frescoes ever found on the territory of the Soviet Union." About thirty percent of the pottery of this Early Chalcolithic period is painted, mostly with geometric designs but with some examples of goats and plants. Clay figurines consist of highly stylized, standing female forms and more naturalistic figurines of sheep and cattle. Farther to the east, in the Geoksyur Oasis, similar female figurines with no arms, breasts, or facial features are found (pl. 9). They have an exact parallel at the early site of Hajji Firuz in northwestern Iran. On the Middle Chalcolithic Period: Namazga HII Polychrome decorated pottery is common throughout the</page><page sequence="2">572 THE ART BULLETIN southern Turkmenian region now, but there is also a marked degree of regionalism in style. For example, at Kara-tepe there is a tradition of monochrome decorated pottery with stylized repre- sentations of horned animals, a ceramic type that continues into the next cultural period. In the Geoksyur Oasis, the contemporaneous culture is named "Yalangach." Some of the sites are fortified with mud-brick enclosure walls that have circular towers. Most spectacular among the small finds are the female figurines. More than one hundred have been found. They average between ten and twelve centi- meters in height, but one unique figurine, in a partially seated position, is twenty-eight centimeters high. It is a remarkable example of early modeling; with its emphasis on the breasts, hips, and thighs to the total exclusion of arms and facial details, it represents the supreme model for the basic type of female figurine that becomes ubiquitous throughout Turkmenia and, with minor stylistic variations, common as far east as the northern Indus Valley. The origin of this Namazga II period is a matter of considerable debate. Some see it coming from Baluchistan, others from south- western Iran, and others argue for an indigenous development. The authors offer no definitive solution. On the Late Chalcolithic Period Namazga III (3000-2500 B.C.) is a complex and crucial period. Agricultural communities made great cultural advances, improved irrigation systems, and refined the manufacturing and decorating of pottery; there is evidence of contacts with many regions of the Near East and western south Asia. Masson and Sarianidi stress repeatedly their theory that these developments were the results of extensive and intensive contacts with Iran and southern Mesopotamia, related basically to the expansion of the Jemdet Nasr culture. There are serious difficulties with this theory, some of which involve inexplicable anachronisms. For example, many of the Turkmenian ceramic and clay figurines, examples they cite to demonstrate this expansion, are not limited to parallels with the Jemdet Nasr period of Mesopotamia. Many are, in fact, typologically and stylistically much closer to Obeid-period materials of at least half a millenium earlier. In spite of the emphasis the authors put on the theory of massive infiltration of tribes, mainly from Iran, during this period, they also stress that the local line of evolution of the indigenous south Turkmenian tribes "was not overshadowed." The arguments become confused even more, however, when they draw parallels with the so-called Quetta Culture of central Pakistani Baluchistan and southern Afghanistan - parallels that, in fact, I find very convincing. The difficulty arises in the authors' insistence on a common origin for these apparently related materials from Turkmenia and Quetta in the "Buff Ware Culture" of southwestern Iran. Years ago most archaeologists working in Iran and Mesopotamia gave up this concept of a distinctive Buff Ware Culture in southern Iran, as well as the theory of Quetta contacts with southwestern Iran. This has been the subject of several lengthy studies published during the past decade, studies based on both the discovery of much new material in Iran and on more thorough reviews of the earlier published evidence. On the Namazga IVPeriod, 2500oo-20ooo00 B.C. Early Bronze Age This was a period of cultural unification over the entire southern Turkmenian region, characterized by "proto-urban" settlements with areas of sixty or more acres, the introduction of the potter's wheel, and the introduction of true copper smelting furnaces. It was earlier thought that the large settlements were surrounded by defensive walls, but this has been proved not to be the case. The ceramic industry is now much more unified and standardized throughout the entire region. Painted pottery continues, but it is now mainly decorated in monochrome geometric motifs. The earlier use of zoomorphic motifs has practically disappeared. There is also a new type of unpainted ceramic plus the introduction of gray wares. Female figurines display an important stylistic change during this period. The tradition of seated, armless, and faceless figurines continues from earlier periods, but incised decoration begins to replace the elaborate painting on the earlier figurines. Toward the end of this period, the fully-rounded three-dimensional figurines characteristic of the earlier periods become flattened and virtually two-dimensional. This flattened type of figurine becomes more fully elaborated in detail and more numerous in the following period. An interesting parallel to this change in basic representation of the female form has recently been dis- covered in northern Baluchistan and the northern Indus Valley of Pakistan at sites that are attributed to the Early Harappan stage of development. The south Asian examples seem, on current evidence, to be several centuries earlier than the Turkmenian examples, but the absolute chronologies of both regions are not really very secure. The interesting point is that we do find striking- ly similar parallels in figurines, painted pottery motifs, the geometric decorations on stamp seals, and certain architectural features between Turkmenia and the northern Indus Valley during this first half of the third millennium B.C. On the Namazga VPeriod This, dated by the Soviets to 2000-1600 B.C., is designated as the period of "Urban Civilization." This appears to be a misnomer recognized even by Masson and Sarianidi. Many of the attributes Near Eastern archaeologists use for defining "urban civilization" are present now in Turkmenia: monumental architecture at major centers (Namazga covered I70 acres, Altin-tepe I 14 acres); centralized production facilities with well-developed metallurgical techniques; evidence of class stratification both in the town plans and in the presence of collective burials; evidence of long-distance trade; and the presence of what appears to be an early stage of writing. But the authors stress that for unknown reasons the civilization never did become fully developed and that "culture decay" set in, with the result that the culture totally collapsed in the mid-second millennium B.C. One is tempted to suggest that there is something drastically inaccurate in the dating of this most important period in Turkmenia. The technological, artistic, and socio-economic stage described by the Soviet archaeo- logists is closely comparable to developments in both Mesopotamia and in the Indus Valley half a millennium or more earlier. Three recent studies, based on new archaeological data, on relative chronological synchronisms, and on radiocarbon dates, point to a mid- to late third-millennium B.C. date for this Namazga V period (C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky and M. Tosi in East and West, xxIuI, 1-2, I973; G. F. Dales in South Asian Archaeology, ed. N. Hammond, 1973; G. F. Dales Propylien Kunstgeschichte, xiii, 1974, ed. M. J. Mellink and J. Filip). Further study of this period is vital to our understanding of the entire development of urbanized societies in the Near East and south Asia. The collective burials found at Altin-tepe are indeed indicative of social stratification. One contains fourteen skeletons and a rather mundane collection of pottery and stone vessels, one clay figurine, some rings and beads, an arrow head, and two anthropomorphic bronze seals. On the other hand, there is a single burial at the same site, designated as the "Priestess's Grave," which contained a female skeleton "clutching two female figurines in her heavily ringed hands." Buried with her were one hundred beads of agate and lapis lazuli, and other stones, set in gold, and a silver stamp seal in the form of a three-headed beast of prey. The monumental architectural remains at Altin-tepe, "the earliest in the Soviet Union," reflect knowledge of southern Mesopotamia, according to the authors. The major structure was built in a stepped-form, which is said to be "an obvious imitation of the Mesopotamian ziggurats." On the Late Bronze Age This process of cultural decay culminates in the materials dated to the second half of the second millennium, the Namazga VI- Late Bronze period. The period is marked by the continued decline of the proto-urban centers and the return of even the agricultural oases to an earlier technological stage, characterized by the very beginnings of craft specialization. Masson and Sarianidi, puzzled by this, suggest that it is the result of massive tribal disturbances in Central Asia, the most significant of which relate to the migrations and diffusion of the Indo-Iranian-speaking peoples. On the Early Iron Age With the end of the second and the beginning of the first millennium B.C. we are in the Early Iron Age, which is again</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 573 characterized by a confusion of regionalized developments. The archaeological material is abundant but difficult to order. In the extreme west, near the southeastern shore of the Caspian Sea, is the Dakhistan culture with sites ranging in size from less than one acre to more than one hundred acres. Izat Kuli covers I25 acres with a pentagonal fortress in its center and a neighboring canal system that has been traced for some sixty kilometers. The pottery is mostly well-made, burnished, gray ware, which the authors compare typologically with the Hissar III-Tureng Tepe gray wares of northeastern Iran. But here again we are confronted by the Soviet archaeologists with a serious anachronism - a perplexing discrepancy between the foreign analogies suggested and the absolute dates assigned to the Turkmenian material. In Southeastern Turkmenia the later half of this period is best known from Yaz Tepe, Period I (960-650 B.c.). Large settle- ments with fortresses built on top of massive platforms are present. Iron makes its first appearance in this region whereas the pottery has returned to a handmade tradition. The authors point out that this Yaz I "culture" was very widespread, and they cite parallels of architecture and painted pottery with Period VI at Mundigak in southeastern Afghanistan. Currently I am also studying possible connections with recently excavated evidence at Nad-i Ali in Afghan Seistan. Farther to the east there are other regional developments of this early Iron Period. The Chust culture in the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan has unique features, such as semi-subterranean dwellings, burial evidence that suggests to the Soviets head-hunting and cannibalism and yet, at the same time, it has an advanced metal technology, using both bronze and iron. Fergana is regarded by the authors as the center of the ancient farming culture of west- central Asia. Of the same general period, the Ioth to 6th centuries B.C., are unique grave complexes in the delta of the Syr-Darya. Tagistken cemetery contains large cylindrical tombs, twenty-five meters in diameter, one of which contained one hundred bronze nails said originally to have held rugs against the walls. Although the tombs were plundered long ago, miscellaneous finds reflect the original richness of these tombs. Some of the pottery was decorated with gold hoops, jewellery was made of gold and bronze, and metal weapons were included with the burials. The authors suggest a close connection with the nomadic Saka (Scythian) tribes. In conclusion, the authors stress on the one hand an age-old infiltration of Turkmenia by tribes migrating from the Iranian Plateau, Mesopotamia, and from Central Asia, while on the other hand they correctly, I think, emphasize the necessity of detailing the evidence for internal, indigenous development. We are present- ed in this small volume with tantalizing fragments of information important not only to the history of Soviet Central Asia but to that of the Mesopotamian and the Indo-Iranian borderlands as well.
