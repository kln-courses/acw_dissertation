D., JR. Thyroid Neoplasia following Low-Dose Radiation in Childhood. Radiat. Res. 120, 516- 531(1989). The thyroid gland is highly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation. Pre- viously, we reported a significant increase of thyroid cancer and adenomas among 10,834 per- sons in Israel who received radiotherapy to the scalp for ringworm. These findings have now been extended with further follow-up and revised dosimetry. Overall, 98 thyroid tumors were identified among the exposed and 57 among 10,834 nonexposed matched population and 5392 sibling comparison subjects. An estimated thyroid dose of 9 cGy was linked to a fourfold (95% Cl = 2.3-7.9) increase of malignant tumors and a twofold (95% Cl = 1.3-3.0) increase of benign tumors. The dose-response relationship was consistent with linearity. Age was an important modifier of risk with those exposed under 5 years being significantly more prone to develop thyroid tumors than older children. The pattern of radiation risk over time could be described on the basis of a constant multiplication of the background rate, and an absolute risk model was not compatible with the observed data. Overall, the excess relative risk per cGy for thyroid cancer development after childhood exposure is estimated as 0.3, and the absolute excess risk as 13 per 106 PY-cGy. For benign tumors the estimated excess relative risk was 0.1 per cGy and the absolute risk was 15 per 106 PY-cGy. ? 1989 Academic Press, Inc. INTRODUCTION An association between X-ray exposure and thyroid cancer was suggested by Duffy and Fitzgerald as early as 1950 (1). Since then, a causal relationship between external exposure to ionizing radiation and thyroid tumors has been demonstrated in numer- ous studies for average doses ranging from 10 cGy to 6000 cGy (2-9). Internal expo- sure to radioactive iodine has been linked to increased risks following fallout exposure in the Marshall Islands (10), but not after lower dose fallout in southwestern Utah (11) or among patients given diagnostic doses of 31I (12). Although much is known about radiation-induced thyroid neoplasia, information regarding a number of issues of public and scientific interest is still limited. The thy- roid appears sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation, but the risk associated with low doses is not well described, nor are the shape and slope of the dose-response curve. Further, little is known about the pattern of risk over long periods of time after exposure, the appropriateness of relative versus absolute risk models to describe this 0033-7587/89 $3.00 516 Copyright ? 1989 by Academic Press, Inc.

Additional years of follow-up now allow us to address these issues in the latest survey of persons in Israel treated with radiation as children for ringworm of the scalp. This is one of the few human studies reporting a significant risk of cancers at doses on the order of 10 cGy, and thus contributes valuable information on the question of low-dose effects. MATERIAL AND METHODS Study Population The study population consists of 10,834 persons who received X-ray therapy for tinea capitis between 1948 and 1960; 10,834 nonirradiated population subjects; and 5392 nonirradiated siblings (Table I). All of the irradiated subjects were less than 16 years old at treatment. Study subjects either immigrated to Israel from Africa or Asia (mostly the Middle East) or were born in Israel to a father who had immigrated from Africa or Asia. For each irradiated subject, a nonirradiated, tinea-free subject matched on sex, age (?2 years), country of birth, and year of immigration to Israel (? 1 year) was chosen from the general population usingthe Central Population Registry. For 50% of the irradiated subjects, a nonirradiated, tinea-free sibling matched on age (?5 years), country of origin, and year of immigration (+ 1 year), with preference given to siblings of the same sex, was also selected. Tumor Ascertainment Thyroid cancers occurring between 1960 and 1986 were identified by computer linkage of the roster of 27,060 study subjects with the Israel Cancer Registry (Table I). All potential matches were individually validated. Hospital pathology records were searched to identify malignant neoplasms diagnosed between 1950 and 1960 (before the Cancer Registry was established) and benign neoplasms of the head, neck, and breast diagnosed between 1950 and 1980 (since benign tumors are not reported in the Cancer Registry). Because of the effort required to use pathology records for case ascertainment, it was necessary to limit the 517</page><page sequence="3">518 RON ET AL. follow-up for benign tumors to the period 1950-1980. Specially trained abstracters searched the pathology logs of each of the 22 hospitals with pathology departments in Israel. Names and identifying data for every patient with a biopsy diagnosis indicating a malignant neoplasm between 1950 and 1960 or a benign neoplasm of the head and neck area between 1950 and 1980 were recorded. Over two million pathology reports were reviewed, of which 59,000 either met the age and ethnic origin criteria of the study or had insufficient demographic or clinical data for the determination of eligibility. These records were abstracted, computerized, and linked to the study population. Finally, the entire roster of study subjects was linked to the Central Population Registry, which records the vital status of each Israeli citizen and permanent resi- dent. All but one subject were successfully matched and the date of death was abstracted for deceased study subjects. Cause of death was obtained from the Registry files. One thyroid tumor among the comparison subjects was identified through death certificates, as well as through the Cancer Registry. Tumors were classified as malignant, adenoma, or nodule based upon reviews of original slides for tu- mors diagnosed before 1974 (13), and review of pathology and/or operating reports for tumors diagnosed after 1974. The carcinomas and adenomas were classified according to the guidelines of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) (14). The carcinomas included: papillary carcinoma, NOS (ICD-O morphology code 8050/3), adenocarcinoma, NOS (8140/3), papillary adenocarcinoma (8260/3), follicular adenocarcinoma (8330/3), papillary and follicular adenocarcinoma (8340/3), and nonencapsu- lated sclerosing carcinoma (8350/3). Adenomas included: adenoma, NOS (8140/0), trabecular adenoma (8190/0), papillary adenoma (8260/0), Hurthle cell adenoma (8290/0), follicular adenoma (8330/0), mi- crofollicular adenoma (8333/0), and macrofollicular adenoma (8334/0). The nodule category included all colloid nodules and nodular goiters. Biopsies with the following diagnoses were excluded from the analysis because they were not considered neoplastic: toxic goiter; hyperthyroidism; hyperplastic goiter; hyperpla- sia; and cyst within the thyroid, but not of thyroid tissue. Because the classification of benign tumors is imprecise, we analyzed adenomas and nodules both separately and together. Dosimetry Patients received radiotherapy to five overlapping fields on the scalp, with lead shielding on the face and neck. Patients were treated at four centers, using superficial X-ray machines with beams of 70-100 kVp, 0.5 mm Al filter, and 1.0 mm Al half-value layer. All patients received a fractionated course of radiation therapy consisting of five treatment sessions over 5 days, totaling 375 R (9.7 X 10-2 C/kg-') exposure in air, and about 9% of the patients received two or more courses of treatment. The prescribed exposure ranged from 350 to 400 R (9.03 X 10-2 to 1.03 X 10-' C/kg-') depending upon the treatment center. Detailed reports of the treatment techniques and dosimetry have been published by Werner and colleagues (15, 16). New dosimetric studies were performed so that an average dose to the thyroid gland could be estimated for each individual subject. The prescribed exposure techniques used at the center where treatment oc- curred were incorporated into the dose computations, as was the child's age at time of treatment. The new calculations relied heavily on measurements made by Schulz and Albert (17) on an anthropomorphic phantom representative of a 6-year-old child. To take account of the size of the child, we modified the Schulz and Albert thyroid doses (17) using data published by Lee and Youmans (18). To adjust the dose for possible head movement during treatment, the individual dose estimates were multiplied by 1.5 as suggested by earlier dosimetry results (16). For children receiving one course of therapy the average dose to the thyroid was 8.4 cGy (range from 4.5 to 16.5 cGy), while the mean dose for all irradiated patients was 9.3 cGy (range 4.5 to 49.5 cGy). The dose was highly correlated with age at exposure. The average doses for children under 5, 5 to 10, and 10 to 15 years old were 12.9, 8.7, and 6.0 cGy, respectively. Younger children had higher doses because their thyroids were closer to the X-ray treatment fields and thus received more scatter radiation than older and taller children. Analysis In the analyses described below, the data for the different types of thyroid tumors (cancers, adenomas, nodules, and combined adenomas and nodules) were cross-classified by sex, ethnic origin (Israeli-born,</page><page sequence="4">THYROID TUMORS AFTER RADIATION African-born, Asian-born), age at exposure (0-4, 5-9, 10-15 years), time since exposure (0-4, 5-9, . .. 30-36 years), calendar time (1950-1954, 1955-1959, . . 1975-1980 and, for malignant tumors, 1980- 1986), thyroid dose (with cutpoints at 0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, 30), and number of courses of X-ray treatment (1, 2+). Computations for each cell of the cross-classification were made for person-years, tumor counts, person-year-weighted average values for dose, attained age, age at exposure, and time since exposure. There were a total of 2538 and 2436 cells with at least one person per cell, for the malignant and benign analyses, respectively. Person-years of observation were computed from the date of first treatment for tinea capitis, or the equivalent date for the matched comparison subjects, until the date of thyroid tumor diagnosis, date of death, or the study end of follow-up date (December 31, 1980 for benign tumors and December 31, 1986 for malignant tumors), whichever occurred first. Altogether, 821,430 person-years of observation were accrued with a mean follow-up time of 30.2 years per person for malignancies, and 663,180 person-years of observation with a mean follow-up time of 24.3 for benign tumors. Because radiation-induced thyroid neoplasia are not expected to occur within 5 years of exposure, the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded from these analyses, leaving 686,210 and 527,960 person-years of observation for malignant and benign tumors, respectively. Poisson regression methods were used to compute maximum likelihood estimates of both relative and absolute excess risks (19). Parameter estimates, likelihood-ratio tests, and likelihood-based confidence in- tervals (20) were computed using AMFIT, a program for the analysis of general rate models with grouped cohort data (21). Various factors which might affect the risk of thyroid neoplasia were considered for the models used in these analyses. These factors included: sex, attained age, age at exposure, time since exposure, calendar year, ethnic origin, and radiation dose. The relative risk analyses were generally based upon an additive model for the relative risk which can be written: X(Zo, fo)[l + (d, fd)E(Ze, Ae)], where the functions X(. ), 6( *), and ( . ) denote the background rates, the dose-response function, and effect- modification effects, respectively; Zo and Ze are vectors of covariates which may depend on time, and 0o, 3d, and Be are parameters to be estimated. Absolute risks were fit using an additive model of the form: X(zo, 0o) + b(d, fd)E(Ze, fe). The background rates and effect modification were modeled as log-linear functions, i.e., exp(fz). The dose- response function was modeled as either a linear or quadratic function of dose; however, in testing for an exposure effect, a binary indicator of exposure status (denoted by Id) was used in place of dose. The test for an exposure effect was a test of the null hypothesis Ho: f1 = 0 in a relative risk model with b(d, /d) = /IId The test for dose trend was based upon a test of the null hypothesis Ho: f2 = 0 in a model with b(d, fd) = IId + /2d. The test for a linear dose response was a test of the null hypothesis Ho: f = 0 in the model 6(d, /,) = Sld, while the test for nonlinearity was a test of the null hypothesis Ho: 12 = 0 and a dose- response model 6(d, fd) = PId + 2d2. RESULTS Biopsied thyroid tumors, including cancer, adenomas, and nodules, were diag- nosed in 98 irradiated subjects, 37 population comparisons, and 20 siblings 5 years after follow-up. Within the first 5 years of follow-up, one cancer occurred among the irradiated subjects and one nodule among the population comparisons. The level and pattern of the excess thyroid tumor incidence appear to depend on the type of tumor and a number of modifying factors which are discussed below. Dose Response A highly significant elevated risk of developing thyroid neoplasia following radia- tion exposure during childhood was demonstrated.

The excess risk was 1.2, 0.7, and 0.6 per 10,000 persons per year for cancer, adenomas, and nodules, respectively (Table II). As seen in Table III, the likelihood ratio test for an exposure effect was highly significant for each type of thyroid tumor. After allowance for the exposure effect, significant trends in dose were seen for cancer (p = 0.04) and nodules (p &lt; 0.001), but not for adenomas (p &gt; 0.05). However, when adenomas and nodules were treated as a single category, the trend reached significance (p = 0.01). There was a significant linear dose response for all tumor types. For cancer, adenomas, nodules, and total benign tumors, there was no evidence of nonlinearity in the dose response, when age at exposure was controlled for in the analysis. Table IV shows the adjusted and fitted relative risks for malignant and benign tu- mors by dose. It can be seen that the risks increased appreciably even within the small dose range. For malignancies, the adjusted relative risk increased from 3.3 at the lowest dose category (mean dose = 6.2 cGy) to 6.1 at the highest dose category (mean dose = 21.4 cGy), while the fitted relative risks rose from 3.0 to 8.0 for the same dose categories. For benign tumors, the dose-response curve was not as steep. However, the adjusted relative risks still increased from 1.1 to 4.5, while the fitted risk increased from 1.9 to 4.0. At 1 cGy, the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) under a linear dose- response model were 1.27 (1.15-1.42) for cancer, 1.08 for adenomas (1.07-1.10) and nodules (1.07-1.10), and also 1.08 (1.07-1.09) for total benign tumors.

Thus a large value for a statistic indicates a significant effect. For example, the tests under the dose response columns for malignant tumors indicate that there is evidence of a statistically significant linear dose response (versus a null hypothesis of no dose response), but no evidence of (quadratic) nonlinearities in the dose response (versus a null hypothesis of a linear dose response).

Thus all persons with 25 or more years of follow-up for benign tumors have been included in the 25-29 year category. excess risk. Since the results for the adenomas and nodules were essentially the same and because of the previously described difficulty in making differential diagnoses, adenomas and nodules were combined into one benign category for the subsequent analyses. Relative Risk Model Time since exposure. Allowing for a 5-year minimal latency, there was no signifi- cant change in the relative risk over the study follow-up period. Comparing exposed and nonexposed subjects, without taking dose into account, the standard errors of the adjusted relative risks are large and a test for trend over time was not statistically significant. This was true for both malignant and benign tumors (Table V). Including dose and other factors in the analysis for malignancies, a time-constant relative risk model in which the relative risks were allowed to vary with age at expo- sure and ethnicity fit the data well. For benign tumors, the relative risk was also con- stant over time since exposure with a significant decrease with increasing age at ex- posure. Ethnic origin. The relative risk for malignant tumors for persons born in Asia or North Africa was approximately three times that for those born in Israel. The 95% CI for the ratio of the relative risk for non-Israeli-born subjects to that of Israeli-born subjects was 1.0-20.0. For benign tumors, a similar pattern across ethnic groups was 523</page><page sequence="9">RON ET AL.

Sex. There was no statistically significant effect of sex on the relative risk. Point estimates of the sex effect were both large and inconsistent. For malignant tumors, the excess relative risk per cGy in females was approximately five times (95% CI = 0.86-oo) that of males, whereas for benign tumors the risk in females was about 0.6 (95% CI = 0.2-2.7) times that for males. Age at exposure. To describe the effects of age at exposure on risk, various models were examined: (a) a model in which the log excess relative risk was linear in age at exposure; (b) a model in which age at exposure was categorized as 0-4, 5-9, and 10- 15 years, and (c) a model in which age at exposure was categorized as &lt;5 and &gt;5 years. For malignant tumors the best-fitting model included ethnic origin and a single age-at-exposure indicator contrasting children irradiated before age 5 to those irradi- ated at or after age 5. At 10 cGy, children born in Asia or Africa, irradiated before age 5, were estimated to have a relative risk of 7.7 compared to a relative risk of 1.7 for Israeli-born children irradiated after age 5 (Table VI). For benign tumors, a log-linear decrease in the risk with increasing age at exposure fit the data best. With every 5-year increase of age at exposure, the risk was decreased by a factor of 0.24 (95% CI = 0.05-0.93). Regardless of ethnic origin, the risk at 10 cGy was 4.3, 2.1, and 1.3 for persons irradiated at age 3, 7, and 12, respectively (Table VI). Excess Risk Model Time since exposure. Using the absolute risk model, there was strong evidence for a continual increase in risk over the entire study period and against time-constant absolute risk models for both malignant (p = 0.006) and benign (p &lt; 0.001) tumors. For malignancies, the increase in risk was roughly linear (proportional to time since exposure to the 0.8 power, 95% CI = 0.2-1.6). A time-dependent excess risk model with allowance for dose effect modification (as described below) by ethnicity, sex, and age at exposure fit these data. Because the length of follow-up for benign tumors was 6 years less than for malig- nant tumors, the ability to assess the pattern of risk as a function of time since expo- 524</page><page sequence="10">THYROID TUMORS AFTER RADIATION Excess cases per 1,000,000 PY 8- Non-Israeli Born, &lt; 5 yrs 6- 4- ^^-^^'^ ~~~~~~~~~~~Non-Israeli born &gt; 5 yrs p2 -j___= Israeli-bomrn, &lt; 5 s ......---....._ __- - - - - *~""~~~~ Israeli-born, &gt; 5 yrs 0 ......... . ............i i i ...... ............................. ......................... 5 10 15 20 25 30 Years Since Exposure FIG. 2.

The excess risks in the 10- to 20-year period following exposure were estimated to be between 10 to 20% of those 20+ years after exposure. It proved impossible to fit simple models to the temporal trend in excess risk. Additional follow-up is necessary to clarify temporal patterns. Ethnic origin. For malignant tumors, as in the relative risk model, persons born in Asia or Africa had a threefold (95% CI = 1.09-17.8) higher risk than those born in Israel. Although there was no significant difference in risk with ethnic origin for be- nign tumors, the pattern of risk was similar to that for malignancies. Sex. When an absolute risk model was used, the risk of malignant tumors among irradiated males was estimated to be approximately one-tenth (95% CI = 0.0-0.4) that of irradiated females. This difference was highly significant. However, there was no significant difference in sex-specific risk for benign tumors. Age at exposure. As in the relative risk models, absolute risks for both malignant and benign tumors were inversely related to age at exposure. There was a smooth relationship for benign tumors, but for malignant tumors there appeared to be an abrupt change at age 5 years at exposure. Figure 2 shows the fitted excess risk of female thyroid cancers for selected ages at exposure by ethnic origin. Clinical Features The time from treatment to tumor diagnosis was similar for the three tumor types. The mean, minimum, and maximum number of years were 17.1, 4.3, and 33.8 for carcinomas; 17.9, 5.1, and 23.7 for adenomas; and 21.4, 5.7, and 29.3 for nodules. The larger maximum time from irradiation to cancer diagnosis reflects the 6 addi- 525</page><page sequence="11">RON ET AL. tional years of follow-up. The youngest patient to develop any type of thyroid tumor was 11 years and the oldest was 40 years. There was no significant difference in the distribution of diagnosis by tumor type, exposure category, or sex. The majority of thyroid cancers were of the papillary and mixed papillary and follicular type among both the irradiated (86%) and nonirradiated (62.5%) subjects. Follicular cancers also occurred among the irradiated (11.6%) and nonirradiated sub- jects (18.7%), as did one sclerosing cancer among the comparison subjects and one and two carcinomas not otherwise specified, among the irradiated and comparison subjects, respectively. There were no anaplastic or medullary tumors. One death due to thyroid cancer occurred among female siblings. The patient died at age 31, 2.5 years after a mixed tumor with multiple cervical and lung metastases was diagnosed. Seventy-five percent of the irradiated adenomas were of the follicular type com- pared to 83% among the comparisons subjects. Of the remaining adenomas, there was one papillary, one Hurthle cell, and four nonspecified among the irradiated sub- jects and one trabecular and two nonspecified among the comparison subjects. A familial clustering of thyroid cancer was found in two instances. A family of four sisters with thyroid disease was reported previously (2). This follow-up identified another family. A brother and sister were both diagnosed with follicular carcinoma. Their family immigrated to Israel from Libya and the thyroid cancers were diagnosed 19 and 25 years after irradiation treatment at ages 23 and 32, respectively. DISCUSSION Inferences about radiation effects on thyroid tumor incidence in this paper were based upon internal comparisons of exposed and nonexposed members of the study population. Parametric models were used for the background rates for both benign and malignant models. Over the current life span of this cohort, the logarithm of the background rates for malignant tumors increased linearly with the logarithm of attained age with a slope of about 1.2. The incidence of tumors in unexposed females was three times that in unexposed males. There was no evidence of significant differ- ences in the background rates by ethnic origin. For excised benign tumors, there was no good external source of information on background rates. Our efforts to model the background rates suggested that incidence increased with increasing attained age, but that the rate of increase diminishes with age. The age-specific incidence in males was about one-eighth of that seen in females, and among Israeli-born children the background rates were about one-third of those in African or Asian-born subjects. The particularly large sex difference in benign tumor incidence may be related to a difference in case ascertainment due to females having more surgery than males, al- though little is known about this potential source of bias. The results of the present analyses provided evidence of a linear dose response at low doses for both malignant and benign thyroid tumors. There was no indication of any significant departure from linearity for either malignant or benign tumors. Anal- yses by Prentice et al. (6) of the Japanese A-bomb survivor data also indicated a predominately linear relationship between gamma dose and thyroid cancer inci- dence. These findings are consistent with the Rochester thymus study (5) which re- 526</page><page sequence="12">THYROID TUMORS AFTER RADIATION ported that the dose-response curve was essentially linear, although a linear-qua- dratic curve could not be rejected entirely. Using either a relative or absolute risk model, there was no evidence of any decrease in excess risk for malignant or benign tumors over the current follow-up. These data do not support a constant absolute risk model for the radiation-induced excess for either type of thyroid tumor. After allowing for a 5-year minimal latent period there was no indication of significant changes in the relative risk with time since exposure or attained age. In general, for both benign and malignant tumors, the relative risk model fit these data at least as well, with fewer parameters, than did time-dependent models for the absolute risk. At present, we conclude that the constant relative risk with allowance for nontemporal effect modifiers is an acceptable model to describe the pattern over time for radiation-induced thyroid tumors. This is in contrast to the Rochester thymus study for which a constant absolute risk model appeared to fit their data reasonably well (5). For this follow-up, a new dosimetric evaluation was conducted so that individual organ doses could be estimated. These doses were estimated based on number of treatment courses, treatment factors for each of the four clinics, and age at irradiation, assuming that because younger children are smaller their thyroids received larger radiation doses. The mean thyroid dose for the entire irradiated cohort was estimated to be 9.3 cGy which is the same as the estimate obtained from the first study done in Israel (3, 16), but because of the allowance for head movement is slightly higher than those conducted elsewhere (17, 18). Doses ranged from 4.5 cGy for a person irradi- ated once at age 15 at the treatment center with the lowest doses to 50 cGy for a person irradiated three times at age 1 at the treatment center with the highest doses. Age at irradiation ranged from less than 1 year to 15 years, allowing a limited assessment of age-at-exposure effects. The risk per unit dose of radiogenic thyroid tumors was significantly higher among the younger children. Since they had the high- est exposure, a lower estimate of radiation risk would have been expected in the ab- sence of any modifying effect of age at exposure. Pottern et al. (9) reported persons under age 4 at time of irradiation for enlarged tonsils in Boston as being at the highest risk when compared to those treated between the ages of 4 and 6 or 7 and 18 years. These observations, taken in conjunction with those of other studies which also in- clude adults (5-7, 9), suggest that there may be three age periods with different levels of tumor induction sensitivity: young children (possibly less than age 5); older chil- dren and adolescents (approximately between 5-20 years); and adults (20+). Gender has also been shown to alter risk estimates. Greater thyroid cancer induc- tion has been demonstrated for females in many investigations (5, 22-24). In fact, most studies found the absolute excess risk per Gy to be about three times higher among women. The Rochester thymus study reported a higher radiation-induced risk of both malignant and benign tumors for females, using an absolute risk model (5). In contrast, using a relative risk model, the most recent study of children in Bos- ton irradiated for enlarged tonsils did not demonstrate a higher excess risk of thyroid neoplasia (they did not distinguish between cancer and benign tumors (9)). In the present study, our results varied depending on the type of tumor and statistical model. Using relative risk models, we found no statistically significant interaction between 527</page><page sequence="13">RON ET AL. gender and radiation, although for malignant tumors, as in the last follow-up (3), the point estimate of the risk was substantially higher for females than for males. Unexpectedly, the reverse was true for benign tumors, with males being at higher radiogenic risk. Using the best-fitting absolute risk model, a strong interaction be- tween radiation and gender was found for malignant tumors, with females having about a 10-fold higher risk than males, but for benign tumors, there was no significant sex effect. In the Rochester study of children irradiated for enlarged thymus glands (5) and the Chicago study of children irradiated for enlarged tonsils (7), there was some indi- cation that the risk was diminishing somewhat 25 years after irradiation, although there was still an elevated risk at the end of the study follow-up, about 40 years postir- radiation. At the end of our present follow-up, there is no indication of the risk de- creasing. Since our mean follow-up is 24 and 30 years for benign and malignant tumors, respectively, further follow-up of the study cohort will provide additional information on temporal patterns. Although there have been several prospective studies of radiation-induced thyroid cancer, few have included large numbers of people exposed to low doses. Shore et al. (5) report an absolute risk estimate of 3.5 per 106 PY-cGy for the Rochester thymus study in which the thyroid dose ranged from 5 to more than 1000 cGy (mean = 138 cGy). But, in an analysis restricted to patients exposed to doses under 30 cGy, with a mean of 10.5 cGy, the absolute risk estimate was 14 per 106 PY-cGy (23), which is very close to our estimate of 13 per 106 PY-cGy. Two other studies (New York tinea study and A-bomb survivors in Nagasaki) did not detect a carcinogenic effect at low doses (23). However, taking into account the small study population and the prepon- derance of males in the New York tinea study, the negative finding is not inconsistent, in a statistical sense, with the results from the Rochester thymus and Israel tinea studies. Given a mean thyroid dose of only 2.3 cGy, the small number of cancers, and the older age at exposure, the Nagasaki negative results are also not unex- pected. In fact, these data are compatible with risk estimates as high as 30 per 106 PY-cGy (23). The classification of benign thyroid tumors is problematic. For example, colloid nodules are generally considered nonneoplastic lesions and are not included in the ICD-O (14); nonetheless, several radiation studies combine them with adenomas as a benign tumor category, arguing that the distinction between the two is often difficult. Further, the International Classification of Diseases (25) excluded even thyroid ade- nomas from the benign neoplasm rubric and classified them as nontoxic nodular goiters. In previous papers (3, 13), we evaluated adenomas and goiters separately and found a significantly increased risk for adenomas, but barely any elevated risk for goiters. These analyses were based on small numbers. Our present study included a larger number of adenomas and a more defined group of colloid nodules or nodular goiters. We found that, although the risk of radiation-associated nodules was slightly lower than that for adenomas, both were significantly elevated, and the risk patterns were essentially the same. In a study of persons exposed to radiation for enlarged tonsils, Schneider et al. (7) did not distinguish among the types of benign tumors and referred to them all as 528</page><page sequence="14">THYROID TUMORS AFTER RADIATION benign nodules. In other radiation studies (10, 24, 26), similar terminology was used. In contrast, Shore et al. (5) reviewed pathology reports for three-fourths of the benign nodules occurring in a study of individuals irradiated for an enlarged thymus gland and reported that one-third of the lesions originally classified as adenomas were re- classified as nodular goiters. In an attempt to refine the analysis, the authors excluded the nodular goiters. In a study of hyperthyroid patients, Dobyns et al. (27) restricted their analysis to tumors described in pathology reports as adenomas, although they stated that some pathologists classify benign nodular lesions as involutionary nod- ules, colloid nodules, or just nodular goiter. On the other hand, our own histopathol- ogy study (13) found little misclassification between adenomas and goiters, and sepa- rate analyses were conducted. It is clear, then, that investigators use many different definitions for benign thyroid tumors, resulting in large differences in reported risk estimates. For example, in our present paper the absolute risk estimate was 6.5 and 8.3 excess cases per 106 PY-cGy for adenomas and nodules, respectively. The esti- mated average absolute excess risk per 106 PY-cGy for total benign nodules, however, would be 14.8, or approximately two times the individual estimates. It should also be noted that the distinction between adenomas and nodules is sub- ject to several possible misclassification errors. The majority of these tumors were classified based on pathology reports, some of which provided limited detail about histopathology. As noted above, pathologists use different terminology, and one may call a tumor a colloid nodule while another would describe it as an adenoma. In addition, some pathology reports were not specific about the number of nodules, and therefore it was sometimes difficult to determine which were solitary nodules and which were multinodular. Five out of the 29 (17%) irradiated subjects and 3 of the 24 (13%) comparison subjects were diagnosed with multinodular goiter. If these tu- mors are excluded from the analysis the relative risk of radiation-associated nodules decreases from 1.8 to 1.7 (95% CI = 1.0-3.1) and the absolute risk estimate becomes 6.4 excess cases per 106 PY-cGy. Although our classification of benign thyroid tumors was crude and some misclassification undoubtedly exists, we think that, wherever possible, separate analysis of adenomas and nodules should be conducted. To our knowledge, no other radiation study has presented data in this way. The Israel tinea study is unique in its method of ascertaining tumors. Malignant tumors were identified by computer linking the study cohort file to the National Can- cer Registry and validating each diagnosis by reviewing the pathology reports. At no time during this process was the radiation exposure status of the subject known. For benign tumors, the pathology records of each hospital in Israel were searched and all records of patients fitting the age criteria for the tinea capitis study were abstracted. This roster of potential study subjects was then computer linked to the study file. Again, exposure status was unknown. This method is advantageous for several rea- sons: there is nearly complete ascertainment; there is little chance of bias due to over ascertainment among the exposed; there is no recall bias as is often associated with questionnaire information; and there is confirmation of all diagnoses because all tu- mors were surgically removed. On the other hand, a retrospective estimate of individ- ual organ doses may be imprecise. Doses were calculated on the basis of treatment center characterizations and patient's age rather than on the basis of individual doses 529</page><page sequence="15">530 RON ET AL. and anthropomorphic measurements. If a child was considerably larger or smaller than the average for his/her age or if a child wiggled or the shielding moved, the estimated doses would be affected and could increase or decrease by as much as three times. In summary, our findings are compatible with the patterns of risk modification seen in most studies of radiation-induced tumors, although some differences were noted and the risks per unit dose appear to be higher. Of major interest is our finding that a linear dose-response curve fits the data best. This result is consistent with the data from other studies (5, 6). It must be stressed, however, that the relatively small number of excess thyroid tumors causes unstable risk estimates, and the population has been followed for only about 30 years after irradiation. Therefore, it is premature to use these risks for lifetime risk projections. RECEIVED: May 12, 1989; ACCEPTED: August 1, 1989 REFERENCES 1. B. J. DUFFY and P. J.
