<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume io, Number 2, April 1973 IV. THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND-BODY IDENTITY THEORIES FANNY L. EPSTEIN T^HE so called "Identity Theory of Mind and -* Body," the modern version of materialist theories of man, has been proposed and endorsed in the last 15 years by philosophers such as Herbert Feigl,1 J. J. C. Smart,2 U. T. Place,3 and Hilary Putnam.4 They consider mind or consciousness to be a brain state or process; in the "formal" mode of speech this amounts to asserting that mental and physical expressions, although having irreducible meanings of their own and being mutually un? translatable, do refer to the same physical reality. The reliance on scientific discoveries and devel? opments (especially neurophysiology and cyber? netics) and the use of refined analytical tools of philosophic inquiry have lent to the Identity Theory a great deal of power and credibility. Criticisms notwithstanding, it can be said that nowadays this is one of the most widely accepted views of the relation between the mental and the physical. But it seems that the numerous articles that assess the value or discuss the weaknesses of the Identity Theory have failed so far to pay attention to a crucial issue : the supposedly scientific character of the Theory. It is well known that the pro? ponents of the Identity Theory view themselves as champions of a "scientific philosophy" that strictly relies on scientific findings and methodology and is free of a priori preconceptions and bold specula? tion. Their theory has been taken to be a reason? able scientific hypothesis that is capable of con? firmation by future empirical discoveries. It is, therefore, interesting and challenging to examine this theory with a critical eye and to see the extent to which its scientifically-oriented pro? ponents remain faithful to the principles of the non metaphysical philosophy they preach. As will be shown in this article, a careful analysis of the Identity Theory reveals a great deal of dogmatic assumptions and uncritical statements, which are almost always accepted with touching naivete. To unveil the "Metaphysics" that hides behind the impressive scientific facade of the Identity Theory, three crucial issues will be discussed and critically examined: (I) the claim to Identity; (II) The interpretation of the mental as pheno? menal, subjective and private (and the corres? ponding interpretation of the physical as real, objective and public) ; (III) The misunderstanding of the "dualistic" position by Identity theorists. I. The Claim to Identity A clarification of the notion of Identity is per? haps the most important issue related to the Identity Theory and perhaps one of the most neglected by its very same proponents.5 It is important to bear in mind that all the sup? porters of the Identity of Mind and Body consider it to be a philosophical theory, not a scientific one ;6 this is a fact that tends to be forgotten, although it has been very clearly stated. Feigl, for example, believes that the issue between parallelism (a dualistic view that asserts a one-one or one-many correspondence between the mental and the physical) and monistic identity is philosophical in Ill 1 Herbert Feigl, "The 'Mental' and the 'Physical'," in^Herbert Feigl, Grover Maxwell, and Michael Scriven (eds.), Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, vol.

He contrasts it with the issue between parallelism, on the one hand, and interactionism, on the other, an issue which is capable of being decided on empirical or scientific grounds.7 According to Feigl, "the Identity Thesis is a matter of epistemological and semantic interpreta? tion, and does not differ in empirical consequences from a carefully formulated parallelism."8 . . . "There is no empirically testable difference between the identity and the parallelism doctrine. The step toward the identity view is a matter of philosophical interpretation."9 Feigl, as well as Smart, advocates an Identity Theory (as opposed to a correspondence theory) for the (philosophical) reason of simplicity or parsimony: it removes the two sets of correlated events and replaces them by two ways of knowing the same event, one direct, the other indirect. Put? nam agrees with them in asserting that whether sentences like "consciousness is a brain process" or "lightning is an electromagnetic discharge" refer to one and the same entity or to two is to be con? sidered a semantical or verbal issue which lies beyond the sphere of science proper. Before going further, it is important to give some thought to the radical distinction between "science' and "philosophy," or between "empirical" and "theoretical" (or "speculative"), as set forth by Identity Theorists. They all seem to believe that there is a sharp line of demarcation between "empirical" and "speculative;" in this respect they are faithful followers of Rudolf Carnap, who separates sharply between an observational lan? guage L0 and a Theoretical Language T0, con nected to each other by correspondence rules. L0 has a complete interpretation in itself; the meaning of an observational statement is fixed by the way the sentence is handled in the immediate observa? tional situation.10 On the other hand, a theoretical statement of science receives partial interpretation by means of the correspondence rules that connect it with observation statements; a metaphysical statement is one that lacks even this partial inter? pretation. This sharp demarcation between "empirical" and "theoretical" or "speculative" is an assumption shared by Feigl, Smart, and Putnam,11 and in dealing with their views I shall take it to be a justifiable claim. Nevertheless it should be kept in mind that the distinction between empirical and theoretical has been seriously challenged, among others, by P. Feyerabend12 and W. Sellars,13 both of them heirs to the philosophical tradition origin? ated with P. Duhem (who at the end of the 19th century advanced the theory that the factual state? ments of physics are not the result of pure observa? tion but of a theoretical interpretation of a given phenomenon.14 These philosophers assert that even empirical statements are theory-laden and that there is therefore no absolute empirical or observa? tional basis to knowledge ; the theory itself deter? mines what is to be considered as empirical evidence of it. This naturally blurs the distinction between scientific statements and philosophical or metaphysical statements since the empirical evi? dence which, according to the Carnapian approach, was to determine the scientific character of a state? ment is itself shaped by the theory and loses its independent status as confirmatory evidence for the theory.15 7 Interactionism entails a breach of strict physical2 determinism since mental events are endowed with a causal efficacy of their own and are not absolutely determined by inorganic physical processes. On the contrary, in the case of Parallelism, a strict physicala determinism does hold.

V. O.

Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism," in From a Logical Point of View (Cambridge, 1953).</page><page sequence="3">THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND-BODY IDENTITY THEORIES 113 But as we have already seen, Identity theorists seem to hold fast to the radical demarcation between science (supported by empirical evidence) and philosophy (which doesn't provide new empirical content to knowledge and deals only with a theoretical or semantical interpretation of scientific facts). The Identity Theory which postulates the same? ness of reference of mental and physical terms is, according to them, philosophical in character since it cannot be either confirmed or refuted by observa? tion and experiment. This means that the advance? ment of science is per se irrelevant to the truth or falsity of the Identity Theory. The identification of the mental and the physical seems to depend on a philosophical and speculative interpretation of psychophysical correspondence. The Identity Theory will assert not only that mental states are nomologically correlated with brain states (a person is in mental state M at time t if and only if it is in brain state B at time t) but that they are one and the same : the property of being in pain, for example, is identified with the property of being in brain state B. Since the only factual component of the Identity statement "consciousness is a brain process" is the correlation between mental states and brain processes (also called psychophysical correspondence) there is no additional empirical evidence that would establish the correctness of the Identity Theory? which is not a statement of facts, but a philosophical interpretation of scientific facts. This being established, let's turn to an examina? tion of the Identity statement itself. By "Identity" Feigl means that "one and the same individual may be designated by different labels or described in different ways."16 A good example is that of the "Evening Star" and the "Morning Star," two expressions with different meanings which refer to one and the same planet. In the Mind-Body case this amounts to asserting that the referent of mental and physical terms is the same, although their meanings are independent of each other and mutually untranslatable. According to Smart, the statement "conscious? ness is a brain process" is a case of strict identity: when I report a mental state I am really referring to a brain state. And for Place, the Mind-Body Identity statement is analogous to a statement like "lightning is a motion of electric charges," in that in both cases there is only one event or state of affairs that is referred to (i.e., a brain process and an electric discharge) although the meanings of the respective terms are independent of each other. In all these cases, it is obvious that Identity is interpreted as extensional or numerical and points to the unique referent of two different names or descriptions; it is not understood as an analytical Identity which implies synonymy of the terms involved. The Mind-Body Identity, then, is synthetic and "empirical," in the sense that it does not hold by virtue of the meaning of the terms (which are not synonymous), but depends on factual elements (the establishment of psychophysical correlations,17 for example) for its certification. In this respect the identification of the mental and the physical is analogous to theoretical identities of the physical sciences, like that of "temperature" with "kinetic energy" or "gas pressure" with "the sum of the moments delivered by the molecules of a gas to the walls of its container."18 The crucial question that arises in all these cases is whether we are here referring to one or two entities or events. As long as Identity is understood as implying the sameness of referent, the ascertainment of the identity statement must depend on factual in? formation (although in most cases it also involves highly theoretical assumptions) : that there was a man called "Shakespeare" and that he is the author of Hamlet is empirically determined. In the case of the "Morning Star" and the "Evening Star," it was discovered that there was only one planet referred to by the two expressions. Is there a similar way of determining the Identity of Mind and Body? We mentioned earlier that there is no empirical evidence that would warrant the identity of reference of "Mind" and "Body" (as opposed to a mere correlation of mental states and brain pro? cesses) ; we have to consider, therefore, the Identity statement as highly "metaphysical" (in the sense that scientifically-oriented philosophers give to this word). 16 Herbert Feigl, "The 'Mental' and the 'Physical'," op., cit., p. 439. 17 Herbert Feigl, ibid., p. 442 : "The neurophysiology of the future (3000 A.D.) should provide complete deductive derivations of the behavior symptoms of various central states whose ^-correlates are the familiar sensations, perceptions, thoughts, beliefs, desires volitions, emotions and sentiments (known by acquaintance and described in phenomenal language)." 18 Ibid., p. 441 abd p. 477.</page><page sequence="4">114 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY To support the Identity statement, its pro? ponents would have to provide additional argu? ments based either on ontological considerations (e.g., the basic entities of the world are those postu? lated by physical theory), linguistic assumptions (whereby it is stipulated that the word "conscious? ness" is synonymous with words denoting physical processes and is exclusively used to refer to such processes), or both.19 But Identity theorists seem unaware of the onto? logical premisses required to justify their claim on the identity of reference of mental and physical expressions. They are oblivious to the fact that the soundness of their theory depends either on the adoption of a metaphysical standpoint or on an arbitrary and unwarranted decision about the reference of linguistic expressions. This naturally carries us well beyond the realm of science and "testable hypotheses" (to use Place's terms) and weakens the main thrust of the Identity Theory as being based on scientific facts. As we mentioned earlier, the Mind-Body Iden? tity statement is analogous to other theoretical statements of science, e.g., "light is electromagnetic radiation" or "temperature is the mean kinetic energy of molecules." Whether or not we are here referring to one entity in two different ways is, as we saw, an open question, the answer to which involves more than just scientific discoveries or theorizing. In any case, one thing is clear: All the statements point to the fact that one event is being explained in terms of another : light is explained as electromagnetic radiation and mind as a brain process. In other words this means that a theory is being reduced to a more basic one. In the Mind-Body case it amounts to asserting that the laws of psychol? ogy might be ultimately reduced to the more basic laws of physics. And the crucial question that con? cerns us in our discussion of the Identity Theory is whether this reduction implies or entails the Identity of consciousness and brain process. If A is explained by means of B, does this mean that A is identical with B ? Let's examine the role of a statement like "temperature is kinetic energy" within the scientific framework. The reduction of thermodynamics to statistical mechanics is to be understood as imply? ing that the laws of the first can be logically derived from those of the latter. Since the descriptive con? cepts of thermodynamics do not appear in the formulation of statistical mechanics (which, being the reducing theory, is much simpler and compre? hensive than the reduced one), there is need, for the derivation to be acomplished, for a postulate or connecting principle relating the main descriptive concepts of thermodynamics (e.g., "temperature") to those of statistical mechanics (e.g., "kinetic energy"). This postulate, in which concepts of both theories occur, is expressed, in most cases, as an Identity statement ("temperature is kinetic energy" and operates as an auxiliary premiss of deriva? tion.20) In a similar way, the reduction of mentalistic psychology to neurophysiology requires a con? necting principle in which both mentalistic and physicalistic concepts occur in order for the deriva? tion to be possible. This principle would be stated as "Mind is a Brain process." Identity theorists argue for the Identity of refer? ence of the terms involved in this statement on the grounds of simplicity or parsimony (i.e., avoidance of the "nomological danglers" and psychophysical laws of correspondence theories). But is this indeed the case? Jaegwon Kim has convincingly argued21 that the theoretical reduction doesn't require (or sanction) an Identity statement and that a mere correlation statement can fulfill the same task without hamper? ing the simplicity of the theory: the number of primitive concepts remains the same whether we adopt an Identity statement or a correlation state? ment as connecting principle since the terms related by this principle are non synonymous; nor 19 The linguistic justification of reference is in itself problematic. J. W. Cornman has argued that questions of reference ("what '/&gt;' refers to"), when raised by philosophers, cannot be answered by appealing to formal rules of language or to ostensive pointing: the question is basically metaphysical, i.e., "external" to the linguistic framework itself, and demands ontological assumptions about the relation of language to reality. See James W. Cornman, Metaphysics, Reference and Language (New Haven, 1966), passim especially pp. 174-179. Cornman asserts that formal reference sentences and ostensive answers inform the non-philosopher of "how he is permitted by his language to talk about what there is, but, in one sense, they do not tell him what there is." "The philosopher ... is asking about what there is regardless of which language we use, and for this the kind of answers which satisfy the non-philosopher will not do." (Ibid., p. 179.) 20 On this see Ernest Nagel, The Structure of Science (New York, Harcourt, 1961), especially ch. 11. 21 Jaegwon Kim, "On the Psychophysical Identity Theory," American Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 2 (1966), pp. 227-235.</page><page sequence="5">THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND-BODY IDENTITY THEORIES II5 is the number of independent primitive assump? tions reduced.22 The same applies to the Mind-Body case. To derive the laws of psychology from those of physics it is only necessary to assert the correlation of mental events and physical events, not their identity. To say that consciousness is a brain process does not increase either the theoretical power or the factual implications of the theory, which means that the Identity statement cannot be justified even on the basis of methodological considerations.23 This being the case, why are Identity theorists so eager to identify the mental with the physical? It seems to me that their desperate attempts at reduc? tion are rooted in their wanting to do away with "ghost stuff" or private events in scientific explana? tion. Once the mental ceases to be conceived as "ghost stuff" (and it will be shown below24 how this conception is misguided and based on a philo? sophical prejudice), the psychological thrust of the identification loses all its momentum. If we look at the Identity statement still from another standpoint, we cannot fail to realize what are the uncritical ("metaphysical") assumptions that support it. Identity theorists assert that mental statements really refer to brain processes, and that lightning is nothing more than an electric dis? charge. What this amounts to is that the so called "phenomenal" language is viewed as an imperfect way of describing a reality which is better accounted for by a physicalistic framework; for Smart and Place the "real" entities of the world are those implied by physical theory.25 Feigl is more careful in assessing the role of the phenomenal language (he admits that the "private language" is legitimate and has a role in the con? firmation of knowledge claims), but he ultimately believes that the scientifically meaningful is to be identified with the physicalistie-intersubjective lan? guage.26 The phenomenal language is thus relegated to the second place and considered to be a colorful and presently useful tool for the explanation and comprehension of reality, which under appropriate circumstances could perhaps be dispensed with.27 At times Identity theorists seem to be paying only lip service to the irreducibility and legitimacy of the phenomenal (mentalistic) language. There is no wonder that the so-called Displacement theories (Paul Feyerabend, Wilfrid Sellars, Richard Rorty) go a step further and assert that the lan? guage of common sense could be replaced by a more adequate physicalistic language.28 It can be safely said that the proponents of the Displacement theory are only drawing the logical conclusions out of the premisses set forth by Identity theorists, and giving them an extreme form; their reasoning can be traced as follows: since the phenomenal language refers to the same entities referred to by the physical language (in virtue of the identity of reference of "mental" and "physical"), although in a more "imperfect" and "anthropomorphic" form, and since it is not 22 Jaegwon Kim gives as an example the derivation of the Boyle-Charles law of gases from statistical-mechanical assumptions about gases. It is not necessary to interpret the equation that relates temperature and kinetic energy to the effect that tempera? ture is kinetic energy; the equation only asserts that the value of temperature is the same as the value of mean kinetic energy. (Ibid., p. 229.) 23 In fact, the only thing that is achieved by the Identity statement is ontological parsimony; our commitment to entities is reduced. If so, the Identity theory turns out to be a metaphysical theory, not the neutral interpretation of scientific data. 24 On this see below the section: "The mental as phenomenal and private." 25 J. J. C. Smart is a vigorous supporter of Materialism, defined by him as "the theory that there is nothing in the world over and above those entities which are postulated by physics" ("Materialism," The Journal of Philosophy, vol. 60 [1963], p. 651). 26 Herbert Feigl, "The 'Mental' and the 'Physical'," op. cit. p. 477. According to Feigl, mental states can be described in a public-objective language (ibid., p. 448). In fact, Feigl denies all ontological status to acquaintance (which is the main charac? teristic of the mental) ; what is added by acquaintance to the scientific description of a given phenomenon is "cognitively irrelevant imagery" and "pictorial bywork" (ibid., p. 433). Acquaintance as such does not reveal us any further dimension of reality and is relevant only to the rapidity with which we might gain knowledge about the world (ibid., p. 434, 435). 27 J. J. C. Smart in his article "Materialism" refers to a modification of ordinary language in a Feyerabendian vein. 28 Paul Feyerabend believes it to be a psychological and historical accident that ordinary language is accepted as correct and adequate, and not an indication of its absolute truth. According to him it is dogmatic to assume that because ordinary language is successfully used today, it is also adequate and irreplaceable. If the implicit principles that govern the use of the descriptive terms in ordinary language are found to be empirically inadequate (because of the availability of a materialistic-physical theory that describes the facts more adequately), they must be given up and replaced by more suitable ones.

Ill (Minneapolis, 1962), p. 84.</page><page sequence="6">Il6 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY irreducible in any interesting scientific sense,29 it might as well be eliminated to the benefit of an objective and scientific language. This appears to be a consistent elaboration of the Identity view. The question one wants to ask the Identity theorist is: What is the rational justification for relegating the phenomenal language to the second place and for asserting that only the physicalistic language reveals to us the nature of reality? In other words : What is the justification for ontolog ically reducing the explained event ? On pure scientific grounds there seems to be no compelling argument for withholding from the con? cepts of reduced theories their ontological dimen? sion. But opinions are divided in this respect: Nagel, for example, believes that the reduction of' theories is logical and formal and does not entail any ontological elimination of the entities referred to by the concepts of the reduced theory : State? ments are reduced, not properties or entities.30 Accordingly, the methodological reduction points only to a further stage in the development of "Unified Science" and has implications only in so far as it concerns the logical relations between theories. On the other hand, the lack of ontological com? mitment in explanation is challenged by philo? sophers such as Karl Popper, Paul Feyerabend, Richard Rorty, and W. V. O. Quine.31 For Popper, every scientific theory makes an implicit claim to describe something real32 and an explanatory reduction might entail an ontological reduction. Feyerabend goes as far as saying that the ontology of the reducing theory should replace that of the reduced one. Since, according to him, every theory or linguistic framework has an ontology built into it (including "everyday language" or ordinary language),33 if it is found that an existent framework is inconsistent with a newly introduced theory, it has to be abandoned or replaced by the new and better theory (two incompatible ontol? ogies cannot both be true).34 It is clear that Feyerabend's approach departs from the orthodox account of scientific explanation, as exemplified, among others, by Nagel, Hempel,35 and Oppenheim; according to Feyerabend, the elaboration of a more comprehensive theory Tthat explains a theory T' (when both T and T' are empirically adequate within a domain D', while T is also adequate outside D' in a wider domain D) carries with it a replacement of the ontology of T' by that of T36 (and not just an incorporation or a derivation of T' from T) ; in most cases this shift of ontology entails the incommensurability of mean? ing of the main descriptive terms that occur in both theories.37 This view of explanation, when applied to the Mind-Body problem, amounts to asserting that if 29 For Feigl, the phenomenal plays a role only in the confirmation of certain knowledge claims (enabling greater rapidity in confirmation) but is not indispensable for the description or explanation of reality. Smart and Place make it even clearer that the mentalistic language is imperfect, subjective, and "anthropomorphic." 80 Nagel argues against ontological reductionism; that it is wrong to assume that because light is explained as electromagnetic radiation it is to be considered as a phenomenon or appearance while the electromagnetic radiation is hailed as the basic and ultimate reality . . . "if and when the detailed physical and chemical and physiological conditions for the occurrence of headaches are ascertained, headaches will not thereby be shown to be illusory. On the contrary ... all that will have happened is that an explanation will have been found for the occurrence of headaches" (Ernest Nagel, The Structure of Science, op. cit., p. 366; see also pp. 364 and 368). Human behavior could in principle be derivable from the laws of physics and chemistry (instead of being explained in terms of "reasons," "motives," etc.), but this would not entail an ontological elimination of the mental as an illusory appearance. This would only mean that there is not a method of explanation peculiar to the human sciences and that the hypothetico-deductive method is all pervasive. 31 Quine says that "explication is elimination." In referring to the Identity Theory which asserts that mental events are "states of human bodies" he says: "The bodily states exist anyway; why add the others" (Word and Object [Cambridge, i960], p. 264). Quine, following the empiricist tradition, assumes that the "mental" is to be understood as existing "behind" physical behavior, and he henceforth discards it as redundant. 32 Karl Popper, "Three Views Concerning Human Knowledge," Conjectures and Refutations (New York, 1963). 33 Paul Feyerabend, "Comments" on J. J. C. Smart, "Conflicting Views about Explanation," Boston Studies In the Philosophy of Science, vol. 2., op. cit. On p. 240: "a language (a theory) is not only a vehicle for meanings, it is also supposed to inform us about what exists." 34 Paul K. Feyerabend, "Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism," op. cit., p. 76. 35 Carl G. Hempel, Aspects of Scientific Explanation (New York, 1965), esp. ch. IV (on Scientific Explanation). According to the orthodox view, a theory T' is explained by T when it is reduced to or incorporated into the more comprehensive theory T; along this process of reduction, the meaning of the main descriptive terms of both theories remains unchanged (principle of "meaning invariance"). 36 Paul Feyerabend, "Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism," op. cit.. p. 78. 37 For example, the concept "mass" of classical pre-relativistic physics is essentially different from the concept "mass" of general relativity (Feyerabend, ibid., p. 76-80).</page><page sequence="7">THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND-BODY IDENTITY THEORIES 117 mental events (sensations, thoughts, states of awareness) can be accounted for in terms of com? plex central states, the "mental connotation" of mental terms will be replaced by a "physical connotation."38 Richard Rorty holds to the same Feyerabendian view and deals very specifically with the Mind Body problem.39 He believes that the relation of "mind" and "body" in the Identity statement ("consciousness is a brain process") is "the sort of relation which obtains between . . . existent entities and non-existent entities, when reference to the latter once served (some of) the purposes presently served by reference to the former."40 In other words: what people used to call "consciousness" is nothing but a state of the brain ; what people used to call "witches" are nothing but psychotic women; what people used to call "demons" are nothing but hallucinations. According to Rorty, sensations are to the future progress of psychophysiology what demons are to modern science. "Just as we now want to deny that there are demons, future science may want to deny that there are sensations."41 Rorty's view is, then, clearly eliminatory, although it differs from Feyerabend's in that it considers the elimination of the referring use of "sensation" from the language as highly "im? practical" (although possible in principle).42 It seems to me that Feyerabend and Rorty are right in believing that linguistic philosophers can? not prove on merely linguistic grounds (e.g., that the statement "consciousness is a brain process" is a conceptual confusion) the irreducibility of enti? ties.43 But can they prove the reducibility of entities on the basis of a metaphysical interpreta? tion of the nature of scientific explanation ? Identity theorists themselves (Feigl, Smart, Place, Putnam) are not very explicit on the issue of ontological elimination or reduction; they assert the unique reference of two different descriptions ("temperature" and "kinetic energy," or "con? sciousness" and "brain process,") but don't argue for the outright elimination of the explained con? cepts or entities; nevertheless, they do convey the impression, as has already been pointed out, that the physicalistic report is more adequate than the phenomenal one; the mental statement really refers to a brain process and lightning is really electro? magnetic discharge ; not the other way around. In a more general way, the physical is considered by Identity theorists to be the real, while the phenomenal (or mental) is identified with the sub? jective and private. I see in this practice a departure from their scientifically-oriented approach and a clear case of naively resorting to unexamined assumptions ; their being unaware of it only makes their position more vulnerable. That the mental istic-phenomenal language is "subjective" is nothing more than a metaphysical prejudice of scientifically-inclined philosophers. This leads us into the second main issue related to the Identity Theory : II. The Mental as Phenomenal and Private Jerome Schaffer, in his article "Recent Work on the Mind-Body Problem"44 asserts that character? istic of the mental is the occurrence of events 38 Paul Feyerabend, ibid., p. 90. 89 Richard Rorty, "Mind-Body Identity, Privacy and Categories," The Review of Metaphysics, vol. 19 (1965), pp. 24-54. 40 Richard Rorty, ibid., p. 26. 41 Richard Rorty, ibid., p. 30. 42 Ibid., pp. 32, 36. Similarly, in the case of "tables are clouds of molecules," although we could "in principle" drop "table" from our reporting statements, it would be very inconvenient to do so (while it is possible and convenient to drop "demon" (p. 34). But even in the case of observation terms like "table" or "temperature," there is a possibility, after they cease to have a referring use, that we stop using them in non-inferential reports and replace them by their "theoretical" counterparts (which then will become "observational.") 43 Richard Rorty, ibid., p. 54. Feyerabend is right in maintaining that we should not reject materialism (and a purely materialistic language that would do without mentalistic terms) by appealing to the success of the present non-materialistic language; the fact that the everyday language of common sense is successfully used to communicate is not an index of its absolute truth; many useful systems have been found to be inadequate. (See Paul Feyerabend, "Comment on Smart's 'Conflicting Views about Explanation'," in Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, vol. II [New York, 1965], p. 258). According to Feyerabend, it cannot be argued that the mentalistic language is irreducible because it conveys the immediately given in acquaintance and is, therefore, incorrigible; this argument does not hold since, on the grounds of the pragmatic theory of observation Paul Feyerabend, "Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism," pp. 36, 39 it is determined that the "given" is not an absolute concept, and takes different shapes according to the theory in which it is incorporated; thus, the mentalistic "given" can be replaced by a physicalistic "given." 44 Jerome Schaffer, "Recent Work on the Mind-Body Problem," American Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 2 (1965), p. 86.</page><page sequence="8">Il8 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY (feelings, sensations, thoughts) that are private and unobservable, and not describable in public overt behavior; furthermore, there is "privileged access" to them: "the person to whom the events occur knows they occur without having to make the observations or inferences others must make to know of their occurrence." C. D. Broad, in Scientific Thought, contrasts the mental with the physical in the following way : the physical is public ("its existence and properties must be independent of the minds that happen to observe it, and it must be capable of being observed by many minds."45 The mental is private: "a state of mind is private to the person whose state it is." "We talk of my beliefs and your wishes; we do not talk of my hydrogen atom or your electron."46 The identification of the mental with the phenom? enal, private and subjective, being a pervasive theme in all contemporary discussions of the Mind Body Problem, deserves careful and attentive ex? amination. It seems to me that the identification is the outcome of combining elements of several philosophical trends : the Cartesian frame of mind, an empiricist epistemology, and a positivistic approach to knowledge. Let's examine these in detail. The Cartesian dichotomy of "res cogitans" and "res extensa," originally understood as the distinc? tion between the "immaterial" (spiritual) and the "material" (physical), or the "inner" and the "outer," gave place to a similar dichotomy between the "hidden" and the "apparent"; in empiricist terms these last came to be interpreted as the "private" and the "public," the "unobservable" and the "observable," or the "scientifically un? knowable" (i.e., the knowable and confirmable only by direct or immediate experience) and the "knowable" proper (the intersubjectively con? firmable) . In this way the "soul" or "mind" (the "inner" aspect of man), which for Descartes and other rationalists was capable of being clearly and distinctly known (in fact, the nature of the soul is for them more clearly apprehended than that of the body), came to be considered by the empiricists as the "hidden" and basically unknowable aspect of man.47 The mental was thus defined as that element in principle inaccessible to intersubjective (i.e., scientific) description. It was equated with the "given in direct acquaintance" or "private" (only subjectively confirmable), as opposed to the "physical" which became synonymous with objec? tively given, "public" and intersubjectively con? firmable. This last development took place already in the 20th century. More specifically, the identification of the mental with the private can be traced back to the empiri? cist philosophers of the 17th century: drawing the epistemological conclusions from the Cartesian dichotomy of Mind and Body, Locke and his followers considered ideas, impressions, and sensa? tions to be subjective and private representations of the outer physical world. As a result of joining an epistemological dualism to a psychophysical dual? ism, the mental came to be defined as the sub? jective, phenomenal and private, or as the immedi? ately perceived by an immaterial mind or subject. The historical kinship of contemporary analytic philosophy to English empiricism accounts for this distortion of the mental dimension of the human being and for its misleading identification with the subjective and phenomenal, that is, with an inner world of images, sense data, and appearances (the "phenomenal" world). That the mental can be defined in an altogether different way is obvious from a consideration of the rationalist approach, as represented, among others, by Spinoza and Leibniz. They conceived the "mental" as an objective aspect of reality: Spinoza's "ideas" are not the hidden and private counter? parts of the modes of extension but an essential and objective expression of the infinite substance. Leibniz' "perception" is the very essence of the 46 C. D. Broad, Scientific Thought (New York, 1923), p. 229. 46 G. D. Broad, ibid., p. 230. It seems to me that Broad draws the wrong conclusion from his linguistic examples; if I can say "my belief" but not "my electron," it is not because "belief" is mental while "electron" is physical. I can talk meaningfully of "a belief," and two or more persons can share a belief; how would this be possible if "belief" was essentially "private" ? Notice also that I can say "my leg," but not "our leg," although leg is, by Broad's own standards, a public object (its existence is independent of the minds that happen to observe it). There is no doubt that mental events (beliefs, opinions) have at times a different logic than physical events; I say "my belief" and "my chair," and the word "my" points to a different relation of possession in both cases. Nevertheless, it seems to me that this issue is independent of the dichotomy public-private. 47 A plausible explanation of this development can be found in the fact that for a rationalist like Descartes there is a higher intellectual faculty able to grasp the nature of the immaterial soul, while for an empiricist like Hume there is no possibility of knowing that which is "hidden" and inaccessible to sensuous perception since all knowledge is ultimately rooted in the senses.</page><page sequence="9">THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND-BODY IDENTITY THEORIES 119 monads and has more objective reality than the physical world of phenomena. In this sense modern rationalism is heir to the ancient Greek tradition as exemplified in Aristotle48 according to whom the "mental" is the form or essence of reality; in modern terms we could say its meaning.*9 But the merging of the Cartesian and the Empiricist traditions leaves still unexplained the reductionism implicit in the Identity Theory. Here the influence of physicalism provides the additional link. Most of the contemporary proponents of the Identity Theory combine their empiricist interpre? tation of mind as the "hidden," "unobservable," and "private" aspect of the human being, with a physicalistic approach; in this respect they are heirs to the logico-positivist tradition, other minor differences notwithstanding.50 An examination of Carnap's physicalistic interpretation of psychology (advanced as early as 1932-33)51 will make this claim clear. Carnap based his physicalistic approach to human beings on two main assumptions concerning the nature of the cognitively meaningful : (a) The meaningful is the testable: "A sentence says no more than what is testable about it;"52 "something has meaning for me only if I can test it."53 State? ments concerning psychological states, especially those that refer to the past or to other minds are not testable and hence not meaningful, (b) A psycho logical sentence, if meaningful, has the same con? tent as the physical sentence corresponding to it, and doesn't assert anything over and above it. If it did, it would be untestable and therefore meaning? less; "the psychological sentence P, 'A is excited', refers to the physical structure of A's body"54; "every psychological sentence refers to physical occurrences in the body of the person . . . con? cerned. .. ;" "psychology is a branch of physics."55 The assumption behind these statements is that if the psychological sentence referred to something psychical it would be unverifiable, and hence meaningless. Although Carnap subsequently revised this criterion of explicit definability (of psychological states and events in terms of overt behavior) and substantively modified it, his approach is interesting in two respects : (i) The characterization of "meaningful" as some? how related to a verification procedure (in its rigid or loose form), and the connected assumption that a meaningful expression is one that "refers" in one way or other to a physical state of affairs. (2) The interpretation of the mental as a hidden aspect of the person, an "occult property" or "obscure power."56 These two assumptions put together lead to the assertion that the mental (understood as an occult and hidden property), being unverifiable, is mean? ingless. D 48 On the Soul, Bk. II. It is true that Plato's conception of the soul as an incorporeal substance which is separable from the body (Meno, Phaedo) could give support to the empiricist interpretation of mind as "ghost stuff." But then, it is not clear whether Plato's theory was not meant to be only an epistemological account of the possibility of true knowledge and not an ontological account of the nature of the soul. The fact that whenever Plato deals with the soul he either uses a highly metaphorical language or goes about telling a myth or story would seem to point in this direction; it would be a mistake to interpret his theories in the literal sense. The metaphorical character of his language is obvious in statements like: "That soul, I say, herself invisible, departs to the invisible world?to the divine and immortal and rational . . . and forever dwells, as they say of the initiated, in company with the gods." (Phaedo.) 49 It is interesting to note that contemporary philosophers like Merleau-Ponty and Wittgenstein interpret the mental as providing a meaning dimension to the physical. (See my article "Mind-Body reexamined: Wittgenstein and Merleau-Ponty on Man" (forthcoming). 60 Identity theorists avoid the extreme behaviorism (and the outright elimination of the mental) characteristic of early positivist approaches: but their solution (one referent described in two different ways) doesn't succeed in concealing their physicalism : true, the mental is not translatable to the physical; but the human being can be accurately described and explained in physical terms (according to Feigl, Smart, Place, and Putnam this is why mental reports are not "genuine" and have a role only in the confirmation of knowledge claims; the mental is not an essential component of the human being; the scientifically meaningful is the intersubjectively describable in physical language. 61 Rudolf Carnap, "Psychology in Physical language," in A.

The empiricist identification of the mental with the private, and the related "physicalistic" dismissal of mental reports as "not genuine" is one of their cornerstones. That this identification of the mental with the "hidden" and "private" is not to be uncritically accepted and is, as we saw, a historical accident can best be seen if we compare it with other approaches to the mental: the phenomenological movement has called attention to the fact that the "phenom? enal" language (or mentalistic language) is not less objective or intersubjective than the physical? istic language of science. A philosopher like Maurice Merleau-Ponty stresses the intersubjective and rational character of the phenomenal world of experience and dismisses as erroneous the assump? tion that only physical science accounts for objec? tivity and reality. The phenomenal field is no longer explained, as is the case with most analytic philos? ophers, as the subjective and private, or as a state of consciousness (or psychical fact), but as already giving rise to the intersubjective realm of experi? ence. "Perception is a nascent logos."58 Put in another way: Merleau-Ponty is saying that what we perceive is not a sum of private sensations, but the world from a certain perspective. The phenomenal world (the world as it is given and revealed to us) is "real" in so far as it is meaningful and has logic and an articulation of its own. In the "formal" mode of speech, this amounts to asserting that the language of common sense is as acceptable and legitimate as the language of science. The metaphysical prejudices of Identity theorists and their empiricist interpretation of mind as a "hidden power" or an "immaterial (non-physical) entity," which was so obvious in Carnap's early positivism,59 has left its trace in a still more subtle form: the way Identity theorists misinterpret and misunderstand the dualistic position that argues for the irreducibility of the mental to the physical. III. The Misunderstanding of the Dualistic Position by Identity Theorists Identity theorists attribute to the dualists the belief that consciousness has a separate (and even independent) existence, i.e., that mental states are something "over and above" physical processes (to use Smart's terms). As we have already seen, the interpretation of the mental as an inner something, an immaterial entity or property that exists "behind" (or "over and above") the physical is an empiricist distortion of the terms "mind" and "mental." The conception of the mental as immaterial stuff, "subtle matter" or hidden and occult property, is the legacy of the empiricist tradition60 which tried to make sense of the mental by attributing to it a special kind of immaterial existence. As a matter of fact, the intel lectualistic or rationalistic tradition never adopted this point of view since it wasn't restricted by the narrow criteria of philosophical acceptability61 that hampered the empiricists. That the Identity theorists misunderstood the dualistic position, attributing to it an empiricist conception of the mental, is indisputable ; accord? ing to Carnap, for example, the dualist philosopher is asserting that "He is angry" means: "besides acting as he does, he now has a feeling of anger (which is not meant as a physical state of affairs) ."62 "Mr. A is excited" means that "Mr. A not only has a body whose physical structure ... is described by P2, but?since he is a psychophysical being?he has, besides, a consciousness, a certain power or entity, in which that excitement is to be found."63 Place and Smart both assume that the dualistic view they criticize supports the same na?ve inter? pretation of the mental. Smart's thesis "Sensations are nothing over and above brain processes"64 is 57 Even if, in most cases, this amounts only to paying lip service to the "meaningfulness" of the mental (See above pp. 11-12). 58 Maurice Merleau-Ponty, "The primacy of Perception" in The Primacy of Perception and other Essays (Evanston, 1964), p. 41. See also Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception (New York, 1962). 59 Rudolf Carnap, "Psychology in Physical Language," op. cit., p. 173: "Consciousness is a certain power or entity in which . . . excitement is to be found." Since nothing can be known by definition, of this mysterious entity, its existence remains unverifiable; hence the conclusion that psychological sentences, if they assert more than the physical sentences corresponding to them, are meaningless. 60 Think for example, of Gassendi. 61 Only the physical is intelligible and verifiable. 62 Rudolf Carnap, ibid., p. 176. 63 Rudolf Carnap, ibid., p. 173. 64 J. J. C. Smart, op. cit., p. 163.</page><page sequence="11">THE METAPHYSICS OF MIND-BODY IDENTITY THEORIES 121 contrasted with the alleged dualistic assertion that sensations are something over and above brain processes. According to Place, the dualist is arguing that "sensations and mental images form a separate category of processes over and above the physical and physiological processes with which they are correlated."65 It is questionable whether a modern dualist, like N. Malcolm or Roderick Chisholm, holds the view attributed to him by Identity theorists. As a matter of fact, the dualist's claim that the mental is irreducible to the physical doesn't entail (or imply) the separate existence of a "soul," or, to use one of Smart's colorful expressions, "ghost stuff," existing side by side with "physical stuff." The dualist is only resisting the attempt to describe man in purely physical terms and to explain away his mental dimension.66 Identity theorists, because imprisoned in their narrow conceptual framework, fail to recognize that it is possible to defend the "irreducibility" of the mental to the physical without assuming a na?ve dualistic ontology. They seem to believe that the only alternative to a Cartesian dualism of Mind and Body is a monistic materialism (an Identity Theory) according to which the mental (although untranslatable to the physical) would denote or refer to physical states and processes. But it is possible, once the empiricist conception of the mental is abandoned, to conceive of an ontologically monistic approach to man that would allow for the reality and meaningfulness of the mental without committing itself to the Identity of reference of the mental and the physical (which, as we have already seen, is reductive and eliminative). Merleau-Ponty and Wittgenstein67 exemplify this position in which the mental is integrated within the physical (and understood as one of its dimensions) instead of being reduced to the physical. As a matter of fact, the question of the reduction of the laws of psychology to the laws of physics (the program of unified science68) is independent of the issue between materialism and idealism (the ques? tion about the basic "stuff" of reality).69 It is possible to hold a materialistic view of man (man is his body, there is no "ghost stuff") and yet claim that the laws of psychology are not reducible to the laws of physics. Both Merleau-Ponty and Wittgen? stein adopt this line of philosophizing: granted man is his body; but to understand this body you need more than just physical categories. Identity Theorists, blinded by their efforts to overcome an artificial dichotomy of the "mental" and the "physical," hampered by a distorted con? ception of the mental as the subjective and private, and misguided by their belief in the physicalistic objective language of science as the only standard of rationality, were driven to a dubious identification of the mental with the physical and to a proble? matic ontological reductionism. Their theory, far from being "scientific" and capable of being con? firmed by future empirical evidence, amounts only to a good piece of philosophical speculation. This shows once again how even the most scientific of philosophers is not immune to the so called meta? physical "disease," although he might be candidly unaware of his being affected by it.

Place, op. cit., p. 102. 68 Malcolm, for example, believes that the occurrence of a sudden thought cannot be stated solely in terms of the entities and laws of physics; in this sense an explanation of a mental event differs in kind from an explanation of a physical event.
