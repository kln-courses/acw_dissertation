ISBN: 9780814330241. doi:10.1017/S0038713413003163 Ephraim Kanarfogel has trawled the manuscript remains of the Tosafists, French and German rabbis of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. His painstaking spadework has yielded a panoramic view of their scholarly activity, which it seems was not only vast but diverse. Intellectual History reconsiders the Tosafists' reputation for focusing almost en- tirely on Talmud and law, and it shifts attention from the glosses on the Babylonian Talmud, which were their main achievement, to their contributions to biblical exegesis, liturgical poetry, and mysticism. Kanarfogel's thesis implies that the term "Tosafists" can no longer be deemed an adequate characterization of the rabbis whose writings he examines. Joseph Bekhor Shor, Jacob of Orléans, and Yom Tov of Joigny continued to deploy the literalist (peshat) hermeneutic that was the hallmark of twelfth-century France, but they began integrating this kind of analysis with midrashic interpretation, in an approach that harked back to Rashi and returned to popularity in the thirteenth century. A battery of exegetical techniques, including numerology and letter manipulation, supplemented lit- eral interpretation in the commentaries of Judah "the Pious" of Regensburg and some of his followers, while Eleazar of Worms, his leading devotee, concentrated on mystical in- terpretation. Kanarfogel excavates the exegesis of Isaiah di Trani, Moses of Coucy, Yehiel of Paris, and the Tosafists of Évreux, all of whom delve into talmudic and midrashic sources. The exegetical pattern persists in the latter thirteenth century, although at this point Tosafist exegesis assumes the form of anonymous group writings. Intellectual History establishes that the Tosafists and Pietists were also active in the realm of liturgical poetry, and not only in the genres of dirges and penitential poetry as has been generally held. Kanarfogel emphasizes that although the increased presence of lamenta- tions is attributable to the period's spate of violent, tragic incidents, the choice of venue was partially determined by the availability of liturgical slots not already occupied by the compositions of classical - by now canonical - poets. Turning to Tosafist activity in the realms of magic and mysticism, we learn that while the twelfth-century luminaries dis- tanced themselves from mystical speculation, their disciples and later Tosafists revived these Speculum 88/4 (October 2013)</page><page sequence="2">1116 Reviews interests. This trend seems to parallel the dynamic regarding biblical exegesis, in which a decision to focus on literal interpretation was reversed in favor of the more integrative approach that had characterized pre-Tosafist scholarship. Metaphysical issues round out the discussion, and anthropomorphism serves as a case study. Kanarfogel rejects the characterization of the Tosafists' thought as anthropomor- phic, as well as the assumption that they did not engage in metaphysical speculation. Judah the Pious and his followers were inclined towards the rationalist stance of Sacadia and Maimonides on anthropomorphism, for which they were blasted by Moses Taku, who identified with a mythical view characteristic of early Ashkenazic thought. Kanarfogel nu- ances Taku's position, arguing that Taku held that God has no form but assumes forms as situations may require. Intellectual History addresses several general problems concerning the rabbinic culture of medieval Ashkenaz. The term "Tosafist" has been applied to the rabbis of both France and Germany, and Kanarfogel teases out the similarities and differences between the at- titudes, activities, and relationships of the scholars in both lands. For example, we learn that for several decades (1180-1220) rabbinical authorities engaged in judicial activity ex- tensively in Germany yet hardly at all in France. No conclusive explanation for this di- vergence emerges, but we learn that it is part of a larger pattern, for at this time ties loos- ened between the French and German rabbinic leaders. A long-standing challenge of singular importance has been to explain the nearly simul- taneous appearance of dialectic, in the late eleventh or early twelfth century, among Tosafists and Scholastics alike. Kanarfogel emphasizes that, while there is no evidence that rabbis knew Latin, they could have learned of the new methodology through verbal ex- changes with Christian scholars. Indeed, the German Pietists refer explicitly to "gentile dialectics." The penitential practices of these Pietists and the various iterations of Bernard of Chartres's analogy of latter-day thinkers to dwarfs on the shoulders of giants are fur- ther evidence that the rabbis of medieval France and Germany were aware of Christian intellectual and spiritual trends. The mode of presentation in Intellectual History is the book's glaring drawback. A great deal of microscopic attention is devoted to identifying the authors of manuscripts, which is a vitally important scholarly task but one with which only specialists will engage. The chapters on exegesis present scores of discrete biblical interpretations by the medieval au- thorities where a more synthetic and concise approach would have sufficed. Above all, the book is replete with rabbinic terms and expressions that are neither translated nor explained, and the rabbis' names are rendered in the conventional abbreviations and trans- literations by which they are known in yeshiva parlance. This linguistic approach offers limited access to readers from beyond the book's immediate orbit. The intellectual achieve- ments of the rabbinic giants of medieval France and Germany should be of great interest to scholars dedicated to studying the world of Peter Abelard or Rupert of Deutz, and those who take up the challenge of Hugh of Saint- Victor and his Hebraist disciples will reap the benefits of Kanarfogel's chef d'oeuvre.
