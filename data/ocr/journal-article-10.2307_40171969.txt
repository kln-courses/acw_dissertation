<plain_text><page sequence="1">Three Measures of a Teacher's Potential JOHN E. ERICKSON Once upon a time (1968), 56 young men and women rose from their chairs in an auditorium of a large midwestern univer- sity (University of Illinois) leaving behind the last of three measures of their potential as teachers of English. They had completed the Teaching Area Examination in English Language and Literature of the National Teacher Examination. Previously, the University supervisors had duly recorded their measure of each candidate, and before that 3,000 public school students had recorded their reactions to the 56 student teachers using the Illinois Teacher Evaluation Questionnaire. The young men and women left the University to take posi- tions as teachers, to become wives and mothers, to continue their studies, and to undertake other adventures. It is too early, yet, to finish their stories. Meanwhile, the three measures found themselves together among other reports, computer printouts, read and unread journals, texts, and University communications. Feeling somewhat ignored by the rest of the debris and intuiting a common ancestry, they began to examine what they had in common. Thus they discovered that they each represented a different preception of the same 56 candidates whose stories are not yet finished.

"Of course, I only have a measure of each candidate's knowledge of English literature and language," it avowed, "but I should certainly think that a good teacher of English would be well acquainted with the authors, writings, genres, periods, and schools of criticism which make up the literary heritage of the English-speaking people as well as the structure and standard usage of mechanics of the language itself. "My records indicate that, on the whole, our 56 candidates scored higher than the national average of all college seniors of whom I have taken measure." "There's more to being a good teacher than knowing facts," blurted out the University supervisor's record somewhat gruffly. It had been sandwiched in between the other two measures and was painfully aware that it had no figures to speak of, just grades. "A good teacher is more than knowledge, it's (reverse anthropomorphism) being organized, having objectives, being attentive to details, being politic, having stamina, and keeping order!" "A lot you know," interrupted the Illinois Teacher Evalu- ation Questionnaire. "Teachers teach students, don't they? Although I'm new at this game, I know that. If a teacher is any good at all the students will know it, and I've got the data here to prove it." As often happens when relatives get together, the biases which made leaving home in the first place not only bearable but logical, rise to the surface and carry their carriers' voices with them. Such was the case with the three measures who soon forgot their interest in what made them related as they loudly maintained the validity of their own points of view. Soon the noise of their pages' rustling disturbed an old stat book lying beneath them. "Quiet! I'm sleeping," it ordered. This was not exactly true, of course, that it was sleeping. It was obviously awake.</page><page sequence="3">Three Measures 97 "Have you been eavesdropping on our family discussion?" NTE icily inquired. "That was no discussion," the old stat book retorted. "That was stupid bickering. I'd really like to get back to sleep. But until you three find some way of settling your argument, I know you'll be yelling and waking me every five minutes. Here, I'll help you. You may discover that each of you is right about what makes a good teacher. You, NTE, may discover that knowledge correlates positively with grade in student teaching, meaning organization, stamina, et cetera, which correlates posi- tively with ITEQ's student judgment." "And if we don't?" queried the supervisors' report. "I prefer to think positively," stated the stat book. "But, if you don't, if you discover you are not positively related, you should have enough good manners to be civil to each other." The three measures agreed to the experiment and yielded their data to the stat book which rustled and coughed for several hours before becoming silent. "Are you still awake?" inquired ITEQ. "Yes," replied the stat book. "Well?" all three measures intoned. "Well what?" the state book retorted. "Are we related?" "Yes and no," hedged the book. "The relationship which exists between the NTE and ITEQ at a P. of .005 for test of independence is negative .395. And . . ." "Cut the crap!" barked the supervisors' record. "Speak English. Are we related or not?" "Well, all right. But if I do, don't misconstrue what I'm saying. Remember, I'm putting mathematical relationships into your language, and I'm not trying to pass myself off as an expert translator."</page><page sequence="4">98 English Education "Get on with it!" implored NTE. After a few more rustlings, the old stat book began. "The relationship between the grade earned by the candidate in student teaching and the score recorded for the same candidate on the Illinois Teacher Examination Questionnaire is positively related beyond a doubt. However, there is no need for the two of you to take a great deal of comfort from that because your relation- ship, though certain, is weak. In only about 12 cases in 100, on the average, could you predict with certainty that the candidate with the highest grade in student teaching would score the highest with the students on the ITEQ, and vice versa. However, you are certainly related; cousins, perhaps. "Now, as for the relationship between the supervisors' grades and NTE's English Literature and Language Examination, I can say that no significant relationship exists. The correlation (r) is- .092." "What does that mean?" snapped NTE rather testily. "It means you're not related. That what you, NTE, mea- sure is not related to what you, supervisors' grades, measure and vice versa. "As for NTE and ITEQ, I can say positively that you are related; but not in the way you had imagined. Quite the oppo- site, in fact. According to these figures here, in about 16 cases out of 100 the candidate who scores highest with NTE will score lowest with ITEQ and vice versa." "What about the other 84 cases?" asked NTE plaintively. "Who knows?" the old stat book replied. "Chances are that they will relate negatively, but some will relate positively. We can only predict for certain (or near to it) that about 16 will relate negatively." "There is one other thing that I discovered while rooting through your data. ITEQ also has a measure of knowledge of subject matter. The students were asked to rate the candidate on how well they knew their subjects. I compared those scores</page><page sequence="5">Three Measures 99 with yours, NTE. They are related, all right. But again they are negative. Apparently you and the kids in school don't see eye to eye on what knowing the subject means." "Are you through?0 the supervisors' grade report asked. "Well," the stat book smiled, "you could wrap it up by saying if ITEQ and student teaching grades are cousins, then the grades and NTE are strangers and NTE and ITEQ are probably in-laws. But as long as you are all together anyway, why not make the best of it?" "Make the best of it!" All three measures exploded into such a fury of rustling that they tipped off the pile and fluttered into the waste can beside the desk. Their voices could still be heard, somewhat hollowly, and more distant. The old stat book wished it could have done more for them, but after a few minutes it forgot what had disturbed it, and a few minutes later was asleep.
