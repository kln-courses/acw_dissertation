<plain_text><page sequence="1">326 Reviews Savage Ruskin. By PATRICK CONNER. London and New York: Macmillan. I979. xiv + I89 pp. L8.95. Strangely for a book with such a strident headline for a title, it is not an aggressive but a strained Ruskin who emerges from Patrick Conner's study. The object may be, as the author says, to show him as the scourge of academicians and Bradford millionaires alike, yet the implication of a prophet self-assured and single-minded to the point of arrogance, lashing his society, its tastes and morals, with merciless energy, is not borne out by the mixture of commentary, biography, and critical analysis which Dr Conner offers. The study turns more on Ruskin's basic premises and principles, notably his persistent linking of artistic and moral qualities, than on his relations with the Victorian public. It sets out the various angles and conse- quences of this sometimes violent yoking together, tracing the movement of Ruskin's logic from the connexions he saw between the individual artist's character and his creations, through the social inferences to be drawn from architectural style (was the carver happy in his work ?), to his ultimate shift from the indirect to the direct interpretation of society's maladies and sins. Dr Conner handles these issues succinctly, if sometimes in too summary a way, and his familiarity with the context of art and architectural criticism in the I83os and I 84os from which Ruskin developed his own extremely idiosyncratic approach is one of the most useful aspects of the book. His discussion of the readiness to apply the concept of 'expres- sion' to buildings as well as to faces in pictures, together with the general tendency to anthropomorphism in the age's critical and creative life, is particularly sugges- tive, though from a literary point of view the brief allusion to Dickens in this con- text is disappointingly superficial. Dr Conner maintains that Ruskin's life story is indispensable if his aesthetic and moral ideas and the ensuing social judgements are to be properly understood. This may to a point be so, but the biographical account provided is merely a routine outline of familiar facts and circumstances, which does not work very effectively to justify the claim. Indeed these sections of the book tend to reduce its status to that of an introductory survey instead of the critically stimulating study promised in its best areas of research into Victorian approaches to the arts. And no Punch lampoon of a savage Ruskin can withstand the pathos of his personal history, with its testi- mony to the vulnerable, often bewildered, painfully disillusioned man who found that noble art had little to do with noble character, that England refused to join St George's Guild, and who, finally, was tormented by the black storm wind. Dr Conner therefore distracts attention in this biographical way, too, from his avowed focus on Ruskin's public impact. Angry dialogues between Ruskin and his audience did of course occur, and both the nature of his rhetorical tactics and the response to his often extravagant views need more scrutiny, but this is not the study to supply it or even to open up the topic very far, despite its intentions. On the other hand, it does not diminish the stature or the fascination of Ruskin as a crucial presence in his age, albeit one whose fury is less central than his indomitable struggle to drive society's rocking chariot with his unruly team of art harnessed to morals. UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS PATRICIA M. BALL New Perspectives on Melville. Edited by FAITH PULLIN. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 1978. xii + 314 PP- ?8.50. The editor of this collection of essays asserts in the first sentence of her preface that it 'is designed to present a specifically Anglo-American view of Melville'. Had she not done this, I suspect I would have felt merely benign approval when I noticed</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 327 that the contributors dwelt on both sides of the Atlantic; for the essays themselves would not have suggested a calculated Anglo-American design. I prefer this. It demonstrates that Melville has successfully made the ocean passage. The format of the book is chronological. It begins with 'Melville's Typee: The Failure of Eden' by Miss Pullin. She identifies the subject of his first novel as 'the relativity of all social and cultural values' (p. 26) and because it was one which haunted him to the end, it is an appropriate starting-place. The cross-cultural ramifications of Typee also fit her editorial design. The essays which follow include: 'Mardi: Creating the Creative', by Richard H. Brodhead; 'Shakespeare and Melville's America', by Larzer Ziff; 'Melville's England', by Arnold Goldman; 'Moby-Dick: The Tale and the Telling', by A. Robert Lee; 'Unnecessary Dupli- cates: A Key to the Writing of Moby-Dick', by Harrison Hayford; 'The Flawed Grandeur of Melville's Pierre', by Brian Higgins and Hershel Parker; 'Melville: The 1853-6 Phase', by Q. D. Leavis; 'Orpheus and Measured Forms: Law, Madness and Reticence in Melville', by Eric Mottram; 'Melville, Lt Guert Gansevoort and Authority: An Essay in Biography', by Eric Homberger; and 'An Organic Hesitancy: Theme and Style in Billy Budd', by C. N. Manlove. The essays are of high quality and, except for the poetry, confront most of Melville's significant writing, usually in some depth and judiciously. It is a curious fact that though acclaimed for at least one masterpiece, Melville is not thought of as a master, at least not in the way that Henry James is. Yet these essays imply his mastery in their high seriousness, in the close attention they pay his texts, in their defence of his obfuscations, in their concern with his processes of creativity, in their recognition of his moral nicety, and maybe most of all in their efforts to explain his flaws. Only the essays by Professors Ziff and Goldman conform neatly to Miss Pullin's 'Anglo-American confrontation with Melville' (p. vii). Professor Ziff concludes that Melville 'took his intensity from a narrowed focus on Shakespeare's blackness' (p. 63), and Professor Goldman, using Washington Irving as a counter, and Redburn and Israel Potter as his principal evidence, maintains that Melville dis- covered 'that there is no England for an American, that England is not the father of an American man' (p. 73). There is not much of the transatlantic in Eric Mottram's wide-voyaging discussion, which charts conflicts between governance and individuals organically incapable of submission, or in C. N. Manlove's parallel argument that language and style in Billy Budd is an 'attack on the values of civilization' (p. 287). Essays devoted essentially to Melville's art likewise scant his transatlantic side. The most provocative deal with his putative failures. Thus Richard Brodhead parades the defects of Mardi but admires its 'sheer audacity' (p. 30). Taking his cue from Lombardo, the bard of Mardi, he locates in its improvizations a creative method Melville would employ thereafter. For Brian Higgins and Hershel Parker, Pierre is 'the best psychological novel that has yet been written in English' (p. 193), and one that might have been even better had not Melville, half-way through, become engrossed by his personal difficulties in the market-place (harsh reviews of MAoby-Dick and trouble selling his new manuscript) and shifted attention for inside narrative of Pierre to his own adventures in the literary world. Hershel Parker previously published documentary evidence for his surmises about the dire result of Melville's business trip to New York in early I853, and here he and his colla- borator add support derived from Pierre itself. The cetological centre of New Perspectives is two essays on the formal art of Moby- Dick. Robert Lee, responding to Evert Duyckinck's complaint in an I85I review that the novel lacks 'any distinct classification of form', notes that Moby-Dick involves the factuality of the tale and the fictive devices of its telling. Together tale and telling rescue the book from 'routine charges of failure in formal wholeness' 22</page><page sequence="3">(p. 126). Harrison Hayford finds the book less tidy and integrated. He calls atten- tion to duplication of characters, settings, objects, and events that is hard to justify artistically but which seems to reflect the genesis and revisions of the manuscript. This reworking reminds him of the 'cobbling sort of business' that the Pequod's carpenter grumbles about when he has to make a lifebuoy from a coffin. Hayford's essay is a delight. Mrs Leavis's discussion of the short fiction emphasizes its range, its comic and satiric subtleties, and its reflections of the problems of the writer who has to earn his living. She finds the tales and sketches 'more condensed, controlled and mature than either Moby-Dick or Pierre' (p. 197) and important landmarks in his progress toward The Confidence-Man. Her essay disappoints because we have come to expect so much of her. It is marred by trivial errors of fact (for example, 'Melville could find no public for his fiction after his early phase as a writer of adventure books' (p. I97); the Harper's fire of 1853 destroyed 'the plates of all his novels' (p. 199); The Lightning-Rod Man 'was refused magazine publication' (p. 208)) and, it seems to me, by extravagances of opinion, for example her high regard ('almost in- exhaustible' (p. 204)) for Cock-a-Doddle-Doo! But her reading of The Confidence- Man, which she identifies with 'the novel of philosophic speculation' (p. 204) such as Rasselas and Candide, is helpful, and her reminder that this, Melville's last published fiction, is replete with 'moral feeling and demand for moral courage in social life' (p. 223) is salubrious and applicable to the entire canon. UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA HENNIG COHEN The New Woman and the Victorian Novel. By GAIL CUNNINGHAM. London and New York: Macmillan. 1978. viii + 172 pp. ?8.95. It was Kipling's opinion (a view intermittently still current) that a woman is only a woman, while a good cigar is a smoke. This book deals with one of the recurrent phases of history in which the female of the species has taken up the challenge of the cigar. Dr Cunningham traces the emergence of the 'New Woman' in the English novel during the final decades of the nineteenth century, and illustrates the intensity of her revolt against the contemporary values, especially those governing sexual morality. The 'New Woman' was not just a character in fiction, but a social phenomenon. Her appearance was literature's response to a convulsion of its society, the revalua- tion of women's role and relevance: a process which is continuing with evident vitality today. Consequently it is no longer possible for a critic to approach the subject in the downright way of literary criticism. Such a method would seem not so much old-fashioned as deliberately evasive. Dr Cunningham's book is inevitably something of a hybrid, since the area which she covers is not purely literary, but sociological, political, and historical too. The first section consists of a brief account of 'the variety of the controversies which rocked the nineties', in law, education, science, and religion. The 'New Woman' who arose like Aphrodite from the foam of these troubled waters was, as Dr Cunningham shows, in origin essentially a journalistic creation. The popular press, delighting in what Punch termed her 'Ibscenity', saw her as the 'Girl of the Period' gone wrong, a female tortured by unexpressed sensuality, haunted by unmention- able sexual secrets, kicking wildly against convention, either trapped in a joyless union or slamming the door upon her husband and children. This meretricious stereotype was widely exploited for maximum emotional and financial effect. Yet not all writers were interested purely on the sensationalist level; and the third and 328 Reviews</page></plain_text>
