<plain_text><page sequence="1">HIlWI AL-BALKHI A Comparative Study (Continued from JQR, N. S. XXXVIII [1948] 317-342) By JUDAH ROSENTHAL College of Jewish Studies, Chicago The ZOROASTRIANS. Pseudo-Bachya (eleventh century) makes Hiwi a follower of the Magi, which means that he was a Zoroastrian."13 This is repeated by Maimon ibn Danan (second half of the fifteenth century) in his chronicle. nrl-In CUoD WY -.II4 The theory of Zoroastrian influence on Hiwi deserves attention. The conquest of Persia by Islam in the middle of the seventh century resulted in the downfall of Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Persia. But the conversion to Islam did not take place at once. We have ample evidence of the survival of the Zoroastrian religion during the following three centuries.IIS The polemical literature of the eighth and ninth centuries, as well as the Gaonic literature, has numerous references to Zoroastrians.1"6 The latter took part in religious disputa- tions in the defense of their High God Ormuzd.1I7 They maintained that the Bible and all religions based on reve- lation, such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, were the work of the devil Ahriman. The diabolic origin of the Bible is asserted throughout the Pahlavi literature of the period.118 11 Cf. Davidson, op. cit. 99.

The work of Martan Faruk, although available in an English translation, has attracted little attention among Jewish scholars.120 David Kaufmann was the first to consider it a source of Ijiwi's heresy.12I Davidson on the other hand, made but little use of it in his edition of Saadia's reply to IjiWi,I22 while Edmund Stein in his recent study of Hiwi likewise underestimates it.I23 The chief purpose of Martan Faruk's work was to refute the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Manich- aeism. He points out the apparent inconsistencies and contradictions in the Scriptures of other religions. Chapters 13 and 14 of the compilation deal specifically with the Old Testament and the Jewish religion. The former treats of the story of creation as told in the Bible. The main counter arguments adduced by Martan Faruk are: 1) The narrative lacks details about the position and limits of the earth. (Was the earth limited or not? If so, ri9 By Pahlavi we understand the language of Persian literature from the middle of the third century until the Islamic conquest of Persia. Pahlavi is identical with Parthian or Middle-Persian. Cf., Grundriss, I, 1.249. 120 The original Pahlavi text of this work has not yet been discovered. Only the Pazdan-Sanskrit version of this work dating from the 12th century is in existence. The Pazdan and Sanskrit texts were published in the year 1887 in Bombay. An English translation of this work by E. W. West appeared in the Sacred Books of the East, vol. XXIV (Ox- ford, 1885) pp. 116-251. See Grundriss, II, 116-7. 1,I REJ, XXII, 287-288. A French translation by James Darmesteter of chaps. XIII-XIV, which appeared in REJ XVIII, 1-15, attracted the attention of Kaufmann and he compared the attacks of Martin Faruk against the Bible with the criticisms of Uiwi. 022 Davidson, op. cit. 29 f., 80-82.

See J. Scheftelowitz, Die altpersische Religion und das Judentum, 7. The anthropomorphic literature of the gaonic period, the Mysticism of the Yorde Merkabah, developed under the influence of such questions. Cf. P. Bloch, "Die jiidische Mystik und Kabbala," in WVinter und Wunsche, III, 223 ff.; G. Sholem, Major Trends in Jew- ish Mysticism, 62 ff. The passages 50-63 and 68-91 form a long dis- cussion against the biblical conception of God, particularly as it is expressed in the narrative of the creation of light. The author tries to show that the story of the creation of light as told in the Bible implies a dualistic conception of God, and that the God of the Bible is inferior and weaker than Ormuzd (Zoroastrians held that their religion was monotheistic. See Grundriss, II, 629-630). The story of the creation played a great role in the development of Jewish mysticism. Rabbinic Judaism solved the difficulties dealt with by our author through the conception that light was not created by God, but that it emanated from God's splendor. God's splendor was the beginning of all creation. See Gen. r. 3.4 (ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 20): gpoym ino inim m-m p1no 190D ,ly 61ln xpDoD rn il't p'^ntm n6vz .m. Philo expresses the same view in words similar to those of the Haggadah. See Freudenthal. Alexander Polyhistor. I, 71. Ch. Albeck, Introduction to Gen. r. p. 86. Many haggadic sayings express the opinion that light was not created at the same time as the world, but that it had existed before. See Bahir, 3 (quoted by Kasher in his n6rv nnin s. 1.): nnnvi 'moirnl -R J16D -IV ;rny bt-11.1 -11m. nt 1OU1lpt "'B9tl : ''1m., rh 0' nhn 61y" -.1ri Dp ,13Y 'hl' ,im "-n n:8:z.r nn1ho m'x ;'tl nrzrv minzn.

The Bible says expressly that the sun was created only on the fourth day.127 5) Why did God rest on the seventh day?"28 6) There existed already in the first days of the created world a contradiction between the will of God and the will and the desire of Adam and Eve. If despite God's will that Adam and Eve should obey Him, they nevertheless dis- obeyed Him, it is obvious that He was not omnipotent. If, on the other hand, it was His will that they should disobey and turn away from him, then there is a patent contra- diction between His command and His will.129 126 The conception of creatio ex nihilo is here attacked. The advocates of Zoroastrianism believed in two eternal material elements, in eternal light and eternal darkness. See Grundriss, III, 668. 127 This question was already dealt with in the apocryphic and hel- lenistic literature. According to the Book of Jubilees God created light on the first day of creation, II, 2. Philo came to the conclusion that time is more recent than the world. He writes: "It is quite foolish to think that the world was created in six days or in space of time at all. Why? Because every period of time is a series of days and nights, and these can only be made such by the movement of the sun as it goes over and under the earth, but the sun is a part of heaven, so that time is confessedly more recent than the world." (Legum allegoria, I, 2 ff.). The Gnostics also pointed to this inconsistency in the story of Crea- tion. Cf. Origen, Contra Celsum, VI, 60. The point of view of the Haggada was that the sun and celestial spheres were created on the first day. Cf. Hag. 12a: irn ti7 I1WKin D1' m 11= nriKmn In In K lrn vwinc, -1'TY 1:DirOrlp.

Did not God foresee that Adam would be expelled from it?130 8) For what purpose did God create the tree of knowl- edge if he forbade Adam and Eve to eat of its fruit? It is evident from God's injunction and command not to eat of the tree of knowledge that he wanted men to remain ignorant and that ignorance was desired by Him more then knowledge and wisdom.131 9) It is evident that God is not omniscient because when he came to the Garden of Eden he raised his voice and asked Adam: "Where are you?" God apparently did not know where Adam was.'32 10) Similarly, from the fact that despite His threat, Adam and Eve ate of the tree and not only did not die but became more intelligent than before and were better able free will. (Antiquities of the Jews, 18, 1.3). The contradiction between foreknowledge and free will was already pointed out by Marcion. See Tertullian, C. Marcionem, II 5 ff.; Harnack, op. cit. 97-98. Cf. Fur- ther, P. Alfaric, op. cit. II, 143, where it is related that the Manichaean Addas, a pupil of Mani, made the same charges against God. Peter in the Clementine Homilies defends the free will of man against Simon Magus. (Clementine Homilies, XX, 3). 130 Perhaps that is one of the reasons why Philo did not take the paradise story literally, but explained it allegorically. See Legum allegoria, I, 28-30; de Plantatione Noe 8; for the allegorical explanation of the paradise story in later literature, see Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, V, 91, n. 50. '3' The Gnostics attacked the prohibition of eating of the tree of knowledge, proving from it the jealousy of God. See Origen, C. Celsum, IV, 40. Irenaeus, C. Haereses, III, 23.6; Clementine Homilies, III, 39. Hiwi al-Balkhi repeated the charges of the Gnostics. See note 52. The Haggadah maintained that before the fall, divine wisdom was bestowed upon Adam of which God deprived him afterwards. The forbidden fruit gave him human knowledge, but he was deprived of true knowl- edge and Godlike wisdom because of it. Ginzberg, op. cit. V, 118. Cf. Yalkut Shimeoni, I, 34: mnnu I-Inno rr TKu 1n. Death is, according to this Midrash, not a result of the fall. 132 The same charge was made by Marcion, see Terutllian, C. Mar- cionem, IV, 20; Cf. Harnack, op. cit. 93 f. The Manichaeans also charged the biblical God with ignorance, Alfaric, op. cit. II, 142.

He assails the anthropomorphisms in the Bible and cites in evidence a number of passages. God is full of vengeance, wrath and anger. He is without compassion and is cruel.'34 He killed hundreds of thousands of men in one night.135 He changes His mind and repents.'36 These charges are based on pas- sages from the Bible and on talmudic legends.137 I33 Many reasons are given in rabbinic, and also in patristic litera- ture, why Adam did not die on the day he sinned, as God had threat- ened. See Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, V, 98, n. 72. From Gen. r. s. 1. it is evident that the rabbis emphasized the end of verse Gen. 2-17: ninn nilt and not the beginning: lI:D rnil z. Cf.

See Julian the Apostate, op. cit. 161A (Loeb Classical Library, III, 364). 136 This charge could also be based on the ten changes enumerated by Saadia in his Emunot at the end of the third chapter (Emunot, ed. Slutzki, 69-70). The following may be added: It is forbidden, accord- ing to the Law, to make images, but God Himself told Moses to erect the brass serpent (Cf. M.R.H, 3.8; Sapientia Solomonis, 16.7). God commanded through Moses that sacrifices be brought to Him, but He later expressed through the prophets His dissatisfaction with sacri- fices. Shikand Gumanik Vijar, Chp. XIV, 32-33. This charge is based mainly on Gen. 6.6; I Sam. 15.11 and on the story of Jonah. In the time of Philo people made the same charges. Philo wrote a special treatise Quod deus sit immutabilis, in order to prove that God does not change his mind. Cf. ibid. 21. The same charge was repeated by Marcion, Celsus and others.

They can be traced to the works of Marcion,'38 Celsus,139 Porphyry,140 Mani,141 Julian the Apostate,142 and to the arguments of Simon Magus as reported in the Clementine Homilies.143 As a Zoroastrian source, the argument of light plays an important role in this controversy. Martan Faruk must have been a man of remarkable erudition. He was well acquainted with many portions of the Bible and with the apocryphal, pseudepigraphic and haggadic literature.144 Many problems pertaining to the sources from which he drew his information are still unsolved.145 He probably drew his knowledge of the Bible Taanit of the Babylonian Talmud Critically Edited... by Henry Malter (New York, 1930), p. 111.

The work of Martan Faruk could have been known to Hiwi in Balkh, which was the seat of radical Manichaean sects. ISLAMIC ATHEISTS Other heretic influences must receive consideration, since the Near East of the eighth and ninth centuries teemed with various Islamic heretics called Zindiqs. Islamic heretics of the ninth century drew their argu- ments from Zoroastrian sources. The radical sectarians of Islam in the first centuries of its existence, such as the Carmatians, Ismailiya and others, were Zoroastrians in disguise, who wanted to undermine Islam through Zoroas- trian ideas.I49 The famous legend of the three impostors, 146 According to Maimonides the Bible was translated into Persian hundreds of years before Mohammed.

He says: "It is clear that reason is the greatest gift of God to his creatures. The miracles of the prophets including those of Muhammad were de- ceptions. There are mainy kinds of deception: among them are such which it is difficult to recognize as deceptions. The prophets were only magicians."I64 An Arabic author of the twelfth century, Ibn al-Djawzi, relates that Ravendi did not believe in creation ex nihilo and that he wrote a book on the eternity of matter. Incidentally, al-Djawzi states that the father of Ravendi was a Jewish heretic. According to al-Djawzi, the Jews warned the Muslims in the following words: "Ravendi will corrupt your Scriptures as his father corrupted our Torah. His father taught that there were no prophets besides Moses."i6S it was only a vision. See Maimonides, loc. cit. Cf. Ginzberg, op. cit. VI, 356. I63 Salman ben Yeruham, a Karaite contemporary of Saadia Gaon mentions Rawendi and his influence in Jewish spheres.

The Christian Gnostics of the Near East, the Manichaeans, inherited the older polemical literature against Judaism and the Old Testament and made use of it in their disputa- tions with Jews. None of the attacks and arguments against the Old Testament since the early Hellenistic times was forgotten or lost. The Bible criticism of the Jewish Hellen- ists of the time of Philo of Alexandria'66 and the radical polemics of Marcion, Celsus, Porphyry, Mani, Julian the Apostate and others are repeated in literary documents of the eighth and ninth centuries. The works of Mani, the founder of the Manichaean sect, were translated into all Oriental languages.'67 His severe criticism of the Old Testa- ment was known to all dualists and heretics of the Near East.'68 Islamic heretic influences on Hiwi are therefore very probable.
