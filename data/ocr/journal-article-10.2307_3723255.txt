<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS The Broken Center. Studies in the Theological Horizon of Modern Literature. By NATHAN A. SCOTT, JR. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. I966. xviii + 237 pp. 37s. 6d. This book, which includes the William Lyon Phelps Lectures for I965, tackles once again the difficulties occasioned by the fact that 'the literature of our period is one passionately committed to its secularity' (p. 184); in seven substantial chapters the author examines some of the consequences of the 'despiritualization of modern life' as depicted in poems, novels, and dramas and tries to identify on his own terms the features which belong to what he calls the 'period-style' of the modern epoch. In addition, he attempts to throw further light on the nature of literary forms and genres by drawing out the theological implications which seem to derive from the examples he cites. As a starting-point he takes a passage from Conrad Aiken's Time in the Rock ('We need a theme? then let that be our theme . .. ') and then claims that it is the 'negatively theological character of modern literature that compels the critic to enter an essentially theological order of discourse and evaluation' (pp. ix-x). Not everyone, of course, will share Professor Scott's sense of compulsion in this matter, for many will deny the central importance of the theological horizon. Most readers, it seems to me, are more likely to feel that the approach here adopted is calculated tcb promote 'discourse' at the expense of evaluation as commonly understood. There can be no denying that the author's command of theological concepts is impressive: and his methods of presentation are subtly deployed. He moves easily among the theories propounded by such writers as Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Brunner, Buber, and Tillich, and handles large issues with considerable dexterity. Yet he is more adept at producing generalizations about groups of writers and 'strains of sensibility' than at formulating tangible judgements on particular works of literature. Thus we are met by such assertions as 'All the great charismatic seers of modern literature from Baudelaire to Kafka and from Pirandello to Faulkner, in one way or another, have wanted us to understand that we are lost in a dark wood and that, in this maze, what is least trustworthy is the common, the immediate, the familiar' (p. 21), or 'it is, indeed, in terms of the image of man amidst the dilapidation and ruins of modern existence that Hell is conceived in Pound's Hugh Selwyn Mauberley and Eliot's The Waste Land, in Ford's The Good Soldier and Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, in Faulkner's Sanctuary and Nathanael West's The Day of the Locust, in Cocteau's The Infernal Machine and Sartre's No Exit' (p. 8 i). The trouble with pronouncements like these is that they side-step specific comparison: they also suggest a somewhat specious kind of authority which is reinforced rather than counteracted by recourse to pretentious phraseology, as when we learn that the New Critics developed 'a view of the literary work as an autonomous system of verbal constructs among which there is an interaction so dynamic as to lure the reader out of the circumambient world into the "new" and autotelic world of the poem's unicity' (p. 35). Votaries of the New Theology may be in a position to take in their stride such formulations as 'a fundamental mistrust of the created orders of finitude' (p. 82) and 'the old anthropomorphic dilutions of Transcendence' (p. 173); to the uninitiated many of Scott's excogitations are intolerably obscure. It is, in fact, the absence of a convincing notation for the expression of a first-hand response to the literary experience as such which makes The Broken Center difficult to do justice to in these pages. Two chapters, 'The Crisis of Faith in the New Theology and the Promise of Grace in Poetic Art' and 'Faith and Art in a World Awry' do</page><page sequence="2">not do much, it seems to me, to enhance our interest in the poets and prose-writers quoted. In other parts of the book Scott does achieve a few telling characteriza- tions, as in his notes on Virginia Woolf and on Sartre's La Nausee which are well set out if not startlingly original. These, however, are merely arrived at enpassant. They occur in the chapter on 'The Bias of Comedy and the Escape into Narrow Faith', in which it is argued that the 'recoil into sensibility' is inimical to the comic spirit. From this Scott goes on to suggest that the comic catharsis- 'such a restoration of our confidence in the realm of finitude as enables us to see the daily occasions of our earth-bound career as being not irrelevant inconveniences but as possible roads into what is ultimately significant in life' (p. Io8) - is in harmony with the Christian view of things. The section on 'The Tragic Vision and the Christian Faith' similarly examines the manner in which 'the world of tragic experience' involves us ultimately in issues which have a demonstrably theological import. This, like the long excursus on 'Mimesis and Time in Modern Literature' is designed to support the contention that 'The very nature of literature ... is felt to require the critic finally to move beyond the level of purely verbal and stylistic analysis to the level of metaphysical and theological valuation' (p. I20). One would be happy to agree to the assumption of the responsibilities implied here if Professor Scott's own performance as a literary critic - I am not, of course, questioning the validity of his purely theological speculations - gave ground for confidence. Unfortunately it does not, except perhaps in the final chapter on 'Society and the Self in Recent American Literature' which has a vigour and immediacy not revealed elsewhere. E. D. MACKERNESS SHEFFIELD The English Language: Essays by English and American Men of Letters, I490-i839. Edited by W. F. BOLTON. London: Cambridge University Press. I966. xii + 228 pp. 30S. To the twenty essays collected here, Professor Bolton adds a four-page general introduction and an index of select topics: each essay is accompanied by a short summary and a set of questions for discussion. Since the collection is intended to furnish examples of 'the structure of the language and of attitudes toward it over some 300 years' it invites comparison with Miss S. I. Tucker's English Examined (1961) which shares the same objectives. The differences lie in the number and length of the extracts (Miss Tucker provides nearly three times as many, but they are very much shorter) and in the eminence of their authors: in English Examined many obscure and inaccessible works are represented, while the essays which Professor Bolton reprints (mostly in their entirety) are nearly all available in standard editions. They include works by Jonson, Hobbes, Dryden, Browne, Locke, Defoe, Addison, Swift, Chesterfield, Johnson, and Hazlitt; it is, of course, useful for the student to have them at hand in one volume. There is no question that the essays themselves are valuable in illustrating the development of ideas on language, and the only possible grounds for criticism are in the method of presentation and the choice of material. Although the collection is intended to illustrate the structure of the language at various periods, Professor Bolton gives little assistance to the student in acquiring any insight into that structure or into the linguistic context in which the essays were written, but tries to make the reader think for himself by providing questions which often need much research to be answered adequately. With such a difficult subject it is possible that the student will produce little more than random and unsystematic comment on both the language and the development of attitudes towards language Reviews 450</page></plain_text>
