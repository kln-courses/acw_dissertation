<plain_text><page sequence="1">Openings for Feminist Theorists and Theologians to Talk of the Divine: A Response to Zandra Wagoner Vaughan McTernan / Colorado College agoner takes significant steps toward creating an opening for VV feminist theorists and feminist theologians to talk about the divine. In her article, "Kinship Figures, Polluted Legacies, and Recycling," she builds a bridge to fruitfully bring together these two disciplines which often have opposing views about the importance of images of the divine. Wagoner suggests a provisional framework within which the two fields might engage in a conversation she views as beneficial to both. This nascent connection is built upon commonalities Wagoner sees between theologian Catherine Keller and feminist/scientist philosopher Donna Haraway. In particular she looks at possible directions for the reconstruction of the divine in the intersection of Keller's and Haraway's works. She combines their works using Haraway's images of kinship figures and companion species to reconstruct, or recycle, the divine in the fluid modes defined by Keller. As she juxtaposes feminist theory and feminist theology, Wagoner asserts that without addressing religion feminist theory cannot accomplish its goal of undoing the damage of religious ideology or, as Haraway puts it, of changing "the Sacred Image of the Same and the Edenic travelogue"1 that continue to be "barriers to human flourishing." For Wagoner, when feminists dismiss religion they collaborate in letting destructive metaphors and figures remain in place. Feminist theologians have for some time been appealing to feminist theorists, such as Luce Irigaray, Judith Butler, and Haraway, for ways to interpret the divine, thus already drawing on theorists in the reconstructive task despite their distance from religious discourse. Wagoner hopes to convince theorists this engagement is not only to their benefit, but necessary to their projects. Wagoner has productively explored the intersection of Keller's and Haraway's works. However, her analysis ought to be extended to address pressing questions about reconstructing the divine as a method 1 Donna Haraway, "Race: Universal Donors in a Vampire Culture.

Questions that emerge include who reconstructs images of the divine, in what way and how often, and what will define or indicate its reality. To begin, I will critique and extend Wagoner's premises for bringing together feminist theology and theory. As with most feminist theologians, her first two premises are, one, that models of divinity function powerfully within our culture whether we believe in them or not, and, second, that reconstructions of the divine are transformational and, therefore, disruptive of cultural biases. What I find problematic is her third premise that setting aside questions of truth while using recycled, disruptive images of the divine is necessary and even beneficial to the project. Therefore, asserts Wagoner, feminist theorists need not find the question of whether or not God exists a stumbling block to using such images of God. In choosing this methodology, Wagoner follows Catherine Keller's lead,2 and inherits her contradictions in assuming it is not necessary to worry about whether or not God is real and that this stance does not affect the potency of divine images. This approach is especially troubling because Keller and Haraway, the two major feminist scholars used by Wagoner, focus on the power of language and its material reality. Wagoner posits that Catherine Keller's recycling of the divine is commensurate with Donna Haraway's project of rewriting stories of dominant cultural figures such as the cyborg. In her rewriting, Haraway brings together kinship figures in a flexible, ongoing drama of interaction, much as Keller recycles models of the divine. Both Haraway and Keller are concerned with the depth and complexity of meaning making, of semiotics. This, at bottom, is why Wagoner is able to bring these two seemingly divergent authors together. As Wagoner points out in her article, Haraway's oft used term for depth and complexity is "tropic,"3 meaning numerous connections and built up meanings in the kinship groups she envisions. Keller's term for this depth of meaning is "tehomic"4 indicating the diversity and 2 See Keller's Apocalypse Now and Then ( Boston: Beacon Press, 1996) in which she takes this stance, presenting the immediate benefits to theoretical thought, but not dealing with long-term consequences regarding constructions of reality. 3 Donna Haraway, "Morphing in the Order: Flexible Strategies, Feminist Science Studies, and Primate Revisions," in The Haraway Reader, (New York: Routledge, 2004), 200-201. 4 Catherine Keller, Face of the Deep: A Theology of Becoming (New York:Routledge, 2003), 213-228.</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 28, No. 2, May 2007 273 interconnection of configurations of creation and the divine in Biblical and theological tradition. Tehomic refers to the constant remaking of creation out of chaos and the fundamental wildness of the recyclable parts of creation and God. The concepts of tehomic and tropic are the same in three particular ways: depth and reach of meaning, constant revision of meaning, and finally the extent of connection between unlikely as well as likely bedfellows making them kin. For both Keller and Haraway, but particularly for the latter, the depth of meaning making and its tropic extensions emphasizes the need to recognize and utilize all connections. Following this emphasis, and because she recognizes that divinity functions powerfully within culture, Wagoner extends kinship to include images of the divine. Wagoner sees clearly the similarities in complexity between the figure of the cyborg and the divine, and thus the necessity of utilizing the divine not only as one kinship figure among many, but as a cyborg-like composite of kin. The divine must be rewritten in this mode. For Wagoner, the importance of drawing on Keller in particular for this task of reconfiguration, is that she uses familiar, traditional images which she transforms into culturally coherent kinship figures by recycling them. Because we recognize them as tropes to which we are already inexorably tied, their new configurations become powerful disruptors of the same old story. Bringing these recycled, tehomic images into kinship groups is at the heart of Wagoner's project. Within this dual feminist context, however, important questions for Wagoner's project are: how can this proposed kinship with the divine best be utilized, how can it constitute a kinship with depth not just utility, and how can it be viewed as non-hegemonic? As a biologist, Haraway uses scientific metaphors to make her points. Her discussion of a microbe, the mixotricha paradoxa,5 an organelle found in an Australian termite, clarifies the meaning of kinship subjects as they might apply to the divine. The microbe is as integrated in the termite as any regular cells in the termite's body. As Haraway observes, it is absurd to try and determine where it stops and the termite begins.6 But the point is not so much that they co-constitute each other as that the story of their kinship is a different one than we usually hear in the Christian West. In Haraway's words it makes "a 5 Donna Haraway, "Otherworldly Conversations; Terran Topics; Local Terms," in The Haraway Reader, (New York: Routledge, 2004), 147 6 Ibid., 146.</page><page sequence="4">274 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy mockery of the notion of the bounded, defended singular self "7 This story gives us a new definition of kinship including with what we are kin, which for Wagoner, can incorporate how we are related to the divine. For Haraway, genetic recombination, as in the termite, is a model for kinship in which every kind of technology and bio-diversity is at play. She calls this play, "narrative morphings with material semiotic consequences."8 What I understand her to be saying is that kinship figures, like words, have semiotic power to make meaning that is real.9 In this vein, Wagoner asserts that for Haraway and Keller, metaphor is always fleshy. As they reach for complex meanings, their words are always both metaphor and material. Like words, Haraway's cyborg figure is also both metaphor and fleshy. The cyborg is a liminal kinship figure traversing both domains. It is weighted with complex, tropic meaning that makes it real, fleshy metaphor. How, then, in the struggle to make the divine less of a stumbling block to feminist theory, can divinity as kinship figure fit into this cyborg story to also become real and fleshy metaphor? Haraway's own religious background and use of language provide an answer. As Wagoner emphasizes, despite Haraway's firm entrenchment in feminist theory Haraway herself points to the strong connection between how she uses language and her religious sensibility. Her past experience of the presence of God still shapes her understanding of the power and tropic depth of language, and is reflected in the figures she creates through language.10 Her Catholicism and her theological training are, she says, deep in her bones.11 Further, Wagoner and others assert that Haraway's language and the figures she creates are profoundly religious. In this writer's view, the depth her language and figures evoke, the retellings they provoke, and the intensity of their materiality are rooted in the Word as the presence of God. Because of these evocations, God can be a liminal figure, both 7 Ibid. 8 Donna Haraway, "Cyborgs to Companion Species: Reconfiguring Kinship in Technoscience," in The Haraway Reader, (New York: Routledge, 2004), 308 9 Haraway, "Otherworldly Conversations; Terran Topics; Local Terms," 146. 10 Donna Haraway, How Like a Leaf: An Interview with Thyrza Nichols Goodeve (New York: Routledge, 2000), 85-86. 11 Donna Haraway, "Cyborgs, Coyotes, and Dogs: A Kinship of Feminist Figurations and There are Always More Things Going on Than You Thought!

Here, the issue of the truth of divine existence comes to the fore. We must ask if, for Wagoner, positing the divine as kinship figure is simply a utilitarian move for combining antagonistic disciplines in hopes of "changing the same old story"? Keller and Wagoner posit that whether or not God exists is not an issue in the reconstruction of God, and that the recycling/reconstruction process is much easier if questions of truth and reality are set aside. I agree that this is the case. However, more relevant questions and ones important to the nature of kinship are whether or not, and in what sense God is real. This includes asking how God or the divine functions as a liminal figure between metaphor and materiality. As a kinship figure, this is where divinity would hover in Haraway's schema. Wagoner, Keller, and Haraway herself seem to want, but are reluctant to actually develop, the figure of the divine in this liminal space. Perhaps this is because they are intent on keeping the question of the truth of God's existence out of the conversation. Wagoner wishes to add the divine to Haraway's grouping of kinship figures, but without understanding the divine in this context as much more than a "functional actant." While she recognizes Haraway's broad understanding of actant, she emphasizes the functional aspects of divine reconfiguration. It seems to me that this utilitarian view would not be good enough even for Haraway. Haraway claims to be neither a social constructionist nor a naturalist.121 do not think she would categorize the divine as either a social construction or a truth. The reality of divinity, when fleshed out in Haraway's understanding, however, can take on the metaphoric materiality of words. It can be more than utilitarian actant. The complexity of the figures Haraway creates, such as the cyborg, can only be revealed when they are seen to incorporate this metaphoric materiality. This is not to simplistically say they are "true," which, following Whitehead, Haraway calls "misplaced concreteness."13 However, for Haraway the figures she creates are definitely "real," and by real she means that the cyborg, for example, has a depth of reality that is more potent than merely "true" precisely because it has the advantage of being both material and metaphor. Or in similar terms also used by Haraway, it is real by virtue of being an 12 Ibid., 330. 13 Ibid.</page><page sequence="6">276 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy "interface" of nature and culture. Haraway wishes to "write a different kind of history," one that seizes on the rich depths and tropic intensity of kinship reality and that is, "a serious historical effort to get elsewhere."15 Like Keller she sees the opportunity for "tehomic" materiality. Not surprisingly, a powerful, intense figure of divinity that is disruptive of the same old stories develops in this tropic space. Both Keller and Haraway recognize the unnameableness of the divine and the negative tradition that is, in Harway's words, "about the reality of infinity, about the truth of limitlessness, which, as I see it, is existent."16 In this writer's view, then, to posit the divine as a "real" existent kinship figure rather than merely utilitarian device would be to open up the unnameable divine to the tropic richness, the ambiguity, the dynamic reach and reconfiguration of the space, or perhaps it should be called history, between metaphor and materiality. This is what will change the stories and benefit Wagoner's project. Another issue to consider as Wagoner bridges feminist theology and theory through divine kinship is the kinship dynamic. When Haraway discusses companion species, a broader but similar term to kinship,17 she says they include, "machines, molecules, scientists, hunter-gatherers, garbage dumps, puppies, fox farmers, and randy bitches of all breeds, genders, and species."18 There is no reason not to include God or the divine in this litany. Once we include the divine as a kinship figure, we have to look closely to see how puppies are as powerful a disrupter as God. But this is precisely how Haraway and, I think, other feminist theorists would have it. When, for example, Haraway writes about the domestication of dogs from a non anthropomorphic view, she shows that dogs are just as likely to have co-opted humans to ensure the dogs' survival as people are to have been the ones to domesticate the dogs.19 In this case the kinship figure of the dog disrupts the same old story. In her book Primate Visions: Gender Race and Nature in the World of Modern Science,20 Haraway disrupts Western interpretations of primate behavior, and thus 14 Ibid., 332. 15 Ibid., 330. 16 Ibid., 334. 17 Haraway, "Cyborgs to Companion Species," 300. 18 Ibid., 307. 19 Ibid., 305-7. 20 Donna Haraway, Primate Visions: Gender, Race and Nature in the World of Modern Science (New York: Routledge, 1990).</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 28, No. 2, May 2007 277 interpretations of ourselves, by documenting radically contradictory interpretations of the apes' behavior by people from various non-Anglo cultures. As these interpretations show, taking the views of various kinship figures is part of what changes the stories. Important to Wagoner's project, then, is to have the divine be one figure that brings in deep, rich tropes, but to also see other figures, such as puppies, bearing equally potent tropes. This is not easy to see for those whose operative cultural story begins with creatio ex nihilo. It is also not easy to see for feminist theorists who have found images of the divine powerfully destructive, and who struggle to believe that destructive divine images can be mitigated by devices such as kinship tropes. Perhaps that is why they choose to leave religious images out altogether. This resistance is one of the barriers Wagoner must overcome if her project is to succeed. While I support Wagoner's overall project to make it possible for feminist theorists to incorporate ideas of the divine, I maintain that her project must include the prospect that the divine will be a "real" liminal figure, both metaphor and material. The divine will carry presence and efficacy in the same way that words do for both Harraway and Keller. It will not simply be functional. I also maintain that Wagoner's project must remain open to the possibility that a recycled, transformed divinity will be only one among various tropes that can contribute depth and complexity to the kinship group. This new image of the divine along with recycling will make sure the story keeps getting refigured. Wagoner's project is an important step in transfiguring the divine and thus the content and structure of our stories. As Harraway writes, "We might learn to live without the bracing discourse of salvation history. We exist in a sea of powerful stories: They are the condition of finite rationality and personal and collective life histories. There is no way out of stories; but no matter what the One-Eyed Father says, there are many possible structures, not to mention contents, of narration. Changing the stories in both material and semiotic senses, is a modest intervention worth making."21 21 Donna Haraway, "Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium,,, in The Haraway Reader, (NY: Routledge 2004), 246.</page></plain_text>
