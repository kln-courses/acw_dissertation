<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hewitt, Winston R. Through Those Living Pillars. Man and Nature in the Works of Emile Zola. The Hague-Paris: Mouton, 1974. De Proprietatibus Litterarum, Series Practica, 75. 158 pp. Periodically Zola critics turn their attention away from the novelist's social and political dramas, from his urban and industrial epics, to rediscover in certain of his works a kind of poetry rooted in the Rousseauist tradition of the adoration of nature. Professor Hewitt's interesting study could have been written, for example, under the patronage of the group of writers, the naturistes , who at the turn of the century extolled that aspect of his work. "Je touche là," writes one of them, Saint-Georges de Bouhélier, in L'Hiver en méditation , "à la grande découverte de Zola: ne point séparer l'homme de la nature."</page><page sequence="2">532 Nineteenth-Century French Studies By the problematic term "nature" is meant primitive nature, as is the case throughout Professor Hewitt's book, except in chapter one, a somewhat oblique study of Zola's "view of nature" through some of his critical judg- ments, where the novelist's more liberal use of the term leads to some con- fusion. The following three chapters present numerous examples, usually taken from the earlier works, of characters escaping or longing to escape from a "venal" urban setting to "pure" natural surroundings which revitalize, console and most commonly, uplift their moods and spirits. More detailed categories are used in the two longer chapters that follow. Chapter v in- troduces cases of anthropomorphism which relate man erotically to nature or provide intimate settings conducive to love, arranged in subsections ac- cording to the predominant sense that is evident in such scenes. Here, as elsewhere, there are interesting pages on the role of the elements in certain works, which however would have benefited from the profounder insights of a Bachelard. The author has a special eye for situations in which a sexualized natural phenomenon interrelates with a character of the opposite sex, though a rigid attention to gender leads to some unconvincing inter- pretations. Is the sap rising in the revitalized Pascal, for example, really a feminine force because the French word is "la sève" (p. 84)? Chapter vi provides instances of pathetic fallacy in various guises (sympathetic, apathetic, prophetic, benevolent). At times the range of examples strains the neat scheme, particularly in the section entitled "Benevolent Fallacy and the Chain of Being" where the presentation of Zola's pantheism and of his cyclical vision demonstrates, not the attribution of human qualities to nature, but the belief that man should submit to nature's regenerative teleology. Such a taxonomy of episodes involving man's intimate links with nature occupies most of this book. Yet there are brief passages and a short chapter (vii) which relate these incidents to more general and, perhaps for some readers, alarmingly diverse principles of interpretation. Discreetly, indeed largely through the use of epigraphs, they are ascribed to the legacy of a tradition, making of Zola, at least in this respect, "more a late-born literary progeny of the romantics than a member of the second generation of the realists" (p. 143). Then these effects are explained in Zola's own terms, as a product of a subjective vision, of the writer's temperament, distorting the transparent representation of reality. But the principle interpretative resource is Freudian, ascribing such episodes (again rather tentatively, as the critic hesitates between explanation and analogy) to a desire for fetal security, to a death wish, or to both combined. Psychoanalytical approaches to literature, it could be said, range between two extreme tendencies: the rigorously elaborated theories and methods of, say, Charles Mauron and the casual practices of what Norman Holland has dubbed (in the Hudson Review , 1962) the "here-a-phallic-symbol-there-a-phallic-symbol school." Professor Hewitt spares us the phallic symbols and it would be unjust to reduce his method to the second tendency, but it is far removed from the first. It is not even clear, for example, whose psyche is under investigation: the characters', Zola's, or, more generally, man's. Furthermore, does the occasional presence of possible fetal postures and death wishes really explain, let alone justify, the claim</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 533 that the novelist's "romantic subjective imagery transcends that of the romantics and the realists' objective externality, in that it announces re- soundingly the advent of Freudian psychology" (p. 145)? One could find fault with a few points of detail (the verb "possesser," p. 81; the dating of "Le [sic] Printemps - journal d'un convalescent"), not least of which the appropriateness of the title of this study. A "correspon- dance" is thereby established between Baudelaire's sonnet and the themes of this book, which requires more ample explanation than the mere quotation of the first quatrain of the poem (p. 145). But, however critical he might be of the theoretical vagueness in this study, the reader will find in it a welcome focusing on the naturiste themes of Zola's works, which represent, not only a vicarious refuge from harsh social reality, but the novelist's closest ap- proach to a sense of spirituality, countervailing his "scientific," determinisi beliefs and practices. In the final analysis, it is doubtless the latter rather than the former that invites the analogy with the enterprise of Freud, who considered himself, after Copernicus and Darwin, to have dealt a third resounding blow to man's anthropocentrism.
