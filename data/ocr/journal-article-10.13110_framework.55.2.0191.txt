Also in narrative  fiction films revolving around the lives and labors of the movie industry—in  Hollywood, in Cinecittà—the situation of the screen test recurs.

In post-classical cinema, especially, such scenes erupt. Almost  invariably they tell of crisis and failure, bespeaking the cinema’s heightened  self-consciousness upon the decline of the studio system, the decomposition of  genres and rupture of formal boundaries, and the aging and death of stars. Th e  films with which I am concerned thematize these symptoms to reflect on the  historical condition of the cinema, to foreground an existential confrontation  with mass culture in late modernity. Th e encounter of the human subject with  the apparatus—the technology, the studio, the industry—is dramatized and  intensified, and yet the screen test oft en remains unresolved in these films: Th e  question of the contender “passing” or “failing” the test, of a role being won  or lost, is suspended or displaced onto diff erent spheres of social being and of  consciousness. Th e irresolution of the screen test radicalizes it as form and as  idea. It blurs distinctions of “subject,” “actor,” “character,” and “role,” heightening  anxieties about human agency in late modernity. It has thus prompted my return  to the somewhat antiquated notion of the “person” in these pages. With few exceptions, little attention has been accorded to the workings of the  screen test as form and as trope.1 Surely its most stunning artistic appropriation  to stage the confrontation of person and apparatus has been achieved by Andy  Warhol: His Screen Tests (US, 1964–66) have deservedly garnered the most  attention and have not been in the least exhausted by it. What powers did Warhol  locate in the screen test’s laying bare of the apparatus—from technology to visual- ity, from market to human conditions? How did he devise the confrontational  fiction of the screen test as an existential predicament in which “being” is staged  and its performance is put to the test? How did it mediate Warhol’s incredible  recovery of the portrait in the the history of art, confirming the moving image as a  veritable “art of the person”? Elsewhere I pursue these issues as part of a study of the  human face in the cinema.2 I will here direct these questions toward another work,  contemporary with Warhol’s project: a minor film of a major auteur. Dubbed  Il provino/Th e Screen Test, it is Michelangelo Antonioni’s mostly neglected  Prefazione, the Preface to Dino De Laurentiis’s tri-part omnibus production, I  tre volti/Th ree Faces of a Woman (IT, 1965).3 Il provino revolves around the screen  test of a woman already singled out as a celebrity and seeking, possibly, to give  some substance and meaning to her public image—and perhaps to remake her  life—through movie acting (see figure 1). Antonioni parses the material, formal,  and psychic coordinates intersecting in the situation of the screen test, seeing them  accumulate and intensify but never resolved. Drawing on the actual conditions  of De Laurentiis’s production, navigating reenactment and fiction, Il provino will  192 </page> <page sequence="3"> Pass/Fail Figure 1. Michelangelo Antonioni, Prefazione/Il provino (1965). not give birth to a star. Staging (or in a way, witnessing) the making and unmaking  of its human subject who struggles to articulate a screen persona, it lays bare the  inadequacy of the screen test to the person. One senses here Antonioni’s own  struggle to remold an exceptionally luxurious but fragile creature—Princess  Soraya, a world-class celebrity—that has been off ered to him pre-packaged, her- metically sealed, by the production. Probing his beautiful protagonist’s reserve and  her fallibility allows him to bracket the screen test’s conclusion and, ultimately, to  reflect on cinematic mediation as a mediation of being. Many of Antonioni’s films engage with a search for the person, for someone  ostensibly lost (L’avventura, IT/FR, 1960; Identification of a Woman, IT/FR,  1982) or lost to oneself (Il grido, IT/US, 1956) or in loss of self (Th e Passenger, IT/ ES/FR, 1974). Of course, these varieties are oft en enfolded one within the other.  All these films trace the displacement and dissolution of a character, the failure to  unify and sustain it, the confluence of the searcher and the missing or lost person,  and some recognition that follows in its wake. Il provino does not need to venture  far and wide, to traverse cities, regions, and continents for this purpose. It stays in  the movie studio, pursuing its elusive protagonist within that artificial environ- ment that serves as actual location. Unlike Antonioni’s modernist cinematic  monuments, however, this short film confounds us in its “docu-drama” mode.  Fiction and actuality, action and reenactment, person and role are compressed in  Antonioni’s use of the screen test. In its most compelling instances, distinctions  dissolve and odd hybrids emerge to meet a resistant human subject. 193 </page> <page sequence="4"> Noa Steimatsky Figure 2. Antonioni, Attempted Suicide (1953). Th e closest precedent in Antonioni’s filmography to the hybridity of Il  provino as a working mode must be the short Attempted Suicide (IT, 1953), his  contribution to the 1953 anthology film Love in the City. Cesare Zavattini’s “movie  magazine” comprises a cluster of investigations on modern love. Radicalizing  the terms of encounter prompted by a particularly challenging choice of topic— women who have attempted suicide and returned from the dead (as it were) to  confront, on film, their moment of crisis—Antonioni’s cinematic compression of  telling and showing, present and past, turned the tables on the neorealist ideal of  the non-actor who draws on her real-life role. Th e several sequences devoted to the  women’s narratives, recollected and reenacted mostly on location, are enframed  by connective passages that are expressively lit, elaborately blocked and paced,  and set against a blank studio backdrop propped up within a large soundstage  (see figure 2). With its abject theme, its mostly lower-class protagonists, and its use of  black and white, Attempted Suicide might first appear quite distant from the  glamorous Technicolor world of Il provino. And yet both works, drawing their  stories from the local news and sensational press, revolve around existential tests  of sorts, moments of encounter elicited by and for the camera, so that the very  194 </page> <page sequence="5"> Pass/Fail site of filmmaking unfolds as a space of transition between biographical-historical  experience and its emphatically constructed and cinematized corollary. From  diff erent ends of the social scale, both the neorealist types in Attempted Suicide  and the aristocratic tabloid celebrity of Il provino are, essentially, non-actors.  Indeed, the intermittent eff orts of performance required of them appears, at  times, to interfere with what they really off er as non-actors. Antonioni seems  not only aware of this but, in fact, very much interested in just such interference  as a way of probing his subjects. We shall see how Soraya’s celebrity complicates  this precarious navigation of categories and, augmenting its attendant anxieties,  yields a particularly unstable work. Oddly, Attempted Suicide—with its multiple  protagonists, each accorded a brief narrative fragment that joins the most trau- matic instance of the women’s experience with prosaic, everyday detail—seems  more securely composed by comparison. Antonioni’s intricate layering of  first-person confession of memory; second-person interviews (rehearsed and  staged); and authoritative, opinionated third-person voice-over narration in  Attempted Suicide confounds any clear distinction between modes of address,  any simple linear threading of past and present, narration and action, studio and  location. Th e Zavattinian “film inquest” unfolds here not only as social panorama  but, as Ivone Margulies astutely observed, as a therapeutic occasion for personal  self-realization—and as an exemplum.4 In a climactic moment, a young woman  reenacts the string of quotidian activities leading to the slitting of her wrists: She  goes through the motions but interrupts them when the blade touches her scar.  In place of re-cutting, the blade now points to—it indexes—the indelible trace  of an action past. And as the monstrative cinematic present meets this emissary  of the past, the film’s mode of address shift s with the girl’s extending of her wrist  directly to the camera. She then goes on to confess that what she really wants is  to become an actress. So does Princess Soraya. Former empress-wife of the Shah of Iran, Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari was  banished in 1958 for her failure to produce an heir, then roamed in the European  jet set, which landed her in one of its preferred playgrounds: Rome. Here her  celebrity, but also her great beauty and graceful deportment, brought her to  the front doors of cinema. Carlo di Carlo, Antonioni’s close collaborator and  archivist, tells that Antonioni’s contribution to I tre volti was by the suggestion  of Franco Indovina, Antonioni’s close friend and assistant on the great black-and- white features of the early 1960s.5 Indovina was romantically involved with Soraya,  who was to star in the three episodes of Dino De Laurentiis’s omnibus production,  devoted to building her screen persona. Antonioni insisted on placing and desig- nating his contribution as “Preface” or “Introduction.” Although it occupies, at  about 35 minutes, roughly equal length as the other episodes, the Prefazione—by  195 </page> <page sequence="6"> Noa Steimatsky its title and by other distancing devices—thus situates itself in a threshold position  that it exploits for what one might read as an extra- or pre-narrative function.  Th is aff ords Antonioni a freedom of form, a reflexive disposition to be gained  from being both within and outside the structure in this eclectic work. Possibly  it signals, as well, Antonioni’s ironic, even non-committal attitude towards the  enterprise as a whole: He might have recognized early on that Soraya could have  no future on the screen but, having committed to the project, he thematized this  recognition in the inconclusive screen test. Th e Preface thus introduces Soraya into  the world of cinema for the first time, even as it prefigures her failure. What is Antonioni’s particular interest (or, one might ask, what is his share)  in this story of failure? His one brief statement on the film in the course of produc- tion presented it as an experiment in color, to extend his work on Red Desert (IT/ FR, 1964) while already preparing for a subsequent film “still without a title” that,  he added, would be “very violent.” Possibly he was referring here not to Blow-Up  (UK/IT/US, 1966), but to Tecnicamente dolce/Technically [or Technologically]  Sweet—an unrealized project involving video color experiments, for which he  prepared a treatment in 1966.6 Il provino is nested in Antonioni’s most creative  period. It can be associated not only with a period of transition with the shift  to  color and internationalization of his work in the mid 1960s, but also with the  “auteur super spectacles” of the Italian new wave epitomized by Fellini’s La dolce  vita (IT/FR, 1960) and 81⁄2 (IT/FR, 1963)—both of which are clearly echoed in  Il provino. All these films exhibited ways in which ambitious auteurist endeavors  might also satisfy the box office, and they endowed Italian film culture, for the  second time in its postwar history, with unsurpassed international prestige.  Th e stylistic allure and commercial appeal of these films were integral to their  bold exploration of how cinematic narration and form might dissolve in the  emphatically contemporary locations—how the struggle to grasp and failure to  hold together their meandering protagonists in a late-modern universe of glossy  surfaces and media events can give rise to exciting cinematic spectacle. Antonioni’s  move to color in that period altered the encounter, on film, between manufactured  objects, natural forms, and formlessness, between figure and setting. Th e dusty  black-and-white world of neorealism now dropped even further into the past,  along with the 1930s classical cinema’s nuanced shadings and the wrought glamour  of stars. Red Desert achieves its beauty quite diff erently: it pulses with the meeting  and the separateness of bodies, densities of fog, and with the marvels of industrial  design, which invigorated Antonioni’s work with new graphic and chromatic  possibilities. Th us when Monica Vitti emerged in her green wool coat—a green  so indescribably exquisite as to break with both natural vegetation and with the  primary industrial palette—into the polluted landscape, person and coat could  speak or, by fantastic counterpoint to the setting, they could sing together. Can  196 </page> <page sequence="7"> Pass/Fail the elements be welded here, in the short (but by no means unambitious) film  with which we are concerned, quite so eloquently? Antonioni never discussed Il  provino further. Th at something about it remained, perhaps, unresolved for him  coincided with the fate of I tre volti as a whole: Aft er its considerable anticipa- tion—itself prefigured in the film—it was largely dismissed by the critics, then  shelved in the vaults of the De Laurentiis establishment, which, to date, would  not release it in whole or part. It sunk into oblivion. Il provino is firmly located as part of an anthology, or “omnibus” project, a  production and distribution format quite popular in that era—oft en the result of  European co-productions that packaged a cluster of shorts around a theme, a place,  or, as is the case here, a particular performer. Th e short format allowed a degree of  liberty, a special space for play, which was creatively and successfully used in only a  handful of cases; those by the known auteurs survived in film histories. Love in the  City and its contemporary Siamo Donne (IT, 1953) are well-known early examples;  in the mid 1960s we find some of the same contributors from the credits of I tre volti  in such anthologies as Le Plus vieux métier du monde/Th e Oldest Profession (FR/ DE/IT), and Le streghe/Th e Witches (IT/FR), both misogynist titles of 1967. Like I  tre volti, Le streghe was a Dino De Laurentiis production whose episodes were each  assigned to a diff erent director but were connected through a flexible theme and  through a female star—or, in Soraya’s case, a would-be star. In Le streghe, Silvana  Mangano, De Laurentiis’s wife (whose immaculate beauty bears comparison to  the princess’s), sustains a great range. It is just this capacity that Pier Paolo Pasolini  must have recognized, first when he used her in his own exquisite contribution  to Le streghe, La terra vista dalla luna/Th e Earth as Seen fr om the Moon, and then  in vastly diff erent roles such as the industrialist’s wife in Teorema (IT, 1968) and  Jocasta in his Oedipus Rex (IT/MA, 1967). Visconti’s episode, La strega bruciata  viva/Th e Witch Burnt Alive, has itself been compared to Il provino because both  center around the figure of the jet-setting, luxuriously garbed and groomed, but  deeply alienated celebrity whose cool beauty seldom betrays any glimpse of her  underlying vulnerability and isolation.7 All episodes of I tre volti revolve around a similar theme. Antonioni’s Preface  is followed by Mauro Bolognini’s Amanti celebri/Celebrity Lovers, co-starring  Richard Harris, fresh from his role in Red Desert and sporting a beard (perhaps  carried over from his contemporary role in another De Laurentiis production,  John Huston’s Th e Bible [US/IT, 1966]). Here he is a best-selling author and  lover but somehow failed as a man—a predicament that vaguely echoes that of  Antonioni’s male protagonists in L’avventura and especially La notte (IT/FR, 1961).  In Bolognini’s episode, it is by a sort of detour through Soraya’s perception, and her  ennui (not realized in any compelling way, however) that he seems to recognize  his shortcomings while she, too, remains dejected. Th e third episode, Franco  197 </page> <page sequence="8"> Noa Steimatsky Indovina’s Latin Lover, tells of dissolution, splitting, failure, and recognition—all  elements prefigured in the Preface, but here presented in comedic mode. Soraya  plays an American woman on a business visit to Rome, where she is pestered by a  ridiculous, marvelous Alberto Sordi, who she first haughtily dismisses and then  graciously acknowledges in a gesture that secures his gigolo career. Surpassing the  sham and swindle, a glimpse of some deeper sympathy is aff orded the quasi-couple  in this quasi-comedy. Antonioni’s episode underscores the sense of exteriority and impenetrability  in the encounter with Soraya, using the screen test situation to challenge it head  on. Of course, Antonioni routinely avoids conventional cinematic mechanisms  of identification, diff using psychology or motivation in tracing his protagonists’  encounters and responses. His best work relies, instead, on a heightening of  perceptual experience filtered, most eloquently, through his female protagonists.  But Soraya filters very little: she resists; the sparse narrative does not evolve nor is  it, in Antonioni fashion, diff used through her. All expression seems to bounce off   her features and rebound back onto a world of surfaces. Her reserve is thus quite  consistent across the diff erent episodes. And yet I tre volti was to off er a third  face, so to speak, to a woman who had already carried at least two public faces in  coherent lineage: first as the Shah’s consort and second as the banished princess,  with her famously sad eyes oft en concealed behind dark glasses as she circulated  through the tabloids. Th e third face is that of a woman in search of a role. I tre  volti as a whole seems, in this light, to be an extended screen test for Soraya: a  rather extravagant one that she ultimately fails. Il provino narrates this directly,  exposing its underlying structure and its medium consciousness while exploring  the existential predicament of the woman caught within. Th is predicament is  not rendered as introspection on the part of a character, but as imbricated in the  very situation of filmmaking, intensified in the screen test, and formalized in  Antonioni’s direction of the action, its framing, its mise-en-scène. He foregrounds  the analytic, quasi-scientific process by which the test unfolds, also begging the  question of what the test is for and how it circles back upon itself. What can the  apparatus elicit from the person? Does it hold her together or take her apart?  Either way, does she survive, or become an empty shell, a relic of Antonioni’s  probing? What are the fictions that sustain the subject when confronted with the  machinations of the cinema where, as Stanley Cavell put it, she is “the subject of  study, and a study not [her] own.”8 Th e clinical, technological screen-test procedure bears upon the contending  actor—upon the person undertaking it. Th e stage is set in enticing ways for Soraya’s  first emergence on the screen. Th e aggressive devices and rhetoric of the press, the  flashing violence of the media, and the forces of big movie business invested in  the enterprise all assert themselves immediately in the late-modern settings of  198 </page> <page sequence="9"> Pass/Fail Figure 3. Antonioni, Il provino: Soraya’s face assessed for the camera. Il provino. We first move through the nondescript, somewhat shabby offices of  Paese sera, the Roman daily, where a reporter receives rumor of Princess Soraya’s  imminent screen test for De Laurentiis. What follows is a burst of sleek, almost  abstract nighttime space where the planetary constellation of moviemaking is  located: executives, guards, technicians, craft smen, and stylists all form a cohesive  structure elucidated in Antonioni’s orchestration of the various parts of the studio  and its functions. One is first stunned by the extraordinary neon lights that mark  the driveway towards a glass-encased lobby; even more than the EUR residences  of L’eclisse (IT, 1962), these invoke an Alphaville or a Tati-ville or a Dan Flavin  installation. A sense of spatial dissolution or dislocation, at once threatening and  compelling, impinges upon these actual locations. Strange animal cries—perhaps  the trumpeting of elephants or the call of large birds—pierce the darkness. Th e  paparazzi reassure each other that it is only the zoo assembled for production of  John Huston’s Th e Bible on these grounds. We are, then, in the newly built Dino  De Laurantiis studio complex on the via Pontina, southwest of Rome. This exposition serves to approach Soraya with deliberate delays and  obstructions: as a personage who is in fact unapproachable, a precious museum  object. Behind closed and guarded doors, a miniature, hermetic world is awake  and revolving around her. Business, technology, and the various arts and services  of moviemaking are represented, more or less individualized through some  recognizable crew members ostensibly reenacting here their own “life roles.” Piero  Tosi—the great costume designer—is among them. De Laurentiis himself appears  199 </page> <page sequence="10"> Noa Steimatsky both in name and in person, though he remains faceless, deliberately turned  away or otherwise concealed from Antonioni’s camera. Th e baring of Soraya’s  face stands out by contrast: front and center, her face is isolated against a black  backdrop, with her hair and torso covered in black so that the face is almost like a  mask hovering in space or a moon against a starless night sky. Half the face is then  concealed by a black screen that slices it right down the middle and is, in turn,  moved laterally across her immobile face to expose the other half (see figure 3).  Th e shot thus subjugates her immediately to the camera’s instrumental functions,  processing her face through the optical machinery to gauge light reflectiveness  and color, to analyze its symmetry, to assess framing and determine its adequacy  for industrial reproduction. Only following this striking exposition is the spatial context established:  Soraya is seated in a dressing room, body now covered in white as she is being pre- pared for her test: cosmetically treated, primped, subjected to an exhaustive array  of make-up applications, hair-dos, wigs, and costumes. Th roughout the sequence  (as through much of the film) Antonioni shift s constantly through a wide variety  of shot scales and angles. His camerawork, too, partakes in this way in the scan- ning, assessing, and mapping of Soraya. At one point, her eyes are enframed in  extreme close-up when eyeliner is expertly applied: the make-up artist’s hands, his  brush, and the movie camera are all upon her. An overhead shot then isolates her  within the brightly lit, spotless space of the dressing room: propped in her chair,  covered neck to foot, it is as if she is about to undergo a medical procedure (see  figure 4). Scientific, surgical connotations are thus joined with the analytic optical  process: Soraya is in turns a beautiful insect or a rare organism petrified under a  microscope, or a cold distant star that no telescope can quite capture or focalize.  Th e manipulations of her person as pure exteriority underscore her reserve. She  is optically assaulted but also opaque, removed, enclosed in a magnificent shell,  impenetrable, as if untouched by all these procedures that prime her but perhaps  also shield her, like armor. A certain vulnerability can be sensed in her, but Soraya  cannot quite let the camera explore it. She speaks German to her mother over the  telephone, Farsi to her assistant, Italian and English with the crew. Even these  shift s between languages and orders of conversation contribute, somehow, to the  sense of distancing; she will later tell that she is not at home anywhere, East or  West. We see her work through types; we see her blond, brunette, and black; she  mimics a seductress, a gamine, a neurotic—she strikes these poses in succession,  as for a fashion shoot, in direct address to Antonioni’s camera. Th e sequence  culminates with Soraya, in faux neurotic defiance, throwing paint as if onto the  lens. Cinematic time is fragmented with sharp shift s and jump cuts into a series of  gestures. And yet we are, ostensibly, still in the dressing room: is this already a test? A compact transitional scene follows: Soraya is finally being zipped up by her  200 </page> <page sequence="11"> Pass/Fail Figure 4. Antonioni, Il provino: Cosmetic/surgical procedures. dresser into what seems to be her own elegant style. Both dresser and camera do  not leave her as she keeps moving to and fro, in conversation with her assistant/ lady-in-waiting. Her most nuanced performance might be in this little interlude,  which will warrant our return to it in due course. Soon she is accompanied to the  soundstage for what we should consider her “second circle” of testing. Somewhat  like the earlier shift  from the nocturnal exteriors to the bright, hermetic space  of the dressing room, we plunge here from the surrounding darkness of the vast  soundstage to a lavish, traditional drawing-room set that had been constructed  at its center. Th e set is first captured from a great height, bathed in light. An  American director (or some production functionary) explains, in English, his  plan for a telephone interview as part of the test that would give her a chance to  talk. Clearly she need not recite a scene, she need not act, but simply walk, sit, talk,  be. But it is no simple matter to be oneself (whatever that self may be) in front of  the camera: only a star can do it well, and it is a necessary condition of stardom.  Soraya moves through the set, looking through doors, touching potted plants,  cigarettes, furniture. She is shot, alternately, from within the fictional drawing  room set, and from the outside—as if from a meta-fictional order, of which the  encompassing soundstage is part. From this outside space, it is as if the camera  were stealthily peeking into the set: through windows and doors, or from high  above. It seems bent on capturing something in Soraya that the more restricted  view within the set and the “proper” fiction of the screen test cannot grasp. Th e  distanced perspective naturally makes her appear rather small and enclosed within  201 </page> <page sequence="12"> Noa Steimatsky Figure 5. Antonioni, Il provino: Waiting for the test is also a test. the set; it can off er no clear sense of her mastering the space, or even inhabiting  it. In one odd moment, she is glimpsed entirely on her own, sitting on a stool in a  corner of the drawing room set, waiting (see figure 5). It is a particularly equivocal  moment and its equivocation, too, destabilizes our sense of what she is: who is  sitting there? Is it in the broader fiction of the Preface—in anticipation of the  fictionalized test—or does it already constitute part of the test proper? From the  removed position of Antonioni’s camera, we cannot quite tell in what role we are  to see her. Th e boundaries between the internal, fictional set and the larger one  (the location encompassing it) are porous. With that, the breakdown of categories  of being and acting, of person and role, is doubly unsettling. Likewise, the little drama of the telephone interview between the American  director and Soraya seems to oscillate between diff erent states of being. It is  introduced as if Soraya’s answers might be genuine—yet surely they are not  spontaneous, even as Soraya might have taken part in scripting them. Within the  embracing framework of Antonioni’s film, they are patently rehearsed and staged.  RAI reportage footage from the production of Il provino shows Antonioni direct- ing Soraya (see figure 6). Clearly he steers her away from any relaxed disposition:  “don’t let yourself go, stay on edge” and then, “look at the telephone as if it were  a strange object,” he tells her as she rehearses her steps towards the divan to pick  up the receiver.9 But even as Antonioni is celebrated as the director of alienation,  what he is doing here does not seem to result in a texture of performance much  diff erent from what Soraya off ers in the other episodes of I tre volti. A certain  202 </page> <page sequence="13"> Pass/Fail Figure 6. Carlo di Carlo, Antonioni su Antonioni (IT, 2008): RAI footage of Antonioni directing Soraya. coherence can be posited here between Antonioni’s creative temperament,  comprising his attitude to acting, and Soraya’s cinematic persona. But the sum  of the parts does not yield here anything like the intense, enthralling texture  of his directorial synthesis of Monica Vitti. One could almost see Antonioni’s  awareness of this difficulty allegorized in the curious little scene of the American  director stumbling, inexplicably, through a curved transparent maze to reach the  telephone (see figure 7). Th is abstract, symbolic set rhymes, once again, with the  circling roads we have seen leading to the studio entry, but it also foreshadows the  fashion-shoot world of Blow-Up. And yet it erupts out of nowhere, and is never  accounted for—as if it were a random set for an altogether diff erent production,  put into dialogue with this one. Who is calling whom? For a moment it appears  that the director himself—a somewhat Fellini-esque artist-figure in his opera  scarf—is the one being tested, that he fails, but is aff orded some instances of  self-reflection in the process. Twice in Il provino, then, and on diff erent levels of  the fiction (first in the dressing room, staged for Antonioni’s omniscient camera,  and then here, staged for the camera that is intermittently contained within  Antonioni’s encompassing mise-en-scène), telephone conversations are devised  to endow Soraya with relative absorption, intimacy, and interiority. Antonioni’s  203 </page> <page sequence="14"> Noa Steimatsky Figure 7. Antonioni, Il provino: The director in the maze: Is this his test? Where are we? film thus pulls continuously in diff erent directions, shift ing its planes of action  and orders of fiction, embedding one test within another. Il provino threatens to  fissure under its own reflexive layering. A third circle of testing ensues. A turntable is switched on to the tune of  “Moon River,” carrying with it the sweet melancholy of the recent Breakfast at  Tiff any’s (Blake Edwards, US, 1961). It accompanies Soraya’s last scene, which is  entirely without dialogue but realtively dynamic in terms of camera and body  movement. Once again camera angles alternate between shots that inhabit the  fictional screen test from within and shots manifestly from outside the set—from  Antonioni’s omniscient, elevated perspective that captures, along with Soraya, the  studio apparatus as a whole: tracking camera, lights, and crew. Now in evening  dress and tall hairdo, Soraya descends a spiral staircase. She walks through the  drawing-room set, finally approaching and opening a pair of French windows  where gauze curtains billow into motion by large, noisy fans. Excessively bright  lights are directed at her from across the windows: in a fiction film, these would  translate to full sunlight—a light that Antonioni’s nocturnal tale never provides.  In a startling reverse shot to Soraya’s gaze out the French windows, we see crew  members maneuver two wind tunnels animated by stage fans to blow strong  artificial wind directly in Soraya’s face (see figures 8–9). Both light and wind  seem exaggerated: the plants sway, the curtains are wildly blown inward; Soraya  seems to brace herself to remain still, planted in her spot (see figure 10). It is not  nature’s elements that assault her but movie artifice, which violently exposes her  204 </page> <page sequence="15"> Pass/Fail Figure 8.

Wind is not, apparently, an unheard-of device of screen testing: Irene  Gustafson and Julia Zay make note of it in Greta Garbo’s last screen test, of 1949.  Th ere, the camera’s extended, merciless perusal of that divine, aging visage in a  medium close-up is exacerbated by an artificial breeze, creating a spectacle of her  tussled hair waving away from her face.10 In retrospect, we surmise that it must  205 </page> <page sequence="16"> Noa Steimatsky Figure 10. Antonioni, Il provino: Soraya as figurehead, à la Garbo. have been in view of this screen test that Garbo sealed her withdrawal from the  screen. Although we may still be starstruck viewing this late test, it must be the  juxtaposition with her own image, years earlier, at her peak, that Garbo could not  tolerate. Th e tilt of her head and the breeze in her hair conjure the ultimate star  image: figurehead Garbo as Queen Christina in Rouben Mamoulian’s eponymous  film of 1933. Soraya’s posture in the wind invites, more or less explicitly, just this  comparison with the ultimate star image: not event but idea, not human, but  divine.11 Can she take up this figurehead position? Does she pass the test? Th e  paparazzi outdoors—themselves braced against the elements, having tirelessly  attempted through the long night to enter the studio, to catch a glimpse of Soraya,  to confirm a rumor—do not know. Th ey fail to capture, in an image, both the  princess’s entry and her exit at dawn. Nevertheless, they concoct a story (not  unlike the stories actually occupying the contemporary tabloids), delivered to the  public in hollow affirmation, which the reporter dictates to the press office over  the phone: “Soraya will be an actress.” In a contemporary review, Adriano Aprà singles out the overhead shot that  punctuates the telephone interview (see figure 11). Th e camera is perched near the  studio ceiling, capturing from a great height (perhaps exaggerated by the choice of  lens) the illuminated set and all the surrounding machinery as a totality, plunged  within the vast space of the soundstage. It is in such moments, Aprà writes, that  Antonioni literalizes the position of one who observes from above: a position of  knowledge, and as if from outside of the apparatus.12 But is there such an outsider  206 </page> <page sequence="17"> Pass/Fail Figure 11. Antonioni, Il provino: The set as a whole, like a planet in the studio constellation. position? Several of Antonioni’s narratives of failure—most obviously Blow-Up  and Th e Passenger—trace the pitfalls of some such ambition to both partake in  experience and achieve at the same time a removed (critical, or non-committal)  perspective on the matter at hand. Possibly such attitude is most salient with  Antonioni’s male protagonists: it supports one’s reading them as surrogates for the  filmmaker, and regarding his attitude to his craft . Aprà compares Antonioni here,  unfavorably, to Jean-Luc Godard—thinking, surely, of the recent Le Mépris (FR/ IT, 1963), itself produced nearby, in Cinecittà. Godard is able to embrace both the  truth and the falsity of the cinema apparatus while Antonioni, Aprà maintains,  tends to drift  toward abstraction and literariness. Antonioni’s episode is thus  suspended in a sort of limbo where interior and exterior positions, like truth and  falsity, eff ace each other so that the ensemble always hovers “only on the threshold  of expression” and committing to none. Other reviewers approached even more critically the ideological knot of  Il provino, seeing Antonioni trapped in the role of removed observer while  indulging, at the same time, in an “intellectual striptease.” Sandro Zambetti thus  observed that, even as the film industry is exposed here for all its technological  and ideological schemes, Antonioni’s episode remains, finally, “an exercise that  mystifies even [its own] demystification.”13 In a particularly shrewd commentary  on the ideological constitution of Soraya’s image (in the media at large and as it  is invested in I tre volti), Rita Porena emphasizes how the mass media had already  thoroughly processed Soraya’s identity as empress and subsequently as an “ex”:  207 </page> <page sequence="18"> Noa Steimatsky ex-empress, ex-wife. Divested of any use, and invested with sheer exchange value,  Soraya’s image as a consumer good, drained of subjectivity, is not substantially  altered in Antonioni’s film. But discerning a certain melancholy in Soraya’s  subjugated, impassive, and alienated disposition as it is met by camera, Porena  concludes her review, titled “Il destino di una cosa/Th e Destiny of a Th ing” (or  of “Something”) with a striking, even redemptive observation: Silence would obliterate her: from here follows the public desolation of her  romances, consumed in nightclubs and fashionable resorts, wherever there is  someone who would recognize her. Finally, the cinema: in this incredible film,  this museum of a dead object’s memories, an inconstant shadow struggles to  materialize through the emblems of its past existence. If it’s true—and it is—that Soraya made this movie so as to become  someone, to earn an identity, the result is particularly astonishing to behold: her  thick and expressionless face, invaded by flesh and furrowed by eyes without a  gaze, her face persists as an anthropomorphic thing.14 What Porena might be seeking here—aft er such sharp ideological parsing of  Soraya’s objectification—is perhaps not a definitive conception of Soraya’s iden- tity, nor a confirmation of her acting vocation or star charisma, but more modest,  “inconstant shadow”: an inkling of the person, an ephemeral, vulnerable being  caught in a film that constitutes a stifling “museum of a dead object’s memories.”  Porena’s closing oxymoron is particularly striking: What is the “anthropomorphic  thing”—or “anthropomorphic something”—that persists in the inert flesh, in the  opaque, unreflective gaze, through the film’s elaborate cultivation of surface? Is it  like the “human something” by which Stanley Cavell described screen presence:  that being that the screen performer lends to the role and that projects through  the film’s mechanical mediation between presence and absence? Th e “physical and  temperamental endowment” of a star—who should be both a “vivid subject for  the camera” and an accomplished performer—projects that “human something”  most radiantly.15 But for all her grace and her celebrity, Soraya—all agree—does  not have the gift  of star radiance and cannot project it. Without it, no beauty or  posture or deliberate eff ort, no preparation or skill, will suffice. Soraya’s celebrity allure as an opulent figure of beauty and fashion—an  enticingly exotic and jet-set spectacle—is a given, imported wholesale into the  film. Yet there is a discrepancy between public celebrity and the condition of  movie stardom; it is even more conspicuous because Soraya plays her own role.  Can she negotiate a dynamic relation between her person and role? In parsing the  coordinates of that “human something” on screen, Antonioni is not principally  invested in juxtaposing here a string of potential roles—seductress, gamine,  208 </page> <page sequence="19"> Pass/Fail Figure 12. Antonioni, Il provino: Choreography of non-actor and star. blond, brunette, all parodied in the dressing room vignettes—but in laying bare  the oppressive conditions of being on screen. It is not a liberating celebration of  potentialities, but a confrontational, alienating, and self-alienating process. We  now recall the brief interlude in which Soraya is “dressed up as herself ” when  preparing to leave for the soundstage (see figure 12). Her dresser—a silent, older  woman with un-made-up, tired features—continuously navigates around Soraya  to arrange her dress while the princess keeps moving to and fro in conversation  with her assistant/lady-in-waiting. It is by virtue of the juxtaposition with these  two women that the predicament of Soraya (the actual Soraya) is elucidated  here. Th e assistant criticizes Soraya’s reticence, urging her to expose her feelings  to the camera. Soraya responds that she will do her best to succeed.16 Th is brief  exchange in Farsi is certainly scripted dialogue, yet no subtitles are provided to  translate it, even though this multilingual film contains Italian subtitles for the  German telephone conversation with the mother earlier on and for the extensive  English dialogues in the soundstage sequence that follows.17 Possibly, Soraya’s  withdrawn quality is deliberately amplified by this withholding of subtitles, as  by the complexity of blocking, camerawork, and editing of this scene as a whole.  Th e dresser is silent throughout: whether she understands Farsi is not as critical  as the sense in which she is, by virtue of her position and class, transparent to  these two aristocratic women, even as she is quite present through the scene.  Th e camera thus follows the three women’s movements to and fro in medium  209 </page> <page sequence="20"> Noa Steimatsky shot, continually reframing them within the shallow space, against a red curtain  and free-standing tri-part mirror that dominate the background. Th e mirror  reflections that fragment and reduplicate the figures, as well as a conspicuous  jump cut that insinuates itself into the elegant choreography of bodies and camera,  introduce some agitation and dissociation into a scene that is otherwise fluid,  contained, both intimate and theatrical. Th e significance of this little scene is crystallized, in my view, in the women’s  exit: Th e camera, now outside the doorway, pans with Soraya and her assistant,  settling into a perspective of the deserted corporate corridor, where the women  recede into the depth of the image. Shot duration is prolonged: we notice the  diagonal graphic play of fluorescent strips running through the ceiling, the dark  moldings and the light reflections marking the space. Th en the dresser, too,  emerges into the shot and follows the two elegant, lean women some distance  behind (see figure 13). Th e entire being of this anonymous non-actor—her  deportment, her way of clutching a handbag, what Marcel Mauss would call the  “techniques” of her body—clearly locates the silent dresser in the heavy-laden  world of working people, bearing vestiges of neorealism.18 In this way, this woman  is contrasted first with the upper-class ladies whom she services and, more broadly,  creates an incongruency with the emphatically contemporary, corporate world of  the movie studio, its sets and costumes, and the wide-screen Technicolor by which  we see the lot. Th e duration and pacing of the shot accentuates this gap, which is  as existential as it is material and social. But Antonioni never moralizes with broad social gestures. His primary  concern in this film is, surely, how distinctly these diff erent people transpire in  a filmic world revolving around the apparatus of cinema and media celebrity;  he is concerned with the precarious relationship of actor, non-actor, character,  and star. Th e dresser patently dissolves into her role—not by any special quality  of performance, but simply by being and doing what she does—her role is co- extensive with her. Soraya, likewise, should be playing her own role here, but she  is not anonymous; quite the contrary, her celebrity makes her conspicuous: she  is always at the center of attention in the vast enterprise that revolves around her.  Yet if she is to fill her own shoes, her own role, she must be a star, or else she cannot  be. As Edgar Morin observed in his aesthetic anthropology of the movie star, the  anonymity of the non-actor borrowed from life, as it were, to “play herself ” is  matched by the star, who is always herself.19 In between the non-actor and the star,  both of whom—from diff erent vantage points—play their own roles, there yawns  the world of the “actors,” neither here nor there. Th ese are the positions off ered to  Soraya and her dresser in this revealing little interlude. Does Soraya inhabit her  position? Can she achieve stardom? It is this, and nothing less, that is required of  her. It is this that is being put to the test. 210 </page> <page sequence="21"> Pass/Fail Figure 13. Antonioni, Il provino: A neorealist shadow in the studio. We see Soraya subject herself and shield herself. Between these attitudes,  which are not opposed, we sense her struggle through the numerous treatments  and makeovers, like an anesthetized patient demobilized in a clinic. We sense her  struggle through the two phone calls, with her mother and with a stranger, off  and  on stage—and all on film. We understand that each call is, in its way, distressing  to her. We see her trying and failing to inhabit the set, to brace herself against the  wind and light. She struggles through the irony of Antonioni’s own devices: the  entrapping and invasive quality of his camera positions and framing, the extreme  close-ups, the high angle shots, the internal enframing by elements of the mise-en- scène, the reduction and isolation of her figure within the busy set—the ensemble  of the soundstage elements locked in a huge, well-oiled mechanism devised to  process and reproduce her (see figure 14). All the demands of movie business,  the aggression of the press, and the mass market which joins them; all the studio  apparatus, the assaulting and fragmenting forces of cinematic technology and  form, comprising the director’s own gaze—all these are deliberately joined here,  in oppressive, alienating test conditions that not every actor can sustain. In the telephone interview, the American director presses Soraya: Why does  she want to be an actress? She says that she wants to be diff erent from what she is  and that, yes, she would be willing to play the part of a poor, badly dressed woman.  Th is, however, is not a part she is off ered in the screen test, or in I tre volti: it is her  dresser’s part. Th e only possible role for her is one that reduplicates her celebrity  persona as it has already been sealed by the media. It must translate, on film, to  star quality. Th e diff erent episodes—for all their unevenness—are thus consistent  211 </page> <page sequence="22"> Noa Steimatsky Figure 14. Antonioni, Il provino: Caught within the studio apparatus. in the image they yield of Soraya. As Carlo di Carlo observed, “Soraya can only be  Soraya.”20 Is this the same as “playing her own part”? How well does she do it, and  does it suffice to make her into a cinematic subject, in the way in which Garbo  is always Garbo—silent, divine, speaking, laughing? Can the cinema rediscover  her not as an inert object, but as a subject? Can she lend herself, as Cavell would  put it, to projection? And yet Soraya—being Soraya—cannot dissolve into a role  or into the apparatus of fiction. She can either be a star, or not be. Th e screen test,  with all its artifice (more or less matched to her persona), embodies the ways in  which the resources of the movie industry are invested in the fashioning of a star  who, in her person, is the industry’s most precious resource. But in exposing these  resources, in witnessing how an entire machinery of star production bears down  upon the singular human subject, in seeing Soraya somehow resist or block the  gaze that the cinema would draw from her, Antonioni’s film turns things over.  Rather than the mystical birth of stars out of movie magic, it is the little mystery  of the person—at once celebrated and unknown—that emerges as the residue of  the screen test. It survives even in Antonioni’s overdetermined project. In the second version of his “Work of Art ” essay, Walter Benjamin diagnosed  the self-alienation of the actor when confronted with his or her mechanical  reproducibility. Th is raises, in principle, Benjamin says, the situation of a test as  fundamental to the workings of the apparatus: Film makes test performances capable of being exhibited, by turning that ability  212 </page> <page sequence="23"> Pass/Fail itself into a test. Th e film actor performs not in front of an audience but in  front of an apparatus. Th e film director occupies exactly the same position as  the examiner in an aptitude test. To perform in the glare of arc lamps while  simultaneously meeting the demands of the microphone is a test performance  of the highest order. To accomplish it is to preserve one’s humanity in the face  of the apparatus. . . . Th e film actor [thus places] that apparatus in the service  of his triumph. In the case of film, the fact that the actor represents someone else before  the audience matters much less than the fact that he represents himself before  the apparatus. . . . Th e representation of human beings by means of an apparatus has made  possible a highly productive use of the human being’s self-alienation.21 What does it mean “to accomplish” such a test? What are the conditions of passing  it, and what does it mean to fail it? How, in the first place, to follow Benjamin’s  language here, can one’s humanity be tested? It is an impossible question, certainly  aft er its abuses in the worst “tests” of industrial modernity. Th e failed test is, surely,  itself an all too human experience. It is not a question of delivering (or failing to  deliver) an expert performance; it is, Benjamin says, about preserving one’s human- ity. What is intimated here is that a human self—the singular person as subject  of representation, projected (or rather projectable)—can survive in the land of  technology. Moreover, it can be born out of the actor’s capacity to exploit most  productively her self-alienation. Miriam Hansen glosses in this way a redemptive  potential in Benjamin’s suggestion that the cinema can render the adaptation, but  also the mis-adaptation, of the human sensorium to the technological regimes of  modernity, materially and publically perceivable, projectable.22 Success and failure  are, in eff ect, diff erent modes of accomplishing it: Between them an array of dif- ferent cinemas, diff erent types of performance, and diff erent modes of address and  forms of attention endowed by filmmaker (and, in turn, by spectator) allow for a  vast range. Just as Chaplin projects in virtuoso form the person’s mis-adaptation  to modernity’s apparatuses—thematized in his films and expressed in his body  and gestural repertoire—Soraya’s particular inadequacy to the apparatus intimates  another form of misadaptation that is, undoubtedly, of its time. One turns full  circle from the technological apparatus and the mass market to the singular  experience. Th is is the cinema’s communion with its spectator. Th e star projects brightly. But given the modern anxiety of the subject’s  demise, given the end of portraiture, given the evacuation of the human form  and the particularly grim resonances this idea has acquired aft er Auschwitz,  given the contemporary commodification of subject construction and of being as  performance, one considers that it is also through some measures of failure that  213 </page> <page sequence="24"> Noa Steimatsky the subject flickers. Not through myths of integrity or in triumphant plenitude,  this mode of defeat is distinguished (I borrow freely from Benjamin here) from  “the realm of ‘beautiful semblance,’ which for so long was regarded as the only  sphere in which [art] could thrive.”23 It need not hang on any special technique  or acting feat, nor on classical mechanisms of identification that can draw out but  sometimes obscure the person. Nor does beauty off er guarantees. Th e person’s  inadequacy and self-alienation—the failure of the test—is one channel to this  truth, even if by agonizing detour; it can even be its generative moment. Such recognition is forcefully staged in certain climactic scenes of post- classical cinema involving failed screen tests such as in Vincente Minnelli’s Th e  Bad and the Beautiful (US, 1952), or Bette Davis’s mid-career vehicle Th e Star  (Stuart Heisler, US, 1952). Luchino Visconti dwells upon it in the devastating  penultimate scene of Bellissima (IT, 1951). Anna Magnani’s little girl, shoved here  and there throughout the film, between tests and makeovers, is finally seen in a  projected screen test by the director and his entourage. Alessandro Blasetti, the  greatest Italian filmmaker of the 1930s and 40s, plays himself here. Th e child’s hair  had been badly cropped by some kid in the chaotic neglect of the dressing room,  her little face made-up incongruously, and it is clear from the start that she has  no skills to speak of. She does not sing and dance, nor can she move her body like  some of her contestants, whose expert mimicry of sexualized movie starlets ranges  from the entertaining to the ridiculous and the obscene. Her greatest challenge  in the screen test is to blow out birthday candles; even this she fails to do, and  bursts out crying. Th e production crew rolls with laughter as they watch her facial  contortions joined with real tears—in close-up (see figure 15). Th e scene is at once  melodramatically obvious and remarkably subtle. We see the pathos of a mother  seeing her child’s humiliation: seeing her, finally, as a child rather than as object  and instrument of her own fantasies and of the industry’s exploitation. But in the  midst of this debacle, we begin to see something that Magnani cannot see: Blasetti,  serious and intense, notices something (see figure 16). Something about the girl’s  projection of her inadequacy—her defenselessness, the inevitability and bareness  of her failure—captivates his attention. I’ve no doubt that Antonioni appreciated  Visconti’s film: he responded to it soon aft er, in La signora senza camelie/Th e Lady  without Camellias (IT, 1953), another melodrama set in Cinecittà, intertwining  success and failure in the shift ing fortunes of a star. Perhaps it is through Soraya’s unspoken failure and her perceptible inad- equacy that her test—in its varied phases and with its heterogeneous orders of  performance —emerges as a human experience. Of course, this too may be part of  the fiction, but that does not make it any less poignant. Th e control that Antonioni  exerts and the reserve that he studies in Soraya are counterpoised. His foreground- ing of the studio apparatus—its lights and mirrors, its hard surfaces, its clinical  214 </page> <page sequence="25"> Figure 15. Luchino Visconti, Bellissima (1951). Figure 16. Visconti, Bellissima: Blasetti notices something. </page> <page sequence="26"> Noa Steimatsky procedures—fluctuates with the endeavor to commit it, when all is said and done,  to its human subject. Th e capacity to locate some power of the person—a return of  the gaze—in the mechanically reproduced image can also be located in impassive  being, and in defeat. At times, very little suffices for that power to flicker in the  interplay of endurance and surrender, of potency and vulnerability, that the test  situation triggers. Elsewhere, I have written about facial opacity, resistance, and  reticence in paradigmatic instances of film history, also tracing variants of the test  situation as part of the predicament of the subject caught in the technological  medium.24 We find these elements staged in the form of interrogation (Dreyer’s  Passion of Joan of Arc, FR, 1928), or where character and actor are pressured, split,  doubled, fragmented, abstracted, and re-assembled (Hitchcock’s Th e Wrong Man  of 1956 [US] and Vertigo [US] of 1958 stand out in this regard). But the actual  configuration of the screen test in the movie studio lays bare the process: the  actor is dressed, made up, goes through the motions, is confronted with glaring  lights, with wind blown by huge fans. Something can be preserved, or revealed,  or violently drawn from the person in this process—regardless of whether the  role is won or lost. It is not clear whether Antonioni knew, already in 1965, how radically Warhol  engaged with these ideas in this same period. His portraits of celebrity (like those  of Edie Sedgwick in her several Screen Tests, in Face, in Outer and Inner Space, of  1965 [US]) and anonymity (Blow Job, US, 1964) alike all have strong test compo- nents in them. Confronting the camera head on, the subject struggles—subju- gated to highly restrictive and demanding conditions; freed of narrative fiction  but assaulted, interrogated, tested physically, formally, socially, psychically—the  subject struggles and in this way returns, under duress, shielded only to a point  by masquerading, by chatter, by irony. Even as categories of performance and  being are broken, even as the author’s position is ostensibly evacuated and anxiety  escalates with duration, even as the mechanical imposition of beginning and end  is patently inadequate to human time (too much, too little—no measure is right),  Warhol’s withdrawal of judgment liberates even those “failing” the test. Th is is the  real achievement of his film portraits. Antonioni’s strongest films—tracing, time and again, the dissolution of  forms and figures in the spaces of industrial modernity—always revolve around  some human eff ort that pierces through the device and lets the person emerge:  Person and apparatus, in this way, evolve and redefine each other.25 Beyond the  formal accomplishment—the play of costume and color, proximity and distance,  screening and framing, inside and out—and aft er its reflexive irony is spent,  Antonioni’s staging of one woman’s confrontation with the cinema machine is  still construed as a human feat. Th e performative situation of the screen test sets  it in motion. Failure is one of its instruments and, perhaps, its most poignant  216 </page> <page sequence="27"> Pass/Fail form in this era. Th e failed experience of the test is an all too human experience.  It is, aft er all, the situation of failure and loss—not the aggressive exuberance,  not the possessive creativity of the winner—that eff ects such a turn inward, such  a reflective consciousness and, within it, what I venture to call a flaring of self.  Under the heightened conditions of the test, in the light and the wind, Soraya’s  inadequacy seeps through her beauty. All institutional and market dictates, all  technological mechanisms and formal control, all psychic tensions meet the body  of this woman and, refracting off  it, address us sporadically. Here lies the subtle  melodramatic streak that runs through Antonioni’s narratives of maladjustment  and the sickness of Eros, engraving his films’ pristine surfaces. Th ese do not  conceal his commitment when all is said and done—in La signora senza camelie,  L’avventura, La Notte, Red Desert—to the human subject who is at the heart of it  all. Antonioni would not deny this: he was a director of the sentiments. Noa Steimatsky is an associate professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago.
