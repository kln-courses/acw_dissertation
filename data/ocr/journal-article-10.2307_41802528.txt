<plain_text><page sequence="1">Blackout Freedom, without Power Christopher A llsobrook Abstract : This article attributes the conception of ' freedom- without-power' which dominates contemporary Western political philosophy to a reification of social agency that mystifies contexts of human capacities and achievements. It suggests that Plato's analogy between the structure of the soul and the polis shows how freedom is a consequence, rather than a condition, of political rela- tions, mediated by inter-subjective contestation. From this basis, the article draws on the work of Raymond Geuss to argue against pre-political ethical frameworks in political philosophy, in favour of a more contextually sensitive, self-critical approach to ethics. Such reciprocal ethical-political integration addresses problems of ideological complicity that may arise if freedom is dis- cretely abstracted from history and power in political philosophy. Finally, the article roughly reconstructs a critical account of African identity from writings of Steven Biko to illuminate symptoms of 'meritocratic apartheid' in South Africa today which Thad Metz's influential pre-political conception of ubuntu obscures, by abstracting the figure of African personhood from politically sig- nificant historical conditions. Keywords : freedom, Geuss, meritocracy, power, ubuntu White society is quite agreed that blacks have to come up ... A lot of them don't see that this entails them coming down. And this is the problem. We talk about that, and we get a whole lot of reaction and self-preservation mechanisms from them. (Biko 2008: 34) Let us assume a basic distinction may be drawn in social and political theory, between a dominant formal, abstract conception of freedom - distinct from and opposed to power - and the more substantive, materialist understanding, of a 'motley crew' of radical critical and conservative thinkers, of freedom as fundamentally linked to power. What motivates this fault-line? If power involves a capacity to constrain the actions of others, surely it is one's relative position in a relationship of power that determines one's level of freedom in the relationship? Unless our ends coincide, my freedom to pursue my own ends diminishes while I am meeting the demands of another party, whose free- Theoria, September 2012 doi: 10.3 167/th.20 12.59 13205</page><page sequence="2">Blackout: Freedom, without Power 61 dom to achieve her own ends is thereby augmented. Why assume a default opposition between freedom and power in political philosophy that sides free- dom with weakness? Why oppose this? This article attributes the liberal-republican conception of ' freedom- with- out-power' which dominates contemporary Western political philosophy to a reification of social agency that mystifies the historical social, political and economic contexts of human capacities and achievements. Traditional social contract theory, for example, abstracts free, individual consent from the very political conditions which shape it, as a condition, rather than an outcome of contestation. Rawls' counterfactual 'veil of ignorance' and, even, Habermas' 'ideal speech conditions' follow this analytical trope. Such abstractions are not harmless speculations, but function ideologically amongst prevailing struc- tures of domination and exploitation by factoring out underlying tensions and contradictions in ideal political thought.1 To conceive of freedom in a purely negative, non-substantive sense, is, indeed, the only the way to do justice to the concept, since a positive concep- tion of freedom is intrinsically limiting. But (to follow Kant with Hegel), bear- ing this insight in mind, if no concrete manifestation of freedom can conform to such an intrinsically abstract ideal, all instances of freedom must be deter- mined by contextual limitations. Though the contextual factors that shape free- dom may be thought of as 'limitations' on the concept, in its ideal sense, it is precisely these factors that make it actual. One such factor is power. Plato's analogy between the structure of the particular soul and the general polis, I suggest, illustrates nicely how freedom is a consequence, rather than a condition, of political relations, mediated by inter-subjective contestation. The analogy provides a helpful political philosophical insight, also evident in Niet- zsche's notion of will to power, that the transcendent, abstract form of static, individual personhood is a briefly reconciled abstraction - a snapshot - of the continually changing effects of dynamic tensions: internally (intra-subjec- tively), between conflicting appetites, conflicting, in turn, with pride and ratio- nality; and, externally (inter-subjectively), in contexts of social engagement. Healthy cities, like healthy minds and bodies, depend on constructive align- ments of potentially cooperative, potentially contradictory, forces. The philo- sophical task of politics is to recognise and reconcile these forces, like premises in an argument, to support rational outcomes which do not frustrate but, rather, accommodate and incorporate diverse ends, in a manner that each could not accomplish on its own. In this easily misunderstood, much dismissed analogy in The Republic , we see that the realisation of human freedom depends on the reconciliation of freedom and power. On the basis of this claim, that freedom is politically embedded, I draw on the work of Raymond Geuss to explain why political contexts of the origin and application of 'freedom' are normatively significant. Moreover, with Geuss, I argue against pre-political ethical frameworks in political philosophy, in favour of a historically and contextually sensitive, self-critical approach to</page><page sequence="3">62 Christopher Allsobrook the 'necessary illusions' (as he puts it) of ethics. Such critical, reciprocal eth- ical-political integration, I maintain, helps to address problems of ideological complicity that arise if freedom is discretely abstracted from history and power in political philosophy. To illustrate these points, I draw a critical account of African identity, or, personhood, from the writings of Steven Biko, which addresses ideological blind spots in Thaddeus Metz's influential liberal-communitarian interpreta- tion of ubuntu. I show how this critical account of ubuntu illuminates symp- toms of 'meritocratic apartheid' in South Africa today, which Metz's pre-political conception obscures, with ideological effect, by abstracting the figure of African personhood from the background of politically significant historical conditions. In sum, this critical account of implications of the use of freedom as a depoliticised normative concept in political philosophy proceeds as follows: Plato - freedom is politically embedded; Geuss and Nietzsche - the historical and political contexts of origin and application of freedom are normatively significant; Biko - African human freedom has been blackened by whites. Freedom in the City, Freedom in the Soul A neutral independent 'subject' ... the sublime self-deception that interprets weak- ness as freedom, and ... being thus-and-thus as a merit. (Nietzsche 2009: 13) In Outside Ethics , Geuss claims that Plato takes political philosophy from an 'immanent perspective on human life' to a 'transcendent, extra-empirical per- spective'. He argues that the myth of the cave in The Republic moves away from Socrates' 'common-sense evaluating of propositions' ('testing them for internal consistency, plausibility and coherence with everyday experience and received opinion') to the idea that the 'correct' 'understanding of the good' is 'in 'a place beyond the heavens', to which only the philosopher has access (Geuss 2004: 43). This criticism of Plato follows a similar criticism of Catholic clergy, during the Reformation, whose consolidation of power was maintained by privileged, literate access to the Word of God (secured, in turn, by consolidation of power): Plato's academisation of Socratic philosophy may be said to corrupt the teachings of a people's prophet, who took to the streets, criticising the business of philosophical rhetoric, crafted as an ossified set of tools for the well-to-do (used to ward off the challenges of vulgar upstarts). Plato reverses such dangerous developments, pricing out the hoi polloi, and cloistering dom- inant Forms of moral norms under the secure command of nobility. In contrast to such 'idealistic', reified Platonist readings of Form that the allegory of the cave, for example, is characteristically taken to support, this ambiguous myth ought to be read in relation to the background analogy in</page><page sequence="4">Blackout: Freedom, without Power 63 The Republic between soul and polis, person and city. To recall, Socrates sug- gests looking for justice as a virtue of cities, as a means to identify justice as a virtue of the individual, on the grounds that justice in the city is bigger and more apparent than justice in a person (2010: §368c-369b). The weakness of this move has often puzzled interpreters. I would argue, the analogy provides evidence that Plato thinks the transcendent form of justice is not limited but realised by immanent contexts of agonistic social engagement in the polis, which give the Form of Justice its determinate content. Just as Justice, for Plato, cannot be defined in advance of its concrete manifestation in historical human interaction (the polis), so individual character (the soul) is likewise shaped and defined by one's conflict-ridden social environment. Broadly speaking, the analogy between private personhood and public citi- zenship represents a normative dialectical expression of form and substance, the general and particular. Existence and essence are fundamentally intercon- nected. What we humans truly are, for example, is what we ought to be, and what we ought to be is historically mediated by our interactions. The teleological essence of human nature is constructed by the rationally reflective, value-driven, material existence of the political animal, through an ongoing mediation of inter- nal and external forces of opposition (spirit/appetite, warriors/merchants, etc.). This 'anti-Platonisť reading of the soul-polis analogy maintains: the criti- cism of idealism in Plato's dissident theory of forms is a proto-Kantian warn- ing: 'Do not stipulate the good by tyrannical fiat!' De-contested specification of the form of the good entails a false infinite, of attenuated, delimited tran- scendence. To discretely abstract Freedom from relations of Power is to posit an ideal bereft of explicit content. My young child's 'no', for example, derives much of its substance and significance from my directives - haplessly shaped, in turn, by his devastating critique of sovereignty. It is worth considering the common misconception of Plato's criticism of idealism (as idealism) in relation to a common misconception of Karl Marx's criticism of ideology. Marx is also found embalmed in reified forms he tried to negate (by opponents and supporters). His critical contextualisation of the social function of religion, in the claim, 'religion is the opiate of the masses' is most remembered as a rejection of religion. However, Marx's conception of 'ideology' should be understood (in the context of The German Ideology ), as an unmasking, not of religious illusions, but, of the unmasking of religious illusions, by supposedly enlightened critics who dismiss religious forms as superstitious nonsense, failing to penetrate their historical material depth. Such abstract religious criticism, Marx argues, betrays a failure to comprehend the determinate socio-economic content of religious ideas, perpetuating the metaphysical illusion of free-floating thought it ostensibly rejects (1970: 37, 46).2 Marx situates the conditions for such religious idealism, and idealistic religious criticism, in the socio-economic context of an exploitative division of labour, taken for granted and unwittingly perpetuated by intellectuals' nar- cissistic illusions of self-subsistence.3</page><page sequence="5">64 Christopher A liso brook How may we conceive of liberty, autonomy, agency and freedom in polit- ical philosophy if we follow the analogy between the soul and the city, the person and the polis? Of the City, in the context of the 2008 financial crisis, Geuss writes, Few people are now still naïve enough to take the full 'free-market' ideology at face value. A 'free-market' is obviously a complex and highly artificial social con- struct that requires continuous political intervention to survive. It is not in any interesting sense 'natural', and is clearly as much a realm of systematic coercion as of freedom and individual choice. The question is not if, but how markets should be constrained and structured. (2010: 112) Individual agency, by analogy, is a complex and highly artificial social con- struct that is realised through mediated contexts of political interaction. The free- dom of the particular individual is mediated through general political interaction. Economic models of the market, abstracted from power, overlook and support existing states of play. Likewise, psychological models of the mind, abstracted from social conditions, attribute responsibility for collective social pathologies to individuals. Freedom defined in abstraction from power, in public, is determined by power in private. Political philosophers should therefore rationally reflect upon, not uncritically reiterate, freedom's present political constitution. Ought-ism in Political Philosophy Without some account of relative powers, imposing one law for the vulture and the lamb can easily mean death for all the lambs. (Geuss on Nietzsche, in Geuss 2008: 92) I have argued that Plato's formalisation of ideas (in a dialectical account of relations of form and content, general and particular) is critical of the one- sided idealism for which it is caricatured. Nietzsche's contextually sensitive critical treatment of religious idealism is also frozen, like Marx, in this polar manner. The message of the madman, taken for Nietzsche, is remembered as 'God is dead'. Yet the passage where the claim is made does not assert but, rather, interrogates the meaning and underlying context of such superficial secular assumptions in modern thought (Nietzsche 2001: §125). Nietzsche's opposition to morality takes issue with the de-contextualised hypostatisation of human processes of evaluation in dominant forms of Christian morality. Heidegger, following on with the thought, explains that the 'living faith of early Christianity was calcified by the intellectual schemata of Antiquity' (Geuss 2004: 57) (though, the rigid schema of his own explanation occludes dynamic Ancient sceptical approaches to right living).4 In many respects, Nietzsche's wretched 'Christian morality' resembles the morality Christ criticised: a reified system of dogmatic injunctions that distorts</page><page sequence="6">Blackout: Freedom, without Power 65 the contexts of emergence and application of its moral subject and object. But Nietzsche criticises Christian morality, in particular, for claiming for itself unconditional obligations 'grounded' in free moral agency, supposed to be universally and equally applicable to all humans. Such moralism, which pre- supposes unconditional authority and unconditioned agency, assumes that only free human actions have good or bad moral value, depending on the quality of the choice, for which the agent is uniquely responsible, since she could have done otherwise (Geuss 1999: 170-1). This grounding of duty in freedom, abstracted from power, persists in neo-Kantian dilemmas and antinomies. Recipes are cooked up in kitchens. 'Free agency' (conceived of as a subject apart from contexts of political engagement) derives its determinate content from lived experience. So, what does this concept tell us about the self-con- ception of the modern individual who imagines it? Questioning the extent to which rule-governed conceptions of politics are valuable prior to any study of a context of action, Geuss draws a satirical anal- ogy, in Politics and the Imagination , between Don Quixote and the figure of the autonomous modern subject (or, 'self-made Don') freed from traditional bonds, responsible for self-legislation and the rational organisation of his own life, according to clear, generalisable rules that he has established. Quixote puts together and fetishises an anachronistic codex of rules gov- erning chivalrous conduct, to follow slavishly, in the secure belief that, 'as long as he follows these rules, he need have no concern about the conse- quences' (Geuss 2010: 64). He is never afflicted with inner doubts or moral uncertainty, even though he can never be cognitively certain whether he has followed the law or his drives, and he has no idea of what impact his conscious decision will have on the world (ibid.: 67). The figure of Quixote demonstrates how the association of freedom and imagination risks madness in the absence of consideration of concrete political factors. Like Nietzsche, Geuss rejects the idea of a universally accessible, transcen- dental moral perspective, to serve as a foundational normative framework with which to analyse and evaluate all empirical institutions and arrangements in political philosophy and the interaction of free individual moral agents. Con- temporary political philosophy treats politics in this moralised fashion as 'applied ethics'. Though political philosophy may not be value-free, Geuss argues it is a mistake to think we should therefore have to start political phi- losophy with an ideal, systematic, a priori theory of ethics, to prescribe and evaluate modes of human behaviour in the political sphere. It is equally prob- lematic to base ethics on an individualistic, pre-political, anthropological con- ception of autonomous moral agency, along with some supposedly shared 'ethical intuitions', presupposed on behalf of the common man and established without reference to the history, politics, economics or psychology of any actual human beings. The dominant contemporary neo-Kantian liberal paradigm of 'ethics-first' political philosophy gives a distorted view of politics as a form of rational</page><page sequence="7">66 Christopher A llsobrook deliberation grounding a political order, or, as a deductive inference from cer- tain premises leading to a political judgement (ibid.: 5). In real politics, 'stan- dards of evaluation are changing and up for re-negotiation'. 'Every perspective has a concrete historical genesis and location.' Geuss acknowledges the impor- tant imaginative role played in politics by conceptual abstractions, culture and values. But it is crucial to remember that ethics is historically contingent: 'ethics is usually dead politics: the hand of a victor in some past conflict reach- ing out to extend its grip on the present and future' (ibid.: 42). Just as there can be no value-free politics, there can be no pre-political ethical values. In the historical emancipatory phase of the challenge to aristocracy, classic liber- als treated the use of universal moral categories in political philosophy with suspicion, like Marx, as 'an absolutization of historically specific reasoning', which 'fetters human progress' (Geuss 2004: 16). Where Kant aims for a 'pure normative standpoint', 'to avoid real world conflict and instability', Rawls nullifies the relevance of existing political rela- tions with a 'veil of ignorance' 'designed to occlude empirical information that might prejudice the normative force of the outcome' (Geuss 2004: 33). Attempting to describe a 'reflective equilibrium' that would be attained by fully rational agents (engaged in discussion under idealised conditions [Geuss 2004: 33]5) Rawls ends up with a constitutional schema that resembles that of the United States. This egalitarian theory has become more entrenched and influential in the United States 'at the same time as social inequalities in the world increased drastically in almost all industrialized states' (Geuss 2004: 34). In effect, the veil of ignorance is, 'a heuristic tool to get clear about poli- tics by covering up power relations' (Geuss 2008: 90), which draws attention from actual, concrete structures of domination. Geuss warns that the danger in using highly abstractive methods in social and political theory is that one will succeed merely in 'generalizing one's own local prejudices and 'repackaging them' as demands of universal rational intu- ition (2004: 39). Philosophical ethics, abstracted from any historical political context, simply formulates the principles that post-Christian Western Euro- pean 'common sense' uses to propose a series of constraints on action (Geuss 2008: 52). But 'to understand the political world by appealing to "our" intu- itions of what is just is to divert attention from where those intuitions come from, how they're maintained, what interest they serve and the possibility that these intuitions may themselves be ideological' (ibid.: 90). The de-politicisa- tion of the concept of freedom-without-power serves real political purposes. For example, during the South African transition to democracy, powerful social agents abandoned public enterprise as they lost state control. Minority interests were protected by ascendant liberal forms of governance that helped bring down apartheid at the end of the Cold War, with the extension of 'free- market' economic principles to the administration and distribution of health, education, security and other public services. These specific interventions in the economy appear perfectly natural, inevitable, free and fair. But, in this</page><page sequence="8">Blackout: Freedom, without Power 67 context, we should consider Geuss's question: 'do "we" really all believe that giving people with vastly different powers and resources abstractly "equal" rights (and duties, and "opportunities") and abstractly "fair" conditions of interaction will in itself necessarily create a situation that [is] evaluatively attractive?' (ibid.: 91). Unconvinced, private firms predicted the demise of nationalist government and fashioned their own pragmatic black-empower- ment policies in apartheid's final years. Enlightened Distortion Es ist ein Traum; ich will ihn weiter traümen. (Nietzsche 2000: §1)6 I went from having an idealistic view of the law as a password of justice, to a per- ception of the law as a tool used by the ruling class to shape society in a way favourable to itself I never expected justice in court, however much I fought for it, and though I sometimes received it. (Mandela 1994: §39) Ideology does not concern just false beliefs, but also true ones. The phrase, 'Most black South Africans are poorly educated' may be ideological if it involves an epistemic failure to recognise functional relations between (a) con- ditions of domination and (b) beliefs (and social practices), which, in turn, reflect and support these conditions. Ideology affirms the conditions of dom- ination that generate it by suggesting short causal pathways with a strong focus on ends, loading the bulk of responsibility for moral agency on the frontal lobe of the socially and historically constituted individual. Displaced, de-con- textualised abstractions, including projections of freedom and reconciliation, may conceal traumatic conflict by distracting our attention with shallow pre- sentations that mask strained underlying tensions. We project certain features onto the world, focus our attention on them and, in so doing, become alienated from their origins, beholden to conflicts we thereby obscure. In reality, the limit is often not stipulated in advance with direct authority, but is freely deter- mined, in anticipation, by desire. For Nietzsche, every culture is a construct of the human imagination, the foundations of which will not bear inspection (Geuss 2010: 87). However, he is keen to emphasise the positive importance of the exclusion which a culture implies. We need a horizon in order to orientate ourselves, a distinction between what is on this side and on the other - a limit - otherwise our energies become too diffuse (ibid.: 89). From the radically non-anthropocentric per- spective of radical truthfulness, the world just is what it is: a huge, historically and spatially extended brute fact. In fact, from this perspective one starts to wonder what the point is in being truthful (Geuss 1999: 185).7 'Human beings are subject to certain illusions, which they can to some extent see through as illusions, but which are nonetheless utterly necessary for them to continue to live', Geuss agrees with Nietzsche. But the realisation that 'morality is a</page><page sequence="9">68 Christopher Allsobrook human invention, a Schein ', that there is no ultimate ground to our moralities, need not necessarily undermine the binding of the morality in question (Geuss 2010: 95). In fact, one might add, such realisation may help ground our responsibility for what we value. How, then, are we to deal with our 'necessary illusions' (ibid.)? For those in thrall to reified conceptions of their own objective social agency, Nietzsche offers a two-step political and psychological recovery plan: self-denial as a means to self-mastery. He does not dismiss our ethical ideals as false from a supposedly correct, disinterested perspective, but situates them in relation to rival perspectives and relations of power. He recovers the embedded contexts of our values, to criticise claims to normative absolutism with an anachronistic return to descent, in the interests of life in the present. The aim of genealogy is 'to dissolve a certain appearance: concepts that are in common use and pre- sent themselves as self-evidently univocal, internally coherent, well grounded, and rational to use are unmasked as historically contingent conjunctions of diverse ... contradictory semantic components' (Geuss 2010: 87). We 'start with insight into the perversion of the modern world and then look back' (ibid.: 85). Reflective enquiry is directed by problems or frustrations that sur- face through our immersion in the ready-to-hand. Every question of value for Nietzsche is a question of purpose. Thus Niet- zsche substitutes the moral question, 'is this the right way to act, live, feel, etc. for everyone, everywhere, at all times?' with a historically specific evaluative question, 'what are the particular strengths and weaknesses of this form of morality for this person or this group of people at this time?' (Geuss 1999: 178). As a medium of therapy charged with the contextual recuperation of our alienated ideals, genealogy tackles constraints on our capacity for self-gov- ernment imposed by absolutism. From the disillusionment with artifice that accompanies the historical contextualisation of a singular perspective, an enlightened awareness follows, that what we have made we can change. As Owen explains, genealogy: (a) identifies a perspective that holds us captive, which obstructs our self-understanding in ways that matter to us; (b) contrasts this with a plausible, coherent alternative which throws current assumptions into relief; (c) shows how we became captive by our current perspective, and thereby failed in ways to matter to us; and (d) by engaging with our cares and commitments, motivates us to engage in a practical reorientation of ourselves (Owen 2002: 224). Nietzsche's emphasis on the political aspect of ethical and epistemological norms, on widespread social values and socially accepted forms of knowledge, is not only critical but constructive. His genealogies of predominant precon- ceptions affirm and uphold the philosophical tradition of reflective, public engagement with shared principles that govern our lives, in the interests of self-governance: First, Nietzsche does not reject traditional morality, so much as try 'to undercut forms of naivety that characterise traditional discussion in ethics':</page><page sequence="10">Blackout: Freedom, without Power 69 such as the assumption that a given view or form of morality has to be absolutely accepted or rejected, once and for all, for all time and places, and for all people (Geuss 1999: 178). There is nothing intrinsically wrong with projecting shared ideals, so long as their abstract displacement does not distort underlying contexts of struggle, conflict and power, and thereby undermine human agency.8 Freedom as a normative concept, then, has a history that shapes its varying meanings for various individuals, at specific times and places (which is not to say these distinct senses are unrelated; established meanings are hard to shift - hence their stabilising, legitimating role). Second, Nietzsche thinks the concept of freedom is a product of the transpo- sition of the subject-predicate distinction into metaphysics (Geuss 1999: 175):9 a fictional entity posited behind every human activity, as if a free agent stands separate and indifferent from its actions, remaining the same, with alternatives to choose from (ibid.). The idea of 'free self-subjugation under the moral law' is based on belief in a 'neutral, independent "subject"' without whom there are no grounds for morality (Menke 2006: 312). Like Don Quixote, the moral sub- ject separates herself from her impulses and context to follow the law. But absolutist categorical moral norms, abstracted from relations of power, distract us from crucial contextually significant evaluative factors in our lives, alienat- ing us from our powers, thereby undermining human agency. To conceive of liberty as opposed to power and coercion is to misconstrue power and freedom as entities that may be pre-determined prior to interaction. Such hypostatisation of social processes, in turn, lends itself to politically expedient projections of freedom and domination. While Isaiah Berlin's notion of negative liberty rightly recognises the self-undermining moralism that may contradict any positive conception of freedom, positive liberty, as a capacity for self-realisation, or the ability to pursue freely determined ends, is not intrinsically moral. 'Negative freedom', on the other hand, fails to account for enabling, disciplinary aspects of power, realised - through mechanisms of free, rational self-subjugation to the moral law, for example - as voluntary servitude. Presenting activity as substance, and intuitive prejudice as disinter- ested arbitration, the fiction of the neutral, independent 'free subject' of a 'universal morality' supports ongoing political asymmetries by displacing these projections from their contexts of origin and application, weakening social agency by obscuring its political conditions. Euromorphic Ubuntu Humans believe the Gods have human form.

If, following Xenophanes, God is</page><page sequence="11">7 O Christopher A llsobrook anthropomorphic, what of His secular substitute 'Man'? Does this higher level of abstraction, well-constructed man, allow us sufficient critical distance from ourselves to recognise the political artifice of self-determined transcendence? As Max Horkheimer reminds us, 'the black writers of the bourgeoisie' have shown that 'formalistic reason' 'is no more closely allied to morality than to immorality' (Horkheimer and Adorno 1997: 118). Let us misinterpret this phrase. Europe's faded stars, after all, are still visible in Africa at night, though they may appear upside down.10 In Dar es Salaam the bus routes that go down- town have ' ubuntu ' written on them: the core - the head, the heart - of the city, the polis. Having argued, via Plato, for the political character of freedom and having elaborated, via Geuss and Nietzsche, the normative significance of the politi- cal character of freedom, I now first present an account of African ethics that presumes a pre-political conception of humanity. I uncover some problems with the account, in light of the above, and then present an alternative which remedies these problems. Continuing with a soulful Enlightenment tradition of secular subjectivity, where the cogito founds Cartesian epistemology, and Reason grounds Kantian autonomy, Thaddeus Metz presents an elegant philosophical reconstruction of the notion of ubuntu as a normative basis for African moral theory. The prob- lem he aims to remedy is this: In the literature on African ethics, one finds relatively little that consists of norma- tive theorization with regard to right action, that is, the articulation and justification of a comprehensive, basic norm that is intended to account for what all permissible acts have in common as distinct from impermissible ones . . . The field lacks a well- defended principle grounding particular duties. (Metz 2007: 321) Metz seeks a theory of lightness 'that rationally reconstructs primarily those values associated with talk of "Ubuntu" and cognate terms that are prevalent among sub-Saharan Africans'. This African theory of right action is grounded in genuine 'African intuitions' which allow for general moral principles that 'Sub-Saharan Africans ought to believe, given adherence to claims they typi- cally deem to be less controversial than it' (ibid.: 322). Metz describes such work as 'political philosophy not political science', as 'a work of applied ethics'. This is 'a strictly normative enterprise , aimed at justifying certain ... practices by appealing to a principle of right action informed by sub-Saharan values' (Metz 2009: 337; my emphasis).11 Utilitarians ground moral theory on the principle of utility-maximisation, Kantians on the principle of equal respect. In sub-Saharan Africa, Mill's negative, individualistic, liberal princi- ple of personal harm is inverted, with a positive, collectivism communitarian principle of 'social harmony' (ibid.: 343). European man is turned on his head. Africans, more than Westerners, Metz maintains, value (a) consensus over decisions in the face of dissent, (b) restorative justice over redistributive</page><page sequence="12">Blackout: Freedom, without Power 7 1 justice, (c) cooperative over competitive forms of wealth-creation, (d) the dis- tribution of wealth on the basis of needs over distribution according to rights, (e) traditional, communal norms over private values, (f) marriage and family life over an individualistic lifestyle (2007: 324-7). As a white South African it is hard not to concur with this contrast between African and Western intuitions. In fact, I can identify a few others. Africans, more than Westerners, for exam- ple, value (g) a slow, relaxed pace, over punctual hard work beyond the call of duty, and (h) chatting and socialising, over solitary reading and systematically refining moral sentiments. The problematic context of these latter 'intuitions' may be easier to detect.12 Metz's definition of ubuntu may be attributed to the authentic source of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who studied at Pretoria Bantu Normal College, taught at Johannesburg Bantu High School, and resigned, following the pas- sage of the Bantu Education Act in the early 1950s, in protest against conse- quent poor educational prospects for black South Africans, to dedicate his life to the spiritual and political redefinition of both the meaning and the context of Bantu personhood. Tutu says, When we want to give praise to someone we say, ' Yu , u nobuntu 'Hey, so-and-so has Ubuntu Then you are generous, you are hospitable, you are friendly and caring and compassionate. You share what you have. It is to say, 'My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up in yours.' (quoted in Metz 2007: 323) Ubuntu translates roughly through a family of connected phrases: 'I am because we are'; 'we are all connected'; 'we cannot be ourselves without community'; 'a person is a person through other people' (Metz 2007: 323). Ubuntu denotes 'humaneness', personhood, freedom, mind, heart, or soul, the essence of human- ity. Note that personhood here is a value-laden, normative, teleological concept. One only becomes a full person through certain kinds of relations with others. The notion of ubuntu , that 'what is special about human nature is our capacity for harmonious relations', contrasts sharply with the liberal, Kantian notion of autonomy, that what is special about human nature is 'our capacity to make free decisions' (2010: 82-3). For Africans, 'a human being lives a genuinely human way of life insofar as she values harmony and community' (i.e. shared identity, good will and friendly solidarity with other human beings engaged in shared projects of mutual aid and sympathy) (Metz 2007: 338, 2010: 84). Having reconstructed and established this fundamental African ethical prin- ciple of harmony, we can begin to use it to legislate on political and socioeco- nomic practices. From the ideal of ubuntu , the moral principle may be elicited, 'an act is right just insofar as it is a way of prizing harmony with others'. Con- versely, an act is wrong if it fosters division, animosity and discord (Metz 2007: 338-9). Metz argues, for instance, that ubuntu motivates against the death penalty, since, he suggests, with mock understatement, that, like rape, this is 'a serious degradation of a person's capacity for friendly relationships'</page><page sequence="13">72 Christopher Allsobrook (Metz 2010: 94). Sensitive to fine distinctions, however, ubuntu does allow killing in self-defence, to prevent 'a disproportionately unfriendly threat' (ibid.). Ubuntu also supports moderately partial affirmative action and prefer- ential treatment by the state of veterans of the struggle in South Africa, since gratitude and amends foster communal harmony. But strongly partial nepotism violates ubuntu for causing animosity and discord (Metz 2009: 344-9) Metz notes that ubuntu differs from Western ethics in that its fundamental principle of morality is grounded not on something internal to the individual but on relations between individuals (2007: 333). Though he fails to integrate conceptually the political implications of such socially constructed normativ- ity, he is open - in principle - to mediation of the ethical and the political. Let us therefore move on from the indigenous values of African Communitarian- ism - on a Madagascan path of evolutionary development - to the divisive corridors of power behind the liberal-democratic hedge of rational autonomy. Amongst thirsty, pricklier shrubs of ubuntu - following a subversive trail of resistance to slavery and colonialism - we may discover a hybrid strain, mutated through centuries of struggle with the invisible voodoo magic of the Western Imperialist's metaphysical armoury; born of disenchantment with abstract means of exchange and mystical rites of property maintained by the 'pure normative standpoint' of deeply alienated, freely self-disciplined, Euro- pean human subjects. The Meritocratic Privatisation of Apartheid The perfecting of the means of production . . . brings ... the camouflage of the tech- niques by which man is exploited. (Fanon in Turner 2008: 76) Nietzsche believes the 'taste for the unconditional' is 'the worst of all possible tastes', the taste of Slaves, who understand only tyranny and who have a weak stomach for radical liberal tolerance of disorder, complexity, ambiguity and unpredictability (Nietzsche 2008: §31, §46, §59, §198, §199, §221). What say these Slaves' slaves of Liberty? What may the township tour of ubuntu hush up? When ethical norms of ubuntu are consciously mediated with political contexts that shape their significance, perhaps we may then see what the unruly Bantu really thinks of us: There is, in South Africa, an over-riding idea to move towards 'comfortable' politics ... people are shaped by the system even in their consideration of approaches against the system ... If you look at the system managed and run by the National- ists, it's preferable to the system as managed and run by the [Liberal] Progressive Party ... if you were working under a Progressive system, then you would get strat- ification creeping in, with your masses remaining where they are or getting poorer, and your cream of leadership, which is invariably derived from the so-called edu- cated people, beginning to enter the bourgeois ranks . . . (Biko 2008: 41)</page><page sequence="14">Blackout: Freedom, without Power 73 Biko's conception of racism as 'discriminatory subjugation' purposely responds to Verwoerd's justification of apartheid as 'separate development', which, he believes, can only mean 'white domination'. Moreover, this sub- versive definition of racism does not pretend to liberal universality, but is consciously pitched at apartheid. Likewise, his understanding of 'African identity' is not decided aside from political conflict, but is expressed in response to a dominant absolutist interpretation of such identity, formed under conditions domination (More 2008: 50). Biko's 'African identity' is a reaction against attempts to legitimate white domination through control of racial significance, by re-appropriating the term. 'Black' is for Biko a defiant socio-political term, grounded in concrete consciousness of being black in an anti-black world. He writes of Black Consciousness, 'What blacks are doing is merely to respond to a situation in which they find themselves objects of white racism' (Biko in More 2008: 56). For Biko, the tragedy of apartheid is that the victims of this system not only acquiesce in it, but also participate in their own oppression. The language of African philosophy is Greek to me, but if we pay close attention to the genealogy of this radical strain of ubuntu, we may recognise a critical, politicised understanding of humanity in the phrase, 'none of us are free, unless all of us are free'. The social ideal of ubuntu , or African identity, may be said to be critical of the idea that an ethical conception of humanity can be defined prior to any consideration of humans' concrete political histo- ries and circumstances. This critical, emancipatory trope of ubuntu recalls an Aristotelian teleological, normative conception of humanity, as that which becomes what it is through ongoing political participation in the public matter of self-governance. The sovereign human being cannot recognise herself in discrete abstraction from the determinate, agonistic social contexts in which her humanity is freely formed. Whereas Metz's timeless, neo-Kantian, communitarian, ethics-first account of ubuntu fits well with the Archbishop Tutu's generous, dignified Christian interpretation (transcendent, 'Tutubuntu'), Biko's radically insolent existen- tialist account of African identity (immanent, 'Bikobuntu') is expressly his- torically contingent, and overtly political, with respect to its origins and aims (Table 1). Consider, then, South Africa's Justice Mogoeng, who, in his dissenting judgement, in the Constitutional case of The Citizen v McBride , stated that it was impermissible to use truthful acts (calling McBride a 'murderer') to insult the dignity of a self-confessed human-rights violator. Mogoeng described this attribution 'an attack on traditional values that should not be allowed'. Later, in his application for the Supreme Court bid, Mogoeng listed this minority judgement as one of his most valuable contributions to the law, as it 'creates a balance between freedom of expression and the right to dignity, especially when taking note of ubuntu' (Biko 201 1, Die Beeld , 26 August 201 1).</page><page sequence="15">74 Christopher Allsobrook Table 1: Tutu-buntu and Biko-buntu TRANSCENDENT TUTUBUNTU IMMANENT BIKOBUNTU Humanity is a collective good Blacks' humanity is dominated by whites My humanity is bound up in yours Blacks must fight to regain self-respect An act is just if it prizes harmony Harmony in present conditions is unjust African values are intrinsically valuable Blacks must fashion their own authentic values Note that not all of the sets of contrasted value statements in Table 1 are incompatible; one or two may even imply one another. Yet the recognition, in the latter category, that human freedom is historically politically embedded, is crucial. One may recall, in 1992, near the end of apartheid government, the flatulent deflation of the discomforting pressure of traditional Afrikaner racism, when the leader of the AWB , Eugene Terre'Blanche, suffered the supreme indignity of rearing up on his horse at a right-wing rally and falling off its back end onto his own. This humiliating image of conservative community values is com- memorated in South Africa's satirical annals. Our epic record of domination gives plenty of reason to re-evaluate and to contest the value of our traditions, through the lessons of the past, in the interests of life in the present. A balance - between individual and collective freedoms - established from (a) a pure normative standpoint, is no less politically loaded than (b) a publically nego- tiated settlement. The latter, however, invites contested representation of the good, in the interest thereof, which the former stipulates in advance. Acknowledging the political dimension of collective freedom - the other side of individual freedom - Nelson Mandela states in his defence at the Rivo- nia Trial, 'To be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others' (1994: 617). Three decades later, after his release, he writes in his autobiography, I knew as well as I knew anything that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away another man's freedom is a prisoner of hatred . . . my mission was to liberate the oppressed and the oppressor both. Some say this has now been achieved. But ... the truth is that we are not yet free; we have merely achieved the freedom to be free; the right not to be oppressed. (1994: 751) Mandela acknowledges that formal freedom from de jure oppression, won for every South African in 1994, is only the first step towards an ideal collective solidarity, whereby we recognise our freedom by respecting and enhancing the freedom of others. Such negotiation of individual and collective interests - power - is managed by rational political interaction or by force. Worryingly, political freedom, won with the fall of the Iron Curtain, is increasingly nar- rowly constrained by the hidden hand of the market.</page><page sequence="16">Blackout: Freedom, without Power 75 Meritocratic Freedom Liberal faith, in de-regulated markets and minimal state interference, appeals to a common intuition that society should incentivise individual determination, innovation and hard work, and discourage incompetence, protectionism and indolence. The 'trickle-down' argument for highly differential salary scales and fantastic bonuses in the financial sector, for example, is backed by wide- spread public support for 'meritocracy', over the entrenched privileges of monarchy, aristocracy or theocracy, for example. Status attached to noble birth-right is perceived as an unfair reward for an arbitrary accident. The con- sensus is we should reward people, not for having the right parents, but for their own individual achievements. This, in turn, underpins dominant faith in free markets and the minimal state. A misconception which helps the 'trickle-down' argument for inequality is that, unlike aristocracy, 'meritocracy' is incompatible with entrenched privi- lege. But Higher Education can act as an arcane set of exclusionary rules and intellectual discourses akin to Victorian table manners or courtly etiquette, which function not only by way of short-hand concepts for complex ideas shared by colleagues engaged in specialist research, but as a shibboleth, to identify guild members and ward off competition, in cryptic analytics, or para- doxical post-modernese.13 The same may be said of arcane mathematical equa- tions used to construct complex financial mechanisms that reaped soaring profits for those in the know by hiding from investors, auditors and regulators highly leveraged risks that produced the current global economic crisis. One's education has increasingly become an index of inherited privilege, like the fair skin used to protect Afrikaner socialists' wages from non- White labour after the Anglo-Boer War. Such protectionism is not a trait that is unique to Afrikaners in South Africa. Many firms only included Afrikaans executives on their boards when the Nationalists won power. Despite mass unemployment, with a severe skills shortage, the country battles to compete on the global market. A leading employment institution attributes the 286.4 per cent salary inflation at the top of the jobs market, since 2000, to a skills shortage induced artificially by the notoriously inflexible, protectionist Immi- grations Act of 2002 (New Age 20 1 1 ). Educated South Africans are sitting on a goldmine. The idea of external, repressive power, set in opposition to a pre-political concept of Freedom, obscures internalisation of disciplinary coercion. Whereas teenagers of 1976 knew their enemy, today's impoverished young South Africans are given the impression that they are free already and, hence, responsible for their own misfortune. Progressing from age-old economic sys- tems of ancestry, meritocracy is supposed to prevent monopolisation by ensur- ing that those at the top earn their position through what they provide for the common good, or market. This, in any case, is how high-earning financial executives report their bonuses. Yet most South Africans are barred from</page><page sequence="17">76 Christopher Allsobrook access to the country's resources at birth, particularly through the heavily imbalanced education system. Education is a commodity bought, sold on the market in various grades of quality, distributed according to socio-economic status, along with health, longevity, security and even beauty, if not yet love. Under such processes of commodification, liberal meritocracy has become a dominant ideology for our time, valuable not just for fostering excellence in the economy through competition, but also to elites, for presenting a de-contextualised, fictive Free- dom, abstracted from conditions of domination that determine educational status and skills through the function of the residential post-code. The self- made proletarian millionaire who decries 'worthless' university degrees he did not need, claiming sole responsibility for success, misses the education that may reveal to him the statistical lottery that earned him his status. A for- mal conception of liberty, discretely abstracted from political conditions of freedom, complicitly obscures structural conditions of domination. South Africa is liberated, in the sense of freedom-from-legislated-coercion. Our constitution is designed to protect each individual from domination. Such legislative freedom to pursue our own freely defined ends fails, however, to address power imbalances inherited from apartheid, particularly in education. The idea that human freedom is politically constituted illuminates problems faced today that are obscured by a reified conception of Freedom, which dis- guises entrenched privileges by displacing them, on the other side of a mysti- fied cosmopolitan rainbow nation. The freedom of those without money or skills to get ahead has not been secured, for what is freedom without power? A formal liberal or republican conception of freedom fails to recognise, 'pol- itics is at work in the illusion of transcending particularity' (Gordon 2008: 90). Biko's rejection of a strictly normative, pre-political conception of col- lective human freedom insists, with ubuntu , amandla awethu14.

'Ideology' is understood here in a critical sense, as a shared set of interrelated ideas, values, norms, beliefs, desires and so forth, belonging to a group of people, which supports rela- tions of domination by suggesting interpretations, of social reality, which mask, obscure or disguise significant causal relations. 2. Marx writes here that the Young Hegelians 'fight phrases with phrases' and 'neglect the real chains of men'. 3. This warns against later materialistic distortions of Marx in 'scientific socialism'. 4. This pattern of reification is typical of transitions from the saying to the said. 5. Even when conditions are nullified, terms and conditions apply. 6. Translated: 'It is a dream; I wish to dream further', or, as Peggy Lee and, later, P. J. Harvey sing, in a song inspired by Thomas Mann's Enttäuschung , 'If that's all there is, my friend, then let's keep dancing'. 7. This, I take it, is the crucial issue of Third Essay of the Genealogy of Morals. The will to truth, having consumed its false foundations in religion and science, has to face the value of its own groundless ground. 8. Hegel reminds us that the danger with overbearing categories that subsume particular qual- ities is that we may mistake experience we project into the world for a new understanding of something outside ourselves. 9. See also Nietzsche (2008: 17, 2009:13). 10. Hesperus is Phosphorus, so to speak. 1 1 . Note that the use of 'political philosophy' here may neglect the work of a 'motley crew' of radical and conservative thinkers who find strictly normative enterprises inimical to politi- cal theory. 12. Given the sensitive context surrounding these remarks, the reader should note an implicit criticism of the racist stereotypes used to emphasise the ideological subtext behind these commonly held South African 'intuitions'. 13. The irony here is inadvertent and, perhaps, unfortunate. 14. " Amandla awethu" (Xhosa/Zulu) = "Power to the people" (a traditional South African rally cry) References Biko, S. 2008.
