<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHAT THE MERCHANT-GURU SOLD: SOCIAL AND LITERARY TYPES IN HINDI DEVOTIONAL VERSE DANIEL GOLD CORNELL UNIVERSITY The sants of North India were devotional poet-singers who emerged in the fifteenth century from the lowest Indian social strata; by the eighteenth century, however, they also included many figures from middle Hindu castes. Characteristically rejecting the sanctity of the orthodox mythic images found in much Hindu devotional poetry, the sants had frequent recourse to images from mundane life. In their poetry, they transformed these images into types with broad universal meaning that un- dermined the religious significance of conventional Hindu social roles. To do this they often used yogic terms in literary ways. Although the sants' transformation of mundane images is a regular fea- ture of their verse, its socioreligious significance changes with the sants' changing social status. The implication of the merchant imagery in songs by Paltii, an eighteenth-century poet from a trading caste, thus differs from that of corresponding images of earlier sants. IN UNDERSTANDING THEIR SOCIETY, LITERATURE, and reli- gion, traditional Hindu thinkers have given serious at- tention to conventional types. Indeed, the subtle conventions of culture were understood to derive from organic patterns of nature, and trueness to type has often been an important measure of intrinsic worth. In the classical literature of India the sanctified Hindu cul- tural world has been depicted through refined conven- tions of verbal representation. Social roles are explicit-with righteous, if headstrong, kings; moralis- tic, sometimes taciturn ascetics; voluptuous women and their passionate suitors. Literary forms seek to give these roles some novel development while keeping them within their established bounds: lyric verse de- lights in embellishing highly stylized scenes; dramas re- solve temporary confusions among idealized characters into happy conclusions. Through classical literature, the educated audience savors a refined representation of types playing out their destined roles in a familiar, es- tablished order.1 What then happens to the world of traditional types in literatures of the Indian underclasses, created by uneducated composers who frequently had little use for the established order? There were more of such litera- tures than might at first be suspected. Many of the ver- nacular devotional literatures of India have roots among the disenfranchised classes, although they have usually been absorbed into mainstream Hindu tradition. Certainly, the forceful and vehement language with which several of the early devotional poets explicitly rejected the familiar Hindu socio-religious hierarchy was noted by some of the first scholars who treated the vernacular texts (Westcott 1907: 17-25, Hunashal 1947: 122-29, cf. Ranade 1983: 183-210). Recent lit- erary studies of these texts have further revealed more subtle rhetorical play in them, although not all of it overtly socio-religious (Bryant 1978, Cutler 1987, Hawley 1984, Hess 1983, Ramanujan 1973). In the verses of the Hindi sants, however, some of the most outspokenly iconoclastic of the devotional poets, we can find a rhetoric that does have an overt socio- religious implication-indeed, one that frequently un- dermines the very idea of sanctified type itself. Although almost any devotee can be styled a sant in Hindi, the term is also used to refer to a particular, broad religious tradition that has developed along some recognizable lines of its own (Schomer 1987: 6). From the 15th century to the 18th, sants flourished through- out North India, and verses in sant style continue to be written today. Indeed, these verses-known as sant bani, "the sant's sayings"-in their spread and sheer volume appear as one of the major broad genres of pre- modern Hindi poetry. Several of the greatest early sants stood at the very bottom of the Hindu socio-religious order: Kabir-the best known of them all-was a l Valuable treatments of Sanskrit drama are found in the in- troductions to van Buitenen 1968: 3-30 and Miller 1984: 1- 88 (including essays by Miller, David Gitomer, and Edwin Gerow). The introduction to Ingalls' anthology remains a clas- sic treatment of Sanskrit verse. 22</page><page sequence="2">GOLD: What the Merchant-Guru Sold 23 weaver, Ravidas a tanner, and Dadu a cotton carder. With first-hand knowledge of the problems of Hindu hierarchy, they sometimes embedded their devotional directives in an overt critique of established ritual ob- servance. Particularly intense and explicit was the rhet- oric of Kabir himself (see Hess 1983), whose message is sometimes portrayed as revolutionary-in a reli- gious, if not a political sense (Lorenzen 1981, 1987). Thus, in the following verses, Kabir presents both brahmins and qazis (whom he takes as their Muslim counterparts) as sanctimonious hypocrites-neither know the reality of Ram, the true Lord within: On the eleventh day of each fortnight the brahmin doesn't eat; The qazi fasts the month of Ramadan. Pray tell me why eleven months are empty, while one month is replete? And if God only lives in mosques whose land lies in between? Can Ram reside in images and pilgrims' stops- in neither one has he been seen.2 Nevertheless, the sants were not for the downtrodden alone. In offering a universalistic piety particularly ac- cessible to the low-born but potentially appealing to all, the sants would always attract a mixed socio- religious constituency. Over time, moreover, the spiri- tual stature of the great early poets heightened the re- spectability of the movement as a whole. Thus, among the lists of generally low-born early sants "Raja" Pipa appears as a significant exception, but eventually a number of important gurus began to arise from Hindu mercantile communities: Guru Nanak in the sixteenth century; in the eighteenth, Charandas and Paltu. The socio-religious egalitarianism that was a regular feature of sant piety thus increasingly reflected less a lower- caste rejection of Hindu hierarchical norms than a middle-caste acceptance of a particular Hindu identity.3 This transformation of the socio-religious milieu of the sant poets warrants a more serious historical treat- ment of sant verse than either traditional Hindu or modern Western scholarship has usually given to Indian literary genres. Hindus have traditionally seen their types as eternal and immutable, which tend to translate into Western academic terms as categories of a synchronic, static sort. These can be most apt for treatments of Sanskrit classical literature, the genres of which are surprisingly homogeneous across time (Lien- hard 1984: 48). But in the vernacular literatures in which genres like the sant bani flourished, specific lit- erary forms have often been bound closely to particular religious movements, which themselves might change significantly over the centuries. New voices found au- thority in the old conventions, but the latter were them- selves transformed by the new religious meanings they now held. Nevertheless, despite their changes over time, the verses of the sants are all still generally understood to reflect a piety referred to in Hindi as nirguna bhakti- devotion to a divinity "without qualities."4 This piety is contrasted by both scholars and devotees to saguna bhakti-devotion to a divinity "with qualities," nor- mally personified in a mythic image that can be cere- monially worshipped and poetically described. The fit between particular religious movements and the types of piety expressed in the verse associated with them, of course, is not exact, and the sentiments revealed by po- ets of primarily iconic or aniconic vision sometimes overlap. As Kabir refers above to the Lord as Ram, sants frequently extoll the names of mythic divinities, if not their images; conversely, poets who normally elaborate on the mythic exploits of Ram or Krishna at times also express the inward contrition found among sants (Hawley 1984: 121-60). Still, on the whole, verse oriented toward these different types of devotion are preserved in different textual canons, and in their more typical forms evoke distinctive religious experi- ences through characteristic rhetorical strategies. I will begin by examining some problems of nirguna bhakti itself, a concept that has puzzled some scholars and escaped the attention of more. I will then approach the interplay of social and literary type in sant verse by contrasting it to that of the Krishnaite poets broadly contemporaneous with them. For although movements of both nirguna and saguna bhakti existed together in North India from about the fifteenth century on, their leaderships came from contrasting strata of society, 2 From song 177 of Tivdri's text (1961: 103), my transla- tion. 3 On the sants in general see Schomer and McLeod 1987, and Gold 1987a.

Hawley 1988 presents valuable insights about the meaning of the authorship in Hindi devotional songs, including sant bani. 4 Indeed, the sant bani are the major literary vehicle of nir- guna bhakti-the other important one being the devotional songs that come down through traditions of NMths and Jogis. Ndth songs in Hindi have been collected by Barthwal (1971). On the use of such songs in current traditions see Gold and Gold (1984).</page><page sequence="3">24 Journal of the American Oriental Society 112.1 (1992) and the verses these took as scripture offered alterna- tive socio-religious resolutions to devotees' existential predicaments. The different use of literary types in the two schools will be explored through a contrast be- tween some verses of Kabir and SUrdas, the foremost poet of Krishna devotion in Hindi. To examine the ad- justment of sant rhetoric to its later socio-religious context, Kabir will then be compared to an eighteenth- century sant from a mercantile caste, PaltO, who devel- ops the image of the guru himself as merchant offering diverse spiritual goods. Historically considered, the re- ligious quality of these goods reflects the transforma- tion of sant tradition over three centuries. In their syn- chronic diversity, however, they also reveal some of the religious potencies of the song form itself as a last- ing vehicle for sant devotion. In my argument, I will focus on two features of sant literary language: its frequent recourse to mundane, everyday images, and its use of yogic terms. The re- course to mundane images is a feature common to songs of both nirguna and saguna bhakti as popular lit- erature-in contrast to the elegant, consciously ele- vated descriptions of classical verse. I will thus be examining the different rhetorical uses of mundane im- ages in the two devotional schools. Yogic terms are used primarily by poets of nirguna bhakti and only rarely by those of Krishna devotion. But since the nir- guna poets Kabir and PaltO differ in their literary use of yogic terms, these are able instead to highlight the historical changes within sant tradition. The argument I will finally put forward has three as- pects-socio-religious, literary, and historical. I will argue that a frequent strategy in the verse of the sants is the transformation of mundane images into types with broad universal meaning that undermine the reli- gious significance of conventional Hindu social roles. This will entail an exploration of some socio-religious implications of what the philosopher and critic Philip Wheelwright once called "the archetypal imagination" (1968: 50-55). I will further argue that this transfor- mation from image to archetype is accomplished in part through a literary use of esoteric terms, which for a popular audience ignorant of yogic practice can sug- gest mysterious meanings in what had seemed familiar realities. I will maintain, however, that the different au- diences of Kabir and PaltOW lived in socio-historical contexts that led them to develop these new meanings in alternative directions. THE PROBLEM OF NIRGUNA BHAKTI Taken literally, the term nirguna bhakti presents an oxymoron. How can "devotion" (bhakti) be offered to an object that is "without qualities" (nirguna)? For if devotion implies both attraction and submission, then its object must at least have the "qualities" of attrac- tiveness and superiority. And in Vedanta, the nirguna Brahman is contrasted to the saguna as a most imper- sonal and impassive absolute. Thus, Sanskrit scholars commenting on the sants' nirguna bhakti have de- scribed it as an example of illegitimate philosophizing by the ignorant5 or as "a concoction of monistic schol- ars, artificially imposed on sant tradition" (O'Flaherty 1987: 47). Certainly, the concept of nirguna bhakti found among sants does develop out of the interaction of "higher" Sanskritic and "lower" vernacular tradi- tions. Yet instead of being imposed from above, it seems more likely to have been commandeered by the popular ranks below. For the notion of nirguna bhakti that evolved in sant tradition was able to address some legitimate intellectual needs faced by reflective devo- tees in a pluralistic Indian religious environment. Many sources indeed contributed to the efflorescence of sant piety in fifteenth-century North India. From as early as the thirteenth century, sants in Maharashtra had synthesized growing Vaishnava devotional wor- ship with a pre-existent tradition of popular yoga ori- ented toward Shiva. The result in Maharashtra was an expansive, inclusive tradition that found predecessors in legendary yogis called Naths while also promoting the worship of the Vaishnava image of Vitthala at Pan- dharpur (Vaudeville 1987).6 Like the Hindi sant-poets, those in Maharashtra did not characteristically present detailed anthropomorphic images of divinity in their verse (Zelliot 1987: 35-51), but they were freer than most Hindi sants in mixing iconic and aniconic forms of practice. Finding precedent in the inclusive piety of the Maharashtrian sants (Gold 1987a: 14, 222), the sant tradition developing on the northern plains also came into contact with two more traditions, both of which contributed to its more restrictive devotional focus. First, the prevalence of ecstatic and increasingly sec- tarian forms of iconic Krishna devotion motivated the Hindi sants at once to specify, in contrast, their ani- conic ideals and to develop their own forms of ecstatic devotion. Second, and perhaps more important, the im- posing presence of Islam in the north gave the sants a more specific socio-religious role, and through its Sufi mystics, provided new models of piety. 5 A bhakta may indulge, but not in panditya (Staal 1987: 46). 6 The image of Vitthala itself may have Shaivite origins (Vaudeville 1987: 223).</page><page sequence="4">GOLD: What the Merchant-Guru Sold 25 In a world experiencing the impact of Hindu and Is- lamic worldviews-each distinct and each a totality- the concept of a Lord who is not to be envisioned in any form, Hindu or Islamic, has a positive value of its own. Moreover, a passionate attachment to just such a divinity was espoused by many Indian Sufis-with whom Kabir and Daddi, both born Muslims, could very conceivably have come into contact early in their spiri- tual careers. Indeed, Hindi sant piety presents closer structural parallels to strands in Indian Sufism than to any other form of Indian mysticism contemporary with it (Gold 1987a: 201-13). Thus, despite the oxymoron of niguna bhakti, it may be more readily graspable by scholars conversant with Western monotheisms than many other Hindu mystical strains. Indeed, whatever incompatibilities may once have existed among the varied elements of the Hindi sant tradition, the sants brought them together into a vital working synthesis. The internal contradictions presented by the concept of nirguna bhakti, then, lie primarily in the term etymo- logically understood, not in its historical referent among sants. In this case, the term nirguna itself must have a different meaning in sant devotion than it does in Hindu philosophy: just what is meant in Hindi by de- votion to a divinity "without qualities"? Throughout sant tradition, poets have described the ultimate state through negatives: No foundation for the temple there, no body for the god- Where Kabir lingers in service to the one who can't be seen. (Kabir 9:13)7 Kabir's description of the ultimate divine state is elab- orated by Gulal Sahib, a seventeenth-century sant in the lineage from which PaltU would emerge. Through a logic more prosaic than Kabir's, Gulal shows how any description of the divine in negative terms can contrib- ute to the sant's undermining of classical Hindu norms. Gulal here denies the ultimacy of both the great Hindu Gods (the "three Devs") and Brahmanic scripture (the "four Vedas"): No shape there, no outline; no caste there, no rank: There dwells the indestructible, the formless.... No moon, no sun, no night, no day, Nor three Devs nor four Vedas ... (Mahitmdorh ki Bani 33) In addition to making negative assertions about the ul- timate state, Gulal, like many other sants and philoso- phers, also gives it negative attributes-frequently, as here, through negatively affixed adjectives used as nouns: the "indestructible" (aksai) and "formless" (amfirti). The term nirguna itself as this sort of negative at- tribute, however, seems to have been first used in Hindi verse not by sants but by devotees of Krishna. There, moreover, it is also affectively negative, refer- ring to a dry meditative goal that is spurned by the true devotee. In a series of Siurdas' verses known as "songs to the bee," Krishna's devotees taunt his foolish friend Uddhav, who tries to teach them yoga and meditation in Krishna's absence (thus proving to be a noisy and painful annoyance like a bee). The devotees' mocking questions imply that to those already enraptured by the incarnate divinity, even contemplating the nirguna (pronounced nirgun in Hindi) is simply inconceivable: What land does nirgun live in, bee?.... Who's his dad and who's his mum? His wife and maid are who? If you try to tell us tales they'll come back to haunt you! What's his color? What does he wear? What pleasures does he take? Unbalanced, silent, Uddhav listens: Slur thinks his brain might break. (4250)8 Indeed, how could this unimaginable divinity possibly supplant the palpable presence of captivating Krishna, delightful to see and hear?: How can we erase that smile from our hearts, that glance that gives us pleasure? Yogic means, release-the highest holy treasure- we offer to his flute. In what way can the nirgun come to live in hearts that know those lotus eyes of his? (4240) By the eighteenth century, the distinction between saguna and nirguna appears in the verse of Charandas of Delhi, a sant more conversant with classical tradi- tion than most. The technical philosophical contrast with which Charandas begins, however, is transcended in a devotional paean to the one Lord: 7 All references to Kabir's couplets refer to the numberings in Tivari's text; the translations are my own. 8 All references to S!urdqs refer to the numberings in the MNgari Pracdrini Sabha edition of the Sar Sdgar; the transla- tions are my own.</page><page sequence="5">26 Journal of the American Oriental Society 112.1 (1992) He's nirgun and he's sagun, He's different from them both. Who he was I never knew however much I pondered. Endless power, endless play, virtues of all kinds, A spectacle of endless shapes to which Charandas gives offerings. (Charandds 1966: 177) Although Charandas was atypical among sants in his openness to Krishna devotion as well as in his familiar- ity with classical letters, his literateness and catholicity may have nevertheless helped him articulate in recog- nizable Hindu terms a vision of the Lord that seems to have resonated widely among other sants as well. His object of devotion, he tells us in the passage above, is in fact not simply nirguna in the classical philosophi- cal sense, just as it is not simply saguna either. It is, rather, simply unlimited. The logical and psychological contradictions suggested by the concept of nirguna bhakti thus dissolve in a vision of the divine that in containing all qualities can appear to have none grasp- able by human perception at all: instead of facing a di- vinity with absolutely no attributes, the devotee here faces "a spectacle of endless shapes" with "virtues of all kinds" that certainly inspire the attraction and hu- mility necessary for devotion. Thus, as an object of de- votion, the sants' divinity "without qualities" becomes a sort of wondrous divine person who contains and sur- passes any specific Hindu deity: "the one who can't be seen" to whom "Kabir lingers in service"-whom Charandas "never knew" but to whom he still "gives offerings." This Lord is nirguna not in any absolute philosophical sense, but relatively nirguna, in explicit sectarian contrast to the Lord appearing in the specific iconic forms of Ram or Krishna. This devotional sense of nirguna seems to have emerged as devotees drawn from an increasingly middle-caste Hindu milieu applied the well-known philosophical distinctions between nirguna and saguna to a new religious field. As normally occurs throughout the history of religions, they adapted the traditions they inherited to the problems they had at hand. In doing so they gave a more specific sense to the meaning of guna, "quality." Here the gunas of the nirguna/saguna distinction denote not abstract virtues (which the Lord "without qualities" may be felt to possess) but the specific iconic attributes of popular, usually Vaishnav- ite, deities. The contrast between a Vaishnavite Lord conceived in definite, mythological terms and the yogi's Lord who has no specific shape is recognized widely in rural North India, where ordinary villagers may use the sa- guna/nirguna distinction to refer to the two major classes of popular devotional verse (A. G. Gold 1988: 102; Henry 1988: 161). The two sorts of song are likely to be performed in separate groups with distinct sectar- ian affiliations and be understood to convey different religious feeling (bhiva). The verses of nirguna bhakti, as we shall see, often employ a rhetoric that works by developing individual images from the "spectacle of endless shapes" reflecting ultimate reality-a spectacle that itself appears more socio-religiously complex over the centuries. IMAGINATION AND TRADITION As pre-modern Hindi poetry, the literatures of sa- guna and nirguna bhakti share some common features. Not only was the preponderant form in both traditions the short separable song, but in both the broad practical uses of the songs are similarly manifold: they are per- formed by specialists, chanted communally on special occasions, and resonate in the memory of the devotee. Yet the characteristic subject of the saguna poetry is more circumscribed: lovingly described moments in the life of the incarnate Lord and his devotees. That of the sant poets is necessarily more abstract and varied. Section headings in collections of sant verse include "admonition" (cetavni), a warning about human mor- tality and the transitoriness of the world; and "humil- ity" (vinaya), the smallness of individuals in the face of the Lord. There are also verses that tell of inward "experience" (anubhav) and esoteric "secrets" (bhed). The differences in scope of the two classes of devo- tional song give them different places in the sectarian traditions that grew up around them. In established movements of Krishna devotion the songs provide a crucial emotive element to traditions that included elaborate texts and rituals. Thus, the evocative power of the Hindi verse is given intellectual support by an extensive literature in Sanskrit written by a leadership who were mostly brahmins.9 By contrast, leaders in movements around sants have, for the most part, not been brahmins, and until the last century have largely been innocent of Sanskrit.10 Hindi verse thus also be- 9 Vallabhdcdrya, the founder of the pustimdrg, was a brah- min who wrote treatises in Sanskrit; see Redington's transla- tion (1983). Hereditary leadership continued in his biological line. On the brilliant brahmin theologians of Bengali Vai- snavism see De 1961: 111-65. 10 Exceptions include Bhikha and Govind, who composed some works in Sanskrit (see Gold 1988: 44-49). Later Kabir-</page><page sequence="6">GOLD: What the Merchant-Guru Sold 27 came a medium for presenting some of the abstract and yogic elements of tradition. Mundane Language and Literary Type Although later sant treatises11 sometimes read as if they were puranic texts written in Hindi, straightfor- ward verse narratives on cosmological topics with little poetic adornment, in the sants' songs and couplets ab- stract understandings are sometimes presented in a poetry that can speak powerfully to the common reli- gious sensibilities of ordinary people. An impenetrable metaphysical truth is expressed through an everyday image: The ice took shape from water and then dissolved away. Whatever was has become Him: What more now can I say? (Kabir 9:9) An arcane esoteric experience is articulated as poetic vision: Kabir sees a bright shining lotus, a spotless, risen sun. Night's darkness disappears: he hears the horn of unstruck sound. (Kabir 9:36) Here the yogic references-lotuses, suns, and unstruck sound-like the images of ice and water above, sug- gest the dimensions of a divine reality that cannot itself be concretely visualized. In communicating religious experiences, the poets of Krishna devotion have a task that seems more straight- forward, if just as artful. Through descriptions of the play of the Lord and his devotees in his charmed child- hood home in Vraj country, they try to draw their lis- teners into a vivid mythic world. Participating in Krishna's heaven on earth, an audience could experi- ence the image of the captivating Lord as a vivid per- sonal reality. Thus, most of the songs center on an image of Krishna himself, often in play with the enrap- tured young women of Vraj. In songs of Krishna devo- tion, flashes of everyday reality help bring stylized scenes of the Lord's play into the experience of ordi- nary devotees: In every house in Vraj they've started talking: [refrain] "Hari's stealing curds and butter Then eats it with his cowherd friends." The women of Vraj are delighted to hear this: "Maybe he'll come to my house; I could creep up on him, as he eats butter, And press him to my breast." This is their desire deep within: the thought all their hearts keep. Even if he were to take it away, says Surdds, They'd give the Lord butter to eat. (Sursdgar 890) This song begins abstractly, with a straightforward statement about Krishna's butter-stealing, a stock scene in the childhood myths. Eventually, it adorns the scene with some vivid physical images: "I could creep up on him...." The real power of this song, however, seems to lie in the naive ambivalence of the devotees' emo- tions, at once generous and selfish: although they would give the Lord butter "even if he were to take it away..." the first reaction of each is "maybe he'll come to my house." Intense and complex emotions are expressed through simple, familiar expressions. Not pointing beyond itself, as in sant verse, mundane lan- guage is used in the poetry of Krishna devotion to present a highly charged mythic world as unmistakably real in earthly terms (see Hawley 1983: 99-161). These different ways in which Kabjr and SUrdas use mundane images to express religious experience corre- spond nicely to two of the "ways of imagination" de- scribed by Philip Wheelwright, a philosopher of wide ranging interests who wrote in the fifties and sixties about symbolic language (1968: 32-55). In discussing the creative processes through which poets fashion their subject matter into literature, Wheelwright de- scribes both the "confrontative" and the "archetypal" imagination. The confrontative imagination plays with specifics, drawing out the particular meanings of con- crete details. As in the verses of Surdas, it hones in close upon an individual scene, attempting to achieve some vivid, felt intensity of experience. The arche- typal imagination, on the other hand, sees in the indi- vidual example universal dimensions, high and deep. It brings the whole into focus around any telling de- tail, and as in Kabir's couplets, can make ordinary im- ages profound.12 panthI authors have studied Sanskrit and translated some of their own works into the language (Keay 1931: 134). 1l These include Kabirpanthi texts (surveyed by Keay 1931: 112-34) and some longer works by Tulsi Sdhib. 12 Gold (1987b: 412) takes Wheelwright's modes to some dynamics of writing on religion. They have also been recently used by Scott.</page><page sequence="7">28 Journal of the American Oriental Society 112.1 (1992) Both of these modes of imagination, moreover, are contrasted by Wheelwright to a third mode, the "stylis- tic," which in fact seems to be central to classical Hindu aesthetics. The stylistic imagination characteris- tically distances and stylizes its object (Wheelwright 1968: 33), just as in Indian dramatic theory a play is taken as an idealized representation of worldly life-a refined form to be savored by a contemplative audience (Gerow 1977: 264-68). Later classical poets were apt to take already stylized scenes, like those of Krishna and the milkmaids, and embellish them through further ornamentation. Indeed, Hindi classical poetry of the Riti KMI (1650-1850) takes the play of Krishna as the setting for the refined expression of erotic love of an explicitly worldly, unreligious nature. Surdas, how- ever, composed for an audience whose implicit arche- typical awareness of Krishna was already heightened, one ready to believe that Krishna's youthful antics pre- sented images of heavenly play and passion. Through confronting the familiar particulars of his scene SUrdas revivifies the archetype, converting a normative, styl- ized cultural model into a personal divine reality. The poetic imagination of the sants, by contrast, is constrained by their religious iconoclasm. Not only did the sants worship the Lord beyond Form, many of the most important ridiculed the Hindu deities together with brahminic tradition. Denying themselves the re- sources of Hindu mythology, the sants had to find larger meanings in more mundane images. These did not present themselves primarily to the sants' confron- tative imagination, in full detail, to be developed in particularity. Instead, they were transformed into ar- chetypes. As in Kabir's treatment of ice and water, the sants tried to reveal eternal spiritual truths in everyday experience, and convert familiar particulars into pro- found universal types. Archetypes and Egalitarianism The different dynamics of imagination found in the poetry of saguna and nirguna bhakti reflect the differ- ent socio-religious roles of the poets in the two tradi- tions. In both traditions, poets appear as inspired human beings, but the nature of their inspiration stands in different relation to established religious authority. The poets of Krishna devotion describing their encoun- ter with the Lord reenforce a vision already sanctified by established Hindu tradition. There great poets had long been understood as seers recording their experi- ences of a traditionally conceived world. Indeed, poets of Krishna devotion were sometimes understood by theologians to be themselves living internally at the Lord's court, and their songs reenacting divine play on earth. Their imaginative vision could thus be inter- preted in tradition as a literal representation of higher divine realities. Their detailed confrontation of particu- lars makes their conventional picture seem all the more trustworthy. The imaginative vision of the sants, on the other hand, was at once more indirect and more unset- tling. Although the internal yogic experiences recorded by sants may have been understood to be just as genu- ine as those recorded by devotees of Krishna, their poetry depended more on consciously elaborated figures and witty phrasings than vivid evocation of a scene. Not understood to work as a revealed expression of heavenly vision, poetic imagination would instead often embed a religious message in a critique of social norms. Turning particulars into archetypes entailed giving them new meanings, which could be unexpected and socio-religiously jarring. If the poets of Krishna devotion enlivened old mythic realities, the sant poets were liable to puncture those myths with barbs of unor- thodox truth. In questioning the established order, moreover, the sants did not restrict themselves to overt criticisms of hypocritical observance among the privileged classes. They could also play on the socio-religious identity of listeners from low status occupations: You won't be overlooked, fish: the fisherman is death. Though you go round to all the ponds, in each he's set his net. (Kabir 16:7) When they see the gardener come the buds make a loud fuss: "The flowers in bloom have all been picked- tomorrow's time for us!" (Kabir 16:34) Death personified in the image of the fisherman and the gardener gives the images of these normally humble caste groups an ominous authority. If, like death, they had always been polluting for high-caste Hindus, they now appear powerful like death, too. Thus, using these low-caste images as archetypes here does not so much destroy their earlier connotations as augment them. In- deed, presented from the point of view of their living victims, the fisherman and gardener appear as merci- less, grim figures. The couplets might then also pro- voke members of these low-caste groups-who were likely to be in Kabir's audience-to see themselves in a new and not so attractive light. Although particular images might suggest different meanings to members of lower and higher castes, the very fact that many mundane particulars were indeed</page><page sequence="8">GOLD: What the Merchant-Guru Sold 29 taken as archetypes in sant poetry tended to subvert all ideas of socio-religious hierarchy. For if even the most ordinary elements of the mundane world had the poten- tial to reveal profound meanings, couldn't even the most ordinary mundane individuals have the potential to reach the divine? Moreover, if deep meanings could be seen in any object, none can easily become an ob- ject of ritual exaltation. Except for the guru and sincere devotee, no one and no thing was particularly sacred. The possibility of the divine being represented in anything regardless of traditional sanctity has led most movements of nirguna devotion to preserve an egali- tarian tone. By contrast, traditions oriented toward the particular divinity of Krishna, a conventional deity with established ties to brahminic orthodoxy, fre- quently lost any initial egalitarian impetus they may have had. Certainly, movements of both nirguna and saguna bhakti, at their beginnings, can play havoc with brahminic norms. Neither the rapturous Krishna nor the sants' formless lord need respect caste proprieties. Nevertheless, as a Hindu divinity, Krishna lends him- self to traditional ritual worship performed by brah- mins chanting Sanskrit hymns. However unorthodox Vaisnava movements may have been in their origins, many have become among the most careful of ritual purity-often measured in terms of distance from the ritually worshipped image of Krishna.13 The imagina- tive creations of the sants, by contrast, rarely lent themselves to such complex outward institutional forms.14 The sants' aniconic vision instead sometimes grew complexly in divine worlds known yogically within. Indeed, if sants gave any common object more meta- physical priority than others it was no doubt the human body itself. The human body presented as both valu- able and transient-the key to inward realms that must be used while available-is familiar in Indian reli- gions. For Kabir, certainly, it is the yogic world within the body that offers a paradise most closely approxi- mating the divine realm of Krishna depicted by SUrdas: There heavens are thundering, nectar drips down, Banana trees bloom, and the lotus shines bright: Where just His few real servants are, Kabir is bound in adoration. (Kabir 9:35) Yet while showing us the yogic riches inside the body, Kabir also stresses the body's perishability: the body it- self is mortal, available to us only on the short journey of life: An unbaked jar, this body: You took it on a trip; It broke when it was hit; Nothing remains of it. (Kabir 15:59) It may indeed be this religious priority of the human body over other imaginable objects that is the ultimate socio-religious equalizer in sant verse. Not a mythic image derived from a particular heritage and to whom access may be restricted, the individual body is the universal possession of humankind, the final reduction of all persons on earth. Everyone has a body, and with it yogic potential; but everyone also will lose it. YOGIC LANGUAGE AND THE VOICES OF THE MERCHANT-GURU By the eighteenth century, the exaltation of yogic means together with increased cosmological specula- tion led to a widespread movement of sant esotericism. As before, salvation was offered to individuals of un- distinguished caste, but it now came through complex mysteries of the sort that had hitherto been largely mo- nopolized by a brahmin elite. We hear of yogic prac- tices, closely guarded secret groups, and elaborate visions of the universe-frequently in forms that di- verge greatly from familiar brahminic norms (see Gold 1987a: 113). Leaders in the new movements-often apparently literate in the vernaculars but not steeped in Sanskrit-may not always have been well versed in the traditional versions of Hindu metaphysical lore. Never- theless, they too became engrossed in the speculation and ideas of spiritual hierarchy found throughout In- dian religions, and fashioned familiar elements into ar- cane systems marked by distinctive Hindi yogic terms. From a predominantly lower-caste movement focused around iconoclastic holy men, sant tradition had grown to accommodate the needs of respectable non-brahmin seekers looking for mysteries of their own. Sometimes elaborated in versified metaphysical trea- tises, these distinctive sant mysteries were also given a lyric presentation by middle-caste poets, in images with which they were familiar. The language of everyday life used by sants now included a broad range of socio- religious realities. If the world represented in sant verse is still not that of ritualistic brahmins, it had moved well beyond the domain of gardeners, pots, fish, and fishermen seen in Kabir. The dangers of the transient 13 This is exemplified by the development of worship in the Vallabha sampraddya. See Gold 1987a: 37-39. 14 In addition to the Sikhs, who in fact grew out of sant tra- dition (see McLeod 1976), the major exceptions here are the Kabirpanthis: see Lorenzen 1988; Kedarnath Dvivedi 1965: 203-5; and Gold 1987a: 96-97.</page><page sequence="9">30 Journal of the American Oriental Society 112.1 (1992) world described in the songs are now likely to be those met by clean cultivators and merchants. Although the yogic vocabulary of these songs is similar to that found in the early sants, it is harnessed to a different socio- religious agenda. The Songs of the Merchant-Guru Paltii Sahib-the eighteenth-century sant of mer- chant origins who is evoked in this paper's title-lived as a guru in Ayodhya, the legendary capital of Lord Ram. A small tradition that bears his name-the Paltfl panth-is still found in scattered towns and villages of the eastern Gangetic plain (Gold 1988: 62-72). Like Kabir in Banaras, Paltfl railed against brahminic au- thority in a Hindu pilgrimage center; one of the more gifted and iconoclastic of the sant poets, he is some- times known as the second Kabir (Caturved! 1972: 555). Both Paltfl and many members of his contempo- rary panth are from the caste of Kandii baniyds. Ban- iya, which I translate here as "merchant," is used throughout much of North India as generic term for members of Hindu mercantile communities; Kandli is a local variant.15 These are not the depressed castes and neo-Muslims known to Kabir and other early sants, but respectable twice-born Hindus, sometimes of consider- able means. The image of the baniya is liable to stereotype, as- pects of which are recalled in the one or two pictures of Paltui that circulate.16 Paltu is portrayed as short, a little plump, and smiling, a kindly storekeeper turned holy man: maybe he still gives sweets to children. Most other depictions of the baniyai are much less gen- erous: as merchants are often viewed throughout the world, baniyas are seen as tight-fisted and always cal- culating to their own advantage. Reference to these negative characteristics certainly has earlier precedent in sant verse, and can become particularly fierce when used to depict the hypocrisy of supposed spiritual lead- ers. Here Kabir describes a Swami of the KalI age, the present corrupt era: Kali's Swami aims to collect: Money out on interest, mind full of greed, he adds another ledger, writes another deed. (Kabir 21:19) This negative image has sometimes been comple- mented in sant bani by another, more transcendent one: that of the Lord as ultimate possessor of everything, who will settle all accounts in the end: The capital the Moneylender lent Isn't to be frivolously spent. Or you'll be in a sorry stew at the time accounts are due! (Kabir 21:22) The mercantile imagery generally found in Paltfl's verse, by contrast, tends to differ from both of these. PaltU commonly plays with the figure of the ordinary baniyi himself: poor or middle-class, the baniyii sits on a cotton mattress spread on the floor of his shop and weighs out goods on a hand-held scale, buying, selling, haggling. It was this image of the merchant as common man-with strengths as well as weaknesses, struggling like everybody else-to which Paltfu gave archetypal dimension in his verse. In Paltui's songs of the merchant, as in many of the sants' songs, the composer creates his archetype through extended metaphors. Most often, the refrain states the basic equivalence, and the higher and deeper implications of the example are developed in succes- sive verses. In separate songs, Paltfl draws out the im- age of the baniya in the bazaar in a number of different directions. Certainly, this image could be used to express what is perhaps the strongest current running through sant poetry-admonition, spiritual warning: human beings are doomed to an endless cycle of rebirths in the world unless they wake up and attempt to encounter the Lord. The round of worldly life in Indian tradition can easily be described in terms of constant exchanges among self-centered individuals. The giving and taking, mea- suring and weighing and calculation of relationships entailed by these exchanges may then suggest the metaphor of a bazaar. The psychic element that partic- ipates in the world-bazaar is often referred to by sants as their "mind" (man). This "mind" refers not so much to the intellect as to the ignorant personality, with its finite knowledge and desires. In the following song 15The Hindi term baniyd has two ranges of meaning: a nar- row one, that suggests a small shopkeeper, and a broad one, that includes anyone from a mercantile community-particu- larly those who do in fact engage in some form of trade or finance, "merchants" in a general sense. Although Paltii him- self is remembered as a shopkeeper, I have translated baniya as "merchant" for two reasons: first, the more general term is more consistent with my argument about general types; sec- ond, the activities of the merchant-buying and selling in the abstract-more readily suggest the give and take in personal relationships and the karmic storehouse that figure as motifs in the sants' songs. 16 These pictures can be found in the frontispieces to Radhadkrsna Singh (1966) and Palpt Dargan.</page><page sequence="10">GOLD: What the Merchant-Guru Sold 31 Paltli speaks of the calculations going on inside the mind, presenting the world-bazaar as a vast illusory collectivity: A merchant is someone who measures his mind [refrain] Inside the mind's a bazaar; and the mind has itself become buyer In the mind is the giving and taking-for the mind is the store; The mind lives out its life in the mind; Loading, unloading take place in the mind- where else can they go? For the mind must eat what the mind will grow; In the mind is the measure, in the mind is the weight; Palffi says it's all a circle in the mind. (3:45)17 The illusory world in which the ordinary mortal lives can also be oppressive, like the heavy load the mer- chant bears on his travels. In a song that recalls a long and powerful warning against the "peddler's" ways by Ravidas (translated by Hawley and Juergensmeyer 1988: 31-32), Paltii reminds the baniyi that he can't take this heavy load with him on his final journey. He gives him, moreover, the beginning of an alternative- if you want real goods, do business with the divine: Baniyi, what a load you're carrying! [refrain] All your friends and works won't go with you; nor other people's wealth You lay up your five senses' store, and have become so proud Sing hymns and serve sadhiis; Take payment in the name of the Lord You'd better if you want real goods; ahead there's no market or shops Palt.Udds cries out to you: Ahead the land is dry. (3:31) Illusory and oppressive as the merchant's world may be, it is nevertheless his world that is described. Every- man is presented in the likeness of the baniyi. In thus archetypalizing the merchant, Paltui appropriates con- ventional Hindu piety into his own socio-religious world, at once naturalizing traditional truths for his own community and dignifying the image of the mer- chant in the eyes of others. For in contrast to most ear- lier portrayals of the merchant, the baniyi described by Paltui may also offer spiritual treasures-which neces- sarily transforms the imagery of the bazaar: give and take remain possible in divine merchandise, but there is no mundane calculation. These new dimensions of the merchant's image can carry some distinctive socio- religious implications in the sant tradition of the eigh- teenth century: divine ways now are described in terms familiar to baniyi listeners, and the merchant sitting in his shop may have more to offer to his customers than meets the eye. The following song shows us a mer- chant hawking spiritual goods in the world, free of charge, but finding that he has no buyers. The yogic terms that come at the end of the song-nam, gabda, surat-suggest the kind of secrets the merchant is offering: Look, there's a merchant gone mad- He's running a knowledge shop. [refrain] He's selling deathless nectar, but still it seems like poison: No customers will buy it. They ask for salty snacks, he shows them sugar in the raw; He looks like he's confused. He gives loans without conditions; and asks everyone to take them. Those who do will leave him happy And won't ever be asked to pay him back. His scales forgive, his weights are full, His words are sweet for all. With gems of nam just lying in piles about He weighs them out, and asks no price. Of surat key and gabda lock He tells through yogic means. Says Paltii: Truth's a constant bargain Offered always day and night. (3:73) If the knowledge shop looks baffling from the out- side, it is even more obscure when seen from within. The next song presents an extended analogy of the paraphernalia of the shop with yogic centers in the body. PaltU tells of trikuti and the tenth door, usually identified as centers in the head; he mentions iddd, pin- gala, and susumna, the main channels of energy in the spine. The refrain suggests that now that the inner store has opened up, the merchant is not quite sure what to do with the outer one: 17 The references to Paltii's songs refer to the volume and number of the Belvedere Press editions.</page><page sequence="11">32 Journal of the American Oriental Society 112.1 (1992) Who will keep my shop now, hey, who will keep the shop? [refrain] The goods are all at trikuti, susumna's got a mattress on the floor; My main store's at the tenth door, where sits the endless Lord. I4da, pingald, my two scales, they hang from the soul's strings. I'll grasp the cross-beam of true sound, and weigh out piles of pearls. The sun and moon will keep up watch on heaps of primal stuff Climb to turiya, set up shop; that's how I'll take charge. The master satguru's interceded, I've met sweet- seller Ram; He's sounded the drum at Paltif's house, who keeps getting paid back a hundred-twenty-five percent. (3:38) Two Literary Uses of Yogic Language The yogic meanings of this song were probably as opaque to most of Paltfl's listeners as they are to most twentieth-century Westerners, but mystification of the uninitiated may well have been part of Palffi's intent. For although songs using yogic terminology are thought to communicate something specific to practic- ing yogis, most of Paltfl's listeners probably were not active practitioners. Nevertheless, the context of the song gave the yogic vocabulary some meaning for them, too. In a tradition with yogic roots that reaches out to a wider following, songs presenting metaphors of yoga can serve as a common scriptural basis for fol- lowers of diverse spiritual qualifications. For adepts, these songs could provide new perspectives on their practice, if they did not always lead them to new vi- sions. For ordinary devotees, the yogic language in mundane contexts presented a mysterious adornment to ordinary experience-a promise, perhaps, of things to come. This literary use of esoteric jargon by Paltfl differs from an important literary use of yogic terms charac- teristic of Kabir, who is famous for his ulatvarnsi, "upside-down talk"-a language of reversals found in paradoxical, riddling verses that startle listeners and may make them question everyday presuppositions. Not all of Kabir's ulatvamsi verses include yogic terms: The village's name I don't know. Without knowing, then how can I go? An age passes by and I walk all the while to get to that village, not quite a half mile! (Kabir 10:6) Nevertheless, ulatvamsis derive immediately from the rhetorical usages of tantric yogis and make frequent yogic allusions-some more, some less explicit. The two gourds of the couplet below probably refer to the highest and lowest yogic plexuses in the human body, which are hollow (Vaudeville 1974: 262 fn. 9): From worlds above to worlds below, the path's between two gourds- Where all six philosophies stumbled, all eighty-four perfect lords. (Kabir 20:5) In this couplet, the "stumbling" of both the six classi- cal Hindu philosophies and the eighty-four siddhas of Buddhist tantric tradition alludes to the true ignorance of apparently knowledgeable persons. In the next cou- plet, this common theme of sant verse appears within a more explicit yogic framework. Here, the Yamuna and Ganga refer to the yogic veins iDda and pingall, men- tioned in Paltii's song above; the unconditioned void (sahaj Sunya) is a goal found in many yogic texts; munis are traditional wise men. At the unconditioned void between the Yamund and the Ganga steps lead down to an inward bath. There Kabir built his retreat while the munis all still seek their path. (Kabir 10:7) Although poems in the style of Kabir's ulatvamsi continued to be written by later sants, with and without yogic referents, the more innovative literary use of yo- gic language by later sants was in the extended meta- phors of the sort seen in Paltfl.18 In an illuminating appendix to her translations of Kabir, Linda Hess (1983: 135-61) has suggested that perhaps listeners weren't supposed to understand the ulatvamsi poems, that their function may have been in large part to elicit the vision of a topsy-turvy world. They point listeners beyond their everyday sensibilities to an experience beyond words. In this sense, as Hess suggests, there 18Gold (1987a: 145) translates an example of yogic lan- guage in larger metaphor in a song by Bulla, who stands in the lineage of gurus from which Paltii derived. Migra's Hindi work (1969) presents a full study of ulatvrmsi among the sants.</page><page sequence="12">GOLD: What the Merchant-Guru Sold 33 may be an ultal component to much sant verse. When yogic elements enter into the ulatvamnsi, they add an- other mysterious dimension to this play, but do not radically alter it. Indeed, yogic jargon in ulatvNdsi may help belittle the yogi's mysteries, putting them in the same category as everything else: just some more elements of a topsy-turvy world. In the extended meta- phors of Paltul, by contrast, the yogic language builds out from the familiar world of the shopkeeper. The po- ems present a world that is less inverted and turned around than it is surreal, with the esoteric jargon add- ing a fantastic, supernatural dimension to the common- place image of the merchant. As in Kabjr's ulatvaimsi, these songs have their attention-getting qualities, too: the yogic treasures commanded by the baniyd at least come as a surprise. Nevertheless, the yogic vocabulary here has a greater positive value. Instead of helping to turn the merchant's world upside down, questioning its reality, it suggests valuable realities hidden within it. The use of yogic language in those songs thus seems to play on the listeners' sense of their own socio- religious type in the moral and political order that they know. For many of the ordinary people among Paltui's listeners, like most of those in his tradition today, were probably themselves from a mercantile caste. To some of Paltfl's merchant listeners, then, his description of the shop in yogic terms-even if not understood in a technical sense-might point to hidden powers within themselves. Just as they could be ignorant and calculat- ing, they could also store up spiritual goods. Thus, with Paltii, a poet from a middle caste appropriates a verse form developing in what had been predominantly a lower-class tradition. But he uses this form to imbue his caste image with the yogic mystique of a religious elite. CONCLUSION: NIRGUNA BHAKTI, LITERARY TYPE, AND THE EXPANSION OF SANT TRADITION As literature reflecting the eighteenth-century gen- trification of sant tradition, then, the merchant songs of Paltil resonate with voices from socio-religious strata low and moderately high-suggesting both the origins of the movement and the direction in which it was evolving. The merchant, a mundane image of the sort long found in nirguna bhakti, is used not simply to in- timate the Lord beyond all social hierarchies, but to reveal the divine within them, too. The image thus demonstrates the way in which sants began to find inte- gral meanings in traditional social types as they them- selves became more fully integrated into Hindu tradition. Nevertheless, Paltfu's songs, like those of other sants, continued to reflect egalitarian socio- religious attitudes characteristic of the older tradi- tion-attitudes that were now modified and given exis- tential depth through the songs' collective popular performance. For in the body of his work PaltU described not just his own caste as a potentially spiritual type: he also composed songs describing the real Rajput, a martial caste, who fought inner battles (see Gold 1987a: 66); and the true brahmin, wise without pen and ink (Paltii Dardan, 154). In Indian spiritual discourse of reformist bent-as was the sants'-the classical divisions of so- ciety are often held up as presenting ideals that all may emulate. Paltui's work gives this sentiment literary ex- pression, developing the classical social types arche- typally in inward, yogic dimensions that tend to blur any hierarchical distinctions that remain. At the same time that the widespread play of arche- types typical of the sant bMnm as a genre generates new ways of holding together diverse socio-religious strata, the textual dynamics of the bnis' popular use contin- ues to hold together different existential voices. In their performance in group devotional singing, the songs gain an evident personal religious power, keeping mundane images continually filled with fresh tensions and ambiguities. Today, throughout North India, the songs of the sants are sung and listened to widely and fervently-a practice that no doubt has considerable earlier precedent. The contexts in which they are sung differ substantially, but they have some structural ele- ments in common. The songs, for the most part, exist all at once, forming no ordered text. Different songs are chosen and juxtaposed to each other in different singing sessions, but many are familiar to most of the devotees. Recurring images provide some underlying motifs through a corpus of texts. These, when devel- oped archetypally in Wheelwright's sense, hold to- gether alternative visions of human nature-both exalted and ordinary. In this way they reveal the ambi- guity with which the sants, like proponents of many other Indian traditions, understand the condition of em- bodied human beings. Thus, as the sants' Lord without Qualities became reflected in the wider Hindu world, the traditions of nirguna bhakti became more complex. Together with brusque intimations of the Formless Lord beyond the hierarchical order now also come more intricate ex- pressions playing on social identities in positive as well as negative ways. Indeed, the merchant songs seem less intent on mocking the vanity of outward pride in caste and wealth than on fostering new percep- tions of the self within. The social leveling explicit in early aspects of the tradition continued, but in a new guise. Certainly, in presenting the ambiguities of</page><page sequence="13">34 Journal of the American Oriental Society 112.1 (1992) earthly existence, at least, all the mundane archetypes created by the sants were the same. But the import of this vision of religious equality is not that conventional social differentiation is without value but that all the social types could be spiritually complete. When devel- oped fully as archetypes, the metaphors of the sants can thus lead people to find both their commonality with others beyond hierarchical boundaries and alter- native images of themselves. Presenting the potential of all classes as well as their plight, the poets of nir- guna bhakti elaborated their literary types for a broader socio-religious world.
