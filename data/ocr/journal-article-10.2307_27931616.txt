<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphic Figurines from the Early Neolithic Site of es-Siftye (Jordan) By Hamzeh M. Mahasneh and Hans-Dieter Bienert 1. Introduction In 1992 and 1993 ploughing and bulldozing activities as well as preparations for the construc tion of a dam in the Sei el-M?gib - the second largest drainage system in Jordan - unearthed a large settlement - es-Siftye - (fig. 1) which dates to the Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic period (6500-6000 B.C.)1. The site was discovered by members of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan (Abu Dayyeh et al. 1993, 86). Architectural remains have been detected at an altitude of about 210 m above sea level on a slope some 100 m above the broad flood plain of the S?i el-M?gib and its tributary the W?d? Sal?yita, about 100 m east of the bridge where the King's Highway crosses the W?d? (fig. 2). Continuing agricultural work, terracing activities and the construction of irrigation systems further endangered the prehistoric site. Initial archaeolog ical investigations were undertaken in March 1994 upder the directorship of H. Mahasneh from the Department of Archaeology of Mu'tah University (Mahasneh 1996; 1997a; 1997b), to estimate the extent of the settlement, to document the remains, and to study the potential of additional, large scale fieldwork (Mahasneh 1997a, 227). The investigations revealed that the extent of the settlement reached up to 12 ha, matching the size of other known large Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPNB) sites in Jordan such as Gazai (rollefson 1997a; rol lefson/Bienert 1994; Rollefson et al. 1985; 1992), W?d? Su'?b (Simmons et al. 1989), Basta (Gebel/Muheisen 1997; Gebel et al. 1988; hovers 1993; nissen 1990; nissen et al. 1987), and el-Bas?t (Fino 1998a; 1998b). Due to the excellent preservation of the archi tecture and promising excavation results, further fieldwork was conducted by H. Mahasneh. To date, a total of four campaigns have been undertaken. 2. Excavation Results The excavations carried out by H. Mahasneh concentrated on three areas. The first sound ings were conducted in Area A (fig. 2), which is situated in a recent bulldozer cut that revealed remains of a building with carefully constructed walls, well-made plaster floors and under-floor channels (Mahasneh 1997a; 1997b; Bienert/Mahasneh 1998). Bedrock was reached at a depth of three metres below the present surface. The architectural remains in Area A consisted of two building units each of which had a central room flanked by a number of smaller, mostly quadrangular rooms (Mahasneh 1997a, 228-230, figs. 3-4). 1 The absolute dates for the different periods mentioned in this article refer to uncalibrated radiocarbon dates. However, it is intended that in the near future most dates will be calibrated. For calibrated radiocarbon dates see Bienert in print. zdpv 115 (1999) 2</page><page sequence="2">110 Hamzeh M.

Mahasneh and Hans-Dieter Bienert Area is located approximately 10 m to the east and uphill of Area A (fig. 2). It produced a series of closely spaced building units, quite typical for the Late PPNB at other sites in the south of Jordan, such as Basta (Gebel/Muheisen 1997; gebel et al. 1988; hovers 1993), Gamm?m (gebel 1993; Waheeb 1996; Waheeb/Fino 1998) and Ba(ga (bienert/ gebel 1997a; 1997b; 1998; Gebel/Bienert 1997a; 1997b; Gebel/Bienert et al. 1997). Similar to those from Area A, some of the buildings in Area also had plastered floors and under-floor channels, which were sometimes painted red. The blocking of passages between certain rooms or building units leads to the assumption that a change in the disposition of the rooms must have occurred from time to time. The walls of the buildings are two stones wide. The limestone is of local origin, and stones were roughly dressed into rectangular pieces. Smaller wedge stones were used between each row of stones, a building technique well known from contemporaneous sites in southern Jordan. Some of the walls uncovered in this area are preserved up to 3.5 m of high. The third sector of excavation, Area C is located ca. 25 m to the north of Area (fig. 2). It is here that the latest excavations were conducted. The architecture of that area resembles the features known from Areas A and B. However some structures in the northern part do not have the carefully constructed walls with stones slabs and wedge stones (fig. 3). Instead, stones of sometimes very different size and W?d? pebbles were used. This observation might indicate a difference in time - representing different occupation layers - and/or different uses of space. However, this has to be a goal of further investigations at the site. A total of six radiocarbon dates have been obtained from this area. The calibrated radiocarbon dates range between 7040 cal be and 6760 cal be (g?rsdorf 1999) and support the archaeological dating of the settlement to the Late PPNB, contemporary with Basta, Gamm?m and Ba(g? (g?rsdorf forthe). However, according to g. rollefson, these dates also overlap very much into the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C (PPNC) layers at Gazai (rollefson, personal communication; 1998, table 1). While no human remains could be detected in Area A apart from a few scattered bones, a number of human burials were found in Areas and C (Bienert/Mahasneh 1998, 11). Twelve of them - five from Area B, seven from Area C - were the focus of a recent study (Mahasneh in print). All burials found at es-Stftye were located in domestic areas, and were placed in shallow pits below room or courtyard floors. According to the excavator they are all related - according to the stratigraphie evidence - to a later phase of occupation of the site (Mahasneh in print). Besides primary burials, a couple of secondary burials were found. In some instances skulls had been deposited apart from the rest of the skeleton, while in others skeletons without the skull were found. This burial custom is well-known for the Late PPNB from other contemporary sites in the region (Bienert 1991; 1995; in print). Most of the burials at es-Siftye included grave goods, such as beads, pendants, rings, fossils and sea shells from the Red Sea (Mahasneh in print). However, no figurines were found in the graves or associated with them. 3. Figurines During the excavation season of summer 1997 a total number of 317 clay figurines and in addition, an unspecified number of clay lumps were found, most probably raw or rejected material originally intended for the manufacture of figurines. All figurines came from one location, Locus 9, in Square 11 of Area C (fig. 3). Locus 9 consisted of a soft and fine matrix, ZDPV 115 (1999) 2</page><page sequence="5">Anthropomorphic Figurines from the Early Neolithic Site of es-Sifiye (Jordan) 113 Fig. 3. es-Siftye, Area C, architectural remains and location of Locus 9. mixed with ashes. The figurines were found on sterile deposits, together with two basalt bolders. The surface of the locus was destroyed by bulldozer activities conducted by the owner of the site. H. Mahasneh believes that no architecture was related to the figurines. It seems that they were placed in an open area, which H. Mahasneh believes to have been part of an industrial area where a workshop for figurines was based. Clay lumps that may have been raw material for the production of figurines, as well as the high number of figurines found support that hypothesis. Some of the clay lumps could even be identified as half-fin ished figurines. No figurines were found in any other square of Area C. In total, 215 figurines (67.82%) could be indentified as zoomorphic, mostly resembling horned animals. These will be dealt with in a separate publication (Mahasneh forthc). 79 ZDPV 115 (1999) 2</page><page sequence="6">114 Hamzeh M. Mahasneh and Hans-Dieter Bienert specimens (24.92 %) are of a geometrical shape, resembling neither a zoomorphic or an an thropomorphic figure. These were the focus of a separate study (Mahasneh/Gebel 1998). Geometric figurines are quite common within the assemblage of early Neolithic figurines (Rollefson/Simmons 1986, tables 8-9; Schmandt-Besserat 1992; 1996; Banning 1998, 226-228). They are interpreted as tokens, and evidence for an early accounting system (Schmandt-Besserat 1992, 184-199; 1996, 111-125; Banning 1998, 228) and therefore - according to D. Schmandt-Besserat - were precursors of the earliest writing systems: "The abstraction of the concept of quantity (how many) from that of the quality of the item counted - concepts that were merged inextricably in the tokens - made possible the beginning of writing" (Schmandt-Besserat 1996, 121). Only 23 specimens (7.25%) have been identified - by their shape and style - as an thropomorphic figurines, all demonstrating a high degree of stylization. They have been categorized into seven classes according to their shape and state of production and are pres ented in the catalogue below. class general description registration numbers figures/Tafeln Figurines with a stylized body in conical shape. Arms are indicated as protuberances and the head/neck is indicated by a crest perpendicular to the arms. 1.3.12.17 fig. 4; Taf. 23A-B Figurines with a stylized body in conical shape (like class 1). The nose is indicated and eyes/ears are formed as protuberances on either side of the nose. 4.5.9 fig. 5; Taf. 24A- ; 27B Figurines with stylized body in conical shape (like class 1). The very schematic head has an oval shape, sometimes with a ridge on either side, which tapers and slopes from back to head. 8.11.13 fig. 6; Taf. 25A- ; 27 Body parts in conical shape; the upper part (neck/ head) is broken off. 6.7.14.19.21.22 fig. 7 (top); Taf. 26A Not clear, but probably elongated head with neck broken off a figurine. 25 fig. 7 (bottom left) Not clear, but probably a male genital. fig. 7 (bottom right); Taf. 27A Not clear, but probably unfinished figurines which most likely were damaged during the production process and therefore never completed. The damage may also have happened in the process of later accidental firing. 15.16.20.23.26 Taf. 26 Table 1. Description of figurine classes. While figurines in classes 1-3 can, in our opinion, be identified as stylised anthropo morphic shapes, figurines of classes 4-6 could conceivably also be grouped in other cate gories such as geometric figures or broken parts of zoomorphic figures. The decision to count them as anthropomorphic figurines was taken because of their stylistic relationship to the figurines of classes 1-3, and by comparison with objects from other sites, such as Gazai (G. rollefson, personal communication). The small sample size means that the classifica tion of the anthropomorphic figurines into seven classes should not be taken to be represent ative of anthropomorphic figurines produced at the site. zdpv 115 (1999) 2</page><page sequence="7">Anthropomorphic Figurines from the Early Neolithic Site of es-Sif?ye (Jordan) 115 It seems to us that the figurines were made of unbaked clay and that the baking was not intentional but caused by a fire which occurred accidentally at the site they were produced, placed or stored. It was probably the intention of the producer to harden them by sun-drying rather than baking. The figurines show different kinds of colours ranging from a rather light brown to black. The difference in colour may have been the result of the degree of contact with fire or hot ashes, rather than the result of any intentional process. The small size of the figurines, as well as their fragility, suggests that they were in use for a very short period, which would then imply that they were produced in large quantities in order to replace broken ones. All figurines show a relatively high degree of stylization. In classes 1-4 the body is of conical shape. While in class 4 (fig. 7 [top], Taf. 26A) nothing can be said about the design of the upper part, as it is frequently missing, the head/neck in classes 1-3 show different morphologies. In class 1 the head/neck is indicated only as a small crest (fig. 4; Taf. 23A-B). In this case, it is possible that a proper head was added later, made separately of the same or of a different material. In class 2, the head is more dominant, with a focus on facial features such as the eye/ear region and the nose (fig. 5; Taf. 24A-B; 27B). Class 3 shows a very schematic head, of oval shape, tapering and sloping from back to front, with the actual face orientated upwards (fig. 6; Taf. 25A-B; 27B). Class 5 is only represented by one item: the elongated, stick-like head broken off a figurine (fig. 7 [bottom left]). Class 6 is also repre sented by one object. It differs from all the others described above. It seems to be a male genital organ (fig. 7 [bottom right]; Taf. 27A), the only item in the collection showing sexual character. None of the other anthropomorphic figurines bear any sexual feature which could indicate male or female. If the absence of any such features was deliberate, then it could be argued that the anthropomorphic figurines of this collection would most likely represent males. However, the high degree of stylization demands a very cautious interpretation in this matter. Class 7 consists of probably unfinished figurines which were most likely damaged during the production process and therefore never completed (Taf. 26B). The damage, how ever, may also have happened in the process of later accidental firing. Surface treatment was very simple. There is no indication that the figurines were painted or had applications of any other kind. Items of class 1 might be an exception as was argued above. However, their exposure to fire might have diminished any paint. Some figurines (e. g. registration number 2.3.5.6.8.11.13 and 19) have a rather smoothed surface. Impressions of fingernails, a small tool, or more likely impressions of grass or other organic material can be seen on some objects, such as registration number 4.7 and 9. All figurines of classes 1-4 have a concave base, most likely part of the forming process caused by pressure of the craftsman's finger or thumb (Taf. 27B). It could also be argued that the conical shape of the body and the broad base show that the craftsman created busts not whole bodies. However, the proportions of figurines in classes 1-3 suggest that the figurines represent whole bodies. The broad base is made to provide stability and a free-standing display of the figurines. 4. Conclusions The limited information obtained during the excavation of the figurines does not provide the necessary data for a detailed interpretation of the figurines in their archaeological context. However, it seems that the place they were found was also where they were produced. This idea is supported by the presence of unfinished objects or pieces that were damaged in the ZDPV 115 (1999) 2</page><page sequence="8">116 Hamzeh M. Mahasneh and Hans-Dieter Bienert production process; they are grouped in class 7. The location could thus possibly be identified as a workshop of figurines of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and geometric pieces. The quan titive differences among the three kinds is reflected also at other sites, such as Gazai, where zoomorphic (in particular aurochs) and geometric figurines account for the vast ma jority. Anthropomorphic figurines dating to the PPNB period in Jordan are best known from Gazai (rollefson et al. 1992, 464-466, table 9; McAdam 1997). Almost all of the an thropomorphic figurines from a secure context are Middle PPNB (7250-6500 B.C.) and therefore pre-date the Late PPNB figurines from es-Sifiye. However, some of the stylized human figurines with a conical body shape from Gazai can be quoted as parallels (McAdam, 1997, fig. 10:3083 98.3067 78.3067 102b.3073 261)2. E. McADAM describes them as "stylised human figurine" (McAdam 1997, 142). At Middle PPNB Gw?r 1 two human stone figurines were found, as well as an unspecified and small number of clay figurines (Najjar 1994, 81, fig. 7). No anthropomorphic figurines have been reported from ?amm?m (gebel 1993; Waheeb 1996; WahEEB/Fino 1998), el-Bas?t (Fino 1998a; 1998b), Abu Saww?n (simmons et al. 1988), Fid?n A and C and Ba'g? (BlENERT/gebel 1998; gebel/BlENERT et al. 1997). Only a single female human figurine is reported from Beda (KlRKBRlDE 1966, 206). A small statuette, made of clay and ca. 15-20cm high, was found at W?d? Su'?b in the 1989 exca vations, but was never published (ROLLEFSON, personal communication). The Late PPNB Basta material is not yet published. However, it produced only one figurine fragment (gebel et al. 1988, fig. 14:19). Closer parallels for stylised anthropomorphic figurines are found at Tell Aswad and Tell Ram?d in Syria. H. de contenson describes from PPNB layers at Tell Aswad East and West - most probably also pre-dating es-Sif?ye - a number of stylised anthropomorphic figurines, which resemble the samples from es-Siftye (de contenson 1995, 24-25.35.39.182-185, figs. 126:9-24; 127:6-7; see also Schmandt-Besserat 1992, 36-37.93-94, figs. 24.1 24.3). In PPNB layers at Tell Ram?d, an unspecified number of stylized human figurines were found (de contenson 1971, 281; see also schmandt-besserat 1992, 88-89, figs. 38.1 38.2) which still await proper publication. The reason for the high degree of uniform stylization in the production of figurines is still much debated3. It seems to us that the figurines do not stand for individual but rather repre sent human beings in general. The similarity in the shape and appearance of the figurines leads us to conclude that they were either been used in a game, for teaching purposes or - if we follow D. Schmandt-Besserat - in accounting or the transformation of simplified information (Schmandt-Besserat 1992, 195-199). Unfortunately, the place where they were found - perhaps the workshop in which they were made - gives no information on their function or use4. 2 Further, still unpublished objects from Gazai resemble the anthropomorphic figurines from es-Sif?ye (rollefson, personal communication). 1 Concerning the interpretation of prehistoric figurines, see contributions in Cambridge Archaeological Journal 6/2. 1996. 281 -307 Here a number of authors argue about the question of "Can we Interpret Figurines?". For the interpretation of anthropomorphic figurines see also Schmandt-Besserat 1997; 1998. See also the recent discussion by McAdam 1997, 138-140 and Banning 1998, 226 228. 4 We would like to thank our friend Prof. Dr. G. Rollefson (cAin Ghazal Research Institute, Wem bach, Germany) for his valuable comments on the subject.
