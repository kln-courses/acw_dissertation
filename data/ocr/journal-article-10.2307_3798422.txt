<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Biological Survey of Katmai National Monu- ment. By Victor H. Cahalane. Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 138, No. 5. 1959. iii + 246pp. In recent years there has been increasing and unrelenting pressure by commercial interests to make available for exploitation the natural re- sources of the areas administered by the National Park Service. Such pressures by organized local groups were responsible for the initiation of the Katmai Project in 1953, a 2-year concerted effort by the government to determine the validity of the claims for and against the retention of the vast Katmai National Monument. This region, 4,214 square miles in extent, originally established in 1912 to preserve an area of striking volcanism, was later enlarged to include mountains and forests possessing a spectacular array of wildlife and great scenic beauty. The Katmai Project included studies of the fauna and flora as well as of geography, climate, shore morphology, geology, volcanism, and anthro- pology. The inventory of plants, birds, and mam- mals was the responsibility of the author, formerly Chief Biologist for the National Park Service, and this imposing task was accomplished in two sea- sons of field work. The result is a publication un- even in treatment of groups, detailed at some points and sketchy at others, falling somewhere between a popular and a scientific treatment. The book is divided into four chapters: "Intro- duction," "Vegetation," "Birds," and "Mammals." The introduction is a brief 14 pages whereas the remaining chapters contain approximately 70 pages each and consist mainly of annotated lists. These lists, the major contribution of the pub- lication, follow a similar pattern in providing scientific and vernacular names, notes on habitat occurrence, relative abundance, and localities where collections or observations were made. In some cases, particularly with regard to mammals, interesting and valuable information on behavior is given.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 311 Two hundred seventy-three species of plants were collected and identified by specialists. In general, the taxonomy of Hult6n (Hult6n, E. 1941-50. Flora of Alaska and Yukon. Lunds Universitets Arsskrift. Ny Foljd, Avd. 2, Bde. 37-46. 1902pp.) was followed, and vernacular names were taken from Anderson (Anderson, J. P. 1959. Flora of Alaska and Adjacent Parts of Canada. The Iowa State University Press, Ames. 543pp.). However, the breakdown of species by groups (algae, 2; fungi, 3; lichens, 7; ferns, 10; flowering plants, 232) is preceded by the interest- ing statement that "Some species, especially among the lower plants, probably were overlooked." The list of flowering plants seems nearly complete and includes one species, a grass, new to Alaska. The confusing vernacular names, however, are insuf- ficiently standardized to have any value. Cer- tainly a great many, such as mooseberry for high- bush cranberry (Viburnum edule), are not those in popular usage in Alaska. The inclusion of re- marks on "Utilization" taken from Heller (Heller, Christine A. 1953. Edible and Poisonous Plants of Alaska. Univ. of Alaska and U. S. Dept. Agr., College. 167pp.) seems strangely out of place. First, it is illegal to utilize plants within a park or monument, and, second, it is presupposed that the average person can identify plants at the species level. We are told, for example, that one member of the Umbelliferae (Cicuta) is quite toxic, while another, very similar plant (Angelica) is edible. One of the few photographs of plants portrays Angelica, making it possible for anyone carrying this book to find at least one of these two species for his evening meal. After reading that certain plants are rich in vitamin C, pro- vitamin A, useful as salves, poultices, cathartics, intoxicants, or are inflammatory to intestines, whereas others are cooked for greens or pot herbs, are usually boiled, and are either sweet and edible, flavorsome when cooked, or best when raw, I was not sure whether I had hit upon a pharmacopoeia or a cookbook. The deletion of this material, to- gether with rows of catalog numbers, would have provided space to relate this interesting flora to that of the Aleutian Islands and to that of the Alaska mainland. Further, the detailed intro- ductory list of collecting stations includes informa- tion repeatedly given in the annotated lists; a more effective treatment could have been devised. Thirty-seven species of birds were added to the Katmai list, bringing the total recorded in the monument to 117. Most are included in the analysis of ecological distribution preceding the annotated list; since no attempt is made to rate the birds according to limiting factors in the en- vironment, these listings simply duplicate informa- tion given later and therefore have little value. The vernacular names used are inconsistent and confusing. We are confronted at one point with Pacific loon or double-crested cormorant, and at others with Pacific Arctic loon and Northwestern double-crested cormorant. The use of such names for subspecies is ill-advised at best, and combina- tions such as Northwestern great shrike, common mallard, and others, may confound many users of this book. One name, Aleutian red sandpiper, will confound anyone. A much more serious problem is encountered in the taxonomic treatment of subspecies. Trino- mials are used nearly throughout, some following Gabrielson and Lincoln (Gabrielson, Ira N., and Frederick C. Lincoln. 1959. The birds of Alaska. The Stackpole Company, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and the Wildlife Management Institute, Washing- ton, D. C. 922pp.), some the 1957 A. O. U. Check-list of North American Birds (American Ornithologists' Union. 1957. 5th ed. Lord Balti- more Press, Inc., Baltimore. 691pp.), and others not traceable to either source. The use of tri- nomials implies that critical taxonomic compari- sons of specimens were undertaken, but such was not the case. No collections were made, and only the scant specimens of a few species collected by Hine (Hine, James S. 1919. Ohio J. Sci. 19(8): 475-486) in 1917 are mentioned. The area at the base of the Alaska Peninsula has been shown (Williamson, Francis S. L., and Leonard J. Pey- ton. 1962. Faunal Relationships of Birds in the Iliamna Lake Area, Alaska. Biol. Papers Univ. of Alaska 5. 73 pp.) to be one where populations of several species of birds show characteristics intermediate between those of races inhabiting the interior and coastal regions. Nonetheless, Cahalane has no trouble in handily disposing of the fox sparrow, "unalaschcensis," the yellow warbler, "rubiginosa," the downy woodpecker, "nelsoni," and others. At the same time he is reluctant to use trinomials for Bubo virginianus, Loxia leucoptera, Passerculus sandwichensis, and others because the evidence does not warrant such usage! Pinicola enucleator flammula, how- ever, is identified on the basis of one sight record when the type locality for P. e. alascensis is on the Nushagak River only a short distance away. Some names (Regulus calendula cineraceous and Perisoreus canadensis arcus) relate to races which do not occur in Alaska, and another, Riparia riparia maximiliani, though not recognized by the A. O. U. Check-list, is included without comment. It is regrettable that specimens were not collected and thoroughly studied. This, admittedly, is time- consuming and tedious, but hardly more so than for plants. The annotations relating to the birds are de- tailed and in many instances quite informative. They are occasionally verbose and sometimes show a lack of familiarity with a species or its habitat. Two rare stragglers to Alaska, Clark's nutcracker and the ruddy duck, are listed. Another straggler, included in the hypothetical list on the basis of a single sight record outside the monument by</page><page sequence="3">312 Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 27, No. 2, April 1963 another participant, is the marbled godwit, a bird of the prairie regions far to the south. It is said, however, that the place of sighting is so similar ecologically to areas in the monument that this species will undoubtedly be recorded there even- tually. Similar criticisms can be made concerning the taxonomic work on mammals. No specimens were collected, no comparisons made, and yet trinomials are used. The source for the names (Hall, E. Raymond, and Keith R. Kelson. 1959. The Mam- mals of North America. Vols. 1 and 2. The Ron- ald Press Company, New York. 1083pp.) was, however, used consistently and much of the con- fusion present in the section on birds largely avoided. The annotations, excepting the occasional anthropomorphic lapses, are generally excellent and indicate the keenness of the author as a field observer. The account dealing with the brown bear is especially noteworthy and its considerable length appropriate to the importance and interest of this impressive mammal. Preservation of this bear is alone ample justification for the retention of the Katmai National Monument. 'PIenty-eight species of mammals are listed, and an additional eight placed on a hypothetical list. A variety of topics is covered in the introductory chapter, including a history of the region and a discussion of the National Geographic Society expeditions following the volcanic activity of 1912. The few brief comments on the original Aleut- Eskimo inhabitants might better have been ex- panded and treated separately. A good description of the country, especially the geology, is presented, and we learn that there are 15 active or recently active volcanoes within the boundaries. There is a good account of the climate. Cahalane divides the monument into the Arctic and Hudsonian Life Zones. Species of plants and animals characteristic of each zone are listed, and the zones are briefly discussed. I feel that this presentation is particularly weak and com- pletely overlooks the fact that no less than three and, especially with regard to the flora, likely four major faunal and floral regions intermingle at the base of the Alaska Peninsula. These are the Moist Coniferous Forest, Coniferous Forest, and Tundra Biomes (Shelford, V. E. 1945. "The Relative Merits of the Life Zone and Biome Con- cepts." In V. E. Shelford, [director], Wilson Bull. 57(4):248-252), and the Aleutian Faunal District of Nelson (Nelson, Edward W. 1887. Report upon the Natural History Collections Made in Alaska between the Years 1877 and 1881. Arctic Ser. 3. U. S. Army, Signal Service, Washington, D. C. 337pp.). Basic ecological considerations, in- cluding a discussion of the major vegetation types and how these interdigitate in the area, should have been presented. For this it would have been extremely helpful to have included a vegeta- tion map of Alaska and one of the monument. Ultimately, then, the fauna and flora of this fascinating area could be related to the coniferous forest and tundra biomes of the north. Preceding the annotated list of plants there is an interesting discussion of revegetation following volcanism. A valuable comparison is made of the findings of Griggs (Griggs, Robert F. 1915. Am. Geog. Soc. Bull. 47:193-203; 1919. Ohio J. Sci. 19(3):173-209; 1919. Ohio J. Sci. 19(6):318- 342; and 1933. Am. J. Botan. 20(2.):92,-113) in the early 1900's with those of the author in 1953- 54, especially in The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes (Griggs, Robert F. 1922. Natl. Geog. Soc., Washington, D. C. 341pp.). Six plots for future studies of this kind were established; these were surveyed to permit future relocations and were carefully described and photographed by the author. Later study should be most rewarding. The book is illustrated with 17 plates (two photos each), three figures (outlines of the plots), and a large foldout map of the monument labeled to show localities mentioned in the text. There is much in this publication to be com- mended, especially the sections on natural history, although it must be used with caution by the serious student of avian and mammalian taxonomy and distribution. The need for this book was great because it fills an important gap in our knowledge of the biota of our parks and monu- ments. These areas, of which Katmai is the largest, are a most precious national heritage. We need to learn all we can about them.-FRANCIS S. L. WILLIAMSON, Arctic Health Research Center, P. O.
