<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAGIC WEAPONS IN CELTIC LEGENDS1 DETAILED descriptions of weapons are not forthcoming from legends. Generally the compilers restrict themselves to mentioning shortly the most striking feature. Our investigation of magic weapons in Celtic legends illuminates one of the reasons, perhaps the main reason, for the omission of detailed descriptions, namely, the prevalent conception that the magic qualities of the weapons were of far greater importance than their efficiency or costly appearance. A good example therefore can be found in the " Taiin ", where the sickle of a battle-chariot is compared with the sharpness of a charmed sword.2 All legends reflect the fact that it was the hero's trust in the magic virtue of his armour which increased his skill and enhanced his power of endurance-thereby assuring him of ultimate success in warfare. Our view that the external nature of a weapon is not decisive for the issue of the fight is strengthened by the well-known story of Lugh's casting a sling-stone at Balor: " Lugh and Balor of the Piercing Eye met (in the second Battle of Moytura). An evil eye had Balor. That eye was never opened save only on a battlefield. Four men used to lift up the lid of the eye with a polished (?) handle (which passed) through its lid. If any army looked at 1 I am greatly indebted to the late Dr. E. M. Guest who very kindly read my manuscript and made many useful suggestions. 2 The Ancient Irish Epic Tale Tdin Bd Cualnge, tr. Jos.

', says Balor.... The lid is raised from Balor's eye. Then Lugh cast a sling-stone at him, which carried the eye through his head.... " 1 While most sling-balls were naturally shaped stones, some of them were artificially made and even composed of weird material. Cuchulain overcomes Foill by hurling an iron ball in Foill's " foreheads midst ".' The blood of toads, bears, and vipers was mixed with sea-sand and hard- ened.5 A ball formed of lime and the brain of the dead champion Mes Gegra, was kept among the trophies in Emain Macha. One day Cet carries this ball off; later he adjusts it in the sling and throws it so that it hit the crown of Conchobar's head, causing after long illness the death of the king.6 The intention was obviously to invest the artificial sling-balls with supernatural power. A passage describing the making of Finn's sword supplies another example for the same notion : Finn's mother " warned him to be careful not to enter the smithy where her father was to be at work upon the sword. The mraterial he was to use would be iron and coals from a place that was no good, and the sword was to be tempered in the blood of the first living creature that entered the smithy." T'he cruel custom of tempering the sword in blood may be similar to that which has been exposed by the discovery of the Heathery Burn Cave. Near this cave, in which a group of smiths lived and worked in the Bronze Age, broken human skulls were found, reminding us " that in barbarous societies metallurgical science is still bound up with mystic rites for which human blood may well have been required." 8 Magic virtue was, however, also attributed to natural materials. The wood of the yew-tree, e.g. highly esteemed for the making of spear-shafts, was used for the celebrated spear of Celtchair.9 The yew-tree of Ross provided not only the wood for the shaft of Duach's spear but also for the shield of Hugh, king of Oriel. " The name of the shield was Duv-Gilla (the Black Attendant), and one of its properties was this, that-whosoever was opposed to it in the field of battle became as enfeebled as a lying-in woman, and all fled before 3 " The Second Battle of Moytura ", tr.

A poisonous milk drips down out of that tree of strong hardness: through the drip of the bane of no slight stress, the tree splits right in two. For the space of fifty full years the hazel remained unfelled, but ever bore a cause of tears, being an abode of vultures and ravens. Manannan of the round eye went to the wilderness of the White-hazel Mountain, where he saw a leafless tree among the trees that vied in beauty. Manan- n~n sets workmen at woQrk on this tree without slackness: to dig it out of the firm earth: this were a mighty deed. A poisonous vapour rises up incessantly from the root of that tree until it killed-perilous consequence-nine men of the working folk. It killed nine others of them of the people of smooth Manannan-the story of the tree well I wot-and blinded a third nine. . . ..Lucra was the wright that wrought the plaited blossom-light shield-lord of the Marannmhils of the plain-for Manannan the warrior. Two virtues of the virtues of the shield, to be untouched in battle or in fray-few were the shields its equal-before it 'twas a rush of utter rout." 1 The survival of tree-worship is presumably the origin of the belief that supernatural power resided in the yew and hazel-trees and consequently in the weapons made from them. We now turn from wood to iron. It is noteworthy that unlike classical literature which refers to frequent " injunctions against its use in ritual, in favour of the more lucky bronze ",12 Celtic legend has preserved no relic from the transitional stage between the Bronze and the Iron Age.- From that early stage onward, when iron was an innovation, it was probably regarded with an anxious reverence which created the belief in its supernormal virtue. A general allusion to the magic potency inherent in iron can be found in the poem Cad Goddeu, referring to Taliesin's own sword.13 The following two instances divulge the more definite notion that iron is able to dissolve a charm: Fiacha told Finn: " Whenever thou shalt hear the fairy melody,... from the javelin's head strip its casing and apply the weapon whether to 10 The Proceedings of the Great Bardic Institution, ed.

Finn obeyed and thus pre- vented the fire which would have consumed Tara and by his counter- action he was able to kill Aillen mac Midhna." 14 Jain cuts off two heads of the giant, one each day. " The third head jumped on again as fast as it was cut off ; but at last, by the advice of a hoodie, the cold steel of the sword was held on the neck till the marrow froze, and then the giant was killed." 15 The Mabinogion contains a rather puzzling passage: Arawn, king of Annwvyn warned Pwyll that Havgan might be killed only by the first stroke. " And if he ask thee to give him another, give it not, how much soever he may entreat thee, for when I did so, he fought with me next day as well as ever before." 16 It seems not unlikely that Arawn's warning is based on his belief in Havgan's charmed life, magically protected by the virtue of iron, which, however, only comes into force with the second touch. It is difficult to resist the impression that weapons which are depicted as of " extraordinary brightness of shining " might have some relation to our subject. Their recurrence in Celtic legend as well as their survival in Gaelic folklore show a peculiar fondness of this motif, either conveyed in the descriptions of spears and swords bursting into flames (the spear of Celtchair and the sword of Rhydderch Hael) 17 or in those of shining arms (Conaire's sword, Cuchulain's sword, a spear mentioned in the " Tain ").18 It is no improbable surmise that the flaming and shining swords and spears can be traced back to the same phenomenon. A significant clue may be afforded by the omission of any reference to the material which reflected the light, in marked contrast to other legends where we are told of spears and shields embellished with many coloured stones which shine even in the night like the beams of the sun.19 Shining weapons have been claimed as the lightning attributes of particular divine beings, but it seems to me that Douglas Hyde comes nearer the truth when he speaks of the astonishment caused by a bright steel sword in an age of bronze.20 I venture to take a step further by suggesting that this seemingly exaggerated description might have originated in the amazement aroused by the sight of arms, by no means numerous, that were brighter than any others.

In prehistoric times meteoric iron must have been considerably more abundant in the British Isles too, than now, since " there were all the accumulations of previous ages for primitive man to draw upon." 21 Unless we admit that the use of meteoric iron in the form of weapons (or tools) is the only explanation for its disappearance-our supposition that the shining weapon in Celtic legend represents the memory of a weapon made out of meteoric iron must remain hypothetical. The observation of iron falling from the sky certainly contributed to the world-wide belief in the supernatural virtue of iron. It appears, moreover, reasonable to conjecture that arms made of celestial iron22 helped to stimulate the desire for more weapons of mystic provenance. I am therefore inclined to see in the very early interchange of weapons over great distances the satisfaction of a longing for supernatural weapons. If this theory is correct we could establish a psychological background to the social and economic aspects of the interchange of weapons, so well expounded by Hawkes.23 Mysterious origin is common to many prominent weapons in Celtic heroic story (Nuada's sword, Lugh's spear, the .sword of Fergus, and Cuchulain's gae bulga).24 The different statements referring to King Arthur's sword, Caliburn, and his spear attribute not merely mysterious provenance to them, but direct at the same time attention to the magic cunning of their artificer. In Layamon's Brut we read that King Arthur's byrnie was made by Wygar, " the elvish smith ".25 It is not difficult to imagine that the marvelling at the sight of a smith at his forge, as it has been handed down by Herodotus (I, 68), led to the belief in the magic cunning of the smith. That this universal belief prevailed also in Celtic Britain is clearly expressed in St. Patrick's hymn: " I summon to-day all .. . virtues (of God) between me (and these evils) against spells of women and smiths and wizards." 26 From the indispensability of the smith for the community there grew the personality of a smith-god. It was Goibniu, the Celtic smith-god himself, who forged the lances with which the Tuatha De Danann later on conquered the Fomors, promising : " No spearpoint which my hand shall forge shall make a missing cast. No skin which it pierces shall taste life afterwards." The lucky number three applies to him and his two divine assistants, and also to the making of the weapons : " Goibniu the Smith was in the forge making swords and spears and 21 J.

Then Luchtaine the Wright would make the spearshafts by three chippings, and the third chipping was a finish and would set them in the ring of the spear. When the spearheads were (stuck) in the side of the forge he would throw the rings with the shafts, and it was needless to set them again. Then Credne the Brazier would make the rivets by three turns, and would cast the rings of the spears to them, and it was needless to... before them; and thus they used to cleave together." 27 Another time, while Goibniu was at casting from the thongs the spear- heads an accusation is brought against his wife and he grew jealous thereat. There was a spear-shaft in his hand, when he heard the story, and he sang incantations over that spear-shaft, and at every one that came to him he struck a blow with the end of that shaft. Then if the man escaped, a swelling full of matter and pus arose, and burnt the man like fire.28 Both stories, like that of Finn's sword, quoted above, lead us to that series of weapons which were intentionally invested with supernatural power by duly performed magic observances during the forging. Magic rites may be suspected in the stories of the intractable lance, the Carr of Belach Duirgen, of the spears which were used by the Fianna in the Battle of Ventry and of the shield of Hugh, king of Oriel.29 Regulations in regard to lucky days and hours were observed for the forging of the spear with which Llew Llaw Gyffes was struck, as well as for the three spears which were to kill Cuchulain, his charioteer and his horse. The former had to be a year in the forming and nothing was done towards it except during the sacrifice on Sundays.30 The latter were forged by the three sons of Calatin who had studied magic ; for seven years they worked only one day of each year.31 Moreover, the day on which the hero received the weapons was also of great significance: One of Cathba's pupils asked him " what fortune and presage might there be for the day they were in, whether it was good or whether it was ill. Then spake Cathba: 'The little boy that takes arms this day shall be splendid and renowned for deeds of arms above the youths of Erin and the tales of his high deeds shall be told forever, but he shall be short-lived and fleeting.' Cuchulain overheard what he said, though far off at his play-feats south-west of Emain; and he threw away all his playthings and hastened to Conchobar's sleep-room to ask for arms ...." 32 The ideas hitherto dealt with are chiefly concerned with the technical side of the equipment; there remain for examination the personification 27 " The Second Battle of Moytura ", op. cit., pp. 89, 93-5. 2s Cormac's Glossary, tr.

The problem of the personification of weapons cannot be analysed without considering two phases of Celtic belief, animism and anthropomorphism, which have been called primitive and inevitable phases of religion.-If we venture to interpret the beginnings of art, we may recognize an animistic tendency in some Magdalenian paintings in Pindal (Asturias) and Pechialet (Dordogne), which depict weapons of the chase wounding or killing the prey without any appearance of the hunter, as if they were acting by their own force and reason. Of course, we find Celtic animism risen to higher notions: " the spirit becoming more and more individualized, acquiring a name, usually at first an adjectival name, expressing his function and then approaching more and more nearly to a definite personality." 33. In the legends the weapons are spoken of as sharing the excitement and impatience of their owner before the battle or as taking direct part in the struggle. The descriptions of the spears of Celtchair and Lugh, and those of the swords of Nuada, Manannin mac Lir, Fergus, Ferdiad, Cuchulain and Finn 34 reflect, though embellishing, the actions and reactions of the heroes. Notwithstanding the fact that offensive and defensiveweapons alike act as though they were alive, their deviating attitude should later on be borne in mind. The impatient yearning for the attack evinced by Lugh's spear and by the spear of Celtchair is betrayed by their inherent heat. The former has " its blade always in a pot of water, in order that it should not (by its fiery heat) melt down the city in which it is kept." 35 For the latter " a caldron full of poison is needed to quench it when a deed of man-slaying is expected." 36 Both accounts are evidently derived from'the method of heating water by means of hot lumps of iron.37 This series of " sensitive weapons "38 includes also the prophesying spear of Cuscrad. " Neither before nor after do the silver windings run round (the spear) by the side of the bands of gold but on the eve of a triumph." 39 It was taken to forebode evil when spears and shields cried otit and fell from their racks.40 Did the scribes who recorded these incidents, in heroic legend remember Cicero's passage (De Divinatione, I, XXXIV) about the warning which was given to the Spartans just before 3` Cyril Bailey, Phases in the Religion of Ancient Rome (Oxford, 1932), p. 36. 34 " The Destruction ", op. cit., p. 301; " The Second Battle of Moytura " op. cit., p. 57 ; El.

The noticeably different function attributed to the shield, the pro- totype of defensive equipment, is known as the shield-moan, that is, the shield's calling together all available help for its hero in dire need.41 In "The Tragical Death of the Sons of Usnach " the king Conchobar arms his son Fiacha with his own arms for the fight against Illann. " Illann got the better of Fiacha, and made him crouch beneath the shadow of his shield, and the shield roared at the greatness of the need wherein he lay." 42 An allusion to the shield-moan can be found in the lamentation of the lady Crede over her dead husband Cael. Praising him for his valour, she said as a certain proof of his strength and bravery, that " in the battle his shield ne'er uttered outcry." 43 One more instance of a weapon expressing itself is that of Orna, the sword that " spoke" : In the second Battle of Moytura " Ogma the champion found Orna, the sword of Tethra. Ogma unsheathed the sword andl cleansed it. Then the sword related whatsoever had been done by it." O'Curry has suggested as a possible explanation for this unique legend that the names of the battles or deeds in which the sword had been employed were inscribed on it.44 There are two manifestations of the belief in the inner life of weapons the custom of putting a taboo on a weapon and that of directing its action by reciting an incantation. Four records of the first mentioned usage have been preserved; two of them, however, remain obscure.45 The third is intelligible, although the story does not clearly distinguish between the object and the subject, a characteristic of very primitive reasoning : Three taboos were on the spear of Ailill Dock-Ear; all these were broken by Ailill and he had three disgraces as long as he was alive.46 The fourth taboo, " it was geis for Caier to part from his knife ",,4 may allude to a mystic danger which threatens those heroes who part from their weapons. Among them are the Giant Gwrnach and Daire Donn.48 All these instances owe perhaps their very vague nature to the great antiquity of the ideas underlying the taboo itself. 41 " TAin ", op. cit., p. 354. 42 El.

Thereupon the spear moved from the hand of Ferchess and went through Mac Con in his chariot... .. 50 " Forthwith goes Find on Cuirrech's track, ... till he saw before him Cuirrech's shadow, and throughout the shadow he hurled a spear, chanting a spell over its head, and strikes it into Cuirrech, who fell there- by." 51 The following episode is of special interest on account of its reference to the yew-tree : He on whom Assal's spear of red embossed gold inflicts a gory wound, lives no more; he who wields it, never misses his mark, if he only says " ibar " to it; if he then says " arth-ibar ", it comes back to him.52 Since the personification of weapons is indissolubly linked with their former sacred character, it must be our endeavour to trace the survival of the cult of weapons or their use in ritual in these islands. The custom of addressing swords as if they were real persons 53 recalls Irish warriors' prayers or incantations before a sword stuck in the earth, as has been recorded by Spenser."5 The Scottish sword-dance has been traced back to a war-dance which sought to bring good-luck to the dancer's clan.55 The same purpose underlies the following legendary episode: When Cailte was asked why the pillar-stone was named Cloch-nan-arm, " the stone of the weapons ", he replied that the Fianna used to come to it every Samain-tide to sharpen their weapons.56 The grinding of the weapons on the stone, annually repeated on the Celtic New Year's festival, was obviously meant to ensure victory in warfare during the coming year. Probably the pillar-stone was a grave-monument erected for a great hero who continued to protect his country by blessing the weapons. I feel that we are entitled to this inference, because Samain commemorates the dead and is the festival par excellence on which the dead are accessible to their clans-men. The symbolic use of the sword is without doubt connected with its ritual use. Solinus (cap. XXXIV) has handed down to us the fact that in Ireland, " if a woman be delivered of a manchilde, shee layes his firste "9 Irische Texte, op. cit., II Serie, i. Heft (Leipzig, 1884), pp. 192-3. 50 K.

From now onward the testimony of non-Celtic historians and archaeological research instead of the legendary texts will furnish the proof that weapons were invested with magic potency by means of their decoration.-At first sight the comparison between classical writers and actual Celtic weapons, both centring round the beginning of our era and the earlier manuscripts of the legends, which are almost ten centuries later, appears rather as too bold a stroke. But two considera- tions speak in favour of such an attempt. The first follows Prof. Thurneysen who set forth that even the earliest manuscripts indicate merely an " Endpunkt ", a latest date and that various characteristics point to much earlier sources." The second consideration is based on classical analogy, namely on Homer's description of Cretan weapons which were at least 300 years older. Even with the help of archaeology and classical texts the amuletic nature can only be established for a few ornaments and representations, while others will keep the secret of their inner meaning because the link of association has been lost. It is, however, incontestable that every pattern was chosen on account of its intrinsic meaning and not solely for adornment. When we reconstruct some magic symbols which rendered the weapons infallible, a double intention may be perceived behind their choice. Firstly the protection of the wearer by sustaining his spirits; secondly, the terrifying effect upon his enemy evoked by the mere sight of the models. Amongst the various kinds of armour the most conspicuous part is played by the shield, for the palpable reason that its surface invites more decoration than any other weapon. A law made by the Ulster Knights expresses that " the carved device of each shield made for them should be different from those of all the others. When Cuchulain repaired to the manufac- turer of shields, whose name was Mac Eng6, he said: 'Make a shield for 57 Julius Solinus, tr. A. Golding (London, I59o). 58 Wh.

" 61 The design may have consisted either of animal representation or of some formal ornament. Shields decorated with figures of beasts, but without any reference to the particular species, are frequently mentioned in the " Thiin ".6 Diodorus of Sicily (V, 30) exposes the underlying idea: the figures of animals on Gaulish shields are skilfully worked with an eye not only to beauty but also to protection. Tacitus (Germania, XLV) amplifies Diodorus' statement in his record about the IEstians : " He who has the figure of a wild boar about him thinks himself secure even in the thickest ranks of the enemy without any need of arms or any other mode of defence." The boar-design on the Witham Shield (British Museum) and the bronze figures of boars (British Museum) should be recalled in this con- nexion.63 Another amuletic ornament referred to in the legends is the wheel. Since the days of sun-worship, the wheel represented the sun as well as its beneficent properties. Therefore its representation developed gradually from a sacred symbol into an amulet. Wheel-amulets have been found at Colchester, Hounslow, Stanwick, at the Fort of Newstead and at Llandovery.64 The benevolent sunlike qualities ascribed by the Celts to the wheel are clearly shown in the story of Cuchulain's crossing the Plain of Ill-luck.65 Conaire wore, so we are told, in front of his mantle, possibly as a kind of breast-protection, a wheel of gold which reached from his chin to his navel.66 One troop came from the north, from the northern part of Connaught .. ..Every single man wore a golden wheel on his breast.67 Shields decorated with five-fold golden wheels, or with circles of gold are described in Celtic legend.68 Like the wheel the circle has been derived from the solar disc and has similarly become charged with magic potency. Archaeology has hitherto failed to provide evidence for wheel-decorated armour in these islands, but shields with circular ornaments have been brought to light at Witham and Battersea.69 The Witham shield bears in addition to the boar and the circle a third magic safeguard, the coral. The importance of the coral as an amulet in warfare has been recorded by Pliny (H. N. XXXII, 21). We may infer from his statement : " It was the reddest colour which is held in the 61 MS.

A similar magical potency may therefore have been also ascribed to the red enamel with which the Celts decorated their weapons. Why was protective power assigned to the red colour? Red, found in the warming fire as well as in the life-blood, became universally associ- ated with life-giving properties. The red ochre with which in the Upper Palaeolithic the bones of the famous " Red Lady " of the Paviland Cave in South Wales had been covered, causing Hawkes to speak of the " magical replacement of the departed life-force ", is probably one of the oldest documentary proofs of belief in magic in these islands.70 Nowhere could the life-giving red colour be better applied as an amulet in deadly struggle than on the weapons themselves. Pliny's report (H. N. XXXII, 21) that the Gauls adorned their swords, shields, and helmets with coral, holds good also for the Celts in the British Isles. Among the actual weapons decorated with coral or red enamel, are a sheath of bronze from an interment at Grimthorpe, two iron daggers from the Thames of La Thne date, the Witham-shield (British Museum), the Battersea-shield (British Museum) and a bronze helmet (British Museum), found in the river Thames at Waterloo Bridge.71 In the " Tain " we read that Ferdiad's crested war-cap is studded with red enamel.72 In the " C6ir Anmann " (Fitness of Names) a helmet is mentioned with two horns of silver, and a horn of gold.73 The following coincidence is of great interest: we are told that at Cenn Abrat Cairpre's soldiers wear helmets with a horn of gold or silver or bronze, which horns they detach and lay in the ford before the battle. At Cork, below the old bottom of the river Lee, three bronze horns of a helmet were found. Marg. E. Dobbs remarks on this find that the horns have " holes by which they could have been laced on to metal or leather and easily detached ". They were presumably offerings " to bring luck ,,.74 What may have been the reason for this decoration? MacCulloch derives the horned helmet from the wearing of a head-gear made of the skin or head of clan-totem-animals.75 If we follow him, totemistic thought is the source for the conviction that the horned helmets would protect their wearers in face of danger. Diodorus (V, 30) alludes to the great size of the warriors wearing horned helmets; and, indeed, it is suggestive that their gigantic appearance evoked panic among the oppos- ing host. This is not the place to discuss the considerable part played by cunning 70 op. cit., p. 38. 71 J. Thurnam, On Ancient British Barrows ... ; Archaeologia XLIII (London, 1871), p. 475; C. E.
