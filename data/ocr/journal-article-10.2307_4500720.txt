Dictionaries of quotations spared their users the toil and tedium of doing their own reading and excerpting from the works of the wise and learned. Indeed, such dictionaries positively undermined habits of reading from cover to cover or quoting in context - the whole point was to dip in and out at whim, grabbing this or that shiny sentence, magpie-like. The book under review is admirably designed for such purposes. The entries are alphabetically arranged by author, with full names (and I do mean full: Charles John Huffam Dickens, Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck), dates and brief identification ('British novelist', 'German physicist'). The quotations are numbered for ready reference and full references are given wherever possible. Occasionally, when the quotation is pithy and well known, it is given in the original language, e.g. Goethe's Zweck sein selbst ist jegliches Tier ('Each animal is an end in itself', p. 248). At the end of the entry, highlighted, are placed quotations about the author, e.g. 'ON DALTON: Atoms are round balls of wood invented by Dr. Dalton' (p. 149). The index - the essential tool for magpie readers - is excellently laid out: keywords ('analogy', 'protons', 'chemists', 'stupidity') are in bold, under which the phrases in which they are found are listed with abbreviated references to authors' names ('DARW', 'EINS') as well as page and quotation numbers. There is a certain weighting towards the beginnings of quotations in the indexing. If all one can recall is a snippet like 'great tragedy of science', the index will reliably turn up Thomas Henry Huxley's 'The great tragedy of Science - the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact' (p. 313), but not if all that is stuck in memory is 'ugly fact'. On the whole, however, the book is visually pleasant to use and a delight for Jack Horner readers; almost wherever one sticks in a thumb, one pulls out a plum (at least if one's thumbs are not occupied holding places in the index - one of those ribbon markers would have been handy). But it is a tribute to the dictionary's editors and their many consultants that the book can also be read like a regular book, continuously. I will not pretend that I actually did read from A to Z, cover to cover, but once sucked in by an entry chosen by chance or design, the temptation to keep reading, page after page, was irresistible. There are the names one expects to encounter (Claude Bernard, Hermann von Helmholtz, Isaac Newton, le tout DSB), plus the familiar chorus of commentators on science and scientists (William Blake, Gustave Flaubert and much deliciously bad verse). There are also many surprises, thanks to the editors' ecumenical tastes and serene indifference to the demarcation criterion. Their ample understanding of science embraces the visionaries Roger and Francis Bacon and the cultural anthropologist Franz Boas, Leon Foucault of the pendulum and Michel Foucault of the archaeology of knowledge, Sigmund Freud pro psychoanalysis and Karl Popper contra, Wernher von Braun and Tom Lehrer (but not, alas, Lehrer on von Braun). Shakespeare and the Bible each command a fair number of pages. His- torians of science are also well represented, especially those of more recent vintage (Alexandre Koyri~, yes; Johann Poggendorff, no). The editors embrace the quick as well as the dead, and a</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 277 good thing too, otherwise readers would have been deprived of novelist Philip Pullman's exquisite description of the aletheometer (which, as the editors helpfully point out, is a parody - or rather, an apotheosis - of Crookes's radiometer) and chemist Frank Westheimer's gratifying admission that 'surprisingly, history is much more difficult than chemistry' (p. 615). An effort has been made to balance entries by ancient and modern authors, women and men, although the latter greatly predominate in both cases. There are a very few entries devoted to non- Western figures (if the likes of Avicenna can really be counted as non-Western). Everyone will register a few omissions (I for one regretted the absence of John Evelyn and Samuel Pepys), but these are peccadilloes in light of the generous scope of what has been included. Only the stern admonitions of the editors of this journal to reviewers not to quote at length from the book under review prevent me from going on to do just that. What one learns from reading straight through a few hundred pages of the Oxford Dictionary of Scientific Quotations and an equivalent swathe of the plain old Oxford Dictionary of Quo- tations is that scientists are on the whole more long-winded than other intellectuals. By my very rough count, the average entry in the ODSQ is two to three times as long as that in the ODQ. This will probably not come as news to historians of science. Nor will they be surprised to learn that the bon mot density in the ODSQ is rather lower than in the ODQ, and that the real knee- slappers come from men and women of letters (George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde) intent on pricking the balloon of science's prestige. It is a pity that neither Groucho Marx nor Mae West took much interest in science. But there is a great deal of fine writing on display here, some of it playful, some rapturous and some wondrous strange. Perhaps more surprising is the number of quotations, even for nineteenth- and twentieth-century figures, which are listed as 'attributed'. Since the editors have been assiduous in providing citations when citations are to be had, one can only assume that these were not to be had by even the most beaverish research assistant. Lore and anecdote still circulate in science, entangling lives and works more tightly than the official ac- counts of either scientists or historians might admit.
