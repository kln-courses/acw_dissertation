<plain_text><page sequence="1">Travelling in Circles: Postcolonial Algiers in Zineb Sedira's Saphir Joseph McGonagle SPACE IN POLITICAL, SOCIAL and geographic terms, as well as in terms of its importance within the exhibition venue, has remained a key concern throughout the work of the British-based Franco-Algerian artist Zineb Sedira.1 Born in Paris in 1963 to Algerian parents, Sedira moved to London in 1986 where she studied fine art practice and lives to this day, working in a wide variety of visual media. Her works have been exhibited worldwide and now form part of several public collections, including the Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration in Paris, where her works Mother Tongue (2002) and Mother, Father and I (2003) are featured on per manent display. Given the titles of these latter works, it is perhaps unsurprising that much of Sedira's art was previously viewed as either directly or indirectly autobio graphical. Migration, identity, and diaspora were already key themes in her work, and several pieces, such as those shown in her first major UK solo exhi bition, Telling Stories with Differences at Cornerhouse in Manchester in 2004, depicted her alone or with family members. Viewed in hindsight, this exhibi tion marked an important juncture in Sedira's practice. Although her previous creations never in fact centered exclusively on the autobiographical, her sub sequent work signaled a change in emphasis, bringing a recurrent focus on narrative spaces other than those provided by self and family, spaces empha sizing architecture, transport, and the nautical in particular.2 The current article considers a key work from this latest phase of Sedira's practice that both uses and represents space in compelling ways: the 19 minute dual-screen HD video projection Saphir (2006).3 As will become clear, even if the sense of mystery, the explicit focus on composition and aes thetics, and the emphasis upon sound rather than dialogue make of Saphir an intriguing world that encourages universal resonances beyond its setting, it can also be read productively in terms of Franco-Algerian relations and the local geographical, architectural, and socio-cultural specificities of postcolo nial Algiers. Algiers in visual culture Whether known as Alger la blanche, Marseille's Maghrebi twin, or as the site of an infamous battle during the war of independence, the city of Algiers &gt; L'Esprit Créateur, Vol. 51, No. 1 (2011), pp. 26-37</page><page sequence="2">Joseph McGonagle has long fascinated artists working across a range of visual media. As Zeynep Çelik has argued, colonial Algeria was "the most important, the most cher ished, the most invested in, and the most problematic of all French territories outre-mer." Algiers became "the colonial city par excellence, the terrain of many battles—cultural, political, military, urban, architectural."4 Many French and other European Orientalist painters migrated to the city in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to depict on canvas its trademark palette of blue and white, dazzling sunlight, and brilliant blue sea.5 Land scapes were, of course, not the only draw, and the perceived otherness of the local colonial subjects also served as captivating subject matter, which is no doubt one reason why Delacroix's Femmes d'Alger dans leur appartement (1834) remains one of the most famous paintings associated with the city. Fol lowing Algerian independence from France in 1962, the allure of Algiers as a powerful signifying space has certainly remained strong within contemporary visual culture, and the city has featured prominently in several recent films, such as those of Merzak Allouache and Nadir Moknèche, as well as served memorably as the setting for the dénouement of Tony Gatlif's Cannes award winning Exils (2004).6 Shot completely in the Algerian capital, Zineb Sedira's Saphir therefore forms part of this wider corpus of images that take Algiers as their setting. Sedira's novel use of space and screens to probe questions of postcoloniality in present-day Algiers provides a fresh interpretation of the city, a renewal that is operative both for those looking in from the outside and also for local audi ences who, as the Algiers-based critic, curator, and art historian Nadira Lag goune-Aklouche has argued, were surprised by Sedira's interpretation: Décidément, comme d'autres artistes d'origine algérienne vivant en Europe, Zineb Sedira apporte un regard nouveau et inédit qui laisse médusé le public algérien, sur des parties de son propre pat rimoine, de ses pratiques culturelles et de ses préoccupations mettant en valeur des morceaux d'un réel dont nous ne soupçonnions pas toujours la richesse parce que, le vivant de très (trop) près, nous le voyons sans le regarder.7 Premiered at The Photographers' Gallery in London in 2006, Sedira's dual screen video projection was shown within a separate room. The installation formed part of a wider exhibition (also entitled Saphir) that included, else where in the gallery space, a series of photographs in medium and panoramic format featuring other sites along the coastline of Algiers.8 Enigmatic in their depiction of unidentified individuals, these photographs showed several people framed in a manner that suggested isolation and solitude. Such a suggestion chimed well with Saphir's moving images, which engaged with the city's colo Vol. 51, No. 1 27</page><page sequence="3">L'Esprit Créateur mmm -1 Figure 1. © Zineb Sedira, Saphir (2006). niai heritage and postcolonial present by focusing on two silent and curious figures: a woman described in accompanying paratexts as being French and of pied-noir (colonial European settler) origin, and a local Algerian man. The woman (played by Caroline Lena Olssen) is shown to be staying at a colonial era seafront hotel; the man (played by Samir El Hakim) is often shown walk ing around outside the hotel and staring out to sea (Figure 1). As these two figures are almost the only people shown on screen, and as they remain nameless with no details of their greater lives evoked, the conse quent mystery that surrounds them may mean they could be read as anybody and the setting they inhabit construed as akin to that of many other port cities. At the same time, given the actors' and characters' different ethnic origins and Saphir's clear emphasis upon the urban and maritime spaces of Algiers, this man and woman can also be read as emblematic figures, each symbolically representing a much wider constituency: on the one hand France and its colo nial past, and on the other, postcolonial Algeria. I will therefore argue that Saphir accordingly encourages viewers to reflect upon historical and contem porary patterns of migration and the different diasporas that circulate between these two countries. Saphir: aesthetics and politics In his essay contained within the book published to accompany its London exhibition, however, Richard Dyer argues that Saphir "is not political, in doc umentary terms [and that] it does not emphasise the usual postcolonial debates and concerns of identity, race, capitalism, migration, colonialism and the 'other.'"9 What Dyer consequently chooses to emphasise instead are the work's aesthetic and poetic qualities, of which there are many. First, by play ing upon the colours blue and white, the dual-screen projection embraces the traditional palette with which the city has been depicted. At one moment, for example, while the left screen shows a blue sky, the right shows the white net 28 Spring 2011</page><page sequence="4">Joseph McGonagle curtains of a hotel window. This binary is extended in the following sequence, where the left screen focuses on white crockery and napery inside the hotel, while the right again features the brilliant cloudless blue sky outside the hotel, where the man stands. The use of visual imagery provides another example of how the aesthetic is privileged. The juxtaposition of shots of balconies and eyes, for instance, renders the hotel's façade anthropomorphic, an effect also detected in some of the accompanying photographs, where the empty window frames within the dilapidated shell of a derelict coastal building also evoke the orbits of a skull. Seeing and the framing of vision also recur in other still images made along the shore, which show several people looking seaward and apertures via window spaces, exposed cavities that allow the Mediter ranean and surroundins landscaoe to be sliniDsed. In the installation itself, the lyrical qualities of the moving images are also accentuated by repeated shots of balustrades, staircases, and banisters both inside and outside, which emphasise their mutual linearity. A notable play of movement and stasis also occurs within and across the two screens. For exam ple, at times both actors are shown sitting and standing still, almost motion less, but the camera circles around them. Elsewhere, whereas one screen shows a pan from left to right, the other displays a static shot or, alternatively, both cameras remain static only for the stillness on one screen to be contrasted by movement on the other, such as an ascending lift or the man walking upstairs outside as the woman stands on a balcony above. These patterns of sequencing lend the projection a distinct rhythm, and the recurrence of such imagery and motifs suggests circularity, with the sight of similar actions and images shown at different times on both screens instilling a strange sense of repetition. The absence of dialogue or obvious overarching narrative only serves to heighten the mystery such images evoke. I will return to dwell upon the intriguing atmosphere this combination of techniques creates. However, from the very start of Saphir, this representation of space in postcolonial Algiers presents a world where these metaphorical figures seem locked together on screen, compelled unwittingly to circle one another. Although my reading of Saphir emphasises its visual qualities, sound also plays a crucial role. Both capturing the bustling nature of the Algerian capital and suturing the two screens sonically, the evocative soundtrack emphasises the acoustics of the installation space and adds an important aural quality to the images projected. The prominent noise of road, rail, and maritime traffic contrasts sharply with the characters' apparent stasis and the relative stillness of the images shown on screen. Furthermore, the increasing of the sound track's volume at the start and end of the projection—and the inclusion of Vol. 51, No. 1 29</page><page sequence="5">L'Esprit Créateur similar sounds in both segments—also heightens the sense of repetition and circularity the images evoke. Indeed, the fact that there is often a disjuncture between what is seen and heard within the installation suggests that these two figures—not unlike the hotel itself—belong to another time. The sonic space created thus helps imply that the world they inhabit lies strangely out-of-joint with the wider port city—en décalage—just as the installation's concentrated focus on the space of the hotel and its immediate environs in many ways iso lates it from the rest of postcolonial Algiers. One should not underplay the purely aesthetic significance of Saphir's rhythms, echoes, and textures. Viewers may nevertheless choose to trace a polit ical subtext within the images, or imagine one that underpins them. For, despite Saphir's abstract appeal, the water we see on screen is after all not merely any stretch of sea but the Mediterranean, a particularly charged geopolitical space and a defining feature of historical and contemporary Franco-Algerian rela tions.10 Moreover, despite Sedira's spuming of many of the most well known sites and landmarks of the Algerian capital in Saphir, the city shown is recog nisably Algiers, and several of its spatial specificities are showcased, as are some of the features of history and migration between Algeria and France.11 These features are most clearly evoked via the two unnamed characters on screen. Consider first the local man, seemingly so entranced by the bay before him. His reasons for looking out to sea, never elucidated, could be myriad, and while many residents certainly can often been seen gazing at the Mediter ranean from the city's shores, given current events it is tempting to read him as a harrag, a term used to define those mostly young men who risk a treach erous voyage across the sea to Spain or Italy in order to gain clandestine entry to Europe.12 The difficulty experienced by many Algerians in obtaining visas for EU countries partially explains why some of the most desperate should risk such a venture. As reports tragically continue to confirm, they risk death in their endeavours and currently prison, if apprehended by the Algerian authorities. It may come as little surprise, therefore, to learn that when Saphir was shown in Algiers, the role of harrag was the one that many local viewers assumed the man incarnated. Since this role is never affirmed during the pro ieetion however it remains but one of several nossible readines.13 If the woman in the film is similarly viewed in terms of wider phenomena, she provides a rather stark contrast: a French tourist of pied-noir origin, she is visiting Algeria for the first time and retracing the steps of her father.14 Her presence could therefore be seen as an acknowledgement of those pieds-noirs and their families who have travelled to postcolonial Algeria to (re-)engage with the past, and whose numbers have apparently increased since the end of 30 Spring 2011</page><page sequence="6">Joseph McGonagle the Algerian civil war. Furthermore, it is arguably her very presence as a woman of pied-noir origin within this particular art-deco hotel that allows the colonial past to play such a pivotal role in Saphir and thereby to disturb the postcolonial present. This disturbance is compounded by the intriguing use of a brief special effect. In one scene inside the hotel, the woman's sudden dis appearance into thin air as she walks down a corridor immediately gives her presence a spectral quality suggesting that her stay is, in fact, more permanent than temporary and that she is haunting the building. Many of the enigmatic uses of sound and space in Saphir can therefore subsequently be reinterpreted in the light of her spectrality. The frequent separation of each actor on adja cent screens, the apparent obliviousness of the man to the woman's presence, and the fact that they seldom appear within the same frame, might suggest that this revenante—"returning" to a city she knows only through her father—in fact resides in a parallel netherworld, stalking the corridors of a building she can never leave. Ghosts and haunting in postcolonial Algiers Appropriately enough, the metaphor of ghosts and haunting has been com monly used to describe the traces of pied-noir presence in postcolonial Algeria today. Given that one of the accompanying photographs in the original London exhibition was entitled Haunted House (2006), such summoning of spectres seems far from coincidental15 (Figure 2). Moreover, this vision of spectrality in Saphir lends itself productively to a reading of the video projection in terms of the "hauntology" outlined by Jacques Derrida in his Spectres de Marx (1993).16 Since Derrida's arguments pertain primarily to textual analysis, applying them to Saphir is not necessarily straightforward, but aspects of his thought can nonetheless illuminate some of the events depicted on screen. In Derrida's reading, acknowledgement of the spectre and its characteristic oscillation between absence and presence, death and life, can initiate a deconstructive turn within a given object of scrutiny, consequently throwing into question any neat ontologies and previous certainties. Furthermore, for Derrida, as Colin Davies explains, "Attending to the ghost is an ethical injunction insofar as it occupies the place of the Levinasian Other: a wholly irrécupérable intrusion in our world, which is not comprehensible within our available intellectual frame works, but whose otherness we are responsible for preserving."17 It is only through embracing an encounter with its alterity, by communicating with and listening to the spectre, that "the structural openness or address directed towards the living by the voices of the past or the not yet formulated possibil ities of the future" can be grasped (Davies 379). Vol. 51, No. 1 31</page><page sequence="7">L'Esprit Créateur Figure 2. © Zineb Sedira, Haunted House (2006). If the woman's appearance on both screens during Saphir were viewed more as a spectral apparition, her presence could be interpreted as an invita tion to attend to her otherness and to attempt to understand what her presence may mean in present-day Algiers. The fact that the woman never speaks in Saphir, however, might lead viewers to conclude that hers is a voice that cannot yet be heard, perhaps also leading them to wonder who would listen were she to speak.18 The ethical injunction here, then, could be for viewers on both sides of the Mediterranean to listen to such ghosts and, given the hotel setting, to learn to accommodate them. Here Sedira's imbrication of colonial pasts and postcolonial presents, of French and Algerian citizens, and of the physical and the spectral seems to epitomize well what Steven Nelson has termed—the generality of the label aside—"diasporic art": a form that "chal lenge[s] homogeneous fictions of nation, nationality and citizenship," a chal lenge that many would do well to meet in both France and Algeria today.19 Setting and space This conjuring up of Algeria's French colonial past within Saphir also depends significantly upon the precise choice of setting and on how space is shown there. As mentioned above, the action in this piece, despite its being 32 Spring 2011</page><page sequence="8">Joseph McGonagle set in a capital city, takes place within a very small perimeter in and around a hotel whose name conveniently provides a homonym for Saphir, the Es-Safir. Situated by the sea and next to the Assemblée populaire nationale, this edifice occupies a prominent position and enjoys commanding views of the bay beneath. It has a noteworthy history. Designed by the architects Auguste Bluyssen and Joachim Richard and built as part of the centenary celebrations of French occupation, it was originally named—after its family of owners— the Hôtel Aletti and housed a municipal casino when it first opened in 1931.20 It later briefly served as setting towards the end of Julien Duvivier's film Pépé le Moko (1937), was requisitioned by the State post-1962, and was eventually renamed the Es-Safir.21 Given its renown within the city, this building can be considered as an important lieu de mémoire of both French and Algerian his tory, alongside those other urban spaces of Algiers identified as such by Çelik.22 The building's art-deco décor, fixtures, and fittings inside still con note the 1930s, affording contemporary visitors a vivid impression of step ping back in time. Sedira's images, however, are set resolutely in the present-day, and here the location of the Es-Safir becomes important. As the noises of different vehicles heard on the soundtrack suggest, it lies at the hub of a transport net work. It is opposite not only the ferry terminal for France and Spain, but also the depot of interwilaya taxis, the bus connection to the international airport, and a main train station. Given the significance of its name, the Es-Safir's location is even more apposite: meaning "ambassador"' in Arabic, grammat ically "safir" shares the same root letters (s-f-r) as the verb "to travel" and thus further underlines Saphir's themes of motion and migration.23 Such emphasis upon travel is, however, ultimately ironic given the ways both of the installation's characters appear to go round in circles on screen. Although often shown gazing outwards, they are frequently framed within shots that constrain them; even if they are perennially on the move, they never seem to arrive at their destination or to leave the vicinity or even, in the woman's case, the hotel building. A clear tension thus is created between movement and iner tia across both screens, with the only travel appearing to be through time to the bygone era of French colonialism that the Es-Safir evokes—known locally as le temps de la France—without ever leaving the present. It is a French homonym of the hotel's name, of course, that serves as the work's title, but this spelling change also opens up one further semantic field. The reference to the French for 'sapphire' not only alludes to the blueness of the surrounding sea and of the city's famous shutters and wrought-iron bal conies but also to the jewel itself which, given Saphir's evocation of the colo Vol. 51, No. 1 33</page><page sequence="9">L'Esprit Créateur niai era, might lead Anglophones to recall the expression "the jewel in the crown" and thereby potentially evoke latent parallels between French and British (post)colonial history.24 Considered thus, Sedira's choice of title and location, even if potentially generic, seems far from incidental and instead signifies a very conscious play on words, with the hotel, sea, and transport hub around it combining to evoke a palimpsest of journeys and displacements. Indeed, Tom Trevor has described port cities as "symbolic sites of cultural exchange. They are the points of entry and departure, the mouth of an imagined body of the nation-state, where the foreign gets muddled up with the familiar and land-locked certainty is blurred by maritime exchange."25 It seems all the more appropriate, then, that the sea, this strange duo border, is the Mediterranean, whose "poly-linguistic and poly cultural composition [...] encourages a reshuffling of the usual cards of national belonging and unilateral framing."26 As has been mentioned, since it is positioned opposite the ferry terminal the Es-Safir is a sight that has greeted millions of maritime travellers since its opening. It therefore seems fitting that Saphir's last shot pays tribute to this. Starting outside the Es-Safir, a slow and steady 360-degree pan shows the neighbouring seafront buildings before piv oting around to focus on the immense bay that stretches out beyond the city before finally returning to land and to its starting point at the Es-Safir, upon which the pan briefly continues before fading out. For Sedira herself, this final shot is of crucial importance because "il nous ramène vers la réalité à un moment où l'on ne s'y attend plus" (Van Assche 61). If the grace of the 360-degree pan seems far from a dizzying whirl trans porting viewers back to the present-day, the fact that its trajectory begins at the Es-Safir and continues beyond it as Saphir ends suggests that all journeys are circular, an impression reinforced by the return of the sound of swallows and maritime traffic that marked Saphir's beginning. This final shot may imply that the man and woman have merely been going round in circles and, since the pan does not stop, that their journeys will be never-ending, but the sudden sight of the bay of Algiers and the Mediterranean's large expanse beyond it also tantalisingly suggests new, wider horizons beyond the Es-Safir. These will indeed be explored later when the actor El Hakim returns in Saphir's sequel, MiddleSea (2008). Concluding remarks Despite the potentially universal resonances of Saphir's aesthetics, Sedira's representation of space within postcolonial Algiers also permits a reading of the work in more specific terms as a compelling commentary on 34 Spring 2011</page><page sequence="10">Joseph McGonagle Franco-Algerian relations, indelibly marked by wider contemporary geopoli tics. Even if, within the time and space of Saphir's projection, France and Algeria ultimately appear forever strangely conjoined via the couple on screen, this final shot of the Mediterranean—a sea that both joins and divides the two countries—potentially transcends the limbo in which they seemed condemned to rest. As the images fade on such an enigmatic representation of space in postcolonial Algiers, perhaps only one question remains: when the 360-degree pan's revolution ends, like a croupier's spin of the roulette wheel that the Es-Safir once housed, on whom will fortune smile? University of Manchester Notes Elements of this research were first presented at the Association for the Study of Modern and Contemporary France conference in Manchester, UK (2008) and were briefly summa rized in my review of Sedira's 2009 New Art Exchange exhibition in Nottingham, UK: Joseph McGonagle, "Zineb Sedira: Floating Coffins, Saphir &amp; MiddleSea," Nafas (April 2009): http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2009/zineb_sedira (accessed on 21 December 2010). I would like to express my gratitude to the British Academy for their award in 2008 of a Small Research Grant that enabled me to conduct research in Algiers for this article. Examples include the photography Maritime Nonsense and Other Aquatic Tales (2009) and TrainStation: The Death of a Journey (2010), and the installations Floating Coffins (2009) and Shattered Carcasses and Architecture of the Forsaken (2009), which build upon the interest in travel and landscapes demonstrated in earlier works such as On a Winter's Night, A Traveller (2003). See http://zinebsedira.com/ (accessed 21 December 2010). Saphir was premiered at The Photographers' Gallery, London, UK, during 29 September 26 November 2006 and has subsequently been shown in a variety of venues internationally. Comments in this article regarding the installation's physical display will relate to its orig inal exhibition in the London venue, where a variety of accompanying related photographs were also displayed. A subsequent companion piece, MiddleSea (2008), a 16-minute single screen projection shot on super 16mm film, was premiered at The Wapping Project in London, UK, during 11 September-19 October 2008. Sedira originally envisioned these works as part of a trilogy and, at the time of writing, talks were continuing regarding the commissioning of a third and final work for 2013.

The qualities of light in Algiers fascinated many painters upon their arrival in the city. See Nadira Laggoune, Alger dans la peinture (Algiers: Régie Sud Méditerranée, 2000), 20. After his debut film Omar Gatlato (1976), Allouache's Bab el-Oued City (1994) and Bab el Web (2006) were also set in the capital, as were Moknèche's Viva Laldjérie (2003) and Délice Paloma (2006).

Moreover, as Majumdar points out, once Algeria became part of metropolitan French terri tory in 1881, this stretch of sea became reduced to "nothing more than an internal waterway in the ideological discourse of supporters of Algérie française, who claimed that 'the Mediterranean flowed through France, just like the Seine flowed through Paris.' " Margaret A. Majumdar, Postcoloniality: The French Dimension (New York: Berghahn, 2007), xxv. 11. Those familiar with the city should instantly recognise the Es-Safir hotel and seafront. The accompanying book and exhibition texts displayed outside the London installation took care to reveal Saphir's setting and also the ethnic origins of the man and woman shown on screen. 12. The term harrag (plural harraga) comes from the Arabic verb for "to burn." Originating from the French use of brûler as "to ignore," it is meant here in the sense of brûler les fron tières. Other meanings, such as the burning of identity documents by clandestine migrants, have also been attributed to it.

Whilst his staring out to sea remains enigmatic throughout Saphir, the actor El Hakim sub sequently did play the role of a harrag in Merzak Allouache's film Harragas (2010). 14. Sedira's casting of these actors deliberately blurs fact and fiction: El Hakim had previously worked in France, but lived in Algiers and had no desire to return; Olssen's father was a pied-noir and discovered the country her father had left behind during filming. As Sedira explained, "Saphir se situe entre fiction et réalité [...]. J'ai [...) désiré que mon installation vidéo bascule entre des faits réels et un espace romancé," quoted in Christine Van Assche, "Zineb Sedira in Conversation with Christine Van Assche," in Saphir, Zineb Sedira (London: The Photographers' Gallery, 2006), 61. 15. Nicknamed locally la maison hantée, this striking building that sits on the coastal road between Bologhine and Raïs Hamidou in the capital's outlying suburbs is the subject of many stories. It previously housed the École des deux moulins and was apparently bombed by the OAS (Organisation armée secrète) in 1962. Its state of utter disrepair contrasts sharply with the Es-Safir but also complements it as an additional monument to French colonialism.

The male character's voice is never heard either and thus, perhaps more contentiously, the metaphor of the living dead could also be extended to him if we choose to read him as rep resentative of many of the hittiste (young male urban unemployed) generation in Algeria, some of whose bleak outlook on life under the current political regime was summed up by the title of Farid Alilat and Shéhérazade Hadid's book, Vous ne pouvez pas nous tuer, nous sommes déjà morts: l'Algérie embrasée (Paris: Éditions 1, 2002). 19.

Coincidentally, a subsequent project by Bluyssen was the Rex cinema in Paris, which opened in 1932 and—for very different reasons—became another key lieu de mémoire in Franco-Algerian history. As Georges Azenstarck's secretly-taken photograph shows, this was one of the places outside which Paris police penned in wounded Algerian demonstra tors during the massacre of 17 October 1961.
