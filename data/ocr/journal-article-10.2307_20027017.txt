<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTICIPATIONS ERWIN N. HIEBERT The Uses and Abuses of Thermodynamics in Religion The great bulk of literature on the interaction of science and re Ugion in the Western world over the past century revolved largely about matters related to their warfare and reconciliation. In the majority of works written on this topic since 1850, the biases of the authors were transparent and strong in the defense of either science or religion. Thus, the losses to religion were chalked up on the credit side of science and vice versa. This attitude has prevailed even though many of the most intensely controversial issues seemed to disappear into obUvion without any concessions of permanent damage in either camp. In earlier times, by contrast, it was commonly beUeved that an intimate knowledge of natural philosophy could only show the way to a greater reverence for the Deity who had called the cosmos into existence and had sustained it. With such a concept of the presence and action of God in nature, neither warfare nor reconcfliation was a matter of vital concern for natural philosophers or theologians. Within the mechanistic tradition of early modern science, it was considered quite unacceptable to demand that God operate through fitful interventions from a supernatural sphere above and beyond the natural world. The alternative was to emphasize, as the deists did, that the study of nature revealed the wisdom of God in his original design. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, nature was regarded as the most positive foundation for belief in the Deity. It was, in fact, considered a more acceptable foundation than theology, which had caused persecution, war, and hostiUty since the Reformation. In more recent times a favorite approach to the problem, viewed 1046</page><page sequence="2">Thermodynamics and Religion from the side of science, was to concentrate on those historical ad vances in the natural sciences that contributed most to the erosion of traditional religious institutions, practices, concepts, and beliefs. Frequently the intent was to demonstrate the practical absurdity and logical meaninglessness of specific elements of religious faith. This approach was founded on the assumption that the conflicts between science and religion were largely resolved by the advance of science and the retreat of reUgion. A familiar argument proceeded somewhat as foUows: Various aspects of nature, including vast domains of animate and inanimate matter, were once thought to belong exclusively to the mysterious and sacred realm of truth which science would never invade. With the maturation of science, modern man acquired factual information and scientific theories by means of which those "mysterious realms of truth" came to be annexed to science in various concrete develop ments within astronomy, evolution, genetics, meteorology, biochem istry, medicine, pharmacology, and the study of animal behavior. It was claimed that as long as man's custom to worship God in a prescientific way prevailed, it was unlikely that man would ex amine the logic and meaning of his worship. As John Morley, the English statesman and man of letters, expressed it: 'Where it is a duty to worship the sun it is pretty sure to be a crime to examine the laws of heat." The advancement of science changed these cus toms. With its unreasonably effective and precise mathematical language, and its concepts about atoms, energy, genes, and cells, science appropriated to itself those realms of truth that had once been taken to be the sole prerogative of religion. No wonder men were left hugging obsolete and empty religious concepts. No won der the institutionalized rituals appeared sterile. According to this view, only a dim future could be augured for religion except for those who were too witless to recognize the evidence against it, and for those who were so persistent and ingenious in their mental gymnastics as to succeed in barricading themselves against scientific criticism. Religious systems based on na?ve, stopgap excuses for God in nature, the scientists argued, had provided their own built-in doom as science was seen to "take over." Arguments of this type naturaUy led to the serious questioning of the values of the traditional religious beliefs and institutions. More detrimental to religion, in the long run, was the attitude of viewing traditional religion not as something to be combated or maligned, but as something irrelevant to man's life in society?some 1047</page><page sequence="3">ERWIN N. HIEBERT thing to be by-passed or quietly laid to rest while moving on to other non-supernatural, less other-worldly, more secular tasks and objectives tied to more positive phenomenological evidence of what is and what might be. Science itseU was taken at times to represent a new high mode of religious activity?something akin to Spinoza's intellectual percep tion of God carried over into the life of the experimental and theoretical scientist. That is, science was seen to represent the search for God's truth?irrespective of the "beliefs" of truth's spokes men. At this level of discussion, science and reUgion were no longer in competition with one another as a world view. "Winning out" and "conflict" had lost their meaning in the complete overlap of unitary objectives. The alternative posture was to accommodate one's thought; to accept the mutually exclusive compartmentalization of science and religion by holding to two "complementary pictures" of man's view of the world: the scientific or material picture, and the religious or spiritual picture. Unfortunately the pictures were blurred, and their boundaries fll defined. Thus, no one could predict when and where scientists would raise and answer questions that had been nurtured within the traditional precincts of theology and philosophy. Al ways a possibility, to be sure, was the substitution of ultimate sys tems of thought other than those of history and tradition?other religions, that is. At the opposite end of the problem, from the side of religion, were efforts to reappraise and defend religion, theology, revelation, the church, and the "spiritual" needs of man in society by rejecting, denigrating, devaluating, or reinterpreting and adjusting scientific theories and explanations in ways designed to remove the existing conflicts. The extensive Uterature devoted to this subject covered the fuH range of arguments?from shallow discourse, ignorance, intolerance, equivocation, and clever semantics, to analyses and thoughtful encounter characterized by acuity, rationality, finesse, and charm. The focus invariably fell on the removal, somehow, of irrecon cflable dissim?arities and contradictions. The scientific claims of mechanistic cosmology, for example, were taken to be exaggerated; Uteral Biblical interpretations were seen to be too inflexible. Darwinian evolution was criticized for its endeavor to provide excuses for missing links. The Biblical account of man's genesis was demythologized. The religious significance of BibUcal records, his 1048</page><page sequence="4">Thermodynamics and Religion torical accounts, miracles, and textual contradictions was salvaged by reinterpretations that placed the emphasis upon non-literal mean ings of the text. By adopting a language that was not literal but symbolic and analogical, theology could secure itseff against all the strictures of science. So, too, could it defend itseff against the criticisms of logic by claiming that its language was not logical but paradoxical. On the other hand, a knowledge of God that was merely symbolic, analogical, or paradoxical was considered by sci entists to be no real knowledge at aU. II While there are a great many general works that employ a broad historical approach to the interaction of science and religion, there are few that discuss the use to which science has been put in answering questions of a fundamentally religious cast. Yet the in fluence that thermodynamics, for example, has exerted upon re ligious thought over the past century testifies to such use. The first and second laws of thermodynamics have been used, affirmed, re jected, manipulated, exploited, and criticized in order both to further and to censure religion. If the history of science is to be more than an internal analysis of the manner in which science came to be what it is today, or at any other time, the historian of science may have to venture into new territory. This new territory stretches beyond the confines of the traditional study of the major documents that have contributed to the experimental and theoretical progress of science. Indeed, if history is a record of man s ideas and behavior in place and time, then it may be quite as legitimate to study the interaction between thermodynamic thought and religion as it is to study the internal history of thermodynamics per se?although the documents for the two kinds of historical study are quite different. In examining the use of thermodynamic principles in religious (and perhaps pseudo-religious) thought, the Uterature that is en countered may not always be what, with propriety, may be called first-class. The criterion for considering a given author's treatment of a subject must necessarily be its relevance to history, and not its intrinsic merit as a work of enduring scientific or religious im port. This is not to defend the study of any crack-pot thermody namicians, phflosophers, or theologians; but, rather, to suggest the pertinence to this historical study of literary works, crack-pot or 1049</page><page sequence="5">ERWIN N. HIEBERT not, provided they exerted some noteworthy effect upon society. The works, in other words, must mirror something of the feelings and the attitudes of the age, irrespective of whether they would have stood the test of excellence in the eyes of the elite in science or religion. The essential substance of this phase of the history of thermodynamics or religion is, therefore, not what happened but what was thought or said about what happened. Ill The first law of thermodynamics, the principle of conservation of energy, was enunciated in the 1840's by Mayer and Helmholtz in Germany, Joule in England, and Colding in Denmark. There were a number of other persons who entertained energy-conserva tion ideas before and after the 1840's, but in one way or another they provided less satisfactory formulations of the principle than the persons mentioned. Suffice it to say that conservation of energy was an independent, multiple discovery that burst forth among various European scientific investigators who were more closely tied to civil and military engineering, medicine, physiology, and brew ing than to anything going on at the academic centers in the physical sciences. In Julius Robert Mayer, the law takes the form of an assertion that various forms of energy are qualitatively transformable, quan titatively indestructable, imponderable objects.1 In the work of Mayer, Joule, and Colding, there are also theoretical calculations and experimental investigations expressly designed to give the numerical equivalence of various forms of energy. Except for a rider to the first law, which Einstein attached in 1905 for mass energy conversions, there are no clear-cut natural processes known to violate the principle of conservation of energy. In other words, it is impossible, by mechanical, chemical, thermal, or any other devices, to construct any kind of perpetual-motion machine that creates energy from nothing. The second law of thermodynamics (an extension of Sadi Carnot's principle of 1824, and Clapeyron's algebraic and graphical repre sentation of the same in 1834) was formulated in various ways by Clausius, Kelvin, Boltzmann, and others after 1850. This law ex tends beyond the principle of energy conservation by dealing with the direction in which a process can take place in nature; that is, energy conservation does not suffice for a unique determination of 1050</page><page sequence="6">Thermodynamics and Religion natural processes. For example, the second law stipulates how an exchange of heat by conduction can take place between two bodies of different temperature. The principle, therefore, tells something about the quantity of heat that can be converted into mechanical energy in an ideal heat engine operating at a given temperature dif ferential between the combustion chamber and the exhaust. This means that available and unavailable energy can be dis tinguished and meaningfully discussed. In fact, the capacity factor for unavailable energy is an extremely versatile thermodynamic func tion called entropy. In all systems in which boundary conditions are defined in such a way that no energy transfers can take place across the boundaries, the entropy increases for all spontaneous processes within the system. Entropy increase corresponds to a decrease in the available energy. The net result is that in all natural processes some energy ends up being unavailable. An equivalent statement would be to say that systems in nature move spontane ously from order to disorder, from lesser to greater randomness, or toward a state of maximum probability. In 1865 Clausius put the first and second laws of thermodynamics into the following simple verbal form: "The energy of the universe is constant. The entropy of the universe tends towards a maximum."2 These two statements, along with various logical and Ulogical ex tensions of the energy and entropy principle, constitute the back ground to the following discussion of the interaction of science and religion. IV The acceptance of the laws of thermodynamics, slow at first, especially among physicists and chemists, was followed by a period of rapid exploitation that revolutionized and unified the study of chemistry, heat theory, heat engines, radiation, electricity, and magnetism. Less respectable, but nevertheless real, were the far reaching deductions, discussions, and speculations regarding the significance of thermodynamic concepts in cosmological works deal ing with the source of the sun's energy, the origin of the solar sys tem, and views on the expanding and contracting universe. On the strength of the many far-reaching inferences that had been derived from a small number of axioms, thermodynamics, by the end of the nineteenth century, had taken its place alongside mechanics and electromagnetics as one of the main theoretical p?lars of classi cal physics. 1051</page><page sequence="7">ERWIN N. HIEBERT It was virtually inevitable that some of the thermodynamic ex citement of the nineteenth century should carry over into specula tions concerning the problems of physiology, biological vitalism, and Ufe in general. In truth, thermodynamics not only put its stamp on scientific thought but influenced, as weU, social and political thought, psychology, literature, history, philosophy, and religion. Aheady in 1863 Sir WiUiam G. Armstrong in his Presidential Address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science remarked that the dynamical theory of heat and the new views on energy (or "force," as it was loosely referred to then) probably con stituted the most important discovery of the century.3 By that time, the principle of conservation of energy had been applied not only to motion, heat, light, electricity, magnetism, and chemical affinity, but also to problems encountered in the world of organic life: ani mal and vegetable heat, digestion, respiration, muscular force, ner vous agency, vital power, the development of organized animal and vegetable structure from dormant, primordial germ ceUs, and the effects of plant and animal sensation and consciousness.4 One of the most widely-read authors on this broad "philosophi cal" subject was the English lawyer and physicist William R. Grove, whose famous Correlation of Physical Forces, first pubhshed in 1846, went through numerous English and American editions and kept the public informed on how the relentless march of the knowledge of various "forces" was solving the new problems of science. Grove remarked that it was highly probable "that when discovered, and their modes of action fully traced out," these forces would "be found to be related inter se, and to these forces as these are to each other." This he beUeved "to be as far certain as certainty can be predicted of any future event." Thus he concluded: Many existing phenomena, hitherto beUeved distinct, wiU be connected and explained: explanation is, indeed, only relation to something more famiUar, not more known?i.e., known as to causative or creative agen cies. In all phenomena the more closely they are investigated the more are we convinced that, humanly speaking, neither matter nor force can be created or annihilated, and that an essential cause is unattain able?Causation is the w?l, Creation the act, of God.5 William B. Carpenter, an eminent and unflagging English in vestigator in the sciences of zoology, botany, and mental physiology, wrote on the correlation of physical and vital forces with a gasconade that surely must have embarrassed the founders of the principle of 1052</page><page sequence="8">Thermodynamics and Religion conservation of energy. In a paper of 1850, Carpenter took up the problem of the mutual relation (metamorphosis and conversion) of the physical forces to the vital processes of plant and animal growth, development, reproduction, and the evolution of complex heterogeneous structures from homogeneous germinal masses.0 By applying the principle of correlation (conservation) of forces to vital phenomena, he hoped to open new lines of inquiry that would invest the physiological sciences with the same dynamic aspects as the physical sciences exhibited.7 The particular modus operandi of "CeU-force" in the ceU-forma tion of plants was compared to "Engine-power," which term, Car penter remarked, was used "knowing that the steam-engine possesses no power itself, but that it is simply that instrument most commonly employed, because the most convenient and advantageous yet de vised, for the application of the expansive force of steam, generated by the application of heat, to the production of mechanical motion."8 Carpenter found the forces in the growth, development, and move ment of animals to be essentiaUy the same as "Cell-force" in plants, except for an additional "Nervous agency" related to the conscious mind, which communicated impressions derived from the external world and was related to the working of contractile tissues in obedience to mental impulses. He wrote: "For, just as electricity developed by chemical change may operate ( by its correlation with chemical affinity) in producing other chemical changes elsewhere, so may nerve-force, which has its origin in cell-formation, excite or modify the process of cell-formation in other parts, and thus in fluence all the vital manifestations of the several tissues, whatever may be their own individual characters." He thus hoped to have estabUshed "the general proposition, that so close a mutual relation exists between all the vital forces, that they may be legitimately regarded as modes of one and the same force."9 As for the relations of the vital to the physical forces, Carpenter proceeded to demonstrate to his satisfaction that "Nervous Force" ("the highest of aU the forms of vital force, both in its relations to mental action, and in its dominant power over organic processes of every kind") is perfectly correlated and mutually convertible with electricity, heat, Ught, magnetism, motion, and chemical affinity. Notwithstanding these physical comparisons, Carpenter retained, as Liebig had, the pre-existence of a living organism necessary for the development of an "organized structure of even the simplest kind." He wrote: 1053</page><page sequence="9">ERWIN N. HIEBERT It is the speciality of the material substratum thus furnishing the medium or instrument of the metamorphosis which . . . establishes and must ever maintain a weU-marked boundary-line between the Physical and the Vital forces. Starting with the abstract notion of Force, as emanating at once from the Divine Will, we might say that this force, operating through inorganic matter, manifests itseff in electricity, magnetism, light, heat, chemical affinity, and mechanical motion; but that, when directed through organized structures, it effects the operations of growth, development, chemico-vital transformation, and the like; and is further metamorphosed, through the instrumentality of the structures thus gen erated, into nervous agency and muscular power.10 Thus, for Carpenter, "aU force which does not emanate from the wiU of created sentient beings, directly and immediately proceeds from the Will of the Omnipotent and Omnipresent Creator." What he caUed "physical forces" were just "so many modi operandi of one and the same agency, the creative and sustaining will of the Deity."11 Carpenter maintained reservations concerning the exten sion of the doctrine of evolution to man s intellectual and spiritual nature, even though he admitted that man had moved by "grades of organic ascent" from an analysis of physical forces such as heat and Ught to an analysis of nervous agency and muscular power. V The energy-conservation principle was used in some fairly un tamed, speculative, and theologically grounded arguments in the works of the physicist Grove and the physiologist Carpenter. But in none of the early expositions of the energy principle did philosophy run riot quite so wildly as in the writings of Herbert Spencer. Spencer was a representative of a widely disseminated naturaUstic interpre tation of phenomena that rested, in his case, upon a strange synthesis of ideas drawn from evolutionary theory, the principle of conserva tion of energy, and a humanitarian, religious metaphysics. He was described by one of his friends as "radical aU over." In the First Principles of 1862, Spencer attempted to reconc?e science and religion on the broad postulate of belief in the Un knowable as the cause of all phenomenal existence. The deepest, widest, and most certain of all facts, for Spencer, was that the Power which the universe manifests to man is utterly inscrutable. Thus, "ultimate scientific ideas" Uke force, space, and time were all repre sentative of realities that could not be comprehended; they passed all understanding.12 1054</page><page sequence="10">Thermodynamics and Religion For Spencer, the scientific idea of "force," rooted in primordial experiences, was the ultimate of ultimates. One did not know, he said, what force as an ultimate was; the law of its manifestations could be inferred from experience, but never derived inductively. This law was the law of conservation of energy. "Persistence of force" was the expression that Huxley had suggested and Spencer preferred.13 In his chapter on "the correlation and equivalence of forces," Spencer added "mental forces" to the same generalization (the same law of metamorphosis) that he recognized as having been enunciated for physical forces on the basis of the experimental investigations of Mayer, Joule, Helmholtz, and Grove.14 Those modes of the Unknowable which we caU motion, heat, Ught, chemical affinity, etc. are alike transformable into each other, and [also] into those modes of the Unknowable which we distinguish as sensation, emotion, thought: these, in their turns, being directly or indirectly transformable into the original shapes. He then added: Of course if the law of correlation and equivalence holds of the forces we class as vital and mental, it must hold also of those we class as social . . . [and] if we ask whence come these physical forces from which, through the intermediation of the vital forces, the social forces arise, the reply is of course as heretofore?the solar radiations.15 Spencer concluded by saying "the deepest truths we can reach are simply statements of the widest uniformities in our experience of the relations of Matter, Motion, and Force; and Matter, Motion, and Force are but symbols of the Unknown Reality."16 Science, as in the unknowable ultimate of ultimates, namely force, coalesced with religion in the "consciousness of an Incomprehensible Omnipo tent Power"?an Absolute Being. Religion and science were, never theless, both rooted in the common datum of all human thought, in the law of the "persistence of force." But the establishment of the correlation and equivalence between the forces of the outer (matter) and the inner (spirit) world, for Spencer, was a matter of the as similation of either to the other, "according as we set out with one or the other term." Related views on force were spelled out by Spencer in the section on "Ecclesiastical Institutions" in the third volume (Princi ples of Sociology) of his Synthetic Philosophy of 1885.17 Here he was concerned with the history of religion and religious in stitutions and the elements of power that entered into all primitive 1055</page><page sequence="11">ERWIN N. HIEBERT religions. Acknowledging elements of power beyond conscious ness, as evidenced in muscular power, ghost force, sun-worship, the powers of medicine men and priests, Spencer concluded that aU religions had a natural genesis that led upward from the most primitive anthropomorphisms to gods, inscrutable, unknow able, and omnipotent. The divinity that was synonymous with su periority eventually became non-anthropomorphic in the idea of force. This idea reached its extreme form in the man of science who could properly interpret the idea of the "persistence of force" in terms of all possible kinds of physical, biological, mental, and ner vous phenomena. Thus, higher faculty and deeper insight raised the sentiments of the man of science to a vision, though dim and incomplete, of ultimate existence. And this feeUng is not Ukely to be decreased but to be increased by that analysis of knowledge which, while forcing him to agnosticism, yet continually prompts him to imagine some solution of the Great Enigma which he knows cannot be solved. . . . But one truth must grow ever clearer?the truth that there is an Inscrutable Existence everywhere manifested, to which [man] . . . can neither find nor conceive either beginning or end. Amid the mysteries which become the more mys terious the more they are thought about, there wiU remain the one absolute certainty, that he is ever in presence of an Infinite and Eternal Energy, from which aU things proceed.18 Ernst Haeckel, a biologist of enormous literary output and Prof es fessor of Zoology at the University of Jena, was a most enthusiastic apostle of Darwinism in Germany. He applied the principle of con servation of energy (in combination with biological evolution) to some of the oldest problems in philosophy and religion. His Die Weltr?thsel of 1899, which appeared in English in 1900 as The Riddle of the Universe, adopted an inflexible, materialistic, monistic position that laid down the intrinsic unity of organic and inorganic nature and propounded the evolution of the highest level of the human faculties from unicellular protozoa. Wh?e Haeckel rejected the immortaUty of the soul, freedom of the w?l, and the existence of a personal deity, he did not, he claimed, reject religion per se. His "monistic religion" with its "monistic church" was, he said, a monism con necting religion and science but freed from the dead and dried-up superstitions of the traditional church religions. In Der Monismus als Band zwischen Religion und Wissenschaft, written in 1892, Haeckel proposed that the most important general consequence of the spiritual conquest of modern science belonged 1056</page><page sequence="12">Thermodynamics and Religion to the law of substance (Substanz-Gesetz)?and that this was to be designated as the first paragraph of the "monistic religion of reason" (i.e., die monistische Vernunftsreligion). In a remarkable essay of 1895,19 Haeckel wrote concerning this law: This supreme basic law of the cosmos actually consists of two intimately related laws: of the "law of the conservation of matter,, for which we are indebted to the great French chemist Lavoisier, and of the "law of the conservation of energy" whose founding is shared by two German intellectual heroes?the South-German Robert Mayer and the North-German Hermann Helmholtz. As "matter and energy" are in separably combined in every thing, so also these two basic "conser vation laws" hang together in one law of substance. For the religion of reason of the science of today this law of substance is just as much the immovable foundation stone as the dogma of the "infallibility of the Pope" is for the CathoUc church of today?the rudest slap in the face for reason.20 Professor Haeckel then ridiculed the behavior of the mourners of the recently deceased Helmholtz. They behaved no better than Darwin's mourners had thirteen years earlier in the pantheon of Westminster Abbey. Haeckel asked whether the highly-respected gentlemen who heard the church bells ring in Berlin for Helmholtz realized that they were honoring "a free-thinker who ought in their eyes to have been a revolutionary, mangy, heretic of the first order." Did none of them know that the greatest contribution of Helmholtz, the 'law of substance," was the first paragraph of the "monistic religion," and that it was connected inseparably with Darwin's in famous "materialistic" theory of evolution? VI Edward L. Youmans, the self-taught American promoter of sci ence education, was an ardent apostle of evolution and a devotee of the Spencerian philosophy. Youmans' influence on American sci entific thought, in his role as a popular lecturer and as editor of the International Scientific Series, was impressive. This still on-going series, which published over fifty volumes during his lifetime, in cluded works by Liebig, Helmholtz, Darwin, and Huxley; Spencer apparently never delivered the manuscript he had promised. You mans, who moved in the circles of William H. Appleton, Horace Greeley, and Walt Whitman, also secured the establishment of the Popular Scientific Monthly. Youmans' compilation of essays on The Correlation and Con 1057</page><page sequence="13">ERWIN N. HIEBERT servation of Forces was published in 1865 to show that scientific inquiries were shifting from questions about matter to questions of force. Material ideas were giving place to dynamical ideas; and Youmans wrote: "It has [been] shown that a pure principle forms the immaterial foundation of the universe. From the baldest ma teriality we rise at last to a truth of the spiritual world, of so exalted an order that it has been said 'to connect the mind of man with the Spirit of God.'"21 Youmans felt that the law of conservation of "force" had un covered "a region which promises possessions richer than any hitherto granted to the intellect of man . . . [having] pressed its inquiries into the higher region of life, mind, society, history and education." The initiation of the "momentous event of inteUectual progress" through the "establishment of a new philosophy of forces," Youmans predicted, would bring about a perfectly correlated, mar velous, dynamic unity of the whole living system. The intercon vertible forces included were mechanical, thermal, luminous, elec trical and chemical forces, organic nutrition, muscular power, sensation force, nerve power, mental force, wiU power, cerebral force, brain force, emotional and intellectual force.22 Thus, he wrote: Impressions made from moment to moment on aU our organs of sense are directly corrrelated with external physical forces. This correlation, furthermore, is quantitative as well as quaUtative. . . . Between the emotions and bodily actions the correlation and equivalence are also equally clear. . . . The intellectual operations are also directly corre lated with physical activities. As in the inorganic world we know nothing of forces except as exhibited by matter, so in the higher inteUectual realm we know nothing of mind-force except through its material mani festations.23 Youmans extended the force notion to include society and social economies as well: The law of correlation being thus applicable to human energy as well as to the powers of nature, it must also apply to society, where we constantly witness the conversion of forces on a comprehensive scale. . . . [Since according to the dynamical point of view there is a strict analogy between] the individual and the social economies?the same law of force governs the development of both. . . . The amount of energy ... is limited, and when consumed for one purpose it cannot of course be had for another. ... So with the social organism; its forces being Umited, there is but a definite amount of power to be consumed in the various social activities. 1058</page><page sequence="14">Thermodynamics and Religion But the force law had still higher bearings: history, the condi tions of humanity, the progress of civflization, and the order of society in terms of the definite quantity of morality, justice, and liberty available. Societal progress, thus, depended upon the balance of these constantly changing ratios among the fixed quantity of the forces present?just as the individual growth of an organism de pended upon the balance of physiological, inteUectual, and passional forces present. "So with society, the measured action of its forces gives rise to a fixed amount of morality and liberty in each age, but that amount increases with social evolution."24 And what was the place of God in this exuberant paean to the conservation of energy? The future of science opened up the infinite, mysterious, worship-worthy Cause of it aU. And if these high realities are but faint and fitful glimpses which science has obtained in the dim dawn of discovery, what must be the glories of the coming day? If indeed they are but "pebbles" gathered from the shores of the great ocean of truth, what are the mysteries stiU hidden in the bosom of the mighty unexplored? And how far transcending all stretch of thought that Unknown and Infinite Cause of all to which the human spirit turns evermore in solemn and mysterious worship!25 Another American scientist, George Frederick Barker, who was some-time professor of chemistry, geology, physiological chemistry, toxicology, and physics at Wheaton College in Illinois, at Yale, and at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as president of the Ameri can Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Chemical Society, accepted, without reservation, the philosophy of the cor relation of vital and physical force, and then managed somehow to twist the whole business to the glory of God. Barker wrote: I would fain beUeve that we now see more clearly the beautiful har monies of bounteous nature; that on her many-stringed instrument force answers to force, Uke the notes of a great symphony; disappearing now in potential energy, and anon reappearing as actual energy, in a multitude of forms. I would hope that this wonderful unity and mutual interaction of force in the dead forms of inorganic nature appear to you identical in the living forms of animal and vegetable life which makes of our earth an Eden. . . . But here the great question roUs upon us, Is it only this? ... Is there really no immortal portion sepa rable from this brain-tissue, though yet mysteriously united to it? In a word does this curiously fashioned body inclose a soul, God-given and to God returning? Here science veils her face and bows in reverence before the Almighty. We have passed the boundaries by which physical science is inclosed. No crucible, no subtle magnetic needle can answer now our questions. No word but His who formed us can break the 1059</page><page sequence="15">ERWIN N. HIEBERT awful silence. In the presence of such a revelation Science is dumb and faith comes in joyfully to accept that higher truth which can never be the object of physical demonstration.26 VII A non-theistic, monistic, and humanitarian exploitation of the philosophy of energeticism as a way of Ufe was expounded in scores of books, pamphlets, and sermons by the renowned German physical chemist and Nobel Prize winner of 1909?Wilhelm Ostwald. In 1913, as President of the German Confederation of Monists, Ostwald delivered a lecture in Vienna that merits attention.27 This lecture admirably demonstrated the anti-religious views of Ostwald with special reference to thermodynamics. Sirnilar views were presented by Paul Cams, philosopher and editor of Open Court and The Monist in Chicago, and by Svante Arrhenius, who received the Nobel Prize in 1903 for his electrolytic dissociation theory. Briefly, Ostwald characterized his brand of monism in this lec ture of 1913 as a doctrine "which excludes all double-entry book keeping, which removes aU barriers, hitherto regarded as insur mountable, between inner and outer life, between the life of the present and that of the future, between the existence of the body and that of the soul, and which comprehends all these things in a single unity that extends everywhere and leaves nothing outside its scope."28 Ostwald maintained that the record of man s past, since the pre Socratic and Greek doctrines of the basic stuff of the universe, re vealed man's attempt to struggle toward a unitary, monistic repre sentation of the world. Thus, the history of ph?osophy was strewed with rejected monistic systems, including one that Ostwald also rejected, namely, the monism of a single supreme God. Ostwald argued that a unified seU-consistent world-view was unattainable by means of any a priori monism. This included the monism of energy?as a principle. The only monism that Ostwald recognized was an a posteriori monism "which proceeds from the diversity of the world as from the data offered by experience." Thus, an a posteriori monism, as the future ideal of unity, was science; it was a monism of scientific thought and scientific method.20 Ostwald's program for scientific monism rested upon the com pletion of a process that he found to be already weU under way, namely, the abolition of the barrier or dividing line that separated the provinces of science and religion. This extremely movable bar 1060</page><page sequence="16">Thermodynamics and Religion rier, Ostwald indicated, shifted invariably in the direction of en larging and expanding the province of science at the expense of the province of religion. Ostwald predicted that the province of religion would become narrower and narrower unt?, reduced to almost nothing, religion would be forced to surrender. Drawing from the work of the "pathfinding psychologist" William James of Harvard University, Ostwald argued that the struggle of the priests against science was one that "always allows us to discern the incessant and irresistible advance of science into the departments hitherto oc cupied by religion."30 As a "specimen of the practical Monism" that man should en dorse, Ostwald mentioned "the irresistible flow toward the interna tional organization of human affairs." Only the movement toward greater unity in all of science, since the introduction and utilization of energy conservation in science, had made this flow toward in ternational organization possible. This was Ostwald's so-called doctrine of the "energetic impera tive." He postulated: "There must evidently be an imperative and decisive moment in the existence of thought, which gives to the principle of unity ... so great an impulse that the whole tendency of human intellectual evolution surrenders to its grasp." This move ment "out of multifariousness to unity, especially out of the many dualisms to the one Monism" was, for Ostwald, symbolized by the "postulate of economy of energy."31 In this manner, Ostwald moved from scientific monism to the principle of energy conservation as the grand unifying principle of science, and finally to an energeticism directive for the practical affairs of man in society. Thus: We know that we all Uve by virtue of the free energy that streams from the sun to the earth like a broad and powerful flood. [Our energetic imperative must avowedly be]: Waste no energy; turn it aU to account. . . . Here, therefore, we have a genuine and far reach ing Monism [which reaches from] the simplest technical trade, yes from the daily acts of our haU-animal Ufe, to the very highest sociologi cal and ethical problems. "The whole culture-evolution," said Ostwald, "which has led us from the invention of the slingstone, the lever, [and] fire ... to a modern giant steamer . . . signifies nothing further than an always finer and more multiform manifestation of the energetic imperative. The same may be said of our moral evolution." And thus, for Ost wald, the whole prophetic quality of science turned on the great synthetic unity of man's expenditure of his ava?able energy. 1061</page><page sequence="17">ERWIN N. HIEBERT Accordingly, at the present time, the principal task of scientific or Monistic thought and labor is manifestly to free the final science in the succession of sciences, sociology, from the hitherto existing influence of the priesthood, and to estabUsh in place of the traditional ethics dependent on revelation a rational scientific ethics, based on facts.82 Ostwald concluded: Proceeding along this pathway of thought, we have come to recognize that the highest values of Christianity, the kindness and love of the individual towards his fellowman, do not yet represent the highest ethical ideal which mankind can attain. Monism leads far more to the perception that the individual is more and more a mere ceU in the collective organism of humanity. Accordingly, the evolution of kindness and love, the evolution of the spirit of seU-sacrifice and devotion to the great whole of humanity, becomes more and more a demand of the energetic imperative, therefore an immanent demand of our whole MonisticaUy ordered Ufe. Only through the fact that we have come to recognize kindness and love as a necessity for community Ufe, for the social organization of mankind, has there also been gained by the individual the sole sure and immovable foundation. That we practise mutual kindness and love is no longer the demand of a Godhead stand ing outside of ourselves, which has once for all transmitted it to us by an unverifiable revelation; but it is a demand of scientific intelU gence. To it, of course, only those can belong who dedicate themselves to Monism unreservedly and without any remnants of dualistic thinking and feeUng. With the increased broadening and deepening of this intelligence we see arrive the Monistic century, which will not remain the only one of its kind. But it will inaugurate a new epoch for humanity, just as two thousand years ago the preaching of the general love for humanity had inaugurated an epoch.33 VIII During the nineteenth century, the meaning of the law of con servation of energy was examined within the context of theological issues deahng primarily with the mode of God's presence and action in the world. The law was commonly invoked to bolster the argu ment for the existence of a Deity who had ordered the world with perfect foresight, wisdom, and economy of action. Thus, matter (the stuff of the world) and energy (the action and process within the nature of things) were accepted as conserved quantities. They were built into a system of nature operating without over-aU matter or energy losses. The argument for a world of law, order, and timeless permanence served theology very weU as long as the laws of science were not seen to be so thoroughly successful in their account of the 1062</page><page sequence="18">Thermodynamics and Religion nature of things as to make God a mere benevolent, absentee land lord. The ph?osophy of mechanism, based on the reduction of phe nomena to matter and motion, had provided a serious threat to theism ever since the end of the seventeenth century. Indeed, deism was the bargain that religion had been disposed to make with mechanism. If God was not directly involved in the operations of nature, it was, nevertheless, still feasible to fall back on the belief that he had made it all in the first place. Unfortunately for Chris tianity, the God in the argument from design, the Divine Mechanic, was something quite unlike the God of the Bible. With the seemingly boundless accomplishments of nineteenth century thermodynamics in explaining the mysteries of inanimate and animate processes in nature, the energy concept, like the philosophy of mechanism, became a threat for those who were un willing to relegate the description and resolution of the workings of nature, down to the smallest details, to the scientist. They con sidered thermodynamics, with its analytical jurisdiction over con versions and redistributions of energy without losses and without divine interference, to be no less tyrannical than mechanism had been. The works of energeticists like Ostwald were a fulmination to aU that traditional religion had held in trust for centuries. Apart from Ostwaldian, monistic, and atheistic energeticism, some in terpretations of the energy concept were viewed as injurious to questions concerning the possibiUty of miracles, the nature of free will, the creation and immateriality of the human soul, and the problem of death and immortaUty. There was an immensely spirited literature on this subject around the turn of the century. A systematic, theological statement on the energy problem came from the Neo-Thomist or Neo-Scholastic study group at the Institut de Philosophie of the University of Louvain. The Institute was estabUshed by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 for the special purpose of teaching the doctrine of St. Thomas together with history and the natural sciences. The newly-created chair in Thomist philosophy was first occupied by the Belgian Cardinal, D?sire Joseph Mercier, influential teacher and author, and editor of the Revue Neo Scholastique.s? The work of the Neo-Scholastics illustrated the criticisms that were leveled against certain historic formulations of the principle of conservation of energy. For example, Helmholtz in his essay of 1862 on the conservation of energy had said that "the quantity of aU forces which can be put into action in the whole of 1063</page><page sequence="19">ERWIN N. HIEBERT nature is unchangeable and can be neither increased nor de creased."35 The first question that could be raised in connection with such a broad statement was: How far did the energy concept reach into vital life processes, the motor or sensory nerve cells of the brain, problems of volition, consciousness, the nature of the human soul, the relation of the soul to the body, questions of moral freedom, and divine interference in the form of miracles? Cardinal Mercier held, for example, that Helmholtz's statement was a hazardous leap from positive science to very speculative metaphysics; that the state ment was beyond the possibility of experimental proof. While the energy-conservation principle obtained for many systems, the Neo-Thomists denied that it had been satisfactorily demonstrated for physiological and psycho-physical systems, con sciousness, the human mind, and the moral law. Spencer's doctrine was erroneous because it converted the "persistence of force" into an absolute. Ostwald's views were false because they rejected matter and defined "energy" so that it took the place of "substance" in aU processes of change?matter thereby becoming the mere capacity for the action of energy. What about the conservation of energy in relation to the human soul? Could the soul or the mind initiate or modify nature by re sultant changes in matter and energy in the world? The Neo Thomist answer to this question was yes. The thoughts, feelings, and volitions of men did influence physical events. The soul was able to act on matter; if not, there would be no freedom of the will. The next question was how did the soul act on matter? By means of particular forms of energy interconvertible with other forms of energy? The Neo-Thomist answer was no; otherwise the soul would be reduced to a form of energy or a mechanism. The soul, therefore, could not act on matter by means of any guiding or directing energy, not even by means of a microscopic hair-trigger pressure movement. The chasms between the two orders of soul and matter were intel lectually impassible. The mechanism of the soul's influence on physical events could only be explained synthetically. The explanation required both sci entific information and rehgious interpretation; the ph?osophy of Aristotle and St. Thomas provided the clue. Thus, Cardinal Mercier reawakened the Scholastic distinction between matter and form; where matter and form nevertheless existed only in conjunction. The "informing principle of substance" and "substance" coalesced in the specific existences which partook of the nature of things. 1064</page><page sequence="20">Thermodynamics and Religion A prominent representative of the Neo-Thomist movement in England was Michael Maher, Director of Studies and Professor of Pedagogics at St. Mary's Hall. Father Maher, S.J., wrote in The Catholic Encyclopedia: The function ... of this active informing principle is of a unifying, conserving, restraining character, holding back, as it were, and sustain ing the potential energies of the organism in their unstable condition. From this view of the relation of the soul to the material constituents of the body, it would follow that the transformation of the potential energies of the living organism is accompanied in vital processes not by anything akin to positive physical pressure, but by some sort of Uberative act. It would in this case suffice simply to unloose, to "let go," to cease the act of restraining, and the unstable forms of energy released will thereby issue of themselves into other forms. In a sack of gas or liquid, for instance, the covering membrane determines the contents to a par ticular shape, and conserves them in a particular space. Somewhat analogously, in the Scholastic theory the soul, as "form," determines the qualitative character of the material with which it coalesces while it conserves the Uving being in its specific nature.36 The theory thus avoided the dualism of body and soul. Body and soul acted as a co-principle, with neither outside the other. The directing influence of the soul was not dependent upon the action on matter of something outside of it. "The soul is in the body which it animates and in every part of it."37 The claim of the Neo-Thomist doctrine for restricting the energy conservation principle to statements that could not go beyond experi mental proof (i.e., that could not, therefore, extend into the domain of man's soul without reducing the soul to matter or energy) rested its case upon the construction of a synthetic philosophy that opened up the possibility of the soul's action on matter. Purportedly this solution, therefore, also solved problems that otherwise remained unanswerable?such as freedom of the w?l, creation of the human soul, and the departure of the immortal soul. Neither creation nor departure was merely a matter-energy coUocation. Neo-Thomist philosophy, consequently, played an important synthetic function in the matter of providing a meaningful synthetic interpretation of the energy concept. On the other hand, the Neo-Thomists insisted that a complete knowledge of the deta?s furnished by the individual sciences was necessary for the synthetic explanations to have any meaning. A thorough-going criticism of the Neo-Thomist interpretation of the energy concept came from the German philosopher Konstantin 1065</page><page sequence="21">ERWIN N. HIEBERT Gutberiet, who was very much preoccupied with the theological proofs for the existence of God. In Das Gesetz von der Erhaltung der Kraft und seine Beziehung zur Metaphysik, written in 1885, Gutberiet attempted to support the substantial form of the energy notion with modern physical arguments. The English physicist and author, Sir Oliver Lodge, who had spoken on behalf of Christian orthodoxy against Haeckel's law of substance (conservation of matter and energy, conjointly), also expressed a view that was at variance with the Neo-Thomists. Lodge, who devoted almost as much effort trying to establish communica tion between the living and the dead as he did in research on electro magnetic problems, believed that matter and ether were substantial things?in fact, the only fundamental realities known to physical science. Energy and force, Uke movement, were mere abstract ex pressions. Life was not energy, but a director of energy and matter; vital force was nonsensical. Nevertheless, Lodge believed that the action of life on matter was analogous to a hair-trigger release of large quantities of energy. He wrote: "So, inasmuch as Uberation of energy can be accompanied by work entirely incommensurate with the result, it would appear that ultimately it can be achieved by no 'work' at all?through the mysterious intervention of the brain as a connective between the psychic and physical worlds, which otherwise would not be in touch."38 Such a view was categorically rejected by the Neo-Thomists as an example of soul acting on body by mecha nistic or energetistic means. IX The second law of thermodynamics raised theological issues of a different character. If the principle of the increase of entropy of any operating system was extended to the world or the universe as a system, then the universe was moving toward a state of maximum probability, a configuration of maximum randomness, a condition of minimum availab?ity of energy. This irreversible process, this unidirectional movement toward disorganization in history (time's arrow), led to a degradation of the energy sources and ultimately to that pessimistic state of affairs, that boredom or Nirvana, that was called the "heat-death" of the universe. Thermodynamics accord ingly predicted an end to everything as a function of time. Such a theory, which injected into the minds of men a majestic dysteleology that would eventuate in the consummation of the world, was bound to unleash polemics from religion. Ends and beginnings? 1066</page><page sequence="22">Thermodynamics and Religion creation's end and origin?were matters that theologians could hardly side-step. What would come to an end? And what consituted a beginning or a creation? The controversial published correspondence that took place in 1933 and 1934 between Arnold Lunn and J. B. S. Haldane39 was representative of criticisms of the theological uses of the entropy principle. Lunn, a Madras-born novelist, was converted to Cathol icism during the course of his correspondence with the evolutionist Haldane, who was then Professor of Genetics at University College in London. In his discussions on "proofs of God's existence," Haldane chose as his target for criticism the first proof of St. Thomas in the Summa Theologica, the argument of the unmoved mover. St. Thomas's philosophy, he concluded, was based on antiquated science and faulty mathematics. For various "physical reasons," Haldane found invalid the second law, which purported to demonstrate that the world could not have existed for all times and which, consequently, might have given new support for the theory of an unmoved mover. According to Haldane, the universe might be spatially infinite, making any argument for finite systems possibly fallacious. Even ff finite, the universe might fluctuate between increasing and diminishing entropies that corre sponded to the running-down and the building-up of the available energy; some apparently irreversible events in a space-expanding universe (such as the radiation of heat to cold bodies) might be reversed in a space-contracting universe.40 All of these physically feasible alternatives excluded the heat-death of the universe. Since they also did not support processes or beginnings and creations, Haldane concluded that the proof of God as first cause or unmoved mover fa?ed by implication. Lunn's reaction to the argument for God from entropy considera tions supported Haldane's criticism?but for a different reason. Lunn responded: "I am reluctant to hitch the wagon of faith to the shoot ing star of scientific fashion. For all we know, relativity and the quantum theory and entropy w?l one day join their predecessors in the limbo of discarded scientific fads."41 Thus, Haldane had no use for supernatural religion, wh?e Lunn had no use for anything but rationaUstic religion?which he used to defend miracles and the supernatural, and to combat naturalism, materialism, evolution, Marxism, and Protestantism. Both seemingly agreed on the irrel evance of entropy considerations to the proof of God's existence: Haldane because he could not, at heart, believe in God; Lunn be 1067</page><page sequence="23">ERWIN N. HIEBERT cause he did not want his belief in God to be tied to the perennially obsolete fashions of science.42 Compare this with the view of Sir Arthur Eddington, astronomer mathematician at Cambridge University. Eddington's conviction concerning what reUgion arises from, while not grounded in a rejec tion of reasoning of the kind Lunn championed, nevertheless rested upon the beUef that the ultimate data for reasoning was given through a non-reasoning process. According to Eddington, this process was founded upon a state of seU-knowledge or awareness of what was given in consciousness. For Eddington, this was at least as significant as what was given in sensation. Eddington repudiated, on the one hand, the "idea of proving the distinctive beliefs of religion either from the data of physical science or by the methods of physical science."43 On the other hand, he did not have so low an opinion of the entropy principle as Lunn had. In his analysis of the relation of entropy to chance coincidences and random elements, Eddington wrote: Entropy continually increases. We can, by isolating parts of the world and postulating rather ideaUzed conditions in our problems, arrest the increase, but we cannot turn it into a decrease. That would involve something much worse than a violation of an ordinary law of Nature, namely an improbable coincidence. The law that entropy always in creases?the second law of thermodynamics?holds, I think, the supreme position among the laws of Nature. If someone points out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell's equa tions?then so much the worse for MaxweU's equations. If it is found to be contradicted by observation?weU, these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation. This exaltation of the second law is not unreasonable . . .; the chance against a breach of the second law (i.e. against a decrease of the random element) can be stated in figures which are overwhelming.44 W?liam Ralph Inge, Dean of St. Paul's in London, approached the second-law problem in a manner radically different from that of Haldane, Lunn, or Eddington. To Inge, an arch reactionary, Chris tian Neo-Platonist, the myths of progress and evolution were anath emas. Just as Lunn had been convinced that Martin Luther was the father of the modern revolt against reason,45 Inge, sometimes called "the gloomy dean," was convinced that the fatal error of Catholic theology had been to find a rationalistic foundation for faith. In God and the Astronomers, Inge undertook to demonstrate that any 1068</page><page sequence="24">Thermodynamics and Religion philosopher or theologian who wished to write on cosmology ("the relation of God to the universe") had to be informed on modern astronomy and physics. The research in these fields, he argued, could no longer be brushed aside as irrelevant to metaphysics or theology. "Science and philosophy," he wrote, "cannot be kept in watertight compartments ."46 God is revealing Himseff to our age mainly through the book of na ture. . . . This knowledge is given to us for a purpose. . . . Science has been caUed . . . the purgatory of religion. The study of nature . . . purifies our ideas about God and reality. It makes us ashamed of our petty interpretations of the world?ashamed of thinking that the uni verse was made solely for our benefit. Thus, Inge suggested that "the man of science worships a greater God than the average church-goer."47 Essentially, Dean Inge warned the theologians not to ignore the scientists. What they were doing was directly relevant to theological doctrines. He felt that the religious and ph?osophical significance of the second law of thermodynamics?that new "G?tterd?mmerung," as Spengler called it?had something to say about the ultimate fate of the world.48 Inge argued that if the universe was running down like a clock, the clock must have been wound up at some specific time. If the second law predicted an end in time for the world, then the world must have had a beginning in time. Thus, Inge could ask, "Is science itseff driving us back to the traditional Christian doctrine that God created the world out of nothing?"49 If the second law led to perdition, Inge was saying, then man must accept it. This was, after all, a very Christian idea. The belief that the species would inherit the earth was hardly a Biblical doc trine. The Bible did not forecast unending temporal progress, nor an evolving God, but rather the blessed hope of everlasting life. "Mod ern philosophy [with Time itseff an absolute value, and progress a cosmic principle] is, as I maintain, wrecked on the Second Law of Thermodynamics; it is no wonder that it finds the situation intoler able, and wriggles piteously to escape from its toils."50 Dean Inge found the second law to be at odds with the theory of evolution. Since the universe was moving toward thermal equilib rium?its heat-death?both biological evolution and the idea of progress were iUusions. The human species had on earth "no con tinuing city," and it should therefore "ascend with heart and mind" to its "citizenship ... in heaven."51 The concept of an "end to man's history" raised a host of ques 1069</page><page sequence="25">ERWIN N. HIEBERT tions that occupied religious scholars for decades. Was it consistent with God's goodness to annihilate creation through the heat-death? What meaning could be attached to any values?in the mind of God?when man's history on earth was terminated? For whom, and in what way, would these values be preserved and manifested? Would real existence reside solely in God when only dead brute matter remained in the world? If so, how could God's wiU and purpose be exercised at all? What, if anything, would then become the appropriate vehicle for the exercise of God's will and his crea tive powers? If creation was one of the symbols of the Creator, then in what way might an eternity of pessimism and doom represent an appropriate image of creation? Did "God," indeed, have any mean ing in a universe that was not an abode for conscious life? And why would God create in order to destroy? The second law seemed to be fatal to any meaningful view of the ultimate relation between the world and inteUigent beings?except, of course, within a metaphysical system similar to the one provided by the Dean of St. Paul's. Inge could simply reply that God was not Umited to forms of expression that feU within the framework of man's knowledge. God could exist, if he so w?led, without man; the world was not so necessary to God as God was to the world. "As a pleasure garden this world may be a fa?ure; but it was never meant to be a pleasure garden."52 The French scientist-ph?osopher-historian Pierre Duhem com mented on the relation between the second law of thermodynamics and religion in 1905,53 when he replied to an article by Abel Rey.54 While discussing Duhem's opinions concerning physical theories, Rey had implied that Duhem's scientific ph?osophy had demon strated that Duhem was a believer. Duhem wrote: "Of course, I believe with all my soul in the truths that God has revealed to us and that He has taught us through His Church. ... In this sense, it is permissible to say that the physics I profess is the physics of a believer." But Abel Rey had meant more than that; he had meant that: The beUefs of the Christian [Duhem] had more or less conspicuously guided the criticism of the physicist [Duhem]; that they had incUned his reason to certain conclusions . . . [that might] appear suspect to minds concerned with scientific rigor but alien to the spirituaUst phi losophy or Catholic dogma; in short, that one must be a beUever, not to mention being a perspicacious one, in order to adopt altogether the principles as well as the consequences of the doctrine that I [Duhem] have tried to formulate concerning physical theories.55 1070</page><page sequence="26">Thermodynamics and Religion This Duhem denied. He was perfectly willing to admit that he was a Christian positivist. "Physics," he wrote, "proceeds by an autonomous method absolutely independent of any metaphysical opinion." Theories had no "abilities to penetrate beyond the teach ings of experiment or any capacity to surmise realities hidden under data observable by the senses." Theories no more had the power to draw the plan of any metaphysical system than "metaphysical doc trines had the right to testify for or against any physical theory. If all these efforts have terminated only in a conception clandestinely postulated, then I confess I have been strangely mistaken about the result to which my work was tending." Before admitting such a mistake, Duhem was anxious to fix his gaze particularly on those parts of his physics in which "the seal of the Christian faith was beUeved noticeable, and to recognize whether against . . . [his] intention, this seal [was] really impressed therein or else, on the contrary, whether an iUusion, easy to dissipate, [had] not led to the taking of certain characteristics not belonging to the work as the mark of a beUever." In any case, "the believer and [the] non-believer [might] both work in common accord for the progress of physical science."56 Duhem supported a physical system positivist in both its origins and its conclusions. According to him, physical theories were not metaphysical explanations; nor were they a set of general laws the truth of which was estabUshed by experiment and induction. Physical theories were artificial constructions that mathematically related abstract notions which emerged from experiment. They were "a kind of synoptic painting or schematic sketch suited to summarize and classify the laws of observation." Thus, as to their origins, the "reflections on the meaning and scope of physical theories were induced by preoccupations in which metaphysics and religion had no part." On the other hand, "they terminated in conclusions which have nothing to do with metaphysical doctrines and nothing to do with religious dogmas." It became crucial, therefore, to define a "theoretical physics for whose progress positivists and meta physicians, materialists and spiritualists, nonbelievers and Christians may work with common accord."57 Duhem felt that his physical system eliminated "the aUeged ob jections of physical science to spiritualistic metaphysics and the Catholic faith"; that is, it denied "physical theory any metaphysical or apologetic import." Accordingly, a principle of theoretical physics could neither contradict nor confirm a proposition formulated in 1071</page><page sequence="27">ERWIN N. HIEBERT reUgion?simply because "there [could not] be disagreement or agreement between a proposition touching on an objective reality and another proposition which [had] no objective import."58 Thermodynamics as a physical principle was no exception to Duhem's rule. He said: In the middle of the last century, Clausius, after profoundly transform ing Carnot's principle, drew from it the following famous corollary: The entropy of the universe tends toward a maximum. From this theorem many a philosopher maintained the conclusion of the impossibility of a world in which physical and chemical changes would go on being pro duced forever; it pleased them to think that these changes had had a beginning and would have an end; creation in time, if not of matter, at least of its aptitude for change, and the estabUshment in a more or less remote future of a state of absolute rest and universal death were for these thinkers inevitable consequences of the principles of thermo dynamics.59 Duhem suggested that several fallacies marred such a deduction: First of all, it implicitly assumes the assimilation of the universe to a finite collection of bodies isolated in a space absolutely void of matter; and this assimflation exposes one to many doubts. Once this assimila tion is admitted, it is true that the entropy of the universe has to in crease endlessly, but it does not impose any lower or upper limit on this entropy; nothing then would stop this magnitude from varying from ? oo to + oo while the time itseff varied from ? oo to + oo; then the allegedly demonstrated impossibilities regarding an eternal life for the universe would vanish.60 More important for Duhem was the objection based on "the very essence of physical theory": "We shall show that it is absurd to question this theory for information concerning events which might have happened in an extremely remote past, and absurd to demand of it predictions of events a very long way off." It was absurd because physical theories were mathematical propositions that represented the data of experiment. "If two dif ferent theories represent the same facts with the same degree of approximation, [then] physical method considers them to have abso lutely the same validity." The scientist was, consequently, free to choose among logicaUy equivalent theories according to considera tions of "elegance, simpUcity, and convenience, and grounds of suit ability which are essentially subjective, contingent, and variable with time, with schools, and with persons."61 Thermodynamics too, in Duhem's system, employed arbitrary theories that were adequate to the job at hand. The predictions of 1072</page><page sequence="28">Thermodynamics and Religion such theories merited a certain degree of confidence, but their logic gave no grounds on which to assert that the predictions of these theories, and not others, would be in conformity with reality. Thus, with respect to any long-term predictions, the principles of thermo dynamics had no unambiguous truth status. Duhem said: We possess a thermodynamics which represents very well a multitude of experimental laws, and it teUs us that the entropy of an isolated system increases eternaUy. We could without difficulty construct a new thermodynamics which would represent as weU as the old thermody namics the experimental laws known until now, and whose predictions would go along in agreement with those of the old thermodynamics for ten thousand years; and yet, this new thermodynamics might tell us that the entropy of the universe after increasing for a period of 100 million years will decrease over a new period of 100 milUon years in order to increase again in an eternal cycle. By its very essence experimental science is incapable of predicting the end of the world as weU as of asserting its perpetual activity. Only a gross misconception of its scope could have claimed for it the proof of a dogma affirmed by our faith.62 Consequently, according to Duhem's view, the scientist needed to know nothing about metaphysics in order to do science, but the "metaphysician should know physical theory in order not to make an iUegitimate use of it in his speculation."63 XI The knowledge of the second law of thermodynamics was in the general scientific domain wh?e some of the enthusiastic supporters of biological evolution were indulging in the nineteenth century's most jub?ant songs of progress. In fact, the mood of sympathy for movements toward greater perfection, which was often read into evolution, infected most of the religiously enUghtened persons during the Victorian reign?not to speak of its spread into the litera ture of ph?osophy, aesthetics, and the poUtical, social, and historical sciences. Evolutionary theory was equated with hope, with the law of progress, the lay creed of men of science; entropy considerations prophesied a pessimism of despair, a future of disillusionment. Spencer could feel empathetic with the energetic concepts and simultaneously identify progress with the increasing complexity offered through evolution. Energeticists like Ostwald stressed those aspects of the second law of thermodynamics that dealt with the 1073</page><page sequence="29">ERWIN N. HIEBERT spontaneous irreversib?ity of time and what it signified for man's progress. Ostwald had in mind, naturally, the element of irreversi bility and progress in the development of culture, aesthetics, morals, and man's store of knowledge. This was the human race's inherit ance; it resulted from man's accumulative and irreversible progress. This was an exploitation of time's arrow that did not dwell on the final, dismal outcome of things. Thus, Ostwald played down the gloomier aspects of the second law by ignoring them completely. References to thermodynamics and religion?some oblique, some not so obUque, and some quite blunt?are to be found in the writings of many scientists. Mayer, Joule, and Colding included theological comments along with their formulations of the first law. John Tyndall, the Irish physicist, attributed a wider grasp and a more radical significance to the doctrine of the conservation of energy than to the theory of the origin of the species. Energy conservation, he thought, "bound nature fast in faith" by bringing vital as well as physical phenomena under the dominion of causal connection. He wrote: "If our spiritual authorities could only devise a form in which the heart might express itseff without putting the intellect to shame, they might utilize a power which they now waste, and make prayer, instead of a butt to the scorner, a potent supplement of noble out ward life."64 Lord Kelvin excluded living organisms in his statement of the second law. Svante Arrhenius, while admitting the universality of the second law, thought that rare exceptions might occur leading to the rebu?ding of worlds?perhaps by some conscious Maxwellian demon. Emile Meyerson concluded that the second law was an obstacle fatal to the mechanical explanation of the universe. The philosophies of Nietzsche, Whitehead, and Russell were not inconsequent on these problems. Henri Bergson called the second law the most metaphysical of all the principles of nature because of its implication of a beginning in time. Freud and Jung took a new look at religious experience with the help of wild ideas and brand new expressions: the energy-laden world waiting to react on man, traumatic neuroses in relation to bound "psychic energy," the Ich Energie as narcissistic libido or desexualized eros, cathectic energy, entropy and the death wish. William James wrote: "Though the ulti mate state of the universe may be its vital and physical extinction, there is nothing in physics to interfere with the hypothesis that the penultimate state might be the millennium. The last expiring pulsa tion of the universe might be?I am so happy and perfect that I 1074</page><page sequence="30">Thermodynamics and Religion can stand it no longer."65 Henry Adams thought the universe had been so terribly narrowed by thermodynamics that history and sociology had to "gasp for breath." The worship of the dynamo had replaced the worship of the Virgin of Chartres. XII If the religious frenzy engendered by the first and second laws of thermodynamics now seems more rash than was warranted, more subjective than was proper, and more trusting in the incorruptibility of truth than seems legitimate, it was nevertheless quite real. This frenzy resulted, in part, because the evolution of thermodynamics was particularly susceptible to logical insecurity. Thermodynamics was formulated before aU the essential physical facts had been accumulated. There were too many exciting overtones to postpone the triumph. Thus, the laws of thermodynamics, adorned by their great generality and seeming invulnerability, appeared to have sprung full-blown from the head of Zeus. The first law was almost a triumph of a priori human thought. The second law lay concealed beneath not only steam-power engineering and thermodynamic efficiency, but also coincidence, chance, probab?ity, equ?ibrium, and irreversib?ity. Yet once formulated, the second law was much more open to potential interpretations that were relevant to matters of religious concern than was the first law. The laws of thermodynamics demonstrate that no matter how good, how secure, or how elegant a scientific theory is, it is never immune to being used in ways that transgress the limits of credulity to the point of sheer ridiculousness?at least in the eyes of subse quent generations. AU kinds of private metaphysics and theology have grown Uke weeds in the garden of thermodynamics. It was inevitable that the second law, which threatened at one point to destroy the universal validity of mechanism in the world, was worthy of serious attention by philosophers, metaphysicians, and theolo gians. This consideration did not last. And so it might be legitimate to ask whether reUgion and science must always have relations with each other. If the answer is yes, we must then ask: What kind of relations? And how is science built into the ceremony and life of religion? The substantive documents that served as the basis for this study were imbedded in words l?ce God, creation, world, origins, time, energy, and entropy. These were used with so many different mean 1075</page><page sequence="31">ERWIN N. HIEBERT ings in the literature that it should not be completely surprising that one and the same set of principles could be manipulated to demon strate such diverse theses. It should remind one of Wittgenstein's dictum: "A philosophical problem has the form: T don't know my way about.' . . . For ph?osophical problems arise when language goes on holidayT We conclude with a passage from an essay that suggested the title for this analysis. With poetic and prophetic complacency, Nietzsche wrote in 1873 in The Use and Abuse of History: [There is] a third way of looking at the past . . . beside the other two [viz. monumental and antiquarian history]. This is the "critical" way, which is also in the service of life. Man must have the strength to break up the past, and apply it, too, in order to live. He must bring the past to the bar of judgment, interrogate it remorselessly, and finally condemn it. Every past is worth condemning; this is the rule in mortal affairs, which always contain a large measure of human power and human weakness. It is not justice that sits in judgment here, nor mercy that proclaims the verdict, but only life, the dim, driving force that insatiably desires?itself. Its sentence is always unmerciful, always unjust, as it never flows from a pure fountain of knowledge, though it would generally turn out the same if Justice herself deUvered it. "For everything that is born is worthy of being destroyed. . . ." Its [life's] past is criticaUy examined, the knife put to its roots, and aU the "pieties" are grimly trodden under foot. The process is always danger ous, even for life; and the men or the times that serve life in this way, by judging and annihilating the past, are always dangerous to them selves and others. For as we are merely the resultant of previous genera tions, we are also the resultant of their errors, passions, and crimes; it is impossible to shake off this chain. Though we condemn the errors and think we have escaped them, we cannot escape the fact that we spring from them. At best, it comes to a conflict between our innate, in herited nature and our knowledge, between a stern, new discipline and an ancient tradition; and we plant a new way of Ufe, a new instinct, a second nature, that withers the first. It is an attempt to gain a past a posteriori from which we might spring, as against that from which we do spring; always a dangerous attempt, as it is difficult to find a limit to the denial of the past, and the second natures are generally weaker than the first. . . . The consolation is the knowledge that this "first nature" was once a second, and that every conquering "second nature" becomes a first.66 This article is based on an address by Professor Hiebert to the Science and Contemporary Society Symposium, held in December, 1965, at the University of Notre Dame in celebration of the centennial year of the CoUege of Science.
