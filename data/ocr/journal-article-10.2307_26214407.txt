<plain_text><page sequence="1">TAKING 'THINGS AS THEY ARE': THE BASIS OF LUDWIG FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION V.B. Hipwell* Introduction In a course of public lectures delivered in Heidelberg during the revolution of 1848, Feuerbach claimed that it was 'Man's true culture and true task to take things as they are'.1 What he meant by this apparently simple idea was that man should accept nature, the parameters or limits laid down by its laws, as the measure of his life and its possibilities. He believed that this prescription was entailed by the trajectory of the modern spirit: the epochal movements of the Renaissance and the Reformation had given a secular and man-centred focus to human interests and aspirations, while modern science had established a framework of naturalistic and empirical norms of enquiry. feuerbach s prescription was directed specihcally at religion. He noted in the same lectures: 'In all other fields man progresses; in religious matters he remains . . . rooted to the spot'.2 He was sympathetic to the Christian religion in respect of what he claimed was its latent human content, and of what he acknowledged as its necessary role in the evolution of the human spirit. But this was a qualified sympathy. In respect of its overt or theistic claims, Feuerbach condemned the Christian religion, as is well known, on the philosophico anthropological grounds that it subjected man to an illusory idealism that alienated him from himself, and from the possibilities of living a truly human * I would like to thank Geraint L.

But Feuerbach was also a political critic of Christianity, a radical for whom Christian religious illusions constituted the normative basis of hierarchical and authoritarian forms of political power. Consequently, he made the case that the primary task confronting radicalism was the exposure and rejection of these illusions. The main aim of this paper is to present a study of Feuerbach's political position. This will include an explication of his account of what he claimed were the shared psychological and cultural roots of religion and the principles of social and political conservatism, as well as of the specific radical political prescriptions that he held were suggested by his advocation of realism. How ever, Feuerbach's primary interest was 'religion ... and everything connected with it':3 his critique of religion was the context and substance of his political utterances. It will, therefore, be necessary to preface this paper with an expla nation of some key ideas of this critique. Much of Feuerbach's ostensible hostility to religion and theology, and the political radicalism that was inseparable from it, can be explained as a response to the peculiar religio-political milieu of Restoration Germany.4 However, as a subsidiary aim of this paper, I hope to show that Feuerbach's objections to Christianity arose initially, and took shape, not from a political impulse, but from metaphysical and philosophical concerns of a rather recondite kind. The substantive character of his mature critique of religion is usually, and rightly, claimed to have arisen from his critique of Hegelian philosophy. But the Christian religion was an object of negative criticism to him prior to his break with Hegelianism. Indeed, on the issue of Christianity, Feuerbach was at odds with Hegel from the outset of his intellectual career. By taking account of Feuerbach's earliest and often neglected writings, I hope to put his mature objections to Christianity into some context of what might be termed perennial Feuerbachian themes. 3 Ibid., p. 5 (Werke, 6, p. 12). 4 The peculiar marriage of evangelical or 'neo-pietist' Protestant religiosity with political conservatism that characterized this period is examined by R.M. Bigler, The Politics of German Protestantism: The Rise of the Protestant Church Elite in Prussia, 1815-1848 (Berkeley, 1972). Feuerbach claimed that all his works had 'been written in opposition to a period when every effort was made to force mankind back into the darkness of bygone centuries', Lectures, p. 10 (Werke, 6, p. 16). Feuerbach's radical views on religion, and especially his irreverent and mocking attitude to 'neo-pietist orthodoxy', expressed in his first published book — Thoughts on Death and Immortality (1830) — early ruined his hopes of pursuing an academic career, Eugene Kamenka, The Philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach (London, 1970), pp. 23-7.</page><page sequence="3">FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 423 Hegelianism and Religion: Feuerbach's Early Position Although Hegel's speculative interpretation of the Christian religion little resembled its traditional understanding, it is true, as Karl Lôwith has noted, that Hegel, especially in later life, 'made the express claim that his was a Christian philosophy'.5 In its Protestant form, he acclaimed Christianity as being the realization of what he termed the 'absolute religion',6 as well as the spiritual mainstay of modem cultural autonomy and political freedoms.7 However, the meaning of Hegel's philosophy of religion, especially in respect of its mediat ing claims, was ambiguous. In describing philosophy's role as being to com prehend what was seen as religion's latent rational content, it was arguable that Hegel's intention was simply to vindicate religion's lasting truth in the judg ment of reason.8 But it was also possible to discern a negative impulse whereby philosophy, having comprehended this content, was understood to supplant religion in respect of what Hegel himself had described as its inadequate figurative conceptual forms.9 Hegelianism became divided into two main schools of interpretation on this issue: the so-called 'right' Hegelians took the first view,10 while the 'left', despite acknowledging religion's former specula tive and historical necessity, affirmed the second.11 5 Karl Lôwith, From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth Century Thought, trans.

HIPWELL Feuerbach's position on this issue was to associate him with the Hegelian left. A student convert to Hegelian philosophy in the early 1820s,12 he was attracted by its acclaimed capacity for comprehending the manifold forms of being as outward appearances of a single Mind or Geist. As a consequence of this conversion, he abandoned theology, his original subject of study, for philosophy. Philosophy was extolled as a liberation from what he described as the crudely figurative, oppressive and outmoded conceptions of theology.13 He appeared to share none of Hegel's esteem for the Christian religion, and affirmed philosophy's relationship to it less in terms of mediation than of critical opposition. This negative appraisal entailed difficulties with some fundamental Hegelian notions: he began to articulate doubts about the idea of the reconcilability of religion and philosophy,14 and questioned Christianity's status as the 'absolute religion'.15 It failed to accord with this appellation because it was said to have misconstmed Spirit in personal and crudely finite terms.16 For Feuerbach, Christianity was inherently dualistic and therefore inconsistent with the unitary conceptions of philosophy. In his first book, Thoughts on Death and Immortality (1830), these doubts formed the basis of a critique of what Feuerbach saw as the fragmented spirituality of contemporary faith. Described as having its roots in the individu alistic culture of Protestantism,17 divine conceptions had become for modern believers identical with their own exaggerated sense of selfhood: 'the single human individual . . . has been perceived as divine and infinite'.18 What contemporary piety expressed was an aspiration for limitless personal being. 1962); Karl Lôwith, From Hegel to Nietzsche.

Only in the imagin ation of another, heavenly world was it possible to believe that the self could exist in perfect freedom.19 In Feuerbach's judgment, modern belief was an egocentric, dualistic and life-denying spiritual perversion. The philosophical premise of the Thoughts was Hegel's speculative idea of identity. Formularized as 'the identity of the identical and non-identical',20 Hegel had posited this idea to describe the dialectical structure of being. The notion of an infinite Spirit was for him not the exclusive definition of a transcendent reality, but of reality as such. The existence of the finite, the apparent exclusion or negation of the infinite, was to be understood as an entailment of Spirit's own immanent logic.21 Like Hegel, Feuerbach identified man as the subject of this Spirit: through man's powers of reason and con sciousness, Spirit, he held, actualized itself as a self-conscious community of being. Man thus existed in the fullest spiritual sense in community with others where he submitted himself, in respect of his purely egocentric or finite interests, to the universal criteria of a shared self-consciousness. This capacity for self-transcendence is epitomized by love, which Feuerbach described as the 'primary . . . self-consciousness in the human'.22 Yet the impulse that moved man to self-surrender at the level of manifest self-eonsrioiisness was helrl to he the same impulse that effected negation at the non-reflective level of nature. For man this negation was most poignantly present in the awareness of death. But negation was a spiritual determination and, as such, it appeared as an extrinsic, fearful and unwilled loss of the self only so long as its speculative significance remained uncomprehended. As man willed the surrender of him self, Feuerbach claimed, through thought, community and love, he should be aware that he was also willing, as it were, the necessity of death as the natural corollary of these higher spiritual possibilities.23 The aim of the Thoughts was to educate man not only to recognize this world as the proper object of his spiritual aspirations, but also to accept the finite 19 Ibid., pp. 11-12 (Werke, l,pp. 191-2). 20 G.W.F.

HIPWELL conditions, especially that of his mortality, that fix and limit his existence to this world, as the necessary elements of a single spiritual reality. Feuerbach discounted the fear that the loss of the prospect of immortality would lead man to despair. Such fears, he suggested, reflected the spurious dualism of contem porary piety for which this life, held to be devoid of the substantive content of a spiritual end, could have no conceivable significance other than that of empty duration or transience.24 Feuerbach's objections to Christianity in the Thoughts prefigured those of his later writings; i.e. its absolutization of the individual vis-à-vis his connections with nature and the community, its fixation upon unreal goals, and its denial of this life and its possibilities for genuine fulfilment.25 One notable element of this continuity was the idea of the redemptive quality of man's acceptance of the finality of death. It was this acceptance, above all else, that was to put man into a right relationship with 'things as they are'. In the mature writings it was held to have politically liberating consequences. However, despite these continuities, the Thoughts differ from the mature writings in two fundamental respects. In the Thoughts, Feuerbach expressed no interest in the politics of his critique: he failed to explore, for example, the question of religion's role in, or influence upon, society or the state. Nor did he address the issue of the role of political and social reform in the transition to a post-cnrisuan ruture. ι ms was a serious omission, since nis summons to value this life as an end in itself could have little appeal to those for whom this life was one of poverty, neglect and oppression. The second difference relates to ontology. Taking 'things as they are' in the Thoughts meant taking them in what was construed to be their speculative significance. Although Hegelian philosophy did encapsulate and confirm the organic system of nature, it clearly subordinated nature to a higher spiritual rationale.26 Feuerbach subsequently rejected the Hegelian speculative view point. In three seminal philosophical critiques appearing between 1839 and 1843,27 he censured Hegel for what he claimed were his uncritical idealist presuppositions in respect of the integrity and primacy of nature and the 24 See ibid., pp. 170-3 (Werke, 1, pp. 402-6) for Feuerbach's celebration of time as the immanent presence and vehicle of eternity. 25 In 1848 Feuerbach noted that the Thoughts 'already contain in the abstract what was fully developed in the later books', Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 14 {Werke, 6, p. 21). 26 See, for example, Feuerbach, Thoughts, pp. 45-8 {Werke, 1, pp. 236-40) where Feuer bach affirms the speculative or 'supersensible' significance of death vis-à-vis its sensible or natural meaning. 27 Towards a Critique of Hegel's Philosophy (1839), Preliminary Theses on the Reform of Philosophy (1842), and Principles of the Philosophy of the Future (1843).</page><page sequence="7">FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 427 senses.28 An important conclusion of these critiques was that Hegelianism was not only incompatible with a non-Christian, non-theological viewpoint, but was itself, by virtue of its idealist ontology, theological in essence. As a consequence of this judgment, Feuerbach interpreted Hegel's philosophical vindication of modem secular culture and science as a last ditch theological strategy to contain the burgeoning forces of modem unbelief.29 Thus, by the 1840s, Feuerbach's critique of Christianity also incorporated a critique of Hegelianism, and his insistence upon taking 'things as they are' in terms of the primacy of nature and the senses represented a direct rebuttal of his own Hegelian past.30 The Basic Themes of Feuerbach's Mature Critique of Religion Despite Feuerbach's rejection of speculative philosophy, much of the theoreti cal basis of The Essence of Christianity ( 1841, revised editions 1843 and 1849), his first mature critique of religion, was recognizably Hegelian. Its most obvious feature, in this respect, was a dialectical model of consciousness entailing the self-objectification of the subject, its loss or alienation, and its repossession by means of philosophical comprehension.31 Feuerbach describes religion as the first and non-reflective form of self consciousness32 in which man projects his 'inner nature ... as an objective, 28 For a full explication of these critiques, see Marx W. Wartofsky, Feuerbach (Cambridge, 1977), pp. 168-95, and pp. 349-86. 29 Ludwig Feuerbach, Preliminary Theses on the Reform of Philosophy, in The Fiery Brook, p. 168 (Werke, 9, p. 258). 30 Feuerbach's critique of Hegel's philosophy, and his conclusion that whoever 'clings to Hegelian philosophy also clings to theology' {ibid., Feuerbach's italics), effectively made left Hegelianism untenable on its own terms. See Marx's comments in appreciation of this conclusion in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, in Karl Marx: Selected Writings, ed. David McLellan (Oxford, 1977), pp. 97-8. •3 1 This model is examined in depth by Wartofsky, Feuerbach, pp. 205 ff. 32 Ludwig Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, trans. George Eliot (New York, 1957), p. 13 (Werke, 5, pp. 46-7). The text of the Schuffenhauer edition is that of 1841, which correlates the variations and additions of the 1843 and 1849 editions — referred to as Β and C respectively — in the form of footnotes. The 1843 edition, which is the edition translated by Eliot, is the one followed in this paper. The most substantive difference between the editions relates to Feuerbach's revision of an apparently restored Hegelian rationalistic influence that was very evident in the earliest edition, see McLellan, The Young Hegelians and Karl Marx, p. 90, and S. Rawidowicz, Ludwig Feuerbachs Philosophie: Ursprung und Schicksal (Berlin, 2nd edn., 1964), pp. 82 ff. Other changes relate to Feuerbach's attempt to make the book less academic, more popular in language and style, and to the addition of material on Protestantism, which became the basis of a separate book on Luther published in 1844.</page><page sequence="8">428 V.B. HIPWELL external being'.33 He defines this 'inner nature' as the consciousness of the infinity of consciousness arising from man's membership of the human species. More concretely, man's nature is synonymous with his conscious powers of feeling, willing and thinking.34The infinity and perfection ascribed to God are, in reality, predicates of man's essence taken in abstraction from his existence, which Feuerbach describes as finite or individual.35 Since God's nature is man's own nature projected as a separate being, man's affirmation of God is simultaneously a negation or loss of his specific powers and qualities. Feuerbach, therefore, sees religious consciousness as inherently alienated: Religion is the disuniting of man from himself.. . God is not what man is — man is not what God is. God is the infinite, man the finite being; God is perfect, man imperfect; God eternal, man temporal; God almighty, man weak... God and man are extremes, God is the absolutely positive, the sum of all realities; man the absolutely negative, comprehending all negations.36 However, this separation or alienation of man from himself is problematic, and thus condemnable, for Feuerbach, only where it has become subject to a conscious and intentional process of ratiocination. Central to Feuerbach's understanding of religion is thus the distinction he makes between religion as such and theology.37 Religion, he claims, is in essence feeling.38 But feeling is coterminus with man's primary orientation to the world, which Feuerbach specifies, as will be shown in the next section, as sensuous, need-centred and practical. Thus, in expressing specific feelings — e.g. love, fear, veneration — the meaning of religion is always circumscribed by the primarily sensuous, this-worldly, and anthropocentric foci of feeling as such. Anthropomorphism and personification are therefore seen by Feuerbach as the characteristic forms of the religious imagination. Moreover, since feeling has no reflective capacity, 33 Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, p. 198 (Werke, 5, p. 337). 34 Ibid., pp. 3 ff. (Werke, 5, pp. 30 ff.). 35 'the antithesis of divine and human ... is nothing else than the antithesis between the human nature in general and the human individual', ibid., pp. 13-14 (Werke, 5, pp. 47-8, and footnote 2, p. 48). 36 Ibid., p. 33 (Werke, 5, p. 75). 37 Feuerbach, in fact, describes the separation of man from his nature in its purest religious expression as a 'harmless separation' ('harmlose Scheidung'), ibid., p. 197 (Werke, 5, p. 335). His conception of alienation is complex and often ambiguous, and only its barest outline can be given in this paper. For its full and sustained analysis, see Wartofsky, Feuerbach, Chs.

In the first place, it is the application of reason to religion for the purpose of 43 d. it is no longer representative of 'a merely relative, but a noumenal being ... a real existence apart from belief, feeling, and thought'.44 Feuerbach explains this transformation in terms of man's consciousness of his rational powers as this arises within the objectified milieu of religion. Theology represents its object, reason, as a distinctive and transcendent power, because reason taken in abstraction from its basis in sensuousness appears as a distinctive and transcen dent power.45 Feuerbach condemns theology because he believes that its influ ence undermines the anthropocentric essence of religion, and thereby radicalizes the phenomenon of alienation. Theological abstraction transforms the idea of God into a being not only qualitatively different to man, but antithetical and antagonistic to him, because what 'is excluded from God, is thereby declared to be something godless, opposed to God'.46 The affirmation of God thus becomes a direct and conscious denial by man of the impulses and needs inseparable from his flesh and blood humanity. Feuerbach condemns theology for putting man 'into conflict with his nature', for poisoning 'the blood in his veins... for his mere impulse to be a man'.47 He identifies the most acute expression of this alienation with what he describes as the consistently -5Q Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, pp. 14 ff.

HIPWELL theologized milieu of medieval Catholicism.48 This was overcome by Protes tantism, which, Feuerbach claims, in seeking to assimilate Christianity to an exclusively Christocentric perspective, reunited it with its more purely relig ious or anthropocentric meanings.49 Even so, the Protestant solution to the problem of alienation'could not be a radical one', because it arose from within, and was thus a continuation of, the inherendy alienated perspectives of 'theo logy or religion themselves'.50 Feuerbach's sympathy for religion has thus to be qualified by the degree to which he saw it as a naive and unreflective affirmation of man. It is clear that he believed such religion had long ceased to exist, since as man becomes advanced in reason, the influence of theology becomes inescapable.51 More over, Feuerbach's sympathy for religion was qualified by his belief that it belonged properly to earlier, ruder societies. He associated religion not only with a milieu of ignorance, superstition and 'barbarism',52 but also with the perpetuation of these traits of cultural backwardness in more civilized times.53 This negative appraisal arose largely from what he saw as the nature of religion's practical function. 48 The essence of medieval Christianity, according to Feuerbach, was 'theology', its object being an 'abstract God . . . who is other than human', Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, p. 336 (Werke, 5, p. 600). What made medieval Catholicism a consistent whole, for Feuerbach, was that it established, through the ethos of the 'merit' system of grace, epitomized by the monastic virtues, this abstract divine conception as the normative ideal of life and morality, ibid., pp. 327-30 and 336-7 (Werke, 5, pp. 590-6 and 600-1). 49 Protestantism, Feuerbach claims, is 'Christology, i.e., (religious) anthropology', for it God is 'no longer ... an abstract... being, but a being of flesh and blood', ibid., pp. 336 and 337 (Werke, 5, p. 600). However, the key idea of this humanization is not simply the Protestant claim that Christ is the sole legitimate focus of faith, but its connection with a conception of grace resting upon the insistence, made especially by Luther, of the 'for our sake', 'for the sake of us men', of Christ's redemptive sacrifice. For Feuerbach, this insistence had a truly heaven-storming significance: he believed that it not only made redundant the abstract and essentially otherworldly normative basis of Catholic morality, but made the attributes traditionally associated with the idea of God's independent existence — as inspired by theology — relative and supremely man-centred; i.e. God became a being omnipotent for man's sake, good or loving for him, etc., see Feuerbach, Luther, pp. 46 ff. (Werke, 9, pp. 364 ff.). 50 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 291 (Werke, 6, pp. 325-6). 51 'With the progress of time... theology coincides with religion', Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, p. 30, footnote (Werke, 5, p. 71, footnote 3). 52 Feuerbach, Lectures, pp. 209 and 213-17 (Werke, 6, pp. 234-5 and 239-43). 53 Ibid., pp. 213 and 215-17 (Werke, 6, pp. 239 and 242-3). In Feuerbach, Fragments, p. 289 (Werke, 10, p. 174), he claims that 'Christianity is the Middle Ages of mankind. That means that we are still living in medieval barbarism'.</page><page sequence="11">FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 431 The Practical Basis of Religion For Feuerbach, religion is pre-eminently practical in character, because human nature, which it expresses and affirms, is primarily practical in its disposition to reality. The basis of this disposition is man's concern to secure the satisfac tion of the needs — described as being primarily sensuous, concretely specific and affective54 — necessary to his preservation and well-being. The peculiarly man-centred and this-worldly quality of religion, noted in the previous section, is thus reflective of the underlying realism of this practical orientation. In the writings of the later 1840s, Feuerbach put these ideas into an explicitly stated naturalistic perspective. Man's practical impulse is there identified directly with egoism, which is explained as the reactive expression of a 'feeling of dependence', arising from need, and corresponding to his objective relationship of dependence upon nature.55 Egoism, 'inherent in the very organism', is identified primarily with the instinct of self-preservation.56 But in its more uuiij&gt;v^iuu2&gt; cApicsMuiis», il is assuuiaieu wiiii wnai is termeu me anve to happiness'.57 Although Feuerbach was not systematic in his elaboration of these ideas, his intention of explaining them in terms of the drives and impulses that he believed connected man to nature was clear enough. Feuerbach describes the specific practical impulse of religious projection as the wish: the gods exist primarily to secure the ends of wishes. The freedom of the gods vis-à-vis nature is the freedom of man's subjective or feeling essence — of which wishes are the specific practical articulations — combined with the unconstrained exigencies of fantasy.58 Insofar as the primary aim of religion is to control nature for the purpose of resolving needs, Feuerbach claims that it expresses the same practical impulse as modern science and industry. However, whereas the former is seen as a praxis of wish-fulfilment and imagination, the latter is characterized as one of labour combined with the knowledge of 54 Feuerbach, Preliminary Theses, pp. 163-4 (Werke, 9, pp. 253-4). 55 For a clear statement of the 'feeling of dependence', see Ludwig Feuerbach, The Essence of Religion, trans.

HIPWELL objective processes.59 Religion signifies, for Feuerbach, then, man's powerless ness in respect of securing his ends by realistic and rational means.60 For Feuerbach, this naturalistic account of the practical basis of religion is directly confirmed by an examination of nature worship or polytheism. Nature worship is a special case for him, because he sees it as the first religion.61 Being therefore free from the influence of reflection and abstraction, he believes that it self-evidently affirms — in respect of its objects, and what he claims is its reference to a directly sensuous and naturalistic order of need — man's essential continuity with nature, and the primacy of the senses.62 Not surpris ingly, Feuerbach's attitude to nature worship is one of sympathy, even em pathy.63 Its explication is the source and inspiration of his prescription 'to take things as they are',64 and he believes that its case directly validates the claims of abstraction and alienation that he makes against the Christian religio theological and speculative imagination.65 Christianity In contrast to his earliest writings, Feuerbach pays Christianity the Hegelian compliment of being 'justly . . . called the absolute religion'. In the image of the Incarnation, he claims that it has brought the human content of all religion into one exhaustive focus.66 Christianity is seen as the culmination of an evolution of religious conscious ness in which man has become increasingly directly aware of his essence, its infinitude and perfection, in abstraction from sensuous reference to nature. The basis of this evolution is explained as a historico-cultural shift from man's earliest condition of direct dependence upon nature, to a dependence increas 59 Ibid., pp. 40-1 (Werke, 10, p. 40); Feuerbach, Lectures, pp. 207 ff.

The Christian 'desires ... an existence ... in which he will be removed from all the needs and necessities of nature'.68This desire — in effect, for unlimited subjectivity or personhood — can be met only in the imagination of a future supernatural life. The Christian God, according to Feuerbach, is both the personification of this desire, and the means posited by the imagination that fulfils it. That immortality is the basis of the Christian religion can be cor roborated, he believes, by an examination of its classic doctrines. Just two of these will be noted here. The doctrine of the creatio ex nihilo is, for Feuerbach, the culminating point of Christian supernaturalism. It supports immortality in the following way. If nature is held to be a self-subsistent reality, there is no basis for the hope that man's fate is not tied up with it. Only where nature is revealed to be onto logically subordinate to subjectivity can the fulfilment of the Christian desire be assured. The notion of God as a transcendent, absolute person making the world from nothing fits this requirement perfectly.69 However, the most striking support for immortality is to be found in the doctrine of the Incarnation. God's direct representation as a man establishes beyond doubt the conviction that humanity and its aspirations are not alien to Him. Christ reveals God's essence to be sympathy or love for man. His death confirms both his humanity and God's love, whilst the Resurrection translates this love into the unconditional certainty of the believer that he too will prevail 67 The three most important factors explaining this shift appear to be as follows. (1) The development of social solidarity, along with the rise of ethical and political consciousness, through the growth of large and cohesive units of population such as towns, cities and nations; Feuerbach, The Essence of Religion, pp. 44 ff. (Werke, 10, pp. 43 ff.). (2) Man's growing capacity for securing the means of life through practical innovation, and the consequent detachment of religious significance from large areas of purely naturalistic need; Feuerbach, Lectures, pp. 209 ff. {Werke, 6, pp. 235 ff.). (3) The growth of man's intellectual capacity for abstraction; i.e. his power, as it were, to detach himself from, or rise above, the sensuous immediacy of nature; Feuerbach, The Essence of Religion, pp. 49 ff. {Werke, 10, pp. 48 ff.). Feuerbach's account of religious development and history, it must be said, is sketchy, unsystematic and conventional in tone. The latter is particularly evident in his cursory and unflattering account of Judaism, see Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, pp. 112-21 {Werke, 5, pp. 205-19); see also Wartofsky's comments, Feuer bach, pp. 319-21. 68 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 233 {Werke, 6, p. 261). 69 Ibid., p. 234 {Werke, 6, pp. 262-3).</page><page sequence="14">434 V.B. HIPWELL over death and nature.70 Feuerbach sees Christ as the capstone of Christian supernaturalism, the ultimate confirmation that reality is subordinate to the ends of feeling, wish or subjectivity. The secret of Christian belief is thus 'the infinite self-certainty of man ... that his own subjective being is the objective, absolute being'.71 For Feuerbach, Christ personifies what he sees as the inherent contradiction of Christianity, which he describes as the 'unity and the opposition of God and man'72 or, put another way, as 'the contradiction of faith and love'.73 Because, as noted earlier, Feuerbach claims that Protestantism assimilated Christianity to Christology, he believes that this contradiction has become the explicit focus of modern belief. Protestantism identified God's being with his being for man in Christ as a self-sacrificing, humane or loving being. But as religion, it could express this anthropocentric affirmation only in the form of theism, as faith. Love and Faith Feuerbach defines man, by virtue of his shared essence, as a social being:74 the human individual or Τ exists only in reference to a counterpart, or 'thou'. This other-directedness is expressed objectively through language, law, industry, etc. Love is its inner or affective bond, which Feuerbach claims originates in, and is best exemplified by, the shared feelings of need arising from sexual differentiation. But all relationships, he claims, insofar as they express the individual's want of others to complete the self, are authentic expressions of love.75 As an expression of sensibility, love is specific in respect of its objects. But in its underlying or essential meaning, Feuerbach maintains that it signifies man's need for the unifying bond of humanity itself.76 In general terms, then, love constitutes the subjective unity of man and, as such, Feuerbach attributes to it the source of the moral disposition.77 But, because love is the quintessential expression of the humanity of subjectivity and feeling, and since man's essence is the especial object of Christianity, it was inevitably celebrated by Christians as a divine quality. However, as a consequence of this reification, according to 70 For Feuerbach's most comprehensive explication of this doctrine, see Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, Chs. 1V-V and XIV-XV (Werke, 5, pp. 101-30 and 240-62). 71 Ibid., p. 127 (Werke, 5, p. 229). 72 Ibid., p. 332 (Werke, 5, p. 559). 73 /bid., Ch.

But because Christianity divorces man from his connections with nature and the community, it inflates this self-love to infinite proportions. The heavenly state, according to Feuerbach, is thus 'only my ego . . . freed from all dependency, necessity, obligations, and ties .. . Blessedness is the supreme essence of Christian (that is, supernatural) self-love ... the essence of faith, as distinguished from love and considered according to its ... aim, is simply the essence of self-love'.80 The Moral Basis of Feuerbach's Objections to Faith At one level, Feuerbach's objections to faith echo those of earlier liberal critics of dogmatic belief such as Lessing. He censures faith for being destructive of the natural moral solidarity of mankind, through its promotion of a particular supernatural unity of believers.81 Christian love, he claims, is conditional and exclusive, it is a love that embraces only Christians.82 Moreover, since faith is attached to a particular divine conception, upon which hinges the believer's hope of salvation, its attitude is essentially intolerant: 'Nothing ought to subsist . . . which does not acknowledge God, which does not acknowledge faith'.83 This prescription — or wish — Feuerbach claims is fulfilled by the idea of hell, which serves also to vindicate a special Christian sense of self-righteousness.84 For Feuerbach, then, divisiveness, bigotry, arrogance85 and enmity are elements intrinsic to faith.86 78 Ibid., pp. 263-9 (Werke, 5, pp. 435^3). 79 Ibid., pp. 260-1 (Werke, 5, pp. 429-31). 80 Feuerbach, Luther, p. 116 (Werke, 9, p. 412). 81 Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, p. 326 (Werke, 5, p. 587). 82 Ibid., p. 254 (Werke, 5, pp. 419-20). 83 Ibid., p. 256 (Werke, 5, p. 424). 84 Ibid., pp. 256-7 (Werke, 5, p. 424). 85 Ibid., pp. 249-50 (Werke, 5, pp. 413-15). 86 With the rise of Christianity, 'National differences . . . disappeared; but in their place difference of faith, the opposition of Christian and un-Christian, more vehement than a national antagonism, and also more malignant, made its appearance in history', ibid., p. 268 (Werke, 5, p. 441). For Feuerbach, the historic cruelties of the Church arose inevitably from what he describes as faith's inherently 'malignant principle'. That Christianity no longer</page><page sequence="16">436 V.B. HIPWELL In addition to objections of this kind, Feuerbach develops a more substantive argument. In this he seeks to stand on its head the Christian claim that without faith man cannot be moral. He argues that faith has no intrinsic moral signifi cance, because morality and love are meaningful only in respect of man's relations on the inter-human plane. Faith relates to an object and an end — as posited by unfettered egoism — which lie outside this sphere.87 That faith is not just separate from morality, but opposed to it, Feuerbach claims, is borne out by the belief that the worst sin is not lack of love, but lack of faith, unbelief.88 Love is the especial object of Christianity, but its moral authenticity has been wrecked by the theistic perspective of faith: the Christian does good 'not. . . from essentially virtuous dispositions. It is not love, not the object of love, man, the basis of all morality, which is the motive of his good works. No! he does good... for the sake of God'.89 Because faith has annexed love to itself as its own special property, it has Dromoted a moralitv that Feuerbach condemns as beina not onlv boeus. but profoundly conservative.90 Moreover, since faith subordinates morality-love to an unreal goal of felicity, it also makes subordinate what he claims is the true agenda of love; i.e. the resolution of real want, such as that arising from social injustice. Thus Feuerbach's moral objections to faith dovetail into objections of a broader social and political nature. The Politics of Feuerbach's Critique of Religion Although Feuerbach supported the aims of the revolution of 1848, he was profoundly sceptical about the possibility of its success: in terms of both the political and ideological conditions in Germany, he believed it was premature.91 persecutes heretics and unbelievers is indicative not of any inherent potential for a more liberal spirit in faith — Feuerbach is dismissive of the claims of liberal theology — but, rather, to a weakening of faith arising from the independent growth and oppositional pressure of a secular, scientific and more sceptical culture, see ibid., pp. 321 ff. (Werke, 5, pp. 578 ff.). 87 Feuerbach, Lectures, pp. 297 ff., see especially the footnote on p. 301 {Werke, 6, pp. 332 ff., and footnote pp. 337-8). 88 Ibid., pp. 297-8 (Werke, 6, pp. 332-4). 89 Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, p. 262 (Werke, 5, p. 433). 90 'Christians to this day oppose all radical, all thoroughgoing civilization, for a Christian can conceive of no morality, no ethical human life, without God', Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 212 (Werke, 6, p. 238). 91 For a consideration of Feuerbach's attitude to, involvement in, and retrospective assess ment of, the events of 1848, see Melvin Cherno, Ludwig Feuerbach and the Intellectual Basis of Nineteenth Century Radicalism (Ph.D. Thesis, Stanford University, 1955), pp. 167-85.</page><page sequence="17">FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 437 Nonetheless, he was a committed radical for whom the striving for political liberty was the predominant practical drive of contemporary history.92 How ever, he held that the dissolution of the Christian religion was the 'indispensable condition' of attaining this goal. Failure to meet this condition, which he clearly thought was the major shortcoming of 1848, would render 'all political and social reforms... meaningless and futile'.93 Yet, Feuerbach was convinced that its necessity was becoming generally understood, because religion, in the context of the rising tide of radicalism, was revealing its true character by openly aligning itself with conservative political forces.94 Contemporary man was learning directly 'that... Christianity is poison to his political energy'.95 Feuerbach believed that his critiques had a direct contribution to make to the political struggle. In the first place, by demonstrating the human content of religion, they constituted a liberation of man's conscience from what he claimed was the inherently conservative influence of faith, theology and the churches. In the second place, they suggested the normative basis and justifi cauun ui îauiccuibiii b uwn punu^ai guaib. vvny wab rcucruauu bu liibibiciil about making political emancipation conditional upon man's emancipation from religion? Some insight into this question may be gleaned from his comments on the liberal demand for religious freedom within the context of a secular state. He argued, much as Marx did in On the Jewish Question, that the disengagement of the state from religion would not, of itself, eradicate religious intolerance, bigotry and divisiveness, the causes of which, as noted above, he held were intrinsic to faith: Ί . .. don't care a farthing for a political freedom that leaves me enslaved to my religious prejudices'.96 Political freedoms that leave man's real situation out of account, by leaving religion intact, are for Feuerbach chimerical: man can be free only where the illusions which distort his nature, and circumscribe his possibilities for a truly human life, have been p.raHirntpH 97 For Feuerbach, conceptions of political power and authority have been historically inextricably linked to religious conceptions. Most characteristic of this link has been the idea of God as a royal being — i.e. as the world's ruler, law-giver and punisher of offences. This politicization of religious conceptions, he claims, was reflective of the politicization of mankind during the period of its transition from prehistory to antiquity. As man became domiciled in larger 92 Feuerbach, The Necessity of a Reform of Philosophy, in The Fiery Brook, p. 148. 93 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 217 (Werke, 6, p. 243). 94 Feuerbach, Necessity of a Reform of Philosophy, p. 148. 95 Ibid., p. 151. 96 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 218 {Werke, 6, p. 244). 97 Ibid.</page><page sequence="18">438 V.B. HIPWELL and denser units of population, organized increasingly as states, his dependence became felt directly in political terms; e.g. as a citizen, subject, slave. Thus the power of nature, the original focus of dependence, gave way to, and became expressed in terms of, political power.98 However, religion is itself about power; i.e. the power— essentially of man's imagination — to resolve needs. Feuerbach suggests that it is the conception of divine power, especially of its modus operandi, determined in respect of its nature by the order of needs it addresses, that establishes the normative basis and parameters of political power. His contrasting interpretations of ancient religion and Christianity may help to make this point clearer. The norms of political power in antiquity were established within the religious context of polytheism or nature worship. Consequently, the scope of divine power was confined to parameters laid down by a naturalistic order of need. The gods were seen as controllers or rulers of nature — i.e. intervening in, or changing its course, in specific ways — but not as its creators. Hence, they were represented, in political terms, as limited, not absolute monarcns . ι ne case is durèrent in respect of Christian monotheism. Because the Christian is a supernaturalist, his needs and wishes have created the necessity of a conception of absolute or unconstrained divine power, as exemplified by the idea of the creatio ex nihilo. The power of the Christian God, as seen earlier, is the reified power of subjectivity. Feuerbach identifies its specific modus operandi as the word, or the command, which links it unmistakably in his mind, in its purest political form, to 'despotism' or absolute monarchy.100 98 Feuerbach, The Essence of Religion, pp. 44 ff. (Werke, 10, pp. 43 ff.). 99 Ibid., p. 49 (Werke, 10, p. 49). 100 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 191 (Werke, 6, pp. 215-16). Feuerbach's position on constitu tional monarchy — or 'monarchy attenuated by .. .democratic institutions', as he describes it, ibid., p. 149 (Werke, 6, p. 168) — is that it represents an intermediate political form between absolute monarchy and democracy corresponding to modern liberal and rational ideas of God, which he describes as 'theism attenuated by atheism or naturalism', ibid. Although, for Feuerbach, constitutional monarchy is obviously an advance on its 'despotic' counterpart, it is clear that his strictures on absolute monarchy, to be examined shortly, are applicable, in principle, there too — see, for example, his comments on the issue of power in this respect, in ibid., pp. 148-9 (Werke, 6, p. 168). Feuerbach, however, considered himself to be a political realist, and noted, in conformity with Aristotle's categorization, that the best possible state in given circumstances is not necessarily the best one as such. Consequently, Feuerbach was prepared to acknowledge, in the context of contemporary political and ideological conditions, constitutional monarchy as the most reasonable politi cal form, while the 'democratic republic' was the one most 'consonant with human nature and therefore best', ibid., p. 336 (Werke, 6, pp. 379-80). But, as noted above, constitutional monarchy is characterized by elements of democracy, and it is these, when presumably there exists a sufficiently strong democratic political will on the part of citizens, that can be expanded, and made to 'lead ... to true and complete democracy', ibid., p. 149 (Werke, 6, pp. 168-9).</page><page sequence="19">FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 439 Feuerbach seeks to demonstrate the connection of political with religious notions of power, in the case of Christianity, by means of a series of analogies. For Christians, he claims: 'God ... is ... an absolute, unrestrained monarch who does what he pleases, who is "above the Law", but makes his arbitrary commandments into laws for his subjects, regardless of how contrary such laws may be to the subject's needs. 'im The term 'subjects' is here taken to denote the constituent elements or powers of nature from which God, in the Christian imagination, stands apart, and over which, as the author of nature, He has the power and the right to change at will. This hierarchical notion of power is mirrored in the institution of political monarchy. The king governs as a 'special being', set apart by virtue of the mystique of 'blood', 'different in kind' from the people he governs 'as is God from the world'.102 But it is the nature of this power, as Feuerbach sees it, that most strikingly demonstrates the connection of the divine monarch to his political counterpart. God, as the creature of the boundless wish or desire, 'can do everything ... He is unrestricted'.103 His distinctive modus operandi is the miracle, the wish fulfilled immediately by the word.104 Feuerbach describes the political monarch as being similarly able, in his own sphere, to command acts contrary to the nature, needs, will and dignity of his subjects: he can command their deaths, enslavement and humiliation, command them to 'eat straw' if he so wishes.105 'Does not a monarch, or at least an aosoiute monarcn , asics reueroacn, perform just such miracles in the realm of politics as God in the realm of nature?'106 How does Feuerbach explain the psychological basis of the compliance of subjects with such 'despotic' forms of political power? Religion, considered according to its latent practical aim, is concerned with resolving the needs upon which man's preservation, well-being and happiness are dependent. But this aim is to be secured by the imagination of a supra-human power. In the first place, as Feuerbach sees it, man's attitudes and feelings towards divine power are simply reflective of those that characterize his primary state of dependence upon nature, e.g. fear, powerlessness, superstitious dread.107 In the second place, the transference effected by the religious imagination from dependence upon nature to dependence upon the gods, gives rise to a second set of attitudes 101 Ibid., p. 137 (Werke, 6, p. 155). 102 Ibid., pp. 138-9 (Werke, 6, p. 157). 103 Ibid., p. 136 (Werke, 6, p. 154). 104 Ibid., pp. 136-7 (Werke, 6, pp. 154-6). 105 See ibid., p. 138 (Werke, 6, p. 156) where Feuerbach gives specific historical examples of unnatural acts commanded by monarchs. 106 Ibid. 107 Ibid., pp. 219-22 (Werke, 6, pp. 245-9).</page><page sequence="20">440 V.B. HIPWELL and feelings. According to Feuerbach, being dependent upon divine power, for the purpose of securing the ends noted above, renders man self-abasing, obsequious and servile in respect of the objects of that power. Moreover, he claims that these attitudes, arising from man's most deeply felt desires, fears and wishes, come to colour and predispose his attitudes and feelings in areas of life not directly connected to religion.108 In the context of where man's feeling of dependence is mediated by politics, Feuerbach suggests that his feelings and attitudes to divine power become attached to the visible figures and repre sentatives of political power. He believes this is confirmed by evidence sug gesting that in origin politicized religion was expressed as the direct deification of rulers, vestiges of which, he claims, are to be found in the continued use of divine attributes in royal titles.109 Thus, for Feuerbach, the power that binds man's conscience to monarchical politics is rooted in the same feelings and attitudes that characterize his relationship to divine power; e.g. fear, depend eiiue, awe anu veiieiaiiun υι iiieraiciiy, sciviiiiy. ivian Liiruws nimseii on nis knees before his gods; but he does the same before his rulers110 ... to this day Christians address their princes with as much servility as anyone has ever shown a god.'111 The idea of divine kingship, according to Feuerbach, 'rests on ignorance of nature';112 its sole basis is fantasy. Nature, he claims, supports neither the principle of absolute power nor hierarchy. What then would be a politics commensurate with nature? To answer this question, he postulates a theory combining a conception of natural law with a broadly utilitarian explanation of human behaviour. In the former, he seeks to establish what might be termed the metaphysical basis and parameters of a fully secularized politics. In the latter, he suggests the principles of an empirical political science utilizing the same elements of human nature, its universal drives and impulses, already identified by the critique of religion. Feuerbach's conception of natural law is derived largely from his under standing of the normative assumptions of science. The term law is taken to cover what is seen as the general logic of causality, though in the populist idiom of the Lectures the argument is presented in the form of 'how nature really works'. As the subject of this law, nature is described simply in terms of the material world, or as 'bodily . . . sensuous existence'. Since, however, this is 108 Ibid., pp. 224-6 (Werke, 6, pp. 251-3). 109 Ibid., pp. 225-6 {Werke, 6, p. 253); Feuerbach, The Essence of Religion, pp. 45-6 {Werke, 10, p. 45). 110 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 225 {Werke, 6, p. 252). 111 Ibid., p. 226 {Werke, 6, p. 253). 112 Ibid., p. 140 {Werke, 6, p. 158).</page><page sequence="21">FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 441 the only form of existence that Feuerbach allows, the term nature is for him identical with the notion of being or reality as such.113 In brief, natural law is taken to describe nature as a system of mutually interacting causal elements or powers, the economy of which is seen to require the conception of no primary or external cause in respect to which the operation of the whole is made intelligible or coherent. Nature, as the sum of existence, works all at one level: a self-sufficient totality in which cause and effect are relative and interchangeable variables.114 Feuerbach's use of the term natural law is intended, in the first place, as a descriptive statement of the modus operandi of nature. However, his primary interest in this idea relates to what he sees as its prescriptive political application.115 The fundamental political lesson of nature, for Feuerbach, is republican ism.116 This lesson is entailed by his claim, noted above, that nature's intel ligibility is not dependent upon a conception of a supra-natural governing principle or cause, jusi as meoiogy is supernuous 10 an understanding or nature, so is it possible, even for a mankind historically habituated to the idea of monarchy, to conceive 'of a state or nation without a royal idol situated outside and above it'.117 Nor is nature compatible, he claims, with the kind of political power that he associates with monarchical government. Nature is all of one piece; its modus operandi is intelligible only when conceived in terms of an immanent and uniform logic of interactive and mutually dependent causal powers. Consequently, it can support neither groundless effects (i.e. as caused by an agency outside the system), nor the production of effects which contradict preceding causes; that is, miracles can neither occur in, nor be produced by, nature. Thus, the claims of unrestrained or unaccountable power in politics, 113 Ibid., p. 143 (Werke, 6, p. 162). 114 Ibid., pp. 100-3 (Werke, 6, pp. 114-18). 115 Feuerbach seems not to worry about the problem of inferring statements of value from statements of fact, nor about the possible arbitrariness of such a procedure — this peculiar blind spot in his political thought will be discussed below. Neither is he troubled by the traditional theistic associations of the term 'natural law'. This is because he believes that the idea of God acting 'in accordance with natural laws' is an essentially irreligious idea; a God constrained by nature in this way 'is a God only in name; in content He does not differ from nature'; ibid., p. 149 (Werke, 6, p. 169). Actually, Feuerbach believes that the theistic underwriting of natural law represents an absurd compromise of belief with secular philosophy, which rests on the ignorance of the real — or practical — basis of religion, the essential modus operandi of which is the miracle-wish; see ιbid., pp. 235-44 (Werke, 6, pp. 263-73). 116 Ibid., pp. 100-1,136-7 and 139 (Werke, 6, pp. 115-16, 155 and 157-8). 117 Ibid., pp. 100-1 (Werke, 6, p. 115).</page><page sequence="22">442 V.B. HEPWELL which, as noted above, Feuerbach equates with the power of miracles in the sphere of religion, have no basis or justification in nature.118 Nature, in Feuerbach's judgment, is compatible only with the politics of republicanism, democracy and egalitarianism. Making a simple physiological analogy, he notes that bodies 'can be reduced to nerves and blood. But a nerve is nothing without blood, blood is nothing without nerves; thus in nature... all things are equally important, equally essential.'119 The political lessons are clear: in nature there is no privilege, all elements 'need... each other... work together, and... enjoy equal rights'.120 In this vein, Feuerbach infers a number of specific radical principles such as popular election, representative govern ment, popular accountability, and the rule of law conceived as the expression of the popular will.121 Taking 'things as they are', then, was a prescription with clear and specific political connotations. Feuerbach noted that 'just as the republic is the historical task, the practical goal or man, so his theoretical goal is to recognize the republican constitution of nature'.I22ln the wake of the failure of 1848, and the collapse of hopes of further direct political action, he found solace in the belief that this theoretical recognition, the essential prerequisite of radical political change, would continue to grow apace. The progress and growing public awareness of the sciences was the basis of this optimism. In a review of Molescholt's Theory of Nutrition, 'Natural Science and the Revolution' (1850),123 Feuerbach argued that by excluding science from the purview of censorship, the political status quo was being myopic in respect of its own interests. Science was effecting a quiet revolution by promulgating in the public mind the radical lessons of nature. In contrast to the closed and hierarchical world of contemporary society, shored up by the illusions of religion, science was fostering a spirit that was in essence progressive, open-minded, egalitarian and even communistic. Of course, a political reading of nature of this kind has to be subjective to a large degree. Feuerbach, perhaps more than anyone, was aware of man's 118 Ibid., pp. 137-9 (Werke, 6, pp. 155-7). 119 Ibid., p. 137 (Werke, 6, p. 155). 120 Ibid. 121 See ibid., pp. 137-9 (Werke, 6, pp. 155-8). 122 Ibid., p. 101 (Werke, 6, p. 115). 123 Die Naturwissenschaft und die Revolution, in Werke, 10, pp. 347-68.

Why then was he not more circumspect in his own case? Some part of the answer may lie in Feuerbach's admiration for science. He was profoundly optimistic about its capacity for bettering humanity's material and intellectual condition. Espe cially significant was his appreciation of the scientific mind itself, which he saw as inherently tolerant and even-handed in its attitude to the world. Feuerbach's political reading of nature can be seen as a projection of such 'liberal' and 'democratic' traits and values that he associated with the scientific temper.124 However, there is another explanation which may help to account more gener ally for Feuerbach's enthusiasm for the principle of taking 'things as they are', of which his political reading of nature was just one expression. His general attitude to nature often appeared to owe less to a scientific than a romantic sensibility. His earlier treatment of nature in the Thoughts had been profoundly pantheistic in tone. There, nature was construed as embodying spiritual mean ings, and man's fulfilment and happiness were to hinge upon his recognition of this immanence of the spiritual in the natural. Something of this attitude persisted in the mature writings. Nature is often described as being sympa thetically attuned to the ends of mankind, its well-being and happiness. It was lauded as the one sure antidote to man's ills and confusions, even described to the Doint of anthronomorohism. as man's comforter teacher and mother 125 That nature should also be described as offering political lessons that would secure universal justice can be seen as an expression of this essentially poetic and reverential attitude. Feuerbach's radicalism in the earlier 1840s was derived from his conception of the human essence, often supported by borrowings from the Hegelian Rechtsphilosophie.m In the mid 1840s, however, his philosophical outlook became more emphatically naturalistic. This shift was to have a profound effect on the character of his ethical and political views, of which the preoccupation with natural law was one expression. Man's behaviour was explained increas 124 Feuerbach describes atheism as being intrinsically 'liberal, open-handed' and demo cratic to the degree that it 'acknowledges every being's will and talent'; Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 283 (Werke, 6, p. 318). This is a fair summary of the political lessons of nature, but it also describes the scientific temper, especially as he reads it in 'Natural Science and the Revolution'. Elsewhere, he explicitly noted the identity of atheism and science, at least in respect of the letter's practical or working assumptions; Ludwig Feuerbach, Principles of the Philosophy of the Future, trans. Manfred H. Vogel (Indianapolis, 1966), pp. 22-3 (Werke, 9, pp. 285-6). 125 See Feuerbach, Lectures, pp. 37-8 (Werke, 6, pp. 45-7). Feuerbach's admission to feelings of empathy for nature worship, noted earlier in this paper, also bears out this peculiar attitude to nature. 126 See Feuerbach, Necessity of a Reform of Philosophy, p. 150; and especially Feuerbach, Preliminary Theses, p. 172 (Werke, 9, pp. 262-3).</page><page sequence="24">444 V.B. HIPWELL ingly in terms of the physiological and psychological drives that were claimed to be expressive of his organic connection with nature. The earlier perspective of the human essence, along with the idea of love that was seen as integral to it, was not abandoned, but assimilated to the new emphasis.127 What was also conveyed in these writings, in conformity with a stronger appreciation for the empirical and the concrete, was a more differentiated view of humanity. In his ethical explanations, Feuerbach appealed less to the idea of a unifying love, than to what he described as the 'difference between me and thee'.128 An important consequence of this change was that it allowed him to give a conflictual account of politics and political change. For Feuerbach, political behaviour is an expression of man's more general practical disposition to reality. As noted earlier, the primary category of this disposition is egoism, which, in its most fundamental expression, is identical with the pre-conscious orientation of the organism to preserve itself. However man is not only a natural being, but also, and specifically, a social being, for "ΐιυιιι νυν» » WllV/llj ·' VII U11U IIU^/^IIIVIJU Ml V VI1UU V-Ml 1 V*1 11V/1 1M1 UIV fulfilment of social needs or, in the language of the Ί-thou' relationship, the needs of love. However, where Feuerbach continues to employ the term love, it is with the proviso that it is to be understood as an extension of the individual's primary self-love.129 Egoism, then, is identified as the underlying normative principle of politics and the state.130 Individuals seek to affirm and defend the interests arising from their self-love, and in so doing strive to restrain the self-love of others. Since individuals are both I and thou, they are forced in turn to submit to restraints upon their own self-interests.131 Thus, in general terms, states and laws are the products of the complex interactions of individuals, each in pursuit of the ends of his own self-love. However, this simple and abstract model of political behaviour is complicated by the social dimension alluded to above. The primary egoism of the individual dovetails into what Feuerbach suggests are larger societal categories of self-interest. He notes the existence of what he vaguely terms 'social egoism', but also family, corporate, community and 127 This change in perspective has been explained with some plausibility by reference to the undoubtable impact and influence upon Feuerbach of Stirner's The Ego and Its Own (1844), see Lawrence S. Stepelevich, 'Max Stirnerand Ludwig Feuerbach', Journal of the History of Ideas, XXXIX (1978), pp. 451-63). 128 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 303 (Werke, 6, p. 340). 129 Ibid., pp. 50 and 78 (Werke, 6, pp. 61 and 90-1). 130 Ibid., pp. 303-5 (Werke, 6, pp. 339-42). 131 'My egoism may permit me to steal, but my fellow man's egoism will sternly forbid me', ibid., p. 303 (Werke, 6, p. 340).</page><page sequence="25">FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 445 patriotic forms.132 There is even noted the existence of apparently opposed feminine and masculine egoisms.133 It has to be said that this is the weakest area of Feuerbach's political theorizing. Not only does he fail to explain adequately these categories of self-interest, but he fails even to differentiate clearly their socio-historical from their purely natural bases: all are described unhelpfully as the many 'aspects of human nature'.134 This omission is especially unfortunate in view of the fact that, as will be noted shortly, he sometimes characterizes social and political change in a language surprisingly suggestive of Marx. But Feuerbach did not develop an analysis of the historical, social or economic frameworks that would have helped to concretize his broader application of the notion of self-interest. His political thinking here, although suggestive, failed to amount to more than a rather mechanical extension of notions arising from his critique of religion. It is now possible, on the basis of the preceding account of Feuerbach's his interpretation of natural law. He is not always explicit about the connection of these two elements of his political thought, and some interpretative licence will be taken in the following brief discussion. According to Feuerbach's understanding of nature, there is no basis for claiming the superior status of any one causal element or group of elements. The interests arising from egoism are natural — i.e. they are the particular expressions of drives which connect man to nature — and are thereby subject to natural law. Consequently, there is no justification in nature for the promotion of the interests of any one particular group in society at the expense of other groups. Thus, democracy is the only legitimate form of government, because it counts, in the form of the popular □ 11 unite r&gt;f OOAiem onliolli; U/MimnA·· suggests a subsidiary utilitarian argument. Democracy actualizes in the politi cal sphere what might be called the functional virtues of nature's own regime, which Feuerbach characterizes in terms of unity, harmony and cooperation.135 Consequently, it is the best form of government in respect of securing stability and effectiveness in the execution of its political ends, since by taking account of all interests equally, it comes closest to harmonizing the particular interests of society with its general or political interest. Other forms of government, in failing to meet the requirement of equality, must inevitably become the focus of resentments and grievances, which not only damage their effectiveness in 132 Ibid., p. 304 (Werke, 6, p. 341). 133 Ibid., p. 303 (Werke, 6, p. 340). 134 Ibid., p. 304 (Werke, 6, p. 341). 135 Ibid., pp. 136-9 (Werke, 6, pp. 154-8).</page><page sequence="26">446 V.B. HIPWELL securing their political ends, but also ultimately threaten their destruction.136 The sense of justice which Feuerbach, in common with Aristotle, seems to take as an essential attribute of a viable state, can be secured only by democracy. Thus democracy is intrinsically right because it is justified by nature, but it is also right in instrumental terms, because in conforming to nature it is the form of government that works best. Despite his emphasis on egoism, Feuerbach clearly believes that there is more that unites humanity than differentiates it. What makes men strangers to one another is not egoism as such, but the inordinate egoism of the religious imagination. In the Lectures, on the rare occasions where he describes love in distinction to self-love, love continues to be viewed as the inner bond uniting humanity.137 Feuerbach was, as a consequence, free of the fear and distrust of popular democracy that haunted many of his liberal contemporaries,138 since he was convinced of the essential moral solidarity and decency of man in the mass. Yet, in the Lectures he justifies democracy ostensibly on the grounds, not of humanity's shared essence, or of love, but of a majoritarian conception of self-interest arising from egoism. This conception, supported by the implicit assumptions of natural law, constitutes both a criterion of political justice as well as an explanation of what Feuerbach sees as the perennial impulse of revolution, which he describes in its contemporary manifestation in terms strikingly redolent of the Communist Manifesto: the good is merely what falls in with the egoism of all men, and evil is simply what falls in with the egoism of certain classes of men at the expense of others, but the egoism of all, or at least the majority, is always more powerful than that of the minority. One glance at history is suffi cient. When does a new historical epoch set in? Always when a repressed mass or majority asserts its justified egoism in opposition to the exclusive egoism of a nation or caste, when classes of men or whole nations triumph over the arrogance and presumption of a patrician minority and so emerge from the darkness of the despised proletarian mass to the light of historical 136 'States disintegrate only where the egoism of a class or of individuals ceases to recognize the egoism of other men and of other classes as equal', ibid., p. 78 (Werke, 6, p. 90). 137 Ibid., p. 109 (Werke, 6, p. 125).

In the same way, the egoism of the now oppressed majority of mankind must and will come into its own, ushering in a new historical epoch.139 However, Feuerbach was less concerned with developing specific agenda of political change, than in seeking to expose the illusions of religion that were 'poison to . . . political energy'. One important intention behind his political thought was to expose what he saw as the conservative claim that religion was the bedrock of states and laws, that without faith 'morality... loses all firmness and authority'.140 He claimed that only in the imagination can religion be described as the basis of states, in reality this basis was to be sought in the mundane exigencies of self-interest.141 States exist not because of religion but because they are the products of the ineradicable impulses and drives of human nature, and because men are not self-sufficient but socially dependent beings. However, the form that political power takes in a society, Feuerbach main tainpH will HpnpnH pmpiiall ν nnnn thp pvictpnpp r»r nr*n_pvictpn^p /-xf roliftirvr» He believed that religion tended always to the service of the powerful and the privileged, those 'who have devised ... freedom for themselves but servitude for others, enjoyment for themselves but resignation for others'.142 Religion, as seen above, was described as the sole justification of political hierarchy, of the exclusive possession of power by individuals and castes. Furthermore, religion makes subjects servile and acquiescent in respect of the injustices they suffer. Thus, for Feuerbach, religion was unavoidably the primary object of critical opposition in the political struggle. 139 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 307 (Werke, 6, p. 345). Unlike Marx and Engels, however, Feuerbach does not advocate the abolition of private property as the end of this emancipa tion of the masses. For him, the solution to the problem of social injustice is to be sought in the radical redistribution of property, along with the provision of universal education, ibid., pp. 307-8 {Werke, 6, p. 345). 140 Ibid., p. 305 (Werke, 6, p. 342). 141 See ibid., p. 304 (Werke, 6, pp. 341-2), for Feuerbach's comments about Bavaria, Prussia and Russia; states which, he claims, contrary to their evident religiosity, owe their preservation less to piety than to the large revenues generated by the beer and liquor trade. More generally, Feuerbach claims that states owe their preservation, in reality, not to the moral power of religion, but to the more tangible power arising from their monopoly of the means of physical coercion or violence; ibid., pp. 302 and 305 (Werke, 6, pp. 338-9 and 342). 142 Ibid., p. 303 (Werke, 6, p. 340).</page><page sequence="28">448 V.B. HIPWELL The Second Confrontation with Immortality For Feuerbach the practical root of the Christian religion is to be sought in the desire for immortality. Thus, to persuade man to give up faith hinges upon persuading him to give up this desire. Feuerbach approaches this task of persuasion by seeking to show not only that the desire for immortality is spurious, but that it has negative consequences in respect of man's capacity for creating the conditions of real happiness in this life. As seen earlier, Feuerbach explains what he sees as man's primary practical disposition in exhaustively naturalistic terms. Its proper content, therefore, in respect of the needs and desires that characterize it, is circumscribed by the parameters of nature. Desires that transcend these parameters are illusory; i.e. they correspond to the existence of no objects other than those posited by the imagination. He claims, therefore, that believers only imagine they desire 'heavenly, immoderate happiness', when what they really desire, and would be conscious of desiring if cognizant of their real situation, is 'earthly, moderate happiness'.143 Moreover, by positing man's ends in terms of imaginary desires, Christianity blocks the satisfaction of his real and attainable desires: 'By promising man eternal life it deprived him of temporal life ... it destroyed his faith in a better life on earth and his striving to attain such a life. Christianity gave man what his imagination desires, but for that very reason failed to give mm wnat ne really ... desires. Feuerbach suggests that Christianity represses man's natural practical in stincts in two ways. Firstly, by positing a supernatural goal as his essential and unconditional want, it deprives man of a real and active want of this life. Seen from the perspective of heaven, this life is absolutely, and therefore unimprov ably, defective.145 Secondly, because supernatural desires can be met only by the imagination of a supernatural means, man's concern for his own good can be expressed only as a passive faith in a power other than his own.146 The religious mode of praxis, as Feuerbach sees it, functions classically as a compensation for man's incapacity to secure his own well-being and happi ness.147 He suggests that much of the popular basis of Christianity can be seen in this light as expressing the desire for a future other-worldly redress for the 143 Ibid., p. 281 (Werke, 6, p. 315). 144 Ibid. 145 See, for example, Feuerbach, Luther, pp. 122-3 (Werke, 9, p. 422). 146 This point is made indirectly in Feuerbach, Lectures, pp. 281 and 283—4 (Werke, 6, pp. 315 and 318). 147 See note 60, above, for references.</page><page sequence="29">FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 449 perceived deprivations and injustices of this world.148 Yet the situation of modern man differs profoundly from that of his forebears in that he possesses the intellectual and material means, through science and industry, that make possible the resolution of all his real and attainable desires.149 But if these means are to be developed and utilized for the fullest benefit of mankind, Feuerbach claims that mankind must adopt an uncompromising spirit of real ism, man-centredness and solidarity of purpose that runs directly counter to, and thereby necessitates the abandonment of, faith.150 But is there not a serious obstacle to Feuerbach's task of persuasion in that the immortality desire is expressive of a natural, and thus ineradicable, human dread of death? His theory of egoism, in which the instinct of self-preservation is the fundamental category — implying that a keen fear of death has a primary functional utility — appears to confirm the existence of such an obstacle. Feuerbach's attitude to death, however, was somewhat ambivalent.151 In the 1830s he had noted that the 'painfulness' of the idea of mortality was itself no 'proof of its falsity', but concluded that 'the idea of our finitude is painful only 148 Feuerbach, Lectures, pp. 281-5, passim (Werke, 6, pp. 315-20). More generally, Feuer bach noted that one 'must be a slave here, otherwise heaven is superfluous'; Feuerbach, Necessity of a Reform of Philosophy, p. 152. 149 Feuerbach believed that in the modern period, the essentially imaginary and wish fulfilling praxis of religion was in a state of terminal decline. Mankind was not only discovering other, realistic and reliable means of resolving its needs but, most damaging of all for Christianity, its perception of need itself was becoming focused upon this-worldly, realistic and attainable goals; see Feuerbach, Necessity of a Reform of Philosophy, pp. 146-9. The situation of religion in the modern world, according to Feuerbach, was one of contradiction to the expectations and norms of science, industry and secularism. He most frequently described religion's continued existence as a historical-cultural habit of mind or idée fixe; Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, p. xliv (Werke, 5, p. 26). In Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 216 {Werke, 6, pp. 242-3), he indicated that the basis of this fixation could be explained by the persistence of superstition and ignorance. However, Feuerbach sometimes also suggested that the persistence of religion was explicable as a conservative political strategy of the ruling class: 'What is the surest sign that a religion no longer possesses inner vitality? The answer is: When the princes of the world stretch their arms to put it back on its feet.' Feuerbach, Fragments, p. 289 {Werke, 10, p. 175). In Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 215, footnote {Werke, 6, p. 242, footnote), he noted: 'religious deception ... is ... the foundation of the Christian throne and altar. Is it not, for example, an obvious swindle still to represent the Bible to the people as the word of God after all the theologians ... have found out about it in their investigations.' 150 Feuerbach, Lectures, pp. 284-5 {Werke, 6, pp. 319-20). 151 Feuerbach has been characterized by neo-orthodox Protestant theologians, most notably by Karl Barth, as a 'non-knower' of death; see V.B. Hipwell, The Influence of Lutheranism, Modernity, and Hegel, pp. 316-27 for a critical evaluation of Barth's judg ment on Feuerbach, along with some brief comments on some other, more conventional, theological arguments levelled against him.</page><page sequence="30">450 V.B. HIPWELL as long as we are not accustomed to . . . it'.152 In the concluding Heidelberg lecture, he was extremely optimistic: since the desire for immortality was spurious, its renunciation would be painless.153 As in the Thoughts, he indicates that the idea of death is a problem only for the inordinate egoism of faith, for which man's fmitude is construed as an imperfection or limitation to be overcome. Consequently, the desire for immortality is illusory, and because it ignores the real finite parameters of man's existence, it is also contrary to man's natural feelings about death. Indeed: 'man would become thoroughly sick of living eternally ... In reality man wishes merely to avoid a premature, violent, or gruesome aeam. cveryming nas lis measure ... in me ena we weary or everything, even of life; a time comes when man desires death.'154 Thus, the lesson of nature is reassuring: 'there is nothing frightening about... death'.155 Yet, in the same work, Feuerbach attributes to the awareness of death a primary causal status in the psychology of religious projection, and describes it as 'the most sensitive, most painful of man's feelings of finiteness'.156 However, it is clear that where Feuerbach's position appears to imply a more pessimistic attitude, he believes that it is religion, in offering man comfort, that exacerbates his natural apprehensiveness about death by representing it as an alien or supernatural fate. This, he claims, is especially evident — and terrifying — in the idea of original sin, which seeks to explain the existence of death as a consequence of divine anger and retribution.157 The perspective of nature renders such horrors absurd. This perspective, which accepts mortality as an integral element of humanity, may not, in accordance with Feuerbach's more pessimistic views on the matter, eliminate the fear of death entirely, but it will at least de-mystify it and allow man to face it stoically.158 However, for Feuerbach the most persuasive argument for renouncing im mortality was his belief that it would, by liberating man's practical instincts from the repressive influence of an unattainable and imaginary goal, result in his self-conscious and active striving to attain a better life in this world.159 He indicates that this practical consequence would be felt primarily in the political 152 Feuerbach, Fragments, p. 279 (Werke, 10, p. 164). 153 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 277 (Werke, 6, p. 310). 154 Ibid., (Werke, 6, p. 311). 155 Ibid., pp. 277-8 (Werke, 6, p. 311). 156 Ibid., p. 33 (Werke, 6, p. 41); see also Feuerbach, Luther, p. 126 (Werke, 9, p. 425). 157 Feuerbach, Luther, pp. 126-7 (Werke, 9, pp. 425-6). 158 Feuerbach himself, if one is to believe him, came to such an acceptance of the inevitability of his own death with apparent equanimity, Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 36 (Werke, 6, p. 44). 159 Ibid., pp. 283-4 (Werke, 6, p. 318).</page><page sequence="31">FEUERBACH'S OBJECTION TO THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION 451 sphere, since, in the context of the modern world, it is no longer nature as such that keeps man needy and dependent, but the structures of political power. Feuerbach suggests that for society's poorest and most neglected classes, immortality met a special psychological need in that its prospect justified to them, and thereby made bearable, the miseries and humiliations of their daily lives. The immortality belief thus kept the mass of humanity quiescent and in its place, and in this respect it was of great conservative political utility, especially in an age marked by popular political and social discontent.160 His message to the poor is uncompromising: the redress of injustices is to be had only through 'the determination, the active striving to remedy them', because heaven 'always comes too late', giving succour to 'the hungry after they have died of hunger'.161 What he claims the poor must understand is that it is precisely the immortality hope that prolongs their misery. For Feuerbach the conviction that this life is the only life, the sole opportunity man has for justice and happiness, was an essentially revolutionary conviction.162 The hierarchical structures of nower and nrivilecrp, rnnld nr&gt;t Ιηησ survive in his vi™ thn macs rejection of the illusions that he believed have traditionally been their mainstay. The attainment of the good life then, according to Feuerbach, depends upon man's willingness to accept the realism of 'things as they are', and especially of the finality of death. He does not think that he is asking man to accept an alien truth, since he believes that this realism is already present and familiar in the perceptual presuppositions and norms of the modern world: 'Only now, in the modern era, has mankind arrived again — as once in Greece after the demise of the oriental dream world — at the sensuous, that is, the unfalsified and objective perception of the ... real.'163 Conclusion Taking 'things as they are' was the indispensable principle of Feuerbach's political radicalism.164 The relatively sparse and often sporadic quality of his 160 See note 149, above, for Feuerbach's comments on the preservation of religion as a conservative political strategy. 161 Feuerbach, Lectures, p. 284 (Werke, 6, pp. 318 and 319). 162 I bid., pp. 283-4 (Werke, 6, p. 318). 163 Feuerbach, Philosophy of the Future, p. 60 (Werke, 9, p. 326). 164 Feuerbach appears to have been unaware of the possibilities of an unintentional conservatism arising from his principle; see, for example, Engel's scathing comment on his remarks concerning the rate of child mortality, in Engels to Marx, Mid-October 1846, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Collected Works, Vol. 38 (London, 1982), pp. 75-81, p. 78.</page><page sequence="32">452 V.B. HIPWELL political utterances has been well noted by his critics.165 To Feuerbach, how ever, it was clear, for the reasons examined in this paper, that a genuine popular political impulse for radical change would come about and be sustained only through a revolution in man's perception of reality, which meant, principally, through the exposure and overthrow of the illusions of religion and theology. Thus, for him, the primary task confronting mankind was seen not in terms of the formulation of comprehensive political critiques and strategies but, more fundamentally, of the formulation and propagation of 'a new view of the first elements and foundations of human existence'.166 The classic Marxian view holds that Feuerbach, in concerning himself so centrally with consciousness or ideology, and especially with religion, failed to grasp what was described as the real economic and social roots of injustice. Consequently, his brand of radical ism was said to offer no real purchase for meaningful social and political strategies of change.167 Passing over the question of the role of ideas in history, UI U1 WI1CUICI lVla.1 A UI1UCI CMllIlcUCU U1C11 JJUWCI 1UI CiiCLlil lg, U1 1 CM 3111 Ig, change, it is clear that Feuerbach never discarded the Hegelian conviction of the essential connectedness of epochal historical change with changes in religious consciousness.168 In the Lectures, he offered an explanation of his preoccupation with religion that stands as an excellent summary of the broader intentions that informed his life's work: Whereas hitherto misunderstood religion . . . has been the supreme principle of politics and ethics, from now on, or at some future date, religion properly understood, religion seen in terms of man, will deter mine the destinies of mankind. It was this aim, an insight into religion that would promote human freedom, independence, love, and happiness, that determined the scope of my historical treatment of religion. Everything that was irrelevant to 165 Marx complained in 1843, while still enthusiastic about Feuerbach, 'that he talks too much about nature and too little about polities', K. Marx and F. Engels, Gesamtausgabe (Berlin, 1927-), I. i. 2, p. 308, cited in McLellan, The Young Hegelians and Karl Marx, p. 113. A similar complaint was echoed four decades later by Engels, 'for Feuerbach politics constituted an impassable frontier', Frederick Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy (Moscow, 1946), p. 37.
