<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD M. GALE From the Specious to the Suspicious Present: The Jack Horner Phenomenology of William James There is, to put it euphemistically, a "tension" between James's accounts of our perception of time in the chapters "The Perception of Time" and "The Stream of Thought" in his 1890 The Principles of Psychology (hereafter PP). The former presents the specious present account?that each pulse of per ceptual experience has a content that comprises a succession of discrete, that is, numerically distinct or separate, events. The latter liquifies these succes sive events so that they melt and fuse together, thereby denying their dis creteness. Subsequent to the Principles of Psychology and its Briefer Course (PBC) version of 1892, which contains abridged versions of these two chap ters, James never speaks of the specious present by name in any published work.1 In his final two works, A Pluralistic Universe (PU) and Some Prob lems of Philosophy (SPP), he emerges as a full-fledged Bergsonian, although he does not explicitly disown his earlier account of the specious present. It should raise one's suspicions that each of these accounts is supported by appeal to what is introspectively or phenomenologically vouchsafed. In each case, the phenomenology is faked and gives a blatantly distorted ac count of our way of experiencing time. James, like so many phenomenolo gists, is a Jack Horner, able to pull out of his phenomenological pie what ever is philosophically required. The reason these conflicting accounts pull out different philosophical plums is that they address a different datum whose presumed existence must be shown to be possible. The specious-present account is an attempt to an swer the psychological question of how it is possible for us to have, as we certainly seem to, the conceptions of temporal precedence and the past; the answer it provides is that temporally successive discrete events are the con tent of a single act of perception, thereby satisfying the concept empiricist's demand to give a concept an experiential birth certificate. The stream-of thought account, in contrast, begins with the undoubted reality of change THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY, Vol. XI, No. 3, 1997.

GALE and addresses the metaphysical question of how change is possible; the an swer it provides is that change must be a processual kind of flowing glop in which temporal neighbors do not possess a distinct identity but instead fuse and melt together. By faking their phenomenological credentials, both analy ses obscure the fact that they really are transcendental deductions of the this or-nothing variety. Since the specious-present doctrine is the one that even tually gets spurned, we will begin with it and then go on to consider why it had to be rejected on the basis of the fundamental philosophical intuitions that motivate the stream-of-thought account. The latter will then be subject to a critical analysis. I. THE SPECIOUS PRESENT That the specious-present doctrine purports to be introspectively based is made manifest in the opening sentence of the chapter when James says, "I shall deal with what is sometimes called internal perception, or the percep tion of time" (570). Such "internal perception" is an instance of the first of James's two ways of studying a psychic phenomenon: "There are, as we know, two ways of studying every psychic state. First, the way of analysis: What does it consist in? What is its inner nature? Of what sort of mind-stuff is it composed? Second, the way of history: What are its conditions of pro duction, and its connection with other facts?" (913). This inner approach seems to be identical with what James earlier calls "introspective observa tion," which is "looking into our own minds and reporting what we there discover" (185). He gives pride of place to introspection over the causally based historical method: "Introspective Observation is what we have to rely on first and foremost and always" (185). It also is made manifest that the motivation behind the account is to sup ply the required experiential credentials for our concepts of temporal suc cession and the past. In general, James's concept empiricism requires that "Every one of our conceptions is of something which our attention origi nally tore out of the continuum of felt experience, and provisionally isolated so as to make of it an individual topic of discourse" (439).2 When James asks, "What is the original of our experience of pastness, from whence we get the meaning of the term?" he is making a specific application of this generalization (570). In order for there to be a relational concept, the relata must "be known in a single pulse of consciousness for which they form one complex 'object'... so that properly speaking there is before the mind at no time a plurality of</page><page sequence="3">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 165 ideas, properly so called" (383). "There is no manifold of coexisting ideas.... Whatever things are thought in relation are thought from the outset in a unity, in a single pulse of subjectivity, a single psychosis, feeling, or state of mind" (268; see also 267 and 573).3 As applied to the case of the relation of temporal succession, this has the consequence that "a succession of feelings, in and of itself, is not a feeling of succession" (591). This parallels a similar claim about our apprehension of spatial relations: "If a number of sensible extents are to be perceived alongside of each other and in defin ite order they must appear as parts in a vaster sensible extent which can enter the mind simply and all at once" (788). The upshot of this is that to have the concept of temporal succession, the conceiver must have had a perception of a succession in which the relata were presented together and as successive. Fortunately, every perception represents such a complex of successive objects: Part of the complexity is the echo of the objects just past, and, in a less degree, perhaps, the foretaste of those just to arrive. Objects fade out of consciousness slowly. If the present thought is of A B C D E F G, the next one will be of B C D E F G H, and the one after that of C D E F G H I?the lingerings of the past dropping successively away and the incomings of the future making up the loss. These lingerings of old objects, these in comings of new, are the germs of memory and expectation, the retrospec tive and the prospective sense of time. (571)4 James follows E. R. Clay in calling the temporal duration presented in each pulse of perceptual experience "the specious present" and contrasts it with the "strict present," which is the mathematically punctual one of the physi cists (573). He even adds, inconsistently as we shall see, that "reflection leads us to the conclusion that it [the strict present] must exist." It would appear that the successive objects, ABC..., within a single specious present are discrete in the sense of being distinct from each other. Not only does this seem to be supported by his distinction between the suc cessive objects ABC... and the action of tracking them across successive specious presents, it plainly is maintained by authors whom James quotes with approval. Wundt's claim concerning pendulum strokes that follow each other at regular intervals in a consciousness otherwise void?"When the first one is over, an image of it remains in the fancy until the second suc ceeds"?is endorsed by James (573), as these remarks made by Hodgson: "If I have consciousness at all, [it] is a sequence of different feelings" (572) and "in a succession of events, say of sense-impressions, A B C D E... the presence of B means the absence of A and of C, but the presentation of this</page><page sequence="4">166 RICHARD M. GALE succession involves the simultaneous presence, in some mode or other, of two or more of the presentations A B C D. In reality, past, present, and future are differences in time, but in presentation all that corresponds to these dif ferences is in consciousness simultaneously" (593). Maybe the strongest reason for taking the successive objects to be dis crete is that if they were not, we could not derive our idea of temporal succes sion from an experience of them; in general, it would seem that we can per ceive a relational complex only if we perceive the relata in it as distinct from each other.5 The later doctrine of Radical Empiricism, which extends the Principles of Psychology's thesis that relations, pace both Hume and Kant, are perceptually given also is committed to the discreteness or separateness of the relata.6 The queerness of the disagreement between James and Hume over the perceptual givenness of relations should make us suspicious that each of them was practicing a Jack Horner phenomenology based on their own respective a priori criteria for what could be phenomenologically or introspectively given. (Think in this connection of "good" Hylas's obviously bogus introspective search for an idea of a triangle in general and his feigned disappointment at his failure to find it. There was no need for such a "search," since it could have been deduced in advance from Berkeley's definition of an "idea" that no such idea would be an object of introspection.) While the text seems to require that the relata are separate from each other, a remark made by James speaks for the liquidification of the successive ob jects. He begins by saying that "the experience is from the outset a synthetic datum, not a simple one," which speaks for the discreteness of the objects or elements within a specious present, but immediately adds that "to sensible perception its elements are inseparable although attention looking back may easily decompose the experience, and distinguish its beginning from its end" (574-75).7 It might be objected that, if they really are inseparable, these elements cannot later be decomposed and distinguished from each other, for the inseparable is that which cannot be decomposed. James might respond that they are ontologically inseparable, but logically or conceptually distin guishable. Even if this surface inconsistency can be neutralized in this way, there remains the following problem: If "time is always of something given as a unit, inside of which attention afterwards discriminates parts in relation to each other," the discriminator must already possess the concept of succes sion; otherwise, how could a discrimination be made between these succes sive parts of the specious present? As a result, the concept of succession, pace James, would not be derived from the perception of a specious present.</page><page sequence="5">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 167 Thus, by liquifying the contents of the specious present into a type of flow ing sludge, James undercuts his attempt to show how our concept of succes sion is derived from the experience of a specious present. Before we delve into why the allure of Bergsonism was so strong, so strong that James could not prevent it from overflowing the chapter "The Stream of Thought" into the one on "The Perception of Time," thereby creating this aporia, more needs to be said about his specious-present doctrine and what might have led him to abandon it. James plainly would not accept my interpretation of his specious present doctrine as an a priori analysis based on its providing the only way in which it is possible for us to have the concept of succession, assuming the truth of concept empiricism, for he supports it by appeal to (1) an introspective analy sis of our experience of time, (2) the neurophysiological causes of sensa tions, and (3) experimental data that determine the duration of a specious present's content. Each of these apparently contingent reasons will be ex plored and found to be misinvoked. (1) Exactly what is supposed to be revealed by an introspective analysis of a perception of a specious present? Are the successive ABC objects of a sensory nature?colors, sounds, and the like? And what about the relation of succession between them; is it sensory or not? The second, but not the first, question receives a clear answer. James is quite explicit that in general we do not have a sensory image or idea of any relation. While he so far agrees with Hume, he goes on to contend, in opposition to Hume's restriction of possible objects of introspection to sensory ideas, that we nevertheless are conscious of them (239 ff.). We are said to have a feeling or thought of them, which are James's most generic terms for consciousness, of which the being aware of a sensory image is only one species (186). These feelings of rela tion are said to be a fringe, halo, wraith, or overtone that attaches to the relata in a relation (260). The first question concerns whether the A B C relata in a relation of suc cession within a specious present are sensorial images. A straightforward reading of the text supports an affirmative answer and thus a sensory model of the specious present. After this model is thoroughly discredited, a more subtle reading of the text will show it to contain the germ of a "perceiving as" model of the specious present that escapes these objections. The major support for the sensory model interpretation comes from the actual language James uses to describe our perception of a specious present. The title of the section in which he presents the doctrine of the specious present is "The Sensible Present Has Duration" (573). The claim that "the</page><page sequence="6">168 RICHARD M. GALE original paragon and prototype of all conceived times is the specious present, the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible" continues this use of sensory terms (594; my emphasis). In his summation at the end of the chapter, he says that the specious present varies "in length from a few seconds to probably not more than a minute, and that this dura tion (with its content perceived as having one part earlier and the other part later) is the original intuition of time" (603; my emphasis). The perceptual nature of the specious present is repeated in the chapter "Memory": "Within the few seconds which constitute the specious present there is an intuitive perception of the successive moments" (619). This dovetails with the claim in the opening sentence of the chapter "The Perception of Time," that our experience of time involves "internal perception" (570). The use of percep tion is not decisive, however, for, as we shall shortly see, the perception could be interpreted as a perceiving-as. More decisive support is found in James's description of a strictly past and a future object within the specious present as respectively an "echo" and a "foretaste," since echoes and tastes are sensory in nature (571). This sen sory unpacking of the content of a specious present dovetails with the analo gies he draws between the perception of space and time. First, there is the claim that there is "a marked difference between elementary sensations of duration and those of space" in that "the former have a much narrower range; the time-sense may be called a myopic organ, in comparison with the eye, for example" (575). Yet another analogy is that "there is ... a sort of per spective projection of past objects upon present consciousness, similar to that of wide landscapes upon a camera-screen" (593). Further proof comes from the fact that the persons whom he quotes with approval plainly have a sensory model: Hodgson, for example, speaks of "the simultaneous percep tion ... of a sequence" (572); Herbart of successive elements being "present with equal clearness together"; and Wundt of an immediately past sound remaining as "an image in the fancy" (573). The sensory model is based on Jack Horner fake phenomenology. Clay's claim, which James also implicitly endorses, that "all the notes of a bar of a song seem to the listener to be contained in the present," is the description of someone who hears a chord, the notes of which vary in loudness according to most sensory models of the specious present, since earlier phases within a single specious present are supposed to have, according to Broad and Ducasse, less vivacity or liveliness than later ones. Mozart is quoted in an earlier chap ter, on behalf of our perceptual present being able to encompass a succes sion of elements of quite some span. In regard to a symphony he composed,</page><page sequence="7">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 169 Mozart wrote, "[I] can see the whole of it at a single glance in my mind, as if it were a beautiful painting or a handsome human being; which way I do not hear it in my imagination at all as a succession?the way it must come later? but all at once, as it were" (247; notice the "as it were" qualification). If Mozart had a thirty-minute auditory specious present that contained the suc cession of sounds within an entire symphony, he must have had some ter rible headaches. Wilfrid Sellars, in the appendix to his Science and Meta physics, neatly brought out the false phenomenology of the sensory model of the specious present by showing that it had the following consequence: when I see your arm rise, I am seeing all of the earlier positions of it when I see it at its topmost position, and thereby I see you as a Hindu God. To be sure, sometimes when we hear a tolling bell we are quite literally hearing past sounds in the form of afterimages; there is a ringing in our ears. But these are exceptional cases, pace the sensory model of the specious present. Clay's claim in support of the sensory model, that "all the changes of place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the present," is beside the point, since in such a case our present perception is not of the past posi tions of the meteor, but of the present trail that it has left (574). Not only is the sensory model at variance with the phenomenological facts; if the content of the specious present really were sensory, it could not be invoked to show how we acquire our concept of temporal succession. If I perceive a rising arm in the Hindu God-like fashion, as is required by the sensory model, then I am perceiving an order of coexistent arms, not a tem poral order of successive events. Similarly, when I hear the final notes of the melody, I am apprehending a succession of notes, not as successive, accord ing to Clay, but as coexistent members in a chord. (One wonders how I would be able to hear the repetitions of a note in a melody.) (2) A possible explanation for James's failure to realize just how out of whack his sensory model of the specious present was with the introspective facts is that he thought certain facts about the neurophysiological causes of sensations required the sensory model. At many, but by no means all, places in the Principles of Psychology James adopts the working hypothesis of physi ological psychology that there is "no psychosis without neurosis" (133). It is assumed that our sensations are caused by these neuroses. Because "the phe nomena of 'summation of stimuli' in the nervous system prove that each stimulus leaves some latent activity behind it which only gradually passes away," it follows that "there is at every moment a cumulation of brain-pro cesses overlapping each other, of which the fainter ones are dying phases of processes which but shortly previous were active in maximal degree" (597</page><page sequence="8">170 RICHARD M. GALE 98). Since these overlapping brain-processes causally condition sensations, it follows that, since "the changes of neurosis are never absolutely discon tinuous, so must the successive psychoses shade gradually into each other" (236). "If recently the brain tract a was vividly excited, and then b, and now vividly c, the total present consciousness is not produced simply by c's ex citement, but also by the dying vibrations of a and b as well" (235). These considerations have the consequence that a sensation has a specious-present content; "all stimuli whose first nerve-vibrations have not yet ceased seem to be conditions of our getting this feeling of the specious present" (609). Further neurophysiological support for the sensory model is found in James's claims that "the echo of the whence, the sense of the starting point of our thought, is probably due to the dying excitement of processes but a moment since vividly aroused" (248; my emphasis), and that just as a note and its overtones "are not separately heard by the ear ... so do the waxing and waning brain-processes at every moment blend with and suffuse and alter the psychic effect of the processes which are at their culminating point" (249). By appeal to the same sort of neurophysiological facts, James in cludes a small portion of the future in the specious present. In many cases we have a "preperception" of a future impression due to our anticipation of a perception in our imagination (415-16), also called "the foretaste of those [objects] just to arrive" (571). But this "foretaste of the terminus must be due to the waxing excitement of tracts or processes which, a moment hence, will be the cereberal correlatives of some thing which a moment hence will be vividly present to the thought" (248). Since we know that our sensations, for the most part, do not have a sen sory specious present, either James's neurophysiological claims are contrary to fact or his assumption that there is a correlation between the waning and waxing of neural processes and sensory states of consciousness is unwar ranted, being an instance of his own "Psychologist Fallacy," in which the psychologist confuses "his own standpoint with that of the mental fact about which he is making his report" (195). Herein it takes the form of an unwar ranted assumption that the features of the publicly observable cause of a conscious state must be something of which the conscious state is aware or which has a correlate in its content. (3) The experimental data to which James appeals in support of his sen sory model of the specious present are of no more avail than were his ap peals to introspection and neurophysiology. Wundt and his student Dietze attempted "to determine experimentally the maximal extent of our immedi ate distinct consciousness for successive impressions" (577). Toward this</page><page sequence="9">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 171 end, they would play for a subject a sequence of rhythmically arranged sounds to determine how much of it could "be remembered as a whole, and identi fied without error when repeated." They found that "the maximum filled duration of which we can be both distinctly and immediately aware" is about twelve seconds (577). James immediately goes on to claim that "these figures may be roughly taken to stand for the most important part of what, with Mr. Clay, we called, a few pages back, the specious present" (578). It should be obvious to the reader that the experimental data radically underdetermine the theoretical construal James places on them. All the data show is the maximum duration of strokes that, as James himself says, can "be remembered as a whole, and identified without error when repeated." This in no way establishes that when the subject is hearing the final stroke of this duration, the earlier strokes that she is immediately conscious of also are auditorily apprehended. A skilled drummer, such as Max Roach, very likely could identify or play back with out error a very intricate rhythmic pattern lasting many minutes while the layman might be good for only several seconds worth, but this hardly shows that Max is having a Mozartian Excedrin Two-type headache when he hears the final sound in virtue of his literally hearing at that time all of the earlier sounds. With this we bid farewell to the doctrine of the sensory specious present, one of the all-time philosophical abortions whose widespread acceptance was due to the mistaken belief that it was soundly supported by a triumvirate of introspection, experimental data, and neurophysiology. While there is ample textual grounds for imputing this benighted doctrine to James, there are other aspects of his text that permit attribution of a nonsensory model to him, in particular a "perceiving-as" version, according to which the immedi ately past and future members of the specious present are not perceived, but inferred. The basis for this attribution is found in James's distinction between a sensation, which is an immediate sensory awareness of a color, odor, or such, and a perception, which is a conceptualized sensation (653). Since perception involves the conceptualization of a given sensation and concepts are rules for inferring things not then given, every perception is a perceiv ing-as?a perceiving of something as being of an instance of a certain con cept. The sensation gives acquaintance with an object, but the perceiving-as relates it to what is not then present. James's notion of perceiving something as having a fringe, halo, wraith, or overtone is the same as perceiving-as, since it is perceiving something as related to something else not then given.</page><page sequence="10">172 RICHARD M. GALE Remember that for James these relations are not sensorily presented, but are felt or thought in his highly generic sense of being something of which we are consciously aware. This perceiving-as account of perception is developed in the chapter "The Stream of Thought." When we hear thunder after silence, we hear the thun der as being preceded by the silence. "Our feeling of the same objective thunder, coming ... [after silence] is quite different from what it would be were the thunder a continuation of previous thunder" (234). Each word of a recited sentence that we understand is heard with a special "overtone, halo, or fringe," meaning that each word is not merely heard, but heard as related to earlier and/or later words of the sentence, which are not themselves then heard (271). This gives the basis for a nonsensory model of the specious present, according to which the span of perceptual awareness is determined by the inferential range of the concept that is applied. Some of James's own formulations of the specious present in the chapter "The Perception of Time" employ the perceiving-as idiom, as, for example, when he says "that we are constantly conscious of a certain duration?the specious present?varying in length from a few seconds to probably not more than a minute, and that this duration (with its content perceived as having one part earlier and other part later) is the original intuition of time" (603; my emphasis). At another place he speaks of the successive elements in a specious present being "thought of together" and quotes with approval Volkmann's claim that suc cessive elements are "represented as occurring in succession" (592). It is not my contention that the perceiving-as model of the specious present works, only that it is not subject to the glaring difficulties of the sensory model. The challenge it faces is to give an adequate account of what it is to have a concept and apply it to a given sensation, but it is not clear that progress cannot be made in this endeavor. The discussion has at least been put back on the tracks; a skein of absurdities and confusions has been replaced by a genuine problem. And that's progress. Why did James give up the doctrine of the specious present after the Prin ciples of Psychology and its Briefer Course? It is understandable why he gave up using the name "the specious present," since, given his later Radical Empiricism identification of reality with the way things appear in experi ence, it has the shoe on the wrong foot. It is not the experiential present that is specious, but rather that of the physicists; and, moreover, as will be seen, he thinks he has Zeno's support for his charge of speciousness against their mathematically punctual present. But why did he give up the doctrine! One would want to believe that it was because he eventually saw all of the above</page><page sequence="11">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 173 difficulties that have been pointed out, but there is no textual support for this. The most likely reason is that he saw that its commitment to discrete succession was unacceptable on metaphysical grounds and that the concept of discrete succession, as a result, was bogus and thus not in need of experi ential legitimation. The concept that does require experiential legitimation is that of promiscuous succession, in which the relata get into each other because they merge, fuse, or melt together. (No doubt, some readers will be distressed to learn that you cannot have a discrete promiscuous affair.) It will now be seen how and why the stream of thought account attempted to legitimate this mushing-together relation. II. THE STREAM OF THOUGHT The opening sentence of the chapter "The Stream of Thought" makes mani fest the introspective basis of the account to follow: "We now begin our study of the mind from within" (219).9 Consciousness is metaphorically lik ened to a flowing river because neither contains distinct, isolatable parts (233): "Every definite image in the mind is steeped and dyed in the free water that flows around it. With it goes the sense of its relations, near and remote, the dying echo of whence it came to us, the dawning sense of whither it is to lead. The significance, the value, of the image is all in this halo or penumbra that surrounds and escorts it?or rather that is fused into one with it and has become bone of its bone and flesh of its flesh" (246). The discrete successive events of the specious present's content have now become mushed together. When we successively hear the words of a sentence, "they melt into each other like dissolving views," thereby showing that in the thought no "parts can be found corresponding to the object's parts. Time-parts are not such parts" (269). Herein James is making a contrast between the discrete successiveness of the objects perceived and the nondiscrete mushing together within the con tent of the perceptual experience: "The things are discrete and discontinu ous; they do pass before us in a train or chain, making often explosive ap pearance and rending each other in twain. But their comings and goings and contrasts no more break the flow of the thought that thinks them than they break the time and the space in which they lie" (233). This stream of thought account is reaffirmed in A Pluralistic Universe and Some Problems of Philosophy\ but with one important difference: a priori arguments are presented for the impossibility of a discrete succession, in fact, for the impossibility of a discrete relation of any kind. In arguing for</page><page sequence="12">174 RICHARD M. GALE this, James winds up a panpsychist. Let us carefully dog his steps along the way to this startling conclusion. The phenomenological analysis of A Pluralistic Universe and Some Prob lems of Philosophy is the same as that of the stream-of-thought account of the Principles of Psychology, differing only in the richness of its newly ac quired Bergsonian descriptions of the mushing-together relation. What our conceptualizing intellect falsely cuts asunder into discretely successive events really "compenetrate" and "telescope" through a sort of "endosmosis" or "conflux" (PU 114). "In the real concrete sensible flux of life experiences compenetrate each other so that it is not easy to know just what is excluded and what not" (113). This agrees with Some Problems of Philosophy's claim that "boundaries are things that intervene; but nothing intervenes save parts of the perceptual flux itself, and these are overflowed by what they separate, so that whatever we distinguish and isolate conceptually is found perceptu ally to telescope and compenetrate and diffuse into its neighbors" (32). It is further claimed that in the mushing relation each relatum becomes its own other, in Hegel's sense: "Every individual morsel of the sensational stream takes up the adjacent morsels by coalescing with them... that no part absolutely excludes another, but that they compenetrate and are cohesive; that if you tear out one, its roots bring out more with them; that whatever is real is telescoped and diffused into other reals; that, in short, every minutest thing is already its Hegelian 'own other,' in the fullest sense of the term" (PU 121; see also 127). James realizes that his mushing-together relation defies the ordinary logic of identity since it gives us an identity that is not really an identity because it is nontransitive: "For conceptual logic, the same is nothing but the same, and all sames with a third thing are the same with each other. Not so in concrete experience" (PU 114-15). Furthermore, James realizes that his counterlogical descriptions of our experience of change "will sound queer and dark" (97). But an "empirical look into the constitution of [reality shows]... that some of them are their own others, and indeed are so in the self-same sense in which the absolute is maintained to be so by Hegel." Spatial neighbors also behave like Playdoh: "What is true here of successive states must also be true of simultaneous characters. They also overlap each other with their being" (PU 130; see also MEN 123). James seems to be saying, if I may paraphrase the punch line to the old shaggy-dog joke, that these immediate neighbors are identical but not THAT identical. This is James's pluralistic mysticism. The commentators, with the exception of Marcus Peter Ford, fail to take seriously the mystical commitments of these passages from A Pluralistic</page><page sequence="13">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 175 Universe, as well as those from Some Problems of Philosophy. Ford, how ever, takes them too seriously and winds up claiming that James's pluralistic mysticism is not a pluralism at all: "Indeed, if two things could be both separate from each other and, at the same time, not separate, in what sense are they actually separate things at all? A philosophy based on the premise that what is true of successive events is also true of contemporary events is finally a form of metaphysical monism" (1982, 54). Herein Ford is claiming that James's mushing-together relation between temporally and spatially adjoined individuals results in a real identity of the transitive sort, rather than of James's nontransitive Hegelian sort. James would object that his brand of pluralistic mysticism, which is of the sort favored by Western theis tic mystics, is a viable alternative to the monistic brand of the East. A common strategy among the commentators who don't want to counte nance James's mysticism, in either the pluralistic form or the monistic form, is to give a Whiteheadian process gloss of his mushing-together relation. Ford, for example, drops James's requirement that spatially adjoined indi viduals are connected together by the symmetric Hegelian mushing-together relation and reinterprets this relation between successive events as a White headian asymmetric relation of "prehension": "At any given moment there is absolute insulation and irreducible pluralism," but earlier actual occasions "are literally in each present actual occasion, though not vice-versa" (1982, 99).This interpretation builds on the earlier interpretations by Victor Lowe and Andrew Reck. According to Lowe, "You actually feel your experience of a moment ago growing into your present experience and compelling some conformation to it" (1941, 114). James's act of appropriation by which the present thought or experience makes a past thought co-personal with it in volves a past occasion "becoming itself present in the experience that is now.... What was outside came inside ... what is inside is felt as having come from outside" (116-17). In the same vein, Reck writes that "James's explanation of how the T as the passing Thought may serve as a principle of unified selfhood within the flux of experience anticipates Whitehead's later doctrine of prehension" (1971, 310).10 The manner in which the self gets unified over time by the asymmetric prehensive relation holds for all chang ing realities. The key question is, exactly in what sense does a past thought or occasion "become present in the experience that is now"? If it is present only in the sense of being an intentional accusative of the thought or occasion that is now, or a cause of it, the account is far too watered down for what James was after in his dark Hegelian sayings. I will have to leave it to Whitehead schol</page><page sequence="14">176 RICHARD M. GALE ars to determine whether the prehension relation is something more mystical than thinking of or being an effect of. Is James's claim that we ordinarily experience change in the mushing together manner phenomenologically vouchsafed? (The importance of this qualification will become clear later.) Plainly not! I no more see the immedi ately adjoined temporal phases of a moving arm's trajectory as mushing together than I see it in the Hindu God-like manner. Maybe James did see them as having "a sort of later suffusion from one thing into another, like a gas, or warmth, or light. The places involved are fixed, but what fills one place radiates and suffuses into the other by lateral movement, 'endosmo sis'" ("The Miller-Bode Objections" in MEN 91-92). If he did, he must hav ing been smoking some funny cigarettes (without inhaling, of course), or the damage to his eyes from his 1865 bout of smallpox was more severe than he let on. Of course, if an arm moves very rapidly, I do see its trajectory in a blurry manner, but this is not so for the vast majority of movements. Fur thermore, I do not see spatial neighbors engaging in "endosmosis" except in the rare cases in which they actually do engage in endosmosis or are abut ting ice cream cones in a hot sun. Maybe I'm too clean-minded, but I do not find that promiscuity runs rampant in my experience. Again, we find James playing Jack Horner and pulling what is philosophically needed out of his phenomenological pie. But why is it needed? It is in answer to this question that the final two books go beyond the Principles of Psychology, which officially eschewed metaphysical speculation, although James couldn't withstand the tempta tion to defend his beloved contra-causal theory of free will. Herein a priori arguments are advanced to show the conceptual impossibility of change be ing a discrete succession or, more generally, there being an immediate rela tion between discrete, that is, numerically distinct, concrete entities. His motto could be "No relations without promiscuity." Since promiscuous relations are the only alternative that we can conceive of to discrete relations, his argument in effect is a transcendental deduction. He masks this when he says in regard to change that, although we have conceptual arguments against discrete succession, "the field is thus open for any other hypothesis; and the one which we shall adopt is simply that which the face of perceptual experi ence suggests" (SPP 85). It is patent, and must have seemed to James that "the face of perceptual experience," at least ordinary perceptual experience, hardly suggests that successive events are promiscuous; thus, his claim re ally is that this is how it must be. It is this or nothing.</page><page sequence="15">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 177 Before James's specific arguments for this motto, such as those based on the various paradoxes of Zeno and Bradley, are considered the underlying assumption that drives these arguments for James must be brought to light. William James, and John Dewey for that matter?along with their absolute idealist opponents?was overly impressed by the fate of poor Humpty Dumpty: once he fell off the wall and disintegrated into separate pieces, all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put him back together again. They had a mystically based "Humpty Dumpty intuition," for they believed that if we ever allow reality to fall apart into numerically distinct substances, there is no way that all the king's philosophers can put them back together again into relational complexes. There are milder and more severe degrees of this intuition. James had a mild form since he believed that a relation could obtain between numerically distinct concrete individuals provided they were connected by a chain of mushing-together relations; others, such as Bradley, denied the possibility of any relation at all obtaining between them. Their Humpty Dumptyism commits them to countenancing only one true substance. James's Humpty Dumpty intuition applies across the board to all con crete relations. James enlists Bradley as an ally in this regard because Brad ley agrees that "immediate feeling possesses a native wholeness which con ceptual treatment analyzes into a many, but can't unite" (SPP 52; my em phasis). Paradoxes of the Zenoian and Bradleyian sort "arise from the vain attempt to reconvert the manifold into which our conception has resolved things, back into the continuum out of which it came" (SPP 51). In "The Miller-Bode Objections" manuscript, which is a most valuable document for helping us to see the gut intuitions that drove James's philosophy, James makes the same point when he succinctly remarks that "you can't confine content" (MEN 84). We fall into these paradoxes because our conceptualiz ing intellect commits us to "no discrimination without separation; no sepa ration without absolute independence' and thereupon impossibility of union" (MEN 113). It might be claimed that Radical Empiricism's perceptual givenness-of-relations thesis renders James's Humpty Dumpty intuition oti ose, since the former shows that there is no problem of explaining the exist ence of relations left over for the latter to try to solve. This claim fails to distinguish between the psychological question concerning how we experi ence relations that is addressed by Radical Empiricism and the ontological question concerning how relations are possible at all that is addressed by Humpty Dumpty intuition.</page><page sequence="16">178 RICHARD M. GALE III. FROM PROMISCUITY TO PANPSYCHISM With the Humpty Dumpty intuition clearly in mind, we can see how James went from promiscuity to panpsychism. The general schema of his argu ment for panpsychism from his Humpty Dumpty intuition is as follows: 1. A relation can immediately obtain between concrete relata only if they are nontransitorily identical with each, that is, if they are iden tical, but not that identical. (Humpty Dumpty intuition) 2. Only in the wondrously mysterious medium of consciousness can there be such a relation of nontransitive identity?an identity that is not an identity, (some kind of truth) 3. Therefore, every concrete individual that is a relatum in a rela tion, which means every concrete thing, has an inner core of con sciousness. It now will be shown how James filled in this argument schema with the specific cases of change and causation. James seems to have been born with an innate fear of Zeno, for as early as the Principles of Psychology (237) he claims that Zeno's paradoxes show the impossibility of change through dis crete succession. In Some Problems of Philosophy and A Pluralistic Universe, James argues that the theory of the continuum in modern mathematics fails to neutralize Zeno's challenge because there cannot be a succession of dis crete states even if their ordering is dense or mathematically continuous. The problem is to explain how there can be a transition from an earlier state to a later one. Given the Humpty Dumpty intuition, there is no way to explain this if the states are discrete. The only way in which change can be under stood is by introspecting what goes on when a conscious being intentionally moves or changes. Thus, James indicts the mathematical physicist's account of change because "it fail[s] to connect us with the inner life of the flux, or with the real causes that govern its direction. Instead of being interpreters of reality, concepts negate the inwardness of reality altogether" (PU 110). The physicist gives us a "knowledge about things, as distinguished from living contemplation or sympathetic acquaintance with them . . . [which] touches only the outer surface of reality" (PU 111). The only way to understand change or flux "is either to experience it directly by being a part of reality one's self, or to evoke it in imagination by sympathetically divining some one else's inner life" (PUW2). Only in this way can we penetrate to "the inner nature of reality" and understand "what really makes it go" (PU 112).</page><page sequence="17">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 179 The demand to understand change from the "inside" by an act of "intui tive sympathy" is based on James's gut intuitions about what constitutes a rationally satisfying account of reality?a case in point of his own "the sen timent of rationality" doctrine according to which philosophers attracted to radically opposed philosophies have different psychological predilections and thus different requirements for what will count as an adequate explana tion. James is an inside man who wants to penetrate to the conscious inner core of everything, motion included. Thus, motion must be explained by introspecting what goes on in our consciousness when we intentionally move. Not surprisingly, it is found that our action-guiding recipe is not, and con ceptually could not be, that of the physicist's description of a traversal of a distance since it fails to specify an initial and final doing and thereby fails to satisfy a conceptual requirement for being a recipe. This is the point that James really is making when he asserts that the runner "perceives nothing, while running, of the mathematician's homogeneous time and space, of the infinitely numerous succession of cuts in both, or of their order" (PU 114). By placing yourself "at the point of view of the thing's interior doing ... all these back-looking and conflicting conceptions lie harmoniously in your hand" (PU 117). The demand to understand change as an intentional action also informs James's discussion of Zeno in Some Problems of Philosophy. He interprets Zeno's dichotomy paradox as demanding that the "number of points to be occupied... be enumerated in succession" (SPP 82; my empha sis). This conversion of a motion into an action clearly underlies James's claim that the "continuous process to be traversed ... is a task?not only for our philosophic imagination, but for any real agent who might try physically to compass the entire performance" (SPP 88). Given James's Humpty Dumpty sentiment of rationality, the only way to explain change is by promiscuous succession. James, however, avoids this transcendental form of argumentation and instead engages in some faked Jack Horner phenomenology. When we introspect our mind, we find that motion is a processual glob, a sort of flowing cotton candy. The only case in which we are experientially acquainted with such a processual change is in our own consciousness. It is not that our awareness of our own conscious ness when we perform an action of moving gives us a paradigm case or even a case that is seminal in the order of concept acquisition. It gives us the only case, every case of motion having to be understood in these agency terms. And this is panpsychism! James's argument is perspicuously rendered as a special case of the pro miscuity-to-panpsychism argument schema.</page><page sequence="18">180 RICHARD M. GALE 4. Change requires promiscuous succession. (Humpty Dumpty in tuition) 5. Promiscuous succession can occur only in consciousness, (some kind of truth) 6. Therefore, all change involves an inner core of consciousness. The Humpty Dumpty intuition that supports premise 4 is itself supported by a transcendental deductive argument. If change is a discrete succession, we're screwed by Zeno. There is change, and the only way it is possible, given the impossibility of discrete succession, is by promiscuous succession. The case of causation is yet another substitution instance of the from promiscuity-to-panpsychism argument schema. Because of the widespread acceptance of Hume's unjustified confinement of the possible objects of in trospection to sensible ideas, it was widely believed that causation cannot be anything more than uniform association. While James agrees that we do not have a sensible idea of causation, or any relation for that matter, he claims that we have a feeling of causation from an introspection of our own mind when we act so as to bring something about. This is the only way in which causation can be understood, just as the only way motion could be under stood is by introspection of what goes on in our consciousness when we intentionally move. Other cases of causation must be understood by project ing what we find to go on in our consciousness when we act onto these external objects. And this is panpsychism: Exactly what do we find through introspection in the cases in which we act? In all these what we feel is that a previous field of 'consciousness,' containing (in the midst of its complexity) the idea of a result, develops gradually into another field in which that result either appears as accom plished, or else is prevented by obstacles against which we still feel our selves to press_It seems to me that in such a continuously developing experiential series our concrete perception of causality is found in opera tion. If the word have any meaning at all it must mean what there we live through. (SPP 106) James asks rhetorically "whether we are not witnessing in our personal ex perience what is really the essential process of creation. Isn't the world re ally growing in these activities of ours? and where we predicate activities elsewhere, have we a right to suppose aught different in kind from this?" (108). Since we take our personal experiences "as the type of what actual</page><page sequence="19">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 181 causation is, we should have to ascribe to cases of causation outside of our own life, to physical cases also, an inwardly experiential nature" (SPP 109). And this is panpsychism! The argument, when explicitly mounted, is an instance of the above argu ment schema: 7. Causation requires a promiscuous relation between cause and ef fect. (Humpty Dumpty intuition) 8. A promiscuous relation between cause and effect can occur only in consciousness, (some kind of truth) 9. Therefore, all causation involves a conscious process. IV. FROM PROMISCUITY TO INEFFABILITY The a priori arguments of Zeno and Bradley for the impossibility of discrete concrete relations also show that reality is ineffable. Before presenting James's best argument for this, I want to set aside two very bad reasons James gave for ineffability. The first is based on the impossibility of any description to capture the full richness and determinateness of reality: "Conceptual knowl edge is forever inadequate to the fulness of the reality to be known" (SPP 45). The second is based on the failure of concepts to be qualitatively iso morphic with their instantiators. One version of this claim is the indictment against conceptual representations for failing to produce what they repre sent. Activity and causation, for example, are said to be incomprehensible because "the conceptual scheme yields nothing like them" (SPP 48). The physicist's space-time diagram of a motion is deficient because it fails to "reproduce it" (SPP 47); it doesn't leap off the blackboard and run around the room. Another version of the lack-of-qualitative-isomorphism objection is that concepts are necessarily discrete (there is no "coming and going" in the Platonic heaven) and the percepts or concrete individuals they represent mush together and thus fail to be qualitatively identical: "The conceptual scheme, consisting as it does of discontinuous terms, can only cover the perceptual flux in spots and incompletely. The one is no full measure of the other, es sential features of the flux escaping whenever we put concepts in its place" (SPP 46).11 Plainly, this ground for the charge of ineffability rests on a self predication howler that would have done Plato proud. It is required that con cepts or words be autological if they are to be adequate representations of</page><page sequence="20">182 RICHARD M. GALE reality. Since concepts of a qualitatively continuous or mushing-together reality are themselves discrete, they fail to meet this requirement. Through this reasoning, it could be shown that the concepts of the morning star and the evening star fail to be co-referential since they are not identical with each other. Furthermore, both of these ineffability claims are trivial because James fails to subject them to his pragmatic requirement that the success of con cepts in representing reality is to be determined by how well they realize the purpose for which they are used. By abstracting from a context of human interests and purposes, James renders vacuous, by his own pragmatic prin ciple, the question of whether descriptions are adequate representations of reality. There is another, far more interesting, argument based on the discreteness of concepts and the Humpty Dumpty-based intuition that concreta are non discrete because they must participate in promiscuous relations with their spatio-temporal neighbors. James begins this argument by granting Hegel's premise that every concrete thing "must in some sort be its own other" and then adding that, "when conceptually...treated, they of course cannot be their own others" (PU 53). No element of our active life can "be treated as a... stable grammatical subject, but that whatever is has the durcheinander char acter, meaning by that that when you say it is anything, it obliges you also to say not only that it is more and other than that thing, but that it is not that thing, both the is and the is not implying at bottom only that our grammati cal forms, condemned as they are to staticality and alternation, are inad equate, if we use them as literal substitutes for the reality" (MEN 123). Promiscuous relations violate the law of identity because each concreta fails to be strictly identical with itself in virtue of being identical, but not THAT identical, with its neighbors: "To act on anything means to get into it somehow; but that would mean to get out of one's self and be one's other, which for intellectualism is self-contradictory" (PU 115).12 The reason that a conceptual system must satisfy the law of identity is that the purpose of a concept is to be discriminatory by partitioning the world up into those indi viduals that are instances of it and those that are not. To account for vague concepts, a third possibility must be added of individuals that neither satisfy nor fail to satisfy the concept. This entails that any instance of a concept cannot enter into promiscuous relations since it would fall on both sides of the partitioning or, in the case of a vague concept, would both be (or fail to be) an instance and also neither satisfy nor fail to satisfy the concept. The reason for this is that the concrete individual that is an instance of concept F</page><page sequence="21">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 183 would also fail to be an instance of concept F because it merges with one of its spatio-temporal neighbors that has a property incompatible with being concept F. But it is just this that is necessarily the case with concrete indi viduals. Therefore, it is conceptually impossible that concepts apply to them and thus they are absolutely ineffable. This argument, when explicitly mounted, looks like this. 10. Necessarily, every concrete individual is promiscuously related to its others. (Humpty Dumpty intuition) 11. Necessarily, concepts can apply only to individuals that are not promiscuously related to their others, (law of identity) 12. Therefore, concepts do not apply to concrete individuals; that is, they are ineffable. "This argument uses conceptually based reasons to show the limitations of concepts. That concepts can neutralize other concepts is one of their great practical functions. This answers also the charge that it is self-contradictory to use concepts to undermine the credit of conception in general. The best way to show that a knife won't cut is to try to cut with it" (SPP 60). If we are to penetrate to the inner essence of reality, we must learn "to think in non conceptualized terms" (PU 131). James's task, like that of the traditional mystic, is to "deafen [us] to talk" (PU 131), and he accomplishes this, not by following the traditional mystical way of meditation and asceticism, but rather by contemplating the koans supplied by the arguments of Zeno and Bradley and other absolute idealists to show the contradictory nature of our ordinary conceptual scheme.13 What will we experience when we have succeeded in ridding ourselves of all concepts? It can't be a perceiving-as type of experience, since this involves the application of concepts to sensations. According to the intro spective analyses of James and Bergson, it will be of the mushing together of things. In "A Suggestion about Mysticism," James gives this very stream of-thought account of our perception of time: "The present field as a whole came continuously out of its predecessor and will melt into its successor as continuously again" (EP 158). The sort of mushing-together relations of which we become aware when we experience in the pure, nonconceptualized man ner become vastly expanded in mystical experiences. Herein, the threshold of ordinary sensory awareness is lowered and there is a "very sudden and incomprehensible enlargement of the conscious field" (159). We become conscious of a unification of reality in which "the sense of relation will be</page><page sequence="22">184 RICHARD M. GALE greatly enhanced" (159). It is not just that our ordinary field of conscious ness is vastly expanded, for there is nothing especially mystical about a wide angle lens, but rather that we experience a richer complex of things mushing together. The experience is not just a unifying experience, but an experience of unification, of the melting together of things. However, the fusing and merging together never realizes that of complete union and that is why the identity of a thing with its "other" is not transitive. Accordingly, James calls himself a "pluralistic mystic" and thereby aligns himself with the traditional theistic mystics who claimed to experience their becoming identical with God, but not THAT identical. Is this account of our conceptless experience of change based on Jack Horner phenomenology? I don't know. I'll have to leave it to those who have realized this special state of consciousness?the mystics and the acid heads?to decide. But one thing is certain. It is not an account "of the adult consciousness itself," as it purports to be at the outset of "The Stream of Consciousness" in the Briefer Course (139). If it is an account of anything, it is of a highly unusual form of consciousness, such as might be had if we had learned the trick of ridding ourselves of all concepts. V. THE BIG APORIA My exposition of James has so far conveniently overlooked his oft-repeated claim that our experience of change is pulsational, and must be if we are to escape the clutches of Zeno. This creates a big aporia since there is a seem ing contradiction between the pulsational and the stream-of-thought accounts of our experience of change. An effort will be made to neutralize this aporia, but at best it will be only partially successful since it will require that some of James's text be ignored or dropped. Fortunately, what will have to be ignored ought to be ignored. That our experience of time's flow is pulsational is maintained in the Principles of Psychology: "We tell it off in pulses. We say 'now! now! now!' or we count 'more! more! more!' as we feel it bud. This composition out of units of duration is called the law of time's discrete flow" (585; see PU 129 and SPP 88 for more of the same). That "time itself comes in drops" (PU 104) is not only phenomenologi cally vouchsafed, but also supported by neurophysiological facts concern ing the thresholds for perceptual awareness (PU 104). Furthermore, only if change is pulsational can we escape the clutches of Zeno: "Either we must stomach logical contradiction, therefore, or we must admit that the limit is</page><page sequence="23">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 185 reached in these successive cases by finite and perceptible units of approach? drops, buds, steps, or whatever we please to term them, of change, coming wholly when they do come, or coming not at all" (SPP 93-94). We should be suspicious of any phenomenological support for a claim that also is supported by a priori arguments, for the phenomenology invari ably turns out to be of the Jack Horner variety. Our expectations are not disappointed in this case. James's phenomenologically based claim that, "sen sibly, motion comes in drops, waves or pulses" (PU 107) flies in the face of ordinary experience. I do not see the rising arm as a discrete succession of droplet-type things, as I might if I were watching a motion picture of it on an out-of-whack projector. Pace James, we need not, and usually do not, expe rience a bottle emptying drop by drop (PU 103^4). It is not uncommon to see a bottle of Chivas Regal decanting in this manner, but not when it is a bottle of Bankers Club vodka. It just pours out! While James is right that our experience is pulsational when we count or reiterate the word Now, it is hardly typical of our ordinary way of experiencing change. How is the aporia to be resolved? One obvious way, which even has some textual support, is to make the act-object distinction and hold the former alone to be pulsational. Immediately after formulating the "law of time's discrete flow" James adds that "the discreteness is, however, merely due to the fact that our successive acts of recognition or apperception of what it is are discrete. The sensation is as continuous as any sensation can be" (PP 585). This act-content distinction seems to inform his claims that whereas "things are discrete and discontinuous... their comings and goings and con trasts no more break the flow of the thought that thinks them than they break the time and space in which they lie" (PU 233) and there cannot be found "in the thought any parts ... corresponding to the object's parts. Time parts are not such parts" (PU 269). If James means to be making this act-content distinction, we must understand his ambiguous claim that our "acquaintance with reality grows literally by buds or drops of perception" (SPP 80) as applying only to the perceptual acts, not their phenomenological contents. Via this distinction, we can escape having to countenance James's Jack Horner pulsational phenomenological account. Unfortunately, the act-content distinction does not succeed in completely dissolving the aporia. We are still left with a discrete succession of acts of perception?and this clashes with James's Humpty Dumpty intuition that discrete individuals cannot be related. We are left with a choice. We can agree with James that only a discrete succession can avoid Zeno's paradoxes and give up the Humpty Dumpty intuition or we can hold onto this intuition</page><page sequence="24">186 RICHARD M. GALE and reject James's demand that change is to be understood in terms of hu man agency. Given how central the Humpty Dumpty intuition is to James's overall philosophy, we would do better to withdraw his anthropomorphic demand. We would still be required to understand a change in terms of the mushing-together relation, but it would not be necessary to understand it in terms of an agent's action-guiding recipe for producing that change. The latter concerns our stance as practical beings who want to bring about changes in the world, in contrast with the passive and conceptless stance of the Humpty Dumpty observer whose aim is to penetrate to the conscious inner core or essence of reality.14 University of Pittsburgh NOTES 1. I know of two places in his post-1892 unpublished writings where he used "specious present." In his notes for Philosophy 9, taught during 1905-6, he wrote in a margin, "Give concrete examples of the discontinuity: Positive differences next each other, and nothing between. This means, in case of time, specious presents coming by drops; and in case of motion positions given discretely in specious presents just as they empirically are" (ML 373). In 1908 he wrote in his unpublished "Miller-Bode Objections" manuscript that "the relation of succession is a good one to begin illustrating by, for in the specious present the 'was' and the 'about-to-be' commingle. The logically distinct are not the ontologically separate"(M?7V 120). Although he retains the term here, the description he gives plainly involves a rejection of the discreteness of the Principles of Psychology account of the specious present in favor of the Bergsonian stream-of-thought one. All emphases are James's unless otherwise noted. 2. In Some Problems of Philosophy James claims that all subject matters, even logical and mathematical ones, are "abstracted and generalized from long-forgotten perceptual in stances from which they have as it were flowered out" (34) and "to understand a concept you must know what it means. It means always some this, or some abstract portion of a this, with which we first made acquaintance in the perceptual world, or else some grouping of such abstract portions" (46). 3. A similar claim is made in A Pluralistic Universe: "If we do not feel both past and present in one field of feeling, we feel them not at all" (128). 4. There appears to be a vicious infinite regress lurking in this account of how we ac quire our retrospective sense and our prospective sense. It is required that we be aware of certain contents as lingering from one specious present to an immediately successive spe cious present. But, according to James's concept empiricism, this requires that we relate these specious presents together, and this can be done only if they are co-present to a single perception. Thus, there must be a second-order perception of these specious presents as suc cessive, but since these successive specious presents are given together to this second-order perception, there is no experience of a lingering of contents from the earlier to the later one. This creates the need to bring in yet a third-order perception of a succession of second-order perceptions, and so on ad infinitum. This regress is vicious because at each stage in it we are left with the same problem that we originally set out to solve, namely, to account for the perceptual basis of our sense of lingering.</page><page sequence="25">FROM THE SPECIOUS TO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESENT 187 5. Seigfried's exposition of James's account of how we perceive relations clearly runs aground over this point: "We do not see something bright and then in a second act of seeing perceive something dull and then in an act of reflection conclude that the bright thing is next to the dull thing. Rather we see 'brightthingnexttodullthing' in one glance and only later discriminate out the elements" (1978, 12-13). Herein we are not seeing a relational complex because we do not see the relata as distinct. Rather, we are seeing some kind of cotton candyish glop. What happens, we are told, is that subsequent to the experience the subject carves out of the originally presented glop separate objects. Only then can she be aware of a relation between them. Thus, the relation between these objects is not directly and immedi ately given in perception, pace what James says over and over again in the Principles of Psychology and in his later Radical Empiricism writings. The concept of the relation, there fore, seems to be a priori because the subject brings it to bear on, rather than deriving it from, the perceptually given. 6. The doctrine of pure experience or neutral monism, which supposedly is discovered by following the empirical postulate of Radical Empiricism, also is committed to each basic unit or pulse of experience comprising numerically distinct and separate components. Skrupskelis (1995, 87) rightly points out that the same bit of pure experience, say a chair, can enter into the mental states of two different mental streams, "but since each of the mental states is a field of which the chair is only one moment, the two persons can see the same chair only if the same bit of experience is present in two different mental fields." 7. Another way in which James seems to Bergsonize the specious present is through his claim that "the specious present has ... a vaguely vanishing backward and forward fringe" (578). This seems to be of a piece with his endorsement of Hodgson's remark that the rear ward and forward limits of the specious present are "ready to melt into other minima, pro ceeding from other stimuli" (572). 8. In fact, he seems to say just this in the 1908 remark quoted in footnote 1, that "the logically distinct [elements within a specious present] are not ontologically separate." 9. A similar remark occurs at the beginning of the abridged version of this chapter in the Briefer Course: "We are now prepared to begin the introspective study of the adult con sciousness itself (139). The use of consciousness in place of the Principle of Psychology's thought runs throughout the Briefer Course and is a concession James made to the criticism of psychologist George Turnbull Ladd that the Principles of Psychology short shrifted con sciousness. 10. For other Whiteheadian process interpretations of James's flow of thought, see Eisendrath (1971) and Fontinell (1986, esp. 93 and 148). 11. This argument is presented enthymemically in the Principles of Psychology. Concepts "form an essentially discontinuous system, and translate the process of our perceptual expe rience, which is naturally a flux, into a set of stagnant and petrified terms. The very concep tion of flux itself is an absolutely changeless meaning in the mind: it signifies just that one thing, flux, immovably" (442). 12. The reader must be alerted that the "intellectualism" that James opposes keeps chang ing before her eyes. Sometimes it is adherence to a logic that obeys the laws of standard logic, such as that of identity and noncontradiction (PU 98,46, 53, 67,94). "Intellectualistic logic," sometimes called "conceptual logic" (PU 109), requires that identity be transitive (PU 98 and 115). At other times, intellectualism is the strawman doctrine that a name ex cludes "from the fact named what the name's definition fails positively to include," which James calls "vicious intellectualism" (PU 32; see also 53 and 99 and MT 149). Yet another version of it is that reality can be adequately captured through concepts (PU 98 and 130-31).</page><page sequence="26">188 RICHARD M. GALE At one place it is nothing but platonic essentialism (PU 99 and SPP 48). Intellectualism also is said to be the view that "what can be distinguished ... is separate; and what is separate is unrelated" {PU 134). To complete this confusing plethora of senses of "intellectualism" is the identification of it with "the belief that our mind comes upon a world complete in itself, and has the duty of ascertaining its contents; but has no power of re-determining its character, for that is already given" (PU 111). One can reject the spectator theory of knowledge (or essentialism) and still adhere to the laws of logic. The relevant sense of intellectualism for my purpose is the first one, involving acceptance of the traditional laws of logic. 13. Numerous commentators have failed to realize that James's claim of ineffability is rooted in his mystical Humpty Dumpty intuition, which is just one way in which they ignore or downplay the centrality of mysticism in James's metaphysics. Bernstein, for example, in his introduction to A Pluralistic Universe, interprets James as saying that "concrete reality and experience are richer, more dynamic, and thicker than can possibly be expressed by our concepts" (1977, xiv). From this watered-down distortion of why reality is ineffable for James, he concludes that "James is not playing off rationality against a nonrational or irrational intuition of the way things are; rather, he is urging a more realistic, concrete, and humane sense of human rationality" (xv). The above quotations from A Pluralistic Universe make it clear that James is doing just what Bernstein denies he is doing. In a similarly distorted vein, Fontinell writes that "James's concern for the concrete and his recognition that 'life exceeds logic' should not be interpreted as a mode of irrationalism or antiintellectualism except inso far as rationalism and intellectualism are understood as confusing concepts or ideas with the full richness of experience and reality" (1986, 62). Yet another example is Hare's introduc tion to Some Problems of Philosophy: "James did not wish to discredit all conceptual think ing but only to encourage the development of more flexible thinking" (1979, xl). He warns us that "the romantic side of SPP should be kept in perspective and not allowed to obscure the fundamental features of the metaphysics James outlined so lucidly and persuasively" (xli). Pace Hare, the metaphysics of Some Problems of Philosophy, as well as that of A Pluralistic Universe, is based on an appeal to his romantic Bergsonian conceptless intuition. Plainly, all three commentators ignore the mystical basis of James's ineffability claim in his Humpty Dumpty intuition. 14.
