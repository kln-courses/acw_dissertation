<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 13 Monju-kun Children’s Culture as Protest Noriko Manabe Hello! I’m Monju-kun. I’ve just started tweeting. Public interest in my exis- tence has been fading because of the accident at Fukushima Daiichi, but I  don’t want people to forget about me. Up to now, I haven’t generated a single  watt of electricity, yet I’ve used up 900 billion yen. Some people are inconsid- erate enough to say that I’m a waste of money, but isn’t it all for the develop- ment of science? As my dad, JAEA [Japan Atomic Energy Agency], says, “As  we attend to our research, we’ll hold dear in our hearts that we are using the  invaluable taxes taken from everyone in this country.” (@monjukun, Twitter,  May 4, 2011) With this self-introduction, Monju-kun—a cartoon character modeled on the  Monju fast-breeder reactor (FBR) in Fukui prefecture—made his debut on Twit- ter. He garnered over one hundred thousand followers and published four books,  regular newspaper columns, and interviews with key antinuclear figures while  posing as a problematic nuclear reactor, personified as a cherubic but sickly boy.  Through this character, Monju-kun’s creator (hereafter “M.C.”) informed citizens  about nuclear power, news sources, and antinuclear events, as well as encouraged  them to raise their voices in demonstrations. Monju-kun resembles characters in manga (comics) and anime (animation)  for children, with a fully developed personality and life story that recall those of  Tetsuwan Atomu (Iron-Strength Atom, known in the United States as Astro Boy)  and Nobita of Doraemon, characters from two of Japan’s best-loved anime. But  both Atomu (derived from “atom”) and Doraemon (the cat-robot from the future)  are powered by internal nuclear reactors; they were part of the media-intensive  process of naturalizing nuclear power into a part of everyday Japanese life (Kine- fuchi 2015: 452). Much of this pronuclear media was directed at children and their  mothers, often through the deployment of cute characters like Denko-chan, Tokyo  264 </page> <page sequence="2"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    265 Electric Power (TEPCO)’s mascot, and Pluto-kun, JAEA’s stand-in for plutonium.  By harnessing character culture, Monju-kun’s creator played on the same methods  used by pro-industry bodies to present an alternative take on the nuclear industry,  nuclear accidents, and radiation, so that mothers and children could learn about  the issues in a friendly, approachable, nontechnical way. This chapter explores the  ways in which Monju-kun plays on the tropes of Japanese characters and chil- dren’s culture, and how these tropes are harnessed in propaganda and oppositional  movements alike, much in the same way that children once humanized soldiers  (see chapter 9). WHY MONJU-KUN? On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami led to an electric- ity blackout, precipitating the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. The cores of  three nuclear reactors melted down, setting off hydrogen explosions, and the roof  of a fourth reactor blew off, exposing spent fuel. As Japanese residents watched  the explosions on television, the lack of information caused many to panic over  the safety of air, water, food, and land. Government officials—relying on TEPCO,  the operator of the troubled plant, for information—played down concerns about  radiation, only to report higher numbers months later. As M.C. recounted in  anger, “The officials would say it wasn’t dangerous, but later on, they’d say, ‘Well,  actually, a meltdown did occur. Actually, all this cesium and iodine got into the tap  water.’ It was useless to find out after the fact” (M.C., interview with the author,  Tsuruga, October 15, 2013).1 But even under such frustrating circumstances, most Japanese could not show  their anger, fear, or any emotion other than sympathy for the victims of the disas- ter, which became known as 3/11; an atmosphere of self-restraint (jishuku) had  fallen on the country. The nuclear accident became a particularly sensitive topic.  Mothers were particularly worried about the impact of radiation on young chil- dren’s health, but they could not say anything about it. “Radiation became a taboo  topic that no one could mention, even among mothers’ groups. Everyone, includ- ing the press, was censoring him or herself. Physicians held a range of opinions on  radiation and health, but the press would quote only those who said, ‘It’s all fine,’  while ignoring the ones who said it was dangerous, ‘in order not to worry people.’  It made me sad that people couldn’t say what they truly thought, or even that they  were scared. The accident was having a highly negative psychological impact as  well as a physical one” (M.C. interview). M.C. also recognized that the media, particularly television, was reinforcing  this spiral of silence (see Noelle-Neumann 1993) by repeating pronuclear positions  such as, “There’s not enough electricity,” so constantly on television and in newspa- pers that these positions became de facto “truths.”2 Information was actually being  reported, but the most crucial information was being treated like a minor detail:  </page> <page sequence="3"> 266    Contemporary Japan “It didn’t stand out and would go by in an instant. There was a lot of informa- tion you’d miss if you weren’t reading the newspapers very, very carefully” (M.C.  interview). M.C. decided to act as a sort of translator, making the news easy to  understand. In doing so, M.C. served a function akin to independent journalism  sources like Iwakami Yasumi’s IWJ Internet news network, alternative informa- tion blogs like Fukushima Diary, and blogs and newspapers by popular musicians  like Gotō Masafumi of rock band Asian Kung-Fu Generation; such independent  content was instrumental in educating the population about radiation, the collu- sion among the nuclear industry and government officials, and alternative energy  solutions. But M.C. had a different orientation: “I’m taking information that looks  very difficult to understand and putting it into childlike language, simple enough  for even a child to understand, so that more people would want to read it” (M.C.  interview; emphasis mine). In other words, M.C. purposefully targeted Monju-kun toward mothers and  their small children. Historically, Japanese children’s culture has had propagandis- tic elements, allowing the country’s leadership to mold its citizens from an early  age. For example, school songbooks up to 1945 included many songs that encour- aged a pro-military stance—encouraging children to play war games, glorifying  self-sacrifice for the emperor, and promoting adulation of the war dead—for the  purpose of grooming boys to be prepared for war (Manabe 2012; see also c hapters  8 and 9). Furthermore, children’s culture is embraced and absorbed into adult  culture, partly because it is part of adults’ activities with children. Parents and  grandparents read children’s stories to them, watch children’s movies and televi- sion programs with them, and sing children’s songs with them. As such, much of  children’s culture is formulated to stimulate adults as well as children—a point  which is true for dōyō, a type of children’s song, many of which are composed for  adults to sing to children. Such songs are popular among adults, featuring in con- cert halls and recordings. Furthermore, children and their mothers had been among the biggest targets  of pronuclear propaganda and needed to hear the counterarguments. During the  drive to domesticate nuclear power as safe, modern, and necessary for economic  growth, Japanese children’s culture became filled with stories that made nuclear  power seem natural or even heroic. Nuclear reactors were internalized into the  bodies of Astro Boy and Doraemon; they powered the cyclones of Kamen Rider  and the mobile suits of Gundam. Godzilla, which had debuted in 1954 as a feared  by-product of nuclear testing, had by the mid-1960s become a kiddie hero, pro- tecting mankind using atomic powers. Nuclear power plants often built public  relations facilities in their host towns, to which schoolchildren would be taken.  Children’s characters often adorned these facilities: a stuffed replica of Studio  Ghibli’s Totoro once welcomed children to the PR facility near the Fukushima  Daini plant.3 Rock star Gotō Masafumi, who visited the nearby Hamaoka PR  facility as a child, said that he grew up thinking it was completely normal to live  </page> <page sequence="4"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    267 near this plant, which lies near the intersection of tectonic plates. Poster contests  sponsored through schools or government ministries encouraged children to  reiterate the mantra that nuclear power was safe, modern, and clean. The now  infamous sign on the entry to Futaba, the host town for the Fukushima Daiichi  plant—“Bright energy of the future”—was the result of one such contest; the win- ner was a sixth-grade boy. Pictured often after Futaba was evacuated, it became an  index of pronuclear propaganda. Mothers, too, not only absorbed this position- ing through children’s culture, but were also specifically targeted in pronuclear  television advertisements, which emphasized the environmental friendliness and  necessity of nuclear power. They often pictured children, linking nuclear power  with protecting them. Monju-kun was a counterpunch to these pronuclear argu- ments directed at children and mothers. Second, mothers were concerned about radiation, which has the most serious  effects on babies and young children. Sources of contamination could be any- where—school lunches, drinking water, milk, playgrounds, puddles on the way  home, et cetera. However, mothers were ill equipped to inform themselves. As  M.C. told this author, “Mothers with young children are extremely busy, taking  care of children all day. They don’t have the time to look for information on a PC.  Their only tool might be their mobile phones, and they can only gather fragments  of information. Their Internet literacy may be low, and they may have difficulty  reading through a long essay. For them, a Twitter message of 140 characters and  a link to further information is just right. I thought it would be useful to them if  I could hand them the information one [data] packet at a time” (M.C. interview). M.C. also decided to speak in the guise of a cartoon-like character. First, M.C.  wished to retain anonymity, likely to avoid the backlash that is commonly directed  at antinuclear activists, who are humiliated publicly, lose professional opportuni- ties, and receive physical threats.4 In addition, M.C. may have wished to avoid dis- agreements: M.C.’s own family did not know about Monju-kun. Indeed, Japanese  are far more likely to use the Internet anonymously than Americans (Morio and  Buchholz 2009), which accounts for the more rapid acceptance in Japan of Twit- ter, which allows multiple accounts, over Facebook, which prefers users to register  under their own names. In 2010, only 22.5 percent of Japanese Twitter users held  an account under their real names; 70 percent held a pseudonymous account, and  8.5 percent had multiple accounts (Kin 2010: 75). Another survey in 2011 showed  that in Japan only 7 percent of Twitter users and 21 percent of social network users  (mixi, Facebook) held accounts in their real names (Orita 2014). Through ano- nymity, more Japanese are able to hold frank discussions that are rare in day-to- day life; some users speak more openly on Twitter than with friends (Kin 2010: 43).  Anonymity on Twitter helped not only M.C. to speak out, but also Monju-kun’s  followers to speak. The guise of a character was also beneficial. As M.C. explained to me: “People  are familiar with characters and have friendly feelings toward them. They would  </page> <page sequence="5"> 268    Contemporary Japan prefer to listen to a neutral, cute character chatting away [than to a person] . . . . If  the person behind it becomes known, many people will want to attack him. The  more conspicuous a person becomes, the more people he will infuriate. On the  other hand, it’s hard to get angry at this soft, fluffy thing. After all, people really  love cute things” (M.C. interview). THE LOVE OF CHARACTERS That many Japanese would prefer to learn from a fictional character than a per- son is hardly strange in a country where children regularly learn about history,  politics, Buddhism, and other complex issues through manga. Indeed, cartoons  and characters are ubiquitous in contemporary Japanese culture and have a long  history. During the Asia-Pacific War, the protagonist of the Momotarō (Peach  Boy) fable was made into a character symbolizing the quintessential brave Japa- nese male. In the 1960s, Tezuka Osamu’s Astro Boy enjoyed television ratings as  high as 40 percent (Aihara 2007: 14). Hello Kitty—perhaps Japan’s most famous  character—underwent a big boom in the 1990s, when adult women began buying  more character goods (Aihara 2007: 43; Yano 2013). According to a survey by toy  maker Bandai’s Character Research Institute in 2004, character goods (e.g., stuffed  toys, pencils, or other items with an imprint of the character) were popular among  not only children but also adults, with 90 percent of women and 60 percent of  men in their forties owning them (Aihara 2007: 19–21). The Bandai survey found  that adults owned character goods to help them relax from the stresses of the day.  Characters were substitute mothers that comforted and protected their owners by  their sheer presence, allowing some to regress to a childlike state (Aihara 2007,  27–28, 39–41; Yano 2013). This affection for characters has led corporations to use them to foster intimacy  between their goods and consumers (Allison 2006: 14). For example, Peko-chan,  a pigtailed girl licking her lips, has been the character mascot of candy retailer  Fujiya since the 1950s (Aihara 2007: 14). Local governments and organizations also  employ yuru kyara—“loose” or “wobbly” characters—as mascots to create a favor- able image of towns, local products, or events (Occhi 2012). These characters have  personalities and stories that explain how they are related to what they represent.  In addition to cartoon logos or animated characters, these characters have a live  version (a person in a fluffy costume) that walks around events and greets people,  who pose for pictures with them. The nuclear industry has also had its share of characters. TEPCO, the company  in charge of the troubled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, had a cartoon  spokeswoman in Denko-chan (Electric Girl). Pictured as a ponytailed house- wife, she appeared in pamphlets, websites, and a series of television commercials  encouraging efficient use of electricity and promoting nuclear power. In one 2004  commercial, Denko is shopping at a supermarket and remarks that everything is  </page> <page sequence="6"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    269 imported. Suddenly a professor appears, telling her that energy is also imported.  He says that electric power companies are importing the source that generates the  most energy out of the least amount of raw materials—uranium. He argues that  nuclear power raises Japan’s self-sufficiency in energy.5 Denko-chan was decom- missioned in March 2012, following the Fukushima Daiichi accident. Pluto-kun was a mascot character of JAEA, representing plutonium—the  radioactive element used in the bomb dropped on Nagasaki and as part of fuel in  the Monju fast-breeder nuclear reactor (FBR). He appears in Atom Plaza, JAEA’s  public-relations building in Tsuruga, Fukui prefecture, where the Monju FBR is  located; he also appears on its website. The character looks like a cute little boy  from outer space, with a round, smiling face and a helmet with the letters “Pu,” the  chemical symbol for plutonium. In an eleven-minute video made in 1993, Pluto- kun speaks in a cute, high-pitched, innocent little boy’s voice, attempting to dispel  all the “negative rumors” about him.6 In a hurt tone, he says, “Some people exag- gerate and talk about me as if I were something really terrible  .  .  . They say I’m  highly poisonous and can be the cause of cancer, but they misunderstand.” To  cheery, soothing music, he enthuses, “No one has ever gotten cancer from plu- tonium! If you drink plutonium, your body will just get rid of it.” This video was  shown in the public-relations facilities of several nuclear power plants. After 3/11,  it stopped being used. The industry’s use of characters for promoting nuclear power inspired M.C. to  come up with another take on corporate characters and wobbly mascots: “If you  can use characters to say that a dangerous thing isn’t dangerous, then why not have  a counterpart say that a dangerous thing is actually dangerous? After all, to say that  nuclear power is safe is a lie. If you need a cute character to cover up a lie, you can  conversely use one to undo the lie and dissolve it” (M.C. interview). M.C. also decided to use the Monju FBR as the basis for the character, “because  it’s dangerous, and it’s not that well known, despite its great significance and haz- ardousness. It hadn’t attracted that much interest or protests against it . . . It’s the  devil-child [oni-go] of Japan’s nuclear policy” (M.C. interview). Monju was a key  node in the nuclear fuel cycle, in which the spent fuel of ordinary nuclear reactors  was to be reprocessed into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel at the Rokkashō Nuclear Fuel  Reprocessing Facility in Aomori prefecture, and MOX was used as fuel for the  Monju FBR. However, both Rokkashō and Monju had had several accidents, and  as of 2017, neither seemed close to being commercially viable. As M.C. said: The plan is to have ordinary nuclear power plants, Monju, and Rokkasho, operate the  nuclear cycle among them. If they admit two of those nodes don’t work, then you re- ally wouldn’t be able to use nuclear power anymore, because there won’t be any place  to take the spent fuel. But they won’t admit it, and keep saying that it will succeed one  day. They started planning it in the 1960s, and fifty years later in the 2010s, it’s still  not done. They’re now saying it will be completed in 2050. It’s a dream that’s taking  ninety years to fulfill. How much can you trust that? It’s like a comedy. And it wasn’t  </page> <page sequence="7"> 270    Contemporary Japan known about at all. It’s emblematic of Japanese nuclear policy, and it’s very critical.  For that reason, I featured Monju. (M.C. interview) Monju-kun constantly reminded followers that Monju, the plant, cost Japanese  taxpayers 20 billion yen ($180 million) every year. Despite its many problems,  including an order from the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) in 2013 to  remain shut due to lax safety inspections, it remained an ongoing entity, sup- ported by taxes, until September 2016. While Monju-kun often referred to his  friend Fukuichi-kun—the troubled Fukushima Daiichi plant—M.C. believed it  would be in poor taste to feature Fukuichi-kun as the primary character, given that  160,000 people had had to evacuate from their homes as a result of the nuclear  accident (M.C. interview). While M.C. said that much of the character’s genesis and development was  spontaneous and driven by emotional response, the character of Monju-kun  shares many of the features of well-formed Japanese characters. As Itō (2007),  Aihara (2007), Condry (2009), Yano (2013), and others have pointed out, creators  of anime, manga, and character goods take great care in developing the person- alities, premises, and world-settings for their characters, whose formation often  precedes and receives more emphasis than plotlines. Let us now examine how  Monju-kun, the character, was constructed in terms of appearance, personality,  and premise. Monju-kun appears as a very young boy, with a round face and rotund  figure.  That he is a boy rather than a girl fits partly into character convention—most  nuclear-powered characters, such as Astro Boy, are boys, as they are meant to be  strong. Indeed, nuclear power is often depicted in masculine terms, as a represen- tation of Japan’s technological and economic might. Perceiving this depiction as a  hangover of Nakasone’s desire to possess the technology behind the atom bomb,  the rapper ECD declares in “Straight Outta 138” (Dengaryū 2012) that nuclear  power is the “penis substitute of those old men who wanted to keep fighting the  war” but were prohibited from having nuclear weapons. Hence, Monju-kun’s gender is deeply ironic. He is anything but an Astro Boy-like  hero. He is a little boy who is physically fragile—“Even though I haven’t worked,  I’m falling apart, and my body hurts everywhere” (Monju-kun 2012b: 12)—an apt  personification of the actual reactor, which had proved prone to accidents. The  Monju FBR’s vulnerability to sodium leakage is translated into the kid-friendly  metaphor of a boy susceptible to diarrhea (“If there’s a big earthquake, would I be  able to hold it in?” Monju-kun 2012b: 68). This depiction of Monju-kun as a help- less boy, in need of continuous minding, emasculates the Monju FBR, and with it,  Japan’s nuclear power program, as incapable and powerless. Monju-kun’s youth  and rotund figure also symbolize that the reactor has hardly worked; in contrast,  Fukuichi-kun (Fukushima Daiichi) is an ojii-chan (grandpa) because before its  collapse the plant was old, having operated for over forty years. </page> <page sequence="8"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    271 The appearance of characters often has symbolic meaning. To formulate Monju- kun’s, M.C. took aspects of Monju the FBR, as well as of Monju, the Mañjuśrī  bodhisattva of wisdom after whom the nuclear reactor is named. Like Mañjuśrī,  Monju-kun has a bindi on his forehead, elongated ears, and a headband bordering  a crown, with a flower in its center (see figure 16).7 In place of Mañjuśrī’s crown,  Monju-kun sports a dome resembling a nuclear reactor with a pointed top that  looks like the exhaust tower of the Monju FBR. To make him child-friendly, M.C.  limited colors to four basic ones that toddlers could name—baby blue, pink, skin  color, and yellow. On book covers and in the stuffed costume, much surface area  is colored in yellow to make the objects brighter (M.C. interview). This coloring  helps the books and characters to stand out in public and attract attention. Monju- kun’s costume sports a band-aid on his bottom “to prevent sodium from leaking.” Many characters come with an origin story that explains who the character is  and how he or she has become this way. For Monju-kun, the most dramatic version  of his origin story is given in his “autobiography,” Goodbye Monju-kun (Sayōnara,  Monju-kun; Monju-kun 2012b). The first chapter is a recounting of the December  8, 1995 accident at the Monju plant and subsequent cover-up, where actual events  are told from the anthropomorphic perspective of the reactor himself: I still remember that accident clearly . . . It was past 7 pm, and the oji-san (“uncles,”  men) were raising the output of the reactor  .  .  . I started to feel a little sick. My  stomach started to twitch. Hmm, what is this awful feeling? Then something burst  open. I suddenly felt pangs of pain at the bottom of my stomach, as if I were being  squeezed  .  .  . Suddenly, I saw a hole in the sodium pipe, and sodium was flowing  out. I thought, oh no! If hot sodium touches the air, it will burst into flame . . . The  white smoke of burning sodium filled the room, and I couldn’t see anymore in the  haze . . . Beep! Beep! The fire alarms started to go off. I was so scared (Monju-kun  2012b: 13–16). Much to Monju-kun’s disappointment, the uncles of Dōnen (Power Reactor and  Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, forerunner to JAEA) were slow to react  in his hour of need: “They didn’t stop the sodium pump, so I couldn’t stop wetting  my pants. It was so embarrassing and painful. I was very sad” (19). In the actual  accident, ninety minutes passed by before Dōnen halted the reactor, allowing 650  kilograms of sodium to leak. At a press conference the following day, Dōnen claimed that the accident wasn’t  serious, even though the total amount of sodium leaked was substantial, and that it  had no knowledge of conditions at the site of the accident, although it had already  taken a video of it. In the autobiographical narrative, an appalled Monju-kun  yelled, “The uncles are lying! . . . The pipe room is completely covered in white,” but  none of the reporters heard him (26–28). Subsequently, Dōnen edited the video to  make the accident look minor and held another press conference. Monju-kun was  again horrified by the lies: “I was so surprised, I almost wet my pants with sodium  </page> <page sequence="9"> Figure 16. Images of Monju-kun, from @monjukun, Twitter. Courtesy @monjukun, Insta- gram, April 29, 2012. </page> <page sequence="10"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    273 again” (31). Fed up with Dōnen’s vague responses, the people of Fukui prefecture  demanded to see the site themselves. The visit revealed the lie, and the resulting  scandal was well covered in the media. Nishimura Shigeo, the assistant manager  in charge of investigating the accident, was found dead, and his death was ruled  a suicide; his wife, who had previously worked for Dōnen, claimed he was mur- dered.8 Pressure from intense media coverage was blamed for his death, and the  media backed off from Monju. This event, which happened in real life, is set up as a defining moment for  Monju-kun, the character, who begins to question his identity and worth. As a fast-breeder reactor, exactly what am I? Until then, I had always been told, “You  are the reactor of dreams.” “If you succeed, Japan no longer has to worry about en- ergy” . . . I thought I was supporting the ambitions of Japanese science . . . But the sodium accident made me realize three important points. First, I break  easily and I’m dangerous . . . It hurt, it was hot, it was scary. I don’t ever want to ex- perience that again. Second, I make everyone worry . . . After I had the accident, residents in the area  were asking fearfully, “Should we evacuate?” . . . Third, I started to wonder if Dad, Dōnen, were really all right. I had always trust- ed Dad, because he was Dad . . . But during the accident, I kept saying, “It’s hot, it’s  hot!” but no one came to extinguish the fire. The uncles didn’t stop the nuclear reac- tor right away. They hesitated to drain the sodium so I continued to wet my pants. I  wondered if they really intended to take care of me. . . . They lied, they hid the video, they piled lies upon lies, and they use everyone’s tax  money for research but can’t explain it properly to outsiders. That’s dishonest. They  drive someone in their organization into a corner and don’t protect him . .  . Since  then, I have continued to wonder if my existence is really necessary. (Monju-kun  2012b: 36–40) MONJU-KUN’S  PERSONALITY This origin story highlights the key elements in Monju-kun’s character. First, he  is a child, and as a child, he is helpless: he is dependent on the uncles to prevent  accidents. As a child, Monju-kun (and by analogy, the Monju FBR) is blameless:  the accident is clearly the fault of the technological uncles of Dōnen, who have  designed him badly and cover it up. Second, he possesses the basic human goodness attributed to children (Mal- kki 2010; see chapter 5): he is an honest boy with a sense of morality and social  responsibility. He feels outrage at the cover-up of the Monju accident and is  deeply saddened by the reported suicides of the manager in charge of commu- nicating Monju’s accident in 1996 and the manager who was organizing repairs  in 2011.9 He laments that the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency had just been   rubber-stamping Dōnen’s materials: “I felt sad that people weren’t paying adequate  </page> <page sequence="11"> 274    Contemporary Japan attention. It scared me” (Monju-kun 2012b: 100). Fukuichi-kun’s accident also  makes him wonder if he’s really safe. When the uncles at the plants or the govern- ment claim, “It’s safe,” he feels more unsettled. Thirdly, he has the child’s ability to see the truth: he doubts the moral integrity  of his father and creator, Dōnen, and its successor, JAEA. Dependent on Dōnen,  Monju-kun feels betrayed by his uncles’ inability to “take care of him” by dealing  quickly with the accident. And as a seer of truth (Malkki 2010), Monju-kun recog- nizes that he is not the future of nuclear energy as he is purported to be. Like some  children unable to deal with unrealistic expectations, he retreats into a somewhat  nihilistic dream of retiring and being reborn as a solar cell in the Sahara. This depiction of a technology-based character in a moral conflict with his  father/creator locates Monju-kun in a tradition of character-types created by Tezuka  Osamu, the author of Astro Boy and considered the father of Japanese postwar  manga and animation. At the beginning of Astro Boy, Tobio, the son of Dr. Tenma,  the director-general of the Institute of Science, is killed in a turbo-car accident. The  bereaved father summons all the resources of the Institute to build Astro Boy, a boy  robot with an atomic generator as a source of energy, as a substitute for his son.  Tenma becomes disappointed when he doesn’t grow like a human boy. Dismissing  him as “just a robot,” he sells him to a cruel circus owner who makes Astro Boy fight  gladiator-style with other robots. Astro Boy recharges cast-off robots and mobilizes  them to rescue people from a circus fire. The passage of a robot bill of rights frees  him from the circus. Meanwhile, Dr. Tenma has been forced to resign from his  position, and the kindly Dr. Ochanomizu has replaced Dr. Tenma as the director of  the Institute. Ochanomizu adopts Astro Boy, who goes on to fight villains.10 Astro Boy shares with Monju-kun the attributes associated with children: like  Monju-kun, Astro Boy is an honest boy who seeks righteousness and truth. More- over, both embody an anxiety about technology and those who wield its power.  They are both powered by atomic energy and billed as technological marvels  (although Monju-kun’s wonders remain unmaterialized). Both father-creators are  powerful figures in science, the director-general of the Institute of Science mir- roring Dōnen’s position at the heart of Japanese research on nuclear power. Both  fathers are also deeply flawed: the director-general eventually loses his position,  and Dōnen, reorganized as Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), has been cen- sored by the new NRA for underreporting problems. Astro Boy is betrayed and  abandoned by his father, while Monju-kun is betrayed and misled by Dōnen/JAEA;  both harbor conflicting feelings about “dad.” Anne Allison surmises that Astro  Boy’s abandonment resonated with many in postwar Japan, who felt that military  leaders had betrayed and sacrificed them (Allison 2006: 57). Similarly, Monju-kun’s  betrayal and doubt over the leadership of nuclear power—and with it, the under- lying assumptions behind Japan’s technological and economic policies—echo the  feelings of many Japanese in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. For  Astro Boy, the emotional dissonance is resolved when the kindly Dr. Ochanomizu  </page> <page sequence="12"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    275 adopts him. For Monju-kun, no such adoptive parent materialized—just as in real  life, in which no organization stepped up to replace JAEA as the manager for the  Monju FBR. Szasz and Takechi have noted that “in Tezuka’s world, the robots, such as Astro  Boy, are often more human than humans themselves, as they deal with sadness,  fear, sorrow, and even remorse. Humans cause most of the problems in his stories”  (Szasz and Takechi 2007: 737). In other words, the technology-based character  (also a child) is socially responsible: it is the human (adult) who begets evil out  of technology. Similarly, Monju-kun and his nuclear-reactor friends—Fukuichi- kun, Hamaoka-kun, Ōi-kun, etc.—are worried that they are not truly safe; they  are disappointed in the humans who lie and engage in cover-ups. Fukuichi-kun  deeply regrets the consequences of his accident, for which Monju-kun blames the  Nuclear Village: “Fukuichi-kun .  .  . , I can see your tears. You can’t see them on  television because they’re mixing and disappearing with the continuing flow of  contaminated water, but I can see that you are crying tears of apology. You’re not  the one who’s bad! It’s the over-lenient plans and fraudulent inspections that are  bad!” (@monjukun, Twitter, May 13, 2011). Hence, Monju-kun, the innocent boy,  asserts that the technology of nuclear power is not inherently evil, but that humans  handle it in a problematic manner. Like Astro Boy, whose liminal position between the robot and human worlds  brings on an identity crisis, Monju-kun is highly anxious about his identity as a  nuclear reactor and the meaning of his existence. He laments when the Yomiuri  newspaper writes that nuclear power allows Japan to have plutonium, which is  the raw material for nuclear weapons (September 8, 2011). Unlike Astro Boy, who  responds heroically by fighting injustice, Monju-kun is remorseful about his very  existence. As mentioned previously, he wants his existence as Monju to end. This  pessimistic, unheroic withdrawal differentiates him from Astro Boy and other  nuclear-powered commercial characters. However, the social and economic dif- ficulties in the current society have led to an increase of NEETs—a person who  is not pursuing employment, education, or training—and hikikomori, or extreme  social withdrawal (Borovoy 2008; Furlong 2008). Monju-kun’s desire to withdraw  may have resonated with many young Japanese people. Indeed, Monju-kun’s depiction as a weakling may have made his character  more appealing. Childlike weakness and helplessness are key components of the  cuteness (kawaii) aesthetic, as they invite others to take care of that person or char- acter (Kinsella 1995). Monju-kun tends to highlight his physical weakness, which  draws the motherly attention of his followers. When Monju-kun tweeted exten- sively about his “operation” in June 2011 (mirroring a real-life effort to remove  fallen equipment from the FBR), so many followers tweeted “get well soon” mes- sages that M.C.’s Twitter app crashed. As M.C. observed, “The Japanese prefer something flawed or weak over some- thing perfect, like Nobita from Doraemon” (M.C. interview). In this long-running  </page> <page sequence="13"> 276    Contemporary Japan manga and anime series, Nobita is a boy who is always failing: he receives poor  grades at school, performs poorly at athletic activities, and can’t do anything right.  His descendant sends the robot cat Doraemon to protect Nobita from a hapless  future. Whenever Nobita gets into a bind, Doraemon tries to rescue him by pull- ing out a gadget, which Nobita misuses. Schilling (1993) notes that many children,  who are under extreme pressure to succeed in school and elsewhere, identify with  Nobita. And like Nobita, Monju-kun is under pressure to work, although he sim- ply can’t. According to Monju-kun’s author, “People can empathize more with an  incompetent kid like Nobita [than with a perfect kid]. Monju-kun, too, is very  weak physically, and he’s always failing, like the actual Monju FBR . . . Those types  of characters feel friendly and familiar to many people” (M.C. interview). And as  Monju-kun fit into this recognizable type, he appealed to more people, making  them more willing to listen to his explanations of nuclear power. Nobita has a marked lazy streak—another characteristic Monju-kun shares  with him. Building on the fact that the Monju FBR only operated for about six  months since its completion in 1991, Monju-kun calls himself “Japan’s number one  NEET” (@monjukun, Twitter, May 22, 2011). On his resume, he lists his special  skills as “loafing” and “using up a lot of money” (Monju-kun 2012b: 2). His T-shirts  and illustrations show Monju-kun hula-dancing and hunting for insects (a favorite  summer pastime for children) with the caption, “Every day is summer vacation”— a biting remark for the many Japanese who hardly get any vacation from their jobs. Another endearing element to Monju-kun’s character is his distinctive language.  He greeted followers in the morning with an “oha-oha” tagline to the common  greeting, “ohayō gozaimasu” (good morning). He also uses the distinctive “desu- dayo” sentence ending, combining two auxiliary verbs when either one alone would  suffice—the kind of mistake a child would make. M.C. explained that this pattern  was a form of keigo (polite language) when addressing evacuees and people of  higher status on Twitter.11 That is to say, Monju-kun is a polite, well-behaved child. Like Astro Boy, Monju-kun sought kinship outside of his original “family.” He  made his most frequent references to his nuclear reactor friends, comprised of  all the other reactors in Japan and pictured as a mutually supportive network of  coworkers in difficult environments. When the Hamaoka Nuclear Plant, which  sits directly over the subduction zone of two tectonic plates that are overdue for a  major earthquake, was taken off-line, Monju-kun tweeted, “I tried to call Hama- oka-kun to congratulate him on being taken off-line, but I couldn’t get through!  There’s a flood of congratulatory calls from Tsuruga-kun, Kashiwazaki-kun,   Shimane-kun—all the nuclear reactors in Japan. We all put on a brave face, but  we’re actually scared of earthquakes” (@monjukun, Twitter, May 9, 2011). Hence, Monju-kun’s cute personality, classic conflicts of father versus son and  technology versus humans, and multiplicity of associated subcharacters made him  both familiar and distinctive to Japanese, enhancing his acceptance. Let us now  explore how his popularity grew and how he was received in various forms. </page> <page sequence="14"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    277 MONJU’S  SPREAD ACROSS MEDIA PLATFORMS Monju-kun began his life as a Twitter account on May 4, 2011, tweeting little-known  stories about the Monju FBR in humorous, often sarcastic tones that resonated with  the angry mood at the time: Hello from atop an active fault! It’s me, Monju-kun (May 6, 2011). I don’t drink mother’s milk. I grew this big from everyone’s hard-earned taxpayer  money! (May 10, 2011) Monju-kun’s amusing manner quickly attracted the attention of the Twittersphere,  where many Japanese had congregated for news in those first few months after  3/11. He was quickly retweeted by influential tweeters such as musicians Soul  Flower Union, Gotch (Asian Kung-Fu Generation), Ōtomo Yoshihide, and Saka- moto Ryūichi, resulting in a rapid increase in followers (M.C. interview). These  endorsements encouraged musicians’ fans to follow Monju-kun and increased his  perceived trustworthiness. In ten weeks, he had over fifty thousand followers, and  in a year, he had nearly one hundred thousand. Monju-kun was chatty and interactive with his followers, who asked him “per- sonal” questions, in language similar to the way in which adults engage with chil- dren. Noting that Monju-kun had referred to his dad, a follower asked, “What  about your mom?” He responded, “The energy industry is a male-dominated  world, so there aren’t many moms. It doesn’t have any mom-oriented ideas either”  (June 14, 2011). When another asked, “What are your hobbies?” he responded, “I  wanted to try the tea ceremony, but [the water] would react with the sodium and  make it explode, so I gave it up” (September 10, 2011). But amid all the fun, Monju-kun’s easily understood messages quickly made  him a trusted authority to whom adults, particularly parents, could ask questions.  He corrected misunderstandings, gently telling one follower that he couldn’t use his  Geiger counter to measure radiation in food (“A Geiger counter measures sieverts;  when you eat vegetables, you want to know about bequerels,” May 13, 2011). When  a follower asked, “Is it all right to drink plutonium? . . . Ōhashi Hiroshi, a distin- guished professor from Tokyo University, said it’s fine to drink it” (@benntenn5283,  June 6, 2011), he emphatically replied, “Even if a professor says it’s all right, good  children must never drink it! If you choke, and it goes down your windpipe into  your lungs, you’d receive continuous doses of internal radiation” (June 6, 2011). Eventually M.C. was unable to keep up with the barrage of questions, and  Monju-kun moved into the authorship of books and blogs. First Monju-kun solic- ited questions from his followers under the hashtag #oshiete_monju. This Q&amp;A on  topics relating to nuclear policy and radiation formed the basis for his first book,  Teach Me, Monju-kun (Oshiete! Monju-kun; Monju-kun 2012a). Monju-kun found that while Twitter was good for transmitting sound bites, its  140 characters were not sufficient for discussing complicated issues. Furthermore,  </page> <page sequence="15"> 278    Contemporary Japan many Japanese still put greater trust in print media than in Internet sources: a  digital divide existed between regular Internet users and flip-phone users, and the  Internet, while less prone to censorship, suffered from an image of unreliability.  M.C. thus felt that Monju-kun would seem more trustworthy if the information  were packaged into a physical book from a reputable publisher (M.C. interview).  With the longer book format, M.C. was able to explain complex concepts in  nuclear science, give advice on avoiding radiation, debunk pronuclear arguments,  and present renewable energy as a viable alternative to nuclear power. In the guise of Monju-kun, M.C. published four books: Teach Me, Monju-kun  (Oshiete! Monju-kun, March 2012), an FAQ on nuclear power and radiation;  Goodbye, Monju-kun (Sayonara, Monju-kun, March 2012), an “autobiography”  explaining the accidents and problems of the Monju FBR; Energy of the Future  for Everyone (Monju-kun to miru! Yomu! Wakaru! Minna no mirai no enerugii,  July 2012), describing renewable energy sources; and Have We Changed Since 3/11?  (Monju-kun taidan-shū: 3.11 de bokura wa kawatta ka, 2014), a book about cul- tural responses to 3/11 featuring interviews with Sakamoto Ryūichi, artist Nara  Yoshitomo, photographer Suzuki Shin, philosopher Kokubun Kōichirō, and mar- tial arts researcher Kōno Yoshinori. Each of the first three books was supervised  by an expert in the field: environmental economics professor Ōshima Ken’ichi  and science education professor Samaki Takeo for Teach Me, Monju-kun; nuclear  physicist Kobayashi Keiji for Goodbye, Monju-kun; and Iida Tetsunari, director of  the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, for Energy of the Future for Everyone. M.C. wrote the books with mothers in mind, using simple, clear language so  that they could read them quickly and read them aloud to their children. So that  upper-elementary-school children would be able to read them on their own, the  books are printed in large letters with kana (phonetic spellings) for nearly all  Chinese characters. They also include a plethora of kid-friendly illustrations that  explain complicated concepts (e.g., the nuclear fuel cycle) or anthropomorphize  actual situations (e.g., Monju-kun bent over with a stomachache while leaked  sodium catches fire). The books have been received well, the first two books having sold more than  twenty thousand copies within the first month.12 Many readers tweeted that their  children were reading them: “Not satisfied with just having the book read to him,  our first grader is reading it himself, dictionary in hand” (@lovelovebonchan,  March 7, 2012). LIVE APPEARANCES Given Monju-kun’s popularity, it seemed only a matter of time before he appeared  live in stuffed costume, like a true wobbly mascot. In particular, he had already  been helping to spread information about demonstrations; in Twitter conversa- tions with individual followers, he sometimes gave them the extra push of courage  </page> <page sequence="16"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    279 Figure 17. Monju-kun at the TwitNoNukes demonstration, Shibuya, Tokyo, 29 April 2012.  Courtesy @monjukun, Instagram, April 29, 2012. they needed to participate in a public protest. As early as June 2011, demonstra- tors were already carrying hand-drawn images of his likeness. Monju-kun then  uploaded placards and round fans, which protesters downloaded and took to  demonstrations. When he finally appeared at a TwitNoNukes antinuclear dem- onstration in Shibuya, Tokyo, on April 29, 2012, protesters, particularly those with  children, were delighted to be greeted by him and posed for pictures with him  (see figure 17). Monju-kun was also a big hit at the Sayonara Genpatsu (Goodbye, Nuclear  Power Plants) rally and demonstration on July 16, 2012, which attracted 170,000  protesters. Fans of all ages—both adults and children—came up to hug him and  take pictures with him.13 He entertained protesters in a skit with journalist Tsuda  Daisuke on a big stage, declaring himself the King of NEETs for receiving an  “allowance” of 55 million yen a day (“I took a taxi from Tsuruga! . . . Not even a  dent in my allowance!”).14 </page> <page sequence="17"> 280    Contemporary Japan Monju-kun also participated in a number of music festivals, such as No  Nukes, Project Fukushima Festival, and Fuji Rock Festival’s Atomic Café stage.  At the Atomic Café in 2013, Monju-kun performed in a skit with Suishinger—the  comedy unit Okome Takeru no Ichiza’s “superhero” trio representing pronuclear  forces—TEPCO (in red leotards), METI (blue), and mass media (white); “suishin”  means “to promote” (in this case, nuclear power).15 Monju-kun told them that he  didn’t want to work, reminding the audience that the sodium in him will explode  if combined with water—“If I start sweating from working, it’ll be dangerous!”  Suishinger bullied him, saying, “Just pretend you’re going to work at some point.”  As Monju-kun cried, his tears of sodium generated smoke, causing Suishinger to  flee. Tsuda Daisuke joined Monju-kun onstage, mentioning the moves by the Lib- eral Democratic Party, which had just returned to power, to restart twelve “nuclear  reactor friends,” all of which Monju-kun named. Monju-kun reported that the  NRA had forbidden restarting him because the JAEA had failed to conduct safety  checks on ten thousand pieces of equipment. The skit entertained children while  updating adults on the current status of nuclear power.16 A child was overheard  asking his mother, “Do we not need nuclear power?” Monju-kun finished the skit by dancing to his theme song, “Monju-kun ondo,”  based on a common Japanese song style (explained below). Music is usually part  of a character’s packaging: many characters are identified with the theme songs of  their anime (e.g., Astro Boy) or videogame (e.g., Nintendo’s Super Mario). Typi- cally these songs summarize the premise and highlight the personality of charac- ters; e.g., “I’m Doraemon” (Boku Doraemon) introduces the robot cat as one that  can solve any problem. M.C. felt that the Monju FBR was so “patently absurd” that “only a song could  make people learn about it.” M.C. chose the ondo style because it “is the most  common type of Japanese song. Everyone knows it. It doesn’t have to be trendy or  cool” (M.C. interview). Originally a type of traditional call-and-response song and  dance associated with particular localities and summertime bon festivals, the ondo  was commercialized into a popular song form played with Western instruments in  the 1920s. Today, many places, situations, personalities, and characters (e.g., Dor- aemon) have their own ondo. M.C. was familiar with the music of traditional ondo,  having participated in many bon festivals, and found the lyrical pattern of ondo,  which alternates lines of seven and five morae (short syllables) like haiku, straight- forward to write. The cheery music of Monju-kun’s theme song sports the penta- tonic melody and dotted rhythm characteristic of a commercial ondo. The song  was made available for download on the Project Fukushima site and for streaming  on Soundcloud and YouTube.17 Audiences have responded positively, with bemusement, to the song at live per- formances. M.C. attributed this reception to the sheer familiarity of the form: When you play it at an event, that ondo has a devastating impact. . . . with an ondo,  everyone is on the same page, because everyone knows the ondo. Everyone can sing  </page> <page sequence="18"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    281 it and has danced to it before. It’s something everyone has in common, something  the body remembers . . . [The ondo] also embarrasses the Japanese. In their daily lives, Japanese people  tend to hide anything in the culture that seems Japanese. Ondo is definitely one of  those things  .  .  . You wouldn’t sing one at a karaoke bar. Because you’ve hidden it  away in a closet, you giggle when you hear an ondo. Just when you’re smirking, the  lyrics grab you. (M.C. interview) Another reason for this reception may be the absurdity of having a giant stuffed  character dance, jump at the word “explosion,” and cover his mouth at “pluto- nium,” all to lyrics that describe a dead-serious situation; the incongruity itself  is enough to make one laugh, just as incongruous mash-ups do. The song’s three  verses succinctly explain the issues with the Monju FBR: that both the sodium  it uses for cooling and the plutonium it uses for fuel are extremely dangerous;  that it remains unfinished despite fifty years of planning and testing; that a seri- ous accident was covered up; that the FBR is more difficult to control than other  nuclear reactors; and that every other developed country has already given up on  this technology. Its chorus begins by reminding us that “the annual budget is 20  billion yen,” that “it’s called the reactor of dreams, but it’s a nightmare from which  we haven’t awakened,” and that it would “ruin Lake Biwa if there were an accident.”  In simple words that a child could mostly understand, coupled with a familiar  ondo melody, the song is catchy and easy to learn. It replicates the long-held Japa- nese practice of using music to teach children, as in the case of Meiji-era school  songs that teach Confucian values or the recent wobbly mascot Kumamon’s song,  which teaches children to overcome difficulties. But the recording also replicates  the mother-child dynamic seen throughout the Monju-kun character: a woman- mother is singing, while a sprightly boy yelps the response pattern: “Mon, Mon,  Mon-ju, hai, hai, hai-ro” (Monju, shut it down). CONCLUSION Through the tropes of Japanese character culture—a cute, fuzzy being, with the  father-son conflicts and technology-human ambiguities that shape Astro Boy or  Doraemon—Monju-kun provided a nonthreatening and fun conduit to inform  citizens, particularly mothers, about nuclear power and radiation. He exemplified  the political usefulness of children’s culture, whose friendly, familiar, and comfort- ing associations made it a perfect foil for transmitting technically difficult infor- mation like nuclear fission or contentious situations like the problematic Monju  reactor. In addition, Japanese children’s culture also permeates adult culture, due  not only to the participation of parents in their children’s culture but also to the  Japanese attraction to cuteness. Children’s culture has historically been used in  public relations (e.g., Denko, Pluto-kun) or outright propaganda, as with chil- dren’s songs during World War II. Other antinuclear activists and musicians also  </page> <page sequence="19"> 282    Contemporary Japan used children’s culture, such as Saitō Kazuyoshi’s antinuclear songs based on Aesop  tales, Acid Black Cherry and Coma-chi’s concept albums written as children’s sto- ries, and Scha Dara Parr and Hikashū’s references to Godzilla, while visual artists  such as Sayonara Atom applied the cuteness aesthetic to banners for demonstra- tions. As M.C. inferred, most Japanese may find it hard to discuss the nuclear  crisis, but they also find it hard to get mad at cute, childlike things or reminders of  childhood. And like a child without social filters (see chapter 5), Monju-kun was  able to speak the truth about nuclear power and get away with it. Monju-kun’s beginnings and primary existence on the Internet also illustrate  how important the anonymity of cyberspace has been in disseminating informa- tion and sustaining discussion outside of mainstream-media narratives. Anonym- ity allowed not only both M.C. and Monju-kun’s followers to speak out. Having  amassed a large following on Twitter, M.C., under the Monju-kun nom de plume,  wrote informative and accessible books that a child could read, while the charac- ter, in stuffed costume, attracted parents, children, and fans to antinuclear dem- onstrations and festivals. The combination of the cute, approachable character and  timely dissemination made Monju-kun a crucial source of information under a  spiral of silence. In November 2015, the NRA announced that JAEA could no longer manage the  Monju plant. It instructed the education and science ministry (MEXT) to find a  new manager or consider closing the plant. After a ministry report failed to lay out a  reform plan or identify a new operator, Cabinet members agreed in September 2016  to decommission Monju, at an estimated cost of 375 billion yen ($3.3  billion) over  thirty years, and the government formally confirmed this decision in  December  2016. However, the Cabinet did not shift policy away from nuclear fuel recycling:  the government plans to build a demonstration fast-breeder reactor in Fukui, the  same prefecture that hosted Monju. Japan has a forty-eight-ton  plutonium stock- pile, which it has justified through the nuclear fuel recycling program. Meanwhile, Monju-kun’s creator appears to have gone on with life. Monju-kun  stopped tweeting shortly after the fifth anniversary of 3/11, without a goodbye. In  his last tweets, he sounded optimistic over Monju’s potential decommissioning but  resigned over Japan’s inability to give up nuclear power; asked by an inquisitive  child as to why the nuclear accident had to happen, he said he still did not have  simple words to explain. But Monju-kun hadn’t disappeared from the minds of his fans. As the news  on Monju flowed, they revisited his books, articles, and songs, reposting them on  Twitter as quick refreshers on the problematic reactor. Monju-kun had entered  the discourse on this reactor: in discussing its potential decommissioning, many  Twitter users referred to it as Monju-kun, discussing the reactor as if it actually  were the little boy of the character. They credited him for making them aware of  the Monju controversy. As Monju-kun remained inactive in the face of decom- missioning news, fans became increasingly mystified by his silence; they tweeted  </page> <page sequence="20"> Monju-kun and Children’s Culture    283 that they missed his wry, friendly commentary. They were also concerned for the  creator’s well-being; as one might with an ill or lost friend, they tweeted to other  antinuclear avatars—Pluto-kun and the Zeronomics bear—to ask after him. They  showed their affection for him by posting their personal memories of him, such as  their own photos of Monju-kun badges or Monju-kun in stuffed costume, or imi- tating his characteristic desu-dayo speech pattern. When Monju’s decommission  was confirmed, fans again poured out their affection, posting pictures of him with  the caption, “Good-bye Monju-kun,” sometimes with a wistful comment about the  character’s disappearance: “He must be happy that he can retire” (@mem_no_koe,  December 21, 2016). Like a lost lover in an enka lyric, Monju-kun was gone, but the  feelings of his fans lingered. Through the trope of children’s culture, Monju-kun’s funny, biting, and often- times absurd manner attracted people to his Twitter feed and books, bringing atten- tion to the issue of Monju, which had become obscure and forgotten at the time of  3/11. He engaged them not only intellectually but also affectively, inviting them to  learn, think, discuss, and become passionate about the future of nuclear energy. NOTES 1.
