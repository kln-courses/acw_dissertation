<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> chapter 8 Aristotle’s Organism, and Ours Emanuela Bianchi How does an entity come to be? The production of artifacts is of course easily explained through the technical human capacity for identifying  (and indeed – under capitalism – generating) needs and wants, and designing  and manufacturing solutions from cooking vessels to drone weapons. But,  despite the advances of systems chemistry, molecular biology, and both eco- logical and developmental biology, the coming to be or ontogenesis of natural  entities remains fundamentally mysterious, both in the sense of the original  emergence of living order from its physico-chemical environment, and in the  sense of the development of an individual organism from germ cell to adult  form. Arguably, it is this latter mystery that is Aristotle’s own central problem- atic (Aristotle’s universe is one that maintains itself in perpetuity and therefore  questions of cosmic origins and the origin of life do not concern him). This  ontogenesis has at least two registers: the metaphysical and the biological – the  coming to be of beings qua their being, or the question of how a thing emerges  where there was no thing before, on the one hand, and the specifi c biological  mechanisms involved in natural coming to be, on the other. While Aristotle’s  metaphysics of becoming has perhaps its most programmatic account in the  fi rst books of the Physics, called by Heidegger the “hidden, and therefore never  adequately studied, foundational book of Western philosophy,”1 the specifi c  mechanisms of natural becoming, at least in the animal kingdom, are covered  in Generation of Animals.  Technical metaphors of course abound in Aristotle’s accounts of coming-to- be: we are all familiar with the bronze sphere or the statue as the paradigmatic  hylomorph, the composite of matter and form as essential causes of an entity,  the τόδε τι or “this something” that is the central deictic object of Aristotle’s  ontological investigations.2 To round out the roster of four essential causes, we  might add the moving cause or ἀρχὴ κινήσεως, which is the craftsman himself,  and the fi nal cause or “that for the sake of which,” the purpose which the  object will serve, for which it is made. Nonetheless the primary problem, the  wondrous mystery that all this is marshaled to explain, is the natural organism,  </page> <page sequence="2">  aristotle’s organism, and ours 139 and it is this that forms the central locus of Aristotle’s investigations, and in  which the metaphor of technical production plays a pivotal part. The organism –  unifi ed, integrated, and complete, an uncreated functional totality of parts and  whole – is the very subject and substance of Aristotelian inquiry. As is well  known, Aristotle spends the central books of the Metaphysics wrestling with  how to conceive of such a substance. For, if this substance is a composite of  matter and form, the question arises – what is the ground of its unity? How  can it be unifi ed or thought of as a unity? Aristotle fi rst examines form, then  matter, as possible candidates for the primary substance that would underlie  the whole, and fi nally rejects each in turn, reasserting the irreducibility of the  matter-form complex for the τόδε τι. In the text the problem is resolved, in a  sense, by a change of frame. By turning, in Book Θ, to the potentiality-actuality  schema, Aristotle is fi nally able to treat the “this,” and a fortiori the organism,  as a unity that may be understood according to its δύναμις, that is its capacity,  potential or possibility – and its ἐνεργεία or ἐντελεχεία, its activity, actuality,  and completion.3 Preparing for this turn, towards the end of Book H, he writes,  “the proximate matter [ὕλη] and the form [μορφὴ] are one and the same; the  one exists potentially, the other as actuality [&lt;τὸ μὲν&gt; δυνάμει, τὸ δὲ ἐνεργείᾳ].  Therefore to ask the cause of the unity is like asking the cause of unity in gen- eral; for each individual thing is one, and the potential and the actual are in  a sense one.”4 It is noteworthy that Aristotle is only able to claim any sort of  unity for the composite entity once it is considered from the point of view of  its development, in process and in motion over time, a motion and process that  is, for him, necessarily directed toward an endpoint, a τέλος that has absolute  conceptual primacy.5 We will return later to the question of the nature of the  unity designated by the potentiality-actuality schema, and in particular that of  the “being at completion” indicated by ἐνεργεία and ἐντελεχεία. This view of the organism as de facto total, unifi ed, and complete-in-itself has  had, in turn, a variegated fate in the history of philosophy and in the biologi- cal sciences. The organism – especially the animal organism, with its unity, its  structure of interrelated parts contributing to the functioning of the whole,  its development from relatively simple origins to an extensively differentiated  complexity, the way it is distinguished from its surroundings by a boundary  (membrane, integument, carapace, or skin), the operations by which it con- tinually connects with and differentiates itself from the external world – the  organism maintains and propagates itself through nutrition, growth, healing,  reproduction, locomotion, and perception. All of these mark it out as a specifi c  sort of phenomenon in the world that, in virtue of its mysterious unity in com- plexity, impresses itself upon the philosopher who, like Aristotle, is interested  in the “why” of things. In modernity, a nexus of problems grows up around the  fi gure of the organism, exemplifi ed by a vigorous debate that emerges among  nineteenth-century biologists. The confl ict is between mechanists, who seek to  explain all biological processes reductively in terms of purely physical elements  obeying a kind of billiard-ball causality, and those who invoke vital forces  </page> <page sequence="3"> 140 emanuela bianchi such as the soul, “entelechies,” “archeon,” or life itself, a tendency dismissed  as an unfortunate and archaic mysticism bearing the name of Aristotelianism.  In philosophy, Kant’s Third Critique, Kritik der Urteilskraft, argues that  the organism cannot be understood by the determinate judgements that  observe linear, billiard-ball causality. Instead a different sort of judgement  must be brought to bear on this object in order to make sense of its recipro- cal arrangement of parts and whole and the apparent purposiveness of its  being: refl ective judgement. This is not to say that purpose is a part of nature,  something Kant strictly denies (since he believes such a notion would require  a designer); rather, the idea of a teleology or fi nal cause of nature is necessar- ily projected upon the organism, by us, as we confront and seek to under- stand it.6 This thoroughly modern approach, in which our own perceptual  and cognitive apparatuses (indeed our own very organismic being) enters into  our knowledge of the organism remains central to twentieth-century phenom- enological and psychoanalytic approaches, wherein interest in the organism  cannot but refl ect, at least in part, our own anthropomorphic and narcissis- tic obsession with ourselves. Elaine P. Miller has shown how, for example,  Nietzsche’s dismissal of the ontological signifi cance of the organism in favor  of an understanding of nature as multiple, discontinuous, and erratic is rooted  in his reading of Kant and Goethe’s critiques of teleology.7 For Nietzsche, the  totality represented by the organism is provisional and precarious, an anthro- pomorphizing abstraction; following both Kant and Goethe, he contends that  any sense of teleological purpose is a fi ction. This rejection of the unity and  totality represented by organicist thinking, and the resulting demise of the  organism as a key philosophical entity is, in the twentieth century, paralleled  in the biological sciences with the modern synthesis of Darwinian evolutionary  theory and Mendelian genetics. The former takes species and populations as  more fundamental than individual organisms in driving biological processes,  while the latter roots the focus of biology in the microbiological and molecu- lar processes of the gene. This synthesis, as Richard Lewontin puts it, brings  biology “at last into conformity with the epistemological metastructure that  already characterized physics since Newton and chemistry since Lavoisier.”8  This tendency is felt throughout the biology of the most recent century, with its  emphases on materialism in evolution, the molecule, single-celled prokaryotes  and archaea, the ecosystem, phylogenetics, and most recently informatics and  data-driven approaches. What is absent is the selfsame, midsize, biological  organism.9  This turn away from the organism and toward processes that unfold over  time at both macro and micro levels is found in strains of philosophical think- ing stretching from Nietzsche to Henri Bergson, Alfred North Whitehead,  Gilbert Simondon, and most explicitly and polemically in the thought of Gilles  Deleuze and Félix Guattari. For the latter, the organism represents not simply  an anthropomorphic projection, but a truly fascistic imposition of the tenden- cies of hierarchy, sovereignty, organization, stratifi cation, and Oedipal repro- ductive sexuality upon an open fi eld of fl ows, intensities, and indeterminate  </page> <page sequence="4">  aristotle’s organism, and ours 141 potentialities designated as the Body without Organs.10 All of these philoso- phers, interested in the unfolding of temporal processes, in becoming rather  than in static, if not ossifi ed, states of being, have no diffi culty invoking  ontologies of force: Bergson, for example, in Creative Evolution, writes that  “life is like a current passing from germ to germ through the medium of a  developed organism. It is as if the organism itself were only an excrescence,  a bud caused to sprout by the former germ endeavouring to continue itself  in a new germ.”11 Bergson certainly does not pass over the organism or liv- ing body entirely, for “it is an individual, and of no other object, not even of  the crystal, can this be said, for a crystal has neither difference of parts nor  diversity of function.”12 And yet, for him this individuation is only a tendency  whose limits are made manifest by the phenomena of reproduction taking  place over a super-organismic timespan. Of course, since Darwin, the mecha- nisms by which complexity can arise no longer require an explanation that  invokes mystical forces. So, for Bergson, the limitation of mechanistic think- ing is not that it cannot account for complex organization, but that it cannot  countenance time, and the force that works through time, as real. Indeed, for  Bergson mechanism includes not just the classical physical causality of bil- liard balls, but also a causality that may act by means of releasing (as with the  explosive force in dynamite unleashed by a fl ame) or unwinding (as with the  potential energy contained in a spring). Yet mechanism is still insuffi cient for  explaining the push to complexity observable in the phenomenal of life. The  force of time, possessing “effective action and reality of its own,” is invisible  to mechanists, and Bergson sees in this mechanist limitation an unbearable  sense of loneliness and dissatisfaction which follows the thought of a pro- cess without fi nality or end.13 The modern Kantian notion of refl ective judge- ment, in which teleological explanations are invoked insofar as they satisfy  us, would seem to be at work here, and yet Bergson is not simply reinscribing  the traditional opposition between mechanism and teleology exemplifi ed by  the individuation of the organism. For him, the notion of the organism as  such, as animated by a vital principle, also runs aground on the shore of the  insuffi ciency of internal fi nality or “absolutely distinct individuality”14 as evi- denced in the phenomena of reproduction or, indeed, autoimmunity, in which  a phagocyte attacks the very organism that sustains it.15 Notable in both Bergson’s thinking and also in Nietzsche’s thought, infl ected  by Empedocles, is the identifi cation of an anti-teleological, destructive ten- dency in nature. Bergson affi rms that “life does not proceed by the association  and addition of elements, but by dissociation and division,”16 while Nietzsche  fi nds the occasional unifi cations of life seen at the level of the organism as pro- visional and desultory, in a world mostly constituted by “erratic and arbitrary  forces that encounter each other in unending strife.”17 Nietzsche opposes Aris- totle here not simply with his endorsement of Empedocles’ proto-evolutionary  stance (against which Aristotle repeatedly polemicizes),18 but also with an echo  of Aristotle’s student, companion, and critic Theophrastus, for whom “the  good is something rare and in few [things], whereas evil is much in number.”19 </page> <page sequence="5"> 142 emanuela bianchi The shift away from organismic thinking we are tracing continues in the  mid-twentieth-century work of Gilbert Simondon, who incorporates the  social collective and sensory environment into the organism’s purview in his  investigations into individuation. Simondon attends not only to the organ- ism’s interactions with its environment or external milieu as inherent to its  becoming, but also to its interior milieu, to the pluripotentiality of the devel- oping being – the fact that it could realize any number of developmental  pathways. In so doing, he, like Bergson, analyzes the organism’s inherent  out-of-phaseness with itself, its non-self-sameness, as key to its development.  What results is a new conception of “metastability” in which ontogenesis  is understood from the point of view of a process of becoming that funda- mentally displaces the substantial fi nality of the adult individual.20 And in  contemporary biology, disciplines such as cellular and molecular biology,  genetics, immunology, microbiology, bioinformatics, and approaches such  as medical ecology have emphasized the permeability and precariousness of  organismic and cell boundaries, as well as foregrounding web-like constitu- tive interrelationships between and within the organism and its surround- ings, both macro and microscopic. The organism has, in Goethean fashion,  become multiple rather than unifi ed, and concepts such as the microbiome  have come to take its place. In this view, an “organism” is a collectivity of  symbiotic beings constantly interacting with their environment, such that,  for example, one no longer “catches” a fungal infection such as Candida  albicans from a hostile exterior environment, but one rather experiences  an imbalance that leads to an overgrowth of one element that is already  part of one’s being qua microbiome.21 In evolutionary terms, too, the rise  of that most unitary of creatures, the eukaryotic single-celled organism, is  now widely (if not universally) understood to be the result not simply of  accumulated genetic mutations, but of certain chimerical, symbiotic cellu- lar incorporations. Intracellular organelles like mitochondria (the energy- generating centers within cells), chloroplasts (in which photosynthesis takes  place), or plasmids are thought to have once been prokaryotic bacteria in  their own right, at one time in evolutionary history ingested but not digested  by another host bacterium.22 This leads to a very different view of the organ- ism, and of health and disease, displacing the view that even something as  life-threatening as cancer should be thought of as an external enemy to be  vanquished. As Dorion Sagan puts it: “[organelles within the cell that were  once bacteria] are now generally well behaved, although cancer is notewor- thy for the rampant multiplication of the occasionally vampiric mitochon- dria.”23 In a Foucauldian register, Ed Cohen has shown how the development  of discourse on the immune system in the late nineteenth century, so central  to the contemporary conception of a healthy and well-defended organism,  relies on a political dispositif of war and defense against a hostile environ- ment, tracing the roots of the very notion of “immunity” to Roman law  rather than to the texture and tissue of biological membranes and processes.24  According to the new models of the body emerging from these discourses,  </page> <page sequence="6">  aristotle’s organism, and ours 143 the notion of the “foreign body,” of what is other to the organism, is as much  internal as it is external; no amount of fortifi cation can keep this alterity at  bay. The phenomena of life, according to these critiques, appear irreducibly  plural and relational, the unity of the organism all but disappears, and the  “norms” of “normal” and “healthy” versus “pathological” or “diseased”  are, as Georges Canguilhem presciently argued from the 1940s onward, no  longer easily opposable or extricable.25 What, then, can a return to the Aristotelian text offer the contemporary  thinking of multiplicity, of networks, of anti-normativity and molecularity?  Aristotle’s thought is without doubt the site where the organism is instituted  as metaphysically hegemonic, where its healthy functioning is offered as a  paradigm of being as ἐνεργεία. I seek to show here, in brief, that, against his  explicit intentions, there are elements at work in the biological texts that  offer a more complex view of the being of the organism.26 To clarify, I am not  arguing that Aristotle was something like a contemporary ecological thinker  all along. Rather, I want to offer a picture of his thought in which his valori- zation of organismic unity and healthy functioning as a sign of what is best  are continually vitiated by unassimilable factors – by material forces, compul- sions, and vicissitudes that work to undermine any claims to metaphysical  and ethical unity. I argue that these diffi culties and ἀπορίαι may be best under- stood through the fi gure of the female offspring, understood as (what I call)  “the feminine symptom.” Putting gender at the center of the discourse on the  organism will serve, I hope, to clarify some of the stakes of understanding the  organism in its normative and topological dimensions, and thus to assist in a  reassessment of its contemporary status. Before developing this notion of the feminine symptom, it is necessary  to be as clear as possible about Aristotle’s conception of γένεσις, of natural  coming to be. In the Generation of Animals, as is well known, the male pos- sesses the principle of movement and generation, and the female possesses  the material principle. The scene of sexual reproduction thus illuminates in  explicit detail the active transfer of a moving, generative, formative masculine  principle upon passive feminine matter. The natures of form and matter are  not, however, a simple issue for Aristotle. Coming-to-be, as we learn early on  in the Physics, has three components: a privation of the form to come, the  form to which the developing thing is destined, and the matter. The matter is  the substrate for the change and abides the process, admitting form’s presence  from its prior absence. Matter thus “admits of both contraries,” as Aristotle  puts it in Metaphysics Λ, that is the form (A), and its contrary, the privation  (not-A).27 Insofar as the non-material causes (formal, motive, and fi nal) act  upon the matter, the matter is transformed into A, while the privation that is  form’s contrary, not-A, is destroyed. On the one hand, then, matter is the substrate, the ὑποκείμενον that under- lies the form; it is the passive subject of change that persists and endures. On  the other hand, it is a site that somehow includes and encompasses privation  </page> <page sequence="7"> 144 emanuela bianchi or lack as a very part of its being, a lack that offers itself up to destruction as  form is progressively installed. As the potter forms the jar, the clay (as malleable  matter) yields, giving up its formlessness to the destined form. Or, as Aristotle  puts it in Physics I.9, matter yearns for and stretches out toward (ἐφίεσθαι καὶ  ὀρέγεσθαι) the divine and the good. Matter, in this passage, literally desires form,  just as, he writes, “the female which desires the male and the ugly which desires  the beautiful.”28 Already we notice something odd here. We fi nd matter (which  is paradigmatically passive in relation to the masculine form) behaving like an  obscure subject of desire, somehow internally motile, vectoral, and inclined or  impelled toward form. Likewise, in De Caelo, Aristotle explains the movement  of the elements toward their proper places – fi re and air upward, earth and  water downward –with recourse to the notion of an inclination or ῥοπή that  manifests in lightness and heaviness – a tendency to move toward proper place  which is fi nally understood according to the potentiality-actuality schema.29  Here, then, matter is already folded in advance into the potentiality-actuality  schema, into a scene of teleological becoming. Its incipient, vectoral orientation  toward form is evident not simply because it lies in readiness, waiting to be  acted upon and enformed, but rather insofar as it bears in itself an impulsion,  an obscure and untheorized, perhaps untheorizable, source of motion. It is obe- diently and inevitably directed toward form, stretching out and desiring – if not  quite actively, then at least in the middle voice: ἐφίεσθαι καὶ ὀρέγεσθαι. Yet the role of matter in the biological texts, and especially in the biology  of sexual reproduction, turns out to be rather more complex than even this  duality between pure passivity and obscure impulsivity indicates, especially on  account of what is implied by this impulsivity, that is that, in direct contrast to  every explicit claim, matter may in fact move itself. In Aristotle’s discourse on  heredity in Generation of Animals and in his account of the role of αὐτόματον  in reproduction in the Metaphysics, matter is revealed as the source of vicious  disruptions that disturb the orderly passing of paternal form from one genera- tion to the next. Let us consider the following highly illustrative quote from  Generation of Animals IV.3: Males take after their father more than their mother, females after their  mother. Some take after none of their kindred, although they take after  some human being at any rate; others do not take after a human being  at all in their appearance, but have gone so far that they resemble a  monstrosity, and, for the matter of that, anyone who does not take after  his parents is really in a way a monstrosity, since in these cases Nature  has in a way strayed [παρεκβέβηκε] from the generic type. The fi rst  beginning of this deviation is when a female is formed instead of a male,  though (a) this indeed is a necessity required by Nature, since the race of  creatures which are separated into male and female has got to be kept in  being; and (b) since it is possible for the male sometimes not to gain the  mastery [κρατεῖν] either on account of youth or age or some other such  cause, female offspring must of necessity be produced by animals.30  </page> <page sequence="8">  aristotle’s organism, and ours 145 There is a lot going on here. Nature is capable of straying from its predestined  path toward form and the good. In sexual reproduction, things can go wrong  and the male fails to gain the mastery (κράτος, a political concept), resulting in  a female offspring. The factors and circumstances that may contribute to such  an outcome have already been listed by Aristotle, and include factors internal  to the organism (the parents may be too young, too old, too fl uid or feminine  of body) as well as external factors. Indeed, the wind may be in the south, or  copulating animals may simply be facing the south, which would contribute  to a defi ciency of heat, leading to the failure of the masculine principle.31 If  the defi ciency is mild, a female is the result, if it is greater, the offspring is a  monstrosity. But whence do such defi ciencies arise? Clearly, they inhere in the  material and environmental conditions of conception, both internal and exter- nal, the aleatory, plural, and unpredictable vagaries of the material world,  with matter here acting against nature’s unfolding rather than for it, acting  against the smooth reproduction of masculine form, disrupting its action and  its mastery. At the same time – and here the notion of the feminine symptom comes into  view – nature requires such defi ciencies in order for the cyclical teleology of  sexual generation to occur. What I am calling symptomatic here is that which  is both necessary to the teleology and disruptive of teleology, rendering their  confl uence therefore strictly speaking inexplicable. A formulation from Judith  Butler’s Bodies that Matter may help to clarify this sense of the symptom:  “A constitutive or relative outside is, of course, composed of a set of exclusions  that are nevertheless internal to that system as its own nonthematizable neces- sity. It emerges within the system as incoherence, disruption, a threat to its own  systematicity.”32 If this understanding of symptomaticity – as nonthematizable  necessity, as that which both exceeds and founds a system – is deconstruc- tively expedient, the Greek meaning and etymology of symptom, σύμπτωμα,  multiplies this serendipity. Σύμπτωμα is literally a falling together (from συμ-,  together + πίπτω, to fall), anything that befalls one: coincidence is its Latinate  cognate. It may refer to chance, mischance, or calamity.33 The falling together  of the σύμπτωμα suggests both an unexpected, unchosen, forceful downward  motion, and an irreducible plurality, the falling of more than one thing together,  at the same time. The symptom here describes not only the production of a  female offspring as the unexpected conjunction of winds in the south with cop- ulation, but it also involves an unstable valence of matter, such that it is both  obedient and destructive, or obedient through its destruction.  If destruction sounds too strong here, a closer examination of the mecha- nisms involved in sexual reproduction (and, more specifi cally, in heredity) is  in order. First of all, there is the strange transformation of scale from the tiny  deviation in temperature to the contrariety or opposition of sexual difference.  When the failure of mastery occurs, “the material must change over into its  opposite condition. Now the opposite of the male is the female.”34 “Such a small  thing may tip the scale and be the cause of heat and cold,” says Aristotle;35 a  defi ciency of heat causes a transformation into an opposite. Note the shift from  </page> <page sequence="9"> 146 emanuela bianchi a scalar notion of temperature to one of discrete contraries, resulting from an  agonistic, politically characterized struggle between spermatic heat and environ- mental conditions – material conditions that might be either inside or outside the  mother’s body, indeterminately.  But again, such accidents will necessarily happen. A small deviation from  the ideal temperature, then, generates the required female; a larger deviation  creates occasional “monstrosities” (τέρατα): calves with two heads, babies  with six fi ngers, and the like. In this way, femininity can be seen to function as  a sign of, and a fi gure for, masculine failure. An error in the concoction of the  offspring reveals a susceptibility of the natural, telic unfolding of organismic  reproduction to another kind of necessity, a necessity inherent in the forces  or compulsions of matter. Aside from noting the deep misogyny in theorizing  femaleness as a mild form of monstrosity, and indeed the profound normativ- ity inherent in the Aristotelian cosmos, how are we to understand this ἀπορία,  this strange confl uence, this necessary coinciding – note the echo of σύμπτωμα  here – of two different orders of necessity in the reproduction of the female? While a consideration of the mechanisms of heredity and of spontaneous  generation cannot solve this ἀπορία, it may shed some light on the processes at  work and deliver us resources within the Aristotelian text for a rather differ- ent conception of the organism than that governed solely by the τέλος of unity  and substance. How, for example, may a male offspring resemble his mother,  or a female offspring her father? If all goes well, the motion deriving from the  male creates a shape after its own pattern, and the male resembles his father.  However, if this process fails, such failure may take a number of different paths,  depending on which faculty or δύναμις in the male fails to gain mastery. In the  case of a son looking like his mother, Aristotle contends that this is a result  of a kind of departure from type or destruction – an ἐξίστασθαι of the male  power or potentiality (δύναμις), this time not qua male but qua individual. The  mother’s characteristics then appear, not as a result of the presence or actual- ity of any formal principle or power on her part, but merely as a result of an  absence, an ablation of the sperm’s individualizing δύναμις. Aristotle distin- guishes two decisive mechanisms: ἐξίστασθαι, a destruction or “departure from  type” that permits femaleness or maternal characteristics to appear by default,  and λύεσθαι, a lapsing, loosening, or slackening in which case the characteris- tics of grandparents (of the same sex) and former ancestors comes to the fore.  So if the father’s δύναμις, qua individual, slackens or loosens, the son resembles  the grandfather. Ἐξίστασθαι is thus the result of a pure failure of masculinity,  while λύεσθαι signifi es that the agent (ποιοῦν), while still there, is acted upon by  that on which it acts, presumably by latent δυνάμει residing in the reproductive  material (which are never otherwise theorized); thus a heating agent may end  up being cooled, or vice versa.36  This ἐκ-στάσις of ἐξίστασθαι represents a derangement or departure from  where something stands, a putting out of place of the self-standing upright- ness of masculinity. The slackening, or loosening, λύεσθαι, is by contrast  rather a passive failure; it does not involve the forceful element of violent  </page> <page sequence="10">  aristotle’s organism, and ours 147 transformation, but results rather in a μετα-βαίνειν, a walking over, to the  next ancestor in line. According to Aristotelian usage, ἐξίστασθαι signifi es a  departure from being that is an inherent possibility within matter, insofar as  matter is the site of the very possibility of being and not being. Matter, then,  is the site of a destructive deviation that leads to an overthrow of the mas- culine power of production and transformation into its feminine opposite. Aristotle’s quite brilliant solution to the problems presented by inherited  characteristics thus results in a profound incoherence in terms of his theory  of sexual reproduction, because it requires a balance of powers, δυνάμεις,  between the sexes that cannot be reduced to the matter–form distinction.  There is simply no explanation of how the “information” for the mother’s  form, the mother’s λόγος, can be present in the menstrual blood, even if this  has, as he says, the potential to become all the female parts as well as the  male parts. If the father’s δύναμις qua individual (rather than qua male) fails  to master the matter, how can the offspring resemble his or her mother? Aris- totle posits no λόγος deriving from the female. Are we then to just assume the  presence of the δύναμις or λόγος of the mother’s form, qua individual, as well  as those of her parents and other ancestors, in the menstrual fl uid? This is a  substance he has characterized, quite unusually and surprisingly, as πρώτη ύλη,  fi rst or prime matter, supremely passive and ready to be acted upon.37 Matter,  however, is found also to be the site of unexpected disruptions, transforma- tions, and potencies, of the spontaneity designated by αὐτόματον, the chance  occurrences of nature. In chapter Z.9 of the Metaphysics, Aristotle indeed pursues the analysis  in such a way that leads him to contradict almost everything he says about  matter elsewhere. He starts by asserting that in some instances a thing can  be generated both by αὐτόματον and by τέχνη, as in the case of health, which  may just be present by the chance element in nature, or be brought to pres- ence by the actions of a doctor. He says – using the middle voice – that in  such instances the matter is “such that it can be the source of its own motion  [οἵα κινεῖσθαι ὑφ’ αὑτῆς].”38 And this is a remarkable statement indeed.  However, Aristotle does not emphasize just how singular and complex the  notion of “health” is (as a context for these self-initiated motions), even  though it appears repeatedly in his discourses as a paradigmatic τέλος. For  health may be the end-product and aim of a τέχνη (medicine), but since the  “matter” upon which this τέχνη operates is a living body, it is quite unlike a  bed or a statue, and thus health also indicates that a body is by nature func- tioning well, living well, in accordance with its form or actuality, its ἐνεργεία.  We might say, then, that insofar as the body for the doctor is analogous to the  wood for the carpenter, the body is “matter,” but insofar as the body itself is  already a hylomorph, a composite of form and matter generated by nature,  it is not mere matter at all but a natural “this,” an organic unity, that can be  theoretically further decomposed into material components (fl esh and bone,  or menstrual blood, depending on whether it is analyzed it statically or geneti- cally) and form. But Aristotle does not claim this here at all. His statement is,  </page> <page sequence="11"> 148 emanuela bianchi rather, quite explicit: the matter in itself (not just qua the object at hand for  the doctor) is self-moving. Nevertheless, Aristotle simply treats health as an  example – as if there were many others – of things that are generated both  artifi cially and spontaneously, instead of the remarkable, mysterious, and per- haps unique confl uence of material necessity, bodily practices, and medical  art, of φύσις, ἔθος, and τέχνη, that it undoubtedly is. What follows is still more confusing. Things that have the capacity to move  themselves can be divided into two kinds: those that can move themselves  in a particular way (presumably animals), and those that cannot – he says,  “so as to dance [ὀρχήσασθαι].”39 Such dancing, in the middle voice, is a kind  of self-motion without form or end. It is presumably not choreographed or  orchestrated, but improvised, mantic, automatic. This matter that moves itself  in no particular way (οὐχ ὡδί), dancing in the middle voice, certainly suggests  Lucretius’s famous dust motes dancing in a sunbeam,40 but perhaps also the  Bacchanalian frenzy: the automatism of women dancing in the mountains, far  beyond the confi nes of the πόλις. Moving to a discussion of natural becoming and αὐτόματον as spontaneous  generation, Aristotle writes: But things by nature which are generated spontaneously [ταὐτομάτου]  are, as in the previous case, those whose matter can be moved also  by itself in the way in which it can be moved by the seed; but things  without this capability cannot be generated otherwise than by things  like themselves.41 Aristotle has just discussed how the seed acts just like things produced by  τέχνη, as the source of the seed has the same name (ὁμώνυμον) as the seed’s  product: a horse reproduces a horse. Likewise, the bed is built from the λόγος  or idea of the bed within the carpenter – the idea and the product have the  same name. He adds, though, that we must not expect to fi nd this homonymy  in every case in nature, since we say that a woman – if not a monster (ἐὰν μὴ  πήρωμα ᾖ) – is also produced by a man. Likewise, a mule does not come from  a mule.42 In other words the processes of generation in nature also dance, they  are subject to certain aleatory deviations, and in these cases what is produced  does not always have the same name as its progenitor – the mating of a horse  and a donkey produces something else, called a mule, and a man may likewise  produce a woman. Matter’s αὐτόματον breaks the homonymy of λόγος. These deviations, then, the articulating deviations of αὐτόματον, disrupt  the νόμος and λόγος of patrilineal and patronymic succession, the paternal  logic of the moving cause. Sexual reproduction is thus explicitly given the  same aetiology, the same causal explanation, as that of spontaneous genera- tion, in short that “matter has the power to move itself in the same way as  the seed.”43 The opaque motion of matter, its automatic spontaneity, is able  to intervene in and disrupt the passing down of the patronymic – breaking  the homonymy, forcing a shift in the λόγος – between one generation and the  </page> <page sequence="12">  aristotle’s organism, and ours 149 next. The αὐτόματον of matter thus articulates both beings and words through  time, in a randomly shifting series, in a form of change and temporality char- acterized by unpredictability, lability, deviation, and opacity. In the phenom- enon of αὐτόματον, where the aleatory motions of matter are exposed, we  may glimpse a moment of unorthodox Aristotelianism wherein Darwinism  is foreshadowed, insofar as automatism is the unthinking, uncaused, undi- rected, non-teleological engine for transformations of form over generations. By way of conclusion let me return to the conception of becoming from the  Physics – that of matter, privation, and form. Here matter is oriented in  advance toward its τέλος, and represents a hole or space yearning to be fi lled, a  hole that is only defi ned by the peg that will come to fi ll it, as the female desires  the male. Nevertheless, it is crucially important to recognize that as soon as  matter is understood as thus invaginated, as incorporating a penetrable priva- tion at its heart, such a determination by a τέλος in advance is displaced, and  an indeterminate fi eld of becoming is hence necessarily opened. Understand- ing matter as δύναμις shackles it necessarily to ἐνεργεία as the realization or  actualization of a potential for a specifi c form, but it is precisely as this site of  privation that matter enables becoming anything at all, not merely becoming  some determinate thing, predetermined by teleology. In its most radical dimen- sion, then, δύναμις as potential or capacity or possibility, as the condition for  possibility for becoming in general, must indicate an open fi eld of possibilities.  It is a delimited fi eld to be sure, for an elephant does not give birth to a mouse;  but within those limits – whatever they may be – the possibilities are theoreti- cally infi nite because infi nitesimally different. Aristotle falls just short of acknowledging the plural possibilities inherent  in matter, but it is worth recalling his defi nition of matter as “what is able to  both be and not be.”44 Matter thus defi ned appears as the very site of indeter- minacy and the aleatory, the site where A and not-A may both transpire. The  potentially infi nite fi eld of possibility that matter represents is instead reduced  to a simple opposition, the primary contrary of being or not-being. Yet as  evidenced by all the ways that nature does not go according to plan, through  chance, plural ἀρχαί, and the indeterminacy of matter, the restless rumbling of  plural possibilities may be discerned beyond and behind this congealed logical  formula of non-contradiction. The female offspring, after all, is not simply a  not-A, but rather an opposite or contrary in nature who bears the mark of pri- vation. And this contradiction is negotiated in her very body. Feminine matter  may be oriented toward and set along a proper path, but may also, teratologi- cally, go off the rails and in turn (in quite un-Aristotelian fashion) send form  itself off the rails, toward other as yet untold shapes and confi gurations. The  vicissitudes of the feminine symptom disclose here a radically non-Aristotelian  space or fi eld of contingent pluralities that signifi es an always present possibil- ity of other unforeseen kinds of becoming. Here, then, subterranean and suppressed forces, including environmental  factors and unpredictable material conditions, are irreducible, effective factors  </page> <page sequence="13"> 150 emanuela bianchi in the coming to be of the organism. We might thus discern, against all of  Aristotle’s explicit claims, resources in the Aristotelian text for a vision of the  organism not as the bounded, unifi ed totality of the one, but perhaps as devel- oping according to an entirely different topology and logic. In a feminist frame,  we might push for a conceptualization according to the Irigarayan topology of  the two lips, partly open in intimate proximity to itself and its surroundings,  or indeed as irreducibly plural.45 Or in terms of the leaky, open, penetrable,  fungible, and thus “horrifying” bodies of women investigated by feminist theo- rists such as Margrit Shildrick and Elizabeth Grosz.46 The ἐξίστασθαι, λύεσθαι,  and αὐτόματον, the destructions, slackenings, and compulsions inherent in the  materiality of sexual reproduction carry with them the signs of fi nitude and  mortality, of castration, monstrosity, disease and death – those dispersals and  divisions evident in Nietzsche’s Empedocleanism and in Bergson’s durée. The reading of Aristotle offered here, then, demonstrates that at least part  of the impetus for a vision of a totalized, cleanly separate, healthily functional,  fully hierarchized and stratifi ed organism is an anxious masculinity, eager to  inoculate itself from feminine threats of leaky boundaries and bodily dissolu- tion. This would seem to align quite neatly with the philosophical-political  critiques of the organism proffered above, stretching from Kant and Goethe  to Deleuze and Guattari. But what might we also make of the fl ight from the  organismic paradigm within the biological sciences over the last two centuries?  This fl ight, has, in fact, been quite hotly contested. A slew of early twentieth- century biologists in Germany, the UK, and the US including E. S. Russell,  W. E. Ritter, Kurt Goldstein, Agnes Arber, and J. H. Woodger have argued in  various registers for the organism’s centrality and coherence to the biological  sciences, borrowing largely from Kant a thinking of teleology and functional- ity that does not invoke “metaphysical” principles such as form, design, or  fi nal purpose secreted in Nature.47 Ritter, for instance, invokes the hormone  as a chemical secretion that affects the organism as a whole, not simply indi- vidual organs, and the massive uptake of this by the pharmaceutical industry  is indeed transforming our notions of sex and gender in radical fashion that  has been recently analyzed by Paul (Beatriz) Preciado along Foucauldian lines  as a neoliberal form of “pharmacopower.”48 While such power may work at  the microcapillary level, it is at the level of the whole organism that hormones  phenomenologically reveal their powerful effect. Goldstein’s work on brain- damaged patients reveals the organism’s plasticity, its negotiations with the  external world both as potentially catastrophic and as productive of its reality;  Catherine Malabou’s recent The Ontology of the Accident covers strikingly  similar ground.49  Today, indeed, biology struggles no less with the concept of organism  despite its various disciplinary dispersals into ecological, systematic, and molec- ular frameworks, as indicated by the topic addressed by a recent issue of the  journal Studies in the History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical  Sciences: “On Nature and Normativity: Normativity, teleology and mechanism  in biological explanation.”50 From a physical perspective, the organization of  </page> <page sequence="14">  aristotle’s organism, and ours 151 molecules into arrangements of increasing complexity seems to defy the second  law of thermodynamics, which states that things tend toward the lowest pos- sible states of energy: the disorganization and dispersals of entropy. Biologists  typically explain this by demonstrating that living cells give off maximally dis- ordered energy in the form of heat, thus offsetting the extra energy it takes for  there to be ordered complexity.51 But this still does not explain why the greater  complexity of the cycles of transformation that maintain life might emerge in  the fi rst place. Systems chemist Addy Pross has recently argued that, through  the concept of “dynamic kinetic stability” a second sort of stability exists in  nature that may be mathematically modeled: “Nature’s most fundamental  drive, dictated by logic itself, is toward greater stability. That drive has a ther- modynamic manifestation, as expressed through the ubiquitous Second Law,  but it also has a kinetic manifestation – the drive toward increasingly persistent  replicators.”52 There seems to me to be no great philosophical barrier to think- ing of such a drive along Deleuze-Guattarian lines as “desiring production.”53  And yet, despite political and scientifi c critiques of the organism, its func- tional system of parts and wholes, the way that it is both marked as and  functions as a primary signifi er of totality, hierarchy, substantiality, sovereign  power, and all the weight of stultifying metaphysics, the organism still imposes  itself upon us as a signifi cant entity. In this phenomenological register it also  surely appeared to Aristotle and Theophrastus, during the years when they  observed the life-cycles, the manifold structures, and behaviors of the small  strange creatures inhabiting a Lesbian lagoon. Might the organism thus carry  another kind of valence? One that disrupts and resists what is surely also a  neoliberal logic of fl exibility, the molecular fl ow of capitalist logic into every  minute of our day and into every pore of our bodies. Such fl ow is perfectly  exemplifi ed by the assaults on sleep through pharmacological and other tech- nical-productive means recently described by Jonathan Crary, insofar as sleep,  so necessary at the level of the organism, defi es imperatives of accelerating  capitalist production and consumption.54 Mauritzio Esposito, indeed, reads the  politics of the organism in a different frame, emphasizing that mechanistic and  reductionist approaches in biology support a capitalist ideology of competi- tion, and came to the fore most strongly during the Cold War period “in which  group confl ict and competition were seen as essential to a pluralistic democratic  society.” Organismic models, he argues, promote instead a view of society that  emphasizes harmony and cooperation.55 The temporality of the organism, the  rhythms it imposes, the zones of privacy upon which it can insist, may yet be a  site of resistance to the encroachments of neoliberal capitalism, a slowness that  insists upon its needs against capital’s ever increasing speeds. The Aristotelian organism, as I have articulated it, may be both the site of  resistance to invasive externalities, and also a site of endless agonism between a  logic of hierarchical function on the one hand and the destabilizations of alea- tory matter on the other. Aristotle’s concern with the non-human organism inev- itably opens on to an anthropomorphic concern with the human, that organism  whose characteristic functioning is not just a normative conception of health,  </page> <page sequence="15"> 152 emanuela bianchi but also living well as the ζῷον who possesses both λόγος and a political life. The  ἐνεργεία of the Aristotelian organism, then, might be understood not simply as  a static state of completion, but as a doing, a seeing or a thinking, the human  being in its full realization. The Nicomachean Ethics offers contemplation as  the highest form of human activity, that in which we most resemble the divine  νόησις νοήσεως, thought thinking itself, and this seems to confi rm the image of  the bounded, separate, autarchic, and fully self-suffi cient individual. And yet it is  also characteristic of humans to engage in the open-ended, indeterminate activi- ties of political life. In this ambivalence of closed and open system, it seems to  me that the agonisms and the harmonies indicated at the site of the Aristotelian  organism are perhaps inescapable and necessary, in the sense that the Lacanian  mirror-stage is a necessary, if truth-compromised, stage through which the infant  passes in its ontogenesis. For Lacan, the infant sees itself as a bounded totality  in the mirror for the fi rst time, and this vision of unity throws it into an unprec- edented state of disorder, the “fl utter of jubilant activity.”56 Its recognition of its  “unity” is in a profound sense a “misrecognition,” not only because the baby  does not have the motor skills to act in an orderly way, but also because the  organism is constantly in process, constantly realizing indeterminate potentials  that are both its own and not its own. But nonetheless, the “false” image that  it has formed of itself supports its growing sensation of unifi cation and contrib- utes actively to its integration as ontogenesis proceeds. The imaginary function  that “closes off” the organism is certainly supported and “supplemented” by  the ready hegemony of substantialist metaphysics and phantasies of sovereignty.  And yet a quick glance at the strange proliferations, the beings and becomings  found in oceans, lagoons, swamp, and soil may always have the power to carry  us away from the narcissistic mirror, and into the lap of the milieu with whose  fate our own is always inescapably entangled. notes [Though recontextualized and lightly edited, some passages in this chapter have  previously appeared in Emanuela Bianchi, The Feminine Symptom.

This evocation of the object cannot help resonating with the new status of  the object in currently emerging philosophies of object-oriented ontology  and speculative realism. While I cannot engage in any substantive way  with these movements within the scope of this essay, I do want to empha- size that Aristotle’s approach usefully reasserts the ontological primacy  of a distinction between technical and natural objects, one that is often  minimized in recent discussions of the object qua object. </page> <page sequence="16">  aristotle’s organism, and ours 153  3.

In fairness to Aristotle he does qualify this by noting  that femaleness and ugliness are “accidents” of subjects rather than sub- jects in themselves, but this does not obviate the force of the analogy. 29. Relevant instances of ῥοπή, often translated as impetus or impulse, occur  at Aristotle, De Caelo, II.1 297a28, b7, at III.2 310a22, at II.2 305a25,  and at IV.1 307b33.

Derrida attends to the many aleatory resonances of the notion of the fall –  befalling, crashing, letting the chips fall where they may – thus:  One can fall well or badly, have a lucky or unlucky break – but  always by dint of not having foreseen – of not having seen in  advance and ahead of oneself. In such a case, when man or  the subject falls, the fall affects his upright stance and vertical  position by engraving in him the detour of a clinamen, whose  effects are inescapable.

At 766b15–16 Aristotle says that “if [the male semen]  gains the mastery, it brings [the material] over to itself; but if it gets mas- tered, it changes over either into its opposite or else into extinction.” That  the continuous scale of temperature should manifest itself “necessarily” in  opposites, as manifested by male and female, is diffi cult to understand. The  necessity operating here becomes clearer if we recall Aristotle’s insistence  that all coming-to-be involves a diremption into active and passive compo- nents and thus in the case of sexual reproduction, into male and female. 35.
