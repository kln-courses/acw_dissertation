Demy 8vo. 1 vol. xii+ 284. 6s. net. Life in the Homeric Age is not merely a notable work-it may be in certain respects considered a great work. Yet I am afraid that I find it gravely disappointing. To take its strong points first, it is a work of vast and careful erudition, displaying an astonishing grasp of a very complicated subject, a concentrated enthusiasm for the Homeric poetry and the people depicted in it, and best of all a virile love of truth combined with a very mature judgment when deciding points of detail. Professor Seymour is not, I am glad to say, one of those who labour to deck out a favourite though impossible theory with garish and fantastic arguments. He is bent upon quiet and scientific enquiry into facts rather than upon the task of maintaining 'per fas et nefas' preconceived theories about the unity of the poems and the personality of their author. The weakness of Professor Seymour springs from quite another source. We might say indeed that it is a defect springing from that very cold scientific attitude which is ad- mirable enough in itself. He is so careless of theory that he forgets to co-ordinate NO. CXCVI. VOL. XXII. his facts, and after reading the book with a certain awe, one is inclined to sigh that so little comes of it. The author had a great opportunity, but has failed to make the most of it. If he merely intended to produce a sort of Homeric Encyclopedia, he has not failed-but is that wanted so badly that was worth what appears to be the devotion of a highly gifted life? There are many Homeric problems still to be attacked-and I regret to say I do not think Professor Seymour's book gives much direct help towards the solution of any one of them. If he had only a little more imagination-yes, he might have made mistakes-but even so he would certainly have advanced Homeric science more than he has even dreamed of doing. Nor is this defect of method due to the absence of a theory about the poems. In his introductory chapter-one of the most interesting to my mind in the whole book- the Professor lays down very clearly his position. He is convinced that the poems are the result of a gradual growth-he thinks that stubborn facts prove this-and indeed he goes so far as to say that their production may have been carried on for a period of three, or at least two, hundred years. This clear and unwarped vision of the essential character of the Homeric Corpus makes us feel great surprise that in dealing with the phenomena of Homeric life as revealed in the poetry, Professor Seymour sternly refuses to apply his knowledge of the truth. He persists continuously (except for a few foot- 0</page><page sequence="2">186 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW notes and occasional half-relevant ' obiter dicta') in treating of Homeric civilization as though it represented merely a single moment of Hellenic evolution, instead of a series of various stages-which may, it is true, have changed slowly (as he somewhere hints) but must have changed uninterruptedly. Instead of rudely pushing out of sight this principle of social growth, it should have been taken as the very groundwork of the discussion of Homeric life. The reader should never have been allowed to forget that in discussing Homeric life we are dealing with a period about which, if any single statement can be roundly made, it is that it was a period of transition and therefore of continuous change ! I will now illustrate my remarks by reference to detailed points of the Professor's treatment. Among the questions about the early age of Greece which have been successfully eluci- dated by Professor Ridgeway, that regarding the system of land-tenure' obtaining among the Homeric people is preeminent. In his article on the subject he explained several textual difficulties and gave a clear and consistent account of the whole land-system, basing his views on the existing evidence in the poems of the transition from the more primitive agrarian stage in which land is held in common to a more advanced system which obtains as the idea of private and personal property becomes evolved more definitely. It is quite apparent that Seymour knows of the article in question, for he quotes from it in a small-print footnote, and evidently Ridgeway's views meet with his approval substantially. But his own method not taking account of progressive states but merely of isolated statements, he has to content himself in this context with the remark that 'the contention that the land in Greece was not held in severalty by common men does not seem to have been proved' ;2 and during a long and learned discussion of the whole subject extending over about 20 pages, there is not so much as a hint that the references he gives to the Homeric text need not necessarily belong to a single stage, but to widely different stages, of social and agrarian evolution. Such a method of dealing with a complicated question cannot boast of finality, and is not even, apart from other merits, of much practical service. We may now turn to another question about which much more has been written of recent years, and show that Seymour's treat- ment of it reveals the same defect of method. This is the question of the structure of the Homeric House considered both in relation to the Homeric literature and to the pre- historic archaeology of Greece. Here indeed the Professor is at his best, and in ap- proaching this question he lays down a principle which has hitherto hardly received adequate recognition, and which indeed might have reminded him (for a convinced evolutionist as he professes himself to be) that he is losing sight of an essential con- dition of the problem he is attacking. In dealing with the monuments he reminds us that they exist in sites which are widely apart in space, instancing 'Troy, Mycenae, Tiryns, Cnossus and Phaestus, not to mention Phylakopi and Gournia.'3 And he asks very pertinently why-since the palaces are not all built on a common plan, even though they may have certain features in common- should we assume that the Homeric poet only knew of a single type without even important structural modifications? This is most obvious, but is it not an equally obvious caution that we ought not to assume that all the notices in Homer bearing on domestic architecture belong invariably to a single epoch and a single moment of the art of building? I do not say it is impossible -though to me personally the presumption is against it-I merely say that a method of enquiry which omits to raise such a question cannot be wholly satisfactory. When dealing with probabilities, your conclusion can at best be only probable; but it will not even be that if you eliminate from your premisses a probable principle of importance. The chapters on Religion, xiv. to xvi., will be undoubtedly the most interesting both to the student of Homer and to the general reader. They are extremely well done, so far as they go, that is they display 1 The Homeric Land System. J. H.

But here above all we seem to feel the want of a more truly scientific handling of the facts-meaning by science not the bare and dry induction of the observer, but that higher faculty of intuition on which the progress of all science ultimately depends. And if Professor Seymour had braced himself to the task of enquiring into the fundamental relation of the Olympian religion to the more primitive and darker cults which it sup- planted, even without going beyond the data supplied by the Homeric text, his extra- ordinary knowledge of that text combined with his gift of calm judgment would have been turned to good account. He does indeed throw light on the views expressed by Homer on the after-world, though perhaps he is inclined to take the words of the text too literally as when he refuses to see anything modern in the words of Zeus to Hera, saying that even though she should go to Tartarus he recketh not. 'To say that she may go there is very different from bidding her go thither.'" Well-perhaps ? But if I began to discuss Professor Seymour in detail as a reviewer does ordin- arily, where or when should I end ? I will rather satisfy myself with the somewhat general criticism I have already given. If however, in regard to my views, it be objected that the writer did not propose to himself to do more than he has done, did not wish to obscure the light of truth by the shadows of conjecture, I reply that it is precisely because of his rare qualities of restraint and mental balance that we feel the want of a little more boldness of method, which would have added to the lasting value of his work, high though we believe that value to be. It may be that Life in the Homeric Age is merely intended by its learned author as a sort of preliminary study for a higher and more ambitious effort; and we truly hope it may be so, even though it will show that our criticism is comparatively speaking un- founded. But in such a case, might we not plead in our defence that on the pre- supposition that evolution is to be left out of the question, we were justified in assuming that the book before us is to be taken merely as it stands? Seriously, however, we hope that Professor Seymour has not said his last word on Homeric Life.2 We now turn with pleasure to consider a work of quite opposite tendency, the Harvard Lectures of Mr. Gilbert Murray on 'The Rise of the Greek Epic.' If I am not much deceived, this book, the appearance of which is most timely, will be found to have left a permanent mark upon the ideas of English- speaking peoples about Homer. It combines very considerable scholarship with an unusual degree of literary insight and breadth of treatment. In reading these interesting and stimulating essays, one is conscious that the author writes because he really has something to say about the poems; that he has read them to some purpose, and has felt and almost seen as he read. He does not strike us, any more than did Professor Seymour, as one who is wedded to preconceived views about Homer, and as he frankly tells us in his preface, he does not aim strictly at being original in the sense of formulating any new theory or view. Yet his book is original in the highest sense, because it is really fresh and personal and sanely imaginative. That the poems are the result of a long process of growth, Mr. Murray (like Professor Seymour) simply takes for granted. I mean that, while he is evidently willing that all he has to say about the Rise of the Greek Epic should tend to confirm the evolutionary view, he does not think it worth while to labour at a demonstration of the obvious. He says,8 for instance, 'We judge by wrong standards when we apply to a traditional poem the creation of whole generations of men, poets and hearers, working through many ages, canons which only apply to the works to which we are accustomed in modern litera- ture.' And again, and this is an important passage,4 'The intensity of imagination which makes the Iliad alive is not, it seems to me, the imagination of any one man. It means 2 The readers of the C.R. are aware that the realization of the above wish is no longer possible. As it was written before the Professor's lamented death, it is allowed to remain unaltered.

It means that generation after generation of poets, trained in the same schools and a more or less continuous and similar life, steeped them- selves to the lips in the spirit of this great poetry.' We have here felicitously expressed (and at greater length in the context) what many writers on the Homeric question have probably believed to be true, though I doubt if the view has been previously formulated quite so expressly and forcibly. There are so many really brilliant passages, in the Lectures, as those who are acquainted with Mr. Murray's style would expect, that it is difficult to give a good idea of the book when treating it piecemeal. But one of the contributions which it brings to Homeric science seems to me to stand out very clearly beyond the rest, and to call for special reference in a review. I mean his treatment of the Principle of Expurgation as applied to the poems. I more gladly deal with this question because it illustrates what I have touched upon in the earlier part of this article, namely the importance of using the scientific imagination in criticism even where it may be the occasion of some accidental errors. For although I have grave misgivings about Mr. Murray's expurgation theory as he applies it, yet I feel no doubt that by raising the question he has earned the best thanks of serious students of Homer. His argument is chiefly based on analogy, which is perhaps a special reason for viewing it with a certain distrust. He finds in the Semitic records, especially in the Hebrew Scriptures, clear indications of a progressive tendency to suppress or to distort phrases or facts which are thought by the writers to be objectionable on various grounds. Arguing from these premisses, Mr. Murray accounts by a long and gradual process of elimination for many of the familiar features of the Homeric poems, in particular for their tone of simple manly purity, and for their comparative absence of allusion to the darker forms of religious beliefs and ritual which we may suppose to have been prevalent among the early Greeks. While then welcoming this theory as one really calculated to throw light on the poems from many points of view, I would suggest that it ought to undergo a very careful scrutiny before it is to be admitted and unreservedly applied to Homer. In the first place Mr. Murray's analogies are taken not from the poetical books of the Old Testament, such as the Davidic psalms or the Sapiential writings, but chiefly from the Pentateuch, which professes to be merely historical, and is entirely wanting in organic unity or literary form. Of course it might possibly be argued that poems lend them- selves more readily than prose writings to changes like those contemplated in the 'Expurgation' theory-nor shall I deny that this argument would have some plausibility. I would merely suggest that the cases under consideration are not nearly so similar as Mr. Murray's argument clearly assumes them to be. Moreover, when viewing the question chiefly as one of analogy, it is to my mind a matter of fair debate whether the expurgatorial influence ought to be as readily admitted in the case of popular poetry as in that of dry historical narrative. It would be impossible within our limits to discuss this very interesting theory in fuller detail; but there is another caution I must enter against the writer's treatment of his theory or rather against a particular application of it. I refer to his essay on the Homeric religion after it has been, as he supposes, subjected to the 'purging' process. I am quite sure that there is much that is reasonable as well as stimulating in his remarks about the Olympian cults as reflected in the poems; but in carrying on his argu- ment, it appears as though he has allowed himself to be carried away and to express himself in somewhat exaggerated terms. I do not find that he sufficiently distinguishes between what I may call substantial Homeric belief and its poetic presentation by the Homeric bards. It is indeed quite possible that he has succumbed to the fascination of Miss Harrison's style when she talks about the 'played-out puppets' of the Olympian hierarchy. I had better quote, though a short extract will of course only inadequately represent Mr. Murray's ideas. He says,1 'This scientific and critical temperament among the people of Ionia was 1pp. 235.6 (the italics are again ours).</page><page sequence="5">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 189 met by a special weakness in the Homeric religion. It was not really rehlgion at all. The twelve Olympians whom we find in Homer forming a sort of divine family, and whom we know from statues, do not repre- sent the gods worshipped by any particular part of Early Greece. They represent an enlightened compromise made to suit the conveniences of a federation. Every local god had been shorn of his mystical and monstrous characteristics . . these things were cleared away from Homer's world or else humanized and made to tone in with his general serene anthropomorphism. This anthropomorphism happened to suit the art of sculpture, which became highly important in Greece, and for that reason among others the Homeric gods have dominated the later tradition.' And then he goes on to show that Zeus was less worshipped at Athens (in the later period) than Poseidon and Athena; and that the latter was in reality not so much the Olympian Athena, as a native earth- maiden of Pelasgian origin. Now all these statements taken severally are, let us grant, undeniable; and yet I think a small amount of consideration will show that they have been so strung together as to produce a too heightened impression as to the deficiency of the Homeric religion. For such references to post-Homeric de- velopments, however interesting to the student of Greek religion in general, cannot really explain the minds of the early bards. And we ourselves, being accustomed to think of the Frieze and Pediments of the Parthenon in their relation to the Homeric faith, are perhaps apt to forget that, however much Pheidias may have been under the spell of the bards, yet they were strangers to his marbles. Carrying on his argument that the anthropomorphic conceptions of divinity expressed in the poems could not really have had a truly religious significance for their authors, our writer has collected a number of more or less unseemly and mocking references to the gods and god desses of Olympus in the older poem. He leaves Demodocus alone because he appears in the Odyssey, but he deals at length with the ~Epo yptos of Zeus, and of course with the more absurd aspects of the OEopaXla. No one would deny that there is plenty of irreverence in Homer, nor can we justly deny him the attribute of humour, though I must frankly admit (and here I am sorry to be at issue with my friend Professor Henry on the Doloneia) much that is often thought to be conscious parody I would attribute to the sorry attempts of the rhapsodes of the decadence to imitate what was above their capacity. But all this is only half the story. It seems to me the other half has been passed over too lightly in the Rise of the Greek Epic. The conception of Apollo ' Who went like to the Night' has nothing funny about it. And anyone who comes to the 'limping Hephaestus' after reading the First Iliad will I think view him far otherwise than if he reads about him for the first time in the context, now provided for him. I find no lack of religion any more than of poetry in the relation of Achilles to Thetis, .of Odysseus to Athena, or even of Sarpedon to Zeus. Only we must always remember that it is poetry first and foremost, and religion in the second place. And I think it is one thing to ask what people believe and another to ask how they will express their belief through a given artistic medium. We need not go to Gothic cathedrals to learn that lesson-for Dante and Milton will teach it to us. If they were subjected to Mr. Murray's method of criticism I am not sure that either of them would emerge from the trial unscathed, and yet one of them was as devout a Catholic as the other was a convinced Puritan. I would not be mis- understood. Mr. Murray's strictures on the Olympianism of Homer refer in great measure to the end of the Homeric period, and if restricted to that there certainly would be no quarrel between us. My criticism is indeed offered from a most sympathetic standpoint, but I do think, in his anxiety to illustrate the principle of development which began with expurgation and ended in de- terioration, he has allowed himself to some- what obscure the higher side of the Homeric anthropomorphism. And I agree so strongly with his opinions in general, that I view with regret a seeming tendency to exaggerate on such an important point. HENRY BROWNE.</page></plain_text>
