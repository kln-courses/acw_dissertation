The book's contents are divided into an introduction and two parts. The introduction, "Prolegomenon to the Study of Medieval Chinese Buddhist Literature" (pp. 1-27), addresses problems associated with the modern study of Chinese Buddhism in an attempt to avoid faulty assumptions and place the discipline on a sounder theo retical footing. Part 1, "The Historical and Cosmological Background,” is divided into two chapters, "The Date and Provenance of the Treasure Store Treatise’’ (pp. 31-76) and "Chinese Buddhism and the Cosmology of Sympathetic Resonance” (pp. 77-133)- Part 2, "Annotated Translation of the Treasure Store Treatise" is di vided into an "Introduction to the Translation" (pp. 137-142) and the three chap ters of the Treasure Store Treatise text: "Chapter One: The Broad Illumination of Emptiness and Being" (pp. 143-192), "Chapter Two: The Essential Purity of Tran scendence and Subtlety" (pp. 193-227)，and "Chapter Three: The Empty Mystery of the Point of Genesis" (pp. 228-261). In addition, there are two appendixes: "On Esoteric Buddhism in China” (pp. 263-278) and "Scriptural Quotations in the Treasure Store Treatise” (pp. 279-286). Other sections are devoted to "Notes" (pp. 287-344), "Works Cited” (pp. 345-378), and an "Index" (pp. 379-400). "Acknowl edgments" (pp. ix-x), "Abbreviations" (p. x), and "Conventions of Usage” (pp. xii-xiii) are also provided. One can only applaud Sharf s attempt to reframe the study of Chinese Bud dhism in the book's introduction, "Prolegomenon to the Study of Medieval Chi nese Buddhist Literature.” While the argument put forth is not as provocative now as it would have been ten years ago when he first formulated it in the Ph.D. dissertation upon which the book is based, it is nonetheless cogent and timely. I begin this review with a brief overview of Sharf s position, as it is likely the part of the book that will have the widest appeal. As stated at the outset, "The modern study of medieval Chinese religion has been divided broadly between two camps: the sinologists and the buddhologists. While the former ignored Buddhism, the latter tended to ignore everything but” (p. 1). Moreover, the study of Buddhism in China was guided by essentialist as sumptions that divided religious traditions (Confucianism, Taoism, and Bud dhism) into a set of normative teachings, and subdivided them further into sects,</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 535 schools, and lineages. Like pieces on a religious chess board, these discrete ele ments were juxtaposed in relation to each other to represent a design of the reli gious terrain. Sharf finds two main problems with this approach. On the one hand, it is a representation superimposed after the fact: the construction of China's discrete traditions is almost exclusively the handiwork of later revision ists, who wove pieces of an earlier fabric to create a design largely of their own making. In short, it conveniently ignores the actual context, filled with the messy realities of political and social context and the real-life aspirations of a living congregation, to create "high religion” (a term used by Sharf on p. 4), that is, tra ditions comprised of a normative set of principles, doctrines, practices, et cetera, presumed to be universally valid. Sharf contends that the presumptions of nor mative traditions are inadequate for understanding what is actually happening on the ground (what Sharf calls “low” traditions), ultimately denigrating or dismiss ing whatever does not match the prescriptive standards of this approach. This leads to Sharf s second objection against essentialist approaches: they idealize a hypothetically “pure，” universal teaching against which all else is judged. Never mind that there is no way to validate whose interpretation of the teaching is "correct,M or that the very attempt to posit such a teaching is the prod uct of its own particular set of assumptions. Based on these criteria, Chinese Bud dhism itself has often been approached by buddhologists as a kind of bastard child that did not fulfill the modern presumptions of its "pure" Indian progenitor (as if the Indian Buddhist tradition was somehow immune to the forces of "low" traditions that Sharf himself observes: "Indian Buddhism is beginning to look more like a “religion’’ and less like the atheistic, rational, and humanistic creed that apologists are sometime disposed to discover in the canon”）. Even the very model of sinification，the standard framework into which studies on Chinese Buddhism are set, is highly suspect, according to Sharf, dependent as it is on “[t] he reified entities that loom largest in the master narrative ... [:] "Indian Bud dhism" and "Chinese culture” (p. 10). If old models are flawed, how can we best approach the subject? While cogni zant of the shortcomings that have characterized studies in the field, Sharf can of fer "no ready alternative to the prevailing paradigms for modeling sinification. The complexity of the linguistic, social, institutional, and conceptual interactions between culturally and linguistically diverse peoples spread over a vast region and lasting over many centuries thwarts the desire for a single comprehensive ac count" (p. 24). Sharf prudently offers that "[s]cholars are obliged to aver to some synoptic categories, overarching narratives, salient metaphors and analogies, lest we abrogate altogether our responsibility to render the past meaningful” {ibid.; italics in the original). Complexity cannot be understood without some sort of schema. The challenge, according to Sharf, is to remain cognizant of "the provi sional and heuristic nature of biological taxonomies, revising as one goes" (p. 25).</page><page sequence="3">536 China Review International: Vol. 9, No. 2, Fall 2002 Readers will judge for themselves the success of this strategy, which Sharf ex ecutes adroitly in the subsequent chapters. No one will fault the scholarly acumen that Sharf brings to the numerous topics he confronts. No stone seems to have been left unturned in the massive, if at time laborious, marshaling of materials. Many of the subjects dealt with—the five phases (ww-fcsmgSfT), sympathetic re sponse (kan-ying感應)，rite and ritual, the sage, matching concepts (ko-i 格義）， the doctrine of multiple buddha-bodies, and so on一are familiar ones, but Sharf manages to breathe new life into them at almost every turn, challenging common preconceptions and providing layers of nuance for what might have seemed a solid edifice. To my mind, the success and potential weakness of the book are attributable to this same methodology. Despite the mining of rich veins of material and the meticulous tracing of terms and concepts through an exhaustive variety of sources, some will miss the fact that greater resort was not made to an overarch ing narrative that would have rendered the plethora of materials even more meaningful. Recent critical theory has made all of us, including Sharf, wary of the pitfalls of grand narratives that reduce figures and phenomena to outside criteria. But, as Sharf admits, it is an abrogation of responsibility at some level not to in dulge in the narrative-making process. To err is human; likewise, it seems inevi table for us to attempt to create meaningful narrative structures. The task, then, is for us to provide more accurate narratives, revising or abandoning old models, rather than eschew narrative completely (as if that were possible in any case). To his credit, Sharf does provide the basis for a new narrative structure to re place old explanations regarding the composition and content of the Treasure Store Treatise (Pao-tsang lun 寶藏論).The attribution of the text to Seng-chao 僧 輩(374-414) is exposed as a strategy aimed at bolstering its credibility perhaps as late as the 820s (p. 36), and it is probable that the text was actually composed in the late eighth century, amidst a background of Ch'an and Twofold Mystery Tao ism (ch'ung-hstian 崇玄)discourse. Particularly noted are the stylistic similarities between the Chiieh-kuan lun 絕觀論，a text associated with the Ox Head Ch'an lineage, and the Treasure Store Treatise (pp. 40-47). The Treatise also shares ter minology and allusions common to a tradition known as Twofold Mystery Tao ism that supposedly flourished in the first half of the Tang dynasty but was not formally acknowledged until the tenth century by the Taoist exegete Tu Kuang t'ing 杜光庭（850-933) (pp. 52-61). What propelled Twofold Mystery Taoism, ac cording to Sharf, was a concerted effort to forge a "gentry Taoism" that could compete with Buddhism. Sharf goes to great lengths, in what I found to be one of the most interesting sections of the book, to show how the background of impe rial support for Taoism in the T'ang created an atmosphere of acceptance among this gentry Taoism for the kind of discussion that the Treatise employed, blending Buddhist, Taoist, and other Chinese cultural themes and concepts into a seamless</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 537 whole, as if these were part of a shared tradition rather than discrete teachings (pp. 71-76). The Treatise，in effect, represents a Buddhist counterresponse to the Twofold Mystery-type Taoism that appealed to the Taoist gentry, to win them over, it seems, with terms to which they could readily assent. Chapter 2 provides an in-depth exploration of the meaning-structure that in forms the Treasure Store Treatise, the cosmology of sympathetic resonance. The chapter suggests an alternative context for understanding Chinese Buddhist texts and doctrines by redirecting attention to the "ubiquitous and persistent influence of native Chinese cosmology" (p. 132). Examined here are such things as the cos mological, anthropomorphic versus naturalistic/mechanistic interpretation, and ritualistic aspects of sympathetic resonance. The notion of sympathetic reso nance itself is deceptively simple: objects belonging to the same category resonate spontaneously with each other just like two identically tuned strings on a pair of zithers (p. 83). What Sharf is most interested in is exploring how sympathetic re sonance is exhibited in the Chinese sage-king ideal of classical literature (pp. 90 93) and in popular religious tracts or tales of miraculous retribution (pp. 93-95). This Chinese background to the notion of sympathetic resonance is then dis cussed in terms of the influence it had on the Chinese understanding of the "reso nant-body" or “response-body” (ying-shen 應身）of a buddha: "The Chinese un derstanding of ying-shen. • • loosely incorporates (1) the Buddhist notion of a corporeal (or seemingly corporeal) body manifest in response to the needs of suf fering beings and (2) Chinese cosmological principles that explain the power to produce such bodies in terms of nonaction and sympathetic resonance" (p. 111). In the Chinese understanding, the sage, the bodhisattva, and the buddha be come intertwined through the principle of nonaction, becoming "at one with the universe," acquiring "attributes of stillness and harmonious balance,” responding spontaneously to the external stimuli of the world, "manifesting bodies wherever and whenever the need arises”（p. 112). In sinitic understanding, the Buddhist sage, “in other words, represents a synthesis of early Chinese models of the sage king and the Indian conception of bodhi as freedom from karmic activity" (p. 112). Following this are sections discussing how invocation and practices aimed at conjuring buddhas fit into the cosmology of sympathetic resonance as under stood in the Chinese Buddhist context. Part 1 serves as a prelude to Part 2, the "Annotated Translation of the Trea sure Store Treatise•” Armed with the information provided, Sharf aims to “show that the diverse and seemingly disconnected philosophical strands that run through the text can be rendered commensurate when placed within the context of native Chinese thought in general and sympathetic resonance in particular" (p. 132-133). Instead of a mishmash of Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist ideas, the workings of an undisciplined rogue, "the text turns out to be a coherent, some times elegant, and compendious presentation of the particular brand of eighth</page><page sequence="5">538 China Review International: Vol. 9, No. 2, Fall 2002 century Buddhist thought that came to be identified with Ch'an" (p. 133). The translation is heavily annotated and contains extensive commentary. Following a style common in modern Japanese translations of classical texts, Sharf breaks the text into segments (featured in bold print). Following each segment are com ments and annotation, sometimes running several pages. While this may be ad vantageous for studying the text, it makes for difficult reading. I would have pre ferred a more conventional approach that keeps the commentary with the translation but separates the notes (preferably at the bottom of the page, where they would be easily accessible). This may, however, be something of a moot point. This is a text whose contents can be rendered comprehensible only through study of the kind that Sharf s notes and commentary, not to mention the background material in Part 1，provide. This book provides a sound orientation to future studies in the field. It dem onstrates the maturity that the study of Chinese Buddhism has reached. Students and scholars will do well to heed the insights offered in this fine work.
