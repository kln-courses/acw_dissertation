<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph McMinn 'Ah, This Plethora of Metaphors! I am Like Everything Except Myself': The Art of Analogy in Banville's Fiction In an earlier study of Banville, I declared him to be a 'poetic novelist', in whose writings 'metaphor is supreme'.1 Looking back at that study now, I feel that it never really illustrated, even when it tried to explain, what these phrases implied. As in other accounts of Banville's fiction, my own dealt quite extensively with allusions and references to poets who are clearly admired by Banville, notably Wallace Stevens and Rainer Maria Rilke, whose versions of imaginative yearning are extensively visible and audible in the novels.2 In what follows I would like to illustrate Banville's use of analogies, especially those of simile and metaphor, and explore recurrent patterns of these tropes over the full range of the novels. I trust that this will become more than a trainspotting exercise, which simply lists and classifies dominant figures in the stories. The obsessive and elaborate use of analogy in these stories also raises questions about the nature of the narrators' minds, and about the ways in which experience and memory are understood and communicated. Analogy in Banville is not so much a stylistic choice or preference, but a necessary and vital perspective, the only way of rendering what memory recalls and what imagination creates. One of the most distinctive metaphorical conceits within Banville's fiction is that quizzical, troubled, and fascinated sense of the outer world having a life and character independent of the inner world of the narrator. Very often, this envious and admiring regard for the world outside the self, the world of nature or even that of inanimate objects, suggests that the outer, sensuous world has even more life and soul than anything possessed by the observer. Banville's narrators share this imaginative proclivity of attributing greater humanity to nature than they do to themselves, and are quite aware of the sadness which underlies this irony. For the narrators, everything outside them is animated, bewilderingly and beautifully alive and vital, all the while mocking the individual's effort to match this seeming intensity of being. This 'pathetic fallacy' is fundamental to the metaphoric imagination in Banville's fiction. Two of Banville's narrators make explicit this sense of a damaged romanticism in relation to nature ? in Athena, Morrow confesses that he has 'always lived in the midst of a pathetic fallacy', while Victor 134</page><page sequence="2">THE ART OF ANALOGY IN BANVILLE'S FICTION Maskell in The Untouchable repeats the same idea, admitting that he has 'always been prone to the pathetic fallacy'. Like so many terms of cultural criticism, this phrase, 'pathetic fallacy', was originally intended as a term of abuse, an expression of contempt for self-indulgent emotionalism. It was coined by the Victorian art-critic, John Ruskin, in his attack on the emotional incontinence of a certain kind of Romantic poetry.3 While he could appreciate and admire a history of analogy in world literature whereby human form and emotion were attributed to nature, as if the inanimate world had the emotional range and potential of a person, he deplored the solipsistic and sentimental use of the figure, especially when it only served to expose the lack of ideas or intellectual self-discipline in the writer. He could only understand this emotional self-indulgence as the sorry consequence of what he called 'reason unhinged by grief. The worst kind of Romantic writer, according to Ruskin, anthropomorphizes nature in a completely irrational way, confusing the human with the natural, strong emotion with reasoned feeling. The excessive use of metaphor was, for him, a tell-tale sign of this derangement of the senses, a flight into poetical fantasy away from a rational perspective upon nature, one which respected the difference between the contemplative mind and the independent world. In many ways, Ruskin's wholly negative account of the 'pathetic fallacy' is a most illuminating introduction to Banville's enthusiastic adoption of this seeming delusion. Everything that the rationalistic Ruskin deplored about Romanticism provides a most suggestive clue to Banville's version of postmodern fiction. Victor Maskell, for example, suffers again and again from the feeling that, having misplaced his faith in academic scholarship, he has probably lost his original passion, ending up as what he calls 'a spoiled romantic'. If there is a strong element of Romanticism in Banville's fiction, then it lies in this context of a struggle between the heart and the mind, the body and soul, as it does in the earliest fictions which make up the scientific tetralogy, as it continues through the Frames trilogy, and in new, less obvious, forms thereafter. The pathetic fallacy is central to the design of Birchwood, the first tale by Banville whose style is relentlessly figurative. At the end of that novel, Gabriel Godkin records his startled, envious fascination with 'the harmony of the seasons', sensing therein a coherence missing from his own life. The precise, extraordinary timing of Spring's arrival ? 'St Brigid's day, right on time' ? becomes a motif in virtually everything written by Banville afterwards, especially towards the conclusion of narratives, with nearly all the narrators responding to this essential myth of inexorable seasonal advance, in emotional terms which range between delight and fear, awe and anxiety. In Doctor Copernicus, for 135</page><page sequence="3">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW example, Rheticus repeatedly sings his own hymn of joy to the seasons, convinced that Copernicus failed in his project to displace human emotion from the centre of the sensuous universe: Beloved Earth! he banished you forever into darkness. And yet, what does it matter? The sky shall be forever blue, and the earth shall forever blossom in spring, and this planet shall forever be the centre of all we know. I believe it.4 The fact that Rheticus eventually drifts into sentimental madness, while repeating this refrain, should probably make us somewhat sceptical of his credentials as a reliable messenger of Romantic truths. And yet this sensuous and rhetorical attraction ? or revulsion ? towards nature's vital progress remains a distinctive part of the narrative reflections within the novels. In The Book of Evidence, even Freddie Montgomery senses the qualitative difference in the atmosphere of the prison, once Spring arrives, which he describes as 'the quickening in the air', while Victor Maskell dislikes the season of renewed fertility, 'Too disturbing, too distressing, all this new life blindly astir'. None of this is to suggest that the Banvillean narrator is usually a nature-worshipper, or a defective one, whose final vision of things, human and natural, is somehow crystallized by a respectful and often reverential regard for nature. The narrator is usually too weird, too darkly sceptical for such a naive version of the sentimental idealism suggested by the 'pathetic fallacy' which so offended Ruskin. However, nature provides most of the figurative energy in Banville's fiction, from the overwhelming sense of landscapes as vital phenomena, to the external world as a reality best appreciated and conveyed through simile and metaphor. Since most of Banville's novels have a memorial design, then they are also about the way nature and the self are recalled and then translated into a fiction. The eponymous Kepler is one of Banville's earliest figures to be possessed of a sensibility and imagination which nearly always render nature in terms of a metaphorical character, emphasizing a sense of wonder and astonishment at the harmony of the natural world: He gained the common. The evening rested here, bronzed and quietly breathing, basking like an exhausted acrobat in the afterglow of marvellous exploits of light and weather. The elm tree hung intent above its own reflection in the pond, majestically hstening.5 The irony of this version of the pathetic fallacy is that it can only praise nature in anthropomorphic terms. For all the alienation and estrangement from nature felt by Banville's 'high, cold heroes', they 136</page><page sequence="4">THE ART OF ANALOGY IN BANVILLE'S FICTION cannot imagine or present it in its own terms, but need to see it as a reflection of human design. Like a latter-day Pygmalion, Banville is always trying to breath life into inanimate objects, making them an extension of his narrators' imagination. There is also a certain pleasure taken by the author, or narrator, in the figurative elaboration of this hallucinatory sense of being constantly observed by nature, as we see so often with Freddie Montgomery: Out of doors my spirits rose somewhat. How soft the air of summer here. I had been too long under harsh southern skies. And the trees, the great trees! those patient, quietly suffering creatures, standing stock-still as if in embarrassment, their tragic gazes somehow turned away from me.6 Banville's distinctive version of the pathetic fallacy is seen here in the attribution of greater sensitivity and delicacy to nature than to those who observe her. We should also note that Freddie's imagination, if not his sensitivity, is powerfully fuelled by gin; the same is true of the intoxicated, stuporous perspective on nature shown by many subsequent narrators, giving us the comic type of a drunk in Arcadia. Even within doors, Banville's characters are always alert to the life of interiors and objects, as if they are constantly being watched and followed by invisible eyes. In Ghosts, for example, the nameless narrator talks of the house on the island 'stirring out of a long slumber' after the winter, and exercising its creaky joints now that Spring has arrived. He also has a strange, paranoid sense of the house living in and around him, as well as the more usual sense of proprietary being. Soon he comes to believe that the house watches his every move: I had the impression of a certain disdain, of everything leaning carefully away from me with averted gaze. The house especially had a frowning, tight lipped aspect. Or perhaps I am wrong, perhaps what I detected was not contempt, or even disapproval, but something quite other: tactfulness, for instance ? inanimate objects seem ever anxious not to intrude ? or just a general wish to preserve the forms. Yet wherever I went, even when I walked into an empty room, I had an uncanny sense of things having fallen silent at my approach.7 There is a calculated 'Gothic' strain to these kinds of reflections, the sense of living in a haunted place, being observed by the ghosts of the past. Worse than being observed, however, is being studiously ignored by nature. If the world plays games with the narrators' sense of being and knowing, it can also imitate to perfection its absolute indifference 137</page><page sequence="5">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW to a character's existence. Max Morden, for example, in The Sea, marvels at what he calls 'the cruel complacency of ordinary things', and thinks he understands the sadistic calm of a world which observes human grief and disorder. Banville's version of the pathetic fallacy has contrived, through elaborate and ingenious analogies, to raise important questions about knowledge and faith. This is, after all, an agnostic fiction in search of an authentic alternative to a belief in a divinely arranged natural order. If, as Georg Lukacs once argued, the modern novel is 'the epic of a world that has been abandoned by God', then, as John Kenny now argues, Banville's work is perhaps best understood as central to that quest for an alternative faith in art itself as some form of modern consolation.8 One of nature's most important roles in this fiction is to remind humankind of its inconsequence. As early as Nightspawn, Banville's first novel, the narrator laments what he calls the world's 'contemptuous silence' in the face of human longing and desire. Sometimes the stories conjure up this effect through graphic, often violent dramas in the external world whose unpredictability petrifies their near-victims. Freddie Montgomery, for example, remembers a March day in his childhood, 'one of those blustery, Dutch days with china-blue sky and tumbling, cindery clouds', when he narrowly avoided being killed by a huge branch blown down by the gale-force wind. In what might be read as a parody of Wordsworthian recall, he remembers how his ego was more stunned than his heart, 'at how little my presence had mattered'. The rhythm of the natural order does not hesitate for an instant just because a child has luckily escaped death: nature may have feelings, but compassion is not one of them. In Ghosts, the narrator reflects upon his own feelings for nature, and nature's lack of interest in them: I have never been one to worship nature, yet I recognise a certain therapeutic value in the contemplation of natural phenomena; I believe it has to do with the world's indifference, I mean the way the world does not care about us, about our happiness, or how we suffer, the way it just bides there with uplifted glance, murmuring to itself in a language we shall never understand. Even such a one as I might learn humility from that unfailing example of endurance and small expectations. Nothing surprises nature; terrible deeds, the most appalling crimes, leave the world unmoved, as I can attest (p.65). Here we can detect a sad paradox which reveals itself to the character ? that nature enjoys the kind of stoicism which humanity would like to possess. Banville's fiction often suggests, in sympathetic fashion, 138</page><page sequence="6">THE ART OF ANALOGY IN BANVILLE'S FICTION that the attribution of feelings and personality to human beings is probably misplaced, and that the world of nature, as presented through art, is the real home of refined emotion. The richest image of nature in Banville's writing is that of the sea, with its many cognate forms and possibilities, and its historical links with mythical and legendary dramas. A fearful fascination with the sea is epitomized in the following passage from Eclipse, where the narrator, Alexander Cleave, takes a walk, 'like a medieval explorer about to take ship for Cathay', in order to contemplate the sea-shore near his home: Why do I find the thought of the sea so alarming? We speak of its power and violence as if it were a species of wild animal, ravening and unappeasable, but the sea does nothing, it is simply there, its own reality, like night, or the sky. Is it the heave and lurch and sudden suck of it that frightens? Or is it that it is so emphatically not our medium? I think of the world beneath the ocean, the obverse of ours, the negative of ours, with its sandy plains and silent valleys and great sunken mountain ranges, and something fails me in myself, something that is mine draws away from me in horror.9 Here is yet another version of nature's worrisome indifference, an attitude which never fails to unnerve as well as impress the observer. There is also the suggestive link with those parallel worlds of Banville's scientists and astronomers, except now this other world, 'the negative of ours', is below rather than above the earth. For one of those scientists, the sea is the most suggestive metaphor for the mystery at the heart of human inquiry: in the epigraph to The Newton Letter, Banville quotes the anecdotal remark attributed to Newton in which he compares his life's work to games played by a boy on the sea-shore, 'whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me'. Ever since those scientists sensed or imagined alternative worlds, Banville's narrators have been preoccupied with a feeling of alienation from their own world, as if, in Freddy Montgomery's phrase, their residence on earth was due to 'a cosmic blunder'. The silent, mysterious world of the sea exerts a magnetic attraction upon many of Banville's leading characters, who admire its forms and fear its powers. For many of these characters, the sea has an unavoidable and hypnotic association with death. The tragedy of Eclipse ? replayed and reimagined in Banville's next two novels, Shroud and The Sea ? is the suicidal death of a child through drowning. Alexander Cleave, continuing his reflections from the passage quoted above, recalls his morbid fascination with the sea and death: 139</page><page sequence="7">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW And drowning, of course, drowning is strange, I mean for those on shore. It all seems done so discreetly. The onlooker, attention caught by a distant feathery cry, peers out intently but sees nothing of the struggle, the helpless silencing, the awful slow motion thrashing, the last, long fall into the bottomless and ever blackening blue. No. All that is to be seen is a moment of white water, and a hand, languidly sinking (p.68). The horror of such a death, in such a strange medium, is offset by the beauty of the description ? an effect not uncommon in Banville. It is a remarkable fact about Banville's preoccupation with this image of the sea, and the related one of death by drowning, that his earliest fictions include explorations of the terror and the pleasure which they excite. Several of the short stories in Long Lankin are located by the sea, featuring children who explore its beauty and its mystery. 'Sanctuary', for example, centres around the image of a drowned girl, while in 'Summer Voices' the young girl is fascinated with the corpse of the drowned man, 'the twisted body, the ruined face, the soft, pale swollen flesh like the flesh of a rotted fish'. Three decades after these tales were written, the narrative of The Sea reads like a most elaborate and extended reflection upon them, as if this underlying fascination with the sea had taken a long time to find its ideal form. Further proof, if such were needed, of the profound grip of this image on Banville's imagination can be seen even outside his prose fiction, in his television play, Seachange (1994), a Beckettian reflection on the speechless grief of a mother for her drowned child. The related analogy of the swimmer, in the form of a simile or a metaphor, is one of Banville's favourite tropes, and is deployed to suggest a wide range of types, qualities, and emotions, in contexts triumphant as well as tragic. Academic success for Copernicus in the infernal world of the university of Padua is described as him having 'surfaced at last, like a spent swimmer flying upward into light, in whose aching lungs the saving air blossoms like a great dazzling flower'. In Athena, Morrow admires Aunt Corky's energy and determination, seeing her as 'a plucky swimmer dauntlessly breasting a sea of troubles'. There are darker, more tragic variations upon this idea and image, as in Mefisto, where the narrator, Gabriel Swan, recalls his arbitrary survival as a twin emerging from the amniotic sea of his mother's womb, T came first. My brother was a poor second. Spent swimmer, he drowned in air'. It is likely that the imaginative seeds of the tales about the death of children through drowning, and the inconsolable grief felt by their surviving parents, as relayed through Eclipse, Shroud, and The Sea, lie here in Mefisto, a novel which Banville himself recalls as full of difficult, unresolved tensions which affected its 140</page><page sequence="8">THE ART OF ANALOGY IN BANVILLE'S FICTION design and style, and which Gerd Kampen sees as a text of considerable autobiographical significance.10 Most poignant, and most disturbing, is the quasi-autistic personality of so many of the children involved, children who either will not speak, or cannot speak. In Eclipse, this personality and the terror which it experiences and provokes, are captured through the analogy of drowning, when Cleave catches the look on the face of an autistic teenager who had been playing with his daughter Cass, and who suddenly experiences a nervous seizure: It was a look such as one might receive out of a deep-sea diver's helmet when the air pipe has been severed. Way down in the dazed depths of that murky sea in which he was trapped, he knew; he knew (p.165). In many instances, the image of the sea, or of swimmers, offers Banville an analogy for the experience of not really being in the world, but rather at a remote, distressing angle to it. This submarine existence, or perspective, is a metaphor which explores the intolerably fine sensibilities of the deranged and the bewildered. Early on in Mefisto, Gabriel Swan recalls the strange Big House into which he was drawn, partly seduced by the silent beauty of the girl, Sophie: Indoors it was like being on a great ship at sea, the windows in their warped frames banged and boomed, and a grey, oceanic glow suffused the ceilings. Beneath the creaks, the ratttlings, there was a deep, undersea silence. This was Sophie's medium. It was as if something had been left switched off, like the lights in a blind man's house.11 Sophie's autistic world is largely, but not quite, suggested by the oceanic simile, inviting yet another simile of sensory deprivation to capture the quality of silence which she embodies. Maritime analogies like this abound in The Book of Evidence, appearing at those moments when Freddie tries to explain or illustrate the different quality of being and perception which marks those outside, or beyond, conventional society. His description of the visiting room in the prison relies on that predictable aquatic analogy: The room has a touch of the aquarium about it, with that wall of greenish glass, and the tall light drifting down from above, and the voices that come to us out of the plastic lattices as if bubbled through water. We inmates sit with shoulders hunched, leaning grimly on folded arms, wan, bloated, vague-eyed, like unhoused crustaceans crouching at the bottom of our tank (p.145). 141</page><page sequence="9">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW As so often, once the initial metaphor is established, analogies within the analogy present themselves, each one true to the idea behind the original image, as seen in the simile of the inmates as 'crustaceans', and later on when Freddie imagines that the visitors must hear the plaintive cries of 'the mermen's song'. Towards the end of his memoir, Freddie writes that his sense of isolation in jail is 'like being in the deep hold of a great, grey ship'. This figurative motif of Freddie as seafarer, embarked on a voyage of discovery, provides the organizing and mythical design behind the sequel to The Book of Evidence. Ghosts is arranged around a series of nautical dramas which come from a variety of sources, mythical, pictorial, and literary. The myth derives from the sea journey to Cythera, Aphrodite's island of love. The novel alludes to, and describes in rapturous detail, Watteau's eighteenth-century versions of the voyage, now fictionalized as Vaublin's Le monde d'or, other strong allusive presences in the novel include Shakespeare's The Tempest and Verlaine's Le Bateau ivre. Previously, in The Book of Evidence, Freddie leaves a Mediterranean island to return home to Ireland, the final stage of the journey being the less than mythical, all too drunken, sea-crossing from Holyhead to Dun Laoghaire. Having already started into his duty-free booze, Freddie begins to hallucinate, and senses a most unnatural force, 'as if the whole ship were straining to take to the air'. In Ghosts, the reverse of this journey takes place, and he escapes to an island refuge from the mainland. While his quest on the island has clear legendary and mythical parallels, the mock-epic and the farcical elements, rehearsed in The Book of Evidence, are never far away. He recalls his original journey down from Dublin after his release from prison, 'a sort of epic journey and I an Odysseus, homeless now, setting out once more, a last time, from Ithaca'. On his way down to catch a boat for the island, he makes a detour to his original home, where he suspects that his wife still lives. No Penelope awaits him there. Instead, his nervous re-entry into the old house conjures up most of the spectral, disabling sensations we have come to associate with the metaphor of the sea, as well as that familiar sense of being watched: I shut the door behind me and stood and took another deep breath, like a diver poised on the springboard's thrumming tip. The furniture hung about pretending not to look at me. Stillness lay like a dustsheet over everything. There was no one at home, I could sense it. I walked here and there, my footsteps falling without sound. I had a strange sensation in my ears, a sort of fullness, as if I were in a vessel fathoms deep with the weight of the ocean pressing all around me (p.180). 142</page><page sequence="10">THE ART OF ANALOGY IN BANVILLE'S HCTION Instead of meeting his wife, Freddie encounters his teenage son, Van, a child whose silence distresses the father to distraction, yet another incarnation of this recurrent figure which haunts Banville's work. Gabriel Godkin's incestuous brother Michael is an early version, as is Heinrich, Kepler's brother, and Freddie, Victor Maskell's brother. In the earlier fictions, the image of the damaged sibling is part of the motif of twins, or of a twinned self. But with the advent of Freddie, the autistic child becomes a singular object of paternal fear and dread, and the sea as the source of both life and death begins to emerge. In a pattern which is quite characteristic of Banville, the motif of the damaged and the drowned child at the heart of Eclipse seems to have been prefigured in earlier fictions, and then distilled into a drama of its own: Shroud, we might say, is Eclipse seen, or written, in reverse. The Sea is a kind of coda to both novels, the essential story of childhood, memory, and loss which the earlier narratives could not complete, and for which they seem like imaginative explorations. If nature is one of the dominant sources of metaphor in Banville, so too is art, its seeming opposite. For most of Banville's narrators, there is nothing 'natural' about nature, which all too often seems like a beautifully contrived representation of an elusive, absent original, a kind of fallen underworld. The narrator of Ghosts, for example, offers his own solemn and decisive pronouncement upon this matter ? 'Nature did not exist until we invented it one eighteenth-century morning radiant with Alpine light'. In this view of things, nature itself is an artistic construction, a work of art. For those characters who repeatedly remark upon the artifice of nature, this is no cause for disappointment or disillusion: on the contrary, such a contrived natural order seems a most fitting landscape for those who feel themselves to be mere actors in someone else's idea of a drama. The theatrical challenge for art as well as nature is to see which offers the most convincing imitation of a lost ideal. If analogies drawn from nature suggest the unreal quality of earthly existence, those drawn from art, or more precisely, the sister-arts, complement and reinforce this notion of an unnatural order. The self-conscious sense of performance, rhetorical and behavioural, which marks so many of Banville's characters, is repeatedly expressed through analogies with theatre. Most of these characters are aware of playing a role, of imitating some version of themselves to conceal another, darker one, or being forced to adopt a mask for want of any authentic, or 'natural' character of their own. Some of these characters, like Freddie Montgomery, much prefer their assumed identity to their normal one, and lament the fact that their performance must have an ending: sensing his imminent capture, Freddie remarks, theatrically, 'What an actor the world has lost in me!' A series of protagonists are 143</page><page sequence="11">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW characterized as performers: the Irish-born Victor Maskell devotes his life to the imitation of an English-born gentleman-scholar; Alexander Cleave decides to become a professional actor since he has never known how to stop performing for others, and Axel Vander is quite frank about his duplicitous character, 'a thing made up wholly of poses'. The theatrical motif in Banville probably begins in Birchwood, where the young Gabriel Godkin joins Prospero's travelling circus, and is thrilled with the freedom which his acquired identity as 'Johann Livelb' gives him. The metaphor of individual performance is just one of several imagined versions of a theatrical life. Another is that uncanny sense, expressed by so many characters, of viewing urban landscapes as stage sets, and rural landscapes as stage-scenery, both of them sites for some carefully arranged simulacrum of the real thing. In The Newton Letter, we can appreciate this conceit of an invisible hand at work when the narrator confesses to an eerie sense of the landscape outside his cottage assuming different shapes every time he turns his back, remarking at one point, 'In the morning when I looked out the kitchen window the scenery was rearranged'. In Ghosts, when the narrator walks out of jail into Dublin city centre early one morning, after many years of imprisonment, he cannot believe that the city is simply there, inanimate and innocent ? 'Everything looked like an elaborate stage-set, plausible but not real'. Victor Maskell recalls the inescapable feeling in war-time London that the streets were like stage-sets, scaled down, two dimensional, their bustle and busyness tinged with the pathos of something set in motion only so that it might be violently halted'. A variation upon this theatrical metaphor is that of the actor losing control of his role: Alexander Cleave becomes increasingly bewildered by the presence in his house of Quirke and his daughter, Lily, feeling that they are like ghostly spectators of his performance ? 'as if they had stood up in their seats and ambled on to the stage while the play was going on, interrupting me in the middle of an intense if perhaps overly introspective soliloquy'. This is yet another imaginative refinement of the theatrical metaphor, suggesting that sense of panic or hysteria during performance, when an actor 'corpses' on stage, and the fantasy turns into either a farce or a nightmare. In The Sea, Max Morden experiences this terrifying sensation when, after a senseless effort to interview a woman about his early childhood years, he remembers feeling 'quivery and vapourish, like a diva tottering offstage at the end of a disastrous night of broken high notes, missed prompts, collapsing scenery'. The metaphor of performance captures many of Banville's favoured themes, most notably that of the divide in the individual between the natural and the contrived, between the social mask and the inner self. In effect, a divide may no longer even exist, at least no 144</page><page sequence="12">THE ART OF ANALOGY IN BANVILLE'S HCTION such distinction can survive for very long, since what once seemed 'contrived' has become 'natural' through habit, and so the difference between art and nature no longer really matters. Most effective, and most appropriate, is the sense which the metaphor gives of the subjective emotions which role-playing generates, from exhilaration to panic, from joy to terror. This trope captures well that sense of the fragility and the loneliness of the individual performer and his performance, and a world in which the illusion of truth is all-important. Besides theatre, another of the sister-arts of wide-ranging metaphorical significance is that of painters and painting, emphasizing, once again, the narrative sense of artful being, but also the richly visual quality of Banvillean metaphor.12 The widespread pattern of analogies with paintings seems to begin during the scientific tetralogy, notably in The Newton Letter, where, for example, the anonymous biographer starts to see the people around him as living reflections of famous paintings or painters: on one occasion he looks at Ottilie, Edward, and the child, seeing them 'posed in a north light by the window like models for the Madonna of the Rocks', while on another occasion he is taken aback by the change in Charlotte's appearance, remarking 'Less Cranach now than El Greco'. Faces always remind Banville's narrators of distinctive figures from the world of art ? Flora in Ghosts seems 'like one of Modigliani's girls', Aunt Corky in Athena, when rhapsodizing about art, puts on 'a Roualt face', while Nick in The Untouchable seems 'pale as ivory, his black hair standing on end, all eyes and angles, a figure out of Schiele'. Sometimes the analogy has a literary as well as an artistic character, as when Victor Maskell recalls the features of the Portuguese diplomat, Fonseca, who 'resembled Droeshout's portrait of Shakespeare, with his domed forehead and concave cheeks and watchful, wary eyes'. Most of Banville's allusions to painters and paintings offer a quick kind of visual shorthand, an instant suggestion, almost a caricature of a type or a pose. In most cases, the artistic analogy proposes a dark, almost 'Gothic' image, as we can see, for example, in a pair of artistic similes in Athena, where Morrow recalls the sado masochistic rituals he once performed with 'A': he saw himself 'towering over her like a maddened monster out of Goya, hirsute and bloody and irresistible, Morrow the Merciless', all the while watching A's face 'slack-mouthed in ecstasy like Bernini's St Theresa'. Occasionally, the pictorial analogies refer to the quality of landscapes rather than human figures, such as the 'Limbourg-blue sky' in Mefisto, or 'a Van Eyck setpiece' in Shroud. The literary significance of all this detail lies, perhaps, in what it tells us about authorial expectations of the reader. Banville relies deeply on these references and allusions to lend a certain 'learned' quality to his narrative, a quality which itself reflects an artistic connoisseurship on 145</page><page sequence="13">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW the narrators' part. In turn, the novels challenge the readers' level of learning and power of recognition. The reader who recognizes the allusion to a painterly style or a remarkable work of art will appreciate a very distinctive and suggestive pattern of meaning in a text, something which will be virtually lost on a reader without this kind of knowledge or experience. Banville's reader must be learned or curious, preferably both. There is a related fascination throughout Banville's work with the exotic detail and texture of the human anatomy, and a certain scientific as well as poetical pleasure in the arcane vocabulary available to those who would contemplate and describe the stranger elements of the body physical. Most of the rarefied, scientific vocabulary which the reader of Banville regularly encounters, deals with anatomical features or pathological conditions, especially those seen as morbid or abnormal. The following examples, drawn from the full range of Banville's fiction, and arranged alphabetically, give a representative idea of what the reader may encounter: 'adipose, blastomere, borborygmic, canthus, flocculent, integument, nates, oedemic, pachydermous, pandiculation, popliteal, strabismic, strangury, villous'. The reader will have to keep handy an authoritative dictionary or two, since several of Banville's narrators make very clear their own love-affair with this kind of linguistic resource. When Freddie Montgomery recalls the 'ataraxic bliss' of his days in America, he immediately anticipates the reader's curiosity, and admits to keeping a dictionary beside his text. Victor Maskell shares with the reader his intellectual fascination with the etymology of the word 'malignant', detailing with delight the relevant entry in his copy of the OED, while Max Morden cites what he calls his venerable and much-thumbed copy of Black's Medical Dictionary, whose anatomical illustrations 'never fail', as he perversely puts it, 'to freeze the cockles of my heart'. There is a strange, oxymoronic quality to some of these remarks and observations, suggesting a unique kind of pleasure associated with fear and revulsion, an aesthetic and sensual joy often inspired by grotesque images of the human body. The dream-like narrative reflections in Banville regularly betray an obsessive fascination with the imagery of anatomy, and the instinctive recourse to analogy to try and suggest the strangeness of its forms and textures. The recollection of erotic intimacies is often the most illustrative version of this heightened perspective on the body. Victor Maskell recalls a chance sexual encounter with a young soldier in a public toilet, and in doing so shows something of that paradoxical effect whereby a kind of beauty emerges from the most unlikely circumstances: As he knelt and ministered to me I ran my trembling fingers through his hair thick with dirt and fondled his neat little ears ? 146</page><page sequence="14">THE ART OF ANALOGY IN BANVILLE'S HCTION I always had a weakness for these strange organs, on close inspection so excitingly repulsive, with their frills and delicate pink volutes, like primitive genitalia that have fallen into disuse ? and goggled in blissful stupor at a shaft of sunlight falling athwart the beautiful, glistening, grass-green slime growing on the wall behind him, above the clogged trench, and in my head everything swirled ... all swirled and spasmed and sank, into the hot throat of the whirlpool.13 There is a wilfully perverse perspective here, whereby the act of fellatio in such unpromising circumstances is scarcely acknowledged: instead, the description focuses on those ears, 'so excitingly repulsive', whose microscopic detail invites comparison with architectural embellishments, and whose function and form are conflated with other sexual organs. A kind of narrative alchemy is at work here, whereby the unlikely setting for pleasure is transformed by style into a drama of sensuous and erotic ecstasy. The close, sardonic observation of physical detail, nearly always rendered through an analogy which suggests its odd, arbitrary form marks the visual observations of many of Banville's characters. The lecherous Rheticus, for example, observes 'a pretty fellow with an arse on him like a peach'; Gabriel Swan notices his uncle's chin, 'deeply cleft and mercilessly shaved, like a tiny pair of smarting buttocks'; the naked, post-coital Alex Vander is described as a parody of the beautiful lover, 'the pot belly and the shrunken acorn below and its bag suspended by an attenuated string of yellowed skin like a head of garlic on its stalk'. There is a fascinated blend, or confusion, of the beautiful and the grotesque in these analogies, the proportions between them hard to predict. The rhetorical accounts of the body, however, are nearly always perverse in their sympathies and effects, as we can see in the description by the narrator in Ghosts, trying to locate the source of his night-time pains, imagining 'some bruised little purple plum or orchidaceous fold of malignant tissue that might one day be the thing that would do me in to the accompaniment of exquisite torments'. This is yet another masochistic fantasy, in which the imagination translates the crude option of 'cancer' into a botanical metaphor suggestive of both beauty and lethal delicacy, the ultimate pathological paradox. In The Sea, Max Morden visits his wife, Anna, who is dying of cancer. She is keen to show her husband her photographic collection of people who had suffered appalling physical damage, specimens of extreme anatomical disorder, such as one might have witnessed 'in a casualty ward in a defeated and devastated city'. This attraction towards what is repulsive is a perverse strain of pleasure throughout Banville, showing a curiosity about the strange, unpredictable relation between images of beauty and horror. 147</page><page sequence="15">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW What might we conclude about the art of analogy in Banville? This art has a distinctive and illuminating history within his fiction, one which enjoys a special relationship with speech and reflection. In Banville's first two publications, Long Lankin and Nightspawn, there is little figurative life in the narratives. In these exploratory, adventurous fictions, dialogue is the stylistic basis of the narrative drama, a very spartan version of direct speech which tolerates little or no embellishment. After these stories, Banville's characters almost stop speaking entirely, and dialogue is dramatically replaced by subjective reflection. From Birchwood onwards, the novels favour a solipsistic narrative, a personal memoir or testimony, in which the past is recalled through image and analogy, as we see with Gabriel Godkin, who likens his sensuous fixation with memories to the trembling synaesthesia felt by 'an old casanova' rereading his 'old love letters, sniffing the dusty scent of violets'. In this reflective structure, characters move around the landscape in near silence. It might be argued that, from a very early stage, the fiction shifts decisively towards a kind of poeticized aphasia. As John Kenny has shown, silence is an important philosophical as well as stylistic metaphor throughout Banville, originating perhaps with the author's interest in George Steiner's classic Language and Silence.u This may be why the figure of the speechless child is such a recurrent presence in the novels, and why the natural world and inanimate objects, through a conceit favoured by Banville, seem to choose silence and indifference in the face of human scrutiny and longing. Banville's narrators are incurably and relentlessly analogical in these reflections. They can only describe the past through simile and metaphor, figures which are entirely natural to their way of imagining and describing that past. In The Sea, Max Morden starts to notice this narrative characteristic in his own reflection, and remarks, 'everything for me is something else, it is a thing I notice increasingly'. That same sense of powerlessness in the grip of analogy is also voiced by Morrow in Athena, who confesses T am like everything except myself. Metaphor, rather than author, seems to choose or determine the appropriate way of seeing and rendering the past, as if the writer is a mere midwife to the birth of an image. Nothing is simply itself, but always suggestive of something else which helps to reveal the nature of the original. This sense of the organic, interrelated design of nature and language is, according to Terence Hawkes, a neo-Romantic understanding of metaphor, one which originates with the poets Shelley and Coleridge, who saw metaphor, not as a special adornment to be grafted onto literal discourse, but as the 'natural' basis of a language which constructs a reality pleasing to the imagination.15 In this sense, analogy is not so much a figure of speech, but a way of seeing and experiencing the world. This attempt to suggest, or perhaps 148</page><page sequence="16">THE ART OF ANALOGY IN BANVILLE'S HCTION to deny, a distinction between the 'natural' and the 'artificial' in Banville's art of the analogy might be illustrated through his preferred form of comparison. In the strict grammatical sense, metaphor, with its decisive, assertive declaration of similarity, features rarely in Banville, whereas the simile, which explicitly proposes points of likeness, is the dominant form of analogy for all Banville's narrators. The simile, which draws grammatical attention to its imaginative and imagined proposal, is the natural medium of Banville's style, a suitably brazen form of analogy, one which plays a vital role in the elaborate rhetorical and stylistic performances of his narrators. It could be argued that Banville's poetic style, especially in its love of intricate and ingenious analogy, is quite unique in the history of the modern and the contemporary Irish novel. Every novelist since Joyce has shown a readiness to employ metaphor, even within a highly realistic mode,16 but nobody comes near Banville for the sheer intensity and density of a prose which depends utterly on analogy for its force and significance. If we were to locate a stylistic cousinage outside Ireland, then the names of Marcel Proust, Henry James, and Vladimir Nabokov offer themselves as the most likely candidates for direct influence, thus confirming, once again, Banville's belated engagement with classic modernism.17 NOTES 1.
