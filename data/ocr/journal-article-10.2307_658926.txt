<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORENDA AND A DEFINITION OF RELIGION By J. N. B. HEWITT Welfare is the primary motive underlying all human effort. To obtain food, shelter, and raiment, and to preserve life, man in all times and in all lands learned that he must struggle against the adverse conditions of his environment. Interpreted in terms of his self-centered philosophy, these unfavoring conditions were to the savage man the handiwork of mystic potence directed by the will of the environing bodies, purposefully wrought in such wise as to be inimical to his well-being. The savage man conceived the diverse bodies collectively constituting his environ- ment to possess inherently mystic potence, and to be living, thinking, willing, passionful beings who lived, thought, willed, became angry or pleased, like himself under like conditions. This conception persists up through barbarism, albeit vestigially, into civilization. That life is a property of every body whatsoever - inclusive of the rocks, the waters, the tides, the plants and the trees, the animals and man, the wind and the storms, the clouds and the thunders and the lightnings, the swift meteors, the benign light of day, the sinister night, the sun and the moon, the bright stars, the earth and the mountains thereof - is a postulate fundamental to the cosmologic philosophy of savage man; and, as a concomi- tant with this, primeval man made the further assumption that in every body of his self-centered cosmos inheres immanently a mystic potence of diverse efficiency and purpose, by the exercise of which the body puts its will into effect, and which sometimes acts independently, and even adversely, to the well-being of its director or possessor. Thus the Iroquoian Condolence Council AM. ANTH. N. S., 4-3* 33</page><page sequence="2">34 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 4, 1902 was an institution designed to give life and stability to the com- monwealth largely by the exercise of mystic potence. In the event of the death of a chief in one of the two phratries of nations, it is the duty of the cousin phratry of nations to condole with the bereaved phratry for its loss and to resurrect figuratively the dead chief by the potence of a prescribed ritual through the in- stallation of another person in his stead, bearing the title and insignia of the dead chief. But, because the ceremony largely concerned the dead and the rites of burial, it could not auspi- ciously be held in the spring or summer, lest it would kill the seed for planting and would blight the growing crops and fruits. Thus the mystic potence exerted in the promotion of their wel- fare in government was held to be destructive of the food supply of the people, should its exercise be untimely. In attempting to discuss ideas presumptively held by primeval man, it must be borne in mind at all times that his world, his cosmos, his universe, was not by any means comparable in extent to that of the modern man of science, and that his environment, his world, was not composed of interdependent bodies forming a system. By the former the earth was held to be an island, sup- ported on the carapace of a turtle floating in the primal sea, and whose extent was at first coextensive with his horizon, but lat- terly vaguely extending seventy-five or a hundred miles in any direction from his fireside. Thus, while the world or cosmos of the primeval man was measured by miles, the universe of the man of science is measured by hundreds of millions of miles, and is a member of a vast hierarchy of bodies, flying through space with inconceivable speed by a stupendous vortex motion toward a point in Hercules. Those accustomed to the dogma of a triune or multiple god- head, of inchoate monotheism, can conceive of such personalities only as emanations or manifestations of that deity; but, owing to a difference of viewpoint, this is a confusion of the thought and feeling of the childhood, or preferably, perhaps, the beasthood,</page><page sequence="3">HEWITT] ORENDA AND A DEFINITION OF RELIGION 35 of humanity, with the concepts, the sentiments, and the activities of the thought of enlightenment. True, it is most difficult, if not relatively impossible, to learn to feel and to think with the elder time, but if the thoughts, motives, feelings, and activities of savage mind are the subject-matter of serious study and interpre- tation, this must be done in so far as it may be possible so to do. And so it appears that primeval man was led by his egocentric method of reasoning to infer that the paramount motive under- lying the operations of the diverse bodies of his varying environ- ment was also the attainment of the welfare of these bodies, which was but too often, he painfully learned, at the expense of his own well-being, and frequently even of the life of his kind. From the monody of savagery to the multitoned oratorio of enlightenment, the way is truly long. To the inchoate mentation of primitive man music held close relationship with this subsumed magic potence. To savage mind, so beastlike in its viewpoints, singing or to sing had a significance and a purpose which greatly differ from the meaning and the motive associated with it today by the average cultured person of modern civilization and enlighten- ment; yet that earlier significance and purpose survive today, in a measure, in the mystical use of music among the diverse peoples of the world. To the incipient reasoning of the savage mind it appears that the phenomena of environing nature, produced by the operations of the bodies and beings thereof, occur in the ful- fillment by magic potence of the will of independent and self- sufficient personages, primitively largely zoic, though inclusive of man, but latterly dominantly anthropomorphic. Furthermore, since action or motion was held to be a manifestation of a sub- sumed mystic potence by living agents, and since activity is usually accompanied by sound or sounds, it followed naturally that noises or sounds were in like manner interpreted to be the certain evidence of the utterance, use, or putting forth of such mystic potence to effect some purpose by the bodies or body emitting sound. The speech and utterance of birds and beasts,</page><page sequence="4">36 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 the soughing of the wind, the voices of the night, the moaning of the tempest, the rumble and crash of the thunder, the startling roar of the tornado, the wild creaking and cracking of wind-rocked and frost-riven trees, lakes, and rivers, and the multiple other sounds and noises in nature, were conceived to be the chanting- the dirges and the songs-of the various bodies thus giving forth voice and words of beastlike or birdlike speech in the use and ex- ercise of their mystic potence. This hypothetic magic potence is, then, held to be the property of all things, all bodies, and by the inchoate mentation of man is regarded as the efficient cause of all phenomena, all the activities of his environment. And, to a living faith and trust in the reality of this subsumed mystic potence, this reified figment of inchoate mind, human ex- perience in all times and in all lands owes some of its most powerful motives and dominating activities. Now, this subsumed mystic potence has no name in the Eng- lish language that adequately defines it. The term "magic," which at first sight might suggest itself as already embodying that notion in its denotation, signifies something quite different. The Standard Dictionary defines magic thus: " Any pretended or supposed supernatural or occult art; a generic term for all occult arts. Specifically: (I) The pretended art of putting into action the power of spirits; especially, the pretended art of pro- ducing preternatural effects by bringing into play the action of supernatural or spiritual beings, of departed spirits, or of the occult powers of nature. (2) Sleight of hand; legerdemain. (3) Any agency that works with wonderful effect; the enchantment of beauty, art, or the like." And the Century Dictionary defines it thus: "Any supposed supernatural art; especially, the pre- tended art of controlling the actions of spiritual or supernatural beings; (2) Power or influence similar to that of enchantment, as the magic of love; (3) Conjuring; tricks of legerdemain." It is thus seen that magic, as defined by the lexicographers, de- notes an art, a method of doing something, hence this is not the</page><page sequence="5">HEWITT] ORENDA AND A DEFINITION OF RELIGION 37 mystic potence in question. But, without entering into detail which would lead somewhat afield, it may be suggested here that modern magic as defined above - sleight of hand, legerdemain, sorcery, or what not-was initially and primordially an imitative representation or dramatization, so to speak, of the operations of the mystic potence subsumed in the environing bodies. As a vestigial survival of this early phase of thought, may be cited here the well-known habit of the prestigiator of today while per- forming his tricks of making passes with his hands, fingers, and eyes, and of assuming characteristic attitudes and of uttering words purporting to be potent with magic power, to express or simulate the feigned effusion or projection of his mystic potence or his use of that of another body. This procedure is intelligible, seemingly, only on the presumption that the actor thus appeals to a common and living faith, albeit only vestigially held, of the beholders in a subsumed mystic potence in all bodies, and so its tacit assumption arouses no question. Now, this subsumed magic power is called wakd, or mahdpa, or Xube by the Siouan, manitowi by the Algonquian, pokunt by the Shoshonean, and orenda' by the Iroquoian tribes. And it is sug- gested that the Iroquoian name for the potence in question, orenda, be adopted to designate it. In proposing the term, it may be said in favor of its adoption that its signification, or, speak- ing with the logicians, its intension and extension, is better defined than that of the other terms mentioned. In further justification of the introduction of this neologism into the language, it may be said that it denotes a discrete idea, clearly defined and prolific in 1Among these people, according to dialectic differences, this hypothetic potence is called orJdnd' or kare-nd' by the Mohawk and Cayuga, olJnd' or kaliand' by the Oneida, gaeind' or oeind' by the Onondaga and Seneca, urditf by the Tuska- rora, and iarjdidd' or orjddd' by the Huron. Hence the Anglicized form orenda may be taken for the purpose in view. Among the Iroquoian tribes, however, the term otgon (dtgon'), denoting specifically the malign, deadly, lethal, or destructive use or exercise of the orenda-potence is gradually, it would seem, displacing the more general vocable, orenda, as a name for this hypothetic mystic potence, for the reason, it appears, that the malignant and the destructive, rather than the benign, manifestations of this subsumed mystic potence produce the more lasting impressions on the mind.</page><page sequence="6">38 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 the tongue whence it is taken. Moreover, it precipitates, so to speak, what before has been held in solution. Orenda is of easy utterance and of simple orthography, and so is readily enunciated. So, until a better name for the mystic potence under discussion is found, let orenda be used for it. The better to define the potence in question and the more clearly to exhibit the importance and the great influence which this concept had and still has upon the inchoate mentation of savage man, and consequently, vestigially at least, upon the men- tal activities of the civilized man of today, it may be well to trace, as succinctly as may be possible, its effect on the ideas of a definite people, the Iroquois, as these ideas are expressed in their lan- guage. Orenda is a hypothetic potence or potentiality to do or effect results mystically. A literal and a free rendering of some of the most striking and distinctively characteristic sentence-words of the Iroquoian tongue will best exhibit the deep significance of the orenda-concept in Iroquoian thought and feeling. A shaman, rartYndiowd'nte', is one whose orenda is great, power- ful; a fine hunter, rar~idlio', is one whose orenda is fine, superior in quality; when a hunter is successful in the chase, it is said, wd'thargifidog!'fini', he baffled, thwarted their orenda, i. e., the orenda of the quarry; but, conversely, should the huntsman return unsuccessful, it is said, wd'thoreidog!'fini', they (the game) have foiled, outmatched his orenda; if a person in a game of chance or skill defeats another, it is said, wd'ho war dogl'f~ni', he thwarted, overcame his magic potence, his orenda, i. e., the orenda of his opponent; at public games or contests of skill or endurance, or of swiftness of foot, where clan is pitted against clan, phratry against phratry, tribe against tribe, or nation against nation, the shamans, hatirt~iidiowd'nit', men reputed to possess powerful orenda, are employed for hire by the opposing parties respectively to exercise their orenda to thwart or overcome that of their antagonists, thus securing victory to the patrons of the successful shamans; when</page><page sequence="7">HEWITT] ORENDA AND A DEFINITION OF RELIGION 39 the elements are gathering and a storm is brewing, it is said, watriddfini', it (the storm-maker) is making, preparing its orenda; and when the lowering storm-clouds appear to be ready, it is said, iotredd6ini', it has finished, has prepared its orenda; these two expressions and their conjugational forms are equally applicable to an animal or bird that is angry or in a rage; with a suitable change of pronominal affixes, these same expressions are applicable as well to a man whose anger or wrath is aroused, and so would seek to put his orenda to use; a prophet or soothsayer, ratrie''- dats or hatreddtthd', is one who habitually puts forth or effuses his orenda, and thereby learned the secrets of the future; the orenda of shy animals and birds which it is difficult to snare or to kill, is said to be acute or sensitive, that is, in detecting the presence of the hunter, whether man or beast; anything whose orenda is reputed or believed to have been instrumental in obtain- ing some good or in accomplishing some purpose is said "to possess orenda " (ioridare'), just as a wealthy person is said "to have money," that is, "an abundance of money"; and if these things or portions of them be chosen and kept against the time of their use, they become what are commonly called charms, amulets, fetishes, mascots, shields, or, if you please, " medicine." Of one who is about to bewitch another male person, it is said, hkowa- tridohnieni', he is preparing his orenda for or against him; karhdahktken' wd'hdrio', i. e., it-an-evil-orenda it-struck-him, is said of one who, it is believed, died from being bewitched. And, roteriend6te' (hoteraind6,de'), he is arrayed in his orenda, and rote- renndte' (hoteriendde'), he has effused or put forth his orenda, are two expressions, sentence-words, which are said in reference to a man who is exerting his orenda for the accomplishment of some purpose, this is its primary signification; the first form, roterei- nd6te', has come to mean, as a secondary usage, he is hoping for it, is expecting it, because it was the habit to put on one's orenda to obtain what is desired; now, the second sentence-word, rote- re~ndte' (koderbhndde'), as a secondary meaning has come to signify,</page><page sequence="8">40 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 he is singing, is chanting, but literally, he is holding forth his orenda. Thus, singing was interpreted to signify that the singer, chanter, whether beast, bird, tree, wind, man, or what not, was putting forth his orenda, his mystic potence, to execute his will; hence, too, it comes that the shaman, when exerting his orenda, must sing, must chant, in imitation of the bodies of his environment. Let it be noted, too, that this is the only word signifying to sing, to chant, in the earlier speech of the Iroquoian peoples. In connection with this item it may be of interest to mention the fact that the Iroquois name for the common locust, the cicada, is kanen'khaq- thd', which is literally, " it habitually ripens the corn," in short, "the corn-ripener." It appears that this insect acquired this name because when it sang in the early morning the day became very hot; and so the inchoate mind of the Iroquois inferred that the locust controlled summer heat; its mere presence was not thus interpreted, but its singing was held to signify that it was exerting its orenda to bring on the heat necessary to ripen the corn. In like manner the rabbit sings, and by barking the under- brush at a suitable height, indicates the depth to which the snow must fall. Thus his orenda controlled the snow. Again, there is the sentence-word raterfind'iP ((haderbAnd'id'"'hd'), which signi- fies in modern usage, he habitually prays. It acquired this meaning because prayer was not originally a begging for a thing, but be- cause it was an act indicative that he who desired something from the body controlling it must lay down his own orenda. The literal rendering of this sentence-word is, " he lays down his own orenda," thus indicating submission, defeat, surrender, and, sym- bolically, plea for life, well-being. In this manner it appears that primitive man interpreted the activities of nature to be the ceaseless struggle of one orenda against another, uttered and directed by the beings or bodies of his environment, the former possessing orenda, and the latter, life, mind, and orenda, only by virtue of his own imputation; so it was natural for him to infer that to obtain welfare for himself</page><page sequence="9">HEWITT] ORENDA AND A DEFINITION OF RELIGION 41 and his kind and to avert ill-fare, he must needs exert his own orenda for that purpose, or, failing in this, he must needs per- suade by word, rite, or ceremony, another body or being-a plant or tree, a rock or mountain, a beast or bird, the water, the cloud, the sky, the darkness, and what not-to use in his behalf, the orenda of that body or being; but, gradually learning from the hard school of experience that he could do or could obtain some things without the aid and favor of the magic potence of some other body, he regarded himself to that extent only as inde- pendent of the effect of the orenda of environing bodies. And to influence or persuade other bodies to exert their orenda in his behalf or for his welfare, he further reasoned that, for this pur- pose, he must employ devices and methods which, judging from his own susceptibilities, would be most apt to obtain his own aid and favor under like conditions. He decided, therefore, that he must employ to this desired end, gifts, offerings, praise and flattery or worship, and even self-abasement the most abject. And, hence, further, in the stress of life, coming into contact or more or less close relation with certain bodies of his environment more frequently and in a more decided manner than with the other environing bodies, and learning from these constraining relations to feel that these bodies, through the exercise of their orenda, controlled the conditions of his welfare and in like man- ner shaped his ill-fare, he came gradually to regard these bodies as the masters, the arbiters, the gods, of his environment, whose aid, goodwill, and even existence were absolutely necessary to his well-being and his preservation of life itself. And these relations and the manner of obtaining the favor and gifts of these bodies gradually grew into tradition and vigorous custom, and in the flux of time developed into rite, ceremony, and a more or less elaborate ritual. The one requisite credential to this pantheon was the possession of orenda. And the story of the operations of orenda becomes the history of the gods. Only finite relations, finite phenomena, by emphasizing organ-</page><page sequence="10">42 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 ization, system, can call forth the feeling of the infinite-not the infinite, albeit, as it is understood by the man of science, but something infinite-and hence arise indefinite concepts of mas- ters, arbiters, gods, all having at first independent value. And the concepts of the masters, the gods, are continually recoined to meet varying environment, growing mentation, and the more complex organization of human activities. Hence religion, albeit a most highly developed expression of human activity, may be defined as any system of words, acts, or devices, or combinations of these, employed to obtain welfare or to avert ill-fare through the use, exercise, or favor of the orenda of another body or bodies. But in view of the fact that the primal law of growth is organization through the development and conservation of the congruous, it follows from this definition that any word, any act, or any device, or any combination of these, designed to induce some other body or bodies to use or exercise orenda for the purposes indicated above, must justly and essentially be termed religious. There appears no room to doubt that a living faith and trust in the reality and efficacy of this subsumed potence, this reified figment of incipient mentation, is not only the motive back of the following cited expressions of human activity and thought, but it is also the key to their interpretation;-the alleged performance of miracles; the uncanny practices of witchcraft; soothsaying, divi- nation, prophesying, blessing and cursing; all forms of prayer and worship; all superstitions; the Hell-broth of Shakespeare's three witches; the dogma or belief regarding the possibility of the crea- tion of something from nothing; the slaying of the black ram and black ewe and their devotion by Ulysses to the shade of Tiresias in Tartarus;,the mystic use of the Urim and Thummim in the ancient Hebrew sacerdotal cult; the plagues of Egypt, wherein two sets of sorcerers pitted orenda against orenda '; the raising 1 Reference is made here to the signs and wonders alleged to have been performed before the Pharaoh, Bai'enra-Meriamon-Menephtah-Hotep-Hima, by Moses with his magic rod or staff, the wand of Elohim, as related in the Book of the Exodus, the</page><page sequence="11">HEWITT] ORENDA AND A DEFINITION OF RELIGION 43 of the shade of dead Samuel by the alleged witch of Endor; the remarkable act of circumcision, related in the book of the Ex- odus, that stayed the power of the God of the Hebrews in his attempt, " by the way in the inn," to slay Moses; the " tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil," the mere eating of which could give eternal life and the knowledge of good and evil; all the arts of wizards, demonology and fetishism, and all the occult craft of the shaman, are one and all the legitimate fruitage of a belief in the reality of a subsumed magic potence inherent in all things. To savage minds it is the executive power of men and devils, angels and gods; it can destroy the living and can as well bring back to life the dead; in fact, it is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent; enchantment, exorcism, the evil eye, relics, holy springs, ordeal, bedevilment, and all the arts of soothsaying, are one and all activ- ities arising from the faith and trust in the efficacy of this sub- sumed magic potence or orenda. Thus, in the preceding discussion, it has been found that among the Iroquois orenda, a subsumed mystic potence, is regarded as related directly to singing and with anything used as a charm, amulet, or mascot, as well as with the ideas of hoping, praying, or submitting. In connection with this it may be inter- esting and instructive to recall the parallel fact that the English first three of which, it is claimed therein, were likewise enacted by the " wise men and the sorcerers " and " the magicians " who are denominated in the Hebrew text by their Egyptian name, Chartumim, and who were the chief priests of Raamses, Helio- polis, Zoan (Tanis), and Memphis. The reference is especially (I) to the changing of this wand of Elohim or magic rod into a serpent before the Pharaoh and its restora- tion to its normal state by the mere taking " by the tail" of the mystically wrought serpent, and (2) to the changing of the water of the Nile into blood and its restoration to water " after seven days were fulfilled," and (3) to the bringing forth from this river of a plague of innumerable frogs and their subsequent banishment, and (4) to the changing of the dust of the land of Egypt into a plague of sciniphs (or mosquitoes), all of which alleged miracles with the exception of the last, the wise men, sorcerers, and magicians, under the direction of Jannes and Jambres " who withstood Moses," were able to perform and they " did so with their enchantments." But, of a later contest it is said: " And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boil was upon the magicians," all of which is quite Amerindian in concept.</page><page sequence="12">44 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 4, I902 word " charm," defined in the Standard Dictionary as signifying, among other things, "any formula, act, or subject supposed to have a magical influence or power; an incantation; spell; amulet; to put a spell upon ; to protect as by a spell; as a charmed life,"- is derived through the French charme from the Latin carmen (cas-men), signifying "an utterance in solemn, measured, or melodious way, i. e., a song, oracle, or a magic charm." Cognate with which are Camena (or Cas-men-ja), the name of the goddess of song; cens-ere, " to declare, pass judgment on," with which may be compared Anglo-Saxon herian, " praise." With Cas-men the following cognate Sanskrit terms may be fruitfully compared: fans, to recite a sacred hymn or text to a god by way of praise; to praise; to make a solemn wish, whether blessing or cursing, resembling in this the Latin imprecari; to announce or com- municate. Afais, to wish; to hope in, put one's trust in; pro- nounce a blessing upon, wish good to. Cansa, a solemn utterance; imprecatio, a blessing or a curse; cursing (as an adjective). jasta, praised, esteemed as good or lucky; happy, cheerful. AGas or dfd', a wish; a hope. Acis, a wish or prayer, especially for good or welfare. Now, the better to set forth the fact that orenda is not re- garded by the Iroquoian speakers as a synonym of some biotic or psychic faculty, the Iroquoian names for life, soul, ghost, mind, and brain will be cited here, thus showing that orenda is not one of these. The mind is called o'nikofrd' and eribf'td' by the Mohawk, o'nikd"'ld' and dli~itd' by the Oneida, o'nigdfeie', Jiz"'dd', and gdid'dowe'dashd' by the Seneca, o'nikhd"'hd' and ono"'dohnid"'srd' inilO'drd' by the Cayuga, o'nigd"'hd' and jiigz'dd' by the Onon- daga, u'tiki''rd' and u'tik"'ne"'tcr' by the Tuskarora, ofdid"'rd' and eriP'tad' by the Huron. The soul is called awenija'sd' and othwaisrd' by the Cayuga, awerid'sd' by the.Mohawk, othwaskhd' and othwdi' by the Seneca, awelid'sd' by the Oneida, othwdi' by the Onondaga, awdrid'si' by the Tuskarora, and onP"ndn'kwd't by the Huron.</page><page sequence="13">HEWITT] ORENDA AND A DEFINITION OF RELIGION 45 The ghost or disembodied spirit is named o'skd'hard' and o'skeind' by the Mohawk, djisgdn' by the Seneca and the Cayuga, o'skeind' by the Onondaga, o'sko'hald' and o'ski~nd' by the Oneida, u'ndwak and u'skfi~nd' by the Tuskarora, and o'skenn' and djlsgdn' by the Huron. Life is called dn'hd' or otdn'hetc by the Mohawk, dn'hd' and odon'he'sd' by the Onondaga, dn'hd' and odon'htetrd' by the Cayuga, dn'kd' and otdn'ketc by the Oneida, dn'hd' by the Sen- eca, zn'he' and u'nid'nhdkt by the Tuskarora, dn'kd' and kion'- he'kwi' (whereby we live) by the Huron.

And, lastly, the following terms common to all the Iroquoian tongues are cited with their dialectic and other variations, name- ly, o'wishd' or ga'wishd', d'shd' or ga'shd', o'shdsdd' or ga'shdsdd', o'hdsdd' or ga'hasdd', o'hwt'serd' or ga'hwiserd' or ga'hwisrd', all denoting muscular or bodily strength, and, ga'shasdA'serd', ga'shasd&amp;i'srd', and ga'skasdei'sd', and ga'hasdishd' (the gender sign o- may be substituted in these latter for the initial ga-), sig- nifying not only muscular strength but also power in general- force, military strength, authority. Thus it is evident that as employed by Iroquoian speakers orenda is not at all one of these psychic or biotic actiVities. As vestigial remains of the belief in the possession of orenda, magic potence, albeit instinctively expressed, may be mentioned the common practice or habit of persons about to throw a stone or other missile, to blow on it or to asperge it by blowing on it particles of saliva, and doing in like manner when about to use an arrow, bullet, or other weapon. From objects orenda or magic potence may pass or be made to pass to actions or words or sounds uttered by the object possessed of the required orenda.</page><page sequence="14">46 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 So, certain acts, certain sounds or words become sacred and holy.
