<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.-NEW BOOKS. Riddles of the Spghinx. A Study in the Philosophy of Evolution. By A. TROGLODYTE. London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1891. Pp. xxvii., 468. The "Riddles of the Sphinx" are man's " relation to the World, to his Cause and to his Future ". The solution of the first is found in a, doctrine of the ultimate plurality of real existences; of the second, in the doctrine of "a personal and finite but non-phenomenal God"; and of the third, in a theory of immortality, graduated according to the degree of consciousness attained by the soul during its past. The ultimate real existences are " spiritual entities ". Before Time and the "world-process" they existed as a "chaos" of absolutely isolated and independent beings. The world-process began by a determination of the Divine Spirit to form the ultimate existences into a harmonious cosmos. From the interaction of the Deity and the many individual, beings, consciousness results. The form it takes in man is consciousness of the World on one side and of the Self on the other. With the world- process Time begins; and with Time, Becoming and Evil are conjoined. Evil springs from the resistance of the ultimate Egos to the harmonising Evolution of the cosmos. The process of Evolution, through all its stages, consists in the perfecting of individual existences by their group- ing into more and more perfect societies. After molecules have been formed from atoms and organismus from cells, the process is continued in the formation of animal and human societies properly so-called; the 'aim to which it is divinely directed being the coincident formation o perfect individuals and of the perfect societies to which they are adapted. The world-process is finite, having both a beginning and an end. At its beginning, is to be conceived the "Ipre-cos InIic " state where no order existed; at its end, the " post-cosmic " state of perfect order and adap- tation which will be attained when Becoming and Time have passed into Being and Eternity. This final state is the eternal and perfect activity of " perfected individuals in a perfect society ". The method to be adopted in philosophising is the " concrete meta- physical," opposed at once to the " abstract metaphysical" and to the "pseudo-metaphysical" methods. The abstract metaphysical method is that of Plato, and of the Platonists of all periods. It rightly seeks to explain the lower by the higher, but is wrong in its dualistic separation of the two. X The pseudo-metaphysical method may also be called "physical," and is the mnethod of those who would construct philosophy out of pure science alone. It is right in so far as it insists on the con- tinuity of all things and rejects dualism, but wrong in trying to explain the higher by the lower. The characteristic of the concrete metaphysical method is to be consistently and consciously " anthropomorphic," explain- ing everything from individual existences viewed as analogous to our- selves. As principles generally compatible with the true method in philosophy, the author recognises Berkeley's " spirits " and Leibniz's " monads," together with Aristotle's conerete individual viewed as primary reality (p. 164). All other principles are either " abstractions" or attempts to explain the higher by the lower. With the true meta- physical principles, modern science, and in particular the doctrine of evolution, must be shown to be in harmony. Science must besides con-</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 539 tribute elements to the structure of philosophy, though these cannot by themselves furnish a metaphysical doctrine. The philosophical con- struction must give satisfaction to human hopes. To satisfy practical aspirations is indeed the final aim of philosophy. Whoever fails to solve the riddles of the Sphinx, and is logical, becomes a prey to pessimism. The pessimism which results from the "positivistic" attempt to do without metaphysics is the present mnotive for philosophising; as histori- cally the motive has always been somie inexplicability that troubled the unquestioning acceptance of life and the world. Methods of philosophising to be altogether rejected are the " episte- mological " and the " psychological," or direct criticism of the validity of knowledge and the powers of the mind. The only reply that can be made to philosophical scepticism is the indirect one of constructing a metaphysical scheme that satisfies all aspirations. The choice be- tween the doctrine attained and scepticism is in the end an act of faith in one of two alternatives. On the one side, we are led from the posi- tivistic rejection of metaphysics to philosophical Agnosticism, or the doctrine of the Unknowable; from this to absolute Scepticisnm, which destroys scientific along with philosophical certitude, and from this to Pessimnism, or the doctrine that knowledge is practically as well as theoretically invalid, the ground of things being wholly perverse or ir- rational. On the other side, reconstruction of knowledge with the aid of metaphysical principles leads to a system of beliefs which, if we ac- cept, we can regard the world as rational, or at least tending to ration- ality. The pessimistic conclusion of the one line of thought may be con- sidered as a reduction to practical absuirdity, and the satisfaction of our aspirations, which is attained by means of the other, as a justification of the principles adopted. There is, at any rate, no other justification. The " reduction to pessin-iism " is an argument urged not only against the schools that reject metaphysics, but also against the " Pantheistic Monism " which the author sees to be the rival of his own Pluralism. The monistic doctrine is also attacked on intellectual grounds. Its prin- cipal weakness is found to be the assertion of the "1 real Infinite ". The infinite in any admissible sense is only a potential infinity in our thought. Intellectually, the idea of an " infinite whole " is self-contra- dictory. Morally, the attribution of infinity to God requires that all finite individuals, being coexistent, should be regarded as therefore coequal manifestations of the divinity (p. 314); whence the absolute distinction between good and evil vanishes. To his positions here the author seems for once to attribute a greater degree of novelty than they possess; but his argument is evidently independent, and deviates in some points from that of his predecessors. It may be said generally that the " Troglodyte's " pure metaphysics or ontology is of greater interest than the mrethods by which he arrives at it. Rejection of the "epistemological" and "psychological" miethods marks a fundamental defect in procedure. When these are rejected the "concrete metaphysical method" seems to be describable simply as " unanalytic ". The doctrine found to be common to Berkeley, Leibniz and Aristotle is really a result rather than a " method ". By "Agnosti- cism " is not usually meant Mr. Spencer's doctrine of the Unknowable, against which the author in his discussion of the agnostic positioln exclu- sively directs his attack (bk. i. ch. 2). Biological evolution is rather vaguely conceived; and the error is committed of supposing that Mr. Spencer's wider application of the doctrine was subsequent to the Darwinian revo- lution in zoology (pp. 177-9). " Real infinity " is a little too easily disposed of, e.g., when it is said to be inconsistent with the doctrine of evolution,</page><page sequence="3">,540 NEW BOOKS. because evolution is a " process," and if a world infinite in time were en- gaged in a process it would " require an infinite Time to reach any given point in the process, and an infinite number of infinities to reach the present, i.e., would never reach the present at all " (p. 257). By the hypothesis, the infinite time required is always given. The author seems to hold at once that Space is only ideal, and that real Space is limited. And when, in the course of his discussion of " Idealism versus Materialism," he says (p. 259) that " the existence of a reality outside ourselves is a fact, irresistibly attested by feeling, and one which does not require further proof," he might alimost be taken for a "natural realist ". In this last sentence, however, he does not do himself justice. As we go on, we find hinm arriving at an idealism of his own that is not defective from its incompleteness, but onlv from absence of an epistemological or psychological foundation. Dualism is expressly rejected, and matter in its scientific as well as in its ordinary sense is viewed as purely pheno- menal. The external world is held to be an appearance produced by the interaction of spiritual "mionads '. We miss a defence of the position in relation to the philosophical analysis of substance generally; but the author at least sees clearly the weakness of an attempt to found a philosophical theory on the objective assumptions of physical science. In detail, his rendering of monadism is a decidedly interesting effort of philosophical imagination. The theory of immortality, in particular, is well worked out. The essential idea here is that the " memory " of the monads always persists, but that it only begins to persist from one life to another under a personal form when a sufficient concentration of con- sciousness has been attained. The interest of speculations such as his own is for the author-accord- ing to some of his opening remarks-that, if accepted as true, they furnish a complete answer to pessimism, and that without such an answer, practical life in accordance with reason is impossible. Others may think they retain an interest, though practical philosophy can be constructed without them; and, in fact, the auithor attempts no ethical construction on the basis they supply. But where, in any case, does he find philosophic support for the view of certitude expressed at p. 19 ? "While science must reinain conscious of all sorts of improbable and barely possible theories, seeing that they may suggest fruitful experi- ments and so enlarge the bounds of knowledge, philosophy, when it has once decided on the right solution, must sternly and rigorously put aside all its rivals, even though its choice was originally arrived at by a very slender preponderance." This would not be accepted by the theorists of the " practical reason," with whom the author has some affinities, any more than by scientific agnostics; if at least it implies that philosophy, having chosen, ought not to remain conscious of any doubt that affects its conclusions. Is it not also rather hasty to make rejection of pessimism depend on acceptance of a pluralist metaphysic? Among the historical systems Buddhism found its principle of explanation in the Individual and Stoicism in the Whole. Neither system is thought to be wanting in logical elaboration; yet the first is pessimistic and the second optimistic. [T. W.] The Insanity. of Genius and the General Inequality of Human Faculty, physio- logically considered. By J. F. NISBET, Author of Marriaqe and 1eredity, &amp;c. London: Ward &amp; Downey, 1891. Pp. xxiv., 340. Mr. Nisbet's book is inainly a collection of more or less well- authenticated facts relating to the nerve-disorders of every kind that</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 541 have accompanied genius either directly or by way of heredity. The' collection itself is extensive and interesting, whatever may be thought of the interpretation. The author's positioni is that " genius and insanity are, in reality, but different phases of a morbid susceptibility of, or a want of balance in, the cerebro-spinal system ". Or, as it is expanded in another passage: " Genius, insanity, idiocy, scrofula, rickets, gout, con- sumption, and the other members pf the neuropathic family of disorders, are so many different expressions of a common evil-an instability or want of equilibrium in the nervous system ". Genius is here taken in the widest sense, as including all the higher manifestations of the practical, as well as the scientific and artistic, types of mind. In all cases, " what runs in the blood is nerve-disorder, of which genius is the occasional outcome ". The defect of Mr. Nisbet's attempted proof of this thesis is that he hardly goes beyond an enumeration of positive instances-superficially in its favour. The necessity of a comparative study of men of genius and un- distinguished persons is,indeed glanced at in the last chapter, but that is all. For anything like scientific induction, comparison should of course have been systematic and continuous. As a preliminary to the com- parative treatment, it would have been desirable to attempt some approximate psychological definition of genius on the one side and insanity on the other. From this the author perhaps cuts himself off by his view that scientific knowledge of mind only began with experiments in cerebral localisation; but even from the purely physiological point of view there are obvious defects in his procedure. Genius is said to con- sist in " morbid susceptibility " of the nervous system. But how are we to know whether any particular degree of suseeptibility is " morbid " or not ? According to the author, simply by the presence of genius. For example: " Such immense creative power as Shakespeare's can only be understood in connexion with a morbid impressionability ". If this does not quite reveal the argumentative process, more light is thrown upon it by another position, of which use is made throughout the book. " Both short life and long life in excess are symptoms of the neuropathic condi- tion, as, indeed, is every marked departure from the mean of existence." In other words, superiority and inferiority to the average are to be classed together as deviations from the normal; and all deviations from the normal are to be called morbid. Then again, in particular citations of facts, the thesis to be established is taken for granted in a curious way. Accomplishments or distinctions in the ancestors and connexions of men of genius are cited in support of the author's theory just as if they had already been proved to be "neuropathic". A few instances may be quoted. "Southey states that Cowper's father and uncle could both write verses-an ominous gift! " (p. 84). " Wordsworth's father was a man of ' great force of character '-a phrase which occurs with remark- able frequency in the family history of the insane " (p. 120). The " un- balanced condition of mind" of Bulwer Lytton's maternal grandfather "revealed itself in an extraordinary capacity for acquiring languages ancient and modern " (p. 128). Browning's father " possessed the significant gift of verse-writing " (p. 135). Balzac's mother " is described as a woman of ' great vivacity of mind, untiring activity, and extra- ordinary firmness'-phrases which, in the circumstances, are of some significance to the pathologist" (p. 135). "Among other peculiarities the elder Balzac had an extraordinary memory " (p. 136). Alfred de Musset's " mother's family appears to have been characterised by some nervous instability, his maternal grandfather having a prodigious memory " (p. 137). "Victor Hugo's mother, for her part, had also some peculiarities, being, in particular, energetic and sensitive" (p. 142)&gt;</page><page sequence="5">542 NEW BOOKS. "'There was a marked strain of literary ability in Corneille's family" (p. 144). "With the insane temperament" Michel Angelo "inherited from his father longevity, both dying at the age of ninety" (p. 174). "The hereditary influences which conduced to Marlborough's disorders are indicated in the fact that his father was a man of letters," &amp;c. (p. 194). " Of George Herbert's brothers one was a sceptical writer, the second a reilowned duellist, and the third a dashing naval officer-the two last showing that courage, like so many forms of genius, depends upon a congenital want of mental balance " (p. 251). Would not all these ex- amples seem more appropriate in an argument for " hereditary genius"? It is worthy of note that the only detailed case in which the author tries to show directly an " access of faculty along with morbid conditions " (p. 44) is much more easily explicable on the " hereditary genius " than on the " insane " theory. D)ifferences in the Nervous Organisation of Malt and Woman: Physiological and Pathological. By HARRY CAMPBELL, M.D., B.S. (Lond.), &amp;c. London: H. K. Lewis, 1891. Pp. xi., 383. This is a book of investigation more than of definitive general results, but, as such, it is of great interest. Its central subject is the comparative physiology and pathology of the nervous system in men and women-one conclusion being that women are less liable to gross lesions of the nervous system, and recover more easily from nervous disease, than men. As a groundwork for the special investigation, the origin of sex in general is considered; Weisniann's views being carefully discussed. Inclining, for reasons given, to the position that really acquired characters are not in- 1herited, the author suggests, in distinction frona Weismann, that the " germ-plasm " is not to be regarded as a homogeneous substance, but as consisting of individualised units. The ground of all secondary sexual differences he is disposed to find in extrinsic rather than intrinsic causes; and even, to a considerable extent, in extrinsic causes acting during the lifetime of the individual. In connexion always with his physiological and pathological basis, he deals very fully with the comparative psycho- logy of the sexes; and is thence led on to general human psychology. Here he has been especially influenced by Dr. Hughlings Jackson, whose views he applies with independent grasp to the psychology of volition. In strength of will, as in general intellectual power, Man is at present, he finds, on the average superior to Woman, but this average superiority is almost wholly, if not wholly, due to training. The important differ- ence is not in intellect or will (which largely depends on intellect) all round, but consists in the far greater " variability " of man than of woman. The difference is seen throughout the animal kingdom; in the human race it displays itself (on the positive side) in the fact that " genius of the highest order is practically limited to the male sex ". These are only the author's most general points. His detailed treatment is marked by care- ful collection of facts, many of them the result of personal investigation, and by forcible reasoning on them at every stage. Both for the material and the stimulus it supplies, the book ought to be in the hands of all psychologists. The History of Human Marriage. By EDWARD WESTERMARCK, Lecturer on Sociology in the University of Finland, Helsingfors. London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1891. Pp. xix., 644. This is the completed work begun with a dissertation noted in MIND, xv. 288. Its specifically sociological character sets it outside the province of this Review, but it is not out of place to remnark that the author's</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 543 equipment, logical as well as psychological, for his task is of a very excep- tional order. Such an effectively mustered collection of facts bearing more or less directly on the human relation of marriage did not before exist, and the author's conclusions as to the development of the relation from its biological beginnings are in general as circumspectly as they are always independently reasoned out. Justice: being Part IV. of 1The Principles of Ethics. By HERBERT SPENCER. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1891. Pp. viii., 291. The author has usedihis reviving strength since 1890 (after four or five years of disablement) to advance with that crowning division of his system of philosophy upon which most work remains to be done. Within the division he has chosen to follow up the introductory Data of Ethics with the present pt. iv. ; leaving pts. ii., iii. (" The Inductions of Ethics," " The Ethics of Individual Life ") to appear, as he hopes, before the close of next year, and meaning, thereafter, to complete the present beginning of " The Ethics of Social Life " with two nmore parts- of " Negative Beneficence " and " Positive Beneficence ". The Justice has a special interest in relation to the Social Statics of forty years ago- vears during which the author has not stood still either in his general way of ethical thinking or in his judgment on specific ethical topics. Critical Notice will follow (in the Second Se'ries of MIND). Freedom as Ethical Postulate. By JAMES SETH, M.A., George Munro Pro- fessor of Philosophy, Dalhousie College, Halifax, Canada. Edin- burgh and London.: W. Blackwood &amp; Sons, 1891. Pp. 48. For the author, " as for Kant, the question of freedom takes the -form of a deep-seated antithesis between the interests of the scientific or in- tellectual consciousness on the one hand, and the moral and religious convictions of mankind on the other ". The only hope of finding a place for real free-will is "in another than the Humian, empirical or 'psychological' account of the moral Person or Self ". A negative con- tribution to the vindication of freedom was made by Kant when he showed that the Ego is not itself under the dominion of the categories by which it constructs the world. Hegel's and Green's attemDt at a further positive vindication of - freedom is found to be unacceptable in so far as it leads to a view of the self which again brings it uinder necessity.' The suggestion is then made that perhaps Per- sonality ought to be regarded - as an ultimate term in philosophical explanation. This puts insuperable difficulties in the way of any 'mnonistic' explanation of the universe. but "we may still accept freedom as the ethical postulate, as the hypothesis, itself inexplicable, upon which alone morality becomes intelligible ". Absolute iiniformity not having been proved of human action, it is still as open to the advocate of freedom theoretically as it is necessary in view of the demands of morality, to " contend for a power of free and incalculable initiation in the self An Introductiont to Gudworth's Tr-eatise concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality, with Life of Cudworth and a few Critical Notes. By W. R. SCOTT, First Senior Moderator in ' Logics and Ethics," Trin. Coll., Dublin. London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1891. Pp. xiii., 67. The author (whom one takes to be a young man) aspires to do more justice to Cudworth than he thinks the Cambridge philosopher has yet received. He has therefore got ready for press an edition of the ethical</page><page sequence="7">544 NEW BOOKS. Treatise, and will apparently make its publication dependent on the reception accorded to this Introduction sent out before. He has aimed at shortness (which is well) and has therein succeeded; for, apart from a very general summary of the \Treatise (20 pp.), his own introductory observations run to just 8 pp., and his "Critical Notes" (touching on Butler and Kant) to but 5 more. What is more to the purpose-these few pages give fair indication of familiarity with some at least of the philosophic thinkers upon whom Cudworth draws or with whom he 'has to be set in relation. By all means, therefore, let us have his edition of the Treatise. As to the biographical part, filling nearly one half, of his present little volume, one may not speak with much commendation. It has no novelty, and is crudely written (witness the " howevers " on p. 13 and the " buts " on p. 15). To speak of "Shaftesbury, Warburton, and Bumet " [which Burnet ?] as representing "seventeenth century criticism " (p. 16), strikes unpleasantly; the " Whitecote " of p. 9 n. is, of course, meant for Whichcote. Generally, what strikes the author most in Cudworth (pp. v., 36), for all his overpowering burden of ancient lore, is his saturation with " the modern spirit ". It is a thesis that will need very careful development in the coming edition. Vatural Theology. By BERNARD BOEDDER, S.J. (" Manuals - of Catholic Philosophy "). London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1891. Pp. xii., 480. This volume, completing the " Stonyhurst Series" of philosophical manuals (See MIND, xiv. 290), treats of the questions usually discussed in the Latin text-books under the headings of Theologia Naturalis and Cos- mologia. It is divided, after an Introduction (pp. 1-7) into three books: i. "Of the Existence of God"; ii. "The Divine Attributes" iii. "The Action of God upon this World ". Essays, Reviews and Addresses. By JAMES MARTINEAU, hL.D., D.D., &amp;c. Selected and revised by the Author. Vols. II.-IV. London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1891. Pp. viii., 576; viii., 579; x., 608. These volumes, completing the author's collection of his occasional writ- ings (see MIND, No. 62, p. 285), are occupied with topics that have all, more or less, a philosophical import; but in vol ii., designated " Ecclesiastical: Historical," the "practical bearings on human life in historic schools and organised churches" are kept moreprominent, while vol. iv., " Academical: Religious," includes, with a series of college-addresses, a selection of hor- tatory sermons. Vol. iii., " Theological: Philosophical," contains in its first division some essays (on the general thouight of Oersted, Mansel, H. Spencer and others) that might equally well have been ranged with those that make up the second. As they stand, the essays or reviews given as expressly "philosophical" are occupied with Whewell as moralist, S. Bailey as logician, Hamilton and Mill as philosophers, Bain as psychologist, and finally with the question " Is there any Axiom of Causality ? " This last is raised to a great extent in colnexion with Mill's treatment in the Logic, and generally, it may be noted, throughout the division it is Mill who, with whatever hostile criticism, receives highest appreciation. In this connexion, an incidental footnote (p. 339) to a trenchant exposure of Whewell's ethical pretensions, in 1845, has a peculiar interest: " The quietness with which this book [J. S. Mill's Systemn qf Logic, spoken of in the text as "a work which stands almost alone, certainly pre-eminent, among treatises on philosophical method "] has been received affords no test of its destined influence. We believe there are not half-a-dozen persons in England capable of reviewing it." Many other such observa- tions of first-hand historic interest aie here reproduced by Dr. Martineau;</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 545 and, spread as his writings have been over such a width of time, they thus acquire a value as 'documents,' over and above their intrinsic importance as philosophical judgments always sincerely argued and most eloquently expressed. Kant's Principles of Politics, including his Essay on Perpetual Peaci. A Contribution to Political Science. Edited and translated by W. HASTIE, B.D., &amp;c. Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1891. Pp. xliv., 148. The pieces brought together under this title are, as here named, (1) "The Natural Principle of the Political Order considered in connexion with the idea of a Universal Cosmopolitical History," (2) " The Principles of Political Right considered in connexion with the relation of theory t; practice in the Right of the State," (3) "The Principle of Progress considered in connexion with the relation of theory to practice in International Law," (4) "Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Essay "'. They are given as a complement to the Rechtslehre, translated by Mr. Hastie three or four years ago (see MIND, xii. 301), and as the proper' crown of Kant's philosophic activity. The Time-Relations of M11ental Phenomen(t. By JOSEPH JASTROW, Professor of Psychology in the University of Wisconsin. (" Fact and Theory Papers,". No. vi.) New York: N. D. C. Hodges, 1890. Pp. 60. A very well-filled paper, giving account of the whole range of recent experiments on the time taken up in mental operations, from " simple reactions " to acts of distinction and choice. The object is " to present a systematic sketch of what has been done, with due reference to the ultimate goal as well as to the many gaps still to be filled ". Etude sur les I ry1umeats d P Zid,?on d' glee contre le Mou&amp;vement, par G. FRONTERA. P'aris: flachette et Cie., 1891. Pp. 23. In view of the position taken up by some philosophic teachers in France, that the arguments of Zeno against motion are in part at least irrefutable and prove that it cannot be construed rationally as a reality in, the metaphysical sense, the author examines all four argu- ments from the mathematical point of view. He finds thq difficulties in the more plausible arguments (the ' Dichotomy' and 'Achilles') to be caused (1) by taking, account of space and its (ideal) infinite divisibility to the exclusion of time, any-finite portion of which is infinitely divisible in precisely the same sense, and (2) by arbitrarily fixing the space to be traversed. Les Hallucinations teldpathiques par MM. GURNEY, MYERS et PODMORE. Traduit et abrege des Phantasms of the Living par L. MARILLIERS avec une Prdface de M. CH. RICHET. Paris; F. Alean, 1891. Pp. xvi., 395. The 1300 pages of Phantasms of the Living are here, in translation, brought down by more than two-thirds, so as to give them the better chance of winning a wdy with the "positive and sceptical" French mind. For, though France is pre-eminently the land of hypnotic subjects,' M. Richet seems to fear that "les revenants et les fan- t6mnes" are there more likely than elsewhere to be met with smile or shrug. The boiling-down, of course, could not be done without sacrificing much that was most characteristic and also most valuable in Gurney's massive volumes. Of the theoretic discussions, in which he expatiated with that large power of his, only as much is given as suffices 35</page><page sequence="9">646 NEW BOOKS. in any way to string together a free reproduction of the narrative "cases". Granted the principle on which the translation has been made, much praise is due to M. Marillier for his execution of a task of selection far from easy; but one abatement must be made from this acknowledgment. He nowhere states how the original work was actually composed: all of it issuing from Gurney's hand, except some 80 pp. of introduction and supplementary discussion by Mr. Myers. For want of such indication, the French reader is left to puzzle out the difference'between the " je " of the (here shortened) Introduction and the " je " of the book. That is a pity; nor is the translator's oversight at all repaired by what his introducer says on the suibject. For M. Richet, after first going the length of ascribing "tnme part preponderante" in the work to Gurney, has so much regard to survivors that he straightway adds apologetically: "Je ne crois pas etre desagreable a ses collabo- rateurs en disant que la part qu'il a prise au plan comme a 1'execution des Phantasms of the Living a ete considerable ". Upon which one can but exclaim-Considerable, indeed ! Passing away from this topic, it is interesting to note that M. Marillier translates without yet being a convert to belief in telepathy, but looks for some scientific decision to the statistical inquiry which is now being carried on in different countries and which it is desired to bring to a head for the International Congress to be held in London next year. M. Richet, who may be called a believer already, pushes 'aside for his part both reasoning and observation (which between them must cover statistical investigation) as decisive tests, and would rely upon experiment only-experiment that should admit of indefinite repetition at will. That seems a still straiter adhesion to method of science, but one's hope of M, Richet's strenuousness is somewhat dashed by the fact that, while he plumply allows that, " malgre tous nos efforts, nous n'avons pu, ni les uns ni les autres, demontrer rigoureusement qu'il y a suggestion mentale, trans- mission de la pensee, lucidite', sommeil a distance," he yet does not doubt (p. x.) that the experimental demonstration, thus far absent, will soon be forthcoming-and meanwhile is, apparently, satisfied not to let his own conviction wait upon its advent. La Philosophie du Siecle. Criticisme-Positivisme-Evolutionnisme. Par E. DE RXOBERTY. Paris: F. Alcan, 1891. Pp. viii., 235. In this book the author's philosophic doctrine set forth in L'Ancienne et la Nouvelle Philosophie and L'Inconnaissable (see MIND, xii. 620, xiv. 456) is expounded anew with developments and modifications. The three typical philosophies of the century are found to be the Criticism of Kant and his successors, the Positivism of Comte, and the Evolutionism of Mr. Spencer. All three are at bottom "metaphysical ". " Scientific philosophy " is not yet founded, and we must not expect to see it foLnded just yet. Before there can be a genuinely scientific philosophy there must be a considerably greater development of psychology and sociology as special sciences. To-day all philosophy is necessarily metaphysical, because in trying to integrate knowledge it inevitably makes unverifiable hypotheses derived from some particular group of sciences. According to the particular -group of sciences in which the key to the whole system of things is sought, is the nature of the philosophy. The Critical philosophy takes its origin from Idealism, the Positive philosophy from Materialism, and the Evolutionist philosophy from Sensualism; these three older philosophic doctrines being respec- tively (as was formerly contended) explanations of the universe by exclusive reference to psychical and social phenomena, to inorganic</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 547 phenomena, and to biological phenomena. The three doctrines in their present form tend to converge, and in- many ways may be regarded as expressions of a single m-ietaphysical system determined by the state of the sciences generally. (Besides, when their antecedents are strictly examined, all the contemporary systems show themselves to be of mixed origin.) The first law of intellectual development was ascertained to be the dependence of philosophy on the state of the special sciences. This is now supplemented by other laws, the whole dependence within the "c intellectual series " being stated in this form:-Science, philosophy, esthetic and industrial art constitute- a series, each term of which depends on all that precede it. Comte's law of the three states is acutely criticised from the point of view attained. Le nouiveau Mysticinsme. Par F. PAULHAN. Paris: F. Alcan, 1891. Pp. 203. This essay-portions of which have appeared in the Revue Philosophique under the same title (see MIND, xvi. 152)-is an attempt to forecast the spirit of the immediate future from indications in the philosophy, science, art, and general social movement of to-day. Marked by a certain con. trast to the spirit of the immediate past-individualist and more purely intellectual as this was-the " new spirit " has in common with it the effort after exact scientific knowledge. With this it combines the desire for the ideal, for the marvellous, and for "c synthesis " both in theory and practice. A transitional step between the " anarchy " resulting from the earlier movement and the "c new mysticism " that is beginning to acquire shape, is the " love of evil "-a phenomenon explicable, as the author thinks, by the anarchy of beliefs, the consequent letting loose of repressed desires, a certain persistence of an older moral or religious ideal, and an individual desire for synthesis; the natural result of this conflux of elements being an inverted ideal. By itself, the "love of evil " would lead only to social decadence, hut, as it does not exist alone, it may be taken as one symptom of the prepar'ation for a new order. The author's psychological ability is seen in the details of his analysis. Premiers Principes Me6taplh.ysiques de la Science de la Nature. Par EMMANUEL KANT. Traduits par CH. ANDLER et ED. CHAVANNES. Paris: F. Alcan, 1891. Pp. cxxx., 96. This, the first French translation of Kant's Metaphysische Anfangsgrkinde der Naturwissenschaft, has already appeared in the Critique Philosophique (1888-9). It is now preceded by anmextensive introduction, setting forth the principles of Kant's philosophy as applied to natural science not only in the Metaphysische Anfangsgriinde but in his other works. The introduc. tion is divided into five chapters: (1) Metaphysics of Nature in general, (2) Metaphysics of material Nature, (3) Passage from Metaphysics to Physics, (4) Changes brought about by the Critique of Pure Reason in the natural philosophy of Kant, (5) On the relations of Kant and Newton. Kant's great result, according to the authors, is "that there are in necessary phenomena-that is to say, in experience-no more than these three elements: logical thought, mathematical quantity, and the material datum Der Positivismus vom Tode August Comte's bis auf unsere Tage (1857-1891). Von HERMANN GRtTBER, S.J. Freiburg i. B.: Herder'sche Verlags- handlung, 1891. Pp. viii., 194. Father Gruber here follows up his excellent treatment of Comte's life and work (see MIND, XV. 143) vith a not less noteworthy account of the activity of Comte's disciples, -as well as of the wider movement of</page><page sequence="11">548 NE W BOOKS. modern Positivism in general. The earlier volume gave indications here and there of the later developments of thought now treated at length, but it seemed pretty evident that the author had then his special studies for the present volume still to make. These, as regards the more limited field of - Comtist Positivism, are marked by all the characteristics that so favourably distinguished his account of the master. Nowhere else is so clear and comprehensive a statement to be found of the varied labours and aspirations of the Comtists of all countries and of every sect-from the heterodoxy of Littr6, through the mild orthodoxy of Lafitte with his English and other following, to the strained orthodoxy of Congreve, in turn surpassed by the fanatical devotion of Lemos and other South American hot-heads. It is when the author turns to deal with the larger Positivism (pp. 104-84) that he becomes a less satisfactory guide. Not that here, too, he has not taken manifest pains with some of the more important thinkers (English, French, German, Italian) and succeeded, on the whole, remarkably well in grouping with them the multitude of minor writers. But, interesting as the exposition is and in many ways valuable, it comes short by omission of all attempt to trace the real origins of that general movement of modern philosophic thought to which Comte contributed little more than a very pertinent namie. In the case of particular thinkers, especially German, F. Gruber shows himself well enough aware of the absence of all influence from Comte and presence of other influence (from Kant, &amp;c.); yet the general outcome-or, at least, suggestion-of his inquiry is the more than disputable one, that but for Comte the philo- sophy of the second half of this century wouLld not have taken on that special relation to ernpirical fact which the word ' positive' conveys. And the reason of this becomes more and more clear as one reads on: the Jesuit father has all the time a strictly confessional object in view, which is best served by a predominant reference to Comte's personal pretensions. The object is made plain enough long before he asserts and argues in the " Conclusion " (pp. 185-94) that the true Positivism is that which bases upon the three great "facts " of Theism, Christianity, Catholicism. It is revealed in the rather wild denunciation of this or that" freer positivist " which too often takes the place of serious criticism, and takes it the more unfortunately because the Catholic champion can pass a shrewd enough critical judgment when he keeps cool. He loses hold of himself; however, most of all over the Free-mason, between whom and the Positivist he detects a bond as close as it is sinister. .But, leav- ing all that aside, let it be once more said that the work, in general, has great merits. So much, indeed, and so evidently has the author laboured to get command of his subject, that one feels bound to refrain from drawing attention to particular inaccuracies (of a minor sort) which were hardly to be avoided in dealing with so wide a range of thought and thinkers. Moralphilosophie. Eine wissenschaftliche Darlegung der sittlichen, einschliesslich der rechtlichen Ordnung. Von VICTOR CATHREIN, S.J. Zweiter Band: Besondere Moralphilosophie. Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1891. Pp. xiv., 633. With this second volume, on Special or Applied Moral Philosophy, the author completes: his text-book of Scholastic ethics, of which the General Part was noticed in MIND, xvi. 148. The divisions of the present volume are: Div. I. " The Doctrine of individual Duties and Rights ". Bk. i. " Man in his relation to God "; bk. ii. '.'Man in his relation to himself "; bk. iii. " Of the Personal Relations of men with one another"s</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 549 bk. iv. " Of the right of Property" ; bk. v. " Of Contracts ". Div. II. "The Social Relations of Man, or Doctrine of Society". Bk. i. "The Family bk. ii. " The doctrine of the State " ; bk. iii. " The Law of Nations ". It is the author's aim to continue the treatment of ethics as before on grounds regarded as accessible to natural reason apart from supernatural revelation; but more definite reference is now made at each stage to the idea of the Church as a supernaturally ordained society. The volume has a practical aim in relation-to questions of the day. In connexion with the theory of property there is a long' discussion of Socialism; under the theory of the State the relations between State anid Church' are discussed; and so forth. Polemic with "modern Liberalism'" is of course a conspicuous feature of the discussion of practical questions. Die Bedeutung der theologischen Vorstellungen fuir die Ethik. Von Dr. WILHELM PASZKOWSKI. Berlin: Mayer &amp; Muller, 1891. Pp. vi., 92. A sketch of the mutual influence of religious and ethical conceptions, first in the "nature-religions " (religions of India, Egypt, Persia, Greece, Rome, &amp;c.) and then in the monotheistic religions (Judaism, Mohamnme- danism, Christianity), with some general conclusions as to the relation of the two orders of ideas in the present and future., Religion and morals take their origin, the first from "fear of unknown powers," the second from the social feelings. Soon they begin to influence one another; the gods being regarded to a certain extent as protectors of recognised morals and as having themselves an ethical character. This relation of theological conceptions to ethics does not become perfectly established in any of the " nature-religions," but only in the monotheistic religions, and the religious and moral factors only reach their full harmony in Christianity. In historical Christianity this harmony has not been reached, Christian theological conceptions having been injurious as well as serviceable to morals, Here as elsewhere religion has been gradually moralised by rational criticism of its dogmas, and the process may be expected to go on till Christianity becomes wholly ethical and at the same time compatible with scientific knowledge. Theorie der Cesichtswahrnekmung. Untersuchungen zur physiologisohen Psyehologie und Erkenntnislehre. Von Dr. ENGELBERT LORENZ FISCHER. Mainz: F. Kirchheim, 1891. Pp. xvi., 392. Two former works by the author were noticed in MIND, ix. 161. His present Theory of Visual Perception is on the same lines ; that is to say, it is an attempt at a doctrine consistent at once with Catholic philo- sophical tradition and with modern physiological and psychological science. The book is divided into four sections, treating respectively of four types of theory: i. "Absolute Objectivism or Extreme Realism" (held by some Neo-Scholastics); ii. " The Subjectivism of Modern Physiology" (Helmholtz, &amp;c.); iii. "The Idealism of Modern Philo- sophy" (Descartes, Locke, TBerkeley, Kant, &amp;c.); iv. "Relative Ob- jectivism or Critical Realism " (the author's own view). The first section is very short (pp. 5-24); the fourth, containing the positive doctrine, takes up about half the book (pp. 197-392). The title has been adopted for brevity; the whole, as the author remarks, would be more exactly described as a contribution to the*theory of sense-perception -generally, with special reference to visual perception. The bearing of the psychological on the philosophical problem is clearly conceiveed. In the author's view, "whoever solves the problem of perception has solved the problem of knowledge;'. His own solutioln of both problems is</page><page sequence="13">550 NEW BOOKS. contained in the definition of perception as "the immediate psychical apprehension of an object present to consciousness " (p. 237). He acids) the qualification that we do not -perceive things as they are in them- selves, but as they appear according to the conditions under which we apprehend them sensibly at any particular moment (p. 380). Thus, the objects of sight, for example, are "relative" in that their perception depends on a multitude of conditions outside them; but, though "relative," visual perceptions are not "purely subjective". Geschichte der Philosophie. Von Dr. W. WINDELBAND, Professor an der Universitat Strassburg. Dritte Lieferung. Freiburg i. B.: J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1891. Pp. 257-384. In briefly noticing the second instalment of this work (see MIND, No. 62, p. 295), it seemed doubtful whether the author could complete his task-from where he left off, in the heart of Mediaeval Philosophy- within his originally projected limits; nor has he, in fact, been able to do so. A fourth instalment of " about six sheets " has still to appear before a definitive judgment can be formed on the result of his novel method of treatment by "questions ". The most salient feature of the present instalment is the extension given to " Renascence Philosophy" -carried forward, in a "physica]-science" (after its "humanistic") period, to cover not only Bacon and Hobbes, but also Descartes and Spinoza, and even Leibniz as substantialist. For the present, Prof. Windelband breaks off in the middle of the "Philosophy of the Auf- kld3rung ". Ueber Francis Bacons Formenlehre. Von HANS NATGE, Dr. Phil. Leipzig,. B. G. Teubner, 1891. Pp. 82. A rather elaborate argument for the fundamental position of the doctrine of 'forms' in Bacon's philosophy. Induction, usually regarded as fundamental, derives its whole sense and value from the 'forms'. Form, in Bacon, has a double meaning. It is at once 'essence' or 'concept' and 'law' or 'cauise'. Bacon's conception of law and the modern conception are not precisely the same; but the modern character of his thought is seen in this, that for him the configuration and motion of the ultimate particles of bodies constitute the law and also the form of the quality. At the same time it is not to be forgotten that his thought as well as his terminology was modified by surviving Scholasticism. Ernst Platner als Moralphilosoph utnd sein Verhdltniss zur Kant'schen Ethik. Von PAUL BERGEMANN aus L6wenberg (Schlesien). Halle a. S.: C. A. Kaemmerer &amp; Co., 1891. Pp. 56. An accouijt of the influence of Kant on the Wolffian, or rather Leibnizian, Platner (1744-1818), especially in ethics. The difference between Platner's earlier ethical views, which are mainly those of the German Aufkldrung, and his later views formed under Kantian influence, is shown in detail. Even in his later period he did not accept the Kantian formalism, but still upheld "happiness " as giving content to ethical maxims. His criticisms of Kant, as the author shows, were not wanting in point. Jacob Friedrich Fries als KrUtiker der Kantischen Erkenntnistheorie. Eine Antikritik. Von Dr. HERMANN STRASOSKY. Hamburg u. Leipzig: L. Voss, 1891. Pp. 76. An examination of the modific4tions made by Fries in Kant's theory of knowledge. While rejecting these-whence the study is called an</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 551 "Antikritik " of Fries--the author finds them to be original and stimulat- ing. Remarking on the relation of Fries to Jacobi, he finds that historians of philosophy have taken the- wrong view of it in making the philosophy of Fries a combination of 'positions from Jacobi and Kant. In reality his relation to Jacobi was rather that of a master than of a pupil. Principien der Ethik itnd Religionsphilosophie Lotzes. Von G. VORBRODT. Ein Gedenkblatt zlntn 1. Juli 1891, dem zehnjahrigen Todestage Lotzes. Dessau u. Leipzig: Rich. Kahle, 1891. Pp. vii., 186. An attempt to piit into systematic shape the ethical and religious philosophy which Lotze did not live to expound in his definitive " System of Philosophy ". The divisions of the book are: i. "Ground- questions of theory of knowledge and psychology " (pp. 1-39) ii. " Ex- position of Lotze's ethics " (pp. 39-93); iii. "Exposition of Lotze's religious philosophy " (pp. 93-169) ; with some "Concluding remarks" (pp. 170-183), and a short " Bibliographical Appendix " (pp. 184-6). Ueber Aufqcaben u. Methoden der Psychologie. Von HUGO MEJNSTERBERG. Leipzig: A. Abel, 1891. Pp. 182. This essay has been primsrily issued as pt. ii. (pp. 93-272) of the new series of Schriften der l 1.i,i fur psychologische Forschung, mentioned in MIND, No. 63, p. 442. It is of like notable quality with the, author's Beitrdge. Space has been readily accorded above (pp. 521-34) to a hos- tile critic of Dr. Miinsterberg's psychological work; and, so far as errors or deficiences are made out in it, nothing but gratitude is due from all concermed for the pains so strenuously taken. The writer of these lines, who took on himself the responsibility of signalising the importance and' freshness of the Beitrdge, cannot, however, say that his own first opinion of them is seriously affected by Mr. Titchener's criticism-much as there may be in this which Dr. Muinsterberg would do well to ponder. The. present essay subordinates the question of the Methods to the question of the Problems in a novel and very suggestive way. It is impossible here and now to give even a general indication of the methodological. scheme which the author is thus led to frame, but nobody whose busi- ness is with psychological science at its present stage of advance can afford to overlook the scheme or its setting. Nog Eens: Oorsprong en Grenzen der Kennis. Inwijdingflsrede uitgesproken op 6 October, 1890, bij de Aanvaarding van het Hoogleerarsambt aan de Rijksuniversiteit te Utrecht, door Jhr. Dr. B. H. C. K. VAN DER WIJCK. [Once More: Origin and Limits of Knowledge. Inaugural Lecture delivered 6th October, 1890, on entering upon the office of Professor in the National University of Utrecht by Chevalier Dr. B. H. C. K, VAN DER WIJCK.] Utrecht, 1890. When Prof. Opzoomer, the most eminent contemporary philo- sopher of Holland, was compelled by failing health to retire from the active duties of his chair at Utrecht, it was universally recognised as right and fitting that Prof. Van der Wijck of Groningen, his most faithful and distinguished disciple and follower, should be his successor in the professorship which he had so long adorned. Prof. Van der Wijck's Inaugural Lecture is of itself an adequate justification of his appointment and clear evidence that the great tradition of the chair will be well sustained by its new occupant. But it is also a valuable contri- bution to the discussion of the fundamental philosophical problem of our time, and it deserves on that account to be studied for its own sake. In</page><page sequence="15">552 NEW BOOKS. clear, direct and vivid language the new Utrecht professor discusses again the question of the ()riqin and Limits of Knowvledge, which had formed the subject of his inaugural lecture when entering upon his public career as professor of philosophy at Groningen, a quarter of a century ago. That period of continued study and active teaching has somewhat modified his acceptance of the external empiricism of Opzoomer's original position from which he started; and the interest of the new inaugural lecture lies niainly in the candour and precision with which a maturer and deeper view is stated in it. The general validity of the theory of the 'empirical origin and limitation of knowledge is indeed affirmed anew, and its triumph over mere "idle ideal speculation" is emphasised; but it is admitted at the same time that the principle of experience has been advocated in too external and one-sided a way, and- that it is necessary so far to adopt the principle of the idealist in order to give an adequate explanation of the origin and nature of hunman knowledge. In the progress of philosophy the idealists and the empiricists, formerly at opposite poles, have in fact now come nearer each other. "The con- flict between experience and speculation is settled in principle. On the one side, it is now recognised that our thinking must have the solid ground of facts under it; and, on the other side, it is now recognised that the power of thinking goes continually beyond experience." While empty ideal speculation is to be abandoned, the scientific thinker has at the same time to acknowledge and appreciate the element of knowledge contri- buted by the mind itself through its own percipient and intellectual activity. This is the. form of knowledge, an element which cannot be derived from mere mechanical presentations, or external rnotions, or nmaterial atoms. This formative element inclucles space and time, the principles of connexion, continuity and unity (Kant's foundations of Pure Physics), objective reflexes of the activity and unity of consciousness. Mental Philosophy has really supplied these fuindanmental conceptions to Physical Science; and it has been by their aid, and not by mere simple hid actions, that the great laws of the indestructibility of matter and force, and of their conservation, have been discovered. Biut these formal elements of knowledge are merely relative; they only arise out of, and in connexion with the opposition of subject and object; and they only explain the order of the universe in terms of human thought. The origin of human knowledge is thus fully explained, and at the same time its limits are cletermined. By the aid of such conceptions, and of hypotheses in harmony with them, the range of human knowledge of this kind may be indefinitely enlarged, but its inherent conditions cannot be violated or transcended. There can be no knowledge of an absolutely objective mechanical world of matter or atoms ; and it is idle to attempt to explain our subjective experience by mere material atoms and changes. The reality of objective being is a necessity of thought, but we can only ,construe its nature and relations from our own subjective standpoint. " As we know things ohly through our consciousness, we know them also only in relation to our consciousness. Our kniowledge is so far limited." The significance of all this is obvious. The author himself points out the connexion of his views with those of Kant, Lotze, Fechner, Bain, and Wundt. The Lecture closes with graceful and appropriate references to the relations and circumstances under which it was delivered. It was worthy of -its occasion. [W. H.] ARNOLDI GEULINCX Antwerpensis Opera Philosophicc. Recognovit J. P. N. LAND. Voluinen primum. Hagae Comitum apud Martinum Nijhoff, MDCCCXCI. Pp. xx., 506. This first volume of the collected Qdition of Geulincx's philosophical</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 553 works, announced in Prof. Land's article in MIND, No. 62, contains rather less than was then promised (cp. p. 241); but, between the Qucaestiones quodlibeticae with the first and second academic Orationes on the one hand and the Logica restituta with (previously unpublished) supplementary Dictata on the other, gives yet a very characteristic representation of the mental quality and range of the ill-fated thinker. It is in the second volume, to follow a year hence, if this can cover (besides what still remains to be given of logical import) the Ethica as well as the Meta- physica, that his true measure as a philosopher will admit of being taken and his relations both to later and to earlier thought may be rightly appreciated. Already, however, in the first volume, he is seen to put a serious meaning of his own into the forms of the traditional Logic ; while the lighter pieces, of which Prof. Land's article gave interesting account, show him possessed, with strenuous intellectual purpose, of a brightness of humour which, one would hope, may have helped him the better to bear the reverses of an all too unfortunate life. In editiiig the works now given, Prof. Land has spared no pains of collation, so as to make the long-delayed act of reparation the more complete, and also to make the interior worthy of the fine external setting (after the precise model of the memorial edition of Spinoza's Opp.) to which he has been helped with the balance of the Spinoza fund. The biographical data, which he has been able after Vander Haeghen (see MIND, xiii. 298) to ascertain with pro- bably as much completeness as, in the circumstances of Geulinex's life and end, is now possible, are clearly set out at the beginning; but in place of a portrait (which can never have been taken) we have to be content with three facsimiles of the philosopher's signature. [Occasionn may here be- taken to correct a rnistranslation on p. 240 of Prof. Land's article in No. 62. From line 10, the selntence should run: " They embrace the Annotata praecurrentia and majora to Descartes' Primcijia, with a collection of theses defended under Geulinex's presidency (1690-1),"-the date, so given, being that of publication. The figures " in 1690-1," as they stood, give a false suggestion.] RECEIVED also:- D. Hack Tuke, Pritchard and 8qynmonds, with Chapters on Moral Insanity, Lond., J. &amp; A. Churchill, pp. iv., 116.
