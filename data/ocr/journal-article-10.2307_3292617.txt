<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE C LAS SICAL J 0 U R fAL VOLUME 48 NUMBER 2 NOVEMBER 1952 0 Plautus and the State Gods of Rome T is to be expected that the dramatic literature of a nation will make fre- quent reference to the deity or deities worshiped by the people and that a signi- ficant influence upon religious feelings and beliefs will therefore be exerted by the theater. It is the purpose of this arti- cle to examine the comedies of Plautus with a view to discovering the nature of his allusions to certain gods worshiped at Rome and the possible effect upon the Roman citizen's attitude toward these gods. Since Plautus was widely popular among all classes and his plays not only continued to be performed immediately after his death but were revived at inter- vals for many years,' his influence in such an important field as religion should be a matter of interest. The deities who will figure most promi- nently in this discussion are among those usually designated as Graeco-Roman. Long before the time of Plautus numerous Greek gods and goddesses had found their way to Rome, becoming identified in many cases with native divinities. According to one authority there are twelve great Greek gods who "appear as a closed circle in part under native names, in the cult of Rome," -- Jupiter, June, Neptune, Minerva, Mars, Venus, Apollo, Diana, Vulcan, Vesta, Mercury, and Ceres. Others were introduced at various times, Hercules being one of the earliest and most widely accepted. These divinities were adopted by the state, and their temples, shrines, and worship were in the charge of public officials.2 Since adherence to this state religion was part of a citizen's duty and he could hardly deny the national gods without appearing a traitor, his attitude toward them was manifestly a matter of importance. It should be noted here that the word "religion" in its current sense can hardly be applied to the Roman's feeling for his state deities, since for the ordi- nary citizen these were probably more in the nature of national symbols to be re- vered in perhaps somewhat the same way as our flag. While a certain amount of superstition did center about them, al- most surely the Graeco-Roman gods never inspired the same kind of mystic veneration and fear which the ancient animistic deities had evoked; yet they and their established rites were important ties between the individual and his government. On the highest level this state religion intensified patriotism; in the hands of cynical officials it often became a political tool because the people might more easily be induced to support the government's projects if they were shown that the gods approved.3 Thus it is not surprising that it was the policy of officials and statesmen to ob- serve the prescribed religious rituals even when those rituals were little more than empty routine for the priests them- 49</page><page sequence="2">HAZEL M. TOL LIVER selves,4 and to encourage in the people the closest adherence to the recognized state cult. Nevertheless, as will be seen later, there is reason to admit, even in the time of Plautus, some popular skep- ticism regarding the official gods.5 Any influence which tended to augment this skepticism might well become a disintegrating factor in a state in which there was such close union of government with religion. That Plautus's plays may have been such an influence seems more than probable. Fowler charges Ennius and Plautus with teaching "the ignorant Roman of their day not only to be indif- ferent to his deities, but to laugh at them." While some authorities do not agree with Fowler,6 his view acquires considerable weight when Plautus's open mockery of the Graeco-Roman gods is noted. A survey of his comedies brings to light all degrees of disrespect for the gods: a tendency to reduce them to human level by drawing comparisons be- tween them and mortals; a certain casual, unpremeditated lack of respect, signi- ficant because it indicates a habit of thought; a deliberate attitude of flip- pancy, betrayed by remarks much too frequent to be accidental; intentional disregard for oracles and religious laws, coupled at times with outright defiance. Many of the gods who are thought of as members of the Graeco-Roman hierarchy receive little or no mention in the plays. Much earlier, an increasing tendency to- ward monotheism had begun to convert Jupiter into a supreme deity while the other gods became proportionately less important.7 It is therefore to be expected that Jupiter would be referred to most often. Because of the nature of the plots, however, Venus comes in for a good share of attention, and there is also fre- quent mention of Neptune as the ruler of a domain which the Romans found notoriously treacherous. A few examples will demonstrate Plautus's treatment of the gods. One of the commonest types of comparison in- volving deities occurs when some en- thusiastic lover finds that no creature less than a goddess can rival his be- loved, even though the latter may be a courtesan. Agorastocles, the young man of the Poenulus, is especially addicted to such exaggeration. When he proclaims his love for a girl whom he has never touched and finds his slave incredulous, he argues that there is nothing strange about that because he loves and fears the gods, too, without touching them (vss. 281-282). Probably no particular significance would be attached to this remark alone, since the comparison im- plied is not very specific. But a few lines earlier (vss. 277-278), Agoras- tocles, looking at his sweetheart, has exclaimed fervently that she is the Venus whom he would worship, and he goes further by declaring (vs. 289) that he would rather be loved by the courte- san than by the gods. Perhaps the general word di which he uses instead of an individual name may have softened this challenge to deity; but even the protec- tion of vagueness is abandoned in later lines (vss. 1219-1220) when the youth declares that if he were Jupiter, he would drive Juno away and marry the courtesan. The same idea is repeated in the Truculentus when Diniarchus, em- bracing his mistress, exclaims that his fortune surpasses Jupiter's (vs. 372). Perhaps Philolaches in the Mostellaria is the materialist of the group when, speaking of freeing his mistress, he remarks gloatingly that if he had sacri- ficed an ox to Jupiter with the money he had paid for the girl, he would not have invested it as well (vss. 241-242). Even though the ancients customarily bar- gained with their gods, this is hardly the kind of calculation to be expected of a devout worshiper. The braggart soldier, too, in order to enlarge his own importance, found the gods useful for comparison. In the Miles 50</page><page sequence="3">PLAUTUS AND THE STATE GODS OF ROME Gloriosus (vs. 1265), for example, Pyrgo- polynices claims descent from Venus when he wishes to picture himself as a great lover. Again, in boasting of his extraordinarily long life he asserts that he was born one day later than Jupiter, whereupon his slave immediately points out that it is only because Jupiter is older than Pyrgopolynices by this one day that the latter is not ruling in heaven (vss. 1081-1082). In the same manner Stratophanes in the Truculentus swagger- ingly calls himself Mars when he arrives at the house of his mistress and addres- ses her as Neriene (vs. 515). These boasting warriors, being objects of ridi- cule, could not have been taken very seriously by the spectators. Most of their speeches would have been laughed at and forgotten; but this very fact might have added to the impropriety of com- parisons between these foolish fellows and the gods. In the Captivi (vss. 864-866) Erga- silus, the parasite, calls himself Hegio's Jupiter because he is bringing Hegio good news and hopes to get a meal in payment. For the master of the household to be referred to as Jupiter does not seem to have been uncommon. Lysidamus thus refers to himself in the Casina (vss. 331-337) when he is promising a reward to his bailiff. But his manner is swaggering, and the reward is to be given if the underling helps this Jupiter carry out a vicious scheme to gain ac- cess to a beautiful slave girl. The bailiff himself remains quite unimpressed by his master's appropriation of the god's name and shrewdly remarks that these human Jupiters have a way of dy- ing off and therefore afford no very reli- able protection. The title would ordinarily serve merely to indicate a man's position as head of a household; but Lysidamus' braggadocio and lewdness as well as his henpecked status render it, though it is probably satiric, unsuited to him and insulting to Jupiter. Probably Jupiter never descended much lower in the social scale than he does in the Pseudolus when Calidorus applies the chief god's name to the pimp Ballio (who has made a deceptive pro- mise not to sell Calidorus' sweetheart), and orders the slave Pseudolus to bring some lambs for sacrifice. There is an interesting contrast in manner among the three characters in this scene (vss. 326- 335). Calidorus, completely taken in by Ballio's empty promise, is so delighted that he breaks into exuberant horse-play. Ballio gets a sort of sardonic enjoyment out of this opportunity to trick a member of the social class which looked down upon, even while it used, people of his own profession. Pseudolus ignores his gullible young master and maintains a grimly menacing attitude toward Ballio, who soon realizes that he is notmislead- ing the canny slave. Yet, in spite of the difference in their moods and their social ranks, all three men are equally ready to continue with no qualms the comparison between Ballio and Jupiter. From this brief survey it can be seen that Plautus observed no limitations in these comparisons involving gods. Any character, of whatever social rank or moral caliber, might be likened to a god and the result for the mortal might be anything from honor to ridicule. For the deity, however, the effect was likely to be degrading in greater or less degree. One finds significant instances of in- cidental disregard for the gods and their shrines and worship. An interesting ex- ample is found in the Rudens (vss. 131- 136) in the speech of Daemones, who is apparently a man of at least average piety. He complains that he is always having to furnish water or fire or some kind of vessels for sacrifices at the altar of Venus near his house. His words be- tray a resentment rather unexpected under the circumstances, especially when he adds that he seems to have acquired his vessels and well for Venus and not 51</page><page sequence="4">HAZEL M. TOLLIVER for himself. Apparently Daemones con- sidered it neither a duty nor a privilege to serve the goddess by lending his pos- sessions to her worshipers and did not stand sufficiently in awe of her to re- frain from expressing his feelings. Fur- ther, his words suggest a widespread lack of concern about the welfare and support of the gods, a conclusion sub- stantiated by the priestess of the tem- ple, who explains to the girls seeking refuge with her that no woman is more compassionate than she but that she is extremely poor and can hardly keep alive, especially since she serves Venus at her own expense (vss. 281-283). More significant as linking a state divinity with immoral practices which became ever more widespread at Rome8 are the descriptions in the Poenulus of the temple of Venus as a place where courte- sans for sale or hire are put on exhibi- tion (vss. 191-192, 264-270, 339-340). Flippancy in references to the gods is so frequent in Plautus that audiences must surely have come to expect it in his plays. Probably they accepted as nothingunusual such harmless impudence as that of the cook in the Pseudolus when he boasts of his skill and of the appeal of his dishes: Jupiter, he says, has the odors from these dishes for dinner every day and in case the cook has no opportunity to prepare a meal the god goes to bedwithout dining (vss. 844- 846). There are numerous instances, however, in which mortals presume to speak for the gods. In the Poenulus, for example, a beautiful courtesan announces that she is going to the temple to propi- tiate Venus, to which her lover Agoras- tocles gaily replies that he himself will vouch for Venus, that she is propitious (vs. 334). Later in the same play, after a prayer which Hanno addresses to Jupi- ter, Agorastocles airily remarks (vss. 1191-1193) that he himself, whom Jupiter regards with fear, will see to it that the god grants Hanno's petitions. Trachalio in the Rudens, upon hearing the prayer of two shipwrecked girls, is just as offici- ous with his advice to Venus whom he counsels to grant their requests since he considers them quite fair (vss. 702-704). The deity Hercules comes in for unquali- fied reproach in the Stichus (vs. 395) when the parasite Gelasimus hears that his patron has returned bringing other parasites. This complaint is voiced by Gelasimus in all earnestness; but it, as well as the other four passages to which reference has been made, is obviously intended to supply humor. The numerous lines con- cerning, or addressed to, Neptune are also in large part comedy verging on the slap-stick variety.9 Indeed, the many allusions to the lord of the ocean sug- gest that Neptune had already degener- ated into an early edition of Davy Jones- a creature of superstition not to be mocked when one was actually making a voyage but quite harmless and even an object of fun when one was safe on land. All such impertinent speeches as those mentioned in the last two paragraphs- speeches which offer advice, officious suggestions, and reproaches to the gods- would surely encourage in spectators who heard them frequently a similar habit of flippancy toward deities supposed to hold, officially at least, a position of honor and sanctity. The passages discussed thus far offer examples of irreverence which, though it may be daring, is generally the result of carelessness or light-hearted persiflage. There are characters in Plautus, however, who deliberately disregard religious laws and practices, even to the extent some- times of becoming unpleasantly defiant of the gods. An interesting point here is that these characters are usually repre- sentatives of the lower classes, being most often parasites and pimps. In the Asinaria we find a slave Leonida appar- ently flinging a challenge to Jupiter when in threatening another slave he de- 52</page><page sequence="5">PLAUTUS AND THE STATE GODS OF ROME dares that though Jupiter himself came to plead this slave's cause it would not prevent punishment (vss. 414-416). Here, however, Leonida is acting out a counter- feit scene with the other slave in the attempt to defraud a stranger of money; hence his remarks can hardly be taken as indicative of his real feelings, but they would not be without effect in further accustoming the spectators to irreverences on the stage. Probably little more significance should be attached to the words of Harpax, the messenger of the soldier in the Pseudolus, when he says that he would not trust a cent to Pseudolus though the latter were Jupi- ter's treasurer (vss. 628-629). But the declaration of the pimp Ballio in the same play, that profit comes before re- ligious worship, may be taken as a plain statement of his own sentiments (vss. 265- 269). Pseudolus's ensuing comment to the effect that Ballio is be- littling the gods whom men ought to fear is condemnatory but has somehow a merely dutiful tone without the force of Ballio's emphatic statement. One of the most signal examples of insolence toward the gods is found in the Poenulus (vss. 449-467) where the pimp Lycus describes his retaliation against Venus, whose favor he had been unable to win even with the sacrifice of six lambs, and predicts that the other gods will be less greedy when they learn how he got even with her; he winds up this enlightening account of his re- ligious activities by denouncing as untrustworthy the priest who had pro- phesied misfortune for him. Apparently this is the ultimate perversion of the ancient custom of bargaining with the gods. Of this practice in its acceptable form the fishermen in the Rudens (vs. 305) speak when they suggest worshiping Venus in order that she may graciously help them. There is also in this play a more philosophic expression of the same idea in the speech of Palaestra (vss. 185- 198) after she has been shipwrecked. She asks if such misfortune is her reward for having lived a blameless life without sin against parents or gods and wonders what punishment the guilty will receive if the innocent are so oppressed. Thus while ancient notion of barter between gods and men has here advanced from a literal to an ethical concept, in the case of Lycus of the Poenulus the same idea has degenerated into the lowest formula of exchange - a commercial transaction in which profit alone figures and all thought of homage to a deity is forgotten. Lycus's gloating over his outwitting of Venus reveals not merely that he sacri- fices to her only to gain certain benefits but also that his attitude toward her is exactly what he might be expected to show toward a fellow businessman with whom he was trying to strike a bar- gain. He even presumes to determine for himself just what omens he will accept from Venus. If they are good, he will pay; if not, the goddess can do without sacrificial meat. Lycus continues his sneers at Venus and her priests until he finds that he has been roundly tricked by Agorastocles. At this point we might expect Plautus to have the pimp admit that he had done wrong in thinking he could outwit the goddess. Instead, while he grants rather incidentally that the priests had been right, instead of blaming himself for not having trusted them, he berates them for being so quick to fulfil their bad omens and so slow with good ones (vss. 746- 793). It is clear that he never thinks of them as representatives of a divinity to be honored by men; instead he seems to regard them much as some people regard fortune-tellers today - with a certain amount of superstitious credence but without true respect. Of course, since Lycus is the villain of the play, the spectators would not feel sympathy with him nor would they consciously accept his viewpoint. Still, the whole passage 53</page><page sequence="6">HAZEL M. TOLLIVER could hardly fail to undermine the general respect for Venus, since being the butt of a pimp's ridicule could hardly lend dignity to anyone, man or god. Brutal as Lycus is, Labrax of the Rudens is perhaps the most detestable of all Plautus's pimps. He is completely ruthless in his disregard both of the gods and of the rights and happiness of other people. Although a temple was supposed to be an inviolable place of refuge, Labrax tries (vss. 513- 727) to drag away from the shrine of Venus the two girls he claims as his property and handles the priestess roughly because she wishes to help them. Showing not the least fear of the goddess, he does not hesitate to swear by her altar even when he has no intention of remaining faithful to his oath (vss. 1332-1356). In fact he openly scorns religious laws as he informs Daemones of his determination to regain possession of the girls (vss. 724-727). A little later he reiterates his nefarious purpose, this time extending his chal- lenge to includeJupiter as well as Venus (vss. 783-784); and afterward, when he lays claim to the trunk which has been salvaged from the water, he defies the ruler of gods and men once again (vs. 1361). Labrax is not a comic character. He is a grim, despicable man engaged in the most contemptible of all trades and willing to do any injury to others for the sake of profit. The audience would enjoy the baffling of a villain. But actually, in the end, Labrax is not very severely punished. Although he has defied the gods, violated the sanctity of a temple, and sneered at religious laws in general, he incurs no penalty beyond the loss of one of the girls and a comparatively small sum of money (vss. 1281-1287, 1384-1412). To say the least, then, the example of Labrax could hardly have acted as a deterrent upon any who were inclined to spurn the gods. Some significance should no doubt be attached to the fact that Plautus makes only people of the lowest ranks of soci- ety seriously and maliciously defiant of the gods, although it may be doubted that his reason for following such a policy stemmed from concern for maintaining the people's faith. It is more probable that he was simply increasing the repulsive- ness of his pimps by putting them as completely as possible at variance with the conventions of society. In the long run, their defiance of divine beings and laws probably did much less to destroy the people's loyalty to the state gods than did the flippancies of the young gal- lants and the witticisms of their clever slaves. The Amphitryon has been reserved for individual consideration because there is nothing else like it in extant Roman comedy. The very fact that such a play could be produced suggests that popular respect for the Graeco-Roman gods was running low. Otherwise the chief of these gods could hardly have been portrayed as a creature without dignity or moral princi- ples who went about like a cheap magi- cian using his divine power to help him seduce innocent women. As it would offend the modern sense of fair play to see a mortal - and a heroic mortal at that - struggling helplessly against a deity who by use of his superhuman power took such unfair advantage, so very likely would the Roman have felt injustice in the relations between Jupi- ter and Amphitryon. Further, in view of the fact that Alcmena is represented as a paragon of virtue, it would seem wholly natural for the early Roman, with his ideal of strict morality for matrons, to disapprove of Jupiter's manner of deceiving her. There is a good deal of irony in Mercury's indignation when Sosia somewhat disrespectfully re- marks, in exclaiming about the unusual length of the night, that Sol must be drunk and asleep (vss. 279-286). Yet Sosia has every right to think, as Mer- cury accuses him of thinking, that the 54</page><page sequence="7">PLAUTUS AND THE STATE GODS OF ROME gods are no better than himself; this the audiencewould doubtless have perceived, since its sympathy would probably have been with the mystified slave rather than with the censured gods. The mere fact that Mercury, who is Sosia's counterpart throughout the play, actually resents the slave's suspicions adds to the ridicule with which Plautus surrounds the two gods. It is true that mythology had long pic- tured Jupiter as appearing in changed form to maidens with whom he fell in love. Further, it must be recognized that an anthropomorphic god does not inspire in the human being the same attitude that a more remote spiritual deity creates. A god who looks and acts like a mortal can logically expect to be judged more or less according to human standards. Still the mere fact that he is thought of as possessing superhuman powers sets a limit to man's audacity in dealing with him. Though mythology, legend, and tragedy had recounted the quarrels, loves, and moral laxities of the gods, such ac- counts had generally been characterized by a certain tone of dignity and respect, not by the flippancy and derision so often apparent in the fabulae palliatae.?' Whatever may have been the individual reaction to the Amphityron among the spectators - whether it was mere care- less enjoyment, cynical amusement, re- sentment, disgust, or shock - the total effect must have been decreased regard for Jupiter and Mercury. A human being is unlikely to maintain for long his con- fidence in a god not superior to himself. If Jupiter took on, in the common mind, the aspect of a cheating philanderer and Mercury the semblance of a tricky slave, they were certainly no longer superior to mortals; in fact they were placed on a level with character types far from ad- mirable. Sosia in his bafflement arouses amusement; Amphitryon and Alcmena, both of high integrity, win sympathy; but Jupiter and Mercury are neither humorous nor honorable - they are cheap tricksters with moral standards far below those of the human characters (vss. 506-507, 510- 511). They openly regard their divi- nity as sufficient justification for any fault; at no point do they betray the least sense of the responsibility inherent in godship except in agreeing that Alcmena must not be left to bear the blame for Jupiter's acts' (vss. 492-495, 869-872). If it is argued that after all this is a farce and serious moral considerations are not expected, then should it not fur- ther be contended that the state gods, who must in the common mind have been connected in some degree with moral standards," do not belong in such a play? It remains to call attention more syste- matically than has yet been done to the types of characters who lend their voices to conscious or unconscious maligning of the gods. Except for the ill-natured de- fiance which, as has been noticed, was usually put in the mouths of characters of the lowest social and moral types, class distinctions make no difference in religious attitude. Without an exhaustive check, the names of characters repre- senting seven stock types in more than half of Plautus' extant plays can be listed. Among the slaves who in some manner make light of the gods are Sosia (Amphitryon), Leonida (Asinaria), Olym- pio (Casina), Palestrio (Miles Gloriosus), Tranio (Mostellaria), Pseudolus (Pseudo- lus), and Trachalio (Rudens). Since by nature the Plautine slave was a voluble, mischief-loving trickster, it might be argued that no great reverence should be expected from him. The young men of the plays, however, supposedly represent the upper social stratum; yet we find belittl- ing the gods by their pert remarks Philo- laches (Mostellaria), Agorastocles (Poe- nulus), Calidorus (Pseudolus), and Dini- archus (Truculentus). If there is any group from which we would surely expect mouth worship, it is the fathers of these young men, the old men, who are presum- 55</page><page sequence="8">HAZEL M. TOLLIVER ably the pillars of society; yet Daemones (Rudens), Lysidamus (Casina), and Theopropides (Mostellaria) all betray at one time or another a lack of the proper respect for some god. Soldiers who bring ridicule upon the gods are Pyrgopoly- nices (Miles Gloriosus), Harpax (Pseudo- lus), and Stratophanes (Truculentus). Among others of those who at times treat the gods with scant ceremony are the parasites Ergasilus (Captivi), Gelasimus (Stichus), and Saturio (Persa); the pimps Lycus (Poenulus), Ballio (Pseudolus), and Labrax (Rudens); the courtesans Adelphasium (Poenulus) and Ampelisca (Rudens). Among miscellaneous charac- ters who indulge in levity at the expense of some divinity are a cook in the Pseudolus, a swindler in the Trinummus, and Charmides, the friend of the pimp Labrax in the Rudens. A better cross- section of society could harldy be found. It would be unreasonable, therefore, to discount the pernicious influence of these comments on the score that the characters who spoke them represented some unimportant or despised class of society. It should be pointed out that Plautus does at times show proper reverence for deity. The whole tone of the Captivi suggests something near veneration for certain frequently mentioned but unidenti- fied di, and the slave Tyndarus asserts the existence of a god who hears and sees the activities of men and who re- wards the good and punishes the wicked (vss. 313-315). In other Plautine come- dies there are passages which endow certain characters with sincere reverence for Graeco-Roman gods specifically.12 Such an attitude occasionally expressed, however, cannot counteract the effects of the many lines which in one way or another belittle the gods. One who feels genuine respect for a god does not deli- berately challenge divine anger by skep- ticism at any time. Plautus' feeling cannot, therefore, be determined by weighing his reverent against his irrev- erent remarks,13 nor is it justifiable to conclude that a theater audience con- sisting of individuals who truly honored the stage gods would complacently accept whatever unfavorable comments a play- wright might choose to make about those gods so long as he was careful to in- clude some lines which showed the cor- rect regard. Indeed, Plautus' very irrev- erence bears witness to that skepticism regarding the Graeco-Roman gods which has already been mentioned as probably current in his time. It seems unlikely that people as vehement in their expressionof approval and disapproval as were the spectators in the Roman theater would have countenanced his disrespectful treatment of their state gods if their own loyalty had not begun to weaken. Drama both reflects and foreshadows social change. Frequently it is somewhat in advance of public thinking; and, because the attitudes of characters in drama in- evitably affect the thinking of spectators who see these attitudes portrayed re- peatedly, the theater may insensibly move its audiences further in a direction in which they are already tentatively faced. Hence, if the Romans were al- ready growing skeptical, the irreverence in the Plautine plays more than any other aspect could be expected to affect their attitude toward the state gods. Plautus had probably learned that his bold and unrestrained jollity at divine expense intrigued his audiences, and his obvious enjoyment of his own impious levities suggests that he himself had no great respect for the gods of his city. It is therefore not surprising if he gave more thought to the success of his plays than to their consequences for the state religion, and there was apparently noth- ing to prevent hiswriting as he pleased.15 There seem to have been no laws under which the subject-matter of playt could be censored except, of course, those which forbade the mention of individuals 56</page><page sequence="9">PLAUTUS AND THE STATE GODS OF ROME by name."6 Since, however, the state controlled stage productions, it might be argued that any play which seemed likely to weaken public fealty to the state gods would have been banned. This argument fails to take politics into account. Most plays in republican Rome were directly in charge of the aediles, whose advance- ment in office was so closely linked with the magnificence and popular appeal of the games they gave that they often con- tributed enormous sums from their own pockets to assure the success of those games.'7 These aediles are thought to have selected and bought, either per- sonally or through agents, the plays to. be produced.'8 If there was any power of censorship, it apparently rested in their hands. In view of the amount of money spent on the entertainments, it would seem natural for them to choose the type of comedy which experience had shown would hold the greatest popular appeal and so garner the most votes for the sponsor in his next race for office. It is verypossible that these politicians some- times lacked the insight to envision the possible influence upon society and the state of such attitudes as that displayed by Plautus toward the gods. Politicians are not always noted for their foresight or indeed for their willingness to sacri- fice their personal interests for the good of the nation. Hence, even if more thoughtful persons entertained some mis- givings as to the effect the Plautine dramas might have upon the vitality of the state religion, the aediles may well have ignored this whole question when selecting their plays. In conclusion, then, examination has revealed the flippancy and general lack of respect which characterize many of Plautus' allusions to the state gods. It is obviously impossible to measure ac- curately the influence exerted by lines spoken from the stage or to speak with a high degree of assurance about public at- titudes in so remote a period. Neverthe- less, as Augustus's nostalgic efforts to revitalize the divinities of Rome prove, serious deterioration of the religion which had been so important a bond be- tween the individual citizen and his government did occur; and it is reason- able to believe, on the basis of the evi- dence uncovered within the plays, that Plautus and perhaps some other writers of fabulae palliatae contributed material- ly, with their irreverent witticisms and shameless travesties, to the gradual weakening of public loyalty to the state gods.
