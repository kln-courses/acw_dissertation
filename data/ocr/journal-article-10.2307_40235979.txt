<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philip Hardie The Janas Episode in Ovid's Fasti Ovid's treatment of Janus on thè Kalends of January is the first and also the longest épisode in thè Fasti. It follows a formal prologue introducing the whole poem, but it should be no sur- prise to find that this first in the temporal séquence of days also has an initiatory function for the rest of the year, offering pat- terns for the poet's présentation of himself and of his subject matter1. Beginnings set expectations; as Janus says himself (1, 178) omina principiis ... inesse soient. This inaugural function may be compared with that of the first narrative complex of the Aeneid, following the prologue of 1, 1-33, the Storm with its conséquences on earth and heaven concluding with the Speech of Jupiter; this is a passage (1, 34-296) of comparable length to Ovid's Janus épisode and which lays out the central thèmes and structures against which we will read the rest of the epic2 - and which concludes with allusion to the future closing of the Tem- ple of Janus. The analogy with the Aeneid is not gratuitous, for taken together thè Fasti and the Métamorphoses represent Ovid's typically indirect answer to the challenge of Virgil's epic, on the one hand a Callimachean elegy on the central subjects of the Aeneid and on the other a hexameter epic on thèmes for the most part not Roman. Such a description of the Fasti conforms with the distinctions implied by Propertius in his announce- ment of a project of Roman aetiological poetry in 4, 1 : in the first part of this poem (1-70) a tension between the slender re- sources of the Callimachean poet and thè grand pretensions of his Roman subject, a tension which in the second part, the 1.

These distinctions are, not surprisingly, made programmatically explicit by Ovid at several points in the Fasti, especially at the beginning of books two and four; in less overt ways they also inform the Janus épisode. I shall begin with a reading of Janus that focuses on the Ro- man thèmes that are suitably offered to the dedicatee Germani- cus in his capacity of imperator. As motto for this reading we could take the penultimate couplet of Propertius' proud prom- ise in the first half of 4, 1, lines 67-8 Roma, fatte, tibi surgit opus, date candida dues I omina, et inceptis dextera cantet auis. In successive reprises I shall complicate this reading; it will appear that a certain duplicity lies at the heart of what Ovid is about hère. To ease référence I attach an analysis of the structure of the Janus épisode: Fasti 1, 63-288 63-88 Invocation of Janus; hymn on processus consularis 89-288 Interview of Ovid with Janus: 89-98 Epiphany of Janus A 99-144 Cosmology i) 99-114 Janus the god of Chaos and cosmogony ii) 115-144 {quaesitae causa altera formae) Janus the cosmic door-keeper and universal regulator Β 145-183 Beginnings i) 145-164 Year begins at mid-winter, not in spring ii) 165-170 Token beginning of work on 1 January iii) 171-174 Offerings made first to Janus iv) 175-183 laeta uerba spoken on 1 January C 184-286 Roman History i) 184-226 Strenae: paupertas of primitive Rome/luxury and greed of présent day ii) 227-54 The as: rule of Saturn and Janus on site of Rome iii) 255-76 Aition of temple of Janus Geminus: Titus Tatius and the boiling Springs iv) 277 '-86 Janus closed in peace; triumph of Germanicus 287-8 Closing prayer to Janus</page><page sequence="3">Janus in Ovid's Fasti 49 1. Rome: A First Reading of Janus The Ovidian Janus épisode conforms to a pattern that struc- tures a wide range of Augustan texts including thè Aeneid, namely an encompassing view of history that culminâtes in thè universal extension of thè pax Augusta, with a strong sense of thè sympathy between politicai and cosmological order3. In- deed thè detailed parallels with thè Aeneid that I shall describe allow us to take Ovid's Janus as a gloss on this kind of reading of VirgiPs epic. After thè opening invocation to Janus (1, 63-70), Ovid trans- ports us to thè centre of thè city of Rome as spectators of thè processus consularis on thè Kalends of January. The new consuls move up to thè Capitol, whence Jupiter looks forth on a world entirely Roman (79-88). From line 89 to thè end at 288, Ovid narrâtes a question and answer session between the poet and the god, which, as well as providing us with information about Janus himself, in effect functions as an aition for the preceding sketch of Rome at the centre and at her limits. Janus' first speech, 101-44, is an answer to Ovid's question «why do y ou hâve two faces?», and is a mixture of physics and mythological theology. In 101-14 Janus claims to be a kind of embodiment of cosmogony itself, originally Chaos (first etymology of Janus, from biare, calqued on the Greek etymology of Χάος from χάσκει/ν) but now metamorphosed into an almost perfect speci- men of anthropomorphic divinity - almost, were it not for his two faces, a trace of the original disorder in nature, which we may feel that he brushes aside a little too lightly (113 confusae quondam nota parua figurae). In 115-44 cosmic history is suc- ceeded by a synchronie picture of universal order; Janus the celestial doorkeeper présides over the regulär processes of na- ture viewed in the image of an orderly coming and going (second etymology of Janus, from ire). At 125 the Roman god of doors is associated with the Homeric Horai who keep the gâtes of Olympus. The Horai are very suitable companions for Ovid's Janus, for in Greek thought they corne to symbolize the regulär and harmonious order of both thè naturai and the socio-political worlds. In our text that move from thè naturai to 3. This was a central subject of my VirgiVs Aeneid: Cosmos and Imperium, Ox- ford 1986.</page><page sequence="4">50 Philip Hardie thè human has already been quietly made in thè preceding lines 121-4, thè first mention of Janus' spécifie job as keeper of thè doors of peace and war. As god of peace Janus is suitably paired with thè fiorai, whose Hesiodic names are Eunomie, Dike&gt; and Eirene (Theog. 902); mitis is thè epithet both of thè Horae in 125 and of Pax at 1, 712. The transition from cosmological to politicai is eased by thè possibility of taking peace and war here as a version of thè Empedoclean cosmic principles of Love and Strife4 - not thè only piace in thè Fasti or Métamorphoses where Empedoclean influence is détectable. Indeed thè monstrous Mischwesen that come into being at certain stages in thè Empe- doclean cosmic cycle include créatures 'with two faces and two breasts' (DK Β 61)5. Janus as gaoler of War may remind us also of that other doorkeeper at thè beginning of thè Aeneid, Aeolus: note especially Aeneid 1, 62-3 regemque dedit quifoe- dere certo I et premere et laxas sciret dare iussus habenas. The description of Aeolus introduces thè épisode of thè storm and its aftermath, a séquence that ends with thè Speech of Jupiter to Venus, concluding with thè prophecy of thè closing of thè Gates of War (or Janus) and thè imprisonment of Furor in lan- guage that strongly echoes thè opening description of Aeolus and thè confined winds. From 147 to 183 Ovid asks a séries of questions that in one way or other have to do with thè notion of beginning; why does thè year begin in winter and not in spring6, why do people make a token start on their profession or craft on thè Kalends of January, why are offerings first made to Janus, why are words of good omen uttered. At 185 Ovid asks about thè stre- 4. 123 totus miscebitur orbis suggests confusion on a more than human scale; cf.

Pascal, Graecia Capta, Florence 1905, 129-51; Borner on Fasti 1, 103. 6. The passage is problematic: the contrast between 148 pauca locutus and 161 quaesieram multis has suggested to some the mark of incomplete revision; and the eephrasis of spring seems disproportionate for the context. Is Ovid making a point that this is not going to be a poem beginning in spring, as Lucretius' and VirgiPs didactic poems do (and the first âge of the world in the Met. after the process of création is vernai, 1, 107)?</page><page sequence="5">Janus in Ovid' s Fasti 51 nae, New Year's gifts of dates, figs, honey, and of small coins; Janus now begins a séries of answers that take us into the his- torical and moral world of Rome. The answer to the question of why coins are given as présents is the occasion for Ovid to introduce what will be one of the central structuring features of the poem, the contrast between the primitive and the contem- porary Rome7; Ovid also points to the process of growth by which past and présent are linked, 209-12. In Janus' answers to the remaining three questions we leap over stepping stones from very remote past to the présent day: A) 229-254. In answer to the question of the meaning of the figure of a ship on the ancient a$y Janus tells how Saturn came by ship to Latium at the time when Janus himself ruled on the Janiculum in a Gol- den Age of Justice and Peace. B) 255-276. Explaining the reason for the location of the temple of Janus Geminus, Janus tells how he foiled the attempt of Titus Tatius to capture the Capi- tol, betrayed by Tarpeia, by suddenly opening Springs of boil- ing sulphurous water. C) 277-282. Janus tells why his temple is open in time of war and closed in time of peace. Janus then skips from the time of Romulus to A.D. 17 with the assurance that under the Caesars he will long be shut. Janus lifts his eyes to survey a world pacified by Rome, 283-6, repeat- ing Jupiter's survey at 85-6; the latest, and presumably last, triumph is that of Germanicus. We end as we begun with another procession to the Capitol. In the time of Saturn Janus had told us (253) nil mihi cum bello; under Tiberius we thus return to thè Saturnia regna, though it must be admitted a very différent Golden Age from that described by Janus at 221-4 . With this last part of the Janus épisode, from 185 to the end, compare Aeneid 8, a book that brings us in stages from the Latian rule of Saturn down to the triple triumph of Octavian9; and for the final juxtaposition of the Romulean defence of the Capitol, an épisode which suggests an alternative, historical, 7. On the 'hour-glass' effect of this concentration on very early and very récent Roman history see A. Wallace-Hadrill, Time for Augustus: Ovid, Augustus and the Fasti, in M. Whitby et al. (edd.), Homo Viator, Bristol 1987, 221-30, at 226. 8. Cf. Ars Amatoria 2, 277 aurea sunt nere nunc saeculd; 3, 113 simplicitas rudis ante fuit; nunc aurea Roma est. 9.

Thus, if we leave aside the 'interlude on beginnings' at 147- 183, Janus gives us the very Virgilian combination of cosmic history followed by Roman history12. It should be noted that the figure of Janus itself did not inevitably cali for such a treat- ment; while it is true that the association of Janus with peace was central to thè Augustan revival of interest in the god, as Borner says 'das Bild des Ianus ... hat ... nirgendwo auch nur die geringste Berührung mit der Idee des augusteischen ewigen Rom'13. The séquence of the Janus épisode is also an outline in miniature of the plan of the Métamorphoses, prima ...ab origine mundi ...ad mea tempora14. The Métamorphoses and Fasti seem often deliberately to play off against each other15: the cosmogo- nies of Fasti 1 and Métamorphoses 1 hâve many points of con- io. See J.-C. Richard, Pax, Concordia et la religion off ideile de Janus à la fin de L· république romaine ; «Mèi. Écol. franc. Rome» 75, 1963, 303-86, at 369 ff. 11. Hardie (η. 3) 351. Simylus, the writer of Greek aetiological elegy on Roman thèmes, transfers the story of Tarpeia to the time of the Gallic attack on the Capi- tol, ap. Plut. Romul. 17 (the problem being that the Vestals were an institution of Numa). 12. The pattern is also found in the speech of Polyhymnia at 5, 11-52, a création account ending with a picture of contemporary Rome, the consulship and the triumph, the institutions that open and close the Janus épisode. There is a closer connection between the présent épisode and the Muses prologue to 5, both being modelled on the Callimachean interview with the Muses in Aitia 1 and 2. (See A. Barchiesi, Discordant Muses, forthcoming in «Proc. Cambr. Philol. Soc.»). 13. P. Ovidius Naso. Die Fasten, vol. 1, Heidelberg 1957, 18-19. 14. A. Barchiesi points out that tempora is thè first word of thè Fasti. 15. S. Hinds, The Metamorphosis of Persephone, Cambridge 1987, 42 f. I collect some of the most striking parallels: Fasti 1, 111: cf. Met. 1, 6-7 unus [!] erat toto naturae uultus in orbe, I quem dixere Chaos, rudis indigestaque moles-, Fasti 1, 105-7: Met. 1, 21-5 litem ... concordi pace (Janus is god of peace); Fasti 1, 112: Met. 1, 33 sectamque in membra coegit (Janus may be seen as a personification of the macranthropic model of thè universe); Fasti 1, 121-4: Met. 1, 57-60 discordia fra- trum, winds might tear apart the world (and behind both passages lie the Virgilian winds of Aeolus); Fasti 1, 111-12: Met. 1, 83-8 création of man in effigiem mod-</page><page sequence="7">Janus in Ovid's Fasti 53 tact, and it is intriguing that the first informant of thè Fasti is indeed a god of metamorphosis. There may be a further allusive relationship between the last two unes of the Janus épisode and the concluding séquence of the Métamorphoses. The former concludes (287-8) lane, fac aeternos pacem pacisque ministros, I neue suumy praesta, deserat auctor opus. The prayer that con- cludes the narrative of the Métamorphoses asks for a long life for Augustus (15, 868-70), and there follows the sphragis in which Ovid looks forward to thè eternai life that his poem will enjoy (871-9 iamque opus exegi ...). Who is the auctor and what is thè opus of Fasti 1, 288: Germanicus and his work of peace, blessed by Janus, or Ovid and his work of writing up the calen- dar? Are we meant to reach a final answer?16 In this way it turns out that Janus, the god of beginnings, is also the god of endings: Ianus habet finem (2, 1). This peculiar- ly Roman god (1, 90) watches ο ver the 'end of history' as the immémorial processes of naturai and historical change corne up against the buffers of Roman universal triumph. It ail seems a bit too easy : the god who opens and shuts doors off ers the poet instant devices to open and close an épisode. Start off by calling on the god to unlock the temples, 70 resera nutu candida tem- pla tuo, and allow him to take his leave by literally shutting up, 282 Caesareoque diu numine clusus ero17. The sensé of an ending is reinforced by the conclusion of book one, the anniversary of the dedication of the Ara Pacis on the 30th of January, with a renewed hymn to Pax (709-22). The verbal erantum cuncta deorum; 87-8 sic modo quae fuerat rudis et sine imagine tellus I induit ignotas hominum conuersa figuras (in fact Janus evolves into the image of man, the reverse of thè more usuai création of man in the image of god); Fasti 1, 221-4: Met. 1, 89 ff. Ages of Metals; Fasti 1, 195 amor habendi: Met. 1, 131. 16. B. Harries (n. 1) 169 takes 288 to refer to the poet; Borner and Frazer take it to refer to Germanicus. For concluding prayers on behalf of the poet cf. the prayer that ends the Flora épisode, 5, 377-8 floreat ut toto carmen Nasonis in aeuo, I sparge, precor, donis pectora nostra tuis (modelled on Callim. Aet. 7, 13 f.); 5, 109- 10 gratta Pieridum nobis aequaliter adsit, I nulhque laudetur plusue minusue mibi, ending an épisode parallel to the Janus épisode (see n. 12 above). 17. The trick was observed and imitated by Statius in Silvae 4, 1, which opens, 1-2, laeta bis octonis accedit purpura f astis I Caesans insignemque aperit Germani- cus annum; the bulk of the poem is taken up with a speech by Janus which ends, 44, sic Ianus, clausoque libens se poste recepii. The choice of the title Germanicus for Domitian also coïncides fortunately with Ovid's address to his Germanicus.</page><page sequence="8">54 Philip Hardie echoes here of thè beginning and end of thè Janus épisode18 will be the more pertinent if Torelli is correct in arguing that thè design of the Ara Pacis, a rectangular precinct with a doorway at each end, alludes to the form of the temple of Janus Geminus19. Yet there lurks the thought that he who closes may at some point in the future open again, and that 'small sign' of former chaos cannot be put from our minds. I will return by différent routes to the question of how two-f aced Janus r e a 1 1 y is. 2. The Poet I now return to the opening of the épisode to draw out ways in which the thèmes of imperiai ideology outlined above are accommodated within the particular kind of poem that Ovid has chosen to write; it is after all not an Aeneid. The first two Unes, 63-4, set up a dichotomy crucial for Ovid's way of deal- ing with his subject: ecce tibi faustum, Germanice, nuntiat annum I inque meo primus carminé Ianus adest. Janus is intro- duced in a double rôle: firstly he heralds a lucky year20 for y ou, Germanicus; and secondly he is the first to appear in my, Ovid's, song21. Carmen and annus are a pair that we find again in the first line of book two, Ianus habet finem. cum cannine crescit et annus: I alter ut hic mensis, sic liber alter eat12. Given 18. Another kletic prayer {ades 67, 712); 712 Pax, ades et toto mitis in orbe mane.

The subordination of elegiac poet to Germanicus the Roman statesman is perhaps further signalled by the fact that the hexameter is reserved for the latter, the pentameter for the former. 22. Other passages implying the duality and comparability of carmen and annus: 1, 723-4 sed iampnma mei pars est exacta labons, I cumque suo finem mense libellus habet; 1, 25-6 si licet etfas esty uates rege uatis babenas, I auspice te felix totus ut annus eat (Germanicus as both statesmen and poet is a conveniently pivotai figure); 6, 21 uates Romani conditor anni (where the Propertian pun on condere 'found (a city)', 'compose (a poem)' (Prop. 4, 1, 72: see. C. Mcleod, Collected Essays, Oxford 1983, 205) is transferred to the 'establishing of or 'writing about' the Roman year.</page><page sequence="9">Janus in Ovid's Fasti 55 his subject matter Ovid has created for himself the possibility of an unusually close convergence between that subject and the fictional progress of the writing23; the path of the year is also the path of the poem (no in médias res hère), the twelve books corresponding exactly to the divisions of the year in the world outside the poem. The narrative of thè Fasti plays on the con- vergence between the time of the Roman year and the time of thè poet's narrating or enunciating. But equally the annus and the carmen are not one and thè same, and in thè gap between them may enter Ovid thè Callimachean, thè poet who is under no obligation to be the slave of time or of the times. Let us now see how this freedom is exploited in this first, and therefore exemplary24, day of the year. In the lines immediately preced- ing the introduction of Janus, the couplet 61-2 concludes gener- ai prefatory material on the différent types of day found in the calendar, fasti, nefasti, etc.: haec mihi dicta semel, totis haeren- tiaf astis, I ne seriem rerum scindere cogar, erunt. Hère the con- trast between dicta and rerum corresponds to that between car- men and annus in the next couplet: words of thè poet that must be got out of the way lest they intrude on the séries rerum, the continuity of the year. In other words what Ovid is intent on is another perpetuum carmen, but like the Métamorphoses this poem will be continuous in one respect but not in others: it faithfully follows the séquence of the Roman calendar, but as Mary Beard says of the Roman religious year 'there was no main narrative thread linking one festival and the next&gt;25.

The first word of the first hexameter of the Janus épisode, ecce&gt; minimizes the distance between word and event, as does also the last word of the pentameter, adest. Inque meo primus cannine: in the context the poet's private Carmen is not in fact easy to distinguish from more public carmina: Ovid's choice of starting-point coïncides with the prescription of Roman state religion that prayers and hymns begin with Janus, for example the carmen Saliare26. So we look forward to the kind of car- men that a vates might sing, and we will not be disappointed when Ovid at 65 immediately launches into the language of formal prayer, invoking the god by name, followed by various epithets, anaphora of dexter ades, etc. The god is to attend a very public occasion, the opening of the Roman year, with the procession of new consuls up to the Capitol. This is not in fact an occasion ritually associated with Janus, but it is particularly appropriate for the beginning of thè Fasti, for the year is of course named by the consuls, and fasti may be used as a virtual synonym for consuUtus. The Capitoline Fasti, the füllest list of Republican consuls, originally adorned the Parthian arch of Augustus, it has been suggested because the arcus is also a ianus27. In this section on the new consuls (and also at points later in the Janus passage), as well as drawing on the language of the hymn, Ovid also rehearses some of the topoi of another very public genre, the panegyric delivered on the inauguration of a new consul: the new-born sun, the securing of peace, the return of Iustitia, good omens28. It is all very Republican in feel, and this may be another example of Ovid's tailoring of his poem to the professed Republicanism of Tiberius that Elaine 26. G.

There is no mention of thè various acts of loyalty to the emperor that took place on the Kalends of January; in A.D. 15 Tiberius refused to allow the customary oath to uphold his acta. At 71 Ovid turns to address the bystanders; at 75 he descri- bes the well-omened blazing-up of the sacrificial fires. The tone is still solemn, but the ground has shifted slightly; we are now into the kind of 'dramatic hymn' beloved of Callimachus and his followers30. The distancing has begun; cognizant of the Cal- limachean overlay we wonder whether 74 differ opus, liuida lingua, tuumly is really just a variation offauete linguis addres- sed to the Roman people, or whether it is also an appeal to give this poem a fair hearing as it gets under way, the deprecation of Livor, Φθόνος, or Βασκανιη31. One may again point to the ope- ning of Propertius 4, 6 for the mingling of sacerdotal and poe- tic; Callimachus' second Hymn also comes to mind again, pointing to Janus' displacement of the Callimachean Apollo as the initiatory god of this aetiological poem. This section ends with the hymnic salue of 87-8, according to Bömer the only elegiac example apart from Propertius 4,9,71. Such greetings normally hâve as their addressee a god or hero, not a day as here32.

One might see the Kalends</page><page sequence="12">58 Philip Hardie phrasing suggests thè religious όστις ποτ' ει formula33; but thè question is in fact the pivot for a turn away f rom ritual mimesis to scholarly aetiology . The tone changes abruptly. In 85-6 we hâve the picture of Jupiter looking out from the Capitol (or perhaps from his throne in the sky - arce sua is not un- ambiguous35) at a world which contains nothing that is not Ro- man. In such a world is the poet not being a little disloyal when in 89-90 he gives as reason for his puzzlement over the nature of Janus the fact that 'Greece has no divinity like you'? A stan- dard question of the Roman antiquarian, to be sure, but is this an odd way to begin the explication of the Roman year? At 93 we move from présent tenses and direct addresses to the tenses of a past narrative (in which we will remain right up to 285-6 pax erat ... tradiderat ... Rhenus aquas, moving back to présent imperatives only in the concluding couplet with its prayer to Janus at 287-8). What we hâve is an alternative epiphany to that implied at 67 ff . : Ovid tells how he was granted a waking vision of the god not in a temple or other public place, but in the privacy of his own study (94 domus); a stränge light illumines the domuSy as the blazing altars had lit up the aether and tem- ples at 75ff. Ovid's rôle is now not that of priest but of poet taking up his writing tablets. Many hâve noted thè similari ty between Janus' appearance to thè poet and that of Apollo to Callimachus 'when I first put my writing tablet on my knee'36; but structurally the epiphany of Janus corresponds rather to the of January as the natalis of the year: the resulting combination of birthday poem and triumph poem is comparable with Tibullus 1, 7 (see F. Cairns, Genenc Com- position in Greek and Roman Poetry, Edinburgh 1972, 167-9. 33. Eur.

Because of the exiguous dimensions of fragment two of the Aetia, it is impos- sible to know whether Ovid alludes in détail to the beginning of the Muses' conversation with Callimachus. One word, howe- ver, is shared: Chaos, mentioned by Callimachus as the begin- ning of thè story told on Helicon to Hesiod by the Muses, and claimed by the Ovidian Janus as his ancient identity. Hesiodic allusion is already présent in the words with which Janus ad- dresses Ovid, 101 (= 3, 177) uates operose dierum: Ovid is 'the bard who works on days . Martin West thinks that the title Έργα και Ήμέραι is very likely at least as old as Callimachus' Pinakes; the Latin équivalent seems to be concealed in Georgics 1, 276-7 ipsa dies alios alio dedit ordine luna I felicis operum39. In operosus the 'work', the subject-matter of Hesiod's didactic poem40, has been transformed into the πόνος of the Alexandrian poet; the whole phrase acknowledges Callimachus through the latter's own poetic ancestor. At this point we are deep in Ovid's own Carmen and a long way from the public world of the Ro- man annus. The Hesiodic model may extend even further: the explana- tions of Janus fall into three groups, A) cosmology and cosmo- 37. Also the model for the interview with the Muses at the beginning of Fasti 5. Harnes (n. 1) 169 n. 25, notes the striking replacement of a Greek god of poetic inspiration with the Roman Janus. He refers to Horace's parody of the Calli- machean scene at Satires 1, 10, 31-5, where Quirinus appears in order to instruct the poet, but does not consider it a real précèdent for Ovid. But there may be a closer link, given the fact that Quirinus is one of the titles of Janus, and the one particular- ly favoured by Augustus. 38. The genitive after operosus is unusual, perhaps on the analogy of the metrical- ly équivalent Studiosus, which would of course not have conveyed the Hesiodic allusion (unless dierum is governed directly by uates). 39. See R. F. Thomas ad loc. 40. Janus' first word, disce, functions as a generic signal (cf. Medie. 1). Janus re- places the Hesiodic and Callimachean Muses: he carries a baculum with which might be compared the σκήπτρον given to Hesiod by the Muses. With inque meo primus cannine cf. Hes. Tbeog. 34 σφάς δ' αύτας πρώτον τε καί ΰστατον αΐέν αείδειν. Barchiesi makes the further point that this poem is a 'Days' without 'Works', being concerned chiefly with holidays.</page><page sequence="14">60 Philip Hardie gony (99-144); Β) a miscellany of answers on the thème of be- ginnings (145-83); C) answers on Roman history and cultural history (184-286). To A) corresponds the Theogony, to C), if less immediately, the Works and Daysy which includes an ex- planation of the need to work in the présent day through a mythological cultural history, the Myth of the Ages of Métal (a myth strongly implicit in Janus' account of the early history of Rome). The Muses prologue to the Aitia contains allusions to both works of Hesiod, and in line 6 Lobel suspected a référence to the myth of the Golden Age. 3. Janus: a second reading I turn now to a second examination of Janus himself . Striking juxtapositions of the grand and the trivial, the awesome and the laughable we hâve ail been taught to recognise as a central fea- ture of Callimachean art. Janus is a very suitable candidate for this kind of représentation. His first appearance strikes wonder and fear into the poet (95-8), but he is later a god of laughter (191, cf. 129). He is indeed a contradictory blend of the sublime and the ridiculous: coextensive with the évolution of thè uni- verse itself from chaos to order, an image whose rude material is nothing less than matter itself, by a variation of the olim trun- cus er am topos (with the further twist that this is nota statue, but thè god himself)41; supreme guardian of the cosmic order and keeper of Jupiter (126), and himself described in language appropriate for the father of the gods (119-20, 283-4); but, for all that, just a door-keeper with the stick and key entrusted to that servile office42. High-minded guardian of peace in primi- tive times and guarantor of thè return of those times under the Caesars, but not shy of a sneaking admiration for the luxury of the présent day. The door-keeper thème is introduced surrepti- tiously in 70 resera nutu candida terapia tuo^ with the sugges- tion of supernatural action at a distance, magical Türöffnung; at 1 18 Janus admits to a manual {manu) performance of his duties. 41. Cf. Prop. 4, 2, 59 stipes acernus eram (Vertumnus, a god and a poem closely related to Ovid's Janus). 42. The two aspects of Ovid's Janus correspond closely to thè two sides in the continuing debate over the origins of the god: minor god of doors, or faded great deity of the heavens. See Frazer on Fasti 1, 89; Börtzler (η. 5) 108f.</page><page sequence="15">Janus in Ovid's Fasti 61 The next couplet, 119-20, suggests at once the grand and the humble: custodia mundi, certainly, but custos is also uox propria for the humble ianitor; ius uertendi cardinis, where cardo may be either thè axle of thè universe or the hinge of a door. Janus spells out thè concrete détails of doors and door-keeping at 135-40: his function in thè caelestis aula is precisely that of the human ianitor seated by thè door. In this, thè first simile of the poem, heaven is brought down to earth. The direction of the comparison is that of the first similes of the Aeneid (1, 148-53, Neptune compared to a human statesmen) and of the Méta- morphoses (1, 200-5, outrage on Olympus compared to the shock feit on earth at the assassination of Caesar). The latter is indeed the first formai simile of the Métamorphoses, but it is preceded by a comparison, in another form, that is even closer to Fasti 1, 137-40, in the description of the house of Jupiter, 175-6 hic locus est, quem, si uerbis audacia detur, I haud timeam magni dixisse Palatia caeli, There is no explicit mention of a ianitor, but that office will presumably not be unmanned at the doors of the great gods, 171-2 dextra laeuaque deorum I atria nobilium ualuis celebrantur apertis43. Hère we will not wish to drive too thick a Heinzian wedge between the registers of the Métamorphoses and thè Fasti. But we may also cast a glance in the other direction, to Ovid's erotic elegy. Ovid expli- citly raises the issue of the élévation of pretension between his elegiac works on love and his poem on Roman and impérial thèmes at the beginning of book two and of book four. The topics of thè recusatio are hardly raised in thè generai prologue of book one (with the exception of 13 Caesaris arma canant alii: nos Caesaris aras); but can we read through the Janus epi- 43. Palatia caeli contains a play on the Ennian phrase caeli palatum (Cic. Nat. Deor. 2, 49: see Pease ad loc); that palatum may mean 'sky' as well as 'roof of the mouth' suggests further links between the passages in the Métamorphoses and the Fasti, especially in the light of Varro's discussion of Janus (Aug. Civ. Dei 7, 8 = Varrò Rer. Div. fr. 232 Cardauns): duas eum fades ante et retro habere dicunty quod hiatus noster, cum os aperimusy mundo similis uideatur; unde et palatum Graeci ούρανόν appellarti et nonnulli inquit [Varrò] poetae Latini caelum uocauerunt paUtum, a quo hiatu oris et foras esse aditum ad dentés uersus et intro- rsus adfauces; see Ahi (η. 22) 86-7. Possibly relevant also is Virg. Aen. 10, 5 con- sidunt tectis bipatentibus, on which Servius comments: physice dixit. nam caelum patet ab ortu et occasu. est autem sermo Ennianus (Ann. 52 Skutsch), tractus ab ostiiSy quae ex utraque parte aperiuntur.</page><page sequence="16">62 Philip Hardie sode and not think of that typically elegiac target of abuse in thè AmoreSy thè ianitor of 1, 6, a slave whom thè desperate lover is reduced to addressing as if he were a god?44 I conclude with some more generai thoughts about thè dual- ity of Janus' form and float thè possibility that he is thereby a doubly appropriate god for thè opening of thè Fasti: not just thè god of thè Roman New Year, but a figure who symbolizes dichotomies at thè heart of Ovid's poem. An approach of this sort has already been adumbrated by C. Martin, in an article that focuses on 'thè contrast between thè often arbitrary, obscure conceptualizations by which man Orders his existence, and thè eternai regularity of thè stars', a contrast of which Janus is taken as symbol, being 'both a guardian of divine boundaries and a symbol of arbritrary, chaotic form'. I am not altogether convinced by this assessment of the function of the astronomic- al parts of thè Fasti, but the question of the figurative signifi- cance of Janus' biformity is worth posing. Let me draw together my own list of dichotomies: there is the division be- tween Roman year and Ovidian poem; the fact that Janus turns out to be not only a god of beginnings, but also of the ending of Roman history (in so far as history is defined as process rather than thè mere passage of time); as a being of remote antiquity Janus spans thè gap between the primitive history of Rome and the realities of the présent day, the temporal division inhérent in the whole project of writing aetiological poetry46; then there is the opposition between the grandly cosmic and the servilely and humorously domestic rôles of Janus, exemplary for many other épisodes in the poem; the conflict between the officiai view of the new âge of peace, implicitly a return to the virtues of the Age of Saturn, and Janus' complaisant acceptance of the 44. McKeown on Am. 1, 6, 3 f., 15 f., 27. McKeown takesfulmen in line 16 as having as one of its meanings the otherwise unattested 'doorbolt' (strongly sup- ported by McKeown's note on 28 fulta); alternatively (or concurrently) it might mean baculum, one of the attributes of a door-keeper (and of Janus). This would cohere more closely with the Scipios = fulmina belli pun; the name Scipio was first borne by a Cornelius who acted as a baculum to his father (Macr. Sat. 1, 6, 26). 45. C.

We return to that confusae quondam nota parua figurae (113), which rather breath-takingly shrugs off the most striking characteristic of the god as if it were an insignificant birth-mark. What happens when you actually talk to Janus? How many voices do vou hear? Ovid is rather coy, where his imitator Statius is unambiguous, 5. 4, 1, 12-13 attollit uultus et utroque a limine grates I lanus agit; 15-16 leuat ecce supinas I bine atque inde manus geminaque haec uoce profatur47 . At Fasti 1, 100 Janus begins to speak, edidit hos nobis ore priore sonos, 'the front mouth' (though even this is ambiguous, as ore priore could be taken as a variant of thè more usuai prior ore4S, 'speak- ing before (me)', Ovid having been struck speechless with fear (cf. Met. 8, 521 ore supremo). Poetic plurals may also raise suspicions when the subject is two-headed: 255-6 presserat ora deus. tune sic ego nostra résolut I uoce mea uoees elidente dei. And what of that invocatory anaphora at 67-9 dexter ades ... dexter ades ...? Most striking, perhaps, is 115 acape quaesitae quae causa sit altera formae: thè doubling (and more) of causes is one of the most typical features of this kind of antiquarian aetiology (though not, if our sample is représentative, ail that common in Callimachus49), and Ovid frequently gives us two or more explanations50. A typical example is the account of the Agonalia at 1, 317 ff., where Ovid does express a préférence (332). Elsewhere he does not; where antiquity or obscurity ren- der certainty impossible it is no surprise to find the human in- vestigator contenting himself with merely listing possibilities. Furthermore récent historians hâve stressed that the multiplic- ity of competing explanations is indeed called for by the rules of this kind of exegetical game, without leading to a sensé of inadequacy or frustration. But it is surprising that a god of ori- gins, indeed the original god himself, should simply give two explanations with no expression of préférence. He, if anyone, should be in a position to say. Nor is it possible to argue that in 47. Coleman on 12 'a pair of hands on each side'; on attollit uultus Ίη Ovidian style, the apparently «poetic» plural is hère a true one'. 48. E.g.

Finally, Janus' equivocation may be a deliberate reversai of a Callimachean model: the first aition after the Muses prologue concerned the Charités, and in the course of the épisode the poet Callimachus presented three alternative accounts of the parentage of the Grâces, to have his quandary resolved by the Muse Kleio. We have seen how Ovid replaces the Callimachean Muses with Janus as his informant in the first épisode of his poem; Janus' refusai to give straight answers is thus the more surprising51. It is now a commonplace move of criticism of the Méta- morphoses to suggest that the subject of the poem is also one of its main artistic principles; does the god whose two faces intro- duce Ovid's poem on the Roman Year ask of us a bifocal read- ing of thè Fasti}52 Magdalene College, Cambridge 51. Janus also gives contradictory reasons for the closing of his temple: at 123-4 it is to keep war shut up, while at 281 it is to keep peace from leaving. 52. This is a revised and expanded version of a paper presented to the Laurence Seminar on Ovid's Fasti held in Cambridge in May and June 1990; my understand- ing of thè Fasti owes much to the participants in thè Seminar.</page></plain_text>
