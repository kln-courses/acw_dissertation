This paper claims this inspiration was double - affecting both Cassirer's philosophical anthropology and Cassirer's epistemology of biology, but in two rather different ways. Thus, the paper intends to shed light on a corner of the history of the development of German thought of the interwar period. It may also have an actual interest because both Cassirer and Uexklill enjoy, for the time being and each in their way, a renaissance, e.g. in the recent field of biosemiotics. Keywords Cassirer • Uexklill • Epistemology • Anthropology • Biology • Biosemiotics 1 Introduction It is a well-known fact that Ernst Cassirer was influenced by his colleague, the biolo- gist Jakob von Uexklill at the University of Hamburg: references to Uexklill may be found scattered throughout Cassirer's mature work, beginning from around 1928 until his death in 1945.1 But what did this influence amount to? The point I want to make in this paper is that this influence was two-fold - affecting both Cassirer's philosophical anthropology and Cassirer's epistemology of biology, but in two rather different ways. 1 As indicated in van Heusden (2001). The extended second version of Uexküll's Theoretische Biologie came out in 1928; thus, it is possible that Cassirer's knowledge of him is prompted by his reading of that book. Cassirer later also refers to Umwelt und Innenwelt der Thiere (1909) as well as Die Lebenslehre (1930). F.

More specifically, the nascent discpline of biosemiotics, studying the use of signs in biology, being inspired especially by Uexküll but also to some extent by Cassirer, and might profit from a clarification of the interrelations between their doctrines. It should immediately be said that the evident course of influence between the two seems to be primarily one-way, from the older Uexkiill to the younger Cassirer, even if an influence the other way around can of course not be precluded.2 Both of them were professors at the young University of Hamburg during overlapping periods. The university was founded only in 1919 by the first democratically elected city council in Hamburg (with a social democrat majority) and emphasized interdisciplinarity, made possible by cooperations with, e.g., Aby Warburg's famous Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek and A.M. Bartholdy's Institut für Auswärtige Politik. The University of Hamburg quickly rose to international fame during its short flowering period in the Weimar years until the Nazi takeover in 1933. Cassirer was a philosophy professor in exactly that period, from 1919 to 1933, serving as rector in 1929-1930 (being the first Jew in German university history to occupy such a position), and the older Uexkiill enjoyed a late recognition as a professor from 1925 to 1940, from 1926 on presiding over his own innovative Institut für Umweltsforschung. The parting of their ways is obvious: as a Jew, Cassirer fled Germany already in the spring of 1933, briefly after the Machtergreifung , to pursue a career in exile, taking him to England, Sweden, and the USA, while Uexküll's ambiguous or complicated relation to Nazism is less well understood and probably not even sufficiently researched to this day. These political sides of their carreers may be indicated by the comparison of their doctrines in political science: Cassirer's posthumous The Myth of the State (1946) is an unraveling of the philosophical origins of Nazism and provides an analysis of the ressurrection of myth as a decisive force in mid- twentieth century politics, while Uexküll's Staatsbiologie (1933, an extended second edition of the 1921 original) is a political scientific sketch 2 The only reference I have found concerning Uexküll's relation to Cassirer stems from Uexküll's widow, Gudrun von Uexküll, who in her biography of her late husband records two incidents connecting the two men. The first relates how Uexküll gave a lecture, apparently in the early 1930s, on how dogs take everything within their smelling field as their property. Cassirer is said to have been in the audience and remarked that Rousseau's saying, that the first man claiming private property should have been killed, now ought to be extended to dogs (von Uexküll 1964, p. 168). The second, more interesting, anecdote relates how Uexküll protested over Cassirer's fleeing from Hamburg in early 1933. Gudrun von Uexküll makes, not surprisingly, a point about her husband's opposition to Nazism. What he did, according to her, was to write a letter in May 1933 to Eva Chamberlain, the widow of the racist ideologist Houston Stewart Chamberlain. According to Gudrun von Uexküll, her husband's idea was that this letter should reach Hitler, based on the close relation between the Führer and the Chamberlains. In this letter, Uexküll complained that Chamberlain's "ideal- ism" was being converted into the "most brutal materialism" in contemporary German politics (von Uexküll 1964, p. 171), and took Cassirer as an example. He ended the letter by encouraging Ms. Chamberlain to go to Hitler and make her influence felt (von Uexküll 1964, p. 173). Uexküll's own general anti-Semitism, however, seems to be well-established, and the reconstruction of his precise points of view on this issue and their development over his career merits a whole separate investigation into which we can not here go any further. Cassirer's biography, written by his widow, Toni Cassirer (1981), does not mention Uexküll. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">Synthese (2011) 179:169-186 171 built on the metaphor of the state as an organism, and in some respects it amounts to little but a fascist theory of state. Philosophically speaking, both of the two are Kantians, if in rather different ways. Cassirer, of course, was the "professional" Kantian, biographer and publisher of Kant, who erected the whole of his own philosophy on a sophisticated elaboration of the Marburger neo-Kantianism of Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp. Uexkíill, on the other hand, was rather a sort of self-made Kantian, less well- versed in the body of Kant's writings, but with an original Kant interpretation which is both fertile and problematic. We might schematically say that while Cassirer is an epistemologizing neo-Kantian with strong objectivist tendencies, Uexküll is a naturalizing Kantian with strong sub- jectivist leanings - a sort of interesting chiasm to be explained in further detail. Uexküll explicitly attempted to generalize Kant's philosophy from its basis in the faculties of the human mind in two related directions: (1) by extrapolation to the body, taking the bodily Bauplan (organization) and its anatomy and physiology to play an important role in the shaping of the mind inhabiting that body, thus making him a forerunner of the embodiment trends in current philosophy; and (2) by extrapolation to other kinds of living beings, taking each animal species to possess a specifically formed environment, an Umwelt (surrounding world), determined by its specific Bau- plan and the possibility it yields for classes of perceptions and actions. Seen from his point of view, an obvious meeting point with Cassirer might be the construction of a complexity ladder of Umwelten in different species (just like Cassirer contemplates a complexity ladder in the unfolding of symbolic forms in cultural development). As an anti-Darwinist, Uexküll vacillated, however, with respect to the feasibility of con- structing such a ladder - his romantic vitalist tendency rather predisposed him to see each animal's Umwelt as a monadic phenomenon sui generis. Cassirer also worked to generalize Kant's doctrine, but in quite another direction: taking his point of departure from the neo-Kantian core discipline of epistemology, of theory of science, he maintained that Kant's idea of the constitutive role of mind should be extrapolated to cover all other fields of human intellectual activity, language, myth, science, art, technology, as is evident in Cassirer's well-known general notion of "symbolic forms". These different cultural devices should be grasped as different means of world constructing, parallel to that of science. His Enlightenment conten- tion that science constituted the highest and most explicit of such devices made him immune, however, to relativism, and in much of his work objectivism plays a strong role, leading him to the idea that philosophy must constantly survey all special sci- ences, from physics to history of art, in order to track the crucial conceptual innovations in the ongoing objectification process of human thought. Cassirer himself struggled to achieve such an overview over the special sciences of his day, with remarkable success, and it is probably not too much to say that he, as a polyhistor, was second to very few minds in his period. A meeting point with Uexküll is that the simplest human symbolic forms, according to Cassirer, are the always emotional expressions (Ausdrücke) which are shared with higher animals - only in turn systematized by man in myth. Only the next step in cultural development, representation ( Darstellung ), creates independent objects by means of the subject-predicate distinction inherent in language, and only the final step, pure meaning ( reine Bedeutung) takes the decisive anti-metaphysical â Springer</page><page sequence="4">172 Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 step beyond language, in dissolving the metaphysical distinction between subject and predicate in order to leave behind only functional relations between entities. Cassirer's references to Uexküll are to be found especially in two different loci, one a discussion of philosophical anthropology, using Uexküll 's biology as a contrast, another a discussion of the epistemology of biology. 2 Uexküll in Cassirer's philosophical anthropology The former Uexküll influence has its first and major appearance in the outlines of a fourth volume of Philosophie der symbolischen Formen , originally written around 1928 and published only recently. The existing texts from that project fall in two cate- gories. One is a large, finished essay on the metaphysics of symbolic forms, originally meant to figure as a closing essay in vol. 3; the second is a bundle of notes using the conceptual apparatus outlined in the first three volumes of the Philosophie der sym- bolischen Formen (1923-1929) in a piece of contemporary philosophical criticism. The essay opens this discussion with a sharp, polemical opposition between Geist and Leben , as a preface to the outline of a philosophical anthropology set out to bridge this opposition. In the notes, Cassirer's overall idea was to go into further detail with a criticism of the then current and politically influential fads of vitalism (Bergson, Scheler, Klages, Heidegger, et al.), based on the contrast to his own brand of philo- sophical anthropology and his doctrine of symbolic forms.3 Here, the references to Uexküll thus function to provide a biological contrast to his own basic understand- ing of man - and, in turn, to function as an argument against the anti-Enlightenment vitalists who tend to make mere animal being a sort of Utopian state for man to pur- sue. Man is thus, by contrast, the animal symbolicum. The same use of Uexküll, as the biologist providing decisive arguments for the contrast between man and animal, recurs in Cassirer's attempt at a systematic methodological philosophy in his Ziele und Wege der Wirklichkeitserkenntnis ( Goals and Directions of the Cognition of Reality, written around 1940, only recently published in Cassirer (1999)), as well as in his American recapitulation of the doctrine of symbolic forms under the title An Essay on Man , written at Yale during his exile to be published in 1944. Let us investigate Cassirer's argument in the planned parts of the fourth volume of Philosophie der symbolischen Formen. As a Kantian, Cassirer turns against the monist idea taking meanings to develop continuously from natural beings. A central human artefact like tools presuppose the existence of possible objects (detached, in turn, from their correlative subjects). Hence, the Umwelt of man can not be constructed on the basis of the Bauplan of human anatomy, unlike the case in animals whose Umwelten are exactly so defined:4 "Tools can arise only where the mind has become capable 3 It should be remarked in passing that this critique of different philosophies of life is extremely well- executed and possesses an acute incisiveness even today, and Cassirer's arguments may easily be repeated against various brands of (de-)constructivism and other current irrationalisms. 4 See Cassirer ( 1 995b, p. 43, 1996, p. 41 ) - the first reference is to the German original, the second to the English translation. Uexküll was no standard Watson-Skinner behaviourist, but his conception of Umwelt has strong behaviourist features. The Umwelt of a species should be constructed, not on the basis of any empathy with animal minds, but on meticulous studies of animal physiology and behaviour, charting which Springer</page><page sequence="5">Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 173 of conceiving of a 'possible' object instead of giving itself over directly to a real one and losing itself in it."5 While the animal is locked, in direct perception-action chains, to certain aspects of reality, aspects functioning as "signals" only, never as objects, man is able to step back and contemplate - and indeed constitute - worldly objects at a creative distance. Man is so to speak driven out of the paradise of Umwelt with its close-knit perception-action circuits and he is thus condemned to build his own Umwelt , which he may do because he is " der Form fähig ", he is "capable of form".6 Thus, there is a sharp contrast, no continuity, between Geist and Natur - quite on the contrary, Geist must use nature as a contrast in order to obtain understanding of itself (as against the irrationalisms of Bergson and Driesch recommending different ways of circumventing, or even abolishing, mind in order to reach back into a natural state) - while the world of the animal remains pre-mythical, pre-linguistic, and pre- theoretical. Only through an " Abbau " (dismantling)7 of the symbolic forms used in reality construction, may we hope to reach the "genuine and original metal of reality".8 Thus, unlike man, animals do not have objects. Cassirer quotes an example from the biologist Hans Volkelt concerning a spider catching a fly, able to recognize its prey only when it lies struggling and shaking, caught in the net, and not at all able to recognize it when presented to it as a freshly killed but quiet specimen.9 The fly as an object in itself does not exist for the spider. Thus animals, by contrast, only have " Reizketten " - chains of emotional stimuli - and hence they may never entertain any relation between pure objects and a pure ego as required in Kant.10 Animals thus live in the present "now" only (what Cassirer's despised Lebensphilosophen considered a Utopian state for man to pursue), and this implies that the animal Umwelt forms an impenetrable shell around the animal, quite unlike the plastic and malleable human Umwelt , subject to ongoing further elaboration, investigation, and construction.1 1 Footnote 4 continued phenomena the animal in question is able to perceive, and which phenomena it is able to act upon. The result is the "functional circle" of that animal defining its Umwelt by the set of interlinked perception-signs and action-signs relating it to its surroundings. 5 Cassirer (1995b, p. 41, 1996, p. 40). 6 Cassirer (1995b, p. 46, 1996, p. 44). 7 Cassirer (1995b, p. 64, 1996, p. 52). * Cassirer ( 1 995b, p. 5 1 , 1 996, p. 49). Cassirer's notion of symbolic forms is interesting in that the whole set of cultural devices, of course, function as so many tools of world construction, yet science seems to play a special, enlightened role, because in addition to all this building of symbolic constructs, science adds the possibility of analyzing them through a process of " Abbau " making humans conscious of their own symbolic form use, thus enabling them to emancipate themselves from arbitrary constraints in those sym- bolic forms. This is how we must interpret Cassirer's rendering of the tension between the symbolic forms of myth, language, art etc. on the one hand, and science on the other - in a classical Enlightenment stance placing science as that which may penetrate more cloudy symbolic forms. But the appearance of language and art as means of representation seems to play a similar critical role with respect to myth - so maybe an enlightenment framework (we dare not say "dialectics") is constantly working within the development of symbolic forms. 9 Cassirer (1995b, p. 65, 1996, p. 63). 10 Cassirer (1995b, p. 64, 1996, p. 62). 1 1 Cassirer ( 1 995b, p. 7 1 , 1 996, p. 69). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">174 Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 In these lines of argument, Cassirer takes over Uexküll's preference for using prim- itive animals as prototypes for animals as such - obviously because his argumentative interest is contrastive and dualist. Even if animals and man alike do in fact have Ausdrücke , unlike human beings animals have no possibility for synthesizing them into a mythical world view. Thus, while man from there undertakes the whole cul- tural development of symbolical forms, there is no analogous biological evolution of such forms. Man erects his own counterworld ( Gegenwelt ) by turning from mere an-sich-Sein to fiir-sich-Sein ,12 from states to objects, meanings, and states-of- affairs - gradually das Tun (act) of man becomes more and more saturated with mental forms ( geistigen Formen). Man is thus estranged or alienated from immediate being, but at the same time this alienation is a price worth paying for the enlightenment and emancipation process unfolding in culture. And for this reason, the dreams of the vitalists of a return to immediacy are not only impossible but decidedly reac- tionary. Funnily enough, from UexkUH's far right-wing position it is equally tempt- ing to thus emphasise the difference between immediate animal being and alienated man in this fashion, but with a completely opposite aim: to highlight the tragedy of man being estranged from his natural state by the ever-growing thicket of inter- mediary constructions of culture and technology, so as to form a pessimist, conser- vative version mirroring Cassirer's enlightened optimism. While Uexklill sees the openness and indefiniteness of human culture as a dark destiny taking man still further away from his paradisic embeddedness in nature, Cassirer celebrates it as the emancipation of man from finite, brute animal being into the infinity of ideal forms. Even if the two of them thus hold completely opposite views of the animal- man relation, they focus on the same underlying structure: both of them empha- size the difference between man and animal, and thus prefer very simple animals as prototypes for animals as such.13 One of Uexküll's favourite examples is that of the tick, whose Umwelt consists of the perception signs of butylic acid (a sign of mammal sweat), heat (a sign of the thinness of the skin of its host), and the action signs of dropping, possibly to hit upon a passing mammal, crawling to the thinnest skin location, biting and sucking blood to become able to procreate by par- thenogenesis. In such an Umwelt , perception and action signs are extremely closely linked with a minimum degree of interpretational variability. The generalization of this example permits Uexklill to maintain his claim that all animal Umwelten basi- cally possess the same character of tightness and closure - and it permits Cassir- er, in turn, to inherit the same sharp distinction between animal closure and human openness. 12 Cassirer (1995b, p. 61, 1996, p. 59). 13 At the end of the thirties, Cassirer attempted to write a systematic companion to the three domain-based volumes of Philosophie der symbolischen Formen (on language, myth, and science, respectively) which should, as the title indicates, focus on different methodological ways of approaching reality. The notes have been published as Ziele und Wege der Wirklichkeitserkenntnis. It is interesting to see that even if written almost simultaneously with the fourth and last volume of Cassirer's impressive history of epistemology, The Problem of Knowledge, with its completely different application of Uexkiill, Ziele und Wege der Wir- klichkeitserkenntnis remains in exactly the same interpretative tradition as we just discussed: Uexkiill as biologist providing contrast material to philosophical anthropology. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="7">Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 175 It is interesting, however, that here, in the very beginning of his being influ- enced by Uexkiill, Cassirer, as honest as he is, does in fact admit the existence of a specific problem arising in the face of the abilities of higher animals: "The totality of these achievements can in no way simply be read off from mankind's "organization" (Bauplan), such as from the organization of the brain and the ner- vous system. Uexkiill conducted his research primarily in the area of the lower ani- mals, and from the results that he attained he inferred the general schema that he termed the "functional circi ъ" (Funktionskreis) of living creatures."14 So Cassirer per- fectly realizes the danger in generalizing too far on the basis of very simple ani- mals, because their fixed function circuit tends to unravel in higher animals: "The closed nature of this 'functional circle', this interrelation of 'noticing' and 'effect- ing', appears to loosen up the more we approach the human world until finally, in this world, even the bond that otherwise everywhere defines the unity of the organism seems to be broken."15 This is the only place Cassirer approaches the issue of the evolution of the specific human openness via intermediate degrees of openness in higher animals, giving rise to the striking observation: "Hence, if we say of higher animals that they use their eyes, we must say of the pilgrim scal- lop that the eyes use the animal"16 - the lack of objects correlates with the lack of subject in simple animals, while both tend to emerge in higher animals. The con- stitution of an I and an object are thus interdependent, and object consciousness and self-consciousness necessarily appear together. What characterizes higher ani- mals is that, in them, sensory and motor systems are no longer completely inde- pendent, so that the sensory system becomes able to know about the actions of the motor system, forming a feedback loop facilitating the "reflective relationship [...] according to which every higher creature 'is' a body and at the same time 'has' a body of its own."17 After these early admissions in his very first discus- sion of Uexkiill, Cassirer seemingly forgets the problem because the closed nature of animal Umwelt fits his dualism so well. In the 1940 Ziele und Wege der Wir- klichkeitserkenntnis, he thus approaches the same issue much more sceptically: "In the evaluation of the singular phenomena, e.g., the so-called 'performance of intel- ligence' [Intelligenzleistungen] of the higher species of animals, this limit [between mere expressions and representations] often appears to be more fluid and controver- sial."18 And already in the planned fourth volume of Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen , these interesting ideas are bracketed in order to emphasise its conclusion of a sharp distinction between mere animal action circles and human " Gesichtskre- ise ", between the Kantian duality of Nature and Freedom with which the essay ends. 14 Cassirer (1995b, p. 43, 1996, p. 41). 15 Cassirer (1995b, p. 44, 1996, p. 42). 16 Cassirer (1995b, p. 63, 1996, p. 61). 17 Cassirer (1995b, p. 65, 1996, p. 63). We quote Cassirer's admissions about these issues, also because they show that an evolutionary account for the emergence of Umwelt openness in the animal kingdom is not necessarily prohibited in his thought. 18 Cassirer (1999, p. 145) - translation by the editors. â Springer</page><page sequence="8">176 Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 3 Uexküll in Cassirer's epistemology of biology The other central locus for Uexküll references in Cassirer has a very different character and occurs in his magisterial history of epistemology from the seventeenth century to the present day, the enormous Das Erkenntnisproblem in die Philosophie und Wissen- schaft der neueren Zeit , whose fourth volume was written in 1940. The 100-page second book of that volume, with the title " Das Erkenntnisideal der Biologie und seine Wandlungen " ("The Ideal of Knowledge in Biology and Its Transformations") contains Cassirer's impressive account of the epistemology of biology. Similar to Cassirer's first treatment of Uexküll, this discussion of Uexküll's epistemology of biology occurs in Cassirer's late period, simultaneously, in fact, with one of the works displaying that first use {Ziele und Wege der Wirklichkeitserkenntnis). Nevertheless, Uexküll plays a different role - in this discussion, he is taken up as the one who safeguards sound elements of vitalism in a brand of organicism functioning as the Aufhebung , the mediation, of the tension between simplifying mechanicism and mys- tifying vitalism. Uexküll is fitted into a picture of the epistemological landscape of biology in the early twentieth century with the zoologist and philosopher Hans Driesch as the radically vitalist counterfigure. The confrontation between the two takes place towards the end of Cassirer's large treatise on biological epistemology, in which he briefly charts the development of modern biology from its philosophical roots in Kant's Kritik der Urteilskraft and Goethe's plant morphology to the idealist morphologists of early nineteenth century. These developments are confronted with the rise of Darwin- ism and the theory of evolution, the causalist attempts at constructing a "developmental mechanics", and terminates in the Vitalismusstreit of the early twentieth century where vitalists like Driesch and Uexküll take up new sorts of vitalism against Darwinism. Cassirer's overall aim is, of course, not only historical: his interest in the history of sci- ence is guided by a philosophical interest, namely to subject the concepts produced in the development of the sciences to a philosophical, purifying critique in order to bring forth which valid symbolic forms have in fact been produced in and through that scien- tific development. In the case of biology, the final part of the presentation takes up the debate over vitalism in order to resolve it and further the discussion. Cassirer's overall aim is to find a mediate position between purely causal-mechanical Darwinism, on the one hand, and its vitalist, teleological opponents, on the other hand. To him, the vitalists are right in attacking Darwinism for overlooking the irreducible specificity of biological concepts like organism, inner causes, self-organization, anatomy, etc. which may never be reduced to mechanical concepts only. Conversely, the Darwinists are equally right in attacking vitalists for assuming the existence of mystical forces with- out any empirical or positive basis at all. In Cassirer's mediation attempt, Uexküll's special version of vitalism plays a conciliatory role as opposed to the more radical vitalism of Hans Driesch. Driesch was, of course, the main proponent of vitalism in the debate over vitalism that broke out once more in the biological theorizing of the interwar period. The proponents of vitalism found encouragement in the philosophy of Henri Bergson and other philosophical vitalists. Driesch was notoriously known for his assumption of special, yet unknown forces being responsible for the specificity of biology, as expressed in concepts like "soul", "entelechy" and "psychoid". These non-spatio-temporal forces Driesch suggested inhabit all living beings. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="9">Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 177 Cassirer takes care to present the basics of Driesch's viewpoint by comparing them to his predecessor Wilhelm Roux and his idea of an "Entwicklungsmechanik ". Roux was, in his own self-understanding, a material reductionist, but Cassirer' s ingenious analysis of his position brings to light its inner contradictions. Roux's account of embryogenesis involves a reinterpretation of Aristotle's concept of dynamis , of poten- tiality: The animal has an " Anlage ", a disposition, determining its typical growth, and on the basis of this idea, Roux demands that this growth is described in functional terms referring to a whole series of self-determinations and self-organizations, "Auto- Ergasien ", performed by the organism. The determination of such self-government is possible only because it is based on Roux's fundamental distinction between inner and outer causes working on the organism, and the very description of embryogenesis is deemed impossible without such concepts. Contrary to Roux's own idea, however, Cassirer points to the fact that no purely mechanical reason for the distinction between outer causes and inner, self-organizing causes can be given. Thus, Roux's idea of a "causal morphology" as a substitute for the tradition of "idealist morphology" is sim- ply a contradictio in adjecto , Cassirer argues.19 Driesch's basic idea is to build on and improve the inheritance from Roux. He realizes, just as Cassirer does, that the very idea of a "developmental mechanics" does in fact embrace incompatible ele- ments. Driesch's overall strategy to cope with this discovery is to posit a metaphysical dualism, separating in two realms what was confusedly mixed together in Roux. In addition to mechanical causes, a primary teleology must therefore be assumed. Dri- esch's experiments showed that even very severe spatial distortions of embryos had no serious effect on their grown-up destiny.20 This discovery led him to presume a teleology - a sort of force lying outside space, a non-observable force known only in its effects, namely to influence the direction of other physical forces (originally a Cartesian idea), that is, to turn the direction of other forces and in so doing constrain them to work together. The formal analogy with the mind-matter problem led Driesch to call this force a "soul", later to be replaced by his version of Aristotle's "entele- chy" or his own concept "psychoid".21 Even if Driesch himself understood his own position as a further development of Kant, calling himself a "critical idealist", Cassirer is predictably harsh on his metaphysical vitalism. While Kant, in the third Critique , outlined two different organizing points of view on reality, cause and purpose, each with their set of rules, Driesch commits the error of hypostasising these two ways of organisation into two competing sets of metaphysical forces. But entelechy is a free invention, as Cassirer says, it is both insensible and suprasensible at one and the same time, and hence it is only describable in the negative. In short, Driesch falls prey to the transcendental illusion, we could say; he assumes we have a special intuition giving us 19 See Cassirer (1950, p. 192, 1995a, p. 222). 20 Driesch interestingly began his career as an anti-vitalist, but his experimental findings during the 1890s made him change his position. Especially one experiment is associated with Driesch's turn to vitalism: his separation of a two-cell sea urchin embryo into its two cell components which turned out to each give rise to a grown-up sea urchin, as against earlier assumptions by Wilhelm Roux that such cells would develop into two halves of a mature organism (see Driesch 1905, 185ff). To Driesch, this proved the impossibility of a purely mechanical explanation of such biological phenomena and led him to assume a sort of organizational force towards acting outside space-time to govern biological ontogenesis. 21 Cassirer (1950, pp. 198-199, 1995a, pp. 230-231). Springer</page><page sequence="10">178 Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 direct access to suprasensible entities, and such a quasi-theological ability is of course completely ruled out in Cassirer's cool neo-Kantianism. Looking for an alternative, Cassirer turns attention to the biology of Uexküll, per- fectly realizing that Uexküll is another vitalist, counting Driesch and himself as two of a kind. Accordingly, Cassirer's interpretational work consists in an analysis of the theoretical foundation of biology of Uexküll and turning it against Uexküll's own self-conception. This manoeuvre is made possible by the fact that Uexküll's vitalism differs from Driesch's at a very decisive point. While Driesch is a physiologist and hence has a preference for dynamics, Uexküll is an anatomist with a preference for statics, in the tradition of the idealist morphologists from Cuvier on. This is why the former claims the autonomy of Wirken , the latter of Form. Cassirer takes care to quote how Uexküll argues that biological form has a status parallel to that of geometry , i.e. irreducibly spatial relations which may never be reduced to their material basis.22 Geometrical form is thus a construct wrongly rejected by Darwinism and materialism, for any true biological description must necessarily resort not only to force and matter, but also to form. Thus, it is only form, and the related concept of "typical develop- ment," which allow biology to perform deductions. Thus, Uexküll's research program is seen as one of Strukturforschung , and its implicit dismissal of a Drieschian notion of entelechy opens the gates for a completely new knowledge interest in Uexküll: that of form as an autonomous problem. Purpose is here taken, not as a separate force, but as Zweckmässigkeit , purposivity, lying in the very structural composition of biological entities, in their Planmässigkeit , their plan-like structure. In this account, every living being has its point of gravity within itself: He [Uexküll] could dismiss the causal problem of physics and chemistry if only it were recognized that causality is not the whole of science and that there is an independent problem of form, for which biology has to develop its own concepts and methods of thought. Once this was granted, the conflict between mechanism and vitalism was over so far as Uexküll was concerned. He was interested in the fact that there is a nonmaterial ordering , a rule of the living process that gives to organic matter whatever arrangement it may have.23 Cassirer obviously selects a friendly reconstruction or even modification of Uexküll's special brand of vitalism as his brother-in-arms in this struggle. Uexküll's emphasis on anatomical structure, on form, and on function, and his parallelism be- tween physical forces and organization in physics and biology, respectively, are ap- plauded as sane methodological constructions delimiting the objectivity of biology as a field. Contrastively, Driesch's parallel notions of entelechy, force, ontogenesis, and his contrasting of physics and supposed non-spatial forces are taken to be metaphys- ical constructs to be discarded. One cannot help but think that this is eine rettende Kritik , a saving criticism, of Uexküll which Cassirer sets out to perform here. True to the doctrine of Kant's outline of a theoretical biology in Kritik der Urteilskraft , there cannot be posited any real teleology in nature, neither in art nor in biology; we only 22 Cassirer (1950, p. 200, 1995a, p. 232). 23 Cassirer (1950, p. 202, 1995a, p. 235). &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="11">Synthese (2011) 179:169-186 179 have Zweckmässigkeit ohne Zweck (purposiveness without purpose). The pervasive teleology assumed in primitive vitalism must be replaced by the notion of organized wholes with interrelated parts, by the integration of functions into a system. While Driesch thus posits the autonomy of a global , biological force, analogous to psycholog- ical intentions on a larger level, we could say, Uexküll is taken to stress the autonomy of biological form on a local level only, "a nonmaterial ordering ", localized only in the specific, circular animal- Umwelt-sy stem. Thus, Cassirer appreciates the construction, on this basis, of a whole series of concepts specific to biology: the distinction between inner and outer causes, " Anlage " (disposition), "organism", "system", "function", "typical development" etc., which may not merely be defined causally/mechanically. Related ideas, of course, are already to be found in Driesch, but there such biolog- ical concepts are uncritically taken for global concepts and thus made to work as real entities in the ontological framework of Driesch's biology. Uexküll, in Cassirer's account, subjects biological concepts to a critique avoiding any such metaphysical pit- falls. As many differences between Uexküll and Cassirer as there remain, the common Kantian grounding of their theoretical work, seems to be what allows for Cassirer to construe a sort of cleansed, sanitized Uexküll in his epistemology of biology. Cas- sirer's recovery of Uexküll as an epistemologist of biology is constructed after the orthodox pattern of Kant's third Critique , where the concept series of physics/ con- stitutive rules/mechanics/mathematics/deduction are opposed to biology/ regulative rules/ teleology/ description/ induction. The introduction of Uexküll's epistemology of biology, being the last step before Cassirer's conclusion, has a central function in Cassirer's overall argument: it is what allows him to generalize the Uexküllian form concept to the concept of wholeness (" Ganzheit "), covering also field physics and Gestalt psychology. This allows Cas- sirer further to specify this concept of wholeness in biology: To employ a teleological method in the study of living organisms means only that we examine the process of life so as to discover to what extent the character of wholeness manifests itself. [...] The expression 'wholeness' has the advantage of being completely free from hypothesis. It contains nothing psychic, nor does it assert that the events of life must always proceed in such a way as to achieve the highest degree of purposiveness.24 Thus, according to Cassirer, the introduction of wholeness, of Aristotelian potential- ity, of animal- Umwelt-sy stems as quasi Leibnizian monads is unproblematic - these suspiciously metaphysical imports in the concept networks of biology are deemed innocent - as long as the incorporations take place within the theoretical confines of form and function. Similarly, Driesch's metaphysical concepts of "constellation harmonies, causal harmonies, and functional harmonies" in biology should be reinter- preted as categories of form, not of cause. 25 In this account, form generally functions as a sort of secularization of all sorts of vital forces, also because it, contrary to all versions of "vital forces", opens the gates for empirical research: 24 Cassirer (1950, p. 213, 1995a, p. 247). 25 Cassirer (1950, p. 214, 1995a, p. 248). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="12">180 Synthese (2011) 179:169-186 In establishing this idea that life is ordered toward wholeness we are simply concerned with a phenomenon that can be demonstrated by purely empirical methods. No theoretical scepticism can prevent our recognition of this 'order- ing' as something factually given.26 Cassirer's sophisticated correction to Darwinism, thus, amounts to the fact that biol- ogy, without the conceptual work of 'forms', 'wholes', and a whole series of related concepts, is simply impossible. This gives Cassirer the occasion to turn the tables in an interesting way. Cassirer argues that the protagonists of Darwinism commit the same error as the vitalists whenever they ferociously try to force every organ or every single feature of a living being to comply with the notions of immediate utility and selection value.27 Cassirer's criticism of biological vitalism is trivial today, less so his criticism of Darwinism. Yet, this criticism appears to be validated, if we, in the Cassirerian method, look at what is today produced in biology, from biophysics and molecular biology up to ecology and ethology: nowhere are concepts of form and wholeness absent. And even if biologists tell you such notions are mere metaphors, which might easily be discarded, it is, for a Cassirerian, a revealing fact that they are not, in actual science, discarded.28 4 The problem of form in Cassirer Thus assessed in correlation, Cassirer's Uexkiill references paint a double portrait of the biology of Uexkiill. We see: 1 . Uexkiill as the biologist who provides contrast material to a philosophical anthro- pology: animals are defined as living beings that, contrary to man, are confined to closed Umwelten and have no access to " geistige Formen ". 2. Uexkiill as the biologist providing (parts of) an organicist solution to the tension between mechanicism and vitalism in the epistemology of biology, thereby show- ing biology to display the same irreducible duplicity between cause and form as do the humanities. These two doctrines can be summed up in the assertion that animals have forms - but they do not know it. Cultures, too, have forms and neither have immediate access to their own symbolic forms, by means of which they construct themselves. But cultures may learn about their inherent forms in the process of enlightenment, establishing at the same time a development and unfolding of symbolic forms and an Abbau of these same symbolic forms, a construction and a deconstruction, so to speak. 26 Cassirer (1950, p. 215, 1995a, p. 249. 27 Cassirer cites the German biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy for stating: "In fact, the idea of the whole- ness of life, conceived of purposively, has been badly used many times, first in Darwinism, which in its endeavors to discover a use and survival value for every organ and characteristic [...]" (Cassirer (1950, p. 215), 1995a, pp. 249-250). Structurally, it is exactly the same argument which has been forcefully made by current biosemioticians, e.g., Jesper Hoffmeyer and Claus Emmeche: biology never stops using semiotic vocabulary ("genetic code", "DNA information", "RNA messenger", "transcriptase", etc.), so we might as well take such expressions seriously and make a thorough investigation of the roles of signs in biology. â Springer</page><page sequence="13">Synthese (2011) 179:169-186 181 The question of how the passage from animals, caught within the closed confines of circular chains of expressions, to human beings, opening the world for themselves by means of Darstellungen , comes to pass during evolution, is simply not asked by Cassirer. The semiotic "missing link" between expressions and representation is con- sequently not posed as a problem. In the employment of Uexküll as animal biologist, Cassirer downplays the problem of higher animals and their ability at recognizing neutral objects (objects not directly relevant to any immediate biological need), a tendency which emphasizes the strong (but not the only) tendency in Uexküll not to recognize the existence of neutral objects in the Umwelten of higher animals. Cassirer, in other words, makes animals simpler than they are by bringing Uexküll in as a provider of biological contrast to his own philosophical anthropology. In the employment of Uexküll as an epistemologist of biology, on the other hand, Cassirer's appreciation of Uexküll as an organicist comes at a price. Uexküll's many vitalist features must be ignored; thus, Cassirer benignly overlooks Uexküll's ardent anti-Darwinism, even anti-evolutionism, and his romanticist idea of the complete per- fection and harmonious fit of living nature. This is related to the issue of neutral objects: if all functions in the functional circle of a living being immediately find their perfect Umwelt counterpart and are thus satisfied, then no neutral objects are perceived. By contrasting Uexküll to the Drieschean type of vitalism, Cassirer succeeds in presenting Uexküll as less a vitalist than he in fact is. Thus, Cassirer performs a saving criticism of Uexküll, on which to form the basis of his own sophisticated organicism, which realizes the high complexity of biology, as against the simpler mechanicism or the simpler vitalism. The first of these readings of Uexküll does in fact correspond to substantial parts of Uexküll's writings.29 From todays' point of view, Uexküll's schema of biology crudely simplifies reality to the extent that the cognitive and behavioral abilities of higher animals are, as a tendency, reduced to the simple set of interrelated percep- tions-reactions of a tick. The second of Cassirer's readings, on the other hand, makes the best of Uexküll's vacillation between a crude vitalism and a more sophisticated organicism. While both of these tendencies in Uexküll might peacefully coexist in a reconstruc- tion of Uexküll's theory because they, respectively, operate on the object and method levels, it is interesting that the ambiguous Uexküll portrait resulting from the com- parison between Cassirer's two Uexküll readings points back to an ambiguity in the notion of form in Cassirer's own writings: 1 . On the one hand, Cassirer claims that the distinction between form and cause constitute a basic tension in all sciences, at least in all sufficiently complicated sciences. This is especially clearly stated in Cassirer's marvelous 1945 structur- alism article, where structure/Gestalt concepts are charted within a lineage of 29 Uexküll also vacillates on this issue; in the earlier Theoretische Biologie , he is surprisingly more favorable towards neutral objects than it the late Bedeutungslehre. Why he tends to downplay the intelli- gence of higher animals in his later work is difficult to determine. We remarked that in his political musings, he tended to embrace the same sharp distinction between animal and man as did Cassirer (albeit for opposite reasons), so we cannot exclude a political motivation for this tendency in Uexküll. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="14">182 Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 form thinking, ranging from Goethe's botanic sketches over Maxwellian field theory in physics and Gestalt theory in psychology, to Jakobsonian structural lin- guistics and, of course, in the cultural sciences in general (thereby, as a matter of fact, generalizing the physics/biology distinction in Kant's third Critique to cover causal and structural aspects of all sciences). The distinction is basic also in the sciences of culture - as claimed in the Zur Logik der Kulturwissenschaften (1942). 2. On the other hand, the Form concept is of course central to Cassirer's gen- eral notion of "symbolic form" - which is a concept comprising both causes and forms as principles of understanding (in myth, art, science, language, pol- itics, technology). Symbolic forms are not necessarily explicit; rather, as a rule, they are implicit. While animals may never achieve the abilities required for explicit form shaping - they are not " Form fähig " - , humans may, in the devel- opment of cultural processes, constitute a whole range of symbolic forms allow- ing them to objectify their surroundings. Subsequently, humans even have the possibility of becoming conscious of these forms in an ongoing quasi-Hege- lian loop of self-interpretation via the ongoing interpretation of man-made sym- bolic artefacts. The aim of enlightened philosophy and science, in Cassirer's account, seems to be nothing less than to support this making explicit and hence making more controllable the plethora of symbolic forms developed throughout history. There is obviously a tension between the two concepts of form. First, form and cause are envisioned as different methodologies of (primarily scientific) understanding of the empirical given. And secondly, form is understood as the constructive device of the human mind as such, comprising both cause and form in the former sense. Maybe there need be no tension between the two. The symbolic forms in Cassirer's philosophy are precisely not passive moulds that shape experience at a remote and unreachable location deep within the human mind, such as traditional Kantianism may easily claim. Quite on the contrary, the symbolic forms are vehicles for action, they are construc- tive, causative tools. By highlighting this notion and the productive aspect of human culture, Cassirer, as a matter of fact, aims to mend that fateful fault of modern epis- temology from Descartes and Locke onwards, namely the tendency to marginalize or even completely eradicate action, with all the well-known sceptical implications. Just like in Uexklill or in Peircean pragmatism, action is always inextricably interlinked with perception in Cassirer's account. So in this sense, symbolic forms are not only forms, but causes and purposes at the same time. A related issue is the status in reality of the "intermediate" form concepts of biol- ogy, which the whole Uexküll construction was aimed at legitimizing. The Kantian balance on the blade of a knife in the third Critique may be read as denying such concepts any objectivity. That is not Cassirer's contention, even though he maintains the difference between the form concepts and physical objects. But if form, function, and signs in biology are indeed objective, for which Cassirer argues very convinc- ingly, another question is whether we should not prefer a sort of Husserlian middle way between ontology and epistemology in order to secure such concepts against nominalists? Accordingly, the issues and concepts of biology should not merely be Springer</page><page sequence="15">Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 183 comprehended as epistemological; on the contrary, they pertain to regional ontol- ogies which are nested within each other on top of physical ontology. Of course, concepts like form, sign, and function do not have the same status as concepts captur- ing physical entities. All the same, they should not be seen as merely epistemological conventions. Cassirer's reconstruction of Uexkiill on this point should be taken to pertain to materially ontological concepts belonging to the regional ontology of biol- ogy, which is, in turn, dependent upon physical ontology. Thus, there is no need to dualistically oppose the notions of cause and teleology. The latter is no more than a local concept defined by the more or less complicated function circles of the organ- ism in question, and it depends upon the concept of cause. Thus, I agree with Cas- sirer that organicism is the middle way to pursue, and that concepts like "form", "order", and "wholeness" are simply indispensable to biology - but such concepts should be interpreted realistically, corresponding to biosemiotics' actual claim that semiotic vocabulary in biology is ineradicable, or the claim by current theoretical biologists like Stuart Kauffman that evolution presupposes evolvable order, not the other way around. 5 To conclude: neutral objects and the complexity of biology Finally, Cassirer's two readings of Uexkiiirs biology indirectly address an issue which is a delicate matter both for Uexkiill as well as for Cassirer, namely the question of the existence of neutral objects in the Umwelten of higher animals. As we argued, both advocate a sharp dichotomy between animal and human capabilities, albeit for directly opposed reasons. Uexkiill, on the one hand, celebrates the perfection of ani- mal's fit into its surroundings and contrastingly attacks the extravagant ways of tech- nology and civilization. Cassirer, on the other hand, celebrates humans' capability of form-shaping and the ensuing development of culture, and contrastingly criticizes the conservative "naturalistic" political and philosophical utopias of the vitalists of his time. Both, as a consequence, hesitate to fully approach the issue of a gradual, even if evolutionarily quick, transition from animal to human. Uexkiill may ignore this for the very basic reason that he is simply no Darwinist, so, for him, any evolu- tionary explanation of the specificities of the human mind is deemed out of bounds. Cassirer, of course, endorses evolutionism, but due to the sharp Kantian dualism between ideas and the empirically given, he sees the human capacity for form as a faculty complex sui generis. This capability is opposed to the closed capabilities of animals within cause-like association chains. Thus, it does not occur to Cassirer to investigate further into the evolutionary connections of human capabilities to animal capabilities. In the Theoretische Biologie , it is true, Uexkiill admits that some animals with complex Umwelten do in fact have access to neutral objects. This idea is, however, rejected again later in the Bedeutungslehre (cf. Stjernfelt 2001), probably due to the tension between this idea and Uexkiill's perfect fit idea of the relation between animal and Umwelt. For a neutral object is, of course, defined by its being grasped by the organism in question, on the one hand, without immediately entering into any spe- cific perception-action circle, on the other. The existence of neutral objects is thus the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">184 Synthese (201 1) 179:169-186 prerequisite for the formation of stable Umwelt territory mappings (a map necessarily involving lots of features which have no direct bearing on any actual action series performed by the animal, features which have the status of merely possibly entering into future action sequences). At the same time, neutral objects form the prerequisite of any kind of learning exceeding mere association conditioning. Neutral objects give the organism in question a sort of representation involving blank slots which may be filled in by means of further experience. Thus, a whole series of capabilities only present in higher animals are intimately connected to the appearance of neu- tral objects - e.g., mappings of surroundings, attention, memory, flexible ontogenetic learning. In the cognitive ethology tradition developed since Cassirer and Uexkiill, research has shown without any possible doubt that neutral objects are common in the perception fields of higher animals (see, e.g., Beckoff et al. 2002).30 To that extent, any debate for or against neutral objects in higher animal Umwelten has long since been decided empirically. Clearly, the issue has ceased to be subject to purely philosophical discussions. This, nevertheless, does not mean that these results have been philosophically interpreted in a satisfying manner. For what does the increasing recognition of surprising degrees of cognitive capabilities in higher animals entail for philosophical anthropology? That discussion is only in the beginning phase today - a couple of promising answer attempts are Terrence Deacon's idea that the ability to process Peircean symbols is what largely distinguishes animal and human cognition, or Michael Tomasello's idea that the faculty of shared attention is a human privilege which sets us apart from even our most able primate relatives. Here, as we saw, Cas- sirer^ idea would be the introduction of language, facilitated by the appearance of the subject-object distinction as well as the predicate-subject distinction. I myself would name Peircean "hypostatic abstraction" as a good candidate, but it is to this day unclear what would be the precise criteria for a common solution to the issue. Perhaps some of the proposed solution quoted are simply equivalent. Must we not assume intersubjec- tivity as a prerequisite to pure subjects and objects? Is not shared attention required for any sophisticated language learning? Are not abstract symbols needed for language acquisition? The answer is, in any case, far more complex than the mere appearance of neutral objects, but the answer must necessarily obey Cassirer's epistemology of biology rather than the crude biology he paints in the background of his philosophical •*° In the multitude of papers displaying the state of the art of cognitive ethology, a striking amount of intelligent behaviours are charted, each highlighting aspects of what appeared as the "neutral object" issue in Uexkiill. To name just two examples: the ingenious tactics used by ground squirrels to assess their snake predators, involving judging their size and temperature while they are partially hidden; orientation by means of cognitive maps and concept formation (such as in the recognition of human letters apart from size, color, position, or font) in honey bees. So, complicated cognitive-behavioural competencies seem ably to transgress what was expected by Uexkiill (and by Cassirer), and all of them involve aspects of neutral object perception and action, because aspects or objects of the surroundings, which are not immediately involved in perception-action-circles, are necessary for their completion. Both Uexkiill and Cassirer seem to have fallen prey to what is called "anthropomorphism by omission" (Rivas and Burghardt, 2002, 1 Off), that is, the idea that the Umwelten of animals are basically rather close to ours, which easily leads to the idea that the abilities of animals in that world are far inferior to ours. Curiously, this kind of anthropomor- phism - contrary to its "normal" form - often leads to the assumption that the animals in question can do considerably less than what they can in fact do.
