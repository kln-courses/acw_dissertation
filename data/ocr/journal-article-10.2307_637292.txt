<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME PROBLEMS IN ANAXIMANDER THIS article deals with four almost classic problems in Anaximander. Of these the first is of comparatively minor importance, and the second is important not for what Anaximander thought but for what Aristotle thought he thought. Problem I is: Did Anaximander describe his 3 dE"repov as apX-, ? Problem 2: Did Aristotle mean Anaximander when he referred to people who postulated an intermediate substance? Problem 3: Did Anaximander think that there were innumerable successive worlds? Problem 4: What is the extent and implication of the extant fragment of Anaximander ? Appended is a brief con- sideration of the nature of Theophrastus' source-material for Anaximander; on one's opinion of this question the assessment of the last two problems will clearly depend. The present article was read as a paper to the Oxford Philological Society in November 1953, and has been slightly emended as a result of the helpful dis- cussion on that occasion. Recently there has appeared a study of considerable interest and importance, J. B. McDiarmid's 'Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes', Harvard Studies in Classical Philology lxi (I953), 85-156. In his brief discussion of Anaximander (pp. 96-102, with notes) McDiarmid has a good deal to say which bears on my problems I, 2, and 4. In the first two cases, and up to a sharply defined point in problem 4 (after which there is a radical differ- ence of interpretation), his views complement my own. It seemed more useful, therefore, to leave my main text unaltered (except for the addition of the present paragraph), and to refer to McDiarmid's views, where necessary, in additional footnotes-one or two of them of some length. It might be added that the suggestions at the end of this paper about Theophrastus' access to original Presocratic sources may now be judged in the light of McDiarmid's general thesis (which he seems to me to have proved'), that Theophrastus is heavily dependent on Aristotle's Presocratic interpretations, and should not be unthinkingly accepted as an independent source. In the table on the following page will be found the main evidence, set out in corresponding columns, for the reconstruction of Theophrastus' abridged account ofAnaximander's arche. Simplicius appears to give a more or less exact quotation from the two-volume abridgement of PvaltK6 V 6d0'e. Hippolytus and the pseudo-Plutarchean Stromateis give looser paraphrases. In the right-hand column I have placed some extracts from Aristotle which illustrate Theo- phrastus' dependence on him at some points. If one compares the language of AEyE 5' av'-r`v . . . .a6Yv adrEpov in column I with Aristotle's o0 68 Epl O VEws- TdVc-rES3 KTA. in column 4 (where the sense is notably different), one sees that Theophrastus was so soaked in Aristotle that he tended on occasion to express (and to distort) his meaning by means of the mere rearrangement of complex Aristotelian terms.

Jaeger claims': with this I disagree (see n. I on p. 23). (2) 'It makes no sense, since Simplicius has already treated the water of Thales as a material substratum of the oppo- sites (Phys., p. 149, 5-7 and p. 150, 11-12).' This objection seems to me to be met by my submission below that 'Anaximander would be singled out here as the first explicit holder of the idea in question because oppo- sites were actually named by him (and not of course by Thales) as emerging from the arche.' But McDiarmid would not accept this: see n. 2 on p. 26. He usefully calls attention to another passage in Simplicius, de Caelo p. 615.

I merely wish to revive and reinforce Burnet's view (E.G.P.4 54, n. 2) that, on the contrary, what is meant is that Anaximander was the first to call his material principle (for which pXy~ was the normal Peripatetic term) by the name ro rEpov. The Simplicius version seems to me to mean that and nothing else. The Hippolytus version, printed in column 2, is odd as it stands: I know of no good parallel for the genitive of the name given, after the phrase gEvotta KaAcEv. Burnet suggested that rohlro was omitted by haplography before -rogvotta, which seems probable enough in itself; compare another corruption in the Hippolytus pas- sage, T7v . . . KOdalOV for r70o . . . Kd~LovS. As for KaAEaaa, it is possible as it stands, or it may have replaced an original Kotdaas (which indeed is more likely in view of the greater accuracy elsewhere of Simplicius' version): note that Hippolytus omits 76rv KaA ov1tE'v UVTOLXElwV, which he nevertheless prob- ably read in his source. If this interpretation is correct, Theophrastus was simply developing Aristotle's judgement at Phys. / 4. 203aI6 (the first passage in the right-hand column above), that all the qvaCKol assumed an rcLpov: Anaximander was the first actually to use the expression, and as a complete description of the arche. The real objection to the Burnet interpretation, however, is based on another passage of Simplicius, in Phys. p. 150. 20 Diels: ETepos 8 7pdoro- KaO0 8v OVKE'~ 7r7v tLEwrafoArv -r-g oVA-gt't CLoL-v-ratoaSE Ka-ra a&amp;AAotiowrv 701) V7TOKELLEoVOV -aS 7EVEUELS airoS&amp;0aoutv, 'AAd Ka-r' EKKpLCUrLCV voaras yap -ag~ Evavo-r)7a5 El' T( 1flTyOKELCIEVCO V -7TOKEQIEvOV. I accept that the obvious meaning of the last clause is 'having been the first to call the substratum of opposites &amp;pq '. Yet leaving aside the possibility that Simplicius might merely have misunderstood Theophrastus, this piece of information is quite gratuitous and irrelevant in the place where it stands. Burnet's interpretation of the clause was: 'being the first to name the substratum of the opposites as the material cause'. I accept this as a possible, though not the obvious, meaning of these words.' What seems important is that such a meaning would be absolutely relevant, instead of absolutely irrelevant, to Simplicius' commentary here, the sense of which is that the vtaCKOl made their originative substance a substratum of Aristotelian change. Admittedly this is assumed to be true, also, of Thales qua qvaUCKos: but Anaximander would be singled out here as the first explicit holder of the idea in question because opposites were actually named by him (and not of course by Thales) as emerg- ing from the arche. Three final points. First, Theophrastus, like Aristotle, was content to use the word &amp;pXyq4, without special comment, in his remarks on Thales, and Simplicius had actually quoted those remarks only about 250 words before the passage on Anaximander. Secondly, if Simplicius had really understood from Theo- phrastus that Anaximander pioneered this sense of &amp;pnX, he might be expected to have introduced this information somewhat earlier, in his long expansion of Aristotle's discussion of dpXal at the very beginning of his commentary (in Phys., pp. 3-7 Diels, esp. p. 6, lines 31 ff.). Thirdly, it is admitted that Anaximander At any rate Jaeger's objection, The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers 201, n. 28, that odvo/~'L4Ev must mean literally 'to give the name of', is not cogent. This verb is sometimes used loosely to mean 'specify as', 'identify as'; e.g. Plato, Rep. 4. 428 e S. . oO e7TLaT7I aS(Z Eg XOv Ore voLaova WE eLva..</page><page sequence="4">24 G. S. KIRK could perfectly well have used aopX'4, meaning 'source', compare, for example, velKEo &amp;ppX4 in the Iliad. In any case I should have expected him, like most cosmogonists, to have used phrases like dlT' &amp;dpyx- or KaT' apXV. But JpX-' used by itself, and not in prepositional phrases, does not occur in the surviving frag- ments of any other Presocratic thinker, as a description of the primary and originative substance. I find this silentium odd, though of course by no means conclusive. In sum, I do not think that Burnet's view can be proved to be correct; but I suggest that it is at least as likely to be right as the accepted view, and should certainly not be regarded as liquidated.' 2. DID ARISTOTLE MEAN ANAXIMANDER WHEN HE REFERRED TO PEOPLE WHO POSTULATED AN INTERMEDIATE SUBSTANCE? It is well known that in nine places Aristotle, when listing the material prin- ciples of monistic physicists, mentions a substance intermediate between the so-called elements: either denser than fire and finer than air, or denser than air and finer than water, or once, oddly and no doubt by error, intermediate between water and fire. Of the ancient commentators, Alexander referred all and Simplicius most of these passages to Anaximander. Zeller, however, fol- lowed Simplicius in noting that one of them clearly places Anaximander in a quite separate group from whoever postulated an intermediate substance: Physics A 4. 187aI2 c 8' o (1 VctKo1 AE'ovcr, 8aUo Tpd~oro EtColv. od ltEv ydp Ev IroLt-7cavTEs gO oocqtqa To v7ToKEqIEVOV, 7) qTV TpLWV Tc 7) qlAAo o" E)r-r 7T irvpop v ITVKVoTEpOV aEpos- SE AEIT-roTEpov, Tad Aa yEvvclr 7TVKVdOrIfL Kal t avo-rq-L rITOAAa roTowv'Es . ... o 8' EK 0Evog .

This crucial passage states that 'the physicists may be divided into two groups. Those (ol 'v) who make the corporeal substratum one, either one of the three (sc. fire, air, water) or something else denser than fire and finer than air, generate the rest by thickening and thinning . .. while the others (ol 3E) say that the opposites are separated out from the one, in which they inhere, as Anaximander says .. .'. On the strength of this passage Zeller (Z-N I. i. 283 ff.) held that Anaximander can never be meant when an intermediate is mentioned. A few, for example Burnet (E.G.P.4 55 f.) and Joachim (Aristotle on Coming-to-be and Passing-away, 193 and 225), clung to Alexander's view, but Zeller has carried the day and it is now widely taken for granted (for example by Ross, Aristotle, Physics, 482 f.) that the intermediate substance has nothing to do with Anaximander.2 One of the characteristics of this highly academic dispute is the freedom with which each side has simply ignored hostile evidence. Thus Burnet ignored the crucial passage already quoted; while those, on the other hand, who maintain that the references must be to some unknown thinkers intermediate between Anaximenes and Heraclitus, for example (!) (cf. Ross, loc. cit.), neglect the damag- ing fact that the description of the nature of the intermediate body varies from passage to passage, apparently at random. Burnet remarked: 'This variation I With McDiarmid's support I now feel inclined to claim rather more than this. 2 McDiarmid has a good discussion (op. cit., pp. Ioo ff.) of the way in which] Aris- totle and then Theophrastus were able to treat Anaximander as both a monist and a pluralist. He does not go into the particular difficulties of the intermediate-substance terminology, but obviously assumes that Anaximander is sometimes meant.</page><page sequence="5">SOME PROBLEMS IN ANAXIMANDER 25 shows at once that he [sc. Aristotle] is not speaking historically'. If this were modified so as to mean that Aristotle did not always have in mind a specific intermediate actually postulated by a specific thinker, I should agree un- reservedly.' Once again, the commonly discarded view seems the more correct. The idea of intermediate substances surely arose in the first instance out of Aristotle's obvious bewilderment at Anaximander's concept of an originative material qualified only as adrELpov (which Aristotle took to mean, primarily, spatially infinite), and as divine and all-encompassing. Himself committed to the four simple bodies and to the theory of change as between opposites, and accepting 'the elements' as the key-note ofprimitive physics, Aristotle normally assumed that Anaximander must have meant his d7rEtpov to have some relation to one or more of the ar-oXErLa-especially since it evidently gave rise to the opposites. Thus at Phys. r 4. 203a16 (quoted in the right-hand column on p. 22), in the course of his discussion of infinity, Aristotle asserted that all the qvaLKOl, obviously including Anaximander, attach to the infinite some other substance from the so-called elements, for example water or air or something intermediate between the two. Here we may pertinently ask what substance Anaximander attached to the drrwEpov, in Aristotle's present judgement, if not an intermediate. The conviction that there should be some relationship, even if not one of simple identity, between ro d7rEtpov and the Presocratic elements underlies the use of Aristotle's phrase 3 orapad Ta rTocXEra, 'that which is other than the elements, is not identifiable with any of them'. Some at least of the passages in which this phrase occurs, although no formal mention is made of Anaximander (whom Aristotle names only four times in all), almost certainly refer to him.

The argument is that this substance is corporeal, and therefore perceptible, by definition: hence it must have the properties of perceptible bodies, lightness or weight, etc., and so be bound up with the opposites and Nevertheless, Nicolaus and Porphyrius suggested Diogenes of Apollonia, whose arche was indubitably air and not an intermediate; while Zeller and Diels hit infelicitously upon one Idaeus of Himera, about whom we are told one thing and no more by antiquity, that he, too, believed the arche to be air.</page><page sequence="6">26 G. S. KIRK positively related to the elements. The description 7d aTElpov 70roro, r A6yovUa -rT&amp;Ve dEvac 'Tv adpxyqv must, I think, be intended to refer to Anaximander. (iii) Phys. / 5. 204b22 declares that some people say that there is an infinite body beside the elements, -d rrapa 1- a 'roCXEa, to avoid the consequence that deriva- tive bodies would be destroyed by the infinite stuff if both it and they were characterized by opposites. This reason for the avoidance of an actual consti- tuent of our differentiated world as originative substance, although expressed in typically Aristotelian terms, may well have been substantially Anaxi- mander's,' contra Cherniss, Aristotle's Criticism of Presocratic Philosophy, 376. It accords with the implication of the extant fragment, to be discussed later, which cannot be said of the other motive suggested by Aristotle for the hypo- thesis of an infinite arche-'that becoming might not fail', "va 4- ydV'EcLs !t Ed7Lda7Tl . Admittedly a motive resembling this latter one was assigned to Anaximander by Aatius and presumably, therefore, by Theophrastus: but Theophrastus may simply have picked the wrong one of the two motives sug- gested by his master, or he may have thought that both were relevant. In view of the above instances we may accept the opinion of many scholars that in some at any rate of the passages concerning a substance other than the elements Aristotle appears to have Anaximander in mind. If this is so, then we may take it that on occasions at least Aristotle thought of Anaximander's -r adr7pov as r 7rapa 7- rotxd a. Now the formulation -r 7rapd --dr uarotxEa is presumably a deliberate one. One notices that it is wide enough to embrace not only intermediate substances, if such were really to exist, but also other postulable forms of matter not iden- tical with fire or air or water or earth. Normally, it is true, the phrase appears to refer to an intermediate. It may be significant, however, that in one passage, Phys. b 5. 204b29 (continuing the passage cited at (iii) above), the idea ex- pressed by the phrase in question is refuted by an argument appreciably wider than (though not precluding) that regularly brought to bear against any inter- mediate substance: not that it is an element, merely, with excess or deficiency of one contrary (as, for example, at de Generatione B I. 332a22, quoted under (i) above), but that if it were originally perceptible body we should still be able to perceive it, since things are destroyed into that from which they came. Theoretically, then, a mixture or fusion of the so-called elements, in addition to an intermediate between them, might come under the broad heading of r6 rapa rad urotXEa. Now that Aristotle was inclined on occasion to class Anaxi- mander with Empedocles and Anaxagoras, as separating out the opposites from an original One, we know both from Phys. A 4. 187a20 (quoted on p. 24) and from Met. A 2. Io69b2I : 76 tvaeaydpov Ev ... KaL 'E ? " ESOKAoVVg 7- p8yla KLat AvaetfdvApov. It is not difficult to guess why Aristotle considers Anaximander in this light: it is because he knew that Anaximander used a term like &amp;7ro- KpLVEacaL or EKKpLtL, or because he knew that Anaximander somehow produced opposed substances in a secondary stage of the world-forming process.2 In So also McDiarmid, Harvard Studies lxi (1953), 99. 2 U. H61scher, Hermes lxxxi (1953), 261 f. (cf. 265-7), thinks that it was Aristotle who supplied the opposites in Anaximander, be- cause he took Anaximander's use of dJo- KpLVEoatL (which need not imply opposites) to imply the KKPtatS of Aristotle's own oppo- sites and the four simple bodies. One should certainly be cautious here, but I think that H1lscher's attempt to deny the concept of opposites to Anaximander has no indisput- able foundation, and that it is contrary to the probable implications of the fragment and to Heraclitus' implicit correction of Anaxi- mander. McDiarmid now adds his warning</page><page sequence="7">SOME PROBLEMS IN ANAXIMANDER 27 either case, Aristotle would have assumed, o draELpov must, for Anaximander, have potentially or actually contained the opposites. According to the present suggestion, then, Aristotle, by thinking of Anaximander as postulating a first principle which was not identifiable with any of the traditional elements, which was 7rapa a r-roxEEa, was enabled by the ambiguity of this formulation and the concept which it expresses to concentrate on either of two alternative interpre- tations of -o' dELpov-as an intermediate, or as a mixture. Passages have been adduced in which each interpretation is used; though it must be admitted that the two mixture-interpretation passages do not use the 7rapa " 7aoxTLtEca formu- lation. Thus it may be that in the crucial passage Phys. A 4. I87aI2 (on p. 24), where Aristotle divides the vtULKol into two classes, those who generate out of the one by condensation and rarefaction, and those who generate by separation from a mixture, Anaximander appears explicitly in the second class; but Aristotle is led to associate with the first class, also, a type of substance, for the sake of exhaustivity, which he elsewhere normally connects with Anaximander. That an intermediate substance should be named on occasion simply for the sake of exhaustivity, and be devoid for the time being of any specific historical association for Aristotle, may seem improbable on first consideration. Yet the casual way in which the intermediate may be introduced is exemplified by Met. A 8. 989aI 2: KaTa t LV O'1V 70170OV 7oyV Aoyov OT" El 7LS r707Wro 7L AEyEL 7rA-jv 7rVpdS, OT7' E 7LS r EpOS Epo 7TKVd'EpOV O7O70 T UL' V TSaOros 3E AE7T7d7EpOV, OZK pO6hios &amp;v AEoYL. Here Aristotle's argument is that he who explains yC"YEls by accretion should postulate as arche the finest form of matter, that is, fire; 'otherwise, if he specifies anything but fire, even if he made it denser than air and finer than water, he would be at fault'. Clearly the second-best to fire here is the intermediate between fire and air, and Aristotle should have said 'denser than fire and finer than air'.' He also varies in his treatment of intermediates as a class. At Phys. A 6. I89b5 he asserts that 7- pE7are' is less bound up with the opposites than the elements are, but elsewhere there is held to be no dis- tinction between them in this respect. At de Generatione B 5. 332a20 (quoted on (op. cit., pp. 1oi f.) to H61scher's, and in particular calls attention to Simplicius in Phys. p. 27. 11 Diels (Dox. 479. 2), where Simplicius may assert that, according to Theophrastus, Anaximander separated gold and earth out of his arrepov. The question is whether EKELVOS here refers to Anaximander or to Anaxagoras (the two are being com- pared). Both views have been taken, and I am not convinced that McDiarmid is right in saying that EKELVOS must be Anaximander. We have to take into account that the choice of the strong demonstrative may have been determined by the lost context in Theo- phrastus himself, or even in Alexander, and not by the extant context in Simplicius' ver- sion. In this extant context, it is true, EKEVoS9 should refer to Anaximander: and this is important evidence so far as it goes. In any event, I do not maintain that what is separ- ated off from Anaximander's dtrTLpov must only be the two important pairs of opposites mentioned by Heraclitus, canonized by Em- pedocles, and taken over by Aristotle- though these were the most obvious cosmo- logical (and meteorological) oppositions at any date. Nor would I insist that only objects defined by their names as opposites (e.g. -r8 OEptzdv and -r 8bvxpdov, or 7 UaKA7pdv and b C paAaKodv) are separated off. We can see from Anaxagoras fr. 4 that no one kind of classification would necessarily be used. If Anaximander (and not only Anaxagoras) mentioned gold and earth among the things separated from the Indefinite, this does not mean that he did not feel all those things to possess contrary 8vvd/IELs in one way or another; though some would have a more obvious polarity (and would perhaps be more important cosmologically) than others. See also p. 33 below. SA slip by Aristotle, or a displacement in the text-tradition, is a possibility, of course, but hardly more probable than not. We have allowed him one such slip already- the intermediate between water and fire (omitting air) at Phys. A 6. 189bI.</page><page sequence="8">28 G. S. KIRK p. 25 above), and in other passages, it is plain enough that it is the intermediate as such and not any particular intermediate that is under consideration. These factors lead to the conclusion that Aristotle did not on any occasion have any objective historical use of an intermediate substance in mind, and that he usually specified one or other intermediate almost at random, merely for the sake of example.' At the same time the variation in his treatment and the fact that the intermediate is mentioned not once but several times, when the archai of the Presocratics are in question, indicate that he thought the possibility of the existence of such substances to deserve attention, if only by refutation. The conception of the intermediate is really his own, but it arose out of a feeling that Anaximander must have meant his dTE~pov to be somehow qualified in terms of opposites. Aristotle assumed (to recapitulate) that Anaximander must have met this problem in one of the two ways which Aristotle himself suggested, both of which are covered by the description of the dITELpov as 'not identical with any of the elements'. When it was Aristotle's purpose to enumerate the single archai of the monists he tended to include -r- oE-rat, which arose out of his consideration of Anaximander and which he sometimes but not always associated with him. When, on the other hand, he turned to consider cosmo- gonies which made explicit use of the opposites, he was able to treat Anaxi- mander's dT~Lpov as being 7rap&amp; -d aUTOLXELc to the extent of containing the opposites, like Empedocles' oabapos and Anaxagoras' 7'v doioY rc7v-ra. On one occasion this latter interpretation of Anaximander is formally opposed to the postulation of an intermediate. This should persuade us not that the inter- mediate never had any association with Anaximander, but that it is simply a rather vague formulation by Aristotle which, though in the first place applied to Anaximander, is often repeated with no thought of him in mind and merely to satisfy Aristotle's own requirements of exhaustivity.2 3. INNUMERABLE WORLDS Cornford demonstrated in C.Q. xxviii (I934), I ff. that Burnet's assignment (E.G.P.4 58 ff.) of coexistent innumerable worlds to Anaximander rested on a I The intermediate between water and earth is not mentioned, since it would be liable to the same obvious objections as earth, though to a lesser degree. 2 Before leaving this problem mention should be made of an hypothesis propounded by O. Gigon in his Der Ursprung der griech- ischen Philosophie, pp. 68 ff. In our nine Aristotelian passages which refer to an inter- mediate he distinguishes between those that describe it as denser than one element and finer than another, and those (four in num- ber) which simply call it aEcratv' and do not mention density. These latter passages, Gigon asserts, are accurate references by Aristotle to Anaximander; while the others are classed as 'a later interpretation' on the dubious ground that the idea of rarefaction and condensation does not antedate Anaxi- menes. On this criterion the crucial passage Phys. A 4. 187aI2 is 'a later interpretation'. But this does not explain the opposition in that passage between Anaximander and the intermediate; for the so-called later inter- pretation, of a substance intermediate in density, was at any rate an interpretation of Anaximander, and must have been to some extent associated by Aristotle with him. The suggestion that, in those passages where as it happens (as I would contend) Aristotle does not mention density in connexion with the intermediate, we are face to face with a genuine undistorted account ofAnaximander is surely rather extravagant. This suggestion is made in order to support a theory that many will find implausible, that Anaxi- mander's T7retpov was intermediate between light and night, in a manner not so much physical as metaphysical or ideal! As so often an apparently promising initial examination of the evidence is followed by highly specu- ative conclusions which lie far beyond the range of that evidence.</page><page sequence="9">SOME PROBLEMS IN ANAXIMANDER 29 false assessment of the doxographical evidence on this point, as well as on the misinterpretation of several later Presocratics. References in the doxographers to coexistent kosmoi were due, Cornford thought, partly to a confusion with Anaximander's Kv'KAot of sun, moon, and stars, partly to a post-Theophrastean application of Atomistic arguments to all who postulated unlimited matter. Cornford accepted Zeller's contention (Z-N I. i. 305 ff.) that the plural worlds which all scholars accept in Anaximander were successive and not coexistent. His chief objection to coexistent worlds was that there is 'nothing in the appearance of nature' to suggest them (except perhaps the stars, obviously excluded by the character of Anaximander's account of them). But the same objection, I submit, applies to the successive separate worlds accepted by Zeller and Cornford-'separate', that is, as opposed to local Kdco'rL or periodical rearrangements of our earth's surface. The total destruction of the world and its reabsorption into the originative material, followed by the birth of a new world, and so on, were for long accepted in Heraclitus on the strength of the Stoic ecpyrosis-interpretation (see my Heraclitus, the Cosmic Fragments, 335 ff.), and its acceptance has perhaps unconsciously conditioned many modern scholars to countenance successive separate worlds in Anaximander. But the idea of different worlds in time would be, surely, an absolutely extra- ordinary one for an early Ionian thinker, whose object, judging from the other evidence, was to explain our world and account for its coherence. This necessi- tated, as it seemed to the Milesians, the description of a cosmic evolution from a single kind of matter. It did not necessitate the irrelevant and bizarre hypo- thesis of the world disappearing again into that same kind of matter. The material of the world was divine; it possessed its own life and movement, perhaps, but the life was the unending life of the immortal gods and not the terminable life of R. G. Collingwood's cosmic cow (The Idea of Nature, 32).' As for the argument that what was born must die, one has only to think of the widely scattered myths of the birth of Zeus, for example, to dispose of that. This world is assumed to have had a birth because only so, it seemed, could its intuited unity be rationally explained. At the same time there was undoubtedly a widespread tendency among the Greeks to believe that our world has undergone in the past, and will undergo again in the future, periods or cycles of drastic physical alteration. I refer not to the analogous idea of culture-periods like Hesiod's five ages, but to the belief in catastrophes by extensive fire and flood, a belief well illustrated in the course of the ~YOo~o at Timaeus 22 c-e: 'Many are the destructions of men and of many kinds that have been and shall be, the greatest of them by fire and water, the rest shorter and from countless other causes.' The Egyptian priest who speaks these words goes on to say that the story of Phaethon conceals a truth, that periodically the earth is scorched when the heavenly bodies incline too near in their orbits. The Deucalion myth, too, may be placed in a comparable context. These mythical traditions arose in part, no doubt, from a residual folk-memory of floods and droughts in, for example, Egypt and Mesopotamia. But in the sixth century B.C. supporting evidence of a more tangible kind was at hand. In Ionia there seemed to be incontrovertible signs that the sea was slowly drying up: the great river-mouths were silting at surprising speed, and the harbours I Collingwood's interpretation here is in- fluenced by his tendency to view archaic Greek speculation through the medium of later thought. In this case he is projecting the ideas of the Timaeus on to the Ionians (cf. op. cit. 72).</page><page sequence="10">30 G. S. KIRK of Ephesus and Miletus were in danger. Further, Xenophanes, who was not much junior to Anaximander, had access to reports of fossils from many parts of the Aegean world, from which he concluded that the land must once have been sea and is gradually drying out. In time, he thought, the process would be reversed and everything would turn into mud, and so on. Anaximander, too, might have heard of these marine fossils, which would naturally be a source of general curiosity. At all events Alexander of Aphrodisias, in his commentary on Aristotle's Meteorologica, asserted that according to Theophrastus a reference there (Meteor. B I. 353b6) to 'those who think that the sea is diminishing and drying up, and that eventually it will all be dry' was to Anaximander and Diogenes of Apollonia.' It is possible, therefore, that Anaximander did, like Xenophanes, postulate long-term changes in the constitution of the earth's surface-changes in heat and cold, dryness and wetness, which might alternate like summer and winter though at much longer intervals.2 If Anaximander held this kind of view-and we have Alexander's word for it, and no more, that Theophrastus thought he did-then it is easy to see how his theory of successive states of the earth's surface, perhaps involving the near- destruction of animal life, could have been later expanded into one of successive separate worlds. This type of distortion might be particularly easy because of the ambiguity of the word Kdo'xOS, which could signify either the world as a whole or more localized arrangements within it. Our direct evidence for successive separate worlds in Anaximander is en- tirely based upon Aristotle and Theophrastus. According to Simplicius' ver- sion of Theophrastus (in the left-hand column of the table on p. 22) he wrote of 'all the heavens and the worlds in them'; these, we are told, came from the Boundless. It is clear that this contention is meant to be supported by the frag- ment of Anaximander, which Theophrastus evidently went on to quote. I shall argue below that this fragment cannot in fact be concerned with the relation between successive worlds and the Boundless. If that is so, then the reliability of Theophrastus' testimony3 on the question of innumerable worlds falls very much under suspicion. In fact, the phrase 0ovs ovpavovi Ka~ T70o Ev av-rot Kd~UUovs looks like a reminiscence of a remark by Aristotle at de Caelo I 5. 303bIo: !voL tV p VE plEdvoV o7TO7lOEV7aa Kat 7o0'70o oL t V 3oWop, OL o' JEpa, o0 1 rvp, oS ' Vi3a-ros pt'v AErodEpovaiESpo-" 7rvKv'TEpov, 8 ~TEPLxELV baxT 7rdwrag r70o o0jpavos ELTEpov ov. Here the reference to 'all the heavens' is puzzling on any interpretation.4 Conceivably it is intended to cover those vaTLKov who might in Aristotle's view have posited plural worlds-possibly Heraclitus, and also Empedocles and the Atomists, although formally the reference is limited to monists. If, as some think, Aristotle's phrase points particularly to Anaxi- mander (for the intermediate substance has just been mentioned), we have to consider whether drdv-as o70 o0vpavovs might be intended to describe Anaxi- I Of course, Theophrastus might simply have referred this opinion to Anaximander because he thought that he at any rate postu- lated successive worlds; but on such grounds he might have referred it also to, for example, Empedocles. It would fit in, too, with Anaxi- mander's known anthropogonical theories, to which the suggestion of Alexander is not opposed. 2 Aristotle called such periods 'great sum- mer' and 'great winter' (Meteor. A 14. 352a30), though he himself argued that changes in climate and in the conformation of land and sea were localized, and were balanced by reverse changes elsewhere. 3 Or the coherence of Simplicius' account of Theophrastus, I might now add in view of McDiarmid's interpretation discussed in n. I on p. 34. 4 Less so, if one stomachs coexistent worlds in c. 6.</page><page sequence="11">SOME PROBLEMS IN ANAXIMANDER 31 mander's plural rings of the heavenly bodies: this at least is what Cornford thought. I must confess I find this difficult, and I do not think that Corn- ford adequately demonstrated that ot3pavos might be used in precisely such a sense (C.Q. xxviii (1934), IO-12). At any rate Theophrastus seems to have decided to clarify Aristotle's phrase by adding the words 'and the worlds in them'. Cornford held that he meant successive worlds, but this was certainly not implied by the Aristotle text, where 7rpEPXXEW if anything (though not by any means inevitably) suggests coexistent worlds. A further possibility is that Aris- totle was thinking of his own development of the Callippean system of concen- tric spheres (which might properly be termed oipavoi), and by a slip applied the language proper to these to the early monists.

Further, in Aristotle's enumeration of the causes of the concept of infinity comes the following passage: Phys.

The actual reference is to the Atomists, but the same argument might seem to apply to Anaximander with his dTELpov primary substance. Cornford thought that only Simplicius drew this false conclusion; but can we be sure that Theophrastus himself was not swayed by Aristotle's formulation, or the familiar Atomist arguments which determined it? In this case Simplicius' judgement would not be independent, but would depend, as often, upon the doxographical tradition stemming from Theophrastus.z Certainly the division in the two versions of Aetius (see Cornford, C.Q.. xxviii (1934), 4 f.) about the nature of Anaximander's worlds could be easily accounted for on the hypo- thesis that Theophrastus, himself lacking special information (except, he thought, for the fragment, which he misinterpreted), assigned Leucippean worlds passing away and coming to be throughout space to Anaximander. It is infuriating of Cicero not to have made himself clearer at de nat. deorum I.Io. 25: 'Anaximandri autem opinio est nativos esse deos longis intervallis orientis occidentisque, eosque innumerabilis esse mundos. sed nos deum nisi sempi- ternum intellegere qui possumus?' In this comparatively early offshoot of the Theophrastean tradition the point at issue is concealed in the ambiguous words I I owe this suggestion to Professor R. Hackforth. 2 It is important that St. Augustine, whose source for Theophrastus is separate from Simplicius', attributed Atomistic-type worlds to Anaximander: C.D. 8. 2 (DK 12 A 17).</page><page sequence="12">32 G. S. KIRK longis intervallis. Are these intervals spatial or temporal ? If spatial, they show that the assignment of Atomistic-type worlds to Anaximander probably derives from Theophrastus himself. Unfortunately there is no way of settling the ques- tion on the basis, at least, of Cicero's language.' My suggestions on the question of innumerable worlds in Anaximander may be summarized as follows. (I) The concept of successive separate worlds is a very difficult one, and is unlikely to have occurred before Parmenides forced scientific dogmatism to become more extreme, and to exceed by far the range of common sense, in the effort to overcome his criticisms. Empedocles, with his theory of successive states of the cosmic acratpos, may have mediated the idea of entirely separate successive worlds. (2) Cycles of alteration of the earth's surface, however, were accepted in ancient legend and were further suggested by the changing relation of land and sea. In one source it is implied that, according to Theophrastus, Anaximander believed in such cycles. (3) We do not know for certain what Aristotle thought; but Theophrastus may have been persuaded (a) by an illegitimate extension of the application of natural cycles in Anaximander, (b) by a misinterpretation of the extant fragment, and (c) by an application of Atomistic arguments to all who explicitly postulated (as it seemed) infinite matter, to credit Anaximander with innumerable worlds of the Atomistic type. This would account for peculiarities in the later tradition. 4.

Here is an example of special pleading almost as notable as any- thing Burnet ever perpetrated: for the con- trast implied in 'deum . . . sempiternum' is adequately provided by nativos and orientis occidentisque. 2 Similarly McDiarmid, Harvard Studies, lxi (1953), 97-98.</page><page sequence="13">SOME PROBLEMS IN ANAXIMANDER 33 clitus fr. 8o, to give Ka7t 'PLV Kat XpEcv, and XpEdv is used by itself, meaning 'necessity', in Euripides and Plato. It is a rather poetic word except in the common phrase XpEdW v Ea7, and it is this special usage alone which is found in Aristotle, six times. We should readily accept XpEcv dE'7- in Theophrastus, but not Kac7 70 XPEdV. What may have happened, therefore, is that Theophrastus paraphrased the preceding sentence in Anaximander, by substituting for it a familiar Peripatetic formulation which seemed equivalent; yet he retained the original closing phrase Ka'7 rO XpE~v to connect his paraphrase with the direct quotation which follows, &amp;Udva yap ac-r 81Ki'v KT., which contained a nar- rower restatement, and a justification, of the preceding assertion.I Now it has been argued by Heidel, Cherniss, and Vlastos that acv-r and &amp;AAAqAots must refer to more or less equal partners, because of the nature of the legal situation depicted: as Heidel put it (C.P. vii (1912), 234), 'dike obtains between peers'. This is, of course, an over-simplification. Dike as a personi- fication regulates the behaviour of man to man, but also, on occasion, of man to gods. Yet mutual 81Kqi, that is, an established reciprocal relation, was assumed to operate only between members of a single social group: there was no point, for example, in a man exemplifying his concept of dike by offering not to attack a lion. It is absurd to think, therefore, as used to be thought, that it is the world on the one hand and the Boundless on the other that stand in this relation (which is specified as a reciprocal one) to each other. How could the divine LTrEpov be said to commit injustice? Rather the subject of ac-rd is the opposed world-masses of (primarily) the predominantly hot stuffs and the predominantly cold stuffs, the wet and the dry, the first pair of which Theophrastus, according to the pseudo-Plutarchean Stromateis quoted on p. 38, said were somehow pro- ducedz from the Boundless at the beginning of the world. That this analysis into opposed substances, or into groups of objects possessing contrary 8vvd&amp;LEg, was applied not only to a stage in cosmogony but also to the continual natural processes of the developed world is not unlikely in itself.3 Whether Anaxi- mander actually called these opposed conglomerates 'the hot' and 'the cold' and so on, or whether he was content normally to use more specific terms like winter and summer (which are, however, opposed to each other and mutually exclusive), is immaterial. According to this interpretation, then, our fragment means that cosmological events are maintained by a fluctuating balance of power between opposed masses. The legalistic metaphor of excess and depriva- tion, Kdpos and XPuatpoo-avV (these words occur as fr. 65 of Heraclitus), accounts not only for the balance of natural cycles like day-night, winter-summer, heat- See Theophrastus' de sensibus for his tendency to quote isolated words and short phrases. 2 I deliberately do not emphasize any pos- sible biological meaning in yo'vpqov. It may have such a meaning here, it may imply that Anaximander used here, like the Theogony, the metaphor of sexual generation. Yet there are at least two instances in Plutarch where yodvqos means simply 'productive of', in a purely metaphorical and weakened sense and without any noticeable implication of sexual generation: Qu. conviv. 7. 715 f; Maxime cum princ. 3. 978 c. We simply cannot be sure, therefore, of its exact connotation in the pseudo-Plutarch passage. 3 The analysis into 'opposites', in the de- veloped world, was certainly made shortly after Anaximander, most notably by Hera- clitus; we are told that Anaximander used opposites at some stage in cosmogony (though see n. 2 on p. 26); it is reasonable to assume, therefore, quite apart from the evidence of the fragment, that he did not simply ignore their future history but re- tained them as constituents of our developed world of experience. It is from this world, after all, that the analysis into opposites must originally have been derived. 4599.5.1 D</page><page sequence="14">34 G. S. KIRK cold, perhaps great winter-great summer, it also explains the continuity of these cycles by providing a metaphorical, anthropomorphic motive for action and reaction. The essentials of the interpretation outlined above were stated both by Burnet and by Heidel, who failed, however, to establish any satisfactory relation be- tween this continuing cosmological balance and the odd hypothesis of innumer- able coexistent worlds. If the worlds are successive, however, the difficulties become intolerable. How does the world pass away, if it forms a self-per- petuating system? And how are we to reconcile the fragment, as Theophrastus tries to do, with the idea of innumerable worlds ? Vlastos (C.P. xlii (I947), 172) followed Cherniss in developing an ingenious but laborious answer to this problem: 'the damages are paid (sc. by the opposites) not to the Boundless but to each other', but they are only paid in full when the world is reabsorbed into the Boundless. The Boundless itself is a fusion of opposites, as is shown by the plural form of if 5v }E7' ydEwLs (Vlastos 170, after Cherniss, Aristotle's Criticism of Presocratic Philosophy, 377 ff.).' It is clear that the whole argument here depends upon the assumption that the Boundless itself somehow contains the opposites. That this is incidentally implied is undeniable; but that it should have been explicitly argued by Anaximander is contrary to the whole concep- tion of -ro i 7TELpov, which is presumably so called just because its nature cannot ' McDiarmid, op. cit., p. 97, agrees that the payment cannot be between the world and the rrTELpov; and also shows that the Cherniss-Vlastos suggestion is untenable. But he goes on to argue that the subject of 336dvac y"p ai~c is not pairs of opposed sub- stances, but is ra" vvra, the existing things of the separated world-as is shown by rot0s ovaU in the preceding sentence in Simplicius (n. 48 on p. 140). I would reply that these very existing things are in fact opposites, in the sense suggested in n. on p. 27; but that it is illegitimate to use sentence-sequence here in order to determine the precise refer- ence of aiard, since on any interpretation, and particularly on McDiarmid's, there is con- fusion in the sequence of Theophrastean generalization and direct quotation. Indeed, McDiarmid himself states on p. 98 that 'The generation-destruction clause is not to be connected with the metaphor'. His own inter- pretation of the whole passage is ingenious. He argues that in 8tovac . .. a. dLKlas Theo- phrastus 'is quoting what appears to be Anaximander's justification of his own doc- trine against Thales and anyone else who made one of the opposed elements the pri- mordial matter'. The world-constituents, I take this to mean, pay the penalty to each other, i.e. each to all the others, and not all to one constituent material, the 'pxI in the Thales-type theory. The gist of the Theo- phrastean extract according to McDiarmid is, then, as follows (p. 98): 'Anaximander declared the Infinite to be the principle of all things (i.e., that out of which all things are generated and into which they are de- stroyed) ; and he said that the Infinite is some body which is not water or any other of the so-called elements, for, as he said, "they make reparation and satisfaction to each other for their injustice".' This interpretation deserves a fuller examination than can be given it here, and is in many ways an attrac- tive one which cannot be lightly dismissed. I will only say that its plausibility is severely diminished by the necessity of assuming that, in McDiarmid's words, 'The thread of the argument has been obscured, probably by Simplicius'. If the meaning were as proposed, we should expect E'e V y ydp (not E'), and 3t3dvaS 3' dKEiVa (or another strong demon- strative), not 3o'3vac yap arad. In addition, the sentence-order would be different. But why should Simplicius or any intermediary have ruined the emphasis by tampering with pro- nouns and connecting particles-a far pro- founder change than the mechanical shift of a sentence or two ? Further, the addition of KaWT 7 rv 7-0 XpdPOU 7ctLV, whether by Theo- phrastus or by Anaximander himself, re- moves the heavy emphasis on dAA'Aotg (which is not, in any case, in a particularly emphatic position), which is demanded if the argument is to be that which McDiarmid suggests. In any case, it seems difficult to exclude from the injustice-metaphor the im- plication that the things of the world are opposed to each other.</page><page sequence="15">SOME PROBLEMS IN ANAXIMANDER 35 be properly defined. The minor argument from E'd Cv is too improbable to merit discussion.' I fall back, therefore, on the view that the fragment has nothing to do with worlds perishing into the Boundless, but that it describes cosmological changes in the one continuing world. The assertion that originally preceded Kara TO XPEdV, and which Theophrastus was able to paraphrase by an Aristotelian formula which suited his own cosmogonical interpretation of the fragment, might have been to the effect that each opposite changes into its own opposite and into no other, for example the hot is replaced by the cold and not by the wet or the soft. This is a necessary hypothesis for Anaximander's theory of cosmic stability, obvious to us but not so obvious then, since Heraclitus also emphasized it for his own special purposes. The axiom may easily have been stated in terms so general that Theophrastus was able to mistake its proper application. The final words, Ka'ra 7-rv 70o Xpovov T wcv, are treated by Theophrastus as belonging to Anaximander, since the stylistic judgement o7ToqrCK07tE 'pocg o709s dvdLaaL a 'r&amp; A~ywv would naturally follow directly upon the quotation and not upon an insertion or paraphrase by Theophrastus. Admittedly, we find super- ficially similar phraseology in Theophrastus himself; for example, of Hera- clitus, rdew rw v Kalc Xpdov dopLcaTov.2 There may be an unconscious echo here, but what marks the phrase in Anaximander as original is the personification of Xpdvos. There is a very close parallel for this, as Jaeger has pointed out, in Solon fr. 24 Diehl, lines 1-7: crvYCOl 8Epvrpowq Tv o v ) E Lv CXpvlyayov ov 8oov vcrtov" rroAa p TrvXTE1Tav?'"s vrrpd rEv lpo' ovAEovra, v'" v AEvOE'pa.3 The idea of the 'trial conducted by time' is similar to that of the 'retribution according to the assessment of time' in Anaximander. With Kam' 7rV 70ToO It might be argued that Aristotle Phys. 1' 4. 203bI I, 7 6a7TELpov . . 7TEPLcXELV a7TaV7a Ka v7Tav7a Kv3Epvayv, KaC 7017ro EVtatL 7 OELOV, needs some explaining. How does the Bound- less 'govern' or 'steer' all things? By virtue, obviously, of surrounding or containing them; but what actual control can it exer- cise within the cosmos, if the idea of innumer- able destructions and re-creations is rejected ? The question is difficult to answer on any hypothesis; we cannot be absolutely sure, of course, that 7TEptLEXELV. . . KaL KV/PEPVyV, though perhaps an archaic phrase, is taken from or refers specifically to Anaximander. Heraclitus' fire steers all things (fr. 64), but that of course exists within the cosmos, to some extent. We cannot suppose that the Boundless as such interpenetrates the differ- entiated world. But presumably it may have been thought of by Anaximander as the ultimate source of the 3hCKq between oppo- sites on which the stability of the world de- pends. By enclosing the world, the Boundless prevents the expansion of differentiated matter; if there is thought to be any loss (which is doubtful), the Boundless would make it good. Possibly, if Anaximander thought of the Boundless as divine, he auto- matically gave it control, without deter- mining precisely how this control was to take effect. 2 McDiarmid, op. cit. 141 f., is won over by such similarities, and accepts the view of Dirlmeier, Rh.

What is assessed in the present case, however, is not so much the amount of retribution, for this is fixed on a pre-established pro- portional quantitative basis of restitution in full plus an indemnity. In any case Time does not control the amount, but rather theperiod in which the fixed pro- portion must be paid. Again, this does not imply, what would be improbable in itself, that the time-limit for payment must be fixed once and for all, the period the same and unchanging in every case.z Rather it implies one or both of two things: (a) that Time on each occasion will make an assessment of the period for repayment, for example a short period for an encroachment of night on day, a longer one for an encroachment of winter on summer; and (b) that Time has made a general assessment once and for all, to the effect that sooner or later in time the compensation must be paid. These ideas have partial analogies in Aeschylus; Choephoroe 648 ff., -rE'KVOv 8 ' E7TELUr0EEL 8d3OLws t-T0ov 7Taar-'pov I 7LVEw tv'Uao XpdV~ KATvr I fvrurudqpWV 'Epw-'s: here Xpdvc means 'in the fullness of time, sooner or later'; Supplices 732 f., XpCv, 70o KUpvp 7 V -'pt j EOVS &amp;T'owv LS' flpo/-v 8) 3EL C Kcrv: here Xpdvp, 'in time', is limited by the addition of KUpL4 7T' Ev qp'pat, 'the day fixed for payment'. In neither case, however, is Time itself in control. Earlier, in Solon, it is the inevitability of retribution that is stressed again and again-payment sooner or later, ravriws:, so at line 8 of fr. I Diehl, rrV-iws vr pov "AE 81K-q, or again at line 28, of the retribution of Zeus, dv-rw 38' d~ E9 Aos E6,Eqdrv. So too in fr. 24, quoted above, the indubitable meaning is that Earth justifies Solon's actions, because with the lapse of time she has become free. This, and not any predetermined time- limit, is what the 81Kr Xpvov implies there: formerly Earth was enslaved, now she is free. No more specific chronology is either implied or required. The analogy of Solon persuades me that this idea of inevitability lies also behind Anaximander's a Ka7 7 V 70ro Xp6vovU rJvw, though not, perhaps, to the exclusion of separate individual assessments. According to such an interpretation 81Kq, retribution, comes sooner or later, inevitably, among men according to Solon and among natural events according to Anaximander. No single mechanical time-cycle is in question; there are variations in the length of day and night, of summer and winter, of which Anaximander would be well aware. What mattered was that a particular encroachment should earn, eventually, an equivalent retribution: a drought, for example, be made good either by a series of wettish winters or by a single flood. So too Heraclitus allowed for Whether rd~Ls in the fragment means 'act of assessing' or 'objective assessment' (i.e. the result of an act of assessment) makes no material difference, as it happens, to the meaning. Jaeger approved the translation 'ordinance' (e.g. Paideia2, Eng. tr.3, Oxford, 1946, 159 f. and n. 50 on p. 455). A con- sideration of the meaning of nouns in -aLs in the Iliad and Odyssey suggests that the active meaning is more likely here. Professor D. L. Page drew the following conclusion from a review of the Homeric evidence which he kindly sent me: 'It is strongly suggested that a new -as formation, such as CrdfLS, will have been intended to denote the action of the verb, not its result, at least in archaic Greek.' But Jaeger's assumption that active uses were necessarily legal is discredited by the use of the verb, and the necessary supple- ment of the noun, in the tribute-lists; though even there (as indeed in Jaeger's examples from Plato, Politicus 305 c and Laws 925 b) it cannot be proved that the sense of the noun is active. 2 As, for example, in Empedocles fr. 30 .2: CS Tid 7 T aVpovae TEAhLOlevoLO XpdvOLo. Vlastos, C.P. xlii (1947), 161, n. 48, has no grounds for his assumption that Anaxi- mander's phrase must have had an equi- valent application to that of Empedocles here.</page><page sequence="17">SOME PROBLEMS IN ANAXIMANDER 37 flexibility in the balance of his natural changes, provided only that the total equilibrium of fire, water, and earth was not disturbed. So much, for the time being, for the problems; but clearly the assumption that Theophrastus was sometimes mistaken in his interpretation of Anaxi- mander requires justification. Theophrastus is regarded as infallible because, it has always been maintained, he had Anaximander's book in front of him. This is, in fact, nowhere asserted by Theophrastus or any other ancient source, and I shall outline some reasons for doubting whether Theophrastus had access to the complete works of a sixth-century Milesian like Anaximander. None of these reasons is compelling in itself, and the case must be regarded as a cumulative one. I. We know from the catalogue of his works preserved in Diogenes Laertius (5- 42-50) that Theophrastus wrote special monographs on Anaximenes, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, Diogenes, and Democritus, but not on Thales, Anaximander, or Heraclitus. It is at least a possibility that one motive for neglecting the last three was a dearth of original evidence. Of the thinkers to whom Theophrastus did devote monographs, only Anaximenes and Em- pedocles might not be obviously familiar in the Athens of the Sophists, and interest in Anaximenes was no doubt revived by Diogenes of Apollonia; while Empedocles had the advantage of using an easily propagated and less perish- able verse medium. With the decline of Miletus in the fifth century Anaxi- mander's book might very well have gone out of direct circulation, especially if it had never gained popularity on the mainland. 2. We do not know how much Thales committed to writing, but, whatever it was, neither Aristotle nor Theophrastus had direct knowledge of it. 3. The surviving fragment of Anaximenes, on whose Ionic dialect and style Theophrastus commented, is not only not in Ionic but also partly reworded. This may be due to Aetius, but it might well mean that Theophrastus did not always use the most original version of Anaximenes. 4. Theophrastus did not write a special study on Heraclitus: indeed, he ap- pears to have been comparatively ill-informed about him, and to cling closely to the Aristotelian interpretation. He ventured a stylistic or logical judgement, however: some of the things Heraclitus wrote were half-finished, LL-EAy, others were inconsistent. To us Heraclitus' surviving fragments do not give an impression of shoddiness: perhaps Theophrastus was handicapped by the nature of his source, which may well have been a mechanically-arranged selection of the odder sayings. Heraclitus is said to have deposited his book in the temple of Artemis at Ephesus; possibly this was an aetiological story to explain its absence from the Alexandrian library, since it would have been destroyed when the temple was burnt down in 356 B.C.1 5. In his de sensibus we possess a long extract from Theophrastus' doxo- graphical work. It is surprising that he could not find more to say about Heraclitus' views on sensation than he actually did, if he had a book by Heraclitus, or a complete collection of his pronouncements, in front of him. It is also plain that Alcmaeon, at all events, must have had more to say on the subject than he is credited with in the few lines on him in Theophrastus. 6. Diogenes Laertius mentions a summary exposition by Anaximander which See the index of Heraclitus, the Cosmic Fragments, s.v. 'Book' and 'Theophrastus'. Whether Heraclitus himself ever 'wrote a book' in the usual sense seems doubtful.</page><page sequence="18">38 G. S. KIRK he supposes Apollodorus to have come across, since the latter knew that Anaximander was sixty-four in 546 B.C. This does not prove, of course, that the whole of Anaximander was extant. On the contrary, Diogenes' statement that Anaximander 7rTErolyra 7 KEbLdaacw37 T-iv q 'EKOEcv (2. 2) suggests that Apollodorus somehow mentioned that his source for him was not, in Apollodorus' opinion, the original work. 7. It is clear that Theophrastus was relatively well informed on the astronomy, meteorology, and anthropogony of Anaximander. Yet on his arche Theo- phrastus was evidently vague. This is suggested (a) by the inadequacy of his account of the nature of -r oraEpov; (b) by what I have proposed to be a mis- interpretation of the fragment; and (c), perhaps, by the apparently puzzled phraseology in pseudo-Plutarch's version of Theophrastus, on the subject of Anaximander's cosmogony: [Plut.] Stromateis 2 iauit SE 7- EIK -rovB- Sovu ydv0oLov GEpIoI 7-E Kal vXpou KaI' 7T7V yEVEUv 70vSE TU KdT'O UOU G7rTOKpLG77vaL Kat 7va EKK roUToU Aoyol g cLopav 7rEptb7vaL .... These considerations indicate that we are not entitled automatically to assume that prose works written in Ionia in the sixth or early fifth century were still available in their entirety to Theophrastus. In the case of Anaximander I would suggest that what Theophrastus might have had in front of him was not a complete book but a collection of extracts, in which emphasis was laid upon astronomy, meteorology, and anthropogony rather than upon the nature and significance of -r o ELpov, which might always have seemed confusing. In respect of his arche, indeed, Anaximander must assuredly have been considered obsolete and unimportant by the end of the fifth century. The extant fragment could be quoted by Theophrastus, of course, because it really came among the cosmological-meteorological extracts. Trinity Hall, Cambridge G. S. KIRK</page></plain_text>
