<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction to Chimpanzee Behavior by Dr. Jane Goodall. 23 min., sound, color. Sale $310. Modern Film Rentals, 2323 New Hyde Park Rd., New Hyde Park, NY 11040. 1977. Those who know little about Dr. Good- all's pioneering field studies with wild chimpanzees in Gombe Park, Tanzania, should find this film informative and en- tertaining. It is the first in a series by the National Geographic dealing with her work and is a very basic introduction to the topic. A justification for such research, in terms of significance to man, is offered, and an historically valuable interview with the late Dr. Louis Leakey is included. Most of the film deals with the gradual acceptance of Dr. Goodall by the chimps and with illustrations of social interac- tions and daily activities among individ- uals of various ages and both sexes. The photography is for the most part of high quality. The sound track of the vocalization is excellent. Dr. Goodall's nar- ration conveys genuine concern and un- derstanding without being maudlin or anthropomorphic. However, it is low key and not particularly exciting or inspiring. The information is presented at a level which should be easily grasped by senior high school students or a general audi- ence. It should serve as a good springboard for discussion and speculation in zoology, psychology, and sociology classes. Col- lege students or professionals who have had previous exposure to her research will find this introduction less valuable. Later films in this series deal in detail with subjects touched upon in this overview. Edward R.
