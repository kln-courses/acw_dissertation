<plain_text><page sequence="1">2 POKOT CONCEPTS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE David Nyamwaya Introduction The material in this paper was collected during fieldwork among agricultural Pokot of Kenya. Most Pokot live in West Central Kenya (in West Pokot and Baringo Districts). Agricultural Pokot comprise about 75% of the whole of the Pokot in Kenya. Unlike their pastoral counterparts who depend mainly on their cattle, goats and sheep for a livelihood, agricultural Pokot grow maize, finger millet, sorghum and vegetables for food and in the higher altitudes, sunflower, potatoes and pyrethrum for cash. Pokot live in one of the least developed parts of Kenya. The communication network is very poor and few of them are employed outside the District. Until the sixties, Pokot lived in a "closed" district into and out of which movement was strictly controlled. Western institu tions and technology are only gradually being introduced into the area. This paper is a small section of a larger essay which is in progress, and I apologize for its failure to provide enough background material. Though disease occurs in all human populations, different societies perceive, interpret and respond to it and its effects variously, Most medical anthropologists (and others studying illness) today make a distinction between the terms "disease" and "illness". Kleinman for example says that we can call disease "any primary malfunctioning in biological and psychological processes" and illness "the secondary psychosocial and cultural responses to disease i.e. how the patient, his family, and social network react to this disease" (1979:8). Therefore throughout this paper, I use disease to refer to biological and psychological pathology in the human body as may be recognized by a clinician and illness as the cultural interpretation of disease. In trying to explain what Pokot regard as health, it is necessary to analyze their understanding (theory) of illness i.e. how they think it is caused and should be treated. Medical anthropological literature usually recognizes two major types of theories of illness in non western societies. These are termed the naturalistic and personalistic (Foster and Anderson 1978), the natural and supernatural (Murdock 1980), the naturalistic and supernatural or sociointerpersonal (Fabrega 1974). Societies are then divided between those whose theories of illness are</page><page sequence="2">3 either largely naturalistic or personalistic respectively. However, evidence from several places, especially in Africa, suggests that many societies have theories of illness with both naturalistic and personalistic elements. Evans-Pritchard (1937) points out that though Azande believe in witchcraft as a "cause" of illness, this does not mean that they do not accept natural causation, for, as he puts it, they did not Attempt to account for the existence of phenomena, or even the action of phenomena, by mystical causation alone. What they explained by witchcraft were the particular conditions in a chain of causation which related an individual to natural happenings (p.67). It is interesting therefore, to note that few studies following the Azande one have developed Evans-Pritchard's ideas regarding the causa tion of illness. Material from my Pokot study suggests that their view of illness combines both naturalistic and personalistic aspects in one theory of illness. This "unified" view of illness (Fabrega 1974) has also been shown to exist among the Mandari, Nyakyusa, Zulu and Gusii of Africa."'" Pokot seek to explain the causation of illness by referring to different realms of existence, which may be seen to affect the physio logical condition of a person. Though Pokot traditionally do not have the germ theory of disease as understood in Western medicine today, they conceive of most illnesses as stemming from physiological pathology, but capable of extending to embrace other facets of human existence. Hence, Pokot think that inter-personal and spiritual agencies can bear on an individual's health in a variety of ways. At a superficial level, Pokot explanations of illness appear to consist of a series of "causes" of a similar nature. Close examination of their notions of causation shows that they fall into three different but closely related categories. As will be shown presently, the operation of causal agents from the three categories does not imply the same degree of causation. The causa tion of most illnesses among Pokot is a dynamic, perocessual phenomenon, because though the physical symptoms of an illness may remain unchanged, the number of factors thought to be contributing to its causation may be seen to increase or decrease as it progresses. The three categories of causes which Pokot use to explain illnesses may be designated the physiological (or biological), interpersonal and spiritual. I choose to call the categories of causes "planes" in this</page><page sequence="3">4 discussion, because each one of them is slightly different from the other. The biological plane involves the "how" aspect of an illness. On this plane, Pokot are concerned with the mode of transmission of the natural cause(s) of illness into the human body. Such causes are seen to emanate from the physical environment, from sick human beings or as incipient in the process of ageing. To give an example, Pokot say that kakatan (malaria) is caused by the consumption of excessive amounts of sugar, being caught in heavy rain and some now attribute it to mosquito bites. "Cause" here is understood in the sense of transmission and not in the sense of the particular parasites (plasmodia) responsible for malaria. In this sense, Pokot say venereal diseases are caused by sexual intercourse. In explaining the "how" of an illness, Pokot give medical names to specific physical symptoms affecting a particular person. In this discussion, I shall refer to this as the primary defini tion of illness. The definition of an illness by Pokot does not stop at the "how" level; for certain, actually most, illnesses, a "why" explanation is also sought. The why explanation of illnesses involves both of or either of the two planes interpersonal and spiritual. When a "why" explanation is sought, the focus of attention shifts from the physical symptoms to interpersonal and/or spiritual conditions which are thought to contribute to the illness. For the why explanation, several sets of different physical symptoms, each set definable at the primary level, may be said to be due to the presence of a single, interpersonal or spiritual condition. Such a condition may be a sexual offence, a curse, a dishonoured oath, human feelings, evil spirits or Tororot. I call the "why" definition of illness the secondary definition, because a label is an additional description of an illness which already bears a specific name derived from its physical symptoms. Both chronic and acute illness can be given both primary and secondary definitions, though it is the former which are more likely to have this double definition. Table 1 is a list of some common diseases and the biological causes ascribed to them.</page><page sequence="4">5 Table 1 Diseases and their Biological Causation Illness kokikei (whooping cough) sonsarion (measles) kakatan (malaria) tinyon (common cold) termes (kala-azar) kayitan (diarrhoea) kata (venereal disease) Cause air, dust wind, contact sugar, milk, rain, mosquitoes rain, hot sun blood, milk bad food sexual intercourse At this point I should introduce the notion of multiple causality. Pokot say that several causal agents may be present in any single illness and that these agents may belong to one or more of the three planes - the biological, interpersonal and spiritual - of causation. On the biological plane, for example, a single episode of malaria may be said to be due to all of the causes I have listed above acting on the "patient" at the same time. Though in some cases only one of these causes is thought to be relevant in explaining an episode of malaria, on most occasions several of these factors are regarded as being involved. Such multiple causality is intra-plane, because a number of factors on one plane are seen to be involved in the causation of malaria. Multiple causality can also be seen to occur on the interpersonal plane. For example, an episode of illness which starts as malaria may be thought to also involve a number of interpersonal conditions. Pokot have moral rules Kirurut, which guide them in their interpersonal relations.Kirurut entails rights and obligations. According to Kirurut, quarrelling, theft from a fellow Pokot, homicide and sexual offences (chepores) should be avoided. If a person violates Kirurut rules, he or his children will be afflicted with illness. A person should not take an oath if he knows he is in the wrong. A person's illness may also be exacerbated by the actions and feelings of others. For example, with illness by performing chupo - cursing him - if he is a habitual social offender. An individual whose actions anger a whole community may be afflicted by what Pokot call eywei. Eywei is an interjection used when abominable behaviour is witnessed.Eywei is thus a feeling of horror, which need not be expressed verbally. For example, a youth who hits an</page><page sequence="5">6 old person for no apparent reason will cause the feeling of eywei. If several people feel eywei against an individual, any future illness affecting him will be said to involve eywei. Pokot also say that an individual can afflict another with illness by using pan. Pan involves the manipulation of medicines, words and various bodily actions so as to affect somebody at a distance with illness. Some pan involves only medicines while other types involve the doctoring of items belonging to the intended victim - hair, footprints or cloths. I find it difficult to describe pan as either witchcraft or sorcery (Middleton 1963) because it involves both. Pokot use only a single term ponin to describe the individual who causes Pan. Some pan is legitimate, when it is protective, but some is also illegitimate and condemnable, when it is used because of envy or hatred. Pan can be acquired from any ponin but is never inherited in the Azande fashion (Evans-Pritchard 1937). in this discussion therefore, I use the Pokot term because it is not easily translated into English. An episode of malaria may be thought to involve the effects of the curse, oath, eywei or pan all at the same time. When several of these interpersonal agents are thought to be involved, we have another type of intra-plane multiple causality, but of a different nature from the biological one. Causality on this plane is different because the designation of an illness as eywei or pan actually subsumes the biological plane of causality - because malaria for example, can be defined as ngoku while Pokot "know" that at the how level, it is caused by sugar etc. On the interpersonal plane, most illnesses are thought to involve ngoku which may be glossed as "sin". Ngoku is used to refer to the infringement of kirurut, moral rules. As I show later, causation on this plane usually implies moral connotations, as it involves the imputation of responsibility for an illness to the patient, his kin or other Pokot. Ngoku may be given as an explanation of an ill ness by the therapy managing group or by a diviner. It is therefore arguable that causation on the interpersonal plane differs from that on the biological plane not only because the former is thought to subsume the latter, but also because it involves the imputation of responsibility for an illness. Multiple causality can also occur within the spiritual plane of causation. On this plane, causation is thought to involve the agency of oi, onyetei and Tororot. These forces are sometimes thought of in</page><page sequence="6">7 anthropomorphic terms. Pokot say that Tororot (God) is the custodian of their moral rules. He expects to be prayed to and receive sacrifices from household heads and the community at large on certain occasions. He punishes social offenders and those who neglect their religious duties. Pokot say that the curse or eywei is effective because God wills it. Muma, as the Pokot call the oath, has its effect because God wills it. Oi are the ancestor spirits which both protect and punish offenders. Pokot use oi to refer to ancestor spirits as a collectivity or to individual ancestors. It is said that when an individual commits ngoku, ancestor spirits will punish him, usually with illness. Oi also afflict when the appropriate sacrifices and prayers to them have been neglected. onyet (pi. onyetei) are evil spiritual beings who move about invisibly afflicting people with illnesses arbitrarily. Pokot refer to the Biblical Satan as onyet. An illness may be attributed to oi and Tororot at the same time, because both punish infringement of ngoku. This is then multiple causality on the spiritual plane. So far I have been discussing intra-plane multiple causality. It is also possible to talk about inter-plane multiple causality. This occurs when both how and why causes are thought to be involved in an illness. When Pokot say that an illness involves ngoku, it is assumed that ngoku exacerbates an already existing illness. Multiple causality can be seen to embrace all the three planes of causation. Causation on the spiritual plane usually subsumes the other two planes. When Pokot say that an illness is "kechonu Tororot", the implication conveyed is that creator is punishing an offender who has committed ngoku. For example, people say that eywei, people's feelings, can afflict the offender with illness, but they would also say that eywei is effective because Tororot or oolu are the ultimate force. So causation involving the spiritual plane is a step further than that involving the inter personal. I wish to illustrate the principle of inter-plane multiple causality by describing a condition Pokot call Yomat. Yomat is a medical condition which a person gets by coming into contact with water in certain areas. It is thought to be due to a substance which enters the human body through water, mist or fog. Yomat can manifest itself through different sets of physical symptoms. It is said that it affects a person (or his children) when he has</page><page sequence="7">8 committed sins that are unknown to his kin and neighbours or when he has neglected his ritual duties. But Pokot go further to say that the illness is sent by Tororot as a reminder to the person that he has committed some sins unknown to his community. Yomat is treated by various medicines according to the specific symptoms manifested but also by the performance of a ritual called kilomat, described later. The person should also confess his hidden sins to the community before he will be pronounced til il "healthy". In seeking to explain how an episode of illness has been caused, Pokot usually begin with a primary definition of the illness. If the primary definition is not sufficient, they will then move onto the inter personal and finally to the spiritual planes. In this sense it can be argued that Pokot perceive illness as a dynamic and processual occurrence. There is a developmental element in this process, because explanations begin at the how of the illness but tend to be extended in most cases to encompass the interpersonal and spiritual, the why planes. Different categories of persons tend to explain the same physical symptoms by referring to interpersonal or spiritual forces which they think are relevant for the particular episode of illness. Close kin of the patient may see the involvement of malicious individuals as contributing to the patient's debility through the agency of pan. Neighbours with no kin links with the patient may say that the illness is due to punishment from Tororot for some hidden ngoku committed by the patient or kin. Yet others may claim that a curse invoked in the past is operative. Pokot are not concerned with the notion of planes as such, because all causal agents thought to be involved in a patient's illness have the same effect - they are debilitating. However Pokot are aware of the different planes of causation and the differences between the how and why aspects of illness as will be shown when I discuss treatment and prevention later on. The concept of multiple causation can be clarified by the use of diagrams. B stands for the biological plane of causation, H for the interpersonal and S for the spiritual. X represents one causal agent.</page><page sequence="8">9 Figure 1 Causation on Biological Plane (a) single cause S H t B - Insects Food (bad) Poisoning Weather Dust (b) intra-plane multiple causality S H ^ B XXX Figure 2 Causation on the Interpersonal Plane s H - Sexual offences Oath Curse Homicide Pan Eywei S A A H XXX H subsumes B Figure 2 Causation on the Spiritual Plane A A S X S XXX - Ancestor spirits (oi) - Evil spirits (onyetei) - God (Tororot) S subsumes both B and H</page><page sequence="9">10 Figure 3 represents the full-scale of causation. Pokot rarely mention all the causes that are thought tov be involved in an illness. They are most concerned with the explanation that is considered to be socially relevant. Biological causes are rarely mentioned in explanations of illness, not because they are unimportant, but because they are assumed to be common knowledge among Pokot. Pokot discuss the interpersonal and spiritual aspects of an illness in a lot of detail but show little interest in biological explanations. When it comes to treatment however, elimination of biological pathology is of major concern. Causation on the biological plane is viewed by Pokot in very specific terms - a particular set of physical symptoms is given a specific name and specific medicines are required. Causation on the interpersonal and spiritual planes on the other hand is rather diffuse. There is no fixed set of physical symptoms which is connected to a specific interpersonal or spiritual causal agent. The same physical symptoms can be linked to different interpersonal or spiritual causes at the same or different times depending on who is assessing the situation. The specificity of biological causation on the one hand and the diffuseness of the inter personal and spiritual causation on the other is best shown during treatment, which I deal with later. In summary, the salient feature of the Pokot view of illness is that it is a process which in most cases embraces more than one realm of existence. Any episode of illness may be thought to involve processual multiple causation. Having discussed how Pokot perceive illness is caused, I now turn to their concept of health. When a person is ill he is said to have semeu (pi. semewut), an illness. It is said that for him to be cured, the semeu must be removed. Semeu refers to both the primary and secondary definitions of illness. Kakatan is semeu, but so also is pan. Semeu refers therefore to either the biological phase of illness only or together with the interpersonal or spiritual elements if these are present. A person who has semeu is described as chirate(pl.chiriote). Literally chirate means a person who is ill. But the term implies that somebody is "out of order". It also refers to physical malfunctioning or to a person that is below an expected medical standard, which depends on age. An old Pokot who has a minor ailment is not necessarily described as chirate because a certain amount of malfunctioning in him</page><page sequence="10">11 is expected because of his age. The term is also used to refer to a disturbance in a person's normal social or economic functions. On enquiring about some uncompleted task, one may be told that it is chirate- meaning that the task has not been completed because of the presence of an illness. Kesopoi "to cause to recover" means to restore to life, or to re-activate. A person who has recovered is said to be kisop - restored, made whole or normal. A person is said to be kisop when his physical symptoms have disappeared; to be fully healed "tilil" he should resume his normal life - including the performance of social and economic roles. When this has happened, til il in "health" is said to prevail. Tililin is used to refer to an orderly situation in a family or a community, in the absence of sickness or social discord. The term implies cleanliness, purity and moral uprightness. Before ending this section on Pokot notions of health and illness, I wish to make brief remarks about the imputation of responsibility for an illness. On the first plane of causation, there is usually no blame imputed to human beings for the occurrence of the illness - nature takes the blame. However, if an illness on this plane is thought to result from negligence on the part of the patient or some other person, the patient or other person may be blamed. For example, when a person contracts a venereal disease, they are blamed for it because it shows that a sexual offence has been committed. When a child does not seem to be growing normally and loses much weight, the mother is blamed for not feeding the child well. On the second and third planes of causation, responsibility for the illness is in most cases imputed to the patient, his kin or other Pokot. The patient is blamed if he has committed ngoku, or neglected to perform requisite rituals if he is a household head. There is usually little agreement about who is to blame for an illness on these two planes. An illness may be thought to involve the effects of a curse invoked to punish a thief - but the patient or his kin will blame some other person. Illnesses that are from God are not blamed on Him, because He only metes out illness as a punishment for someone or a community that has committed an offence. In the foregoing, I have dealt with those medical conditions whose initial causation Pokot perceive to involve biological agencies,</page><page sequence="11">12 but with the potential of progressing to include interpersonal and/or spiritual causation. There are, however, a few medical conditions which are perceived to result solely from interpersonal and/or spiritual causation. I wish to explain this type of causation by referring to infertility and mental illness. Pokot say that it is unnatural for any human being to be infertile. It is said that both men and women are born potentially fertile. Should a couple fail to have children, it is said that the fertility of one of the partners has been tempered with. Infertility is thought to be caused by the intervention of malicious human beings using pan or as a result of a curse invoked on one or both of the partners (or their ancestors). Spirits oi and onyetei and also Tororot can cause infertility. Pokot do not say that infertility is due to some illness or congenital abnormality. When infertility occurs, the appropriate ritual should be carried out so as to "open the womb". It is usually the woman who is blamed for barrenness - but not in all cases. Pokot know for example that some men are incapable of impregnating if they are impotent. The appropriate ritual is performed to cure infertility, but medicines should also be given by a herbalist. There are some herbalists who claim to specialize only in dealing with infertility. In the case of infertility therefore Pokot think that human or spiritual agencies can somehow affect natural processes in the human body. These agencies are seen to be capable of causing a condition (infertility) which is biological and necessitating both drug and ritual therapy. A person with a mental problem among Pokot is termed chepiyu, a term which covers a wide range of conditions from mild psychological disturbances to complete madness. The degree of a person's mental illness is indicated by the use of adjectives. Pokot say that there are two major types of chepiyu. One type of chepiyu is said to develop from any disease which "enters the head" and "spoils it". Such mental illness is . treated with material medicines only. However, the majority of chepiyu cases result from the agency of human beings or spirits. Like infertility, a mental illness may be perceived to result solely from interpersonal or spiritual causation, for example a curse, pan or oi. A person with this type of mental illness should be treated by material medicines and the performance of appropriate ritual, as determined by the causation thought to be involved.</page><page sequence="12">13 It should be stressed here that these medical problems Pokot perceive to stem from interpersonal and spiritual causation (excluding the first plane of causality) are regarded to be just like any other semeu. The fact that biological causation is not seen to be involved does not make such illnesses less real to Pokot than say a disease like malaria. That this is so has wide implications for the provision of health services to Pokot. It would seem that health services in the Pokot view must of necessity include a consideration of those social and spiritual processes which they consider pathological but which the biomedical view of disease may consider to be insignificant. They see a direct causal relationship between interpersonal and spiritual forces and biological processes in the human body. The view of i.llness I have analyzed is shared by both lay Pokot and their medical specialists. The latter, however, in most cases possess esoteric knowledge regarding the technicalities of treatment - but in carrying out treatment, the specialists make reference to the general theory of illness. The esoteric knowledge which the traditional healers have does not constitute an alternative view of illness. The ideas which specialists have regarding appropriate therapy differ depending on the various types of healers - individual healers within a single category can possess knowledge which is their own - and this is especially so for the herbalists - who tend to have individual repertoire. The Pokot situation is therefore different from that reported for some Asian societies where professional and lay views of illness which are quite different exist in a single society (cf. Kleinman 1980, Leslie 1976). Though the general view of illness as a multi-causal process is rarely openly rejected by Pokot, individuals often express scepticism regarding specific agencies of causation and the efficacy of certain rituals. Informants for example, expressed doubts as to whether pan and ngoku can cause disease. Scepticism regarding specific aspects of the Pokot view of illness seems to be on the increase, especially among younger educated Pokot. This scepticism is best inferred from the way such Pokot respond to actual cases of illness in which they or their kin are involved.</page><page sequence="13">14 Treatment and Prevention The principles of treatment and prevention held by Pokot follow logically from their theory of causation of illness. Treatment may involve actions directed at the biological, social or spiritual aspects of human life. The different planes of causation necessitate correspond ing therapeutic responses. The first form of treatment applied to a patient is usually directed at the physical self. This type of treatment is referred to as kito sakt which literally means "giving medicines". Kit'6 sakt involves materia medica considered appropriate to the physical symptoms. The medicines may be herbal concoctions, shop patent drugs or hospital medicine. Physiotherapy, child delivery, tooth extraction and all forms of surgery deal with the physical aspects of the patient. If intra-plane multiple causality is believed to be operative, different medicines appropriate to the different causes are given to the patient. Treatment on this plane may be accompanied with regulations about food, movement and exposure to the natural environment. A patient with malaria is given purgatives and emetics and nowadays, chloroquin. He should abstain from all sugary foods and drink plenty of goats' soup. On this plane then, treatment may be described as empirical and there is thought to be a direct relationship between the medicine and the illness. Bitter medicines are regarded to be more effective in treating an illness. In fact most people think chloroquin is effective in the treatment of malaria because of its bitter qualities. For the same reason, many Pokot prefer injections to tablets (or other oral medicines). The pain effected by the injection is regarded to have the same effect on the illness. Besides kit'o sakt, Pokot perform various types of rituals to effect complete cure. "Tum" (pl. tumwoi) is the term used for any ritual whether this is connected with illness or not. When an illness is considered to involve either or both the interpersonal and the spiritual planes of causation, a specific tum may be performed. The tum performed depends on an assessment of the social and spiritual environment to determine which conditions need redressing. Most rituals performed when an illness occurs have a wide spectrum of intended action. One ritual for example can be performed to deal with a number of conditions which are thought to be involved in the illness. During the performance of any ritual, Pokot may attempt to deal with several interpersonal relations and spiritual forces. Indeed one ritual may be performed because of the</page><page sequence="14">15 occurrence of many illnesses at the same time in one family. Sometimes, illness may be incidental to the performance of a ritual aimed at general misfortunes in a family or the community at large. Treatment on the interpersonal and spiritual planes is not as specific as on the biological plane. Though kito sakt usually precedes turn in Pokot treatment, both are considered essential to enable a patient to be fully healed. Tum usually continues even when kitö sakt has been performed. Pokot say that the reason for tum is to cure the patient by removing the social or spiritual forces thought to contribute to biological pathology. However, as I argue later it may also be important in leading to the removal, or at least the exposure, of socio-spiritual pathology. But Pokot stress that ritual, where required in the treatment of a patient, should not be neglected because this may invalidate the effect of medicines. Failure to perform tum in an illness can itself be seen as ngoku, and therefore capable of afflicting people with further illness. Line treatment, prevention of illness involves the physical, interpersonal and spiritual aspects of a person's life. Pokot believe that the body needs to be strengthened with medicines to prevent the occurrence of disease. This is done by the use of a wide variety of materia medica the commonest of which is called moykut, which every household should possess. Periodically the household head prepares and dispenses to each member a mixture of over ten different substances (plants) in a session called ighat. This mixture is believed to possess prophylactic qualities. Plenty of goat's soup is drunk during ighat and is also regarded as a necessary ingredient needed for strengthening the body. Proper social conduct should be maintained through the observance of moral rules. Harmonious interpersonal relationships are also regarded as necessary for healthful living. Pokot are expected to refrain from harbouring bitter feelings against one another as doing so may exacerbate illness. Pokot also, emphasize the importance of appropriate prayers and sacrifices to their Creator. As already pointed out, failure to worship God through prayer and sacrifice can lead to affliction with illness. The ancestors should also be propitiated with appropriate gifts. The homage due to ancestors is however more of veneration than worship. The observance of social and spiritual rules is regarded as an important aspect of the endeavour to prevent the occurrence of illness. It complements</page><page sequence="15">16 the use of medicines thought to have prophylactic powers. Some Pokot now know that vaccination can prevent various illnesses - in fact many mothers at Chepareria indicate their desire to have as many of their children immunized as possible. The idea of immunization does not seem completely new to Pokot, because many regard it as a form of ighat. In concluding this discussion about Pokot concepts of health and illness and how the latter should be treated and prevented, I wish to point out that their theory approximates to what in psycho somatic medical literature is called the "unified view" of illness. According to this view of illness Not only are the manifestations or expressions of what we term disease seen as interconnected and hierarchically organized, but in addition, the determinants of disease are also conceptualized holistically. Disease is seen as a natural consequence of man's open relationship with his physical and social environment. Thus cause is multi factorial, processes are interconnected, and manifesta tions are multifaceted (Fabrega 1974:140). Pokot are not alone in viewing health and illness holistically. The Tiv view illness as closely related to relationships between kin, and matters pertaining to the control of land but as Price-Williams notes, disease as a biological state is recognized by them (1962:125). Among some American Indians, bodily and moral affliction is regarded as an indicator of moral transgression against societal norms. Man is thought of as continuous with both the social and non-social aspects of his environment, and that what happens in his surroundings affects his bodily well-being. Not only a person's own actions, but also those of others around him can cause disease. Hughes in Logan and Hunt (1978:152). The Mandari, Zulu and Nyakyusa share the same view of illness with Pokot. This view of illness implies a concept of health that is more than just the absence of physical disease. However, unlike some other societies, notably the Azande in Africa, Pokot do not think that any single force (for example witchcraft among the Azande), is the ultimate cause of all illnesses. Enter Western Medicine Since the late twenties, agricultural Pokot have had some exposure to Western medicine. Those of them who have gone to school have some idea of the germ theory of illness. However, to a large</page><page sequence="16">17 extent, the indigenous understanding of the causation of illness persists. Even Pokot who have gone to school or have become Christians still believe in the interpersonal and spiritual causation of illness. This traditional conception of illness does not of course prevent Pokot from utilizing Western therapy whose efficacy has been demonstrated to and perceived by them. Western medicine is perceived as capable of dealing with the "how" phase of illness but not the "why" planes. Western health workers are placed in the same category as the indigenous herbalists, birth attendants, tooth extractors and physiotherapists. Christian prayers for the sick are thought to have the same effect as Pokot curative rituals. Pokot diviners, prophets and ritual experts are thought to intervene at a higher level than Western health workers and the other indigenous healers already listed. Western medicine is seen by Pokot as an addition to the therapeutic options they had before it was intro duced. Pokot use the term daktarion to refer to Western health workers, but the term falls under the generic term chepsaktian which is used to refer to medical practitioners in general, traditional or Western. At the cognitive level, the distinction which matters to Pokot is not that between traditional and Western medicine, but that between kitö sakt and turn therapy. In illness behaviour, either traditional or Western medicine can be used for the "how" aspects of illness, but the latter is thought unsuitable for the interpersonal and spiritual aspects of illness. There is no necessary conflict between the two types of therapy of the nature suggested by proponents of conflicts models in the study of the interaction between indigenous and Western therapy in developing countries (cf. Foster and Anderson 1978). At the institutional level, Western and Pokot therapy are independent and separate entities. This is because the Kenyan Govern ment right from the Colonial period, does not recognize, let alone support, indigenous forms of therapy. Though ordinary Pokot in most cases can use either form of therapy, Western health workers in the area do not accept the role played by indigenous health practitioners in the health-seeking process. Those indigenous healers who deal with the biological aspects of illness now realise that they are competing with Western medical practitioners and this has led to their adopting various strategies in response to the change. A detailed discussion of these strategies is however beyond the scope of this article.</page><page sequence="17">18 In concluding, I wish to stress that the Pokot theory of illness is quite plastic. It does not provide details about the type of therapy that should be utilized when an illness breaks out. What it does is to provide guidelines as to variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be resorted to. The theory does not therefore impose strict limitations on therapeutic responses. On the contrary, it facilitates varied responses to any one medical condition. Because of the flexibility of their concepts of health and illness, Pokot tend to be more concerned about the efficacy, rather than the theoretical correctness of treatment actions.
