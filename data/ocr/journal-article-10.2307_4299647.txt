<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT BABA JAN: THE POTTERY AND METAL FROM LEVELS III AND II By Clare Goff The pottery from Phases II and III at Baba Jan has already been described briefly in previous articles.1 In this, the final report, I propose to stop referring to the Painted and Plain Common Wares, typical of Level III as genre Luristan wares, but to use the terms Baba Jan III Painted and Plain Com- mon Wares. The other types of ware from Phase III described in Goff Meade, Iran VI, pp. 115-16, will be referred to as Baba Jan III Heavy Common, Pithos and Cooking Wares respectively. In Phase II the new wheel-made pottery, which suddenly appears, will be referred to as Baba Jan II Imported Ware, since to call it " Nush-i Jan ware " may imply too close a relationship. Baba Jan III Wares-Stratigraphical Divisions Painted Baba Jan III wares and their plain equivalents first appear in Level 3 on the Central Mound, and continue throughout Levels III and II on the East Mound. The sequence can be divided for convenience into three main phases: Early: Central Mound Levels 1-3 Middle: East Mound, Level III, Fort and Painted Chamber lowest floors Late: East Mound Squatting Levels, II D-A The Early and Middle phases may overlap, for it is not possible to ascertain the exact relationship of Level I on the Central Mound to Level III on the East Mound. Levels 2 and 3 on the Central Mound are certainly earlier than anything on the East Mound,2 and Manor I must have been abandoned before the start of Phase II, for it hardly contains a sherd of the new Imported Ware, characteristic of the Squatting Levels. The Manors on the Central Mound were denuded down to foundation level, and most of the pottery was found in the form of sherds. A few reconstructable jars are illustrated on Fig. I, but otherwise it is difficult to get a clear idea of the repertoire of shapes characteristic of this early phase. The situation is quite different on the East Mound. Level III was burnt, and the mud-brick walls left standing. The inhabitants escaped, leaving their belongings scattered around on the floors. In the main living rooms, 3 and 5, the floors were covered with what must be assumed to be the full pottery complement of the family who lived there. As well as vast quantities of broken pithoi, there were elaborately painted jars and bowls and plainer utilitarian jugs and mixing bowls. The " ceremonial rooms ", i.e. the Central Hall (Room 4) and the Painted Chamber, seem to have been kept relatively clean of domestic debris, but even here and in the courtyards large fragments of reconstructable pots survived. 1 This article should be read in conjunction with my three preliminary reports: Goff Meade, " Luristan in the First Half of the First Millennium B.c.", Iran VI (1968), pp. 105-34, particularly p. I 5 f., which describe the pottery; Goff, " Excavations at Baba Jan, i967 ", Iran VII (1969), pp. I 15- 30; Goff, " Excavations at BabaJan, 1968 ", Iran VIII (1970), pp. 141-56, particularly p. 142 which summarizes the strati- graphy and pp. I51-5 on the Level II pottery. Goff, " Exca- vations at Baba Jan: the Architecture of the East Mound ", Iran XV (1977), pp. 57-90 gives a detailed description of the East Mound stratigraphy and the location of all the trenches. 2 The building techniques of Manor I are similar to those used in the Fort and Painted Chamber. In the earlier Manor 2, a different type of stone foundation was used. Some of the most elaborate Central Mound pottery with little animals painted on it, comparable to that from Level III on the East Mound, was found in Trench X, cut down the West slope. This sug- gests that most of the latest deposit on the summit had been ploughed out and washed down the slope. 29 4</page><page sequence="2">30 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES We are equally fortunate in the Late Phase. A second catastrophe overtook the settlement at the end of Level IIB, and once again the inhabitants took to the hills leaving their belongings behind them. In the " Groom's Kitchen " and the " Carpenter's Shop " we have collections of complete vessels, showing clearly how the domestic pottery repertoire had changed with the decline of the mound and the advent of the new Imported Wares at the beginning of Level II. Similar, but less well stratified, caches of pottery were found in Level II in the kitchen at the back of the Painted Chamber, in Room 20, and in Trenches L and LW which represent the upper Levels of the Groom's Kitchen and Rooms 8 and 9. The bulk of these last appear to be IIA with a small IIB admixture. Finally, several lovely pots were found in small " search and destroy " trenches dug round the foot of the Central Mound to try to ascertain the limits of the mound and the location of the graveyard. Apart from the two vessels found in the Grave in P (Fig. 9: 22, 23), none of these vessels appears to be associated with burials or elaborate architecture, and it is obvious that a great deal more excavation is needed to elucidate the settlement that originally surrounded the major buildings. Baba Jan III Common Wares: Fabric As described in an earlier report (Goff Meade, Iran VI, p. I 6), the ware is of a medium thickness (7-8 mm.), hard, strong, well-levigated with inclusions, which range from barely visible sand particles to crushed grits. It breaks with a fairly even fracture and is either hand-made or thrown on a slow wheel. Mica tempering, so common in the Imported Wares of Level II, never occurs. The colour varies from off-white through cream to peach, pale orange to a light reddish brown, though a warm buff is the shade most frequently occurring. The surface is normally wet smoothed, and often several shades lighter than the interior, and there is occasionally definite evidence for a slip. The finer frag- ments are normally burnished, and in the Early and Middle Phases, painted as well. During Phase II there is a definite falling off in the quality of the ware, possibly because of the fashion for Imported Wares from the east, and also undoubtedly because of the decline of the Baba Jan III civilization. Plain common ware vessels with a coarse tempering of crushed rock, which results in a pitted and uneven surface, becomes common; so too do sherds from dirty-buff unburnished jars and bowls of the simplest type, and it is difficult to decide whether the few finer sherds occurring in the later assemblages were manufactured then or are intrusive from earlier periods. For examples see Pl. IIIb and c. Baba Jan III Wares-Main Pottery Types With three exceptions, all our Phase III pottery comes from occupation deposits. Certain types of vessels, well known from museums and private collections, are not well represented at Baba Jan. Since privately acquired vessels almost certainly came from graves, we can deduce that some vessels were made for funerary purposes. This becomes clear when one looks at the vessel considered most typical of genre Luristan collections, the beak-spouted jar with twisted basket handle, side handle and, frequently, a bull or ibex head above the spout. We found only one almost complete example and that in a grave (Fig. 9: 22; P1. IIa; for a better illustration see Goff, Iran VIII, Fig. 7: Io). Spout and handle fragments from simi- lar vessels occur infrequently in some of the occupation deposits from all three phases (Fig. 8: 4, 24, and perhaps Fig. I 1: 46). However, since our single example was broken in antiquity before it was buried, these pots were obviously not manufactured simply to be placed in graves, but must have been used, perhaps in some ceremony, first. The same may be true of another common museum type, the teapot with tubular spout and basket handle. Again, the only fairly complete example (yet lacking spout and handle) was found not in an occupation deposit but blocking a hole in the wall of Room 3 (Fig. 5: 2: for location, see Goff, Iran XV, p. Io9). Handle and spout fragments occur occasionally in Level III on both Central and East Mounds (Fig. 4: 16, I7, I8, 22, 29; Goff Meade, Iran VI, Fig. Io: 4), but they are rare on the East Mound and are never found in Level II. Other types of small jugs are represented by spout fragments from the Central Mound (Fig. 4: 23, 24, 25).</page><page sequence="3">EXCAVATIONS AT BABA JAN: POTTERY AND METAL FROM LEVELS III AND II 31 Large bowls with trough spouts and horizontal handles and deep pots with trough spouts and vertical handles are well represented throughout Levels III and II at least as late as IIB. (Bowls: Fig. 2: I, Manors; Fig. 4: 31, outlying trench on eastern flank of Central Mounds; Fig. 9: 8, a slightly different type from Level II. Pots: painted-Fig. 8: 2, from outlying trench north-east of Central Mound; unpainted- Fig. Io: 12 and P1. Ic, Groom's Kitchen IIB; Goff Meade, Iran VI, Fig. IO: 17, Carpenter's Shop IIB). It seems that the large, unpainted, spouted pot was a standard piece of domestic equipment in Level IIB, since another complete example was found in the II cache in Room 2o and a third in Trench E. The type of painted decoration on Fig. 8: 2 dates it probably to the period of the Fort and Painted Chamber, so perhaps the deep spouted pot is a slightly later type, gradually superceding the bowl. On the other hand, a great many elaborately decorated body sherds from wide mouthed pots were found in the Manor deposits. They must either have come from similar spouted vessels or from deep pots with paired handles, of which the only complete example was found in IIB (Fig. Io: 17. An earlier example from the Central Mound is an unusual carinated type and may be an import. See Fig. 4: 32). Another impressive type is the large jar with two opposed handles, one in the shape of an animal, the other crowned with a flat knob. These vessels are always elaborately decorated with variations on the " kite " theme. At least one of these jars was found on the Level III floor of every major living room of the Fort (Fig. 5: Io, and perhaps 7, from Room 3; Fig. 6: I, from the White Room; Fig. 6: Io, from Room 5; Fig. 8: I I, from Room 4; Fig. 8: I6, from Room 2). Their presence on the Central Mound is attested by the odd handle (Fig. 4: 9-1 I, also Goff Meade, Iran VI, Fig. 6: 20), but they do not seem to have been common there. They are not found in Level II. These elaborate spouted vessels and large handled jars are not, however, typical of the pottery assemblages as a whole. The majority of sherds, particularly in the earliest phase on the Central Mound, belong to simple jars, simple bowls, and cups. Simple jars, with wide belly, slim neck and flaring, pinched or slightly grooved rims, and ornamented with pendent triangles or kites, occur in great profusion on the Central Mound (Fig. I, passim.). None of the complete, or semi-complete vessels discovered have lugs or side handles, though a few sherds attest to their existence (Fig. 4: 1-6, I4). This type of jar is also common on the lowest level of the East Mound and continues into the beginning of Level II (Fig. 5: 4, 5, 8; Fig. 6: 4, 5; Fig. 8: 17, early II; Fig. 9: I9, early II and possibly an heirloom from Level III). At the same time, perhaps fortuitously, complete examples of jars with single vertical handles or paired lugs also become rela- tively common, particularly in Level II (Fig. 9: I8, IID; Fig. Io: I, I6, IIB; Fig. 8: 3, IIA but possibly an heirloom from an earlier level). Plain Baba Jan III jar rims and body sherds are common to all phases of Level II. Small bowls, usually with a slightly inverted rim and horizontal handle, decorated with " ladders " or varieties on the pendent triangle theme, are found in their hundreds throughout the top three levels of the Central Mound (Fig. 2: 2-26), and the type is also common on the bottom level of the East Mound (Fig. 5: 9; Fig. 6: 6-9; Fig. 8: 22). It persists until Level IIA (Fig. 9: i; Fig. I2: 12). However, two new developments take place: the bowl becomes deeper with sinuous sides (Goff Meade, Iran VI, Fig. 1o: 23 and Iran XVI, Fig. 8: I4; Fig. 9: 21); the ladder designs also become bolder (Fig. 6: 8; Fig. 7: 14, 23; Fig. 9 9 and 23; Goff Meade, Iran VI, Fig. 10: 23, 27). Small bowls with spouts sometimes occur in private collections but are not definitely attested at Baba Jan. Other bowl shapes are far less common. A deep flaring sided bowl or cup occurs rarely at the top of the Central Mound deposits (Fig. 2: 37; Goff Meade, Iran VI, Fig. 6: 5). Some of these examples may terminate in equally rare pedestals (Fig. 2: 38). They may be the prototypes for the sinuous sided bowls on the East Mound, also for the crude plain-ware carinated bowls, which occur in the upper levels of Level II (Fig. I1i: 24). Flower pots, i.e. bowls with straight, flaring sides, usually ornamented with an animal-headed lug, occur only in the earliest phase on the Central Mound, but then are relatively common (Fig. 2: 27, 33, 34, 36). Examples also occur both in painted and plain wares with thickened rims and horizontal handles (Fig. 2: 28-3I, 35). Cups, normally with a single, horizontal handle, occur in a variety of forms in Phase II of the Central Mound (Fig. 4: I9, Goff Meade, Iran VI, Fig. 6: 9, Io, I I). Again they seem to form a standard</page><page sequence="4">32 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES piece of domestic equipment on the East Mound, occurring in practically every major living room in Level III and again in Level II. The usual form in these later phases is sinuous sided, and roughly the size of the modern half pint mug (Fig. 5: 3; Fig. 6: 4 ?; Fig. 7: 5; Fig. 8: 5?; Fig. I o: 9, Io, IIB; Fig. 12: 3, I5, IIA). Designs Many of the finer common ware vessels3 are decorated with a thick reddish-brown matt paint, normally applied after the vessel has been burnished. The colour ranges from dark brown through reddish-brown to a pale green on vitrified, overfired vessels. I have already discussed the repertoire of designs in great detail in my doctoral thesis4 and more briefly in an earlier report (Goff Meade, Iran VI, p. 118). They are in any case obvious from the illustrations. More recent seasons of excavation have enabled us tentatively to relate certain designs to phases of the sequence. The early phase is distinguished by some very precise hatching and cross hatching on the ubiquitous pendent triangles and kites, though wilder, slap-dash artists were working at the same time (e.g. Fig. I: 1-4, 7 contrast No. I9). There is a great variety of bolder designs on the equally ubiquitous, shallow bowls (Fig. 2: passim). By the middle phase the pottery reaches its zenith. Jars such as Fig. 5: 4, Fig. 6: I, Fig. 8: 2 and Fig. 9: I9 (from IID but perhaps made earlier) achieve a high degree of invention and technical excellence. At the same time a tendency to simplify some of the designs and use bold chiaroscuro effects seems to be creeping in. The horizontal " ladder " designs, that delineate the pattern zones or surround the rims of the small bowls, become wider, and the " rungs " thicker, rectangular blocks of paint (Fig. 5: 4; Fig. 6: 8; Fig. 7: 23; Fig. 9: 2I; Goff Meade, Iran VI, Fig. io: 23, 27). Both types of ladder sometimes occur in combination on the same vessel (e.g. Fig. 9: 21) and can be used tentatively to date jugs like Fig. 8: 2 found in a " Search and Destroy " trench in an unstratified context. This jug also indicates how designs were often outlined in a fine brush and then filled in in a slightly more watery paint giving an attractive, two-toned effect. Exactly the same technique of outlining and then filling in was used by the tile painters. Pendent triangles can also be blocked in in place of the laborious hatching (Fig. 5: 3), and such motifs as rows of blocked-in diamonds make their appearance (Fig. 8: Io). The fashion for simplified designs appears to start on the Central Mound but is rare there (Fig. 2: 9, 37).5 On the other hand, as might be expected, they are common in Level II, for good examples turn up in the Groom's Kitchen (Fig. Io: I, 9) and elsewhere in the squatting levels (Fig. 8: I4; Fig. 9: 4, 8). The decoration of Fig. Io: I is unique in that the design is divided into two registers of equal importance, instead of the more usual arrangement whereby rosettes or circles are combined with pendent triangles in a single register covering most of the side of the pot as in Fig. 9: 9. A rather similar arrangement is used in the unstratified jar illustrated in Fig. 8: I. (See also P1. IIa.) How far the more elaborate type of painted vessel continued to be manufactured in Level II is an open question. Sherds, and fragmentary vessels of the older types continue up to IIA and are common in the erosion level between Levels IIA and I (Fig. 12: I2, 15, 16; Fig. 9: I), but, since the environs of the settlement must have been covered with painted fragments, this is hardly significant. More to the point, there are only two painted vessels in the sealed IIB deposit of the Groom's Kitchen, and none at all in the Carpenter's Shop.6 Apart from the broken cup or jug (Fig. I2: I5), which had a worn surface and was probably made much earlier than its IIA find spot would warrant, the only semi- complete painted vessel from IIA was found scattered all over the excavation (Fig. 8: 3, 6 and probably Fig. 9: I). The quality of both fabric and design are in sharp contrast to the bulk of the Common Wares from this level, and it seems more likely that it is a survival from the middle phase than of contemporary manufacture. On this reading of the situation, painted pottery is becoming rare by IIB and dies out altogether thereafter. 3 Careful sherd counts were kept but the results are inconclusive and it is impossible to summarize the evidence in the space available. Very briefly the proportion of Plain to Painted Common Wares increases the later one gets into the sequence. 4 Goff, New Evidence of Cultural Development in Luristan in the Late Second and Early First Millennia B.C., Ph.D. thesis submitted to the University of London in June 1966, p. 175 f. SFig. 2: 9 in particular is apparently from Level 2, but is so atypical that one wonders if it was not misplaced in the sherd grid. 6 For a complete inventory of the pottery in these two deposits, see the catalogue for Fig. Io.</page><page sequence="5">EXCAVATIONS AT BABA JAN: POTTERY AND METAL FROM LEVELS III AND II 33 Heavy Common Ware and Storage Vessels7 Only two virtually complete pithoi were found during the excavations (Fig. I I: I; Goff Meade, Iran VI, Fig. 6: 22). A mass of fragments from similarly ribbed heavy jars was found on the III floor level of Rooms 3 and 5 in the Fort. The most typical rim form is heavy and slightly thickened, with a flat top (Fig. 8: I8; Fig. I2: 5, IID/C), but Fig. 3: 40-2 and 46-8 and Fig. 7: 9, illustrate further examples. Bases are illustrated in Fig. 3: 33, 34, 36, and the ribbing on P1. IIc. Deep pots with thickened rims, ornamented either by a lug or vertical handle, are common in all three phases of Level III. Rim sherds occur frequently on the Central Mound (Fig. 4: 33-9), and complete examples were found in both Rooms 3 and 5 of the Fort (Fig. 7: 3, 8) and in Level IIB in the Groom's Kitchen (Fig. Io: 2, P1. Ib). Rim sherds from this type of vessel continue to occur till the top of Level II deposits (Fig. 9: 2). Most of these pots are made from the same, characteristic, gritty paste with a whitish, slipped surface, wet-smoothed and occasionally burnished, as if they were all made at one centre and distributed around the province. Another characteristic form, occurring at least from the middle phase onwards, is the jar with a single vertical handle. (Handles were found in the Central Mound but not complete handled vessels.) Complete examples were found on the floors of Rooms 3 and 5 of the Fort (Fig. 7: 2, 4), and the type continues into Level IIB (Fig. I o: 15; Fig. I 1: 45). A complete jar with knobbed base, perhaps designed to be balanced on a wood or metal stand, was found on the East Mound in Trench D, IID/C (Fig. 12: 6, P1l. IVc). Numerous base fragments of related shape occur on the Central Mound, e.g. Fig. 3: 28. Far more common, however, are flat or knobbed bases with a small central hole (Fig. 3: 37-40), which serve to date the complete jar of this type found in a doubtfully stratified context on the East Mound (Fig. I2: I7). Both types of jar have a small shoulder lug, or horizontal handle with a small hole near one end-a feature repeated in the fragmentary example from IIB (Fig. 8: 2). In Level I this hole develops into a short spout, and this shoulder handle and spout combination continues at least to the fifth century, turning up at Persepolis.8 My workmen suggested that these jars might have been used as flowerpots for growing plants. It seems more likely that they too were used as storage vessels, perhaps for cheese or some other substance that needed to be able to drain away from the base. Coarse Cooking Wares are invariably dark and friable with closely-packed, black or brown grits. They range in colour from reddish brown to black, and the exterior is often patchy and smoke-blackened. The most frequently occurring shape is a deep, more or less hole-mouthed pot, usually provided with a lug or lugs at the rim, and very rarely, a spout. Rim sherds are particularly common on the Central Mound (Fig. 3: 1-16), and the type persists, though becoming less common, till the top of Level IIIA (Fig. 12: 15). Other types, which occur infrequently, appear to ape the shapes of the common wares. They include deep pots with everted rims (Fig. 3: I8-Io), jars (Fig. 3: I7), bowls with clay buttons on the rim (Fig. 3: 21, 12), cups (Fig. 3: 24, 25) and flower pots (Fig. 3: 26, 27). In IIB we have a lugged jar (Fig. Io: 16, P1. Id) and crude bowls (Fig. I2: 40). At the top of Level II, in IIA, coarse ware is used for a vertical-handled jar and an unusual storage vessel (Fig. 12: 2, 4). Grey Wares Common Wares are occasionally grey with darker grey paint, but this must be due to an accident in firing. Otherwise there appear to be three types of Grey Ware, all occurring in minute quantities and presumably imported from elsewhere.9 From the Manors come a few sherds of a fine, wheelmade, pale grey ware with a smoothed surface and plastic decoration: ribs, excisions and grooves (Fig. 4: 26-8 and perhaps 29 if this is not grey Common Ware). 7 For a description of the fabric see Goff Meade, Iran VI, p. I16, " Medium Ware " and catalogues. 8 E. F. Schmidt, Persepolis II: Contents of the Treasury and Other Discoveries (Chicago, O.I.P. LXIX, I957), pl. 73: 4. 9 The wares can probably be used to link Baba Jan with Hasanlu and Sialk but the absence of comparative material here in Cyprus makes me hesitate to point out any definite parallels.</page><page sequence="6">34 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES From Level III of the Courtyard of the East Mound comes a single sherd of hand-made, grey ware with large grits and a rather uneven surface. Its antecedents are puzzling since it has a typical Level III " kite " design incised on the surface with a blunt point. Finally from Rooms 3 and 5 of the Fort come two vessels with a mottled, greyish-buff surface, polished so highly that it is difficult to say if the pots are wheel or hand-made, though the former is more likely. Both vessels have a characteristic decoration of shallow, parallel grooves (Fig. 5: I; 6: 3). External Comparisons The affinities of the Baba Jan III culture have already been discussed in great detail in my thesis and summarized in an earlier article.10 The only new corpus of Iron Age pottery from Western Luristan published since then is from the Pusht-i Kuh cemeteries. Professor Vanden Berghe's descriptions of the pottery from his Iron Age I-II cemeteries in the Pusht-i Kuh are brief. The earliest material from Bard-i Bal is said to be buff, and except for a single illustrated example, unpainted. Decoration where it occurs consists of incisions, grooves and applied buttons. From the photographs it looks hand-made, extremely coarse, and it appears that some of the wares at least are straw tempered." The pottery from Pa-yi Kal appears to be similar (Iranica X, p. 59) with two vases decorated in orange sepia in patterns which bear no resemblance to those found further east (ibid., p. I XXVII). Similar pottery again comes from Sar Tang (ibid., p. 73), and Shurabah (ibid., pp. 40-3), but some of the latter is wheel-made. All these sites, according to the excavator, were originally occupied in Iron I and the pottery con- tinues into Iron II virtually unchanged with the addition of a few new forms. However, with the Iron III horizon, as discovered at War Kabud and the latest tombs of Bard-i Bal, a new type of fabric occurs, finer, grey-black, or rarely buff, made on the wheel and apparently burnished.12 It is clear from these descriptions that this pottery is quite dissimilar to the fine Baba Jan III bur- nished wares, but it does share certain shapes in common with them. These include the small jars with pierced shoulder lugs (L. Vanden Berghe, Iranica X, Fig. 21: 22-6); deep pots with open spouts (ibid., no. 36); jars with single vertical handles (ibid., no. 29); cups (ibid., no. 14) and pedestal bowls (ibid., no. 39). However, the first three types have such a wide distribution in the Zagros Iron I and II cultures generally that they need imply no more than contemporaneity, while the fourth, though found at Sialk and Hasanlu, is represented by a single doubtful sherd at Baba Jan.13 On the other hand a type absolutely typical of Iron I and II cultures elsewhere, the beak-spouted teapot, does not occur in the Pusht-i Kuh, nor do horizontal-handled bowls, animal headed-lugs, spouted bowls and other such typical Iron II forms. The Pusht-i Kuh answer to the Baba Jan teapots would appear to be the jars with a short trough spout, side and basket handles from Kalwali and War Kabud (Vanden Berghe, Opgravingen, p. I 8a and p. I 22b). They also occur without the basket handle (ibid., p. 105, Fig. 19: 5). The sites are both dated firmly to the seventh century B.C., so the pot form is probably derived from the Baba Jan III cultures, and indeed an almost identical vessel, with trough spout and basket handle in Baba Jan III fabric with typical painted decoration, is contained in the Luristan collections of the Iran Bastan museum.14 The little tubular spouted teapots from the same sites may also show Pusht-i Kuh influence (Vanden Berghe, Opgravingen, p. I 18 Fig. 3o: I). How- ever, as far as pottery is concerned, the Pusht-i Kuh would seem to be a different cultural province. 1' Goff Meade, Iran VI, p. 124 f. x1 L.

However, M. Van Loon15 reports that in the temple excavated by the late Erich Schmidt at Surkh Dom, a temple dated on cylinder seal evidence from 900/850 B.c. to 600 B.c., pottery that could be similar to Baba Jan III ware occurred below the temple floors. It is described as having dotted circles and triangles found also at Sialk B, but " links with Persian Village I are suggested by the occurrence of flat rims and beaked rims ". Since it now emerges that such forms from the " Persian Village " are no earlier in date than the fifth century B.C.,16 one can assume, I think, that the influence must come from Baba Jan III (and probably II and I also) in the next set of valleys, rather than from the more distant Sialk. It is noteworthy that " painted ware in the Giyan III tradition is present as a minor component throughout ", suggesting an overlap between Bronze and Iron Age cultures deduced from surface surveys in the northern Sardsir but not apparent at Baba Jan itself. This might explain how " Bronze Age " motifs, notably the " kite " and the " Kassite cross " came to adorn Iron Age II pottery. The closest affinities of the Baba Jan III wares still lie in the Iron II cultures of Western Iran. This is not to suggest that Baba Jan III is an exact contemporary of the Grey Ware Iron II cultures of the north. As we shall see below it undoubtedly starts later than Hasanlu IV/Dinkha II; reaches its zenith in the eighth century when the Urmia culture has been destroyed; tails off in the seventh century by which time it has affinities with Iron III. But the origins of the culture lie squarely in Iron II, and possibly in that group of Iron II cultures that are found in and around the Qazvin and Tehran oases, rather than the Dinkha-Hasanlu complex further west. The key may lie in the tombs of Khorvin, excavated by L. Vanden Berghe.17 As previously argued they would seem to be Iron II.18 They lack the button based goblets, so typical of Iron I, and found elsewhere in the cemetery, as is indicated by examples in private collections, which are published in the second half of Vanden Berghe's report. As they do not contain much metal and in particular no iron, they would appear to be early Iron II. Although the grey and red wares of the tombs are quite unlike our polished buff wares, just about every pot shape has its Baba Jan parallel; globular jar, Grave I: 3; globular jar with lugs, Grave 2: 4; jar with single vertical handle, Grave I: 5; Grave 5: 3; Grave 6: 2, 3 etc.; sinuous sided cup, Grave I: 4; Grave 2: 2; flowerpot with horizontal handle and animal headed lug, Grave 6: I; shallower bowls and flowerpots, also with horizontal handles, Grave 1: 2; Grave 2: I; Grave 4: I etc.; teapots with tubular spout and basket handles, Grave 8: 8. The typical Baba Jan beak-spouted teapot does not occur, but this is obviously a development from the Khorvin detached spouted form (see particularly Grave 12: 3). The only other two Khorvin forms which do not have exact Baba Jan parallels are the straight-necked cups (e.g. Grave I I : 5) and the trough-spouted jars (Grave 2: 3), which imitate metal prototypes more closely than their Baba Jan equivalents. The more elaborate Khorvin pots, which do not occur in the excavated tombs but are found in private collections, are not found at Baba Jan either. On the other hand, they are closely paralleled by both painted and grey wares at Sialk Necropole B, suggesting a close relationship between the two sites, amounting to a migration or well-worn trade route down from the environs of Tehran to the Kashan oasis.'9 The Baba Jan III people may have originally come from much the same area west of Tehran as well, but once in Luristan their culture developed differently. Features like bibulous toby-jugs and deep bowls with paired handles suggest influences from Marlik and Hasanlu,20 and it will probably be x5 M.

The culture of Giyan IF, in the next set of valleys east from Delfan, shows a similar mixture of Khorvin and Hasanlu features. It also produced beak-spouted pots of Khorvin type (T. 52: 2),21 horizontal-handled bowls (T. 2: 3; T. 4: 3) and vertical-handled jars (T. I: 2; T. 2: I; T. 3: 2 etc.), but its rather angular jars with a clearly defined central carination (T. I: I; T. 6: I; T. 52: I) appear to have more in common with Hasanlu forms already quoted than with the bulk of the pottery from Khorvin or Baba Jan. The relationship between Baba Jan III and Sialk B is a complex one for, although both cultures exhibit varieties of the same pottery forms or designs (e.g. beak-spouted teapots, tubular-spouted teapots, cups, lugged globular jars and trough-spouted jugs), exact parallels are difficult to pin-point. The best are still probably the sudden appearance of red-on-buff pottery at both sites; the single- handled jars with hatched pendent triangles round the neck; the use of dots and blobs as border decorations, and the rectangular designs recalling the Baba Jan tiles on the sides of the Sialk teapots. These similarities can probably be attributed to a related origin for the two cultures; direct contact between the two sites, and a common stylistic repertoire known to all the early Iranian migrants, and practised on perishable objects, such as rugs and embroidery, before being transferred onto domestic pottery. Imported Wares Imported wares probably first make their appearance in Level II, although a few sherds were also found on the III floors of the Fort. The ware has already been described fairly comprehensively in Goff, Iran VIII, p. 152 f., and Fig. 7. The bulk of the ware is wheel-made, hard, well-levigated and normally has numerous tiny grit and gold and silver mica inclusions, which glitter when the sherd is held up to the light. Some pieces have silver mica alone or none at all. This mica tempering also occurs in a proportion of the pottery of Phase I, but never in Phase III. The colour varies from off- white to greenish-cream on a few examples, through peach-pink to a reddish or greyish-brown. Many of our best examples were badly burnt in the Level IIB conflagration. On many sherds the core is fired much darker than the exterior, which appears as buff or pale cream, giving a " false slipped " effect, and often the upper part of the pot is paler than its lower portion, perhaps because of the way it was stacked in the kiln. The surface can feel like the finest grain of sandpaper, but is usually carefully smoothed or burnished. Some of the heavier vessels, particularly from IIA e.g. Fig. 12: I, have a grey core and reddish-brown surface, and the same Level also produces a coarse red ware bowl with a red slip (Fig. 12: 9). A second slipped fragment occurred in M. stratum 6, IIA or B (Fig. 9: 15), and a third is illustrated in Fig. II: 26. This type of ware may continue into IB (below p. 161). This ware seems remarkably similar to that from Nush-i Jan, Period I, and there are equally close parallels in the shapes of the pots. The most commonly occurring form is the deep bowl with thickened, knobbed or inturned rim, frequently finished with a horizontal handle and two or three small bosses (Fig. I : 8, 12 (P1. Ia), 14, 17-19; Fig. 12: 7-8; Fig. 9: 6; Fig. 10: 3, 6, 18 (P1. IIIc), see also, Goff, Iran VIII, Fig. 7: 5 and 6. Nos. 2, 3 and 4 on the same figure show unusual grooved and flattened forms). This type of bowl would seem to be exactly paralleled in the small bowls of Nush-i Jan.22 Less common, but still occurring fairly frequently are small double handled jars (Fig. I I, 20 and possibly 21 I; possibly Fig. 9: 13; and Goff, Iran VIII, Fig. 7: 8). For Nush-iJan parallels see Stronach, Iran VIII, Fig. 6: 7-9). An unusual feature of the Baba Jan jars is that in two cases the handle seems to have been deliberately twisted out of its true alignment (Fig. 9: 13 and Fig. I I: 2o). A third, characteristic shape is the jar with vertical handle and tubular spout ending in a slight trefoil. Goff, Iran VIII, Fig. 7: I shows the only complete example discovered, but Fig. Io: 7 and Fig. 12: I were probably originally similar. Also present are a variety of jars, either with or without vertical handles (Fig. 9, I4, I5; Fig. Io: 8 (P1. IIIb). Fig. 12: 3 may be a cup, but the number of handles is uncertain. It is 21 References to G. Contenau and R. Ghirshman, Fouilles de Tepe Giyan pros de Ne'havand (1935), Tomb groups.

There also appear to have been a series of heavy knob-rimmed bowls, only represented by a few rim fragments (Fig. I I: 8-I2), and large hole-mouthed storage vessels, (Fig. I I: 2-6), though some of the latter may represent intrusive material from Level I, where the type is common. Relationship of Imported Wares to Baba Jan III Wares Although careful sherd counts were kept from most levels it is very difficult to ascertain the exact proportion of Imported Wares to Level III Wares. This is because most of the pottery from Level II comes in the form of extremely scrappy sherd collections, with masses of the coarser forms of Common Ware, mixed up with a few of the finer wheel-made wares, and one cannot put too much reliance on data of this sort. However, in the two sealed deposits of" the Groom's Kitchen " and " the Carpenter's Shop ", Imported Wares are definitely in a minority. In " the Carpenter's Shop " there is only one knobbed rim bowl (Fig. IO: I8) in an otherwise pure Baba Jan III collection. In the Groom's Kitchen cache, four out of ten of the complete pots discovered were imported (Fig. Io: 3, 6, 7, 8, P1. IIIb). In Room 20 several beautiful Imported Ware vessels (Goff, Iran VIII, Fig. 71: 7, 8 and Iran XVI, Fig. 9: I4, I5) were found either in the same level as the kiln containing the two painted vessels (Fig. 9: 18 or I9), or in the stratum just above it (the stratigraphy was ambiguous). Another Imported Ware cache occurred in T stratum 4, probably IIB with a Level I admixture (Fig. 11 I: 12, P1. Ia). If different families were squatting in different sections of the burnt-out Fort and Painted Chamber, the amount of imported ware used could have depended on individual preferences and financial resources. Relationship of Level II to Level I On the face of it there was a definite break and change in culture between Levels II and I. The hand-made Baba Jan III wares stop abruptly, and the bulk of the Level I pottery is easy to distinguish from what has gone before, both in fabric and shape. The situation is complicated by two factors. In most trenches the level immediately below the Level I foundations and above the tops of the IIa or IIb walls23 is taken up by a thick layer of decayed mud brick, labelled " spotted dog " in section, otherwise, stratum 4. This level produces a striking mixture of sherds, classic Baba Jan III painted wares, imported wares and classic Level I bowl rims (see Fig. 9: 1-7, 9-Io for a representative selec- tion). The most straightforward explanation is that the site was abandoned for a few years and the tops of the Fortress walls were allowed to erode into an amorphous mass into which the foundation trenches for Level I were eventually cut. The sherd mix would thus stem from an artificial mingling of two cultures. There are, on the other hand, a few signs of genuine transition, particularly in Trench R at the top of the mound, where there appears to have been an earlier phase of Level I (Ib), associated with a definite building phase and two graves well below the Level I occupation level. Some of the pottery from the graves and building level is not typical of Level I as a whole and appears to hark back to Level II. Most of these will be published in the forthcoming report on Level I.24 There are also a few cases of sherds, which would look much more at home in a Level I context, turning up in Level II. The most striking of these is a bowl with out-turned rim firmly stratified in the oven of the White Room, stratum 5 (Fig. I i: I3). The others come from so high up the II sequence or are so rare there that it is difficult to ascertain if they are genuine Level II products or the result of pitting. These include a " grater " (Fig. I I: I) and certain types of moulded bowl and jar rims. Two jar rims from M evince a striking uniformity of fabric, shape and external treatment but one is from stratum 2 and the other stratum 6 (Fig. 9: I2, I5). Fine red slipped wares, bird handles and small fine ware goblets, typical of our Level I and of Level II at Godin, are not found in our Level II except in the erosion level, stratum 4. (See Fig. 9: 7, 9, IO for examples from stratum 4: Goff, Iran VIII, Fig. 8: 2-5 illustrates the small goblets from 23 IIA deposits are found only on the summit of the site. 24 It includes a bowl in a thick reddish fabric like Fig. I2: I with a multiple clubbed rim like Fig. i 1: 8.</page><page sequence="10">38 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Level I.)25 All but No. 4 were definitely stratified in Level Ib, either in graves or in the earliest building level.) In conclusion, the close parallels between our Level II Imported Wares and the pottery of Nush-i Jan I, suggests that the two levels are contemporary. Since most Nush-i Jan I pottery is to be dated to the seventh century B.c., we can place the III/II division around 700 B.C. Three Dimensional Figures A detailed description of the hollow anthropomorphic vase (Fig. 13: I) and its antecedents is given in Goff, Iran VIII, pp. 122-3 and P1. III a and b. The boot statuette (Fig. 13: 2), on the other hand, is solid, and is a delightful representation of contemporary footwear, complete with laces, pointed toe and three anklets. The top is partially broken and the " boot " appears to have been constructed from a separate piece of clay wrapped around an inner core. This may indicate that it once formed part of a statue that originally stood on the podium in Room 5. Alternatively it may be complete on its own, in which case it may be related to contemporary " foot vases " in Anatolia.26 Fig. 13: 3, the snake's head in Grey Ware, may also have been part of a statue. Fig. 13: 4 and 5 are typical small " toys " found all over the Middle East in all periods. Metal The metal work from Baba Jan III and II is surprisingly meagre and not typical of the type of bronze or iron work normally associated with Luristan. It can, therefore, throw little light on the vexed chronology of the Luristan bronzes. It comes mainly from occupation deposits on the Central and East Mounds and also from an ambiguous area known as the " graveyard " in the corner of the field directly to the east of the modern cemetery. Here we found ash, clinker, burnt earth, charred bones-some of which were human-scrappy Baba Jan III Common Wares and a mass of scrap bronze: fragments of metal vessels, weapons and armour buttons. The area had been thoroughly turned over by the locals looking for graves and there were rumours that elaborate bronzes had been found there at some unspecified date in the past. If this is the case the most likely location for the pre- historic graveyard is under the modern one! An alternative explanation, suggested by Salmon (my Persepolis pick-man) is a camp site, perhaps of itinerant bronze smiths, with the scrap metal being their raw material, collected to be smelted and re-used. The only two bronzes typical of Luristan are the spirally decorated anthropomorphic tube (Fig. 14: 29) from a IIA level, and the lion-headed pin from the Central Mound which is equally well tied in with Baba Jan III. Both tyies have already been discussed in detail by P. R. S. Moorey.27 The other pins are far less distinctive. Fig. I4: 9-I2 are all from Level II and have, to my knowledge, no exact parallels except for No. Io, which is so simple that it could belong to any period from the second millennium onwards. Fig. 13: 27A may have an Iron III parallel from War Kabud.28 By Level II fibulae are becoming common. Fig. 14: 3 and 4 illustrate two simple bow and elbow fibulae, much less elaborate than their near contemporaries at Nush-i Jan and Godin Tepe.29 Their appearance in Level IIB confirms the point made by Moorey that the change from spiked pins to fibulae started in the late eighth century B.c., although fibulae only became popular in the seventh century.30 The pin or fibula illustrated in Fig. 14: 2 seems so far to be without parallel, and it is difficult to see how it was used. The only piece of bronze remotely associated with a horse outside the Central Mound grave, is the odd " horse brass " illustrated in Fig. 14: I. 25 The relationship of Godin II and Baba Jan I will be discussed in greater detail in my next article. 28 References unobtaininable in Cyprus. 27 P.

Iron objects were fairly common at Baba Jan, particularly in the burnt level IIB. A selection of the objects found there is illustrated in P1. IVa. Iron was used for weapons and a wide variety of tools. Of the weapons, the daggers were the most interesting. One example (Fig. 15: 5) was discovered firmly stratified in the Carpenter's Shop, and fragments of the second were found in a pit dug into Level I on the Central Mound (Fig. 15: I5). They were both ornamented with parallel midribs, and the IIB example was so thick that it could be dagger and scabbard fused together into a single block. The same Central Mound pit also produced an iron spear-head, and, since iron objects are otherwise virtually unknown on the Central Mound, this may be intrusive material from Level II. The arrowheads (Fig. 15: 9, 13) are of a common type found at Sialk,33 in the Pusht-i Kuh cemeteries, and the later period at Nimrud. More interesting are the wide range of domestic tools. The wood-working set-wedge, knife and chisel-all in excellent condition, were found in a group on the floor of the Carpenter's Shop (Fig. 15: 1-3). They were associated with a hoe (Fig. 15: 4), which has seventh century parallels from Nimrud."8 The type continues into the Hellenistic period. The much larger hoe or spade (Fig. 15: io) also has a long history, since it appears to be a complete example of a fragment found in the garrison quarters refuse at Persepolis.35 The sickles (Fig. 15: 17, 18), which date from III and IIC deposits, have excel- lent parallels at contemporary Sialk.36 I can find no satisfactory parallels for the straight-backed knives (Fig. 15: 6, 12 and 29) but iron tools with a bronze wrapping (Fig. 15: 11) are reported from Iron II contexts by Vanden Berghe, and possibly also found at Sialk. I can find no parallel for an extraordinary pair of egg-shaped " Handcuffs ". One conclusion can be drawn from our study of the metal work. The most striking factor is the shortage of genuine " Luristan Bronzes ". Pin-head and screw-head apart, there are no elaborate animal motifs or " ceremonial standards ". Iron dagger and arrowheads apart, there are no elaborate swords, axes or other types of weapon such as are found in great profusion by Professor Vanden Berghe in his tombs around Ilam. Now it seems reasonably certain that in the area to the north of Baba Jan- the " Sardsir " of the Kakawand, Itiwend and Aulut Qabud-there are numerous " Luristan Bronze " graveyards, producing many of the more elaborate types of bronze associated withBaba Jan III painted and plain wares.37 Further confirmation is provided by Professor Vanden Berghe's excavations in the Pusht-i Kuh, which indicate that the floruit of the bronzes spanned the Iron II period. Given the above the absence of bronzes from Baba Jan must be explained in one of two ways. I. The bronzes were associated only with certain tribal groups, and Baba Jan lay just south of the main distribution area. 2. The elaborate bronzes were made primarily for ceremonial and funerary purposes, and, had we been able to find the graveyard at Baba Jan, our repertoire of metal work would have been much greater. That neither of the two graves at Baba Jan contained bronzes would not invali- date this thesis, since from Vanden Berghe's excavations we can see that rich graves were in a minority in any cemetery. The same phenomenon has already been observed in the pottery. Certain types of jar, notably those with beak spouts and basket handles, and tortoise vases, seem to have been placed in tombs. 31 See Ghirshman, Sialk II, Necropole B, Tomb 15 for examples. 32 Moorey, ibid., p. 30 and references. 33 Ghirshman, Sialk II, P1.

In eighth century Luristan not everyone was a warrior chief. Men tilled the fields, kept animals, raised families and followed tradi- tional crafts, exactly as they do in the villages to-day. Bone Objects Bone objects are illustrated on Fig. 15: 16-28. They are undistinguished and comprise knives and saws (19, 20), needles (21), handles (22, 23) and an enormous number of pierced sheep metacarples that had presumably once been used as buttons. Conclusion The historical events lying behind the changes of cultural and occupation patterns at Baba Jan have already been discussed in previous preliminary reports. Our general conclusions still stand, but a few additional points can perhaps be made even if their tentative nature must be emphasized. The end ofBabaJan III has previously been attributed to disturbances in the Central Zagros around 700 B.C. More specifically, the burning-unless purely accidental-might be attributed to: I. An Assyrian raid. 2. A Scythian or Cimmerian raid. 3. An incursion of a more powerful Median tribe from the Malayer/Jokar area. In I and 2 the Medes would have moved in from the east to fill the power vacuum left by the Assyrians. In 3 they would have introduced the Imported Wares of Level II as the direct result of the raid. The discovery in 1965 at Najafabad of a stela of Sargon II describing his Sixth Campaign proves that the Assyrians reached the end of the Assadabad plain below the Kuh-i Alvand in 716 B.C.38 From the Khorsabad inscriptions we gather that the conquests were consolidated the following year.39 Dr. Levine argues that having reached Harhar, which he locates in the eastern Mahi-Dasht, Sargon must have marched east up the Great Khorasan road to Assadabad. If Dr. Levine's theory is correct, the area between, i.e. the Kermanshah, Sahneh and Kangavar valleys, must have been Median territory.40 However, Iron II pottery of the late eighth century B.C. has not been reported in great quantities from these valleys. There is apparently none of known Median type from the Mahi Dasht itself,41 while Kermanshah and Sahneh may need resurveying in the light of recent excavation. South-east of Kermanshah, in the Garmasiab valley is a large mound bearing Baba Jan III plain Common Wares. First millennium graveyards of doubtful cultural affinities occur further south down the same river valley in the Pairavand and Ahmadawand districts.42 Small Iron I-II sites are also found scattered over the Kangavar plain,43 and there may have been others in the Kermanshah area that have been built over. However, the major area of Iron II occupation so far discovered in this region is the Sardsir of Luristan, and possibly the Nehavand valley (Tepe Giyan, Level I1). In fact north-east Luristan is the only area that appears to have been more densely populated in the Iron II epoch than either before or afterwards. It thus seems reasonable that some of the principalities mentioned by Sargon lie in the Sardsir and that the Baba Jan III culture should be equated with that of the Medes. Esarhaddon records that he campaigned against the Medes as far as the Salt Desert in about 676 B.c., and several of the tribes mentioned on the Sargon inscription also occur in Esarhaddon's records. For instance Hatarna of Sikrisi is one of the signatories of the Vassal Treaties, and Sikris is 38 Louis D. Levine, Two Neo-Assyrian Stelaefrom Iran (R.O.M.

It was obviously a Median town of some importance and in fact was first raided by Shamsi-Adad V in 823 B.c.44 Esarhad- don was also opposed by Eparna and the people of Saparda, which presumably equates with the Shaparda of the Sargon stela.45 One can therefore assume that in 676 B.C. Esarhaddon overran some of the same Median territory as Sargon. What is less easy to ascertain is just how far the Assyrian armies moved south from the main Khorasan road into the mountains, but logistically it would have been quite possible for one of Sargon's or Esarhaddon's generals to have raided south and sacked Baba Jan. The buildings under the East Mound were found burnt but with no casualties, and with little on the floors except broken pottery. This would agree with Sargon's statement that his opponents left their homes when they heard of the Assyrian approach and took refuge with their belongings in the mountains.46 The alternative is that the Assyrians marched up the Khorasan road, making feints to north and south, while the inhabitants prudently fled, or made a show of bringing tribute, most of which was in the form of domestic animals, presumably for provisioning the army. No mention is made of rich bronzes or metal work. The Cimmerians and Scythians are first mentioned in the Annals in the reign of Esarhaddon.47 At this time they were probably in Kurdistan, north of the Kermanshah road, but later in the century they are said to have conquered the Medes, perhaps in the reign of Assurbanipal, soon after 668 B.C.48 This is late for the end of Baba Jan III but may account for the fire of IIB. There is, however, another alternative. Although Baba Jan is not easy to reach from the north and west, and was therefore relatively well protected from Assyrian raids, it is vulnerable from the east. The Delfan plain on which Baba Jan lies, is really a continuation of the plain of Khawa, and from Khawa a low pass leads to the Nehavand valley and Tepe Giyan; thence well marked routes lead to the wide fertile plains of Media, around Malayer and Jokar. Now the records of Esarhaddon suggest that, at the beginning of the seventh century B.C., the Medes were not only incapable of presenting a united front against Assyria but were actually fighting among themselves: three Median chieftains appealed to Esarhaddon for help against rebellious vassels and were reinstated.49 By the end of Esarhaddon's reign, however, the Medes were attempting to unite, probably inspired, as Dr. Levine suggests, by pressure both from Assyria and from the incoming Scythians and Cimmerians.50 The leader of this movement was Kashtaritu, rather doubtfully equated with Phraortes.51 The sack of Baba Jan III and the sudden appearance of a different variety of Median pottery from the Malayer/Jokar region may, therefore, represent the initial stages of Median unifica- tion. On this interpretation, the burning of Baba Jan IIB and the slight hiatus that may occur between IIA and I could be attributed to events occurring in the " Scythian interregnum ". Finally we have to suggest a date for the beginning of the Baba Jan III culture. The Medes are first mentioned in the Annals in the reign of Shalmaneser III (854-24),52 and, as we have seen, Sikrisi is mentioned by his successor Shamsi-Adad V. Dr. Levine considers that in the ninth century the Medes occupied much the same area as their eighth and seventh century descendants, i.e. the Kermanshah- Assadabad valley systems. It is not clear whether this mid-ninth century date marks the first occasion the Assyrians penetrated thus far into the Zagros, or the arrival of the Medes there themselves, but the first interpretation seems more probable. The Baba Jan III culture may, therefore, have begun by 900 B.c. and may overlap with the Iron II cultures further north. On this timescale, the Central Mound, Levels 3-1 would fall mainly into the ninth century; the Fort and Painted Chamber would be 44 D. J.

According to Wiseman, Iraq XX, p. 13, the events described must have taken place in 674 or 670, however it is not necessary to assume that Kashtaritu himself sacked Baba Jan. There were presumably other Median chiefs engaged on similar courses of self-aggrandizement slightly earlier in the seventh century B.C. 5, For references see Levine, Iran XII, p. I 17 f.</page><page sequence="14">42 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES eighth century and have been destroyed either in the reign of Sargon II or Esarhaddon; Level II on the East Mound would be seventh century, ending sometime before the beginning of the sixth century. To sum up then: the culture of Baba Jan III is most probably Median. It derives from the Grey Ware Iron II cultures of the Elburz mountains and represents an Iranian penetration into the Central Zagros at the beginning of the ninth century. It was at its most prosperous in the late ninth and most of the eighth centuries while Urartu was engaging the Assyrians to the north. Its decline started with the resumption of Assyrian raids into the Zagros, most probably with Sargon's ninth campaign, but conceivably later in the reign of Esarhaddon. The culture of BabaJan II is also Median, introduced by a related Median tribe from further East, nearer Hamadan and Malayer. The newcomers probably moved into the vacuum created by the Assyrians but may just possibly have sacked Baba Jan III them- selves. The later burning of Level II and the change in culture between Levels II and I could represent further stages in Median unification, a Scythian raid, or a local disaster. At this distance of time it is impossible to be more precise. Some may consider that I have read too much into the evidence already but without some attempt at historical reconstruction the point of archaeological research vanishes. How else can the past be brought alive ?</page><page sequence="15">EXCAVATIONS AT BABA JAN: POTTERY AND METAL FROM LEVELS III AND II 43 Fig. i.
