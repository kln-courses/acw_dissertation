<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.4 (1994) concludes with a discussion of Nabatean iconoclasm, rock draw- ings (petroglyphs), and the significance of the non-figurative trend in Nabatean art. The final chapter, "Nabatean Art and Other Oriental Cul- ture," is an attempt to place Nabatean art in its general cul- tural milieu and discusses the worship of betyls and stelae beyond Nabatea, the Nabateans and the Jews, and Nabatea and Arabia. Though the book is an important contribution to Nabatean studies, there are several issues of concern. Patriche focuses on the aniconic character of Nabatean art, particularly in its reli- gious and funerary aspects and on its tendency to represent gods in the form of a stele, yet he fails to isolate the Nabatean moti- vation for adopting an aniconic approach to art. While he dis- cusses this point cursorily in different places (pp. 19, 20, 39, 152, 166), the discussions are inconclusive as well as scattered. Secondly, on occasion the author raises interesting points yet fails to follow through or to draw implications from the data. For example, Patriche fails to develop his observation that Na- batean pottery found in Moabite, Edomite, and northern Sinai sites, and in the Negev, is not found in excavations of Nabatean Si'a (p. 45), and that, as opposed to Petra, where figurative art was found on architectural ornaments, none was found at Madacin Saleh, er-Ramm, or at the Nabatean sites in the Negev (pp. 151, 152). Some discussions requiring conclusions lack them (see p. 60, end of paragraph one). His writing is occasion- ally unclear (p. 61, beginning of paragraph two) and, in other instances, contradictory. On p. 64, his statement that "the orien- tation of the stelae varies from place to place, and no one orien- tation dominates" contradicts the following sentence that "... there is a definite system of orientation that has proven to be valid for more than 95 percent of the stelae . . ." Moreover, he should have exercised more restraint. Rather than categorically stating that the Nabateans abstained from using images (p. 19 and elsewhere), he should have said that they had a bias toward non-figurative art, but that exceptions exist, such as stone anthropomorphic statuary on the temple to the Nabatean god Dusares, on the main temple at Petra, and the temple to the goddess al-Uzza (pp. 142, 143). Since he makes categorical claims for an aniconic Nabatean art, one wonders about the numerous exceptions. Indeed, in his zeal to defend the notion that the art is aniconic, he argues in a circu- lar fashion: since the numerous anthropomorphic and horse terra-cotta figurines are iconic, they cannot represent gods. However, organization is the most serious flaw of the book. Since chapter two is devoted to representation of the gods and chapter three to other media wherein the gods are not repre- sented, why put the discussion of Nabatean iconoclasm in the second chapter (pp. 153-57)? Likewise, if, as he argues, the human and animal terra-cotta figurines do not represent gods, why discuss them in chapter two? Though there is a certain logic in his apparent haphazard juxtaposition of topics, that juxtaposition is jarring. For example, in his section on "Clas- sification of the Figurative Representations in Nabatean Art" (pp. 48-49), he devotes almost half the space to a discussion of non-figurative art. Furthermore, Patriche's text and arguments could have been improved by gathering all relevant discussion about specific is- sues, such as his central thesis, in one section, perhaps even a chapter where he could have summarized the main points of his thesis, the aniconic character of Nabatean art, adduced the rele- vant evidence, and successfully responded to problems such as the numerous exceptions to the aniconic tendency. Because of inadequate attention to organization many of the author's excel- lent points are lost. His judgments differ at various points. In one of his discussions of the coins, he correctly notes that while the city gods are anthropomorphic, a stele is used to depict the Nabatean god Dusares (p. 70); though figurative art is found in some temples, the actual objects of veneration are non- figurative (p. 173); and though figurative rock drawings depict humans and human animals, these are not deities (p. 160). Moreover, he argues that the vast majority of examples of figu- rative art at Petra and elsewhere in Nabatea can be described as actually of Hellenistic-Roman impact and imitation. In a more technical vein, the illustrations are occasionally poor, and do not clearly support the point made in the text (e.g., p. 58 and ills. 10, 11). Finally, a reference map locating the sites discussed in the text would have been helpful. Nevertheless, the individual discussions demonstrate a com- mand of the vast literature and monuments, and Patriche's posi- tions are generally well argued and well documented. The book is therefore a very important contribution to a much-neglected area and period in the art and archaeology of Palestine and Jor- dan. It shows how art can contribute to a richer understanding of the cultural values of a society. It also prods the reader to pay attention to easily overlooked details. Finally, it serves as a model for caution in approaching the study of art from a re- gional perspective. HAROLD LIEBOWITZ UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS Catalogue of the Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum, vol. VIII: Tablets from Sippar 3. By ERLE LEICHTY, J. J. FINKEL- STEIN, and C. B. F. WALKER. London: BRITISH MUSEUM PUBLI- CATIONS, 1988. Pp. xxxvii + 442. ?50. The volume under review is the third and final catalogue of cuneiform tablets excavated by Hormuzd Rassam at Sippar from 1882 to 1895 or acquired by E. A. W. Budge during the same period. One group of texts comes from Tell ed-Der lo- cated near Sippar. The principles of description used in the Cat- 666</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books alogue have been discussed in my review of the first volume of the series published in this journal (JAOS 108 [1988]: 165-66; see also JAOS 109 [1989]: 289). The book contains an introduc- tion by Walker on the provenance of the various groups of texts and over 12,000 entries which mainly describe Old Babylonian and Neo-Babylonian tablets. The catalogue of the Old Babylo- nian texts had been prepared by the late J. J. Finkelstein and then revised and completed by Walker. The remaining parts of the book are the work of Leichty. The majority of tablets are economic and administrative documents from the archives of the Ebabbar temple at Sippar. A few texts come from Babylon, Borsippa, Dilbat, Kish, and Uruk. The collections also contain many astronomical texts, which, in Walker's opinion, probably come from Babylon (p. xiii). According to my calculations, the total number of Babylo- nian economic and administrative documents from the first millennium B.C. described in the book is 7,170. Of these, 3,716 are not dated or their dates are lost. By now 1,305 docu- ments annotated in the volume have been published. A total of 3,454 texts are precisely dated to the following kings: Shamash-shum-ukin Kandalanu Nabopolassar Nebuchadnezzar II Evil-Merodach Neriglissar Labashi-Marduk Nabonidus Cyrus Cambyses Bardiya Darius Xerxes Artaxerxes Hellenistic and Seleucid rulers 19 12 58 455 35 92 5 1160 306 395 11 815 25 47 (cf. below) 19 The following remarks present a few suggestions regarding particular texts. No. 76893 (p. 74), dated in the 26th regnal year of Nabu- [...], can safely be assigned to Nebuchadnezzar II. No. 75322 (p. 31), from the 20th day of the month Abu of Evil- Merodach's accession year, is so far the earliest known docu- ment dated in his reign. It was drafted seven weeks earlier than the document which until now has been considered the earliest evidence for his rule (see R. A. Parker and W. H. Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology: 626 B.C.-A.D. 75 [Providence, R.I.: Brown Univ. Press, 1956], 12). No. 75489 (p. 35) was composed on Ayaru 1 of Neriglissar's accession year. This is three months and three weeks before the tablet which until now was known as the earliest evidence for his reign (Parker and Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology, 12). Two tablets, at least, should be collated. They are nos. 79385 (p. 190) and 77047 (p. 78), dated respectively to the 15th year of Cyrus and 22nd year of Camby- ses. As is known, after the conquest of Babylonia Cyrus ruled nine years and Cambyses eight years. If the date of no. 83115 (p. 330) is copied correctly, Cambyses was recognized until Abu 14 of his 8th year. This is almost four months later than Nisannu 23, the date in the tablet which so far has been consid- ered his last document. However, one of Bardiya's documents was already drafted on Nisannu 19 of the same year (Parker and Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology, 14-15). According to the Catalogue, no. 77436 (p. 102) was drafted in Abu of Bardiya's 1st year. But the date of the tablet is completely lost and Abu is mentioned in it only to indicate that the interest for a loan was paid up to the end of this month. No. 75571, assigned to Xerxes (p. 38), is in reality dated in the reign of Labashi-Marduk (see Matthew W. Stolper, "The Governor of Babylon and Across- the-River in 486 B.C.," JNES 48 [1989]: 303, n. 69). The important question still to be answered is: When did the Sippar archives come to an end? As far as I know, the lat- est Achaemenid tablet in these collections comes from the 38th year of Artaxerxes (either I or II). Walker is inclined to assume that the Sippar archives ended during the reign of Ar- taxerxes and that many Hellenistic and Seleucid tablets of the collections come from Babylon and its vicinity (p. xii). On the other hand, Joachim Oelsner, in his review of the Catalogue, vols. 6 and 7, notes that the texts drafted after the 2nd year of Xerxes do not contain any indication that they were composed in Sippar (JNES 51 [1992]: 145). He thus supposes that the latest tablets of the Sippar archives belong to Xerxes' reign. In all three volumes of the Catalogue, 68 documents are dated in the reign of Xerxes and 129 come from Artaxerxes' time. When all these texts are published, they apparently will pre- sent enough prosopographic and other internal evidence to throw light on this problem. In conclusion, the volume completes the description of ap- proximately 37,000 cuneiform tablets from the Sippar region on which Leichty worked for some fifteen years. His work gives a comprehensive notion of the contents of Sippar collec- tions; Assyriologists interested in various groups of texts can now easily find them.
