<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cameras in the Quest for Meaning J. Y. BRYAN "ON any photo trip," a friend declared recently, "I would rather get one picture with meaning than a hundred with no meaning." Yes, and that preference is by no means as common as might be expected. Nor are its results widely understood. Americans presently own well over a hundred million cameras, many of them expensive. A very large majority, however, serve only as instru- ments of vanity or of family biography without probing the crust of appearance in search of meaning behind it. A substantial yet far smaller percentage serve as workaday tools. Producing photos known as docu- mentaries, they accumulate evidence regarding an enormous spectrum of events. In so doing they hugely enlarge our visual experience; but as their role is first of all just to show how things or people look when photographed, the results tend (with some notable exceptions) to make a prosaic visual statement. Less than half of one percent of our cameras are regularly used in the quest for some meaning which, being elusively suggested or implied by the appearance of things, is in general overlooked. With these the intent is to stimulate our sense of what can be inferred from what is shown, to evoke inferences deducible from exploring the subject in a uniquely probing manner. Compelling our cameras to perform such service requires very much more patient and reflective application than does briskly recording visible fractions of the temporal flux. Besides, the pondering approach runs contrary to popular notions that faster is better, and automatic best. During the ninety-two years since George Eastman patented roll film and a camera to use it, hosts of clever people have been busy at making the entire photographic process mechanical, fast, and predictable. All major camera manufacturers have joined in the endeavor to reduce most picture-taking to little more than an automatic cock-aim-shoot sequence. 40 winter 1980</page><page sequence="2">The payoff has been a dizzying rise in the popularity of photography, accompanied by tumorous growth in the proportion of routine, vapid, or simply punk pictures. For the automatic features are designed to produce a standardized result Even when in no degree faulty (which is a much rarer condition than most camera buffs know), they tend to be automatically wrong for the photographer seeking to give each picture a unique expressiveness. When something nonstandard is desired of quality cameras it is possible, fortunately, to disengage automatic features affecting exposure. We can, whenever we choose, put our trust in an intense collaboration of brain, heart, and experience rather than in the "magic" of photo- electric cells. But this is practiced very much less than it ought to be. In the meantime automation has encouraged development of a photomat mentality which regards photographs as nice, cheap, quicky stuff not worth more than a glance or two unless its subject is familiar. And whether published, exhibited, or shown by hand, a glance or two is about all our vast output of swiftly produced photos ever gets. Unhappily our superabundance of pictorial trash, by desensitizing us to visual nuance, discourages growth of ability to read more than a frac- tion of what a richly expressive photo has to say. A species of visual semiliteracy results. Confronted with the intricacies of this form of com- munication, the photomat mentality can apply little more than a Dick- and-Jane fraction of photography's large visual vocabulary. We photographers ourselves share in the blame. Too many of us, while acquiring competence at expressing ourselves photographically, have neglected companion competence at expressing ourselves verbally. We attain proficiency in visual communication without educating our- selves to explain in words what we are trying to communicate. Such failure receives encouragement from a quotation repeated weari- somely often in many lands: "One picture is worth a thousand words." Don't we have to ask which picture and what words? It is not at all im- possible to find quite small groups of words (e.g., "Love thy neighbor as thyself" or "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty" or "Government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth") which possess more import than a thousand standard products of our fast-process darkrooms. It is common enough, however, to find among serious photographers a distrust of words not current in the jargon of our craft, a hostility SOUTHWEST Review 41</page><page sequence="3">to analysis or explanation. One of the tiredest of their cliches says, "Good pictures don't need explaining. They don't even need a title or caption. The picture should speak for itself." Maybe. But why rule out the possibility that reflectively chosen words may speak well for them also? We should not be leaving elucida- tion about the import of our craft to learnedly verbose writers like Susan Sontag who, unchallenged, manage in countless ways to be so brilliantly wrong. Even though not adroit as writers, we can properly try our best, hopeful that the clues we thus drop will bring others along the right track. The fact, for example, that Edward Weston during his most crea- tive period made frequent attempts through his Day Books to explain his undertakings in photography has given depth to critical appraisal of his contribution and still enriches our perception of what his photos convey. Of course, as is true in all the arts, we are entitled to express our- selves, at least in part, through ambiguities which elude full explanation. Our intention (without at all prohibiting us from talking about it) may be just as illusive, undefined, and ambiguous as in a poem, and the result all the better for that. But how do we cope with the pervasive supposition that photos should be judged by their "impact," their quick effect? How do we in- duce viewers to contemplate them long enough to discover more than their surface assertions, more than can be grasped in a glance? How do we encourage an imaginative reading of a picture? One inducement readily applied to some photos is a well-devised title or caption or accompanying text which indicates that more than a sur- face communication is intended. Only harm can result, of course, if we adopt anything like the dreadfully trite captions appearing over and over in camera club displays - "Sentinel," or "Old Timer," or "My Kitty," etc. Even at best a thoughtful caption will help only those viewers who have an ear for words as well as an eye for pictures. But it will, among those so endowed, generate another dimension of interest, and that is all gain. Giving the title "Eloquent Rock" to the accompanying photograph of a monstrous boulder in California's Joshua Tree National Monument, for example, is intended to generate reflection about it in some depth. An advanced class of camera enthusiasts, when shown this picture, first took lively notice of its Rorschachy anthropomorphism. Some saw in it 42 winter 1980</page><page sequence="4">the face of a giant in agony; some two faces - a Jack Sprat and fat wife cheek to cheek, or a highbrow and a lowbrow arguing eyeball to eyeball, and so forth. Fine. Free play of imagination is just what such works need. But we don't want it to stop with surface impressions. The title asks the viewer to go farther and credit the picture with speaking of some resonant implication (as does the anthropomorphism itself) - something in the rock related to ourselves, something to be eloquent about. For how is such a boulder formed? By fiery, enormously powerful stresses and strains as old as time within the earth. The grimace on this boulder beseeches recognition that we at hard moments are at one with it. The difference is that the stresses and strains within ourselves are, by comparison, as a groan of disappointment to the thunders of an erupting volcano. We do often find, however, that even a title worded with care may do a photo a disservice by highlighting only a minor fraction of its intent, thus hampering exploration of what else it is prepared to convey. Our next photo, taken on the desert between Tucson and Gila Bend, Arizona, also makes use of anthropomorphism. Titling it "Man and Wife" or (say) "Brave and Squaw" would point up this feature. But surely no such pointing up is needed, and doing so would call excessive attention to just one element of its meaning. It would also too breezily ignore the role played in American history by that stretch of desert. We have here, after all, not just a photograph of quasi-embracing saguaros. Composing the whole so that the sharpest ridge of the west- ward mountains is aligned in relation to that thorny pair serves notice that we are scrutinizing more than saguaros. During the last century, the few square miles of desert around them lay directly athwart the dusty trail which formed our great westward migration's southern route from Texas to California. It ranked as one of the longest, driest, deadliest spans of that trail - ninety-one miles from water to water. After being for many decades approached with dread, crossed in the most desperate dis- tress, and survived with hatred, it has become so transfigured in reputa- tion by fast transportation and captive water that we can now at leisure study it, admire it, even love it. We can also discover in it something akin to ourselves, something almost human. We are able to see graces suggested by accord between the saguaros, the mountains, and the pat- tern of clouds overhead - graces which could not be expected to charm southwest Review 43</page><page sequence="5">our thirsty, panting predecessors. For such a photo, a caption that merely identifies should do. On the other hand, the facing picture, taken on the same desert (taken indeed during a long, long wait for the clouds west of those saguaros to assume a degree of concord with the embracing arms and the hills be- hind them), is a photographic reminder that the merciless character of the area endures. The laws of thirst, thorn, fang, and claw have not been nullified or repealed there - not for the creatures at home in that terrain. Therefore the key figure in this photo is zoomorphic and dead. Therefore, too, the title is "Talon." A very different type of photo, exemplified in "Gila Cliff Dwelling," may best be given only a location title. To reveal its intentions, overt and implicit alike, this photograph depends altogether on mood and pre- cise composition, on tonal range, on the interplay of its lines and forms, on the placement of its lights and darks. Visitors to those ruins in New Mexico are much inclined to romanticize the life vanished from them. It takes little close study, however, to comprehend that the people who sought refuge there were fearful, ill-nourished, and stunted. Small as their rooms were, each must have become crampingly overcrowded and teeming with vermin. Any contagion could sweep through such a com- munity like windblown fire through grass. At best the lot of those who dwelt there must have been quite unenviable, and in the end darkly tragic. One is reminded of Thomas Hobbes's assertion that in a state of nature the life of man is "poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Photos like "Shell on Rippled Limestone," however, may profit from having a verbal accompaniment with considerably more reach than the title alone can supply. The object which this one exploits (but is not about) is a spiral seashell wired above limestone rippled by tidal waters. When photographed, it was in the home of an anthropologist, perched on a record player in front of a crowded bookcase. As every sort of de- tail around it would detract from its suggestive power, it had to be photo- graphically isolated. This was done without moving it by reflecting light off an open newspaper onto it alone. But the result in this case did need more than an identifying title to urge a pondering consideration. For of course the seashell and limestone figure simply as agents of a complex and ranging intention. Therefore, prints of the photo went forth to friends accompanied by these lines: 44 winter 1980</page><page sequence="6">The diction of far seas persists in shells relinquished; of soughing waves and tides, in rippled limestone; of dimmest galaxies in quasar signals; of treasured years long gone, in steadfast friendships; of distant friends themselves, in lines inscribed to friends. The extent to which words in this instance did adumbrate the mean- ing was indicated by the responses. One from a famous, but now de- ceased, friend in England began as follows: My dear Bryan: I was delighted to have your card from Chihuahua, with the photo and poem, which match each other beautifully - lovely small things that contain the whole cosmos, and the cosmos itself in tune with human life. . . . Yours ever, Arnold Toynbee In those objects or scenes which most strongly impel us to turn our cameras upon them, selection of a part to represent the whole is usually imperative, often a severe selection. What we come away with is, at most, just a suggestion of what was there. For the imaginative, a sugges- tion may suffice - and yet be the richer if accompanied by suggestive phrases. "Painted Desert at Sundown" was taken as the last few minutes of an autumn day's light slanted across the Painted Desert in Arizona. A severe storm was brewing eastward, and the park had been emptied of people. We are likely to think of an impending storm as ominous and of the decline of a day or year or life as melancholy. Still, there had been no time on that particular day when any portion of the area so released the sense of wonder. The attempt to picture that peculiarity about it evoked the verses: Let no hint of gloom or failing light or distant storm suggest southwest Review 45</page><page sequence="7">That this day's, years, life's last hours must fail to be the best. Visual symbols adroitly used may perform more telling and indispen- sable service than any other one means of conveying a photograph's in- tention. So abused were trite symbols in a long-overworked style called pictorialism, however, that many seasoned photographers became sick of them and now make a show of scorning them. As if using symbols were some sort of aesthetic delinquency, they resent attempts to analyze those affecting the quality of their photos. This is sheer foolishness. In point of fact the visual vocabulary of photography, like the vocabulary of every other means of communication, consists of symbols. As words do in speech and writing, notes in music, numbers and letters in mathe- matics, and gestures in sign language, so in photography every type of line, form, position, relationship, hue, tone, sharpness, blur, and sever- ance can perform a symbolic function. Throughout all mankind's visual experience unaccountable numbers of objects have also acquired recog- nized symbolic import, and can be reendowed with it. The only ques- tion in photography is whether we are going to deal with those awaiting our use in a conscious and increasingly practiced manner, or whether we are going to let them affect our pictures sloppily and more or less in spite of ourselves. "River and the Cross" shows the crest of Mount Rubidoux in River- side, California, looking west along the Santa Ana River Valley. To say its say, it depends heavily upon symbolism on several levels. Taken in the last hour of the day, it gives dominant position to four symbols which of old acquired rich significance for people by the million in many lands - a cross, a sunset, a community of clouds, and an onward flowing river. In addition, the scene's darks and lights themselves are, in the language of photography, symbols rich in implicit meaning. How such symbols are to be interpreted, loaded as they may be with suggestive power, is determined by the context in which they are used, as is true of many words. Regarding the symbolism discoverable in a cross (a union of opposites), hundreds of pages of print have been written. Presented on a lofty peak, blackly elevated against a fading sky, it is in position to remind us of its ages-old assertions about death and resurrection. The foreground, from which all detail has been excluded to produce unrelieved and massive black, is no less ready to suggest 46 winter 1980</page><page sequence="8">the approach of night, of death, or of deep interment than the light sky is to speak of persisting life. A sunset too is a conclusion, a declara- tion of nighťs approach. But it is also a promise of another dawn to come, for sundown is no more inevitable than sunrise. Nor do the fragmented storm clouds speak any more distinctly about a storm just concluded than about fair weather impending. As for the winding river, its reminder of onward-flowing time is readable by anyone. A paradox is at play in the scene portrayed here, and also in that of the photo before it and in the one to follow. Each dwells upon condi- tions which are invariably evanescent, lasting only a few minutes before a change of light or drift of clouds or intrusion of people alters their character; yet all three speak of something ever recurrent. The mood is momentary, the subject timeless. The eighth photo in our series was taken on the rim above Crater Lake in Oregon. When confronted by such fractions of once-forested land, one does not have to be an apostle of nature-worship to experience a strong release and elevation of the spirit, followed by grieving reflec- tion about how rapidly our once spacious wilderness shrinks and falls in ruin. With the anthropomorphism of more or less blasted trees to assist the meaning, this photo is called "Kinsmen Past and Present." Visual metaphor, by enlarging the resonance of a picture, by encour- aging a play of imagination over its implications, can become a major vehicle of meaning for the photographer, just as it is for the poet. In differing ways it has a role in most of the pictures discussed thus far. Our cover photo, of course, is a metaphor, as titling it "Of Thee and Me and Thee Hereafter" serves notice. The shoots of grass in this picture, photographed at sunrise on an ex- tinct volcano (Mingus Mountain, Arizona), grow from decayed lava greatly enriched by decay of innumerable prior generations of living forms. Night still lingers in the forest around them, a surrogate of fruitful death. Aglow as they are, they illustrate how hardly, recurrent, and unified the life process is, and how dependent upon the nurturing powers of extinction, of decay, of death. There are those who dread the loss of individuality in death; yet it is probably safe to say that every form which the life process reassumes when extinguished has individuality. Certainly, under anything better than coarse or casual scrutiny, these grasses have. For just as no two sets of fingerprints are the same, it is unlikely that there is anywhere through- southwest Review 47</page><page sequence="9">out the entire world another after-print of vanished life exactly like this clump of grass. Some feeling for the emergence of unity throughout the entire life process, regardless of the form it assumes, has long been detectable in all the arts as well as in mysticism and religion - often a feeling also that the unity extends onward to outer reaches of the universe. Once we become invaded by conviction that all life is, in limitlessly differing ways, an infusion of purpose and form through primal chaos, we move easily from the idea that we are as the grass to acceptance of the longer view that we are one with it, and with a great deal else. Yes, but nothing said here about aids usable for illuminating the results of our quest for meaning with our cameras does more than touch upon the infinitude of possibilities. The most significant contribution we can make, and the greatest gain for us as photographers, occurs in the quest itself. 48 winter 1980</page><page sequence="10">Eloquent Rock</page><page sequence="11">Saguaros by Old Trail Westward</page><page sequence="12">čm*&gt; -«IK11 Talon</page><page sequence="13">Gila Cliff Dwelling</page><page sequence="14">Shell on Rippled Limestone</page><page sequence="15">s s o "8 Q S 2</page><page sequence="16">&lt;3 a ■s 1</page><page sequence="17">ì £ ì I 8 § S £</page></plain_text>
