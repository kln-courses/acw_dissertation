<plain_text><page sequence="1">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature JOHN F. CORNELL Department of History University of Georgia Athens, Georgia 30602 One of the most significant analogies in the history of science is Charles Darwin's comparison of nature with plant and animal breeding. The analogy of artificial and natural selection is the hallmark of all of Darwin's accounts of organic evolution - his last notebook on trans- mutation, his early drafts of 1842 and 1844, his epistolary summaries of his theory,' and his later published works. It is one of those flour- ishes that give his writings their enduring appeal. Darwin's use of the analogy certainly sets him apart from Alfred Russel Wallace;2 and he sought to maintain that analogy even at some cost. In the 1860s, when the use of analogy seemed to put his doctrine in jeopardy and he accepted Wallace's criticism that the analogical presentation invited misunderstanding, Darwin still felt that the "connection" between artificial and natural selection was a genuine advantage.3 Twentieth-century students have had a variety of insights into Darwin's use of the breeding analogy in his doctrine of nature. The analogy has been recognized as a rhetorically effective reflection of 1. See especially 7he Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, ed. Francis Darwin, 3 vols.

Wallace himself made a remark about Darwin's superior accomplishment that (regardless of Wallace's opinion) should perhaps also include Darwin's devel- opment of the analogy of the breeder: "I have not the love of work, experiment, and detail that was so pre-eminent in Darwin, and without which anything I could have written would never have convinced the world" (Wallace to A. Newton, 3 December 1887, cited in The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, and Selected Letters, ed. Francis Darwin (New York: Dover, 1958), p. 201. 3.

Darwin agreed to a reformation of terminology, and the title of the fourth chapter of the Origin was revised in accord with Wallace's suggestion to "Natural Selection; or the Survival of the Fittest," the latter term coming originally from Herbert Spencer.

Darwin's repeated account of his discovery6 - that the problem he endeavored to solve was how to apply principles of artificial selec- tive breeding to nature - has been rightly criticized.7 In a sort of scientific discovery myth, he may have overrated the influence of the breeder's art on his "Malthusian" hypothesis about organic change. These particular observations lend credence to the general view that Darwin's analogy of breeding and nature is without great significance in itself, but is accessory to the basic doctrine of evolution by natural selection. I submit, however, that while scholars have illuminated many connec- tions between Darwin's theoretical development and the practice of breeding, the full implications of the prominence of such a technical skill in his doctrine of nature have not yet been grasped.8 It is easy to forget that breeding is a form of technology; it seems to be simply an art, and a traditional one, unrelated to machines and modern industry. But breeding became increasingly rationalized in the England of the agricultural and industrial revolutions.9 A bold sense of the boundless possibilities of rigorous selection attended the development of breeding. 4.

We must consider what historical significance Darwin's further elevation of selection to the ruling principle of nature has; how such a teaching about nature may stem from the broad technological as- sociations of modern science; and whether Darwin's teaching reflects, more than accidentally, a technological interpretation of nature. The possible latent technological slant of Darwin's thought does not affect the validity of the theory of natural selection. But considering it does help us address the difficult questions of the limits of such a perspective on nature as a whole, and of the relative importance of selection in organic evolution - questions of concern to Darwin himself.10 We can also recognize the import of several events on the way to his composition of The Origin of Species. We see, for example, that in the process of discovery Darwin radically altered his view of the re- lation of art and nature; that this alteration necessarily obscured the possible limits to the selectionist explanation of evolution; that the myth of discovery, initiated by Darwin, may have been an unconscious attempt to support a difficult analogy; and that the analogy he finally presented to illustrate an unlimited mechanism of evolution was not strictly argued. Further, we shall see that the more Darwin's doctrine in the Origin is taken as a complete account of evolution (a claim that his style of argument may easily suggest), the more it entails a paradox in its assessment of man's place in nature, a paradox connected to technological thinking. Finally, we shall consider briefly the context of thought about science and creation in which Darwin had to work out his great vision of nature. BREEDING AND ORGANIC TRANSFORMATION The historical developments of which a wide-ranging and original scientific thinker such as Darwin is the culmination may be as numer- ous and as indeterminate as the themes in his work. But there are two specific lines of natural philosophy relevant to Darwin's creation of the breeding-nature analogy that should be noted before examining his work. The first might be considered a conservative line of thought about breeding and evolution. For breeding was not neglected by theoretical naturalists prior to Darwin, but it was seen as providing very limited help in illuminating nature's history. 10. See below, p. 329. 305</page><page sequence="4">JOHN F. CORNELL It was on the basis of horticultural experience - especially with hybrids - that Linnaeus doubted the permanence of the plant species of his day and that eighteenth-century French botanists (J. Marchant, M. Adanson, and A.-N. Duchesne, for example) discussed the natural formation of species and races."' Georges Buffon also considered domestication in exploring the idea that modern species were de- scended from earlier forms. New environments and habits, acquired under the "tyranny of man," produced constitutional reactions in beasts: the camel's knees, for example, became to-igh and knotty in its domestic service. Buffon, too, referred to hybrids in his con- sideration of the transformation of species over time.'2 Similarly, Lamarck revealed a view of domestic organisms consonant with his theory of transformism: habits acquired by domestic fowl altered the proportions of their legs and wings, and environment affected the "habits" of cultivated plants.'3 In viewing these early conceptions of organic domestication, it is important to see their relative emphasis on uniform natural factors. Natural causes, everywhere of the same kind - conditions, habits, occasional interbreeding - are responsible for the changes undergone by plants and animals. The domestic was simply that arena in which the results of these natural causes could be most easily observed. Two corollary points should be stressed. First, the extent of natural change attributable to these causes appeared to these authors to be rather limited. Linnaeus and the French botanists admitted only a degree of development from some original kinds, and Buffon had various ideas on the causes of organic form. The effects of habit on structure were only part of the story of evolution for Lamarck, who postulated an inward tendency toward complexity to explain the overall ascent of living beings. In the second place, these naturalists showed little awareness of the role of art in the transformation of domestic organisms. They did not see effects of human desire and design when they viewed the creatures living with man; not even Buffon's allusion to human tyranny is meant to place animals in the category of artistic products. In England during the early nineteenth century there was perhaps greater awareness of the possible relevance of breeding to the question 11.

Charles Lyell, in some well-known pages of the Principles of Geology, used breeding as a handy experimental ground on which to contest Lamarck's transformist teaching. To the extent that Lyell assumed the similarity of causes in the wild and under domestication (circumstances and habit seem to figure as importantly in his notion of organic mutability as in Lamarck's),'4 the effects of these causes on a given form were seen as demonstrably limited and therefore leaving transformism as mere speculation. Lyell was, moreover, aware of how the breeder actually interfered with the course of nature. He did not hint at any- thing like artificial selection, but he did emphasize how grafting, the use of manures, and the prevention of crosses - the agricultural arts, in short - contribute substantially to changes in organisms wit- nessed on the farm. But because these are modes "which nature does not employ," 'l and because they have no clear natural analogues, reasoning from the domestic to the natural about transformism would be misleading. William Whewell, too, used the evidence of breeding to argue against the idea of evolution.16 The breeders themselves, or at least those who were self-conscious about their practice of selection, saw in their manipulations a certain relevance to the natural world. One of the best-known breeders, John Sebright, linked man's activity in breeding and the power of environ- mental conditions over wild species. Michael Ruse emphasized that Darwin had the artificial-natural selection analogy thrust at him when he read Sebright's pamphlets on breeding."7 But Sebright did not himself see the natural analogue of selection as particularly powerful or crea- tive, nor did he relate it to any theoretical discussion of evolution. Hence Sebright, like the other pre-Darwinian writers, restricted the implications of the artistic domain for natural transformations. Those who are familiar with Darwin's writings will at this point recognize an important feature of his conceptual creativity. Darwin might not have been original in linking breeding and evolution, or even human selection and an analogous natural cause of change; still, it was 14.

CORNELL Darwin who forged from the union of selection and natural change an entirely original interpretation of nature, and this by expanding indefi- nitely the scope of the causality of selection in art and nature. His achievement places Darwin in the company of other major philosophers who fashioned epoch-making ideas of nature on the basis of some idea of art - Aristotle who based natural philosophy on techne, Descartes on mechanism, and Goethe on the fine arts. But it particularly associates him with the revolutionaries of early modern science who redrew the traditional boundaries of art and nature in a single feat of imagination. For what perhaps most generally characterized the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century, and such diverse writers as Bacon, Galileo, and Descartes, was the denial of a specific, teleological natural order to which man's arts and actions were supposed to conform, and the proclamation of man's full and free dominion over nature."8 Similarly, Darwin's concepts of art and nature reflect his vision of man and all other beings in a limitless historical flux. The power of artificial selection, as he treats it, is as difficult to delimit as the history of man's changing relations to different organisms is difficult to ascer- tain: the exact origins of some domestic plants and animals are as lost in the past as species without fossil representations.'9 Darwin's reinterpretation of the meaning of art and nature is very much a part of the Darwinian revolution.20 FROM CREATIONISM TO TECHNOLOGISM The association made by scientists before Darwin between the practice of breeding and the theory of species change seems to have 18. The classical notion of techne, or human art, discernible in Hippocratic medicine and developed in natural philosophy by Aristotle, is clearly related to nature and nature's internal ends. Art imitates or completes natural processes; it follows nature's lead. See, for example, Werner Jaeger, Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture (New York: Oxford University Press. 1944), 111, 3-45.

In contrast, Darwin's transcendence of that traditional idea to reinterpret the history of organisms recalls the earlier, more radical rejection of the teleological relation between art and nature by the founders of modern science. It is at this point, perhaps, where traditional arts open up to the possibility of indefinite control, that we may more properly speak of a technological approach to nature. We do well to consider whether there is a deeper ground common to Darwin's scientific use of improved agricultural breeding in the nine- teenth century and some of the technologically inspired doctrines of the seventeenth century. Francis Bacon, for example, certainly identified the new knowledge of nature, which emphasized means and "moving causes" rather than ends and formal causes, with promises of increasing power to alter living things for man's benefit;21 he felt that it then would become easy to conceive plants and animals primarily as objects of potential human control. The actual path from the new science and technology of the seventeenth century to Darwin, however, seems an indirect one, proceeding through the mechanistic view of the organism and a mechanistic doctrine of creation. This is the second line of modern natural philosophy relevant to Darwin's analogy. It may be helpful to recall here the mechanistic background of modern creationism. In the seventeenth century Descartes had pushed the mechanistic interpretation of nature almost to its limit. He re- defined not only the character of organisms, but also the relation of man to nature and even the role of the deity in creation. It is ex- tremely doubtful that he himself adhered to the crude notion of God's fashioning an animal as man does a machine; it is inconsistent with both his metaphysics and his search for a mechanistic account of cosmogony and organic origins.22 But perhaps for lack of a more powerful image, he did suggest this anthropomorphic idea of creation. "Such persons [as are acquainted with the variety of machines fabri- cated by human industry]," he says in the Discourse on Method, "'will look upon this [organic] body as a machine made by the hands of God, which is incomparably better arranged, and adequate to move- ments more admirable than is any machine of human invention."23 21.

CORNELL Indeed, modern Europeans were increasingly acquainted with the machines of human industry, and such persons did look upon organisms as machines. The view is pervasive in the early history of modern biology, expressed in some form by such figures as Hales, Boerhaave, Buffon, LaMettrie, and d'Holbach;24 and although bio- logical mechanism as a philosophical tenet was profoundly criticized by Kant,25 it was still visible in such later naturalists as Lamarck and Cuvier.26 This is undeniably a view inspired by technology, despite the fact that it seems more purely theoretical than Bacon's. It has often been suggested that the mechanist conception of nature, whether metaphysically justifiable or not, cleared the way morally for man's operation upon and experimentation with nature.27 Be this as it may, the mechanist conception achieved still wider influence through the " progressive" theology in which the image of the deity became, based on the model of man's technical activity, one of a remote artificer. The "physicotheology" of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries promoted the mechanistic idea of creation; the tradition in England, represented by William Paley, Adam Sedgwick, Charles Bell, and others, was especially popular.28 Natural theologians sometimes veiled their anthropoid machine-making deity in references to miracle and the mystery of creation,29 but their presumptuous mechanistic inter- pretations of fundamental organic processes (which we see for instance in Paley) gave them away.30 Even the study of an abstruse theological 24.

It is true that Charles Lyell endeavored to enrich the contemporary physicotheological idea of special creation by stressing the importance of geographic circumstances in a species' contingent existence and the continuity of the creative process. His obscure brand of creationism based on uniform, secondary causes in the ever-changing environments of the earth seems remote from the original mechanical version. Fur- thermore, he distinguishes the technology of the breeder from natural process and thus opposes the doctrine of evolution: he appears to separate the realm of human control from the realm of nature. In a passage in the Principles, which though curious is easily over- looked, we see that Charles Lyell's position is not so remote from the other technological stances. To explain his theory of a continuous creation of species, distributed over geographic space and geological time, Lyell says: "Let us suppose every living thing to be destroyed in the western hemisphere, both on the land and in the ocean, and permission to be given to man to people this great desert, by trans- porting into it animals and plants from the eastern hemisphere... In the first place, it would be necessary for naturalists, before they imported species into particular localities, to study attentively the climate and other physical conditions of each spot."' 3 He goes on to explain how, on this view, distinct botanical and zoological "provinces" would arise, much like those we find today. Significant in this passage is the unique and dominant role given to man in Lyell's supposition, specially formulated to illustrate a problem concerning the whole of nature. Lyell is not really far from a technological reading of creation or from Darwin's reliance on the model of breeding; the Principles has links to both. Lyell is somewhere between them on the same general continuum of thought and shows the tacit attitudinal connection between Cartesian mechanism and Darwinian selectionism: Cartesianism and Darwinism, and Lyell's own curious hypothesis illustrating geographic distribution, all formulate their idea of nature by supposing some human achievement to exem- plify adequately the whole process of natural origins. Human action is conceived as if it could grasp the natural world in its entirety, as if comparable to divine agency. This setting of living nature conceptually apart from man as an object of his manipulation is the essence of the technological approach in natural science. 3 1 . Lyell, Principles, III, 79. 311</page><page sequence="10">JOHN F. CORNELL The transition in English natural philosophy from the technological outlook of special creationism to that of artificial breeding is evident if we consider the terms in which the very question of organic develop- ment was posed. Lyell's view of the question reflects his creationist background.32 We must inquire, he tells us in the Principles, "whether species have a real and permanent existence in nature? or whether they are capable, as some naturalists pretend, of being indefinitely modified in the course of a long series of generations?"33 The approach thus begins with the accepted presupposition of some static, specific entities, and because of this presupposition the question is not whether they change naturally, but rather whether thejy can be changed. Nature as a whole is already conceived as passive under the mechanist-crea- tionist dispensation. Hence the question of natural evolution is readily conceived in terms of the probable consequences of human manipula- tion. The frequent reference in this period to the "mutability" of species - which is Darwin's usage, too34 - iinplies not only that the problem is the stability of species but also that the solution may be found through technological demonstrations. This approach Darwin carried over into natural history more completely than his predecessors, to the point of conceiving evolution, systematically, in accord with what man might "wish to alter," or how a particular change "could be effected."35 In sum, we can see that it is only a small intellectual leap from the notion of an anthropomorphic engineering deity to the idea of developmental creation based almost exclusively upon man's mastery of natural things. THE TRANSITION TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE We may now profitably consider the change in Darwin's views on nature and man's art. This is one of the implicit categories in the note- books on organic transmutation that Darwin kept between mid-1837 32.

Several authors have debated the relation of breeding and natural selection in Darwin's thinking. If we pose the question more generally - asking about the relation of art to nature - and thus not read into the note- books Darwin's later doctrine, we can derive even more insight into his intellectual development and particularly his movement toward a technological view of evolution. The perspective on nature and evolution with which Darwin opens his first notebook on transmutation might be called a naturalistic one, in which the art of breeding as art is not important. Darwin begins with roughly the outlook of his predecessors such as Buffon or Lamarck, who assumed transformation to be accomplished by causes with no special analogies to a human agency. At various times Darwin in fact adopted their idea that circumstances affected organic constitution directly, and also indirectly through the medium of habit. More important at this early stage, as David Kohn has shown, was Darwin's concern with the variation coming from sexual reproduc- tion, the "tendency to vary by generation" (B 5) as individuals from different lines of heredity and influence come together.37 Darwin's basic view of transformationi seems to have been that variation and variety making are a natural, ongoing process, leading necessarily to speciation. Kohn suggests that Darwin's preselectionist hypotheses can be reduced to the formula, "species evolved, therefore they have some internal way of evolving."38 The assumption of such a tendency does not explain how it works mechanically. But it certainly preserves the notion that organisms evolve on their own without being affected by any external agency, and that nature is prior to art and not es- sentially or potentially under human control. Darwin appears to hold that as variations arise, barriers help races to form. There are two kinds of barriers: physical and, to a lesser 36. Charles Darwin, Notebooks on Transmutation of Species, ed.

CORNELL extent, psychological. "A species as soon as once formed by separation or change in part of country. repugnance to intermarriage - settles it" (B 24). The naturalistic character of this initial idea of evolution is especially apparent if we consider the roles Darwin assigns, at this point, to man and to art. He identifies both a natural and an artificial aspect of the relations among races. (Art, we shall see, is a special, irrelevant case.) The "natural" tendency, which is the more important one for Darwin's view here, seems to be that of the separation of races, the movement in the direction of becoming species. no one can doubt that less trifling differences are blended by intermarriages. then the black and white is so far gone, that the species (for species they certainly are according to all common language) will keep to their type: in animals so far removed with instinct in lieu of reason there would probably be repugnance and art required to make marriage. - As Dr. Smith remarked man and wild animals in this respect are differently circumstanced. (B 33-34) In this passage Darwin treats man not as a technological agent, set apart from nature, but as an organism subject to the same tendencies of nature (as Darwin then conceives them) as any other being. Man is similar to animals who act naturally, "with instinct in lieu of reason," when "there would probably be repugnance." Man serves as a con- venient natural example of evolutionary diversification elsewhere in the notes: Man already has produced marked varieties and may someday produce something else. but not probable owing to mixture of races. - When all mixed physical changes (?intellectual faculty being acquired alters case) other species or angels produced. (B 21 5; see also 71) When mentioning domestic varieties of plants and animals in this first notebook, Darwin treats them more or less as he does the human races; they are a convenient example of natural diversification. Re- ference to domestic animals increases in frequency toward the end of the notebook, but it remains a privileged domain (as Camille Limoges has called it) for inquiry - a natural domain, not an artificial one. Buffaloes from Timor and English cattle show repugnance to inter- mingling (B 132); so do some breeds of dog (B 183). Domestic animals also demonstrate how geographic circumstances affect organisms in 314</page><page sequence="13">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature general under nature (B 100). Darwin even supposes environmental causes "of which we are ignorant" to be responsible for domestic canine races (B 217). Further, because he conceives domestic animals under their natural aspect, he can make a general comparison between them and wild animals undergoing change.39 "A Race of domestic animals made from influences in one country is permanent in another. - [added:] Good argument for species not being so closely adapted" (B 130). Darwin at this stage uses a comparative method with two spheres of observation, both equally natural. The observations regarding do- mestic organisms are an unproblematic form of evidence, for these are not viewed as products of a human art. Toward the end of this notebook he conceives "THE GRAND QUESTION: Are there races of [cultivated] plants run wild or nearly so, which do not intermix[?]" (B 275). Thus Darwin counters Lyell's view that domestic varieties return to their natural specific form when restored to freedom in nature. Darwin, who considers adaptation to circumstances less specific than does Lyell,40 is able to imagine that varieties remain distinct and can continue to become species. In all this, Darwin has not employed an analogy of art and nature. The art necessary in breeding appears to Darwin to be an interference, acting against the natural process of development. It has been ab- stracted, therefore, from the naturalist's problem. Darwin is not yet especially concerned with artificial selection, though he is aware, of course, of man's control over breeding in general. Thus breeding in human races and cultivated varieties of plants and animals is artful when it involves forced intermarriage, when (as Darwin notes) "art [is] required to make marriage" among domesticated beasts, or when man applies the political and social arts which Darwin's informant must have been considering in calling men and wild animals "differently circumstanced." Whereas the first notebook on transmutation stresses the common natural aspects of the domestic and the wild, the second (written between February and July of 1838) shows Darwin's increased aware- ness of the methods and accomplishments of breeders. In this period Darwin studied tracts by agricultural breeders. Expert animal breeders 39. Kohn ("Theories to Work By," p. 1 37) reters to this stage of the com- parison as a "descriptive analogy." 40. Ibid., p. 77. 315</page><page sequence="14">JOHN F. CORNELL with whom he was personally acquainted also made an impression on him. In particular, William Yarrell convinced Darwin of a distinction between "natural," vitally adapted varieties, and "monstrous" artificial ones - like the fanciers' pigeons - which were "picked" and continu- ally inbred to preserve their peculiar ornaments and which often required special care and protection.4' Picking made a variety relatively independent of external circumstances and dramatically shortened the time it would take nature to effect a significant change (C 17). Because of this independence, Darwin likened the breeder's technique of picking to his making of hybrids: it was "unnatural" (C 53, 120). Such control of domesticated animals and cultivated plants had to be ignored in order to focus on how organisms change naturally on their own; nevertheless, it could be used to examine the underlying, natural laws of inheritance. Darwin therefore continued to puzzle over the initiating circumstantial causes of organic variation, the effects that the degrees and the ancestral age of differences between mates have on reproduction and variability, and the occurrence of aversions to pairing. When Darwin read the breeding pamphlets of Sebright and Wilkin- son, which spelled out the principle of "selection" and even sug- gested an analogical cause in nature, it was still not the artistic aspects of this knowledge that concerned him. Darwin's marginalia in his copies of these pamphlets, as well as his notebook references (C 133-136), indicate that his attention was on his usual concerns - whether older varieties are less likely to breed, and psychological aversions to mating. He even objected to Sebright's omission of the latter influence,42 and his marks on the passages bearing on artificial selection are inconsistent and very general.43 We must agree with Ruse's 41. M. J. S. Hodge, "Darwin and Natural Selection: Roles for Methodological Ideals in a Theoretical Innovation," in Kohn, The Darwinian Heritage. 42. On p. 8 of Darwin's copy of J. Sebright's "Art of Improving the Breeds of Domestic Animals," Darwin noted (in pen), "does not take into account loss of desire." He made similar observations on pp. 10 and 14. Also, on the cover of the pamphlet Darwin remarked about the distinct smells of races and breeds of animals. 43. Sebright's initial definition of the "art of breeding," which he says consists in "the selection of males and females, intended to breed together" (p. 5), is not marked by Darwin; Darwin's first marginal marks refer to Sebright's discussion of the "long-in-the-blood" principle of hereditary character (p. 7), which he considered in NBT C. The concern reflected in the other marginalia seems also to be with such relatively natural principles (desire, heredity, the presence of variation). Sebright's general "theoretical" remark on p. 26, that 316</page><page sequence="15">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature ultimately qualified assessment of how impressed Darwin was at this point by the artificial mode of producing varieties.44 The most we can suppose to have happened is that, under the influence of the breeding literature, Darwin began to see that his prior conception of the separa- tion of varieties by natural geographic barriers has a technological analogue. Man's control begins to seem hypothetically relevant to the question about nature - but only as a possible, artful imitation of a natural process, not as the conceptual path to evolution that artificial selection will later become. This seems to be the sense of a marginal note, cited also by Ruse:4s5 "In plants man prevents mixture, varies conditions and destroys, the unfavourable kind. could he do the last effectively &amp; keep on same exact conditions for many generations he would make species, which would be infertile with other species."46 Although Darwin, under the impact of the breeders' essays,47 seems "the alteration which may be made in any breed of animals by selection, can hardly be conceived by those who have not paid some attention to this subject" is not marked by Darwin. Darwin's marginalia in J. Wilkinson's "Remarks on the Improvement of Cattle" (Darwin Offprint Collection, no. 62) indicate roughly the same interest. These markings focus especially on the possibility of per- petuating new characters (for example, pp. 5, 33, 34, 38). 44. Ruse, "Darwin and Artificial Selection," pp. 347-349. 45. Ibid., p. 347. 46. Sebright, "Art," p. 14 (Darwin's copy). It must be borne in mind that the dating of the marginalia is not so certain as that of the notebooks, which do not reflect this emphasis; this note may even be later than Notebook C, or be an offhand remark - a speculation that we might read in retrospect as a theoretical milestone. In any case, it is noteworthy that the analogies that con- fronted Darwin in the breeder pamphlets do not compare in scope to the one Darwin would make in NBT E. Sebright appears to make a relatively weak cause in nature correspond to "all the good effects of the most skillful selection" (p. 15). Wilkinson clearly makes the artificial production of a variety by selection an imitative and forced version of nature's process, which he characterizes as a "certain tendency to change." Man works in his own peculiar way with this "law of nature." Darwin marks the following sentence with double marginal lines and quotation marks: "The longer also these perfections have been con- tinued, the more stability will they have acquired, and the more will they partake of nature itself" (Wilkinson, "Remarks," p. 5). Wilkinson's idea of selection as an artificial version of nature's way or ways seems to express all that the analogy means to Darwin, too, at this reading. 47. In Darwin's copy of Sebright's "Observations upon the Instinct of Animals" (London, 1836; Darwin Offprint Collection, no. 64) there is on p. 6 another possible clue to such a gradual conflation of art and nature. Darwin contests the author's distinction of acquired behavior from "instinct": "This, I think, is error confining instinct to what is implanted only by nature." 317</page><page sequence="16">JOHN F. CORNELL to have considered the possible similarity as well as the difference between art and nature, neither the second nor the third notebook shows him ready to make an analogy from art to nature, or to see an artificially contrived variety as equal to any natural one. The "really natural breed," where "not one is picked out" (D 20), arises from natural causes, even though it (accidentally) lives with man; this he still contrasts to the "monstrosity propagated by art" (D 107). As it is my purpose here to discuss Darwin's development only as it bears on the important questions of analogy and technology, in what follows concerning the still more crucial period from September 1838 through the early sketches of the theory of natural selection I shall not illuminate the many details of Darwin's greatest discovery. I should like only to argue that his tacit views on art as separate from and subordinate to nature had to be reworked in order to con- vince him fully that he had found a plausible evolutionary mechanism, and that this revision opened the possibility of technological bias. The importance of Darwin's reading of Malthus for his understanding of the "struggle for existence" as a powerful force in nature has been generally recognized, even by those who have critically reexamined the conventional narrative of Darwin's discovery."8 His Malthusian insights in September and October of 1838 were neither unprecedented in his notes nor yet as fully developed as they would eventually be; but there is enthusiasm in his remarks about ill-adapted structures of organisms being "driven out in the grand crush of population" (E 9, excised). This does not mean that Darwin suddenly regarded such pressure as the most important causal agency. For Darwin, as M. J. S. Hodge has observed, the "wedging" of living masses was initially a cooperative mechanism, grafted onto his earlier ideas about prenatal adaptive variation.49 He earnestly continued his investigation of the organic causes of change: the environmental influences on the sexual elements, acquired habits, and correlation of parts (E 43, 50, 51, 54). Darwin's later and better-known generalization that chance individual variations were the basis of organic change was not an immediate deduction. Hodge maintains50 that the concept of chance variation emerged only with Darwin's discovery of the analogy of the breeder 48.

Hodge, "Darwin and Natural Selection." 5 0. Ibid. 318</page><page sequence="17">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature and the application of artificial selection to nature, a crucial point to which we shall return. For now, let me note merely that scholars generally agree that Darwin conceived a Malthusian mechanism in nature before working out any analogy involving selection.5' His investigation of the art of breeding had not led him to the analogical question, "What in nature corresponds to the breeder?" This question, supposedly answered by his reading of Malthus, was never seriously posed - Darwin's own "recollection" and the legendary account of his discovery notwithstanding. The first use of the famous analogy appears in early December of 1838: Are the feet of water-dogs at all more webbed than those of other dogs. - if nature had the picking she would make them [sic] such a variety far more easily than man, - though man's practised judg- ment even without time can do much. (E 63) According to Hodge, who has examined the role of domestic animals in Darwin's theoretical development perhaps more extensively than any other commentator, the analogy grew out of Darwin's reflections on sporting dogs (particularly the Chesapeake retriever), domestic breeds that he increasingly saw as well adapted to nature, and not simply as monstrosities."2 Hence Darwin could connect his Malthusian view of nature, and the effect of adaptation to nature, with picking. The connection of nature and picking is nonetheless imaginative: the adaptation of a water dog for man's use of it in nature does not neces- sarily make it any less an artificially picked breed; this case has simply encouraged Darwin to make a comparison between man and nature as selectors of animal form. The hypothetical character of the notebook passage - "if nature had the picking" - further underlines the in- ventiveness of the comparison. Through the notebooks Darwin has subtly changed the orientation of his thought: from a relatively naturalistic view of the process by which organisms change spontaneously from within, to which view art is unimportant; to a view of varieties separating geographically, which process merely has an artificial analogue; to his Malthusian theory of change now described in an artificial or, better, technological way. The inspiration of connecting the Malthusian notion back to the 51. See above p. 304. 52. Hodge, "Darwin and Natural Selection." 319</page><page sequence="18">JOHN F. CORNELL breeders, while certainly to some degree legitimate, opens the door to an unrestricted and imaginative application of Darwin's idea of organic change, to a technological interpretation of the history of life that makes nature both an external agent itself in the image of man and at the same time a product of external forces like the organisms under man's control. The newfound analogy appears in subsequent notebook passages. One indicates the actual order of the development of Darwin's theoriz- ing, in that breeding is said to follow the way of nature.53 It is a beautiful part of my theory, that domesticated races of organics are made by precisely the same means as species - but latter far more perfectly &amp; infintely slower. - No domesticated animal is perfectly adapted to external conditions. (F 71; see also E 75) Another passage shows Darwin excluding local varieties (influenced directly by environment) from the artistic analogy,54 and evidently recording the rhetorical strategy that would finally unfold into the long argument of the Origin: Varieties are made in two ways - local varieties when whole mass of species are subjected to same influence, &amp; this would take place from changing country: but greyhound [race-horse] &amp; pouter Pidgeon have not been thus produced, but by training, &amp; crossing &amp; keeping breed pure [&amp; so in plants efJectually the offspring are picked &amp; not allowed to cross. -J Has nature any process analogous - if so she can produce great ends - But how - even if placed on Isid if &amp;c &amp;c[- make the difficulty apparent by cross-questioning. -I Here give my theory. - excellently true theory (E 1 18, [ ] denotes insertion by Darwin) As we have seen, Darwin conceived the natural cause of Malthusian population pressure before he brought the specifically artful business, and artistic language, of picking to bear upon it. He may have moved temporally from a keener knowledge of breeding to his Malthusian idea of nature, but these elements acquired their ultimate meaning for his search in reverse order, when the breeder's work was considered 53. Kohn also noticed this ("Theories to Work By," p. 139). 54. Hodge, "Darwin and Natural Selection." 320</page><page sequence="19">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature anew to describe the Malthusian discovery.55 Note his gravitation toward a rhetorical presentation of the discovery, a strategy of rea- soning from art to nature, which he himself finds convincing and will use to convince his readers in all his later accounts of natural selection.56 This rhetorical movement from art to nature seems to have shaped Darwin's own recollection of his original problem. Later, he even represented his discovery of breeders' selection as precipitating an analogical problem that he would have to solve. In the Autobiography he wrote: "I soon perceived that selection was the keystone of man's success in making useful races of plants and animals. But how selection could be applied to organisms living in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me." 57 Yet we find in the notebook no evidence, even circumstantial, that Darwin actually was baffled by this problem of applying picking to nature.58 It seems likely that Darwin's autobiographical recollection was shaped not just by time, but by a deeper conceptual necessity, one that also underlies his earlier accounts of his discovery. Elsewhere he does not state the analogical problem so boldly - this in itself casts doubt on the perfect accuracy of his recollection - but we do get the impression that Darwin worked by analogy from artificial to natural selection. The analogical path is implied by the introduction to the Origin: It is .. . of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and co-adaptation. At the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed. 9 The analogical path of discovery is suggested, too, in his Variation of Plants and Animals under Domestication: 55. Ruse, "Darwin and Artificial Selection," p. 350, also deduced this sequence of Darwin's discovery. I suggest below that it liberated Darwin (perhaps excessively) from the constraints of analogical reasoning and hence is an extreme- ly significant episode. 56. Besides the Origin and its earlier versions, see Darwin's letter to Asa Gray, 5 September 1857, Life and Letters, 1, 477--482. 57. Darwin, Autobiography, p. 42. 58. Compare, however, Kohn, "Theories to Work By," pp. 137-138. 59. Darwin, Origin, p. 4. 321</page><page sequence="20">JOHN F. CORNELL It had long remained to me an inexplicable problem how the neces- sary degree of modification could have been effected, and it would have thus remained for ever, had I not studied domestic productions, and thus acquired a just idea of the power of Selection. As soon as I had fully realized this idea, I saw, on reading Malthus on Popu- lation, that Natural Selection was the inevitable result of the rapid increase of all organic beings.60 Why did Darwin insist on the apparent analogy from art to nature, even by implication? Analogical argument is valuable because it takes us from something better known to something less known, in order to illuminate the latter. Art is more familiar to human beings than the processes of nature. But Darwin had his Malthusian insight before he attempted an analogical argument: he already knew about the effect of population pressure in nature. So there is no analogical demon- stration or illumination for Darwin here. The question, "Has nature any process analogous?" must be taken not as analogical but as rhetorical. Because as admirers of Darwin's works we often assume his conclusions, we may easily miss such distinctions. But if we are really to understand the Origin's place in history, we must see that persuading readers of a whole new vision of nature is simply not the same as demonstrating it from necessary and sufficient first principles. Only by considering the problems of persuasion and of envisioning organic transformation can we explain why Darwin's account of his discovery relying on analogy should become an implicit part of the presentation of his theory, and possibly part of his own outlook. What Darwin doubtless experienced, and wanted his reader to experience, is the potency of an analogical understanding of nature. An analogy from art is nothing if not easy to follow; moreover, it enables us to grasp nature as a whole. This is necessary, after all, in order to argue for the historical occurrence of a full-scale transformation of life, and not simply for one process of organic change. The apparent virtues of the analogy for Darwin's purposes are absolutely crucial; as we shall see, his entire vision could not logically or empirically be obtained by analogical reasoning, although it could be enhanced by using analogy carefully but rhetorically. So our lesson is not simply the retrospective one that Darwin should have followed the advice of A. R. Wallace 60. Darwin, Variation of Plants and Animals, p. 10. This version, which gives an intervening role to Darwin's Malthusian conception, compares tavorably with that in his letter to Wallace, 6 April 1859, More Letters, I, 1 8. 322</page><page sequence="21">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature to avoid the analogy and stick to his "Malthusian" views. The use of analogy does make Darwin's view more persuasive, but only so long as it is not taken too seriously. Before analyzing the analogical side of the Origin, let us look at the development of Darwin's perspective once he hit upon the analogy and began to develop his famous "long argument." On several points we can see him completing the turn away from his original perspective by which art is inferior to nature, and working out a view of natural beings as essentially comparable to artificial products - a view that we have characterized as technological. One important change, which Hodge rightly links to the discovery of the breeding analogy,6' is Darwin's new emphasis on chance con- genital peculiarities as the foundation of nature's picking, the view of variation that characterizes his more polished presentations. It appears in the last transmutation notebook, shortly before the first enunciation of his rhetorical strategy using analogical reasoning, but months after the original analogical insight. Darwin refers there to his principle, "the destruction of all the less hardy ones &amp; the preservation of ac- cidental hardy seedlings [which] sift out the weaker ones" (E Ill - 112). What is important here is that organic variability is described entirely from a technological viewpoint. Recall what has come before and what is to come after. Darwin had been deeply concerned with the various causes initiating organic change, and he had conceived these considering the organism being acted upon and acting in its natural environment. He would continue to maintain several hypotheses about the origin of variation. But identification of the causes of variation eventually became irrelevant to his argument about selection, a force external to the organism operating upon it. In the final argument about natural selection, varia- tion became simply a premise. The passage represents, therefore, the abandonment of his phil- osophical interest in the natural and internal causes of change; his interest is transformed by the technological perspective of the breeder. Darwin's very reference to "accidental" change appears to have been provoked by his reading of the horticulturalists Joseph Banks and William Herbert.62 For these breeders, as for the final Darwinian 61. See above. 62. See Gavin de Beer's notes (3-6) in Darwin's Notebooks on Transmutation, II, 172. Cf., Darwin's notes on John Macculloch's Proofs and ilustrations of the 323</page><page sequence="22">JOHN F. CORNELL theory, the exact causes of variation in organisms do not really matter, so long as variations are plentiful. Breeders are interested in changing domestic races, not in understanding their natural origin and character. The breeders' perspective might throw light on the conundrum of how chance and mechanism are combined in Darwin's doctrine: how can Darwin call variation accidental when he maintains that it is caused deterministically? The difficulty is usually disposed of in roughly the terms Darwin himself suggested in the Origin, that "chance" only denotes our ignorance of causes.63 This view may be traced to Paley's Natural Theology: "The appearance of chance will always bear a proportion to the ignorance of the observer." Darwin's view of chance variations, like Paley's view of chance organic growths, is also linked to their not being designed.64 Yet Darwin's view of chance resembles Paley's precisely because both assume a technological perspective - a mechanistic, utilitarian one in Paley's case, and an agricultural, utilitarian one in Darwin's. The kind of knowledge the breeder pursues is skill in controlling natural processes for his own ends. The variation in nature that is not for the sake of the breeder but is accidental to his purposes cannot on that account be said to be accidental to an evolving organism or to nature as a whole; the breeder necessarily takes a particular, technological view. In the same vein, for breeders variation is the material on which they practice their art. In the Origin Darwin uses the word "material" to refer not just to variation under domestication and in breeders' hands, but to variation in nature which is to be "seized" by other Attributes of God, transcribed as "Essays on Theology and Natural Selection" in Paul Barrett, ed., Metaphysics, Materialism, and the Evolution of Mind: Early Writings of Charles Darwin (Chicago: University of C'hicago Press, 1980), p. 156 (msp. 2): "But are we certain that these are necessary adaptations - may they not be accidental? We have good reason to know that they would not be detri- mental accidents, and domesticated variations show us accidents may become hereditary . . . if man takes care they are not detrimental." This passage reaffirms the technological context of perceiving these "accidents" as the alleged source of natural transformation. 63. Darwin, Origin, p. 131. Sylvan Schweber has shown, in "The Origin of the Origin Revisited," J. Hist. Biol., 10 (1977), 264-274, that this view of chance was commonly held among nineteenth-century scientists. 64. Paley, Natural Theology, chap. 26, p. 413, and chap. 5, secs. 2--3, pp. 58-62. The reviewer of the present essay kindly brought Paley's teaching on this point to my attention. Utility and design are related in natural theology, as are nonutility and chance; hence the nonutility of variation must be a significant part of Darwin's understanding of "accidental" variation. 324</page><page sequence="23">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature forces of selection.65 This view of variability, so complementary to natural selection, does, as Hodge observed,/' make knowledge of the causes of variation unnecessary; but the important corollary is that it makes selection of some kind appear necessary for any particular organic transformation, and so conditions the ground of the theory beforehand. It encourages us to look at the very problem of evolution from a technological point of view. Darwin's commitment to his selection theory of development seems to have been enhanced by his sense of the technical progress of his century. Continuing to read eagerly in the literature of breeding well after having applied the motif of breeding to nature, he writes in his copy of Youatt's volume on Cattle this marginal remark: "As this simple principle [of selection] only lately discovered even in most reliable practice, no wonder not discovered as theory of species."67 Darwin is saying, then, that it is reasonable that he should have the good fortune of discovering the correct account of the origin of species because of the historical novelty of the agricultural achievement he has incorporated into his theory. The observation is significant because it confirms that Darwin's creation of an analogy from breeding helped convince him that he indeed had the mechanism for the production of natural diversity. Furthermore, it underscores his implicit belief that the understanding of nature is a matter of acquiring technical mastery over it. The 1842 and 1844 sketches of Darwin's theory further develop 65. Darwin, Origin, pp. 37, 40, 45, 46. 66. Hodge, "Darwin and Natural Selection." 67. (Youatt,) Cattle: Their Breeds, Management, and Diseases (London: Baldwin &amp; Cradock, 1834), p. 522; Darwin Library copy, read by Darwin 26 March 1840, according to P. Vorzimmer, "Darwin's Reading Notebooks," J. Hist. Biol., 10 (1977), 123. Related to Darwin's indirect reliance on the unique agri- cultural progress of his day are his comparisons in the Origin ot nature to human industrial improvement. The suggestion that we contemplate "every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen" (p. 486) clearly must be seen in the context of the enthusiasm of Victorians about what the industrial revolution was accom- plishing. Yet, just as clearly, the comparison is invalid, since even the progress of invention encouraged by favorable economic environments required the insight and contrivance of existing, natural beings - the inventors - as well as the interest of other existing, natural beings - the consumers. Like Darwin's use of the breeding analogy, this analogy ignores the human agent as part of nature. 325</page><page sequence="24">JOHN F. CORNELL his implicit technological approach. In contrast to the more brilliant Origin, we see him laboring to make the difficult analogy of breeding work. The idea of selection as something that counteracts nature (instead of imitating or imaging it) is relatively prominent in the 1842 and 1844 sketches. The blending of different variants and acciden- tal crosses appear as the natural course of events, which man must control.68 In contrast, the problem of intercrossing appears late in the exposition of the Origin, after variation and the forces of selec- tion have been described.69 In the Origin Darwin's discussion of the breeder's art emphasizes the "accumulation" of variation in a particular direction;70 this would seem a neutral term, capable of accommodating both art and nature, were it not for the questions of in whose direction and from whose perspective variation is accumulated in each case. It is interesting that the term "artificial selection" is especially rare with Darwin;7' again, the breeder's activity does not represent a peculiar (artificial) corner of the world, but possibly nature as a whole. The relation of nature to art has been transformed from one of superiority to one of essential equality, interpreted in the general terms of selective action. In connection with the problem of an agent external to nature, Darwin's initial statements of the analogy should be noted. He moves speculatively, in the 1842 essay, from the breeder to a "being infinitely more sagacious than man";72 in the 1844 version, Darwin elaborates in long paragraphs on the imaginary Overseer of nature who, without temporal or geographic limits, can select chance variations for the benefits of all organisms.73 The rhetorical association of this image with Paley's Designer is often recognized, though its association with Descartes's technologically influenced divine Mechanic should also be borne in mind; for it is not merely a religious culture but a technological 68.

What is also overlooked is that Darwin's image - of a divine Breeder with almost total external control - is one strict (if incredible) avenue for working out an analogue to man's breeding. This idea, however, would not be consonant with Darwin's vision. He simply substitutes for this imaginary, technicomorphic god his doctrine of a similar power called natural selection, without elabo- rating on that additional transition. That is how the earliest sketches unfold.74 Darwin thus increases without limit the possible power of external circumstances over organic change, without having argued analogically or otherwise. He could not have been satisfied with the aborted analogy, for he abandoned the imaginary Selecting Deity in writing his larger work; but the problem of the logical transition from breeding to natural selection remained. THE ANALOGY OF ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL SELECTION We have seen that almost from the moment Darwin hits upon the analogy of the breeder and nature, his conception of evolution is advanced by rhetoric and imagination. He pursues less an analogical argument than a conceptual realignment of the relation of breeding and nature. In order to grasp the difference between Darwin's use of analogy and reasoned analogical argument, let us pretend that we do not know the doctrine of evolution by natural selection and try to reason about the genesis of organic species by analogy from breeding. 74. Darwin, "Sketch of 1842," pp. 45-48, and Darwin, "Essay of 1844," pp. 114-121. In all these early versions Darwin intends that "natural selection" become the ultimate agent, analogical to the breeder, and he always settles on using the term in that way. But the intention, grasped by all who have been influenced by the Origin, is not the same as the argument. Indeed, Darwin im- proves his presentation of natural selection as the almost omnipotent analogue of the breeder. In the 1857-58 beginning of Darwin's "big book," for example, he maintains close conceptual ties between the struggle for existence and natural selection, so that they seem at times interchangeable: the struggle for existence appears as a means of selection (Darwin, Natural Selection. p. 175; also see p. 214). This would seem to be as it should, given that the struggle for existence represents manifold organic beings' continual elimination of one another, and exertion of a kind of external pressure. But the need for an agent with super- human and even supernatural power and control would dictate that natural selection be brought clearly beyond the struggle for existence, and absorb the latter's complexity of power into a single limitless abstraction. That is more how natural selection finally appears in the first edition of the Origin, where some of its last ties to the struggle for existence have been removed (see p. 61). 327</page><page sequence="26">JOHN F. CORNELL Darwin himself invites us to compare varieties of a species that man has developed with species that nature has evolved. The stable, the kennel, the greenhouse, the garden - each might be seen as a microcosm of the entire living world. Diversity in the phenomena of living nature as a whole is what this comparison aims at understanding. What is responsible for the diversity of domestic breeds? This is a ques- tion on which Darwin for a time had competing ideas. He fmally saw what several earlier naturalists missed, that "the effect of physical condi- tions is not ... so great" (D 23), but that the separation and inter- breeding of a specific group of organisms was more important. Human selection, working with specific goals in view, is a requisite part of the production of domestic breeds. The vast variety of these breeds - the many kinds of dogs, or horses, or apples - represents the achievement and maintenance of many goals by the device of the breeders. How does one reason from art to nature, when in art a multiplicity of human ends have played such an important role? One need not, like Darwin in his early sketch, posit an imaginary cosmic agent acting on living things in order to make the analogy work. (Indeed, this would be more a crude projection, which Darwin did not take literally, rather than an analogy.) A proper analogy would require only that some directive principles analogous to the breeders' ends, even causes working within organisms, be supposed in the natural sphere to produce organic diversity. Granted, such an analogy may or may not be fruitful for thinking about evolution, especially about how change occurs in particular cases. But if one is serious about goal- directed artistic activity in conceiving diversity in nature, some such conclusion about natural directive powers is required.75 Analogy from art, taken strictly, leads to this conclusion rather than to an environmentalist or Darwinian idea of the causes of natural diversity. The case is different if we try to form an analogy from the other side of the problem, so to speak - from the struggle for existence, the external, empirical agent of change, which Darwin discovered independently of reasoning from art. The examples in the Origin are profoundly suggestive: one variety of wheat will crowd out others, depending on climate and soil; one variety of mountain sheep will starve out another in competition for grazing ground.76 Darwin stresses the complexity of causal changes in the struggle for life. Introduce 75. The only important exception is if human thought is separated from nature, as it is in Cartesian dualism and, indirectly, in Darwin's teaching in the Origin. 76.

Insofar as the environment exerts a sort of pressure on any group of organisms, an analogy from environment to breeder can certainly be made: a species' organic and inorganic surroundings can affect it, according to its ability to survive, the way a breeder decides which individuals will live under his care. Once we know something about the environment, as Darwin (and some of the breeders) did, we can connect it to the breeder's action. But this new analogy starts not with man, aiming at variety in his domestic charges, but with the blind power of natural forces. One can show, without first considering the breeder's manifold goals, a general causal power in nature, of uncertain magnitude but working differently in different circumstances so as to be conceivable as "selec- tive" by analogy with the breeder's preservation of certain plants or animals. Yet one thereby ignores the breeder's deliberate efforts that contribute to artificial organic variety, and does not compare diversity in the artistic sphere with diversity in nature as a whole; the analogy from art has not been followed. Hence the adequacy of the natural, environmental power to produce all the organic variety in nature is not known, either from nature or with the help of analogy. One of the fundamental problems for Darwin's explanation of evolution, then, is to show that a natural causal agency, natural selec- tion, is a sufficiently potent cause of evolutionary diversity. Darwin was much more sensitive to this basic difficulty than is recognized by many recent commentators.78 Deeply honest as a theorist, he also had to wrestle with the logic of his presentation as we, his heirs, do not. Darwin acknowledged often enough that his theory presented a prob- lem of degree; the power of his explanation through natural selection diminished the more features of development it was called upon to explain.79 Though seeing the difficulty of amplifying natural selection, 77. Ibid., pp. 73-74. 78. Darwin's difficulty has been addressed in an interesting article by Erling Eng, "The Confrontation between Reason and Imagination: The Example of Darwin," Diogenes (1977), 58-67. 79. See Darwin's "Sketch of 1842," p. 46; Darwin to Asa Gray, 5 September 1857, Life and Letters, 1, 478; Origin, p. 483. Darwin's concern with the extent of his natural mechanism reflects not simply the riskiness in the nineteenth-century context of supposing the evolution of all creatures, but the nineteenth-century 329</page><page sequence="28">JOHN F. CORNELL Darwin apparently tried to surmount it by comparing nature with the breeder. He gained persuasiveness at the expense of strict analogical reasoning. An earlier point may bear repeating: if Darwin is to make a truly illustrative argument from the sphere of breeding, he cannot simply compare it with what he already knows about natural relationships among organisms, or with what he supposes to be the process of trans- formation. Yet the analogy from breeding does not itself lead to natural selection, and consideration of the struggle for life, or com- paring it to the breeder, does not lead to an evident cause of all organic form. This logical impasse becomes Darwin's rhetorical challenge: he can indeed unite his knowledge of natural competition and that of the breeder's power, but how can he make these add up to an argument and explanation for evolution? On the technological side, he has the artful breeder, clearly intent on creative achievements through intel- ligent manipulation of his organic materials; on the natural side, he has the unpurposed environmental causes and an impressive diversity of phenomena. If we look at Darwin's predicament in this way, we can see the significance of several passages of the Origin, passages in which, by mere comparison, Darwin unites the breeder's art and a natural mechanism into a single vision of nature and invokes the power of the different analogies without rigorously pursuing their implications. One such passage treats what Darwin calls "unconscious selection." Its role in his exposition has rarely been discussed,79" though it shows how intent Darwin was on making the comparison of breeding and nature work. It represents a transition from the goal-oriented "methodi- cal selection" of the professional breeder (as we noted earlier, Darwin rarely uses the term "artificial selection") to the automatic process of "natural selection." Unconscious selection, like methodical selection, refers to the continuous human action that alters a species, but in this case the alteration is unintentional and unforeseen. "If there exist savages so barbarous," Darwin hypothesizes, as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully preserved during need for some evident explanation if the very idea of evolution was to be taken seriously. Darwin tended to enhance his argument by stating the uncertainty of natural selection's power as a doubt of its limits, though the two expressions are not equivalent. See Origin, p. 469;Natural Selection, p. 225. 79a. See, however, Secord, "Nature's Fancy," p. 185. 330</page><page sequence="29">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature famines and other accidents, to which savages are so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on.' Then there are the more civilized owners of animals and plants who simply buy and breed the creatures that they prefer. Darwin observes: A man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed. Nevertheless I cannot doubt that this process, continued during centuries, would improve and modify any breed.81 Unconscious selection also occurs when professional breeders do not all work according to exactly the same standard, or when they fall short of perfection, and so change the future of a breed in unexpected ways. Selection pursued with King Charles's spaniel had been so imper- fect, the bemused Darwin tells us, that were the king alive today he would probably not recognize his dog! Now the very category of "unconscious selection" is meant as a bridge between art and Darwin's conception of nature. A bridge it is indeed, but not an argument: for the validity of his conception of nature as a whole is what would itself be in question. Darwin produced a continuum moving from the highly motivated and purposeful activity of the human breeder, to the unskilled and unwitting agency of the savage, to the external events in nature supposed as the main causes of evolution.82 But the necessity of unconscious selection to the unity of this scheme may have led Darwin to overlook its true character. This form of selection is not really unconscious: choices are made by the savages, the buyers, and the breeders according to standards or goals of which they are certainly aware. Moreover, the goals that inform their choices correspond to the developmental results. So they are at least partly responsible for the nature of the transformation, even if as agents they are methodologically unsophisticated and igno- rant of the long-term consequences of their actions. For example, the naturally rare blue parakeet became a fashionable pet in Victorian 80. Darwin, Origin, p. 36. 81. Ibid.,pp.34-35. 8 2. Cf. Darwin, Variation of Plants and A nimals, pp. 3 8 - 39. 331</page><page sequence="30">JOHN F. CORNELL England after one was acquired by the prince; thus the Victorians were responsible for the development of that race, even though no single bird lover planned to change the whole domestic species. It would seem, in fact, that recognizable transformation in a do- mestic creature would take place only to the degree that a common end was pursued by its human keepers. Breeds diverge only where the breeders' actual needs, tastes, or intentions have diverged; goals are relevant wherever human selection is relevant. Unconscious selec- tion, therefore, does not lead us logically to the view of nature as an essentially mechanical process, but rather to a consideration of whether the creative power of selective causes should diminish as the specificity and artfulness of intention is reduced. Unconscious selection may have its effect, but, as Darwin says, it rnust be slower and more haphazard than the skillful breeder's work. The power of natural selection for the production of evolutionary diversity does not become more evident when we consider agents less skillful than the method- ical breeder, though Darwin's aim is certainly to lead the reader thus to natural selection as the principal process of nature. Another possible bridge from the design of art to the proposed mechanism of nature occurs in the opening chapter of the Origin.83 Darwin refers to the "domestic animals kept by uncivilized man." Savages live much closer to nature - this is the point - and their domestic beasts are not pampered in such circumstances, but they "almost always have to struggle for their own food, at least during certain seasons."' Such half-domestic, half-wild animals are as de- pendent upon natural circumstances as upon man's choosing and control and the varieties that result are products of both nature and art. But the observation that nature and art can each have its effect on the same group of animals does not display nature as primarily a selectionlike activity, nor does it ease the transition between man's intelligent, purposive process and the proposed physical, nonpurposive process. Darwin has indicated a place where the effect of two kinds of causes may well be compounded and confused, but the dissimilarity of the causes themselves remains as much a problem as ever. The difficulty in Darwin's comparison is not only the contrast of human art and purposeless mechanism, but also the fact that the actual products of nature are more impressive and "creative" than 83. In Variation of Plants and Animals unconscious selection and the savages' domestic beasts are found together, linking methodological and natural selection. 84. Darwin, Origin, p. 38. 332</page><page sequence="31">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature those of the breeder's art, whereas Darwin's natural mechanism is not obviously as designing. To make natural selection appear adequate to produce the phenomena of nature, Darwin advances several argu- ments, all of which are well known but none of which constitutes a conclusive demonstration. The most important concerns time: "How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods."85 It is time that has to make up the tremendous apparent difference between the effects of art and nature for Darwin; for, in kinds of causal re- sources, nature cannot be better supplied than the breeder with his techniques.86 Yet the reliance on time cannot be a conclusive empirical argument for a particular mechanism of evolution; it can as easily apply to other mechanisms. And time cannot even appear causally adequate for Darwin's mechanism without a reinterpretation of the natural phenomena that have been produced. The effects of nature must be supposed to correspond to what is producible by external, environ- mental causes. With regard to the appearances of nature, it is significant that Darwin does not emphasize the ''wild luxuriance" of organic forms, as he was inclined to do in The Voyage of the Beagle. 87 In the Origin Darwin suggests a minimalist interpretation. Usefulness for survival becomes the sufficient characterization of all organic features. 85. Ibid., p. 84. 86. Although it may appear in chap. 4 of the Origin (p. 84) that Darwin is granting some superiority of nature (conceived as natural selection) to art, in his final conclusion (p. 459) he speaks more consistently of nature working "not by means superior to, though analogous with, human reason." 87. See Darwin, 7he Voyage of the Beagle (London: Murray, 1890), pp. 24-26, 32, 365, 387-388, 474-475. It is much more usual for Darwin in this work to extol the superfluous diversity and aesthetic quality of nature, the elegance and novelty of vegetable forms, and so on; whereas the utilitarian or technological attitude is almost entirely absent. See also Stanley E. Hyman, The Tangled Bank (New York: Atheneum 1962), p. 15. It does not seem that Darwin's feeling for natural beauty ever diminished under the impact of his own theory. See John Campbell, "Nature, Religion, and Emotional Response: A Reconsideration of Darwin's Affective Decline," Vict. Stud., 18 (1974), 159- 174. The theoretical and the aesthetic were probably fused in Darwin's response to living things, as Francis Darwin once suggested, though not ultimately in his explicit scientific teaching. See F. Darwin cited in Charles Darwin and the Voyage of the Beagle, ed. Nora Barlow (New York: Philosophical Library, 1946), p. 152. 333</page><page sequence="32">JOHN F. CORNELL And so Darwin's account moves not from organic diversity under breeders to that in nature, but from utility for man to utility in nature; and a mechanistic view of life emerges. As man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious selection, what may not nature effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters; nature cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to any living being. She can act ... on the whole machinery of life.a Hence Darwin recommends that we look at the phenomena of nature in a new way that accommodates that proposed causal theory of origins. Parallel to the downplaying of the effects of nature is the amplifi- cation of the capacity of the environmental causes designated by the term "struggle for existence." The term "natural selection," used in addition to and distinctly from "struggle for existence," doubles the chance of reifying abstract terms and investing them with ex- traordinary power.89 Taken by itself, the notion of a struggle for existence refers to the competition within a varied population, and assumes variety among organisms. If Darwin had referred to his natural causal agents using the term "struggle for existence" exclusively, it would appear that the theory presupposes the production of a variety of living things, rather than concludes with an explanation of organic variety. The struggle, to put it another way, is an ostensibly limited cause in the origination of organic variety. 88. Darwin, Voyage, p. 83. The term "machinery" reflects, of course, the early modern technological conception of nature preceding Darwin's selectionism. This conception, which nonetheless harmonizes with Darwin's, does not seem of particular interest to him before he has his own technological interpretation of evolution. Again, the tendency of The Voyage of the Beagle is to contrast the "mechanical power" of physical processes and "the agency of the vital laws" (pp. 442, 446-447). In The Voyage Darwin is at a loss for words to express the superiority of nature to artificial conceptions. Even in calling the tropical land a "wild and luxuriant hothouse . . . made by Nature for herself" (p. 475), Darwin's point is that this "fail[s] to communicate a just idea of the vegetation." Darwin's reference in The Voyage to the Galapagos finches, which look as if one species were "taken and modified for different ends" (p. 365), was added in the new edition, after Darwin had sketched his selection theory. See Life and Letters, I, 366. 89. See note 74. 334</page><page sequence="33">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature But the term "natural selection" need suffer no such restriction: it connotes an association with the breeder, according to Darwin's intention, and does not focus attention on prior variety, be it that assumed in competitors for existence or in organisms from which the selection of the breeder must begin.9' Natural selection might seem more like the breeder once it is transformed into a cause. Darwin defmes natural selection initially as if it were a result, an effect of the struggle for existence - "the preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious ones."9' The use of substantive verb forms, in both the name and the definition ("selection," "preservation," 4"rejection"), allow it to become a causal power over and upon living things, not unlike the Breeder-Deity of the sketches of the 1840s.1 Its causal power might thus be rhetorically enlarged, even personified, as indeed we see it in the Origin. Natural selection is at one point described as daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life.93 Darwin certainly intends natural selection to designate a mere sum of environmental causes. But does that sum include all the possible causes or tendencies in organisms contributing to evolutionary diversity? Such a question would not necessarily arise in comparing natural selection with the breeder's power over his organisms, the main agent of artificial change. This is not the only way in which Darwin's use of the breeding 90. Darwin, Origin, p. 61. 9 1. Ibid., p. 8 1. 92. The conflation of cause and effect in the term "natural selection" has a parallel in Darwin's lack of clarity about whether it is an analogy or a metaphor he has produced. He suggests in some places that it is an analogy (Origin, pp. 112, 459; More Letters, I, 152), but insists on metaphor in a later edition of the Origin (Darwin, Origin of Species: Variorum Text, ed. M. Peckham (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1951 ), p. 165). With respect to effects, Darwin must have aimed at analogy; with respect to causes, he did not develop the analogical correlations but had to remain in the domain of metaphor, making a mechanical nature resemble man. 93. Darwin, Origin, p. 84. 335</page><page sequence="34">JOHN F. CORNELL analogy augmented the power of natural selection without fully de- monstrating it. The "principle of the divergence of character," which also relies on the practice of breeding, provided another opportunity for the same conceptual development. This principle would supposedly explain how environmental agents could produce the rich diversity of nature,94 and so was considered by Darwin an extremely important corollary to his theory. As Dov Ospovat has shown, it was the French zoologist Milne-Edward's writing on the embryonic divergence of forms that brought the problem of evolutionary diversity boldly to Darwin's attention.95 It was the breeding analogy (which Ospovat does not treat), however, that was decisive in Darwin's account of divergence. As he notes in the Origin, the breeder's selection of horses for two different ends involves the exclusion of animals "between" his goals until two distinct groups are achieved.' Although something similar may occur in nature, in geographicallv divergent environments, this alone cannot establish that such external causes affect all the phenomena of organic diversity. It is here that the breeding analogy may have been misleading.97 According to the principle of divergence, as Darwin enunciates it, more living beings can be supported in a place the more diverse they are in particular habits and requirements.98 This is a superb insight on Darwin's part. It is significant, though, that he refers to the "great benefit" derived, suggesting action toward an end. Yet the environment cannot act with this end in view, as the breeder can; neither the environment nor natural selection (however Darwin may be distinguishing them here) can "lead to"99 diversity or promote it as a general principle. The initial divergence or radiation of varieties 94. See Darwin, Autobiography, p. 43. 95. Ospovat, The Development of Darwin's Theory, pp. 175 -176. 96. Darwin, Origin, p. 112. 97. Indeed, in his discussion of divergence Darwin glides from the breeder's sphere of influence to nature in general, applying the "principle" of steady divergence in both cases, but without examining the difference in kinds of causes working in art and in the natural realm. Hence the application suffers from the same weakness as Darwin's transition from breeding to nature. Not surprisingly, it is not always clear whether the principle of divergence, like natural selection, is defined as a cause and a power or an effect and a result. Compare the Origin, p. 112 (where Darwin refers to the "principle of divergence, causing differences"), and the more explicit definition (involving hypothetically given diversity that allows a greater quantity of living things) on p. 114. 98. Darwin, Origin, p. 114. 99. Ibid., pp. 116, 127. 336</page><page sequence="35">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature must always be achieved first for it to confer any advantage. Darwin's suggestive experiment - depending on a human experimenter - with two plots of ground, one sown with one species of grass, the other with several genera, reveals the advantage of diversity in all environ- ments, but not the actual causes of organic diversity in the nonhuman natural world, and not whether diversification will ever work beyond the pressure of environment once its demands are satisfied. Significantly, his first example of natural divergence of species, in this section of the Origin, allows us to supply some directional causality: the example is car- nivorous animals and their habits - that is, psychological (not en- vironmental) causes possibly contributing to the divergent courses of variation. Darwin's other example (of plants sown experimentally) and his abstract diagram of the development of diversity presuppose the diversity of types or the incipient species which the environmental agency, or natural selection, is alleged to create."? In short, then, Darwin's account of divergence still leaves questions unanswered.1'O Yet the technological analogy with breeding promotes the sense of explanatory power insofar as it refers us tacitly to the dominant and directional action of man which can produce diversity, but it cannot assure us that the counterpart of human, external action in nature is what is always responsible for evolutionary diversity. THE RELATIVITY OF SELECTION I have tried not to anticipate the Darwinian doctrine of evolution by natural selection in the analysis, so as to appreciate more fully Darwin's rhetorical and epistemological situation. In particular, I have tried to point out the tension that Darwin had to try to resolve between the purposive artistry of breeding and the mechanical evolution he envisioned. The gap between man and mechanistic nature seems as hard to bridge as that between res cogitans and res extensa in Descartes's philosophy. Yet there is a possible bridge between man and nonhuman nature 1 00. Ibid., pp. i1 3-114, 117. 101. It is interesting that post-Darwinians, such as George Romanes and John Gulick, found fault with precisely Darwin's attempt at an analogical solution to the problem of divergence, and that they saw the need to supplement natural selection with spontaneous varietal isolation and interspecific infertility. See John E. Lesch, "The Role of Isolation in Evolution," Isis, 66 (1975), 483-503, esp. pp. 486-487. The criticism implied, for these theorists, a less utilitarian interpretation of evolution and morphology. 337</page><page sequence="36">JOHN F. CORNELL based on analogy. This is the analogy between the actions of man and those of other animals. This analogy can be grasped fully and empirically, as Darwin's own comparison of the breeder and the cause of all evolution cannot. It does not lead to a conception of nature as a sort of technological object. Nor does it lead to Darwin's vision of nature altogether. Hence, it may help us to see more clearly the prob- lem of the scope of natural selection. Darwin himself recommended making analogies between the activities of human and other animals. Such concrete comparisons supported his inquiry into human evolution beginning with his earliest reflections. "Arguing from man to animals is philosophical," he wrote in the N notebook.'" He referred to this approach, following Bacon and the nineteenth-century philosopher of science John Herschel, as a "travelling" or "frontier" instance of reasoning. Some of Darwin's keenest insights concern the similarity of man to lower animals.103 While the analogy of human and animal activities is not a major theme of the Origin,"0 examples are nonetheless present, especially in the chapter on instinct. Consider the lovely comparison of the musician and the caterpillar: As in repeating a well-known song, so in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a person be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is generally forced to recover the habitual train of thought: so P. Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which had completed its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage of construction, and put it into a hammock completed only up to the third stage, the caterpillar simply re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of construction. If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third 102.

Although there are not many bona fide breeders in nature, there are some comparable animal activities, which Darwin himself examines in the Origin. Insects, especially ants, perform something reminiscent of domestication. There are slave-making ants, for example, that employ ants of another species in various capacities supporting their nest. Another species of ant domesticates aphids in order to milk them. Darwin certainly saw the similarity between human slave owners and domesticators, and their insect counterparts; he makes these comparisons casually in letters and in the large manuscript, Natural Selection, which preceded the Origin.'" The analogy is made inadvertently in the Origin, where Darwin reports that he himself played the part of the ant in a dis- appointing attempt to milk some aphids by tickling and stroking them! 107 Beyond these insect domesticators, there are other natural relation- ships reminiscent of human cultivation. Earlier naturalists had made the connection between insects that fertilize flowers by feeding on their nectar and gardeners who further their favorite floral varieties by gathering and spreading choice pollen."08 Human development of plants and animals is a form of predation in which elimination of some individuals is crucial. The keeper of the rabbit hutch might, for example, be compared to the fox who pursues the weakest rabbit and thus improves the group. Such a view of selection need not even be restricted to animals. It could also be said, for instance, that such-and-such soil "selects" such-and-such wheat, in a way analogous to the farmer. Virtually all ecological relationships could be described in this way, and the rela- tional aspect of environmental change would remain perfectly clear. Most important, from this standpoint the idea of natural selection 105. Darwin, Origin, p. 208. Robert J. Richards kindly pointed out to me that this example was adapted by Darwin from William Kirby and William Spence, Introduction to Entomology, 4 vols. (2nd ed., London, 1818). 106.

CORNELL would not be abstract or speculative; man would not be compared with nature as a whole, or with natural selection, as the primary prin- ciple of organic development. Instead, his control over other organisms would be seen as comparable to the effect of animals on one another, and of environmental elements on organisms. We would be constantly reminded, that man is not outside the system he is describing and trying to understand, not over and above nature as if it were simply a technological object, but a part of it, emerging within it. This suggests something important about the foundations and character of Darwin's teaching, especially about the idea of selection as the main key to evolution. For if man's relation with other organisms resembles those between other organisms themselves, then it would seem not an adequate basis for an absolute conception of the develop- ment of living things, but rather a relative standpoint for illuminating changes and adjustments between existing beings." There would seem to be a "relativity" principle written into the very idea of selec- tion. Selection is an activity necessarily relative to a given selecting agent; it might appear doubtful that, on the grounds of breeding other organisms, man should have the key to all natural organic change. He stands not simply over nature as a breeder but within it.110 Even if we grant that man's relation to his domestic animals and plants represents a unique degree of control for any natural being, it does not follow that this control supports a conception of nature or organic evolution as a whole. On the contrary, it raises the question of how man's mastery of nature - that is, technology -- affects what he studies and the way he describes or understands it. There thus arises from the "relativity" of natural selection a unique paradox regarding an exclusively selectionist interpretation of the history of life. The more one would make of natural selection as the creative force of evolutionary transformation, on the original analogy of breeding, the greater one must estimate man's position in nature and the metaphysical meaning of his mastery; the more separate from and equal to "Nature" man must logically appear. An extreme selectionist 109. Darwin himself saw his "solution" to the problem of evolution as reveal- ing the relative character of adaptation. (See Origin, p. 472, and Autobiography, p. 90.) But he did not see that this logically implies the relativity of his mechan- ism of change. 110. Paul Ehrlich and Richard Holm implied that there is something Euclidean (Newtonian?) about the Darwinian view of evolution, which might need revision - something perhaps presumptuously absolute. See their "Patterns and Popula- tions," Science, 137 (1962), 656 -657. 340</page><page sequence="39">Analogy and Technology in Darwin's Vision of Nature interpretation of nature is bound to a man-nature comparison, as Darwin in his own way sketches it. The paradox, of course, is that to the degree one thus magnifies the powers of selection in nature on the analogy of a human power, one undermines the conception of man as but one organism evolving with others, having no privileged position in nature. It is hard to see logically how to mitigate this paradox in the relation between knowledge of interorganismic selection and an absolute assumption of selection as the most significant mechan- ism of organic change."11 Can we assume that one activity of a techno- logically sophisticated animal should be capable of providing the privileged perspective on nature's most essential workings? Or do human bias and historical tendency favor such an interpretation in place of certain knowledge? Darwin, it should be noted, does not develop theoretically any analogy of man as artificial selector with other animal agents. He does not think of using his own animal illustrations in this way. He employs natural selection abstractly when examining bees' relation to flowers (the flowers are "selected," but not by the insects),"2 and also when discussing ants' use of aphids in the Origin. 113 Observing the predation of wolves upon deer, Darwin focuses on the similarity of wolves to man's grayhounds, rather than the similarity of wolves to man. He might have grasped the problem raised by this partial use of his analogy when he commented on one of the criticisms of the Origin. Some readers objected, Darwin writes, "that the term selection implies conscious choice in the animals which have become modified; and it has even been urged that as plants have no volition, natural selection is not applicable to them!" 114 The Darwinian exclamation point suggests astonishment. Yet the naive objection would have implicated the man-centered analogy of breeding, had it focussed on organisms as modifiers rather than as 111. Darwin himself in the Origin does not distinguish the theory of evolution from that of natural selection, which has always made it difficult to consider the ranges of application of the two theories. 1 12. Darwin says that flowers were "selected," but not by the insects (Origin, p. 92). A precedent for this usage on the relation of flowers and insects can be found in his "Notes on the Habits of Bees" (ms. 46.2, Cambridge University Library), where he says that "the tempting cause was increased by natural selec- tion" (9). Dated June 1841, this is one of the earliest references to "natural selection" I have found by Darwin. In early 1840 one finds him referring simply to "selection" - see his copies of Youatt on Cattle and Smith on Dogs. Cf. Limoges, La Selection naturelle, pp. 104-105. 1 13.

Elsewhere Darwin shows high interest in comparisons of human beings and other organisms. By avoiding any discussion of their similarity as artificial breeders in the Origin, he leaves untouched the very question that would suggest the relativity of the basis of his doctrine. The similarity between Darwin's rhetorical situation and Cartesian dualism is in fact not a superficial one. To be sure, Darwin's deep feelings for the beauty and the pathos of nature, for our animal "breth- ren in pain," 1" seem to set him far apart from Descartes. Nonetheless, in his ultimate intention to give a technically evident account of the history of organic nature, Darwin does take part in the Cartesian project to explain the whole World and Man 116 according to their origins. So it cannot be surprising that we find at the inner core of Darwin's work a Cartesian tension between man and mechanism, and in its key explanatory theme - breeding - a total separation of man from animals. The Darwinian position, while providing a most plausible account of evolution, requires that one ignore such a paradox, just as one must ignore the paradox that Descartes left unsolved regarding the union of mind and body. Darwin's difficulties are, moreover, historically linked to Descartes in the mechanistic ideal for the knowledge of nature. Whatever intel- lectual genealogy might be constructed linking Descartes to Darwin through Newton and Lyell or the Victorian philosophers of science, there can be little doubt that part of the power of Darwin's theory is that it draws upon a long tradition concerning what is "scientific." There could probably be no new vision of nature in the nineteenth century, no re-vision of the old mechanistic creationism, that did not preserve the mechanistic and positivistic categories of modern thought 17 and advance a claim of total explanation. There could be no evolutionary perspective, popularly or professionally com- pelling, unless it could be shown that within the scope of science as currently defined there might be some better view of the history of nature than special creation. Darwin himself gives us a clue to the scientific requirement. The idea of transformation, he writes in the introduction to the Origin, 115. NBT B, p. 232.

The late Dov Ospovat made a particular point of the fact that Darwin's principal interest became establishing evolution and not his theory of the mechanism of evolution, natural selection. Ospovat gave substantial evidence for this remarkable insight - it is supported by Darwin's letters and autobiographical reflections 121 and we could cite, in addition, a sentence in the conclusion of the Origin that seems to reveal Darwin's deepest intentions, that his em- phasis is not on his particular mechanism of change: "When the views entertained in this volume on the origin of species, or when analogous views are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history." 122 It seems that Darwin was committed to establishing the genealogical descent and diversification of organisms, and the process of natural selection, but that he could not be absolutely certain about the former resulting only from the latter. Was the difficult argument for natural selection as the principal cause of evolution indirectly imposed upon one who aimed to make evolution convincing? He who succeeds in impressing his readers, Darwin said in another context, deserves all the credit for a theory.'23 Indeed, this would make sense of the rhetorical 118. Darwin, Origin, p. 3.

CORNELL extension of natural selection, through the analogy of the breeder, to the general explanation of evolution. It made evolution at last con- ceivable both to nineteenth-century scientists and to the reading public. Ospovat also recognized that "ways of seeing nature" '24 have a subtle relation to a variety of social and intellectual trends. He saw Darwin's theory as constructed with "ideologically loaded concepts" - that is, with concepts whose ideological origin Darwin may not have considered - and, as a result, as "suitable for the age of industrial capitalism".'25 Whatever the truth in this historical understanding of Darwin, we may also do well to consider the effects of a context even broader than that of nineteenth-century English society and economy. The conception of knowledge as based on man's external manipulation of things must be counted a formative assumption of modern civi- lization, one that could lead Darwin to rely upon a technological analogy to persuade his contemporaries of evolution and bring them into a new era of biology.
