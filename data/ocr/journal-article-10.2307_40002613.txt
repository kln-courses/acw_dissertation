<plain_text><page sequence="1">E. Q Stedman and the Invention of Victorian Poetry MICHAEL COHEN HAVE LONG DESPISED "THE GENTEEL TRADITION" OF THE AMERICAN nineteenth century. According to the vast majority of American literary histories written since 1915 (when Van Wyck Brooks published his polemic America's Coming of Age), the genteel tradition (and nineteenth-century America more generally) derived its poetic norms and ideals from the forms, imagery, and language of foreign sources, and it expressed a sentimental, bourgeois ideology at odds with the subversive work of truly great American writers. Only after the liberating Modernist revolution of the early twentieth century would America have its own poetic tradition. As Andrew DuBois and Frank Lentricchia tell the story, "to many appreciative American readers at the end of the nineteenth century," the genteel writers were synonymous with poetry. Other readers- Eliot, Frost, and espe- cially Pound among them- saw things differently, saw these displaced late Victorians, this genteel cabal, filling the day's major magazines of culture, saw these fat old hens styling themselves as wise old owls . . . saw these men squatting out the inadequate eggs of the day, their boring poems. Against this intolerable situation, the modernists made their attack. When the feathers finally settled, a handful of expatriates and the scattered nativist and homebody had already proved that the young century might be an American century, for poetry at least. . . . The day was won by this historical movement, this modernism} The Modernists, then, resented not only the "boring poems" of the genteel writers but more significantly the cultural control they exercised, and by breaking the power of this "cabal," Modernism effected much more than a revolution in taste. In other words, the key target of Modernist rage was not genteel poems but genteel poetics, a system of "values," which DuBois and Lentricchia indict without really specifying. But the phrase "displaced late Victorians" is telling: not only do the genteel poets hold on to a set of values hopelessly out of date (hence "late"), they also mistakenly endorse a tradition that is not even theirs (hence they are "displaced Victorians"). Looking to Britain, the Victorian American "cabal" endorsed a sense of American poetry 165</page><page sequence="2">166 / VICTORIAN POETRY that only (and weakly) met the terms of a foreign poetics, and in so doing they missed the vital work being created at home, so that only in the twentieth century would the real American literature (Walden, Moby Dick, Leaves of Grass) be recognized. Besides being generally incorrect, this thesis fails to acknowledge an important implication of its terms, namely that "looking eastward" from America might be creative and productive as well as derivative. Americans did not look eastward to an autonomous or pre-existent field or discourse of Victorian poetry; rather, their looking eastward called that field into being. In other words, Americans did look to Britain during the Victorian era, but these Americans did not imitate, they created Victorian poetry. Rather than merely adopting pre-existing British poetic models as paradigms for American poetry, American writers helped to create those models by theorizing and defining Victorian poetry.2 The first modern critical work on the field- the first work to treat nineteenth-century British poetry as a field, separate and separable from the poetry of earlier times and places- was Edmund Clarence Stedman's 1875 Victorian Poets. Shortly after its publication, Stedman wrote to Moncure Con- way that "it is the first attempt thus far to survey the whole course of recent British poetry, from the rise of Tennyson, down to the latest aspirants, upon a consistent method- with analysis of the period, etc., etc., including careful study into both the works and the lives of the leading poets."3 Not only was it the first professional book on the subject, prior to it "the prefix 'Victorian' had not previously become familiar' (LL, p. 1; emphasis in the text). And while Victoria would reign nearly thirty more years, Stedman emphasized that he had been led "to complete the present work" because "I saw that what I term the Victorian period is nearly at an end, and that no consecutive and synthetic examination of its schools and leaders had yet been made."4 The striking fact of an American inventing Victorian poetry is not accidental: Stedman's treatise followed a logic of periodization that went beyond the convenient fact of Victoria's reign, while the transatlanticism embedded in the origins of Victorian poetry played a causal role in the origins of Victorian Poets. His criti- cal work had begun with an effort to review "the course of American poetry, since it may be said to have had a pathway of its own" (VPoets, p. xvi), but he quickly found that "with regard to the causes of the success and failure of our own poets . . . some of the most important were not special, but general: belonging to the period, and equally affecting the verse of the motherland. This led me to make a study of a few British poets. ... In order to formulate my own ideas of poetry and criticism, it seemed to me that I could more freely and graciously begin by choosing a foreign paradigm than by entering upon the home-field" (VPoets, p. xvii). The transatlantic interdependence of nineteenth-century poetry became the ground on which to articulate the various national poetic fields. Not</page><page sequence="3">MICHAEL COHEN/ 167 only were Victorian Poets and Poets of America (1885) the first major synthetic treatments of Victorian poetry, they also helped to mark the emergence of literary criticism as a profession. In his letter to Conway, Stedman claimed that while his treatment of nineteenth-century British poetry may not have been absolutely original, it did mark the origin of a new type of writing on the subject: "English books on the subject have chiefly been compiled by barristers, college-professors, and other laymen. . . . [Victorian Poets] is in a certain sense, professional- not amateur- criticism" (LL, p. 3; emphasis in text). Stedman understood his work to be professional not because he himself made a living writing criticism (he was in fact a broker on the New York Stock Exchange) but because his critical writing followed fully theorized principles: "The real purpose of both the 'Victorian Poets' and 'Poets of America' has been to give the author's views and canons of poetry and the poetic art, and to study a poetic era, and poetic temperaments" (LL, p. 54; emphasis in text). Victorian Poets and Poets of America thus serve as foundational works not only for their respective poetic fields of study, but for the modern practice of literary criticism itself- a practice characterized by, among many other things, a reliance on periodization, national fields, and literary theories. Yet if Sted- man mapped out terrain for the modern professionalized study of poetry, he was not therefore a proponent of what came to be important features of modern literary-critical discourse. For instance, Stedman never taught at a university. He turned down positions at Columbia and Yale, noting however that "if I had accepted any one of the Chairs of Literature which have been offered me, I certainly never should have taught poetry or other creative literature in the technical and pedantic fashion introduced from Germany by our multitudinous Ph. D.'s" (LL, p. 161). He refers here to the discipline of philology, whose institutional center was in Germany. Beginning as early as the 1810s, Americans had gone to German universities for training in philology, the historical and comparative study of languages; upon returning to America, these scholars set up departments of modern languages in Ameri- can universities with the idea of emulating the German pedagogical model. According to Gerald Graff and Michael Warner, these new programs were designed to teach historical linguistic subjects. But "the way one illustrated the Great Vowel Shift or Verner's Law in one's publications and courses was by reading the texts that gave evidence of them. This is where literature came in. In other words, the profession of 'literary studies' was established before it began to consider literature its subject."5 The absorption of literary study by philological discourse occasioned a reaction by non-academic literary crit- ics, who had previously conducted the study of literature through journals like the North American Review and the Atlantic Monthly. Graff and Warner identify this type of literary study as the discourse of belles-lettres, and they chart the origin of twentieth-century literary criticism in the discursive fight</page><page sequence="4">168 / VICTORIAN POETRY over literature between philology and belles-lettres. While Graff and Warner are surely correct to locate the origins of twen- tieth-century literary study in this discursive battle, we should not therefore make a total binary out of the opposition between philology and belles-lettres. Stedman's disdainful comment about German Ph.D.'s unintentionally gives an example of the ambiguous interconnection between the disciplines: if the great American philologists like Francis James Child and H.H. Furness received training in Germany, so did the great nineteenth-century belletrists like George Ticknor and Longfellow. For example, Ticknor's education in Germany enabled him to serve as the first Smith Professor of Belles-lettres at Harvard and gave him the foundation from which he initiated a series of reforms that modernized the university, and it also provided him the op- portunity to purchase the books that launched the Boston Public Library.6 And while Stedman's contempt for mere pedantry and his refusal to accept a professorship seem to position him on the belletristic side of the split, his situation is also more complicated. For even if he did not teach at a university, he did (enthusiastically) participate in the emerging academic discourse of literary criticism- most notably by delivering the inaugural Turnbull lectures on poetry at the Johns Hopkins University in 1891. The lecture series provided Stedman with the opportunity to offer a corrective to contemporary modes of studying poetry, for "the whole trend of our College policy has been toward scholastic analysis, philology, etc., and scornful of ideality and generalization" (LL, p. 150), and he sought to re-emphasize the role of genius in the study of poetry. While a critic needed to examine "the insensible moulding of an author's life, genius, manner of expression, by the conditions of race, circumstance, and period" (VPoets, p. 1) to understand the poems, the critic also needed to keep in mind that "the song of a nation is accepted as an ultimate test of the popular spirit; as the earliest form of speech and the ripest,- whether the utterance of feelings common to all, or of the fine and daring speculations of the noblest minds."7 Stedman reproduced the Romantic belief that poetry was national speech, but in Stedman's account the relation between a poem and its context was dialectical: the national situation helped to shape the particular features of the poetry, but poems could not simply be reduced down to expressions of the material facts of their context. A critical account of poetry would need to provide for the influence of contextual factors on the creative spirit- in other words, it would need to borrow from both belletristic and philological paradigms. The transatlantic perspective was fundamental to the articulation of national poetic traditions not because American poets borrowed from the British, but because comparable historical-material conditions in the two countries produced similar poetries, and because the genius that characterized the most natural British poetry had emigrated to America. A comparative</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL COHEN/ 169 assessment clarified these first principles, which also explain why Stedman, striving to write about American poetry, felt that he first needed to write about British poetry. I hope to show that Stedman's critical work- the two volumes on British and American nineteenth-century poetry, the theoretical book The Nature and Elements of Poetry (1892), along with the Library of American Literature series (1888-90)- stands at a central point in the emergence of both modern literary criticism and the twentieth- and twenty-first-century understanding of the nineteenth century. In its conceptualization of poetic fields located in but not reducible to national and historical contexts, Stedman's work substantially advanced the discourse of belletristic literary criticism; in his emphasis on national expression and its attendant generic forms, he engaged in a debate with contemporary philological positions on the relation between racial folk- groups and national literary traditions. Yet Stedman cannot comfortably be placed in either discursive domain, and though his work is now most often considered to be an embarrassing articulation of the genteel tradition, I will show how this judgment relies on terms first produced by Stedman himself. His work thus offers an opportunity to assess the synchronic relation between Victorian Britain and Victorian America, and the diachronic relationship between the genteel tradition and modern literary criticism. "It is of great importance to us in England to be observed with affection by that huge and ever-increasing public to which you have so graciously and so ably introduced our poets," Edmund Gosse wrote to Stedman shortly after the publication of Victorian Poets in December 1875. Gosse continued: To myself the hope of recognition in America has always seemed one of the highest objects of ambition. My belief in the future of your nation is unbounded, and I feel convinced that its millions of hardy brains and bodies, so difficult to move in the ways of literature and art, when once moved will progress with irresistible force. To such an end your brilliant volume must actively tend. (LL, p. 16) Gosse's letter reveals that Victorian Poets had benefits for English writers beyond the practical benefit of introducing their work to new customers. The primary benefit was emotional: the book satisfied an English desire for a good recep- tion in America. Poetic transmission did not move in only one direction, of course: during the 1870s and 1880s, American literary periodicals like Harper's and Scribner's began issuing English editions, which brought American poetry into England; by the 1890s, Poultney Bigelow would claim that Harper's "had more circulation ... in England, than any English magazine."8 Claims about national traditions had to be balanced by this international exchange system, which did not so much establish a canon of world literature as it allowed writers to become part of other nations' literary traditions.</page><page sequence="6">170 / VICTORIAN POETRY So it is then that Gosse, and others dissatisfied with the contemporary state of English poetry, could develop an affective stance toward a foreign audience that transcended economic motives and became instead a desire to belong to a different national tradition. The intense interrelation of foreign author and home audience was not a new phenomenon: the major nineteenth- century archetype for this Anglo- American love-affair was Charles Dickens. Yet if the adoption of Dickens by American readers in the 1830s and 1840s signaled the degree to which national literary traditions involved international exchanges, Dickens' own involvement in the exchange foreshadowed the Victorian American resistance to internationalism in the name of national literature. The key issue, both in the early and late Victorian period, was copy- right: Dickens used his 1842 American tour, in which he was wildly celebrated (as American heroes like Washington never had been, at least according to disapproving elements in the American news-media),9 partly to campaign for an international copyright law. Dickens may have desired an American readership, but he wanted it on standard market terms; whatever affective need he might feel for an American audience, he wanted to get paid too.10 His speeches on the subject in Boston, Hartford, and New York prompted an intense anti-English reaction from the American news and periodical media, which had profitably been reprinting his and other foreign writers' work since the late 1830s. In a letter to Jonathan Chapman, Dickens declared himself "the greatest loser by the existing law, alive," but even so he claimed "disin- terestedness" in his advocacy of an international copyright law.11 Regardless of whatever truth may have existed in his claims about copyright and despite John Forster's claim in the Foreign Quarterly (in an article vindicating Dickens and disparaging American newspapers) that the American copyright law would forever prevent America from having a national literature, the American media attacked Dickens precisely for his "pecuniary considerations," which they saw as his lone motive in raising the issue.12 When Stedman took part in an American campaign for international copyright protection later in the nineteenth century, he more explicitly con- nected the copyright question with its implications for a national American poetry: "Until a state of law shall exist that will induce American publishers, driven from their distant for aging-grounds, to seek for genius at home and make it available, the support of our authors will not be so assured as to tend 'in the end to the advancement of literature'" (PA, p. 24). A work like Poets of America might advance the development of American poetry by sparking public interest in the poets both at home and abroad, but this effect needed to be bolstered by legal support. Stedman's interest was not exactly Dickens': Dickens argued the liberal position of protecting personal property; Stedman argued the nativist position o{ protecting the national tradition. Protecting literary property enabled poets to keep on working, but this was never to be an end in</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL COHEN / 171 itself: the poetry had to support and advance a national literary tradition that expressed the true spirit of the nation and conversed actively with history. The conclusion of Victorian Poets harshly critiques contemporary British poetry for its failure to engage with the historical situation of the lateA/ictorian British Empire, a failure that effectively deracinated English poetry: The desire of the critic and the public alike ... is for something new and additional. But that which is new is of higher worth when it contributes to the furtherance of a true national style. What is Spanish, French, German, we at once recognize as such, however different from previous works of like origin; but how seldom the later Victorian minstrelsy is essentially English! ... [A] national manner has distinguished the most subtle and inclusive of literary forms in every important era. This is not sustained by curious devices and imitations, however choice and attractive, but by harmonizing personal quality with the national note of expression. I think there is a lack of recognizable and pervasive style in our English poetry of the period. . . . [I]t is chiefly English in its intense desire to escape from Anglicism. . . . The new men withdraw themselves from the movement of their time and country, forgetting it all in dreamland- in no-man's-land. . . . The grand old realm bids fair to have her awakening. There are clouds enough to bode sterner issues and nearer conflicts than she has faced since Cromwell's time. Ireland is filling men's ears with her threats and appeals. In a season of jubilee socialists crowd St. Paul's, their banners inscribed with "Jus- tice and Liberty, or Death"; the Marseillaise is chorused in London thoroughfares, and London poets sing- triolets. (VPoets, pp. 480-483) No amount of legal protection could improve this sort of situation. English poetry of the "decadent" period is not bad merely because it violates formal norms (placing "decoration" before "expression," for example)- it displays its weakness by being unable to live up to the demands of its histori- cal moment. By withdrawing from history, poetry withdraws from national traditions into a "no-man's-land" of irrelevance, at which point it loses pride of place in the hierarchy of genres. This fate is precisely what he wishes American poetry to avoid. He considered his Johns Hopkins lectures as an opportunity to reinvigorate poetry as "the voice of the future" at a time when "poetry as the utterance of feeling and imagination is strenuously rivaled by other forms of expression, especially by the modern industry of prose fiction."13 Making poetry the voice of the American people would require a return to the ideal of personal expression, which would, paradoxically, insure that the expression was American as well: "Unless the feeling of our home-poet be novel, his vi-</page><page sequence="8">172 / VICTORIAN POETRY sion a fresh and distinctive vision,- unless these are radically different from the French, or German, or even the English feeling and vision,- they are not American, and our time has not yet come" (PA, p. 5). Stedman's emphasis on transatlanticism was not, or not entirely, motivated by cosmopolitan or universalist principles, let alone Anglophilia: the volumes instead produced a more pluralistic vision of world literature. Any poet's work must be an act of personal creative expression; to be great, however, the poetry must also express the major traits of the national tradition in which it participates. The difficulty in establishing a fully American literary tradition had been due to the fact "that a distinction between the conditions of England and America was not more strongly established. Since the war our novitiate has ended. We welcome home-productions; our servility to foreign judgment has lessened, and we apply with considerable self poise our own standards of criticism to things abroad" (PA, p. 473). In the future, American poets' greatness will come from the "illusive something which renders their productions American" (PA, p. 456). Americanist criticism has attempted to define that "illusive something" for a long time. If, for Stedman, national literary identities were the expres- sion of the people, this did not mean that national literature had simply to participate in the nation's folk culture by, for example, adopting the legends of a particular place. Rather, true national poetry should speak to and for the people, and its failure to do so in the late decades of the nineteenth century accounted for poetry's tenuous place in the hierarchy of genres. The problem in contemporary Victorian poetry may have been its withdrawal from the historical-material conditions of Victorian Britain, but in America the problem was poetry's failure to connect consistently with the American people. American poetry might be "more charged with national sentiment than that of the late English poets" (PA, p. 456), but since "the people care little for current poetry," the critic decides that "poetry cares little for the people" (PA, p. 465). 14 But this conclusion largely sidesteps a more interesting problem: might the disconnect separating the poets of America from the American people result from the failure of the American people to unify as a coherent type? In one early passage in Poets of America- worth quoting at length- Stedman suggests this possibility: A broadly national character is plainly incomplete, and has wide room for maturer development. ... A restless and ill-adjusted spirit still pervades the heterogeneous elements of our nationality. Here is a country as large as all Europe, embracing zones as far apart, in physi- cal attributes, as those of Norway and Sicily. Here are the emigrants or descendants of every people in Europe,- to go no farther,- and all</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL COHEN/ 173 their languages, and customs, and traditions, and modes of feeling, at one time or another, have come with them. Hence our unconscious habitude of variety, the disinclination to cling to one way of life or thought until its perfect conclusion. There is a ferment in new blood. . . . America has absorbed the traits of many lands and people; the currents still set this way; our modern intercourse with the world at large is close and unintermitting, so that the raw ingredients of our national admixture are supplied quite as rapidly as the whirl and stir of the popular system can triturate and commingle them. It is too much, then, to expect that our art or song, from whatever section either may come, will exhibit a quality specifically American in the sense that the product of Italy is Italian, or that of France is French. (PA, pp. 7-8) Though Stedman sometimes endorses the "Anglo-Saxons" as the "master race" or the "dominant type" in America, he undercuts these endorsements with passages like the above. Stedman's equivocation about American racial identity marks a strong contrast to other Victorian poetic theorists like Sidney Lanier, for whom the "Saxonism" of the English language provided a stable racial identity.15 For Stedman, the endless heterogeneity of the American people makes it impossible for any one poem to express the illusive something that is American: no poem can be fully American because, at present, no one tradition can fully embrace all Americans, or, more radically, because no American is yet fully American. Thus the nativist logic underlying Stedman's advocacy of international copyright law is elaborated in fantasies of internal colonization that will make a uniform American tradition by making first a uniform American people. If Stedman only periodically endorses "the Saxon" as the native American type, he does consistently employ the ideology inher- ent to "Anglo-Saxon ism" in the later nineteenth century. According to John Higham, Anglo-Saxonist race thinkers held "a happy belief that the Anglo- Saxon has a marvelous capacity for assimilating kindred races, absorbing their valuable qualities, yet remaining basically unchanged."16 Stedman's literary nativism could express a positive belief in American identity when rooting that identity in a specifically "Yankee" (rather than simply "Saxon") racial type, but this rootedness remained incomplete amidst the economic and racial unrest of the post-Reconstruction era. Thus the desire for a national literary tradition is, in Poets of America, underwritten by a racial fantasy of an expansive, colonizing Yankee folk moving out across America to unify the country by "Yankeefying" it: The New Englanders [seem] almost a race by themselves. . . . This hive of individuality has sent out swarms, and scattered its ideas like pollen throughout the northern belt of our States. As far as these have taken</page><page sequence="10">174 / VICTORIAN POETRY hold, modified by change and experience, New England stands for the nation. (PA, pp. 98-99) Yet although Stedman endorses this fantasy of consolidating the Ameri- can race hy way of synecdoche, he admits that "whether such a faith is well grounded is still an open question," which leads him to ask whether there has "been a time, as yet, when any writer could be thoroughly American?" (PA, p. 96). The nativist fantasy of a distinctive American race must exist for there to be any possibility of an American literary tradition, but Stedman consistently calls into question the grounds for believing in this fantasy and, by extension, that tradition. The only solution he offers will be to emulate a foreign example, a gesture that repeats the transatlantic exchange that initiated the national poetic project- look back to Britain: More clearly to understand how far, and in what way, our poets have felt the lack of background, of social contrasts, and of legendary and specific incident, we may observe the literature of some region where different conditions exist. In an isolated country of established growth and quality, a native genius soon discovers his tendency and proper field. Look at Scotland. Her national melodies were ready and waiting for Burns; her legends, history, traditions, for Walter Scott. The popular tongue, costumes, manners, all distinctively and picturesquely her own, affect the entire outcome of her song and art. Embraced in English literature, her literature is so un-English that it affords the paradigm we need. (PA, pp. 21-22) Scotland provides a hopeful example of a people able to consolidate itself within a more generally heterogeneous nation, but Scotland has pre- cisely those "national melodies" that America needs; the paradigm cannot be applicable until some set of stable American songs becomes available. As the Scottish model indicates, the absence of political institutions necessitates that the "national melodies . . . legends, history, traditions" in themselves constitute Scotland, which is to say that they shift from representing Scotland or expressing Scotland's voice to embodying, to being Scotland. In advocat- ing the Scottish model, Stedman urges not only the example of a people able to maintain their identity, but also and more importantly he underlines the need for national melodies that can produce a people, who will then go on to create a national poetic tradition. The fantasy of poems being nations, the idea that "the United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem" is, most famously, Whitman's.17 Among Victorian American writers on poetry, Whitman and Stedman most strongly articulated the desire to make poems and nations equivalent. Stedman</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL COHEN/ 175 clearly recognized the sympathy that existed between the two of them: when the first seven volumes of the Library of American Literature were published in 1889, Stedman sent Whitman a complimentary set, saying that "you of all men will take in, comprehend, the purpose, the meaning, of this long com- pilation. You will justly estimate its significance, and this quite irrespectively of its literary or artistic qualities. There are masterpieces in it. But it is not a collection of masterpieces: it is something of more moment to you and me. It is America" (LL, p. 121; emphasis in text). Stedman's poetics have become decidedly more Whitmanian: from the effort to define the illusive something that makes poems American, Stedman has come to imagine a poetry that is American regardless of the intention or identity of the people who write and read it. The poems are America, and a person becomes American by buying into this American poetic tradition. (The great irony is that so few people actually bought the Library of American Literature that it bankrupted two dif- ferent publishing houses.) Genre is the key to this metonymic substitution- poem for nation- in both the early Scottish example and the later, hoped-for American re-instantia- tion. The major violation of bad contemporary poets according to Stedman is formal: they increasingly turned away from the forms that best express the people, choosing instead forms that merely express poetic over-refinement. The people's genre, the genre that will set in motion the process of creating a national poetry, is the ballad. Stedman's use of ballads as the key genre for poetic nationalism further explains why, in Poets of America, he makes Whittier the primary American poet (a judgment that must otherwise seem hopelessly genteel to contemporary readers). As we shall see, Stedman takes Whittier as the poet who most directly speaks for the Yankee race, the race which, in the nativist fantasy that drives Poets of America, will absorb the heterogeneous cultural traditions at play in America and condense them into the distinctive American racial type. Whittier thus functions as the proto-American poet. In language more specific to the project, though, Stedman goes on to explain that "of all our poets he is the most natural balladist" (PA, p. 112), and thus Whittier "in this land, is a truer type of the people's poet[;] . . . [the] folk have an instinct that Whittier, for example, has seized his day . . . and has sung songs 'fit for the New World' as he found it" (PA, p. 385). It is through his ballads that Whittier speaks for his people, and Stedman solidifies the connection between the nascent American folk and the generic poetic form through their mutual elision in Whittier.18 To think of ballads in this way at this time was to participate in a rich discourse that was articulating new disciplinary domains, like literary study, and also debating controversial ideas of cultural, racial, and social history. According to Tom Cheesman and Sigrid Rieuwerts, in the nineteenth century "ballad studies emerged as an important site of a many-faceted debate: about</page><page sequence="12">176 / VICTORIAN POETRY the interrelatedness of cultural past, present and future; about real and ideal cultures; about local and national, transnational and universal cultures."19 The American discourse on balladry had settled on what the Harvard professor Francis James Child termed "the popular ballad," a form he defined as "a truly national or popular poetry" that arose in social conditions where "the people are not divided by political organization or book culture into markedly distinct classes, in which consequently there is such community of ideas and feelings that the whole people form an individual"20 Though ballads were "an expression of our common human nature," they were also "differenced by circumstances and idiosyncrasy" (Child, p. 214). Ballads thus provided a unique window into the history and spirit of a particular people, and ballad collections offered the best source for learning that history and defining that spirit, because authentic popular ballads connected back to social groups that were coherent and distinguishable in their specificity. As Michael J. Bell has argued, Child meant to differentiate his "popular" ballad from the older nineteenth-century "folk" ballad (and the recently coined term "folklore") on the basis of the type of population understood to have produced the poetry. If "folk" "defined a far more encompassing historical community and a far more intense idea of social ties," Child's "popular" referred to "social communities of the recent past . . . [who] derive their unity from the bonds of faith and feudal law."21 While popular ballads are "national" in their expression, they predate the development of modern nation-states; yet their cohering in feudal times also places them inside history, potentially within reach of modern times and modern scholarship. Child's historicism thus made the popular ballad applicable to America. America might not have its own distinct "folk," but it could have a connec- tion to the "people" who had created English-language ballads (see Bell, p. 299). In 1882, while Stedman was publishing in Scribner's the essays that would form Poets of America, Child published the first installment (of ten) of The English and Scottish Popular Ballads. Child intended this anthology "to include every obtainable version of every extant English or Scottish ballad" in its purest or most authentically popular form, to function as a resource of the "'popular' genius . . . [and] the traits that characterize oral literature," and to rigorously exclude all traces of "the forger and the manipulator."22 Consequently the anthology would provide American readers with a sense of unmediated connection to a pre-national past, and with its basis in Child's Utopian definition of the popular ballad, the collection could also function as a paradigm for the sort of national poetry Stedman desired for America and sought in Whittier. Because the popular ballad assumed the existence of a coherent people, it offered the perfect generic solution to the problems besetting American poetry and American social and cultural life. Child's agenda, and the particular contribution he made to the discourse of ballad</page><page sequence="13">MICHAEL COHEN/ 177 study, was "to rescue from oblivion . . . evidence of the cultural childhood of the American community, in order to suggest a path towards achieving an ideal cultural unity in the newly United States" (Cheesman and Rieuwerts, p. 10), a purpose nearly identical to Stedman's. But asserting this point only emphasizes the stark differences in the work that Stedman and Child produced. And, if Stedman may be (and generally is) taken as an emblematic figure of the genteel tradition of American literature, Child may (and should) be taken as an emblematic figure in the emergent academic tradition of American literature. In fact Child's career neatly encapsulates the discursive formation of English studies as a discipline: after graduating from Harvard in 1849, he studied Germanic philology in Berlin and Gottingen, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1854 (although he had completed only one semester there), making him the first American so honored. At Harvard he served as Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory until 1876, when he was named the first Professor of English. In addition to the ballad collection, he edited the first scholarly editions of Chaucer and Spenser in America.23 His work shifted the object of study from the historical transformation of languages (the domain of philology) to the literary texts that had initially provided examples of those transformations, in this way exemplifying the story Graff and Warner tell of the shift in America from philology to English studies. Ballad study had been an important part of English literary and cultural thought since Thomas Percy's publication of Reliques of Ancient English Poetry in 1765, but it had remained an antiquarian domain of study until philolo- gists like Goethe and Herder in Germany and Svend Grundtvig in Denmark took it up in the early nineteenth century. These philologists, more so even than Walter Scott (whose work on Scottish minstrelsy somewhat preceded them), saw ballads as a form of living tradition,24 which made them particu- larly expressive of the many national identities that were under construction in early nineteenth-century Europe.25 Child and Stedman sought to produce this Romanticist discourse in America. If Child's work is more theoretically and editorially rigorous, Stedman's work more overtly thematizes the poetic prehistory that has, he hopes, led to a present moment when a fully American poetic tradition can begin to circulate in the system of world literatures. As the passages on Whittier demonstrate, Stedman accepts philology's connec- tion of ballads with folk expression and posits the Yankee folk as the proto- American race, but because the fantasy of a Yankee race can only partially solve the problem of American heterogeneity, Whittier's ballads can only partially act as America's national melodies: they require the synecdoche of Yankee-for-American, and so they cannot in themselves produce the metonymy of poem-for-nation. Therefore Stedman shifts his allegiance to a more gen- eral model of literary nationalism, one that ignores generic particularity and</page><page sequence="14">178 / VICTORIAN POETRY aesthetic distinction in favor of a totalized metonymic designation: this shift allows him to claim the Library of American Literature as "not a collection of masterpieces" but "America." At the conclusion of Poets of America he pushes this general poetic-national link to its furthest limits: "As we make conjecture of the future of American song . . . who can doubt that it will correspond to the future of the land itself- of America now wholly free and interblending" (PA, p. 476). The future of American poetry- in fact the only way it will have a future- is to remain interchangeable and coequal with the land and the people abstracted in the word "America" and the urgent goal of the moment is to produce a genre that can maintain this relationship. The generic specificity ignored in the prehistory of American literature returns in the intense effort to imagine a future for American poetry. Stedman's work thus differed from the recent discourse of literary racial- ism (exemplified in the linguistic anthropology of a writer like Lanier), and also from the contemporary belletristic discourse which, in (for instance) the work of Horace Scudder, sought to consolidate "American literature" into a small canon of writers simply (though not arbitrarily) by naming these writers as American.26 Beginning in the 1870s and continuing for a generation, Boston belletristic institutions like the Atlantic Monthly and the Riverside Press began instantiating the "Fireside Poets" as the major American literary tradition by printing out numerous biographies, anthologies, and textbooks that central- ized these writers under the rubric of American literature. The pedagogical function of such texts was to present the literature of certain New England writers as American literature, which has lead contemporary critics to argue (convincingly, I think) that the normative intent of the Fireside industry was to deploy this literature in an effort to assimilate the increasingly multi-ethnic population of the American schools.27 But, again, this project was not Sted- man's. Genteel progressives (and their twentieth-century successors) desired poems that expressed America or American values, and they consciously chose certain literary texts as expressive of America in order to limit the definition of what constituted American literature (and therefore American people as well). A person could write American poems (or become American) only by emulating or internalizing the values expressed by the tradition of the Fireside poets. Stedman, in contrast, sought to make America the product of a certain kind of poetry, which thereby made choosing American poems impossible, since a desire for America would always already entail a commitment to this poetry. American poems thus produced rather than expressed American people, so that people could not emulate or adopt these poems, since the poems constituted the grounds of the people's existence in the first place. But because such poems- tantalizingly exemplified in the "national melodies" of Scotland- seemed to be forever out of reach given the facts of the American political situation, Stedman's defense of the possibility of an American litera-</page><page sequence="15">MICHAEL COHEN/ 179 ture settled on a genre-based theory that understood American institutions as existing in dialectical relation to American poetry rather than taking either as a stable ground of American identity in its own right. In the introduction to The Nature and Elements of Poetry, the published edition of his Turnbull lectures at Johns Hopkins, Stedman defined poetry as "a specific manifestation of that all-pervading force, of which each one possesses a share at his control, and which communicates the feeling and thought of the human soul to its fellows." If this assertion seems like pale genteel effusing, Stedman intended, in fact, to cut through this sort of lan- guage by way of an "applied criticism" that would demand "the sincere and even ascetic mood that wishes no illusions and demands a working basis." Such sincerity and asceticism demand that the critic understand poetic form as an extension of the material history surrounding it; rather than imagining form as existing outside of time (or in opposition to it), the critic must read form as the highest index of time and history: Expression is the avowed function of all the arts, their excuse for being; out of the need for it, art in the rude and primitive forms has ever sprung. ... At the same time, the [poet] cannot invent forms and methods and symbols out of keeping with what we term the nature of things; such inventions, if possible, would be monstrous, baleful, not to be endured. (NEP, pp. 4445) Genre and history are linked in this formulation, and the dialectical progression of one coincides with the dialectical progression of the other in standard Hegelian fashion- "objective" forms like epics and ballads give way to "subjective" forms like lyrics and dramas as a race becomes more self-conscious and as a nation achieves full internal coherence. The "objective masterpieces . . . are so naturally inwrought with history and popular traits that they seem growths rather than works of art" (NEP, p. 78). Such masterpieces ("the Indian epics, the Northern sagas, the early ballads of all nations, and of course the Homeric poems of Greece") embody a people because they come into exis- tence prior to history, before that people understand themselves as a people. When the dialectical progression has advanced the people into a nation with an historical self-consciousness, these early objective works function as the indices that maintain the distinctive identity of the people who constitute the nation. The early literary tradition thus enables a people to remain a people and allows a nation to continue as a nation. The subjective poetry of later periods must work to continue the identity embodied in the early literature. These later works will need to contend with the historical and material forces of their own time, but they will only have lasting value if they maintain the prehistorical identity of the nation embodied in the early literature. "It seems, then, I say, the lot of each nation, as if an individual, and of each period, as if a</page><page sequence="16">180 / VICTORIAN POETRY modish season, to discover the beauty conformed both to the general laws and to specific needs and impulse; to create, moreover, its proper forms in every art, thus making new contributions to the world's thesaurus of poetry and design" (NEP, p. 164). And because material circumstances, such as national institutions like democracy, affect poetic production, the value of institutions will be determined by the poetry with which they coincide: In the Old World [poetic production] has been accomplished through the instrumentality of central governments. In a democracy the indi- vidual imagination has the liberty, the duty, of free play and achieve- ment. Therefore, we say that in this matter our republicanism is on trial; that, with a forecast more exultant, as it is with respect to our own future, than that of any people on earth, our theory is wrong un- less through private impulse American foundations in art, learning, humanity, are not even more continuous and munificent than those resulting in other countries from governmental promotion. (NEP, p. 229) Far from seeing democracy or liberty as the ground of American identity that great American literature must express in order to be great American literature (as F. O. Matthiessen might argue), Stedman makes such institutions subsequent to an America grounded in literary genres (most prominently the ballad) that exist apart from historical manifestations like democratic govern- ment. And not only do such historical manifestations not embody America, Stedman implies that they should be discarded if they cannot soon produce a poetry able to continue American identity. Of course, the constitution of American identity has been a fraught subject throughout Stedman's work- first it is a continuation of an Anglo-Saxon identity that begins in England (in Victorian Poets); later it is based on the Yankee folk, distinct from English an- cestry yet only in the process of unifying the many regional sub-types found in America; later still Stedman models the American identity on the Scottish example, but since America must first discover national melodies like those that embody and enable Scottish identity, Stedman finally locates American identity- or more specifically, America- in literary genres. The Hegelian his- toricism of The Nature and Elements of Poetry thus allows Stedman to produce both an American identity and an American literature in one critical treatise, and it also explains the urgency with which he argues for a new, vital poetic spirit in America, since without a new era of vital national poetry, America itself becomes a tentative phenomenon. Critics of the genteel tradition are therefore wrong to see late-nineteenth- century poetics as solely a defense of bourgeois domestic mores. While it is true that Stedman disliked the dirty parts of Leaves of Grass and encouraged</page><page sequence="17">MICHAEL COHEN/ 181 Whitman to publish an expurgated edition (which Whitman did),28 his critical work was not concerned with defending the values of genteel decency. The values Stedman advocated were "imagination" and "expression," and, as I have argued, he asserted these values in the service of a nationalistic literary tradi- tion that saw America and American poetry as the same. This program was not defensive in the sense that it did not urge normative literary values for the sake of shoring up normative cultural values. Rather, it was productive in the sense that it urged the creation of American poetry according to a paradigm that emphasized genres like the ballad. According to the theoretical program underwriting Stedman's paradigm, the focus on key poetic genres would call into being both an American people and an American nation. In this light, Stedman seems to have pre-empted the principle thesis of anti-genteel criticism. The major focus of such criticism is not genteel culture's sentimentalism or consumerism, but the schizophrenic split between American ideals (literary, religious, etc.) and the reality of everyday life in America (economic competition, political corruption, etc.) that begins during the Victorian era. Critiques grounded in an analysis of this bifurcation of culture into genteel ideals and pragmatic reality run through twentieth-century polemics against the nineteenth century, beginning with George Santayana, and including Van Wyck Brooks, V. L. Parrington, Perry Miller, Ann Doug- las, T. J. Jackson Lears, and the contributors to the latest Cambridge History of American Literature. This critical tradition (which can of course be modified to include, for instance, critiques of the evasion of race in American liter- ary history like those by Toni Morrison or Eric Sundquist) forms one major strand of twentieth-century Americanist criticism.29 The striking point is not that these polemical accounts of Victorian American culture are wrong, but that they replicate Stedman's own major anxieties. One of Stedman's major desires in his critical work was to keep poetry as a driving force in American culture. In the face of a mounting consumerism- which he sometimes calls "science" and sometimes "material progress"- and an American public that seemed to him increasingly uninterested in poetry, Stedman searches for a "usable past" (in Brooks's words) that will vitalize an American literary tradi- tion and prevent the splits within culture that later critics deplore. We can see how Stedman anticipates later anti-Victorian criticism if we compare his argument with Ann Douglas' account, which is particularly inter- esting since it replicates so many of Stedman's concerns. According to Douglas, American culture was based on the "self-evasion of a society both committed to laissez-faire industrial expansion and disturbed by its consequences," and, because it was "younger and less formed than that of any European country," Victorian American culture "had not yet developed sufficiently rich and diver- sified secular traditions to serve as carriers for its ongoing intellectual life."30 Douglas attacks nineteenth-century culture for its failure to come to terms</page><page sequence="18">182 / VICTORIAN POETRY with the Puritan theological heritage of seventeenth- and eighteentlvcentury New England, a failure that, among other things, disabled "the transfer of energy formerly assigned to theological tasks into the service of history" (F, p. 175) begun by antebellum historians like Jared Sparks and George Bancroft. Such historicism "constituted an undisputedly serious effort toward American self-realization" at a time when "rapid and apparently promising intellectual, economic, and social development necessitated the at least partial adoption of historicism" (F, p. 180). But the self evasion of Victorian America blocked this historicist self realization and produced in its stead a genre of "clerical-feminine biography" that replaced the "grand view of Hegelian intellectual history" with a "psychological topography of [the] era" (F, p. 189). The result was that "as a genre . . . the clerical-feminine biographies . . . [used] the biographical form as [a] calculatedly therapeutic indulgence in the experience of ordinary human personality" (F, pp. 189-190). In the culture of Victorian America, the articulation of a national self-consciousness, heralded in the Hegelian historicism of the antebellum historians, lost out to the palliative comforts of the sentimental ideology endorsed in the clerical-feminine biographies. The defeat happens on the level of genre: the serious genre- history- loses to the non-serious or popular genre. Structurally Douglas' critique repeats Stedman's, since he also deplored the replacement of good, national poetic genres with bad, artificial ones. For both Douglas and Stedman, this sort of generic defeat made American culture a tenuous proposition. The structural similarity also highlights the specific differences in the generic struggle that Douglas and Stedman focus on. In The Feminization of American Culture, the debate is entirely between prose genres. By replacing theology and history with the sentimental novel and the clerical-feminine bi- ography, America loses its political and historical consciousness and becomes little more than bourgeois marketing enterprise; Victorian American culture is "a tragic dead-end" (F, p. 253), and only those (prose) writers (Melville, Fuller) who "rebel" against middle-class culture are of value today. The benefit of pairing Douglas' version with Stedman's is not only to show that Victorian America did make a "serious effort toward American self-realization," but also to show how in the nineteenth century such an effort came through the production of an American literary tradition based on poetic genres, while in the twentieth century the same effort (to produce a usable American past) must, almost by definition, be dominated by prose genres. "By definition," since "poetic genre" conjures up notions of formal conventionalism that are, in their most benign twentieth-century iterations, imagined as non-American and thoroughly domesticated; "almost" since, of course, there are at least two notable exceptions to the prose domination of the American canon. But the canonicity of these poets has also long depended, at least within the anti- genteel tradition, on their rebelliousness against popular culture and poetic</page><page sequence="19">MICHAEL COHEN / 183 form. This rebelliousness accommodates these poets to the twentieth-century norms that mark an author's status as canonically American: Whitman's break with form in the chants and catalogues of the 1855 Leaves of Grass makes him the democratic leveler; Dickinson, in the increasingly lyricized or unedited manifestations that have marked the twentieth-century history of her poems, becomes one of the great antinomians. For the anti-genteel critics, poetic individualism equals a hostility to genre. Great American poetry must there- fore be "novelistic" in Bakhtin's sense of "three-dimensionality" and formal "openendedness."31 But this resistance to genre is not in any sense an escape from genre: Whitman and Dickinson must be read a certain way- that is, read according to a certain set of norms- to highlight the distinctively American features of their poems. The normative intent of anti-genteel writers still conflates Americanness and genre, only "genre" in the anti-genteel critique has largely lost any specific content and often means nothing more than high or serious literature (as opposed to popular or sentimental literature) or even simply "literature" as such.32 The anti-genteel tradition thus replicates the genteel tradition's association of genre with national identity even as it assumes itself to be repudiating the genteel. While a return to Stedman's criticism makes clear the connection be- tween genteel and anti-genteel discourse, this does not mean that the genteel tradition simply authorizes the terms of its later repudiation. The two tradi- tions are not, after all, the same, and one important difference is that genteel writing grounded its claims about literature and national literary traditions in an historical theorization of poetic genres, while the anti-genteel tradition, by and large, has emphasized either prose genres or novelistic poetics. Stedman's work defined literary criticism as a distinct domain of study by taking poems as objects of great cultural power. This power was the ability to bring races and nations into being by providing them with a shared expressive consciousness, and it resided in exemplary poetic genres like the ballad. Stedman's poetics thus offers a counterstatement to contemporary critical unease about poetry and poetic genres. This unease has received its most rigorous articulation in Paul de Man's poetics, with its premise that "generic terms ... as well as pseudo-historical period terms ... are always terms of resistance and nostalgia, at the furthest remove from the materiality of actual history."33 In "Anthro- pomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," de Man's profound skepticism about critical discourse emerges out of a project that takes aim at the "uncertain status of the lyric as a term for poetic discourse in general" by interrogating "the structure of the tropes on which the claim to lyricism depends" (RR, p. 254), namely the anthropomorphic attribution of voice as subject. This tropological act must be the opening move in any further claim to knowledge: "the union of aesthetic with epistemological properties," de Man argues, "is carried out by the mediation of the metaphor of the self as consciousness of itself (RR,</page><page sequence="20">184 / VICTORIAN POETRY p. 256). Revealing this false naturalization leads to the conclusion that "the lyric is not a genre, but one name among several to designate the defensive motion of understanding" (RR, p. 261). The problem, which provides the impetus for de Man's hermeneutics, is that claims for poetic language- and, following the example of Nietzsche, truth and knowledge more generally- have come to rely un-self-consciously on a naturalized sense of the lyric subject. This mistake allows "the aesthetic ideologization of linguistic structures" to act as though it were "an empirical historical event" (RR, p. 253), an illustration of the proposition that "tropes are the producers of ideologies that are no longer true" (RRy p. 242). The asceticism of de Man's poetics demands some alternative to the false referentiality or ideology (the "fallacious lyrical reading of the unintelligible") that constitutes poetic language, an alternative de Man characterizes as "historical modes of language power" (RR^ p. 262). Stedman provides an alternative to de Man's poetics by providing a non-lyrical reading practice for poetry, one based on a notion of historically forceful poetic genres that are something more than theoretical (or false) constructs. This non-lyrical reading practice makes poems and poetic tradi- tions dialectical entities, never totally immanent to their context and yet not transcendent of it either. As such, it gives genre a potent relation to human life. This understanding of poetic genres as functional, historical agents may prove to be the most shocking characteristic of genteel literary criticism, far more so than any perceived sense of its sentimentalism or conventionality. To Stedman, the purpose of literary criticism was to provide a system of analysis that could describe the historical products of this generic power, and also prescribe its uses for the future- a normative, which is to say a nationalistic or even nativistic intent, one far different from that most often aligned with the genteel tradition. Stedman's ambivalence about the discourse he helped create came from the fear that literary criticism would be deprived of this normative purpose, and given over simply to debates among pedants. By giving literary criticism both a purpose and an analytical approach, Stedman enabled twentieth-century Americanist critics to dismantle the nineteenth century in a search for a more usable past. Much has been obscured in this search: the genteel origins of modern literary study; the transatlantic rela- tionship that formed the national fields of Victorian British and American poetry; and most importantly the multiform cultural role of poetic genres in the creation of national, racial, historical, and literary traditions. This obscu- ration, which can also be known as the lyricization of genre, could help to explain the malaise so often associated with the discursive (if not pedantic, but most certainly normative) debates of modern literary study, a malaise that has much to do with literary study's imagined sense of its own history as a discourse. Re-examining the origins of literary study, national literary</page><page sequence="21">MICHAEL COHEN/ 185 traditions, and poetic discourse may not provide answers to contemporary critical problems- whither Victorian poetry? does literature matter? is theory dead?- but it will reveal that such problems were built into the very history of literary criticism as a discipline. In consequence, the genteel tradition may come to herald the future of American literary criticism, and Stedman to seem like the newest Americanist critic.

Though he links the development of the term with late-nine- teenth-century theories about post- 183 2 British poetry and though he gives attention to Stedman's Victorian Poets as the first major treatise to use the term, Bristow does not examine the transatlantic implications of this innovation.

Hereafter abbreviate NEP and cited in the text. 14 In this context it is interesting to contrast Stedman's nineteenth-century critique with the "popular" poetry and genteel poetics of the early twentieth century. Accord- ing to Joseph Harrington, "in the 1910s the pervasiveness of ... traditional poetics accompanied large-scale movements for social reforms and a struggle over the mean- ing of democracy. In 1914 one writer in the Independent explained, 'The reason why people are taking more interest in poetry is because poetry is taking more interest in people'" (pp. 498-499). Harrington explains that this shared commitment to poetry as "an immaterial influence that uses the text as a sort of conduit to the people" (p. 500; emphasis added) linked genteel poets like Joyce Kilmer with radical poets like Max Eastman. Despite the striking similarity between Stedman's comment and the later Independent critic's comment, we should remember that the key difference between the two models of popular poetry (a poetry that interests and is interested in the people) is that the twentieth-century model is essentially thematic- any poem, whether it concerns the beauty of a tree or the struggles of the working poor, will uplift its readers- while Stedman's model is much more emphatically generic- a triolet on the Irish question is no good; a ballad on the gag rules is. See Joseph Harrington, "Why American Poetry is not American Literature," American Literary History 8, no. 3 (Autumn 1996): 496- 515. 15 Lanier's major poetic treatise is The Science of English Verse (1879), which connected the English language with the Saxon race on the basis of poetic meter. Any line of English poetry written in "3-rhythm" was Saxon (and not English, American, Canadian, etc.), regardless of the identity or intention of its author; conversely, a Saxon author could not help but write poetry in 3-rhythm.

I agree that the effort to pro- duce national identities is primarily a literary effort, but I believe that it occurs in the discourse on poetic genres like ballads, while Trumpener (despite relying heavily on Macpherson) focuses almost entirely on prose genres like the historical novel. See Katie Trumpener, Bardic Nationalism (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1997). 26 Scudder summarized his project in the preface to Masterpieces of American Literature (1891; Freeport: Books for Libraries Press, 1970): "This volume owes its existence to the desire of the Boston school authorities for a collection of productions from American authors of distinction, especially suitable for use in the most advanced class of the grammar schools," p. iii. 27 See, for instance, Nina Baym, "Early Histories of American Literature: A Chapter in the Institution of New England," American Literary History 1, no. 3 (Autumn 1989): 459-488, and Leonard Lutwack, "The New England Hierarchy," The New England Quarterly 28, no. 2 0une 1955): 164-185. Both of these accounts are mainly historical descriptions of the process; their explanatory model tends largely toward the "genteel cabal" theory that we encountered with DuBois and Lentricchia, and therefore the literary future they predict is a similar modernist liberation of American literature from nineteenth-century tyranny. 28 See Ed Folsom, "Leaves of Grass Junior: Whitman's Compromise with Discriminat- ing Taste," American Literature 63, no. 4 (December 1991): 641-663. The editor of the expurgated Leaves of Grass was Stedman's son Arthur. 29 There are, of course, other ways of talking about nineteenth-century culture: see, for instance, Jane Tompkins, Sensational Designs (Durham: Duke Univ. Press, 1984), and Walter Benn Michaels, The Gold Standard and the Logic of Naturalism (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1987). The interesting point for my purpose is that counter-arguments for the nineteenth century are grounded in prose fiction and ignore poetry, which belies the historical centrality of poetic genres in the formation of American literature and American literary culture. Paula Bennett's Poets in the Public Sphere (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 2003) provides one recent exception to this tendency. 30 Ann Douglas, TKe Feminization of American Culture (New York: Farrar, Strauss and</page><page sequence="24">188 / VICTORIAN POETRY Giroux, 1998), p. 12.

Donald Pease would probably be unhappy to learn that Stedman early on refers to his own critical project as "the New Americanism" (PA, p. 10) because it works toward a more expansive and less localized idea of American literature. So long as revisionary interventions into the Americanist canon continue to exclude poetic genres, they will not be new- they will not even be genteel. 33 Paul de Man, The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia Univ.
