<plain_text><page sequence="1">Illicit Pleasures: Dante Among the Sensualists (Purgatorio XXVI) Richard Abrams Arriving on the seventh terrace of Mt. Purgatory, the pilgrim keeps to the edge where a cliffside draft curls back the flames, creating walking-space. Mindful of double peril he anxiously divides his glance between the fire and the precipice and notices an odd op- tical phenomenon. It is late afternoon, the sun low in the sky. But while elsewhere along the ledge the daylight bleaches the fire col- orless, where Dante walks he casts a shadow, darkening the flames which therefore glow a deeper red. The poet's acute observation, "e io facea con l'ombra piui rovente parer la fiamma" (Purg. XXVI, 7-8), frequently cited as an instance of Dante's attention to natural detail, presents an interpretive enigma. It must strongly have im- pressed contemporary readers, for according to recent scholarly speculation the descriptions of shadow behavior in Purgatorio con- stitute the first significant representation of cast shadows in western art since classical antiquity.i But if the canto's main moral teaching is the importance of renouncing sensual beauty, why does Dante place at the canto's head this arresting image of beauty de- pendent on the body's opacity? Both fire and sun assist the pur- gative process yet combine to yield an insipid orange color. It takes the pilgrim's physical obstruction of the sunlight to restore the flame's natural brightness, so that by failure to grow a transparent ' Philip Berk, "Shadows on the Mount of Purgatory," Dante Studies, 97 (1979), pp. 47-63.

The perverse interplay of taboo and pleasurable transgression -prohibition heightening allure by generating a sense of privileged disclosure- has long been familiar to pornographers, not to mention ascetic theologians who knew well the attractions of forbidden fruit.3 The drama of simultaneous concealment and revelation already oc- curred in Inferno V when the pilgrim sought the exact moment of thrilling erotic disclosure in which Paolo and Francesca glimpsed each other's hidden longings. But in Purgatorio XXVI the device of provocatively obscuring is employed pervasively with ingenious variety. To assure its notice, Dante enlists the trope of litotes or double negation something like seven times in seven terzine im- mediately following the description of the shadow (8-27, giving benefit of the doubt to the final instance) and thereafter with great frequency. These litotes, together with various false starts, checked impulses, projections of non-occurring events and beside-the-point similes augment a starved narrative with mystery; they oblige the reader to pick out the true action from a shimmering haze of rejected alternatives, perhaps in the way our sexual imaginations seek among projected phantasms for the beloved's reality. The final section of the canto provides a complex example of this supercharging of the thin narrative. After the false climax of Dante's meeting with Guinizelli, in which the pilgrim does nothing but stare despite his simile's indication of enthusiastically rushing forward,4 the narrative proceeds to its actual climax of the meeting 2 For conventional symbolism of the body (or sensuality) as a wall interposed between God and the soul, cf.

"[Ijeu no me puesc ni voill a vos cobrire," chants Arnaut in the canto's final litotes, simultaneously renouncing both the courtly code of celar and his own practice of trobar clus. But because Arnaut eschews opacity, he speaks, natu- rally, in untranslated Provencal. Which is to say that, although the penitent troubadour achieves new openness, Dante, setting the penitent's speech in a foreign tongue, veils Arnaut's candor and clarity, darkening and making precious, even as the shadow dark- ened the sunbleached flames. Indeed, Arnaut's lingering desire for sensual enclosure is betrayed by the canto's final line when the troubadour, who refused to hide rhetorically, slips back into the flame ("Poi s'ascose nel foco che li affina"; emphasis added); Ar- naut's retreat indicates a chaste wish to purge yet employs sexually suggestive diction inviting confusion with a yet-unpurged desire for furtive physical satisfaction.5 From the shadow's revelation of the fire's beauty to Arnaut's self-hiding, Dante thus valorizes negativity in ways seemingly in- consistent with his Christian purpose. If all the world this side of the Earthly Paradise is by extension a selva obscura, then before the pilgrim passes through the flame to the bright world beyond, the poet clings nostalgically to darkness; Dante appears committed to displaying the virtue of a vice, to redeeming lust aesthetically, in ways unrecognized by previous studies of his approach to carnal sin.6 No easy dismissal of the dunghill vice of medieval homiletics but a poignant appreciation of the beauty sacrificed in attaining heavenly bliss marks Dante's valediction to the flesh. Writing as a cognoscente of sensual delight, he makes sexuality-if pride (or D Thus Arnaut's hiding recalls Guinizelli's earlier invocation of heaven as a "chiostro" rather than open expanse (XXVI, 128; cf. 62-63), and anticipates the beatitude of the sensualist Carlo Martello swathed in a cocoon of light while hap- pily recalling sensual vanities in the Sphere of Venus just within the earth's shadow.

And beyond this aesthetic redemption of lust, Dante even affords sensuality a role in the individual's moral growth since it entails submission to a form of suffering or passio analogous to purgatorial travail. We begin with the cognitive dimension of sensual vice, specifically the biblical conception of sexuality as carnal knowledge wherein "like an act of perfect cognition . .. a truth normally hidden is revealed, appropriated and understood."7 I. The Cognitive Dimension: From Carnal Knowledge to Gnosis Arriving among the lustful Dante hears the penitents crying out illustrious instances of chastity: first Mary, who answered Gabriel, "Virum non cognosco" (XXV, 128), then Diana who expelled Callisto (Helice) from her virgin band after Callisto's seduction by Jupiter: "Al bosco si tenne Diana, ed Elice caccione che di Venere avea sentito il tosco" (XXV, 130-32) Dante's wording lends the Ovidian tale resonance. Cacciare, for example, trades on Diana's role of huntress, implying that Callisto who became a beast through sensuality was hounded out, "hunted." Then too, the word recalls Adam's and Eve's expulsion from the Garden, la cacciata, after which they performed the first sexual act and put on skins of animals. We are at Eden's gateway guarded by the angel with the flaming sword; hence the allusion to Callisto tasting Venus's poison further recalls Eve's seduction by the serpent, while Diana driving out Callisto becomes a type of the Virgin: Ave reverses Eva correcting the fall from grace. This im- agery of sexual degradation echoes in the next canto when bestial Callisto returns as self-bestializing Pasiphae. But to conclude there- fore that Dante utterly rejects the fallen nymph would be precip- itous, for in Paradiso, in Mary's heaven no less, Callisto reappears. Rehabilitated by Jove after expulsion from Diana's wood, she has been turned into a constellation, the Great Bear in the Northern Sky, and there sports with her son Arcas who gives his name to Arcadia, a type of the Earthly Paradise. "[R]otante col suo figlio 7 Zvi Jagendorf, "Strangers in the Night: Sexual Encounters in Religious and Secular Texts," UTQ, 53 (Winter 1983/84), p. 136.</page><page sequence="5">MLN 5 ond'ella e vaga" (Par. XXXI, 33), Callisto becomes a figure of Mary rejoicing in the baby Jesus, and thus at great distance from the seventh terrace converges with her opposite, Diana, who drove her out. Two contrary courses, of abstention (non cognosco) and of ex- perience or knowledge-seeking, lead to beatitude, and the canto paradoxically supports both courses. As figures of abstention, the penitents remaining in their fire and Guido speaking reticently recall Diana holding back in her woods. But also, as figures of exploration, the penitent band resembles a mountaineer entering a wondrous city, while Dante, physically occasioning their wonder, is a traveler voyaging to fetch experience from alien shores (XXVI, 67-69, 73-75). By taking the perilous way, the pilgrim comes among those who can teach him most since, like Callisto's, we shall see, the sensualists' lives were predicated on risk. Addressing itself to a largely unknowable other whose continued allure depends upon its power to keep its secrets, sensuality implies a curiosity or inquisitiveness in the erotic seeker, and so contrasts with the preceding acquisitive vices of greed and gluttony. More specifically, the three incontinent vices form a ratio or progression in which each vice represents an arrested "unripe" version of the next higher vice.8 Thus greed is gold-hunger, "fame de l'oro" ruling "l'appetito de' mortali" (XXII, 40-41) while glut- tony is food-lust, "amor del gusto" (XXIV, 153), arrested in an infantile stage of oral dependency. This schema, pertaining to the human subject's desire for different grades of objects at three de- velopmental stages, is symbolically transferred to the interrelations of the objects themselves. Hence coin, purchasing power, is con- fused with what it can buy, with actual articles of consumption; greedy Crassus' mouth is stuffed with gold, and the question mock- ingly asked, "di che sapore e l'oro?" And immature oral pleasures correspondingly substitute for genital satisfactions. In his lecture on procreation bridging the gluttony and lust cantos, Statius em- ploys alimentary metaphors for sexual functions; perfect blood, he explains, like uneaten food removed from the table, becomes pro- creative seed, much as that desire not channeled into "amor del 8 The metaphor of ripening is introduced in the greed cantos. Watering the ground with tears, the avaricious fail to alleviate its dryness. Thus they become wiser; their souls ripen (XIX, 91, 141). Disinfatuated with barren coin, they ascend to the next terrace where the starving gluttons consume the ripened fruit of their fatted bodies (XXIII, 25), freeing their seed-souls to embark on a procreative journey.</page><page sequence="6">6 RICHARD ABRAMS gusto" fuels lust. Lust in this respect "ripens" lower desires, moving the subject beyond complacencies of materialism (greed) and con- viviality (gluttony) to intangible, demanding pleasures; it encour- ages a venturesome independence of spirit which, whatever its vicious main effect, undeniably renews the soul's vigor.9 To borrow Augustine's famous distinction offruo et uti, each step up the ladder of incontinence is thus achieved by recognition of the sign-status of objects enjoyed below. Indeed, it may be argued that, by exten- sively employing food imagery in his lecture on procreation, Statius rhetorically exemplifies this process of sublimation, demystifying by reducing to a humble sign the idol of the sixth terrace. By exhausting or using up food's mystique in homely similes, he shows food's proper use: to sustain the individual in health and security till sufficiently mature for forays into sexual mystery. With respect to this chain or ladder of signifiers among the in- continent vices (coin standing for food, food for sexual pleasure), the lustful's initial gesture takes on special significance. They are introduced in the characteristic action of trying to move beyond signs by reading the pilgrim's form as an index of God's power to perform miracles. Statius has just finished differentiating aerial from physical bodies, assigning the former to the afterlife, the latter to man's earthly existence, when the penitents, observing the pilgrim casting a shadow in the world of shades, remark on Dante's lifelike opacity as if citing a counterexample to Statius' scrupulous distinctions. The lustful's act of eyeing the pilgrim produces mo- mentary tension, since their lingering carnal obsession is the final impediment preventing these penitents from entering Paradise. Dante stresses the faintness of the sign seducing them from their purgative labors, and we recall perhaps the sodomites ogling a new arrival under the rain of fire. But the suspense is quickly resolved in the penitents' favor. Though the pilgrim dilates graphically on his "membra . . . col sangue suo e con le sue giunture" (56-57), the 9 Compared to the gregarious Forese introducing his latest companions one by one, Guinizelli is ignorant of his fellow penitents' names (XXVI, 89-90). In "In- spiration and Gluttony: The Moral Context of Dante's Poetics of the 'Sweet New Style,'" MLN, 91 (1976), pp. 30-59, I discuss gula as a lower form of libido which could include sexual desire (e.g., Dante's philandering with pargolette) when the latter was oriented to emotional sustenance rather than emotional risk. The secret payoff of pursuing love tokens or even sexual conquests is the male lover's inte- gration with a community of friends making similar mediated object choices (in medieval handbooks of the vices, Gluttony's other name is Good Fellowship).</page><page sequence="7">M L N 7 former lustful view his body innocently as a sign of God's goodness, i.e., as an indizio analogous to the shadow it projects. They are less interested in his members as such than in the vision of grace af- forded by his passage through their realm. This looking beyond the body-as-sign, then, this lawful "trapassar del segno" (Par. XXVI, 117) through which the penitents strive to re-enter Para- dise, locates them midway between their lives of sensuality (hence their swift perception of the flame's slight darkening) and their eventual capacity to know God intimately without mediating signs. They still burn; yet now they burn intellectually as well as carnally, for as Guinizelli carefully turns the metaphor of ardent curiosity (Purg. XXVI, 16-2 1), lust's fire is giving way to that "concupiscence of the spirit" which Augustine identified with "the desire for wisdom."'0 Eager to resolve a theoretical confusion, and certainly not to "know" the pilgrim in a biblical sense, nor even to recall with nostalgia their own lost bodies, the penitents approach seeking enlightenment. Their radical astonishment at Dante's revelation that he indeed lives is a prelude to initiation into the Beatific Vi- sion; their "rimirando" or wondrous staring (68) is a response to glimmerings of what Statius, unfolding the mystery of procreation, called God's view of things, "la veduta etterna" (XXV, 31). The note of ambiguity as the penitents crowd the fire's margins to view the flesh-and-blood pilgrim is sustained throughout the canto. For if lust is a sin of the eyes (e.g., Matt. 5:27-29), so that Dante is admonished to rein in his eyesight on reaching the seventh terrace (XXV, 118-20), then the lustful's redemption is paradoxi- cally conceived, in the words of the beatitude, as the power to see God perfected in the pure of heart (XXVII, 8). Chanting in unison the Virgin's "Virum non cognosco," the penitents nonetheless aspire to acuity of vision or gnosis presented under the aspect of carnal knowledge. As mentioned, it was partly knowledge of sexual func- tion Statius had in mind when he hesitated to reveal below the ineffable things visible to God's eye. Moreover, Statius' subsequent designation of the body (or more precisely the foetus in whose perfection God intellectually rejoices, lovingly inseminating it with a new soul) as "arte di natura" (XXV, 71) implies an object of study as well as physical delight. This cognitive dimension of tactile ex- perience is stressed in a simile when the penitents embrace like ants rubbing muzzles "forse a spfar lor via e lor fortuna" (XXVI, 10 Augustine, De nupt. et concup. ii.52[xxx]; cf. Wisd. 6:21.</page><page sequence="8">8 RICHARD ABRAMS 36). Also, the presence on the seventh ledge of a poet-philosopher and poetic craftsman, together with many references to the arts of homofaber, underscores lust's natural tendency to self-refinement. Sexual fascination with the beautiful body as "arte di natura" shares in God's intellectual love of the foetus, opening on what Brian Stock has called the "existential naturalism" of twelfth cen- tury science. I I In Canto XXV Dante's desire to understand how disembodied shades can grow lean is imaged as a burning (13) in consequence of which Virgil appoints Statius healer of Dante's wounds (30), initiating him into "la veduta etterna" (31). All three elements of fire, wound and vision recur in the penitents' ardor (XXVI, 18) to heal the last wound (XXV, 139) and see God (XXVII, 8). However, the living's lesser capacity for knowing and the dead's greater ca- pacity varies in inverse proportion to the greater and lesser dis- tractions assailing the mind through its possession or lack of a body. To bring this difference home, Dante sets up a counterpoint between the pilgrim's mental wandering (which Virgil warns against, XXV, 118-20) and the penitents' concentration. Thus, as soon as Statius concludes his lecture, the pilgrim is beset by "altra cura" (111), a new and distracting practical concern- the fire blazing in his path. The word cura, here applied to the living pil- grim, bears watching as it rings changes on the penitents' curiosity about Dante's shadow and more distantly plays off of Adam's and Eve's sin of curious aspiration to forbidden knowledge. The pilgrim's "altra cura," it turns out, is a false care, as the echo of cura with the secondary meaning of treatment in the canto's final terzina suggests ("con tal cura ... e con tai pasti"). Though the pilgrim doesn't know it yet, the fire will cure his wound of ignorance when he passes through it unscorched; he will learn that, because God protects, he need not let physical anxiety break his concentration. Meanwhile, however, he tells how he looks this way and that (XXV, 116-17), fearful of the fire and the precipice, yet also curious about the souls singing in the flames (125-26). Curi- osity proper competes with a needless concern ("cura") for life and limb, resulting in divided vision; though Dante wishes to observe the burning souls, he falsely believes he must address himself to physical peril. This motif of divided attention, next reiterated in the opening terzina of Canto XXVI, soon gains the foreground in the pilgrim's broken interview with the inquiring penitents. 11 Stock, Myth and Science, pp. 3, 128-29, et passim.</page><page sequence="9">M L N 9 The question posed by Guinizelli of how Dante scales the moun- tain alive goes unanswered as the second band of penitents enters. This new curiosity, or as Dante now puts it, "altra novita" (27), so distracts him that the first band must renew their question when the second departs. Dante then returns to the main business, ad- dressing the penitents in terms that bring into play his own recent distraction: lo, che due volte avea visto lor grato, incominciai: "O anime sicure d'aver, quando che sia, di pace stato ..." (52-54) By stressing the penitents' sicurezza at this conspicuous juncture of resumed conversation, Dante plays on cura, contrasting the pil- grim-idly curious, care-laden, easily distracted-with the happy dead, simplified or released from alterity by shedding their flesh. Freed by death from both lust's itch and physical anxiety, the dis- corporate penitents have been made sicuri (from Latin cura plus the privative prefix se or sine) in a way the pilgrim cannot but envy as he nervously drags his "mortal part through [their] world" (60). When Virgil in the next canto bids Dante enter the fire "sicuro" (XXVII, 32), the pilgrim hearing the same word he himself applied to the penitents balks "contra coscienza" (33), fear drawing him athwart reason's counsels as "the flesh lusteth against the spirit." But by safely passing to the other side, he fortifies reason and integrates conscience, tying flesh to spirit, so that, returning to the world, he may hope for fuller concentration, whereas presently he is diverted by every object crossing his threshold.'2 To flesh be- longs distraction, to the spirit focus. Hence the pilgrim explains that he climbs the mountain "per non esser piui cieco" (58), upon which Guinizelli, in a skewed paraphrase, catches Dante's intent, blessing the pilgrim for making the ascent "per morir meglio" (75). Visiting the afterworld Dante learns to die better in the sense that assured knowledge of an afterlife will free him from superfluous physical cares. Withdrawing anxious attention from the body as signifier, he will be able, "non cieco," to redouble focus on "la veduta etterna." 12 Cf. Par. XXVI 89-90, where "sicuro" recurs in conjunction with "disio" and "ardore." Cares may create distraction in Purg. XXVI, but in the corresponding canto of Paradiso Dante's own desire to speak to Adam makes him secure in doing so. Earlier his will was divided; now it is whole. Desire cannot err but works hand in glove with conscience.</page><page sequence="10">10 RICHARD ABRAMS The kind of knowledge for which Dante travels is figured in the sensual quest, hence Guinizelli's tribute to the pilgrim, "Beato te, che de le nostre marche ... esperienza imbarche" (72-75). Dante visits the former lustful to load on board, by question and answer, that freight of experience they themselves cultivated in life and now refine in the afterlife. A gloss on Guinizelli's "esperienza" is supplied by the word's occurrence as the goal of Ulysses' mala curiositas in Inferno XXVI where it was similarly coupled with voy- aging; and a further gloss is supplied by the narrative of Paradiso XXVI in which the pilgrim himself displays excessive curiosity. All three cantos numbered twenty-six associate fire with the desire to know. Ulysses in his forked flame tells of "ardore" (Inf. XXVI, 97) to explore terra incognita; the penitent lustful endure refining fire and burn to partake of the beatific vision by comprehending, for example, how Dante travels through the afterworld alive; finally, in Paradise, St. John and the pilgrim burn with love, while Dante additionally burns to question Adam (Par. XXVI, 90), as the lustful burnt to question the pilgrim himself. In all instances, intellectual ardor entails physical risk. Dante's curious desire ("disio") to meet Ulysses causes him to lean over a precipice, bringing Virgil to the rescue; and again on a precipice among the lustful Virgil repeats this office, warning the pilgrim to tighten the rein on his eyes. But in Paradise Dante's failure to curb curiosity regarding St. John's bodily assumption (i.e., his curiosity as to whether John is present in the flesh, recalling the sensualists' curiosity about Dante him- self) causes temporary blindness, as Adam was punished for "il trapassar del segno," and Ulysses for passing the straits "dov' Er- cule segno li suoi riguardi" (Inf. XXVI, 108). These recurrences illuminate Guinizelli's reference to "esper- ienza"-a word etymologically featuring the idea of narrow escape, which occurs three times in the Ulysses episode prior to Ulysses' final shipwreck. Ulysses reminds his men that they have come through "perigli" (113); he confesses his burning desire "a divenir del mondo esperto" (98; from expertus, p.p. of experiri, ultimately, to put oneself at risk), and finally exhorts his shipmates not to deny "l'esperienza" (1 16): exhorts them, that is, to cultivate knowl- edge derived from subjecting oneself to danger. Thus, by praising Dante for loading on board freight of experience from the sen- sualists' bounds, Guinizelli, echoing Ulysses, in effect labels the sensualists experti, spirits who have passed through experience and now inhabit that unexplored land in whose sight Ulysses perished.</page><page sequence="11">M L N 11 Liko Homer's restless adventurer, the sensualists ardently yearned for pleasures linked to risk. This heroic side of carnal vice, which stands out against the foil of comfort-seeking gluttony, is discussed at the beginning of a chapter of Augustine's Confessions which may have inspired Dante's association of sexuality with adventure, and may even constitute a hitherto unrecognized source of the Ulysses episode: In addition to this (sc. "dangerous allurements of the eyes" inducing lust), there is another form of temptation, more complex in its peril (multiplicius periculosa). For besides the concupiscence of the flesh ... there pertaineth to the soul, through the same senses of the body, a certain vain and curious longing (curiosa cupiditas), cloaked under the name of knowledge and learning, not of having pleasure in the flesh, but of making experiments (experiendi) through the flesh. This longing, since it originates in an appetite for knowledge (noscendi), and the sight being the chief amongst the senses in the acquisition of knowledge (cognoscendum), is called in divine language "the lust of the eyes."'3 Now Dante too travels to gain experience. Soon after the Ulysses episode Virgil tells how he conducts his ward through Hell "per dar lui esperienza piena" (Inf. XXVIII, 48); and if certain expe- riences like Dante's Ulyssean peering into St. John's aura are pro- scribed as trapassar del segno, other journeys beyond the world of signs are miraculously allowed. Blessing the pilgrim for his right to ship home experience, Guinizelli implies God's breaking of seals of prohibition in forging Dante as His prophetic instrument. Per- mitted to travel to Mt. Purgatory while still alive, Dante becomes a licensed Ulysses, infallibly escaping perils like the two precipices, while the lustful become fellow travelers or precursors beating a path-courting experience or risking cure (unnerving pleasures) in life -yet emerging safely in death as anime sicure. The sensualists broke "umana legge," testing the limits of the permissible (Purg. XXVI, 83). Yet in keeping with a by-now-familiar paradox they resemble, both in their holy repentance and even in their sinful- ness, the pilgrim who, thanks to God's grace, enjoys a law unto himself, a "privilegio" whereby it is "licito . . . andare al chiostro" where Christ is abbot while still living (127-29). In other words, 13 Conf. X, xxxv[54]; the chapter concludes by mentioning the curious who, lis- tening idly to tales, are led astray-precisely Dante's risk with Ulysses before Virgil steps in, asking a question that produces the appropriate cautionary tale. The erotic coloration of the dream of the siren of course heightens Ulysses' association with lust.</page><page sequence="12">12 RICHARD ABRAMS Dante's privilege to explore God's secrets before his time repre- sents not just a literal transcendence of normal human limits of seeing, but a symbolic transgression of the prohibition against cer- tain extreme forms of (carnal) knowledge violating "umana legge." On the one hand, the former sensualists' curiosa cupiditas recalls Adam's and Eve's presumption to forbidden knowledge. On the other, the way back to Paradise is figured, not as the way of simple abstention or cloistered virtue, but as the way through experience or knowledge. A final illustration of this paradox occurs in the canto's most flagrant instance of sensual vice, which at the same time codifies precisely what is admirable in the penitents' quest for redemption. As the two bands of penitents meet, Dante hears, "'Ne la vacca entra Pasife, perche '1 torello a sua lussuria corra' " (41-42). Later Guinizelli explains: "Nostro peccato fu ermafrodito; ma perche non servammo umana legge, seguendo come bestie l'appetito, in opprobrio di noi, per noi si legge, quando partinci, il nome di colei che s'imbestio ne le 'mbestiate schegge." (82-87) Earlier we noted Pasiphae amplifying Callisto's bestial offense, and Callisto's later transformation into Ursa Major. No similar apo- theosis occurs in the case of Pasiphae; yet interwoven with instanc- es of heavenly striving, her vividly portrayed sin serves simulta- neously as an epitome of sensual vice and a model of redemption by attainment of gnosis. Thus, far from mitigating Pasiphaes bestiality, Dante stresses the deliberate entrepreneurial element, her cunning qui vive as she crouches in the fraudulent cow awaiting the bull's assault. Earlier examples of restraint-Diana keeping back in the woods, the pen- itents' pious care not to step out of their fire -are vexed by analogy with Pasiphae keeping close in the wooden cow. 14 Guido's "erma- frodito" as a strained epithet for heterosexuals following appetite like beasts has puzzled commentators; one justification lies in its force in making graphic Pasiphaes sexual duality, her masculine penetration of the cow ("'Ne la vacca entra Pasife' ") so that she in turn may be entered like a woman. Simultaneously violating 14 For the analogy of sylva and hyle, cf. Stock, Myth and Science, pp. 97-118.</page><page sequence="13">M L N 13 boundaries of male and female, human and animal, animal and inanimate (since the cow is really a sexual contraption), Pasiphae, probably in more ways than anyone in the Comedy, grows to the obsession of trapassar del segno, of traveling beyond pre-set bound- aries to ship experience from foreign shores. In turn, her lust corrupts the royal artificer Dedalus, silent partner to her act, who, besides facilitating Pasiphae's unnatural passion, debauches help- less nature in his capacity as artisan. The planks of wood are em- bestiate in the sense of being fashioned into a cow's shape, but also in the sense that they have been led into a life of sin, bestialized by artistic craft, as though Dedalus worked his will upon them. Finally, as an act of stealth aided by art, Pasiphaes crime recalls Ulysses' strategem of the Trojan horse and the bull of Phalaris, mentioned in similarly numbered cantos (XXVI and XXVII) of Inferno. So Pasiphaes degradation is worse than an isolated act; it suggests a far-reaching symbolic network of vice. Yet if Dante never envisages Pasiphaes redemption like Callis- to's, neither does he close his book in final judgment of her de- viancy. For if Pasiphaes wooden cow recalls Ulysses' wooden horse in Inferno XXVI, it can hardly be coincidental that, when Ulysses is mentioned in Paradiso XXVII, he is antithetically paired with Europa who represents a licit instance of interspecies union with a taurine consort: the god Jove disguised as a bull who carries Europa beyond the known world's boundaries to found a new ci- vilization. The figure of Pasiphae thus underlies the two antithet- ical travelers defining the east-west borders of Dante's world. In malo her sexual curiosity recalls Ulysses' fraudulent horse and un- licensed voyage. But in bono her trapassar calls up the civilization- extending trespass of Europa who, in turn, suggests other privi- leged travelers: Aeneas, Paul, and the pilgrim whose ultimate task, reflected in Guinizelli's blessing, is to recivilize Europe, renewing its Christian commitment. More, as licensed passage from an old world to a new, Europa's voyage looks back on the sensual peni- tents' lawful push beyond mediating signs to intimate knowledge of divinity, so that to Europa, if not to Pasiphae herself, belongs Pasiphae's Callisto-like fulfillment. Through sexual indulgence rather than abstention, Europa achieves holy transfiguration.'5 15 Horace's Europa ode (111.27) presents Europa first as unnaturally lascivious, then as consort to a god.

XXVII, incidentally, by an allusion to Leda) normalizes itself in the traditional yet still daring metaphor of a sexualized mystica unio, to be discussed in the next section. Corre- spondingly, Dedalus' ingenious accommodation of Pasiphae's lust calls up other, worthier instances of craft (e.g., the fabbro Arnaut's licensed oedipal manipulation of the mother tongue), implying a perennial connection between the bedroom vice of sensuality and that public genius whereby civilizations transform themselves in- wardly through invention and innovation. Craft, especially poetic craft, figures so prominently in Canto XXVI as to give the impres- sion that "il peccato e la sua espiazione passano in seconda linea, e cio che ne prende il posto e il culto e la valutazione della poesia."'6 Dante risks letting his main subject drop from sight by portraying on the seventh terrace two accomplished love poets who in life had already largely sublimated their ruling passion, wedding sensuality to respectable disciplines of science and craft. Yet this emphasis on the art occasioned by lust also suggests lust's tendency to cul- tivate refinements of pleasure quite apart from proposing to itself the goal of moral refinement. In what follows I shall argue that, unlike the complacent vices of greed and gluttony, lust implies a desire to stretch the self, to experience "passion" in the double sense of excessive delight and a painful ordeal. Hence lust, which always seeks to burn itself out, is already, for Dante, in some sense penitential avant la lettre. Earlier I insisted on lust's yearning for risk; next, by considering lust's traditional association with sorrow and travail even in its fulfillment, I shall define in sexual desire a blind compulsion to purge which comes to know itself in the joyous pain of the seventh terrace. II. The Affective Dimension: Travail, Passio and the Purgation of Shame After passing through purgatorial fire, the pilgrim dreams a nearly Jupiter; Peter Dronke speculates on a lost tradition linking her with Europa and Pasiphae, "Semiramis: The Recreation of Myth," in Poetic Individuality in the Middle Ages (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970), pp. 66-113, esp. 102-03, 111-13. Though Dante never mentions Semiramis' taurine consort, her transformation of the law (Inf. V, 56) anticipates Pasiphab's breach of "umana legge"; cf. Semiramis, line 178: "Lascivis penitus lex est ablata deabus" [When goddess yields to voluptuousness, law is wholly overcome]. 16 Francesco Gabrielli, "Il Canto XXVI del Purgatorio," Lectura Dantis Romana (Torino, 1963), p. 23.</page><page sequence="15">M L N 15 self interpreting dream of Leah and Rachel. As Jacob worked seven years to win Leah's hand, then indentured himself an ad- ditional seven to win her sister, so the respective joys of the active and contemplative life are figured in Leah, representing "ovrare," and Rachel "vedere" (XXVII, 108). The dream recalls all the pen- itents working their way up the seven-tiered mountain to reach beatitude. But specifically it looks back on the terrace of sensuality, where the delight of "ovrare" was exemplified by the poets Guido and Arnaut who adorned their lives with artistic labor and now seek a higher contemplative crown. Emerging explicitly in Dante's dream, the theme of labor permeates the preceding canto with its imagery of homo faber and is coordinated with the penance of fire, recalling Genesis' angel with flaming sword guarding the gateway of Eden. In other words, as the penitents labor to burn off "quel d'Adamo" (IX, 10)-Adam's flesh and the sensuality it implies they correspondingly strive to transcend Adam's curse, the com- pulsion to work, relaxing like Rachel into contemplative joys they feel themselves under no obligation to produce.'7 This analogy of lust and travail is traditional; it appears, for instance, in Augus- tine's anti-Pelagian tract, On Original Sin, which associates the first parents' concupiscent urgency after the Fall, and the sorrow and violence of subsequent sexual relations (e.g., the dolor of the pen- etrated virgin), with Adam's curse to live by the sweat of his brow and Eve's curse of travail in childbed. 18 More importantly, in Dante and Augustine the notion of travail, which in Genesis (3:17-19) is already virtually synonymous with sorrow, stands for a complex of anxious emotions associated with sex. By attributing to the carnal sinner a desire for travail in this broader sense, Dante thus suggests continuity between the indulgent sensualist's goal in this life and the repentant sensualist's goal in the next, when voluptuary plea- sures are put aside and the soul zealously seeks "[ill buon dolor ch'a Dio ne rimarita" (XXIII, 81). Dante lays the groundwork for his paradoxical treatment of lust by exploring the interrelations of pain and pleasure in the gluttony cantos. Thus, in Canto XXIII Forese develops Statius' hint that purgatorial suffering is voluntary, speaking of the gluttons' pri- 17 As the exit to Pugatory, the ledge of fire balances "la citt;i del foco" at the entry of the city of Dis. Hence the Epicurean heretics' insistence on "arte" (Inf. IX, 120; X, 77) anticipates the sensualists' transcendence of ovrare. For the sensual roots of Epicurean heresy, cf. Giorgio Padoan, "Il canto degli epicurei," Convivium, n.s. 27 (1959), pp. 12-39; also cf. n. 45, below. 18 Augustine, De grat. chris., et de pecc. orig. II, 40-41(xxxv-xxxvi].</page><page sequence="16">16 RICHARD ABRAMS vation as "pena," then changing his word to "sollazzo" (71-75). In explanation Forese describes the penitents' urgency as an inversion of their former vice; whereas once they hungered for food, they now hunger for righteousness, glutting their new appetite on pain itself. The sensualists are doubly anticipated. First, the penitent gluttons' urgency to expiate guilt suggests the sensualists' similar urgency for pain both in life and death. The notion of haste figures centrally. Thus, mentioning the sensualists' haste to return to their penance after greeting each other (XXVI, 31, 38), Dante estab- lishes this urgency as constitutive both of lust and lust's penance (" 'Nella vacca entra Pasife, perche '1 torello a sua lussuria corra,'" 41-42; emphasis added). Second, the cultivation of pain-as-solace is revealed as crucial to eroticism, giving sexual pleasure its tang, a la Bataille. In experimenting with keen sensations and poignant delight, the sensualist commits himself to pre-experiencing mor- tality, working through Adam's curse by means of a quasi-painful or sorrowful expenditure. The paradoxical interplay of pain and pleasure is a medieval commonplace, associated both with requited and unrequited love. As instances of the latter, De Vulgari Eloquentia gives two consec- utive examples of troubadour algolagnia: Folco of Marseilles' poem beginning, "T'an m'abellis," which Dante adapts to the fictional Ar- naut, and Arnaut's own tribute to the "sobraffan" (superfrustration) or "sobramar" (superlove) (DVE, II, vi, 6). In both cases (since it happens that what pleases Folco is love-anxiety, "I'amoros pen- samen"), the lover cherishes his pain which affords him a height- ened sense of his own being worth more than conventional plea- sures. Similarly, as unrequited love yields perverse delight, so sexual satisfaction converges with its apparent opposite in the sweet pain of the petite mort and postcoital sadness. In the first of the rime petrose Dante reasons that if suffering, in the sense of rejection, is sweet, then death must be sweet above all things ("se '1 martiro e dolce, / la morte de' passare ogni altro dolce"). Because "la morte" in this context refers to the love-death, as Robert Durling ob- serves,19 Dante's argument a fortiori rests on a specious conflation of opposites (the petite mort results not from extreme rejection but from acceptance leading to sexual consummation). In this so- phistical conflation of opposites, Dante is supported by a linguistic coincidence: the perfect Provencal homonym, l'amor / la mort is 19 Durling, " 'lo son venuto': Seneca, Plato and the Microcosm," Dante Studies, 93 (1975), p. 110.</page><page sequence="17">M L N 17 easily worked into Italian (e.g., in Francesca's "Amor condusse noi ad una morte"20). But Dante is not just playing with words when he puts into Guido Guinizelli's mouth the extraordinary double entendre in which Guido praises the pilgrim for traveling among the penitent sensualists "per morir meglio" (XXVI, 75). Braving off-color suggestions in the reverberative morir, Dante aligns the sensualists' former craving for a love-death with their present de- sire to mortify the vestiges of bodily existence by undergoing pain which leads to fuller delight. Paradoxes of mingled pleasure and pain, akin to the paradox of the pilgrim's shadow brightening by darkening, pervade the canto, necessitating careful reading of many ambiguous passages. For example, when Guido discloses that he makes early purgation "per ben dolermi prima ch'a lo stremo" (93), he is not necessarily saying that at some particular moment before the end he renounced sex- uality, but may be evoking a lengthy process of disillusionment during which time he came to know the sadness lying at the heart of sexual excess. Of course "ben dolermi" can indicate a clean break from eroticism; but other uses of dolersi in the Comedy authorize a reading in which Guinizelli, connoisseur of sexuality's sweet pain, moves gradually from poignant pleasure (melancholy of requited love) to the sollazzo in pena of invigorating penance.2' In this re- gard, it is significant that the pilgrim conjures Guido in the lan- guage of consummated rather than renounced desire, asking him to tell his name as he hopes to satisfy his "maggior voglia," entering the most spacious heaven "pien d'amore" (61-63). The promise of pleasure seduces Guido to higher ground; in the fire he cultivates the pain which Forese spoke of as the precondition of the soul's betrothal to God. Hence, when Guido re-enters the flame he dis- plays both charity and natural zest, disappearing "come per l'acqua il pesce andando al fondo" (136). The fire at once intensifies and, like the water of the simile (cf. 18), slakes his burning. In his sprightly departure Guido bears witness to Augustine's belief that "the love of temporal things could only have been expelled by some sweetness in things eternal" (De mus. VI, xvi, 52). Conversely, the strained, anxious element in sexual gratification 20 Cf. Susan Noakes, "The Double Misreading of Paolo and Francesca," PQ, 62 (1983), pp. 235-36. 21 Cf. the pilgrim's restrained (and therefore sustained) joy-in-tristizia in the simile following Guido's self-identification. For dolersi as sustained grieving, Inf. XXVI, 19, 62; Purg. VII, 126. Dolore for love-pangs is ubiquitous and perhaps informs Arnaut's later pious use of dolor; cf. n. 27, below.</page><page sequence="18">18 RICHARD ABRAMS makes the pain of the fire less an antithesis than a culmination of love's pain. From this perspective it is useful to re-examine the notorious crux of the "two fires": the one an agent of purification, the other symbolic of the very ardor that is purified. Faced with potentially contradictory symbols, commentators have reasoned that the penitential fire burns out lust's metaphorical fire by a kind of homeopathic magic as one nail drives out another.22 But if sex- uality is recognized as a purgative ordeal in its own right, this false antithesis disappears. From a Christian ascetic standpoint sexual indulgence contrasts with pious abstinence; yet the troubadour poets, vexing this distinction, never tired of proclaiming the power of sustained ardor to purify the soul, situating the scriptural met- aphor of refining fire at the heart of the cult of fin' amors. To the sexual cognoscente, indulgence is not abstinence's contrary but in itself a subtler form of suffering. Either rejection racks the lover or excessive pleasure teases and torments him till finally he half- welcomes the consummation of delight in a petite mort. The question then is why choose lust when one can settle for the complacencies of greed and gluttony. Dante's implied answer, I think, is a variation on Freud's death wish. Lust originates in a desire to suffer, to yield oneself up to purgative travail. From the carnal sinner's situated viewpoint, sexual desire repeatedly ex- hausts itself in individual acts of consummation, and with each act the palate is sharpened for keener, more refined pleasures, yet again and again one returns to unfulfillment, regret. Indeed, this refining process continues in the afterworld where the penitents, "dentro a l'alvo di [la] fiamma" (XXVII, 25-26), in Dante's semi- erotic metaphor, experience a different mixture of pain and joy. But the carnal sinner cannot really comprehend the scope of the refining process in which he is involved. It begins with the "foco d'amor" (96) of Cytherean Venus, which not only oversees the penitents' purgation on the mountain (cf. 1. 19 and Singleton's note ad loc.) but operates in the living sensualists who, for reasons un- clear to themselves in ardently pursuing "il folle amor," embrace their own suffering as exquisite. Viewing sexual desire as essentially masochistic, Dante corre- spondingly understands God's goodness or caritas as effecting a cure by the excitation of shame. St. Paul, quoting Proverbs (25:22), sets forth the relevant principle when he tells how acts of kindness 22 Cf. Allan Gilbert, Dante's Conception of Justice (New York: AMS Press, 1965), pp. 136-39.</page><page sequence="19">M L N 19 heap burning coals on an enemy's head, kindling shame which refines him (Rom. 12:20). Thus Guinizelli's comment, directed at the homosexuals but presumably encompassing all the lussuriosi, that, reproaching themselves, "aiutan l'arsura vergognando" (XXVI, 81), unlocks the purgative process. Physiologically, shame entails blushing and a raised body temperature, hence literally fuels the fire, making it burn hotter and redder. And more im- portantly, because the sinners' embarrassment distances them from their shameful acts, they aid the fire in its work of refinement. Knowing that God has called them, the benedicti Patris, to Himself, kindles inward burning, or deep feelings of unworthiness and grat- itude, purging them of lustful desire to stray from the divine spouse. This process of refinement, it is worth re-emphasizing, begins not with their arrival on Purgatory Shore, but with the very inception of sexual desire. In Augustinian theology shame informs the first sexual act, determining the character of all subsequent sexual behavior. When, after the Fall, Adam and Eve perceive their genitals' involuntary arousal, they are reminded of their own revolt against the Father; and their ensuing consummation-cataclysmic, filled with "turbid heat"-their putting-on of figleaves and hiding from God, reflect the condition of self-disgrace into which they have fallen.23 To be sure, no hint of sexuality's purging anything but lust's itch ever appears in Augustine. But the prominent link with shame argues Augustine's strong awareness of humankind's chronic sexual alienation leaving it to Dante's purgation theology to develop this hint by identifying in the sensualists' restless rejec- tion of mediocre comforts a yearning for the salutary pain awaiting the repentant in the fires of Purgatory. Not only lust but also shame requires purging on the seventh terrace, as illustrated by the encounter with Arnaut. To make room for Arnaut, Guinizelli generously gives up his place by the fire's edge ("Poi, forse per dar luogo altrui secondo"), and Arnaut echoes Guido's generosity by opening his own heart to the pilgrim ("ieu no me puesc ni voill a vos cobrire"). But after Arnaut makes good his promise not to hide his identity and affirms his charitable concern for the pilgrim's welfare ("sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor"), he re- turns to the fire, presumably to hide from God ("Poi s'ascose . . ."). The sequence cobrire-ascondere-in the first case, concealment of part of oneself from a fellow creature, in the second, hiding from 23 Augustine, De civ. Dei, xiii.13; xiv.26; C. duas epist. Pelag. i.32[16]; De pecc. merit. et remiss. ii.36[22].</page><page sequence="20">20 RICHARD ABRAMS the Father-precisely recalls the rhythms of Genesis (3:7, 10), in which Adam and Eve first put on figleaves, then hide from the Lord,24 and the sequence therefore suggests that Arnaut must wrestle with shame as well as lust before attaining redemption. On the one hand, non cobrire establishes a terminus ab quo; the reader judges the degree of purgation that has already taken place. Evi- dently Arnaut has made significant progress, for in casting off the garment of an obscure style he achieves transparency contrasting with his poetic practice of trobar clus and ric.25 Lust's antithesis, the caritas incidentally displayed in Arnaut's generous self-disclosure to the pilgrim, drives out the sexual shame which caused Adam to cover his nakedness. But on the other hand, ascondersi establishes a terminus ad quem; Arnaut's need to hide bespeaks entrenched feelings of unworthiness. Though no longer given to communi- cating in closed-off ways, he is still unready to meet God face to face. Therefore, hiding in the fire, he studies to make himself more beautiful to the divine spouse by further suffering. Only when Adamic shame as well as lust is cleansed may the soul throw off its cloak of darkness and step into the light of grace. In symbolizing this transition to heavenly bliss, Dante draws on the most exalted of physical experiences, sexual ecstasy, which al- ready contains the notion of a death to the world. On the threshold of ecstatic dissolution, Arnaut appears in excessu mentis (Richard of St. Victor's phrase); his use of sexual imagery is oblique but un- mistakable. Tearfully ejaculatory, Arnaut lays claim to contrary extremes of emotion and speaks of escalating toward pure joy, of the pilgrim (and by implication himself when his time arrives) reaching the top of a stair guided by a greater power ("valor"); 24 Cf. Adam's abscondi me in Vulg. Gen. 3:10. Though no verb in Gen. 3:7 cor- responds to Arnaut's cobrire, a correspondence with Adam's act of covering up for shame may be inferred from the manner in which Arnaut's usage echoes Forese's tirade against the "sfacciate donne fiorentine" who, as "svergognate," display their breasts, whereas even barbarous women go "coperte" for shame, XXIII, 101-06. Cf. Augustine, De civ. Dei, xiv. 17. In several respects Arnaut recalls Guido da Mon- tefeltro, the second spirit interviewed in a place of fire in a like-numbered canto; cf. Guido da Montefeltro's pursuit of "le coperte vie" (Inf. XXVII, 76), and his exit, "vestito" and "dolorando" (129, 131), like the departing Arnaut who grieves and hides in the fire; also Purg. V, 129. 25 Sapegno glosses XXVI, 141, "il rifiuto ... di un gusto gia caro di rime arcane e chiuse." The question of Arnaut's allegiance to trobar clus, ric or leu is presently disputed, but Arnaut's own words must have suggested to Dante a penchant for stylistic hiding; cf. the coda of "L'aura amara" which speaks of remaining "Totz sers"; also st. 3 of "Doutz brais e critz" which tells of "mas paraulas coutas"; for "parlar coverto," Inf. IV, 51. Cf. Augustine's interesting discussion of euphemisms. as fig- leaves, De nupt. et concup. ii.17[vii].</page><page sequence="21">M L N 21 then he sheathes himself again in the fire's depths. Purging lust, Arnaut figuratively consummates it; he prepares himself "dentro a l'alvo di [la] fiamma" to heed the angel's "Venite" (XXVII, 25-26, 58), whereby, through "the good pain that remarries us to God," he may come to know the deity directly. The paradoxical use of the metaphor of sexual death for the culminating of desire's pur- gation is consonant with my earlier analysis of sensuality's under- lying expiatory motive and with many previously discussed ambi- guities: the correspondence of carnal knowledge and gnosis, the problematic of the "two fires," the double entendre of "per morir meglio," etc. Though appearing blasphemous, this metaphor of a mystical love death is traditional; it occurs in Bernard of Clairvaux, whom the actual Arnaut may have parodied in his sestina, "Loferm voler," employing the word cambra (chamber or room, with con- notations of his lady's womb) in a manner evocative of Song of Songs' hortus conclusus, glossed by Bernard as Paradise.26 But the fictional Arnaut's sexually tinged vocabulary differs in tone from the actual Arnaut's double entendres. For example, the scarlet his- tory of a word like joi (orgasmic delight) richly shadows the fictional Arnaut's disclosure, as the "foreignness" of his Proven~al was ear- lier argued to make precious by obscuring. Yet whatever richness Arnaut's sexual diction lends we sense to be at variance with the penitent's intent, even as Arnaut's "foreignness" belied his in- tended candor. There is almost a gay abandonment in Arnaut's present use of sexually suggestive expressions which points up the difference between what Arnaut was and is as a result of purging sin. As Arnaut undergoes purgation, so does his language; the word joi, for example, refines itself, throwing off its fallen meaning or double entendre and returning to a pristine definition.27 Ar- 26 Linda Paterson, Troubadours and Eloquence (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), p. 197, n. 4, 5. Charles Jernigan, "The Song of Nail and Uncle; Arnaut Daniel's Sestina 'Lo ferm voler q'el cor m'intra,'" SP, 71 (1974), discusses the sexual meaning of celar in Arnaut's sestina. He suspects Dante similarly read the sestina erotically and concludes, "it is ... evident that a poet [Arnaut] who considered his paradise to be his lady's sexual parts and purposefully confused his penis with his soul . . . would need the refining fire of paradise before he could enter the real paradise of the spirit.

Cf. n. 5, above. 27 Cf. Maurice Bowra, "Dante and Arnaut Daniel," Speculum, 27 (1952), pp. 469- 70. Perhaps "sovenha vos ... de ma dolor" is meant to echo the troubadour formula of pleading for love in compensation for one's pain; if so, the contrast between old and new meanings of the formula underlines the notion of caritas superseding eros. Cf. n. 21, above.</page><page sequence="22">22 RICHARD ABRAMS naut's echoes with a difference of his old sexual repertory are in the best sense shameless, for by joyously rehearsing former plea- sures, as Cunizza and Carlo Martello will do, he makes a whole offering of himself to the Father. Certainly Statius was correct to maintain that the soul may emerge from purgatorial suffering at a moment of its own choosing, but my argument has shown the narrowness of this ex- planation. To imagine the lustful leaving the flames in the moment they feel themselves free of carnal longings scants the complex phenomenon of shame or remorse, and scants the complexity of sexual desire itself, which has been analyzed as a desire for pain as well as pleasure born of the soul's consciousness of guilt. Because desire to labor in the flesh, working through fear of mortality with "little deaths," is already quasi-penitential, the moment of tran- scendence is structured litotically as a double negation-a renun- ciation of repentance which, in the poet Yeats's phrase, "keeps [the] heart impure." In life, sexual travail brings mixed pleasure and sorrow; and beyond the grave the desire for sorrow, for dolersi, outlives the desire for physical pleasure. But finally even the act of repenting is felt to be superfluous and can be given up, the penitents' new self-leniency thereby marking a release of the inner man from Adam's curse. When in the fire the sensualist is no longer gratified by self-mortification recalling his carnal desire to mix pleasure with pain in a petite mort, when he can in conscience take his pleasure straight, luxuriating in paradisal joys he feels under no compulsion to produce, then his term of spiritual travail or Jacob-like bondage is ended.28 Not pleasure per se, but labor, pain, darkness, anxiety, which falsely enhance pleasure like the shadow darkening the flame, are sacrificed, and the unashamed soul, deeming itself worthy of happiness, comes out of hiding. The foregoing account of purgation applies to all the penitents. The two we meet are poets; yet in discussing Guido and Arnaut I have so far made no further point about their vocations than to argue from their exacting artistic labors lust's innate tendency to refine itself. In the remainder of this essay, however, I shall more explicitly take up the interrelations of lust, poetry and purgation. Many critics have noted that, as a consequence of purging lust, Guido and Arnaut have grown disinfatuated with love poetry. In 28 For the male, in his traditional role as producer of sexual pleasure, seeking ecstatic dissolution, cf. Charles E. May, "Perversion in Pornography: Male Envy of the Female," Literature and Psychology, 31 (1981), pp. 66-74.</page><page sequence="23">M L N 23 supporting this view, I shall show the psychological and theological basis of the penitents' attitude toward art, describing a disaffection from poetry in general (not just love poetry), explicit in Guido, implicit in Arnaut, resulting from the purgation of sensuality and their increased detachment from their bodies. Dante lays the groundwork for this notion of the sensual poets' purged infatua- tion with textuality in De Vulgari when he derives language's com- plex structure from man's physical opacity, obliging man to couch or corporealize intellectual meanings (the soul of communication) in spoken and written signs (DVE, I, iii, 1-2). Also, in Purgatorio XXV, soon after Canto XXIV's famous description of the poet's pen following the dittatore converting oral cues to scribal notations, Statius implicitly aligns the two kinds of signs, spoken and written, with the aerial and physical bodies of the dead and living respec- tively.29 The penitents fall into the first group. But as they spiri- tually labor to throw off what we might call the body-mindedness bred in them by their former physical existences, this labor pro- duces, as a side-effect, a disdain for the written word, which is the body of thought, and which offers to the mind a mere simulacrum of eternal life ("come l'uom s'etterna," believed Brunetto). As a point of departure for our next stage of inquiry, we return to the shadow on the flame, noting its semiotic function as an indicator of the pilgrim's physical presence. III. Purging Textuality: From Writing to Vox Viva The seventh terrace is one of constant sound as well as brilliant light. Even before the pilgrim observes souls walking in fire, he hears a psalm issuing from the brightness, as though the fire were singing. In a thrice-repeated sequence, soft psalmody alternates with the loud proclamation of examples of lust and charity. But then his shadow, which Dante terms an "indizio" (XXVI, 8), falls on the flames, transfixing the penitents who, after brief silence ("vidi molt' ombre, andando, poner mente"), discuss the matter among themselves. What is the force of the rare word "indizio" 29 Robert Durling, "Deceit and Digestion in the Belly of Hell," Allegory and Rep- resentation, English Inst. Essays, 5, ed. Stephen Greenblatt (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1981), connects Statius' embryology with the physiology of speech-production, p. 82; p. 93, n. 62. For writing (act and product) as metaphor for sexual activity and progeny, cf. Paula Neuss, "Images of Writing and the Book in Chaucer's Poetry," RES, n.s. 32 (1982), pp. 385-97.</page><page sequence="24">24 RICHARD ABRAMS which signals a dramatic silence followed by a lively conversational exchange apparently unusual on this terrace? Occurring only one other time in the Comedy, "indizio," from Latin index + lum, shades in meaning toward the more common "indice" (never used by Dante), especially in the latter's association with the digitus index. In its only other usage, Virgil asks Sordello for directions ("'alcuno indizio da' noi,'" VII, 37-38) in a context where preceding and subsequent phrases suggest his wish for a manual indication of the way. Thus, soon after one of the shades, noticing Dante's shadow, excitedly points with his finger (V, 3), allusions to pointing directions (VI, 68), pointing out the sights (VII, 46 and Singleton's note ad loc.) and even an allusion to Sor- dello drawing a line with his finger in the dust (VII, 52-54) un- derscore Virgil's request for a gestural sign. Similarly, prior to Dante's second use of "indizio" references to pointing crop up again. Several conspicuous instances occur at the end of Canto XXIII after Forese notices Dante's shadow. Re- counting how he embarked on his journey, the pilgrim describes the moon's shining in a construction which, gratuitously subordi- nating the moon as sister (" 'quando tonda vi si mostro la suora di colui [the sun]' "), obliges him to echo mostrare in the next line in pointing out the sister's brother (" '1 sol mostrai," 121). This act of double indication recurs at the end of the canto when Dante, in- troducing Virgil, points with his finger ("e addita'lo"), apparently repeating the gesture in introducing Statius (" 'e quest' altro e quell' ombra' "). Then in the next canto Forese, making introductions, points to Bonagiunta (" 'Questi,' e mostro col dito, 'e Bonagiunta,'" XXIV, 19) and probably others (20-22). So by the time we arrive at the second "indizio," we have twice focused on the act of pointing, both times in connection with Dante's shadow. By these contextual enrichments, "indizio" is drawn out of its usual con- notative orbit where it means an involuntary sign or trace and takes on overtones of an intentional sign, a pointer. Indeed, associating "indizio" with the digitus index, we note a symmetrical pointer pointing deeper into the flames at the end of the canto, whereas the shadow as "indizio" at the beginning points outward. For on the next occasion calling for a social presentation after Forese's round of introductions, Guinizelli introduces Arnaut ("'1 mos- trato," XXVI, 138) with an emphatic manual gesture (" 'questi ch'io cerno col dito,' e addito un spirto innanzi, 'fu miglior fabbro,' " 115- 17; emphasis added), balancing the shadow's earlier indication of</page><page sequence="25">M L N 25 Dante himself. Not only the shadow brightening the flames, but also the word establishing the shadow's semiotic function thus car- ries implications for the later narrative. There may be reason to connect the bright, indicial shadow with a special kind of pointer: the floating marginal hand (manicula) of medieval manuscripts, which commends a text to a reader or links it with its gloss (figures 1-6).30 Supported by Canto XXIV's imagery of writing (the pen taking dictation) and a possible reference to luminous imprinting in Canto XXV (91-96), the interpretation of Dante's shadow as a textual indicator has interesting consequences. First, the penitents' comment on Dante's body, "'Colui non par corpo fittizio' " (XXVI, 12), which today sounds so literary because of fittizio's having settled into the meaning "fictive" already strong in Dante's time,31 would be further strengthened in its literary connotations by its association with a marginal hand. The word, in short, would not require its modern gloss of "insubstantial." In- stead, the passage would suggest that the penitents as readers, particularly the learned Guinizelli, are piqued by a text perceived as significant because non-fictitious. Then too, the pilgrim's de- scription of his body as an articulated structure (56-57) suggests textual interweaving, anticipating his remark about lining pages for composition moments later (64). Finally, the complex simile indirectly comparing the pilgrim's body to a city in which an en- 30 The printer's device of a pointing hand enters English as "index," but I can trace no pretypographic usage (in antiquity, the index was a colored title slip iden- tifying the work). As far as I can tell, the history of the manicula remains to be written. Its forebears include the author portraits of early medieval texts, cf. Kurt Weitzmann, Ancient Book Illumination (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1959), pp. 116-27. In the Carolingian Sacra Parallela, it is often difficult to distin- guish a pointing author, like John of Damascus writing a title, from a speaker like Solomon captured in a lecturing gesture and juxtaposed with the text. As this essay went to press, I discovered the remarkable anthropomorphic pointing capitals co- piously reproduced in Kurt Weitzmann, Die Byzantinische Buchmalerei des IX. und X. Jahrhunderts (Berlin: Gebr. Mann, 1935). Many illustrations stage the disappearance of the scriptor into the initial capital pointing to the other letters in the text. The most common pointing capital appears to be epsilon, whose central horizontal bar becomes a gesturing hand; the letter echoes the body-shape of the seated scriptor, knees bent, hand extended and head inclined over his book (see esp. PI. 410). In these often-whimsical alphabetic maniculae, one seems to witness the transformation of flesh into word via the scriptor's hand. Probably the best-known marginal por- traits of a pointing author are those of Chaucer commending his text in the Elles- mere and Hoccleve manuscripts. 31 Gioacchino Paparelli, "Fictio: La definizione dantesca della poesia," Ideologia e Poesia di Dante (Firenze: Olschki, 1975), pp. 53-128, reviews Dante's Latin and Italian uses of the word, though omits discussion of Purg.

As Paolo and Francesca, undoubtedly reading aloud, became mute like the words left unenunciated in their book when they sealed their mouths with a kiss, and were</page><page sequence="28">28 RICHARD ABRAMS therefore sent to a place "d'ogne luce muto," so the sensualists are briefly stilled. In actuality their silence results from a pious rec- ognition of miracle; yet in context it also suggests ocular enchant- ment, hence a symbolic relapse to their phase of carnal indulgence. Like the unlettered peruser of a text whose eyes fix on the archi- tecture of the page, on mere signs he cannot vocalize, so the pen- itents gaze fascinated, bereft of speech. Dante's presentation of bodies as text-like underscores the fact that texts themselves are literally extensions of the body, works of the hand. The intimate relationship of body and book, clearer in manuscript culture where texts are hand-copied than in typo- graphic culture, becomes apparent when the pilgrim concludes his anatomical description of his own body with a reference to his function as scriptor among the living, asking the penitents' names " 'accio ch'ancor carte ne verghi'" (64).32 With Dante's allusion to the procedure of measuring guidelines on sheets of paper, synec- dochic for "the report the wayfarer will make of his journey through the afterlife," the conversation, as Singleton observes, turns to "the subject of writing poetry." But we miss the technical- minded synecdoche's point unless we observe that the act of writing deserves equal emphasis with what is written (love poetry). No doubt Guido and Arnaut appear among the lustful because they specialized in amatory verse. But besides the content, Dante insists on the material aspect of their poems as embodied utterances, not only in the obvious case of Arnaut but also in Guinizelli's case. Whereas Arnaut styled himself a wordsmith, deliberately writing for the page, Guido only incidentally committed his rhymes to paper as a hedge against the words dying out. But in Canto XXVI the "saggio" of Vita Nuova is wrested into the role of scriptor, a conspicuous detail like the allusion to lined pages telegraphing Dante's intent to magnify the craft-element of Guido's art in prep- aration for introducing the "miglior fabbro." Initially offering to enroll all the penitents in his book, Dante addresses them collectively. But after Guido identifies himself, the pilgrim's offer changes to one of individual service (104); he prom- ises in effect to become a medium of Guido's transmissions, per- forming a scribal function. At first Guido fails to understand. Varying Canto XXIV's figure of the inner dittatore, he implies that such service is supererogatory, attesting that he has already been 32 Durling, art. cit., pp. 84-87, discusses Dante's book as an extension of his body.</page><page sequence="29">M L N 29 lastingly imprinted, his memory furrowed as with a stylus, by Dante's kind offer (106-09).33 But though deeply moved, Guido cannot guess why a stranger holds him dear. In explanation Dante praises Guido's written handling of the vernacular, citing as his reason for cherishing the older poet, "'Li dolci detti ... che, quanto durera l'uso moderno, faranno cari ancora i loro incostri' " (112-14). If the pilgrim lastingly marks Guido's memory, his reason, symmetrical with Guido's accomplishment, is that his mentor lastingly stained the page with the words of his sweet songs. Finally Guido understands. But his response, "'O frate'" (115), suggests weary indifference, as though the "dolci detti" for which Dante professes lasting admiration strike him as a limited achieve- ment. In deference to Dante's interest in poetic craft Guido intro- duces Arnaut as a more skilled artisan. But as for himself, Guido cannot be tempted back into the world of texts whose association with the body is underscored by Dante's remark about cleaving to Guido's inkmarks-the written word's "carnal" component standing in the same relation to thought as the body's "sangue ... e ... giunture" stand to the soul (57). To "hold front" in the world of generation (cf. Inf. XXVII, 57), knowing that his lifework has been extended by the pilgrim's apprentice-like "servigio," or oth- erwise to establish a poetic bloodline among authors of discern- ment, is a prospect of scant appeal to Guinizelli, who answers Dante's "padre" with "frate." Therefore, politely refusing Dante's two offers of scribal service, Guido asks a favor of the poet's voice rather than pen. Disinclined to stage a comeback among the living or to usurp that paternal authority owing ultimately to Cacciaguida who will assign Dante his earthly mission of service, Guido asks only that the man who called him father name him above in a Paternoster atoning him with the true Father, so that as his name is spoken in God's presence his soul may soon follow. More than Guinizelli, Arnaut composed expressly for the page, surpassing all other troubadours in "singleminded" insistence that fin' amors inspires not just heart-felt song but "the highest standard of workmanship."34 Indeed, as Maurizio Perugi establishes, the epithet "fabbro" translates Provencal obrador, from the verb, cog- nate with Italian ovrare, that repeatedly appears in Arnaut's verse.35 33 Incision and inscription were commonly conflated; e.g., the angel, incising seven P's on Dante's brow, speaks metaphorically of washing them away, Purg. IX, 113. 34 Paterson, Troubadours and Eloquence, pp. 188-89. 35 Perugi, "Arnaut Daniel in Dante," Studi Danteschi, 51 (1978), pp. 118-19.</page><page sequence="30">30 RICHARD ABRAMS Arnaut thus anticipates Leah whose dedication to ovrare consisted in handiwork, the weaving of garlands with her "belle mani" as she accompanies herself "cantando" (XXVII, 99-108). Transferred from an acoustic to a graphic frame, language, attaining its con- dition of greatest concreteness, lends itself to being "worked on"; it allows an Arnaut, in his own phrase, to fashion and file worthy utterances ("Obre e rim / mos de valor"), inventing a form like the sestina in which the reader's eye as well as ear validates the poet's achievement. But though Arnaut once excelled in shuffling words on the page, his purged carnality entails a slackening of his addic- tion to textuality. Not only has he forsaken composition for psalm- ody but, as his coupling of "plor e vau cantan" suggests, he finds release in unpremeditated speech. His words flow as freely as those involuntary signs, his squandered tears, perhaps giving fresh point to his name as a freely occurring echo of the river Arno.36 Beginning with reported psalmody and the penitents' loud proc- lamations, the sensualist episode traces a circular movement through silence and hesitancy to Arnaut's fluency to the angels' sung benediction when Dante enters the flames; moreover, this movement recapitulates the transformations, in the process of reading aloud, from vocable to script back to vocable again when the written word is freed from the silent page. For much of the canto, Dante's conversation with Guido is spare, allusive; Guido guardedly favors qualifiers like "forse" (17, 23, 89, 109, 127), and the poet echoes this circumspection on Guido's departure (133). There are two pauses (on discovery of the shadow, on the homo- sexuals' entry) and two full silences (68, 100-01). But all this cau- tion, recapitulated in the pilgrim's "cortes deman" when he advances "un poco" to question Arnaut, is swept away by Arnaut's torrent of words and tears. Then the next canto presents the penitents' singing masters: the angel standing outside the flames chanting the beatitude of chastity "in voce assai piui che la nostra viva" (XXVII, 9; emphasis added); and the other on the far side, com- mended to Dante's party in words bidding them enter the fire "'e al cantar di la' non siate sorde' " (12; cf. 56-60). Thus, the sensualist poets' repudiation of the page becomes a relevant model for all the penitents in their aspiration to vocality. In an implicit metaphor for purification underlying the whole canto, the penitents strive to restore their souls to the pristine state of the spoken word, casting 36 Roger Dragonetti, "The Double Play of Arnaut Daniel's Sestina and Dante's Divina Commedia," Yale French Studies, 55-56 (1979), p. 229.</page><page sequence="31">M L N 31 off the carnal husk of the letter. Singing and shouting, they seek to harmonize with the angel's vox viva recitative, freeing their souls from fleshly captivity through an act of spirit paralleling the re- vocalization of a written word or musical notation.37 As the final portal to Paradise through which the penitents pass singing, the wall of fire corresponds to Purgatory Gate swinging musically on its hinge when Dante enters. So the return to rich sound in Canto XXVII brings us full circle not only to Dante's entry onto the seventh terrace (the only other terrace with a mus- ical overture) but to his entry to Purgatory proper. Singing their way to bliss, the sensualists conclude what the first group, the prideful laboring to slough their attachment to their own bodily strength, began. Thus, the terrace of pride expands the context in which to consider the sensualists' movement beyond mute signs to a condition of vocal freedom. One image is particularly relevant. Passing through Purgatory Gate, the pilgrim encounters seemingly vocal sculptures, "visibile parlare," among them an intaglio of the Annunciation in which Mary silently declares herself God's hand- maid. Many of the scene's details recur in the approach to the seventh terrace and on the terrace itself,38 suggesting that the sen- sualists' movement beyond the carnal letter may be read as a vari- ation on the canticle's central motif of untwisting the soul's "mal amor" to permit rebirth of the Word. Chanting Mary's reply to Gabriel, the sensualist penitents labor to recapture their hearts' purity before lust entered; like Mary who offered her divine spouse a spotless medium, they prepare a place in their souls for a voice "assai piu che la nostra viva." By grace of this divine voiceover or underwriting of language by the Word, the soul frees itself from the shifting linguistic field evoked by Adam in Paradiso XXVI, gaining that eternity to which the word on the page vainly aspires. The penitents at last become living letters as St. Paul wished his Corinthian brethren to become, "written not in ink, but 37 Cf. leggere for proclamation, a common usage supported by the practice of reading aloud, XXVI, 85. For failure to move beyond the letter as carnal servitude, Augustine, De doc. chris. iii, 5, 7-10. 38 The angel proclaiming "la molt'anni lagrimata pace" (X, 35) echoes in "pace" of XXIV, 141 and XXVI, 54.

Litotes is employed to describe the eloquence of the sculpture carved by the divine "fabbro" ("non sembiava imagine che tace," X, 39; cf. the stilled silence of XXVI, 71-72). The sphere of fire in Dante's dream of the eagle IX, 30-32, foretells his later passage through fire on the seventh terrace.</page><page sequence="32">32 RICHARD ABRAMS with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart (2 Cor. 3:3).39 IV. A Voluptuary Poetics On the mountain's upper slopes, poetic concerns crowd the- ology, from the passage in which Statius recidivistically wishes him- self alive in Virgil's era, giving pride of place to art over religion (" 'Per te poeta fui, per te cristiano,'" XXII, 73), till Arnaut steps forward, restoring spiritual concerns to primacy. That this role belongs to Arnaut is surprising, especially in view of Guido's in- troduction of him as the consummate artisan. We might reasonably have expected Arnaut to talk shop, yet he never alludes to poetry except perhaps under the rubric, "la passada folor." Arnaut's pur- gation of lust has apparently produced a change in his estimation of art. No longer sensually inclined, he cares little for love poetry and has lost interest in "speaking to paper" (Montaigne's phrase), preferring relatively simple, spontaneous speech to artistic invo- lution. His situation is like Bonagiunta's; by purging lust Bona- giunta transcends an orally fixated poetic orientation, arriving at a posthumous recognition of the knot that held him back from lyric grace.40 But lust's case, we have seen, is more complex than that of gluttony; like a virtue, lust ripens the soul to rise beyond a mediocre desire for creature comforts, instituting a yearning to know which cannot rest till it comes in sight of its divine object. With reference, then, to sensuality's saving graces, it is worth asking whether Dante's ambivalence to lust is not reflected in a view of the advantages this vice may impart to poetry generally, and to his own special attempt to win souls to God by becoming a kind of Galeotto, coloring the sacred poem almost in a voluptuary manner "com' amor vuol" (XIX, 15). In the space remaining, I shall indicate two aspects of Dante's art linked to sensuality. The first concerns the physical status of the Comedy as a poem for the page originally made available to its readers in hand-copied in- stallments. 39 James Thomas Chiampi, Shadowy Prefaces: Conversion and Writing in the "Divine Comedy," L'interprete, no. 24 (Ravenna: Longo Editore, 1981), discusses sin's dis- figuration of the soul's perfect writing; cf. esp. p. 48.

He is a kind of reconstructed Jason, for the latter in his career as a seducer hid behind a facade of mute "segni e . . . parole ornate" (Inf. XVIII, 19), never letting sincere emotion show through his amorous ploys. Likewise Arnaut, who now speaks and cries freely while Jason remains dry-eyed in Hell, once put words together seductively in the silence of his workshop to catch the ear with their complex music and to fascinate the eye. He interposed a richly figured screen between himself and his audience, sacrificing intimacy (linked with the voice, Purg. XXIII, 43-48) by routing communication through the page.41 In this sense, by writing pat- tern-poems like the sestina, Arnaut tied his reader's eye to the physical site of aesthetic experience; quite apart from its amorous content, his poetry offered a stylistic seduction to dwell in the body rather than the soul of words. But though Arnaut's case is extreme and nothing could be farther from Dante's purpose than to offer his readers an aestheticized plaisir du texte, the sacred poet too rec- ognizes the value of making the literal level seductive. His text, as Dante views it, can afford to overlook no means of establishing itself as a generative presence in the world of generation, fathering a bloodline of copies and copies from copies, a moral progeny, and ultimately perhaps a succession of literary heirs or imitators.42 In sum, as a living author who must make his way among readers with human frailties, Dante labors under different exigencies than the penitents concerned only with preparing to commune with God. This difference between the aims of the living and dead is signaled by an inversion of dominant image-patterns. For ex- ample, pulling up stakes in the material world, Guido and Arnaut are content with impersonal psalmody, but the pilgrim on his re- turn to the world must reach a network of invisible readers, as he himself was reached by Guinizelli's "dolci detti." Thus, in a tribute running counter to the penitential moto spiritale of transcending the flesh, the pilgrim expresses quasi-idolatrous reverence for Guido's writing in its material aspect, praising verses which, as long as the 41 The penitents exchanging a kiss of peace commune directly with one another and are polar opposites to Jason or the unreconstructed Arnaut. Indeed, the ac- companying simile of ants rubbing muzzles recalls the angel communicants rather than subrational beasts of De Vulg. I, ii, 2-6, for Dante's ants trade information of "lor via e lor fortuna." 42 Cf. Giuseppe Mazzotta's comments on poetic filiation in Dante, Poet of the Desert (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1979), pp. 216-19.</page><page sequence="34">34 RICHARD ABRAMS vernacular lasts, "faranno cari ancora i loro incostri" (XXVI, 114). The letter inheres in the word, the corporeal signifier in the spir- itual signified, as an alloy rather than dross, extending the word's life in the world long after its author's voice is stilled. Like his native Italian which Dante loved for uniting his parents, so the corporeal medium which introduced him to his spiritual father is cherished. The pilgrim's reverence for Guido's inkmarks is regressive, yet this is permissible nostalgia like Carlo Martello's in the Sphere of Venus rather than Casella's. Consonant with a theology allowing for the body's resurrection along with the soul, the letter as "vestigio" (106) is viewed as the spirit's complement, worthy of respect. Writing for Dante is not just a disease of speech, then, to be healed along with the last wound. Because it is of the body, the letter partakes of human mortality and incompleteness, but also it possesses the body's generative potency, like the sexual organs which Bernard Sylvester hailed as twin genii gallantly battling death with daemonic weapons to insure the perpetuation of the race.43 The penitents, because they are dead, can afford to purge tex- tuality as the living pilgrim and future epic poet cannot. The dif- ferent laws under which the living and dead operate are under- scored by the two forms of "indication" framing the canto. Arnaut, a spirit pointed out by another spirit, no longer desires to dwell on the page and goes forth singing ("vau cantan"). But the flesh- and-blood pilgrim, pointed out by his own shadow, must return to the world and go on writing (cf. Canto XXIV's "vo significando"). He is trapped in a closed system of significations where words acquire meaning only by pointing to other words, as a marginal manicula is pre-eminently a signifier of other signifiers. No isolated lyric effusion but only a sustained writing effort can authenticate Dante's prophetic mission, and writing thereby gains dignity to which Guinizelli attests when, in a long speech, he conspicuously reverses the canto's earlier ranking of the spoken word over the written. Three times near the end of Canto XXV and twice again in XXVI the verb gridare denotes the penitents' pious proclamation of instances of lust and chastity (XXV, 128, 130, 134; XXVI, 48, 79). But after Guido's and the pilgrim's dangling conversation and just before Arnaut's final declamation, Dante inserts a speech longer than Arnaut's, interrupted only by brief stage directions, in 43 Stock, Myth and Science, pp. 217-18.</page><page sequence="35">M L N 35 which Guido gains full voice. Passionately discussing the ironies of poetic reputation, Guido affirms the brilliance of the wordsmith Arnaut and overturns the rating of voice over sign, employing "grido" in a pejorative sense contrasting with five earlier uses. Of the fools who prefer Borneil ("quel di Lemosi") and Guittone to Arnaut we hear: A voce piui ch'al ver drizzan 1i volti, e cosi ferman sua oppinione prima ch'arte o ragione per lor s'ascolti. Cosi fer molti antichi di Guittone, di grido in grido pur lui dando pregio, fin che iha vinto il ver con piu persone. (121-26) Implicitly associated with vedere, "[i]l ver" is accessible only to those who judge by art or reason, not those who judge on the basis of "voce" or "grido," rumor or loose talk.44 Thus Arnaut, writing for the page and posterity, may be judged only by those with the finest reading habits. Though writing may no longer matter to souls on the road to unmediated knowledge of God, it serves as a bulwark against human mutability. All worldly things including language are subject to change, as Dante acknowledges in his tribute to Gui- nizelli ("quanto durera l'uso moderno") and Adam reiterates. But writing retards change. With page and ink as its flesh-and-blood, human intelligence may endure through the ages, performing a quasi-providential function of stabilizing earthly affairs. Dante affirms the sacred poem's corporeal or graphic dimen- sion, then, as he affirms the body's relative goodness and the ne- cessity of living in the world. More, his moderated view of sen- suality carries implications for the Comedy's poetics in a second sphere. By considering writing as a special case of representation through which the poet gives apparent presence to things absent, we extend our argument into the realm of the sign and poetic fictions generally. Already in De Vulgari Dante anticipates this ma- ture development of his thought. Describing language's twin graces as sapor and venustas (DVE, I, vi, 4-5), he employs a division cor- responding to the two grades of libido, gluttony and lust, purged on Purgatory's highest slopes. By sapor Dante means the flavor imparted to language by inversion of normal sentence order, by venustas the charm imparted by poetic figures. And though sexual 44 Cf. Singleton, Purg.: Comm., pp. 644-45, note to verse 125.</page><page sequence="36">36 RICHARD ABRAMS connotations rarely attended venustas in classical Latin usage, its present coupling with sapor argues a revived etymological force. To view the image as a sensual manifestation of thought is com- monplace, but over and above this commonplace Dante seems to imply the image's specific appeal to the sexual imagination. Poetic images are fetching, sexy; they seduce us visually. Whatever else is true about this synaesthetic notion which Dante leaves unex- plained, it clearly coincides with Purgatory's treatment of lust as a sin of the eyes. Of the process of seduction by visual figures Canto XXVII provides an example suggestive of Dante's poetic practice in the Commedia. The angel of the terrace bids the pilgrim enter the flames but Dante hesitates, lacking moral confidence to act on the angel's command. "[Q]uel d'Adamo," corresponding to the penitents' yet- unpurged sensuality, which throughout his journey has caused Dante to fear for his flesh, now operates eidetically in him. His fear translates itself into images; "imaginando forte umani corpi gia' veduti accesi" (XXVII, 17-18), he stands immobilized. But Virgil suggests an alternative false image to counteract the pil- grim's irrelevant recollections of burnt bodies. "'Or vedi, figlio,'" he reasons," 'tra Beatrice e te e questo muro'" (35-36). Pandering to Dante's desire "come al fanciul si fa ch'e vinto al pome" (45), Virgil lures Dante into the flames, discoursing of Beatrice all the way till they reach the other side. " 'Li occhi suoi gia' veder parmi' " (54), he attests in a foreshadowing bella menzogna which colors the truth with a fiction, as the shadow revealed the flame's true color by blocking the main light-source. False representation cancels false representation; Beatrice's conjured eyes litotically annul the pilgrim's hallucinations of burnt corpses. Though Dante, subject to mortality, cannot enter the fire "sicuro" as Virgil bids (32), yet Virgil plays off the flesh against the flesh, pandering to Dante's frailty by proffering as "pome" a phantasm of sensual beauty. The apple simile is significant. Man lost the garden through erring desire, but Virgil, appealing with a figurative apple to "quel d'A- damo" in the pilgrim, lures Dante back to the Earthly Paradise, repeating on a plane of symbolic action, apple canceling apple, the trope of litotes.45 Because the mortal pilgrim fears for his flesh, it 45 For the "pome" as originary of false desire, Conv.

Beatrice's con- jured eyes, leading the pilgrim through a metaphorical wall of fire, balance Me- dusa's excessive pulchritude which stalls him at a literal wall, preventing his entry into "la cittA del foco" in Inf. IX. Cf. n. 17, above.</page><page sequence="37">M L N 37 is useless to appeal to reason. The futility of this approach was demonstrated on entry to the terrace when Dante's "cura" or anx- iety about the flames clouded his desire to listen and learn. But by appealing to the pilgrim's affections, Virgil, bypassing reason, completes the pilgrim's lesson. Leading Dante through the fire with a bella menzogna, he reveals the fire's safety and consequently God's power to suspend physical law. Now, an obvious function of the episode of Dante's temptation into the fire is to recapitulate Virgil's role as guide shortly before Virgil's disappearance from the poem. Hailing Virgil as "Poeta che mi guidi" (Inf. II, 10), Dante makes clear from the start that Virgil's fitness to lead derives from his poetic gift. In that first meeting Virgil conquers Dante's trepidation by painting a word-picture of Beatrice poignantly soliciting aid in the pilgrim's behalf (52-72, esp. 55); and about to vanish, Virgil repeats this act of word-painting, conjuring absent Beatrice to eyes of flesh. Moreover, the episode of Virgil guiding by verbal art caps the sequence of interviews with five poets from Statius to Arnaut, with the effect that Dante finally reveals in his own maestro and autore poetry's proper use. To show the sense in which Dante himself in composing the Commedia takes over the fictional Virgil's strategy, leading forth his readers with images possessing venustas, I must draw into discussion a further passage. Virgil's ploy with its rationale of honorable pandery may be compared to Beatrice's famous explanation of accommodative metaphor in Paradiso IV. In the often-quoted passage of Paradiso Beatrice tells how Scrip- ture, by defining spiritual essences corporeally, accommodates human intelligence which depends on sensibilia (Par. IV, 40-45). Her emphasis falls on the sign's cognitive content, whereas the Virgil episode emphasizes the sign's appeal to desire in a manner suiting its placement after the canto of lust. This difference aside, however, the two passages reveal obvious similarity; both feature the strategy of leading forth (educating) through the representa- tion of absent beings (in the first case, Beatrice who is said to wait on the fire's far side; in the second, the whole spiritual realm). Furthermore, Beatrice's bridge to the famous passage on metaphor is her discussion of a related kind of figuration likewise promi- nently featured in Dante's treatment of lust. As a prelude to ex- plaining the Church or Scripture's condescension to fantasy with corporeal images, she tells of the blessed souls' charitable self-man- ifestation to the pilgrim on leaving their seats in the Empyrean</page><page sequence="38">38 RICHARD ABRAMS "per far segno" of their various conditions of beatitude. This ex- planation of how the blessed souls take on appearance recalls the process sketched by Statius in which the souls of the unpurged dead inscribe their being in air. Just before Dante announces his arrival on the seventh terrace, Statius sums up his lecture on aerial bodies by remarking, "'Secondo che ci affliggono i disiri ... l'ombra si figura'" (106-07). Thus Dante's sojourn among the lustful is bracketed by the two forms of figuration later invoked by Beatrice in identical sequence. Moreover, Statius' verb figurare recurs in the shades' description of their own aerial forms when, differentiating themselves from the pilgrim, they observe, "'Colui non par corpo fittizio,'" and though this use of "fittizio" is generally excluded from discussions of Dante's concept of poetic fiction, the strong analogy between the spirits shaping themselves in air and the other kind of figuration-the representation of that which lacks a body, lacks presence (as Beatrice is not really on the far side of the flames at the precise moment Virgil tells of seeing her)-prompts its con- sideration therein.46 The corpi in the afterworld are fittizii in a double sense: incorporeal, shadowy, and also, perhaps, fictitious, not really there. Whereas a lyric poem's venustas is its figural or- namentation, the epic Comedy's venustas lies in its ability to make visible to imagination a cast of unreal characters. Like the schemata ornamenting the carmenfigurativum, the poet's dramatis personae, especially "anime che son di fame note" (Par. XVII, 138), seduce the reader, causing him to fix his faith till this corporeally initiated commitment converts itself to a true love of moral virtue.47 For two canticles Dante has made sensually vivid the troop of souls he claims to have met in Hell and Purgatory, yet after meeting Beatrice he will alter his poetic procedure, affording the blessed souls met in the form of radiances in Paradise greater distance and dignity. Can it be that, on the eve of this change, he prepares to give up, by "confessing," his earlier representational tactic, much in the way that Singleton showed Dante demystifying the personification Amor just before the love-god's retreat from the narrative of La vita nuova? In retrospect Virgil's conjuring up of Beatrice looks like a recapitulation not only of his function as guide, but of Dante's art of poetically realizing, by pseudo-corpo- realizing, the souls of the two earthly realms. More, as Virgil's airy 46 The sequence "figura" (as a noun)/"fittizie parole," anticipating Statius' "si fi- gura" and the penitents' "corpo fittizio," occurs in Conv. II, xii, 8. 47 Cf. fermarfede in Par. XVII, 140 with fermar oppinione in Purg. XXVI, 122.</page><page sequence="39">MLN 39 conjuration of absent Beatrice complements Statius' description of souls imprinting the air, so "fittizio," glancing Janus-like between two kinds of figuration (the discorporate souls' self-presentation, poetic representation), plays its two meanings off against each other; the assertion of real (aerial) figuration is undermined by the hint that the souls who stamp their being in air may after all be fictive. Looking out from the flames, the shades marvel at Dante's physical presence and certify that presence; they attest that Dante has truly visited the afterworld, as he has reported for two canticles. But the shades word their testimony, "'Colui non par corpo fittizio,' " in an odd way that all but discloses their own fictive status, so that in the very act of affirming the pilgrim's presence they undercut their own, opening to the reader's speculation the precise sense in which they exist as corpi fittizii. This moment when the fictional veil is briefly rent is structured like the magnificent simile in the last canto of Paradiso in which the oblivion following Dante's vision of God is compared to the twenty-five centuries since the fictional Neptune gaped at man's audacity, the shadow of the Argo crossing his seas (Par. XXXIII, 94-96). The simile plays chiastically on the relations of god (super- real deity, mythic Neptune) and man (Dante, Jason), teasing us out of thought with its transposition of elements-the role of gazer passing from the human voyager (Dante) to the marveling god (Neptune). So too the canto of lust presents corpifittizii who are at once less and more real than the pilgrim-poet at whom they stare in wonder. Rising to a shadow, as Neptune rose to a shadow, they are themselves like the shadow that stirs their imaginations; for the similarity of the ombre rendered sensually vivid by the poet's art, and the pilgrim's ombra which renders the fire vivid, is stressed by the juxtaposition of the word's two senses in the same terzina: e io facea con l'ombra piui rovente parer la fiamma; e pur a tanto indizio vidi molt' ombre andando, poner mente. (XXVI, 7-9; emphasis added) Like Dante's projected shadow, the shades who owe their being to the other kind of figuration (poetic representation) will function as Beatrices for the reader's corporeal imagination, drawing us to- ward contemplation of things divine by appealing to "quel d'A- damo" in our flesh. If these personages are in one sense fictitious, produced by the poet's cutting off of the light of truth, then they</page><page sequence="40">40 RICHARD ABRAMS are in a double sense truer than what we normally accept as real: for as shades they are, on the poem's literal level, fully expressive, incapable of hiding deception within their aerial bodies; and per allegoria they afford the reader contemplative access to God's eternal judgment. Like the fire deprived of light, they become more lustrous for the fact of coming into being in a state of fictional contingency. From the image of the shadow on the flames begetting beauty, one might even argue that Dante's essential gesture as a writer of fictional epic is his blocking of the light to let the truth emerge in stages-a necessary intercourse with the world's darkness and falsehood till further "umbriferi prefazii" are no longer required to prepare us for the Beatific Vision. But the risk of such an ar- gument is great, and in the space remaining I can do little more than indicate the general compatibility of my reading of the canto of lussuriosi with a recent trend in Dante criticism. The question of the status of the primary level of the narrative-whether a bella menzogna functioning as the basis of an "allegory of poets," or in some sense a truth functioning as the literal level in an "allegory of theologians"-has long been in dispute. However, in a recent essay Paul Priest persuasively argues "that the Commedia has to be an 'allegory of poets,' but since the two modes are so closely related, it serves the purposes of the 'allegory of theologians' just as well when openly recognized as a poetic fiction; and perhaps even better."48 If Priest's argument, which reconciles such seemingly antithetical accounts of the poem as Charles Singleton's and David Thompson's, gains currency, it should be easier to countenance the fugitive second meaning of a phrase like "corpo fittizio" which momentarily subverts the poetic fiction, revealing the poem's literal level to be a bella menzogna, and so rivets the reader with a fasci- nation akin to erotic fascination. As in a striptease, the fabric briefly gapes. Just after Dante notes the flame's restored bright- ness, the ombre, by way of verifying the pilgrim's real presence, let slip that they may be no more than projections of his dreaming mind, as his shadow is a projection of his body. Then the veil closes again, the narrative moves forward along its main track. Erotic experience presents the chronic difficulty of distinguishing one's projected alterity, one's phantasms or imagos, from the beloved's truly separate otherness. But though the spirits are "really there" in the fiction of the poem, what remains shadowy, portentous, is 48 Priest, "Allegory and Reality in the Commedia," Dante Studies, 96 (1978), p. 127.</page><page sequence="41">MLN 41 the substance of every vision and semblance short of the Beatific Vision itself. In Priest's interpretation of scriptural culture, the Books of Nature and History are themselves belle menzogne instinct with God's self-disclosing presence, so that Dante, imitating these Books in his Commedia, produces a bella menzogna which, like the world itself, is faintly real and faintly unreal, constituting in its unreality a seduction to the beyond. "If this is the spirit of Dante's allegory," writes Priest, "we should expect that the 'ultimate reality' [Dante] is allowed to see at the end of his journey has been sha- dowily present all through it." 49Whether those real-things-as- shadows are generated by the poet's fictions obscuring the light, or by Love which, derogating from eternal brightness, creates the world, they attest not to an antithetical principle of darkness or evil in the universe, but to the God who "made darkness his covert, and pavilion round about him." Seemingly perverse in his homage to sexuality's dark beauty, Dante resembles the Psalmist who, re- membering the God dwelling in darkness, makes his prayer, "Quoniam tu illuminas lucernam meam, Domine; Deus meus, illuminas tenebras meas" (Douay, Ps. 17:29).
