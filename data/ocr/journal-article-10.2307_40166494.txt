<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning5 in the Vita Nuova) GREGORY B. STONE Omne quod recipitur in aliquo, recipitur per modum recipientis, et non per modum sui. [Everything that is received by someone is received after the fashion of the recipient and not after its own fashion.] - Thomas Aquinas "The truth is that which is agreed upon at the time of the agreement, and as long as the agreement lasts." - attributed by Plato to Protagoras Vita Nuova's first poem, as everyone knows and as Dante tells us in the prose that immediately precedes it, describes a dream of Dante's and poses a hermeneutic challenge to his peers, calling upon some noted poets to respond in verse with their notions of the dream's correct interpretation: Pensando io a cio che m'era apparuto, propuosi di farlo sentire a molti li quali erano famosi trovatori in quello tempo: e con cio fosse cosa che io avesse gia vedu- to per me medisimo l'arte del dire parole per rima, propuosi di fare uno sonetto, ne Io quale io salutasse tutti li fedeli d'Amore; e pregandoli che giudicassero la mia visione, scrissi a loro cio che io avea nel mio sonno veduto.1 There is no need, for the purposes of this essay, to dwell at any length on the particulars of Dante's dream: suffice it to say that Dante sees Love car- rying the sleeping Beatrice, who, wrapped in a sheet, awakens and begins to eat Dante's disembodied heart, after which Love and Beatrice ascend 133</page><page sequence="2">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 toward Heaven. My aim here is not to propose another interpretation of the dream, but rather to consider the implied hermeneutic theory formulated in the Vita Nuoua - a theory which approaches, as shall become clear in the latter portion of this essay, a radical subjectivism according to which there is no such thing as the universally true meaning of a text. But our initial question is: according to Dante, has the dream been correctly interpreted?2 Dante tells us that his challenge was accepted by several poets, resulting in a diverse plurality of proposed interpretations: "A questo sonetto fue risposto da molti e di diverse sentenzie" ("This sonnet drew replies from many, who suggested various meanings99).3 Indeed, some of these various responses are known to us, including Dante da Maiano's declaration that the dream and the sonnet are meaningless (a position embraced by some recent critics, as we shall see below) and his wonderful (and, to us, hilar- ious) suggestion that if only Dante would wash his testicles better he would not have such nonsensical visions.4 Yet, as Dante goes on to tell us, none of these initial interpretations of his dream - not even that offered by the subtle and most intelligent Cavalcanti - revealed "the true meaning" (lo verace giudicio): "Lo verace giudicio del detto sogno non fue veduto allora per alcuno" ("The true meaning of the dream was not then perceived by anyone"). Dante claims that his text (the dream/sonnet) was initially incomprehensible, both to its author and to its first audience. But the sentence which I have just cited continues, and, read in its entirety, seems to declare that, though the dream was not at the outset understood, its true meaning eventually became and now remains obvi- ous to even the least subtle and intelligent of readers: "Lo verace giudicio del detto sogno non fue veduto allora per alcuno, ma ora e manifestissimo a lipiu semplici" ("The true meaning of the dream was not then perceived by anyone, but now it is perfectly clear to the simplest persons99). Here, at the end of the Vita Nuova9s third chapter, Dante appears to bear witness to a tempo- ral or historical hermeneutic "progress": the passage of time is also the passage from a diverse plurality of incorrect readings (diverse sentenzie) to the singular correct one (lo verace giudicio). Once, then, in the past, no one could fathom Dante's text; now, in the present, even the greatest simple- ton can understand it. Here I shall engage in a brief digression. Dante's notion of a hermeneutic "progress," of temporality or the unfolding of history as a necessary condition for interpretation, of a difference between a then (the 134</page><page sequence="3">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuovaj, GREGORY B. stone time of the text's first appearance) when the text is unreadable and a now (a later age) when the text's secrets are disclosed - such a notion poses a serious challenge to the project of any well-intentioned modern-day medievalist who believes that the essence of his or her task is imagina- tively to reconstruct the then, to recreate the "original proper context" in which dwells the text's true meaning. Such medievalists maintain that we would properly understand medieval texts if only we could think as if we lived in the Middle Ages. This is, in fact, Charles Singleton's position in the "Foreword" to An Essay on the "Vita Nuova": Dante's libello is not understood by us because we are not medievals; it is more correctly, though somewhat incorrectly, understood by a certain sixteenth-century Florentine editor, because he lived closer to the time and place of its ori- gin; if we lived in the original proper context, if we were one of Dante's Florentine contemporaries, we would correctly understand his text.5 Singleton's view clearly posits that there is a hermeneutic "decline" as the text endures, as history unfolds: the more remote we are from the origin, the more remote our sense of the text is from its correct interpretation (lo veracegiudicio). Singleton and a multitude of other fine medievalists maintain that the medieval text is most properly interpreted in the proper context, at the time and in the place of its origin. If we were one of the author's famil- iars - better yet, if we were the author himself- then we would immedi- ately and instinctively pronounce lo verace giudicio. For such medievalists, the aim of our studies is to say about the medieval text what its author and its first audience would have said. But this is precisely not what Dante says here at the end of the Vita Nuova1 s third chapter. What Dante would have said (and what he in fact says) is that, when the text is initially composed, in its "original context," its first audience has no idea what it means: even his Florentine contemporary, his most intimate familiar, his primo amico and first reader Cavalcanti fails to understand. What is more, Dante himself does not originally, immediately, intuitively understand his own words. What Dante says here is that to go right back to the origin, to the original time and place of the text's genesis - even better, to get right inside the author's head at the time of the text's composition - is to enter a context in which the text is incomprehensible, meaningless. The medievalist who embraces Singleton's position concerning our obligation to read the medieval text in its original proper context is inevitably forced into a paradoxical trap: we must say what the medievals 135</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 would have said about the text when it was originally composed, but what the medievals in fact said, over and over, is that no one who lives and reads at the time and in the place of the text's origin - not even the author - is in a position to understand the text properly. Dante's claim that correct interpretation depends upon something like differance, upon the reader's temporal and spatial alienation from the original utterance, belongs to a venerable tradition of medieval hermeneutics - a tradition according to which neither author nor original audience possesses special knowledge concerning lo verace giudicio. Other notable formulations and variations of this hermeneutic include Augustine's repeated claims that the aim of reading is not to reveal the author's original intentions but rather to for- mulate something pragmatically useful to the reader and his or her com- munity;6 Gregory the Great's assertion that "Holy Scripture grows with all those who read it";7 Thomas Aquinas's anticipation of the entire foun- dation of twentieth-century "reception theory" in his statement that "whatever is received by someone is received after the fashion of the recipient";8 Marie de France's famous claim in the "Prologue" to her Lais that the ancient writers could not understand what they wrote, that their texts were initially obscure and thus that it is the task of later generations of more subtle readers to supply their own interpretations; Saint Bonaventure's less famous claim that much of the New Testament was meaningless to its original audience, to anyone living in the time and place of Christ (and that the meaning of Scripture is constantly, as history unfolds, undergoing a virtually infinite growth, resulting in a radically multiplicitous dissemination of senses);9 Boccaccio's suggestion at the end of the Decameron that, in matters concerning his lingua, his "tongue" or "language" or, let us say, his text, he himself is no authority, that if we want some knowledge of such matters we should ask someone else;10 the trou- badour Marcabru's avowal that his poems are so obscure that he has no idea what he is talking about.11 In brief, whatever else this final sentence of the Vita Nuova's third chapter signifies, it manifestly signifies that nei- ther Dante nor his contemporaries who comprise his first audience can immediately or intuitively understand his text, that neither the author nor those who dwell in the "proper context," in the original time and place, are the proper authorities for determining validity in interpretation. We are authorized by the medieval text to maintain that, when it comes to questions concerning its true meaning, the medievals themselves are not necessarily the proper authorities of whom we should inquire. 136</page><page sequence="5">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning9 in the Vita Nuova), GREGORY B. stone Let us return to our primary question, which concerns whether or not the true interpretation (lo verace giudicio) of Dante's dream has been revealed. We recall that Dante seems unambiguously to declare that the matter of the dream's meaning has been definitively settled: "Lo verace giudicio del detto sogno . . . ora e manifestissimo a li piu semplici" ("The true meaning of the dream . . . now is perfectly clear to the simplest read- er"). The problem which this declaration poses for modern readers is that, to us, the dream's true significance is not at all immediately obvious. In fact, modern criticism has not reached a consensus that would allow us to pronounce a single verace giudicio. Are we, perhaps less equipped to under- stand than even the simplest medieval reader, missing something? How do we moderns, who remain somewhat in the dark concerning the dream's correct interpretation, accept without embarrassment Dante's assertion that the dream's meaning is obvious even to the greatest simple- tons? There have been, as far as I know, two types of response to this ques- tion. The first is the response of Singleton and his epigones. Such critics, motivated in part by a faith in Dante's infallibility, attempt to demonstrate that Dante's assertion is right, that the dream's true meaning is indeed obvious even to the simplest reader. If the correct interpretation seems less than obvious to us, the responsibility for this obscurity is not Dante's but ours: we are too much estranged from the original proper context in which the true meaning is perfectly clear.12 Furthermore, the Singletonian view maintains that there is such a thing as lo verace giudico, as the (lo) true meaning, a singular correct interpretation of the dream. Of all the many signifiers or details which comprise the dream's manifest appearance, there is one which Singleton singles out and deems "the most significant." To interpret this detail correctly is tantamount to disclosing what Singleton calls the dream's "true meaning." Specifically, Singleton claims that, since at the end of Dante's dream Love, weeping, ascends with Beatrice toward heaven, then the dream's true meaning is "Beatrice's death." For Singleton, positing that the dream means "Beatrice's death" allows us to understand and to accept Dante's declaration that, though the dream was not then understood by anyone, now its sense is perfectly manifest to the simplest reader. Singleton sees the dream as prophetic, as making sense only with the passage of time (and this despite his general assertion that we can only retrieve the meaning of the Vita Nuova by going back to 137</page><page sequence="6">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 the time of its origin). Dante's dream prefigures an event (Beatrice's death) that in fact does not take place until later in the chronology of his Book of Memory. Only after Dante experiences this event does the dream's true meaning become obvious to him, and only after the reader reaches this later point in the Vita Nuova does that verace giudicio become perfectly obvious to the reader. Dante's strategy is thus to imitate, by anal- ogy, the temporal scheme of Scripture: just as the dream's true signifi- cance remains obscure until Beatrice's death, so too the true meaning of certain (if not all) passages in the Old Testament remains obscure until Christ's death (Singleton himself compares Dante's dream with certain prophetic moments in the Gospels: then, when Christ foretold His death, none of His disciples understood; now, after Christ has died, the prophet- ic import of those utterances is perfectly obvious to everyone).13 Singleton argues that, if the dream has remained somewhat incomprehensible to us moderns, this is because we are no longer sufficiently Christian to under- stand Dante's strategy of imitating Scripture. Fortunately, after Singleton's work, lo verace giudicio has been revealed anew: the single true meaning of Dante's dream will be perfectly obvious to anyone who reads An Essay on the "Vita Nuova". Again, the Singletonian position is that Dante's assertion is right, that the dream's single true meaning is obvious (provided that one's thinking is sufficiently Christian to perceive what even the simplest of Dante's contemporaries must have perceived). Several recent critics have challenged the Singletonian position that posits lo verace giudicio, the singular true sense or correct interpretation of Dante's dream. Despite Singleton's powerful reading, a plurality of plau- sible alternative readings has been and continues to be produced, and the very existence of this plurality of diverse sentenzie ("various meanings") alone proves that the true meaning is not perfectly obvious. Here I shall just mention in passing one of several competing interpretations, which in its way is just as "perfectly obvious" as Singleton's Christological one. Dante's dream is an erotic wish-fulfillment fantasy, the manifest yet oblique expression of a latent desire that, repressed, has been subjected to what Freud calls Entstellung, distortion and displacement: if in the mani- fest dream it is Love, in Dante's latent fantasy it is Dante who embraces the nearly naked Beatrice; if in the manifest dream Beatrice eats Dante's heart, in his latent fantasy she "eats" his penis, etc.14 Dante's assertion that even the greatest simpleton can perceive his dream's correct interpretation is dubious not merely because there 138</page><page sequence="7">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuovaj, GREGORY B. stone remains a diverse plurality of possible interpretations but also because much of the dream's significance is demonstrably hidden, occulted, arcane. That is, even if Singleton were right, and the dream's true mean- ing were entirely Christological, still it would be difficult to say, as Dante says, that this meaning is manifestissimo ("manifest," "perfectly obvious," "completely clear"). For, if anything about the dream is clear, it is that the dream is not immediately clear, its significance is not manifest, not super- ficial, not plainly there on the surface - the dream, that is, signifies much more than it appears, on first sight, to signify. As numerous critics have shown, the manifest dream generates or produces a vast latent network of intertextual allusions. Recent criticism, then, recognizing both the dream's semiotic density or richness (the arcane nature of its significance) and its diverse plurality of plausible sentenzie, have maintained, contra Singleton, that Dante's asser- tion is wrong, that the dream's true meaning is not perfectly clear to every- one.15 Of course, when a dantista says that Dante is wrong, it is a sure bet that he or she is saying that Dante is consciously wrong: Dante knows that lo verace giudicio is not perfectly manifest even to the most sophisticated of readers, let alone to the most simple, yet he teases or bluffs us into think- ing that it may be so. Let us look at a few of the more noteworthy recent readings of Dante's dream in greater detail. For Susan Noakes, the dream is massively overde- termined, supersaturated with significance:16 Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find in earlier Italian literature more than a few texts that require a comparable effort to begin to understand them than does this initial portion of the Vita Nuova. The dream narrative of chapter Hi and Dante's accompanying commentary on it constitute an astoundingly complex network of double entendres and biblical allusions. De Robertis's notes alone point out the following: "something liturgical" in the symbolism of the lady's dress (and De Robertis's language in the note on it makes clear that he does not know what precisely this symbolism means, though he is hardly among "li piu semplici"); a seeming resonance of setting with the transfiguration of Christ (Mark 9:2-7; Matt. 17:2-5); a contrast between grace and merit typical of Scripture and especially of the Psalms; an image originating in Jeremiah 23:9; a description from Ezekiel 8:12; a possible correspondence to a vision in Apocalypse 10:1; a direct citation of the words ofYahweh in beginning the enun- ciation of the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:2; an expression based on Psalms 37:23 and 87:12; another particularly mysterious one possibly related to Psalms 9:14 or 138:23, or to Lamentations 1:9; a citation from the Epistle of James 4:9; 139</page><page sequence="8">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 and finally a source for chapter ill's very last sentence in John 12:16. Perfectly clear to the simplest? Not very likely. According to Noakes, the dream's "true meaning" (Dante's aim in inscribing it into his Hbello) is nothing other than its extreme overdeter- mination, its great plurality of senses: its meaning is that it is meaningful - that is, full of meaning. Noakes maintains that Dante's aim is not to commu- nicate any one single or specific sense but rather to attribute to his text (the dream and the sonnet) a general aura of semantic richness. Dante's aim, that is, is to display the fact that his love poetry is "more learned, more rhetorical, more theological, more philosophical" than previous love poetry in the troubadour tradition.17 The point of such a display is to show that vernacular writing can be just as meaningful, just as complicated, just as worthy of the exegete's attention, as Latin writing. Dante intentionally commences his Hbello with a text whose significance is not obvious to the simplest reader in order to suggest that readers of certain vernacular texts may form a "hermeneutic elite": as Dante knows, few are those readers who understand him, and those few have worked hard to achieve that understanding. For Noakes, then, the dream is part of the Vita Nuova's overall purpose of inventing "the new concept of lay literature" - the idea of a literature that, although written in the mother tongue, demands the same degree of informed commentary as does the Aeneid and Scripture.18 In his excellent book The Body of Beatrice Robert Pogue Harrison also claims that Dante is consciously aware, despite his own proclamation to the contrary, that the dream's true meaning remains undisclosed. For Harrison, Dante's declaration that lo verace giudicio "now is manifest to even the most simple-minded" ("ora e manifestissimo a li piu semplici") is a bluff, meant to provoke us into interpreting a text whose true signifi- cance has never yet been revealed: "By making such a statement and yet refusing to disclose the dream's 'true meaning' for his reader, Dante seems deliberately to have preserved for us the dream's most essential quality, namely, its hermeneutic provocation."19 But whereas for Noakes the dream's true meaning is that it is meaningful, for Harrison its meaning is that its meaning will never be unveiled. This becomes clear in Harrison's argument concerning "the body of Beatrice," a phrase which signifies, among other things, something very much like "signified" or "true mean- ing" (as is clear in the following remark, in which Harrison explicitly posits an equation between "the body of Beatrice" and "meaning": "The 140</page><page sequence="9">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuova,), GREGORY B. stone correlation I am proposing between the body of Beatrice and intendimen- to, or meaning . . ."20). Now, for Harrison, the most significant detail of Dante's dream is that Beatrice's naked body (i.e., "meaning") is not revealed in its absolute nakedness but rather remains veiled in a drappo sanguigno. Harrison, then, reads the dream as a deconstructive allegory: we will never have a pure or unmediated vision of meaning-in-itself, that is, of a meaning that is not somehow altered or distorted by its linguistic rep- resentation. In Harrison's words: "the body of Beatrice remains the undisclosed substance of revelation. . . . The body of Beatrice ... is never phenomenally accessible in itself."21 Again, this means that signified meaning or lo verace giudicio (the body of Beatrice) is never fully revealed or disclosed, but rather such meaning is always to some degree masked by the signifier, by linguistic representation (the veil or drappo sanguigno). Harrison insists that the true meaning of the dream is nothing other than our blindness to its true meaning: we interpret the dream correctly only when we see that it is about the impossibility of correct interpretation, only when we see that we will never have an unmediated vision of its meaning, only when we see that we will never see the body of Beatrice. If according to Noakes the meaning of Dante's dream is that it is mean- ingful and according to Harrison its meaning is that its meaning will never be revealed, according to Maria Rosa Menocal's extremely convincing reading its meaning is that it is meaningless?2 Menocal's position is not some naive deconstructive one which would simply posit that the Vita Nuova, insofar as it is a species of the genus "literature," must therefore have no meaning; quite to the contrary, she shows that the meaning of the Vita Nuova (Dante's aim or purpose in composing it) is the claim that Dante's authentic verse (that which is written after the "discovery" of the dolce stil nuovo) is, especially when considered in opposition to the meaningless ("meaningless" according to Dante, not according to Menocal) verse of the troubadours, extremely meaningful. In other words, Menocal sees the Vita Nuova as the story of Dante's youthful attachment to the troubadour lyric tradition - the poetics of which is no more than an empty formalism, a fetishization of the play of signifiers with no reference to signified mean- ings (again, this is Dante's conception of the troubadours, not so much Menocal's and definitely not my own23) - followed by Dante's conversion to or founding of a new lyric tradition (the "Sweet New Style") in which signified meanings are primary and precede their representation by signi- fiers. Menocal argues that Dante came to regard troubadour poetry - and, 141</page><page sequence="10">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 in particular, the poetry of Arnaut Daniel, who practiced such Provencal manners as the trobar clus (a "closed," obscure or difficult poetry which resists interpretation) and the trobar ric (a poetry of "rich" or intricate rhyme-schemes that often appears to have nothing much to say) - as being all style and no substance, all form and no content, all signifier and no signified. It is as an element of this general interpretation of the Vita Nuova that Menocal reads Dante's dream, which she sees as Dante's conscious ana- logue to or emblem of troubadour poetry: like the trobar clus, the dream seems to mean a lot, seems to refer to certain signified meanings, but in fact it is just nonsense, a pure cacophony of signifiers; like the trobar ric, the dream has a surface beauty but really has nothing to say Thus, Dante's apparent statement that the dream has an obvious true meaning must be ironic, indeed must be wrong: The first "obvious" interpretation, then, is that the author's statement ... is sub- tly ironic: what is obvious to him when he has buried the poetics of Love [i.e., troubadour poetry] is precisely that the dream has no meaning - certainly no "clear" meaning. One can, of course, point to all sorts of the bits and pieces of the dream that are true and that are interpretable: the color symbolism, the mysteri- ous Latin, the burning heart, and so forth. . . . One can, in fact, construct a num- ber of more or less elaborate and more or less sophisticated interpretations of the dream - but none that is or would have been transparent and obvious, let alone to the most simple. The only thing that is transparent and obvious, especially to the simple, is that the vision qua vision - or qua prophetic dream - is a garbled one. Inevitably, the poem written to reflect the incoherent vision is able to be formally lovely without shedding any light, any meaning, on the puzzle of the dream vison. . . . Finally, it is imperative to note that this is an incoherence that Dante as author is ascribing to a poetic history which he has clearly renounced for himself.24 In sum, Menocal argues that Dante intentionally renders the dream inco- herent or meaningless in order to represent the incoherence or meaning- lessness which Dante ascribes to troubadour poetry and which he later claims to have surpassed.25 Menocal's reading of the dream insists on the irony of Dante's claim that its meaning is manifestissimo: the dream's sig- nificance is in fact superlatively manifest - that is, there is nothing "behind" or "hidden below" its surface, nothing to it other than what you are able to see, no latent signified content to be extracted, uncovered, or revealed, nothing behind the veil, no "body of Beatrice" waiting there. So far I have suggested that those readers who have responded to the 142</page><page sequence="11">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuova), GREGORY B. STONE challenge posed by phrase "ma ora e manifestissimo a li piu semplici" ("but now it is perfectly clear to the simplest") may be divided into two camps: those like Singleton who say that Dante is right, and those like Noakes, Harrison, and Menocal who say that Dante is wrong, when he says that the dream's correct interpretation or true meaning is perfectly clear to the simplest reader. Now, despite their opposition, the partisans of these two camps share a fundamental premise. Whether they think the dream's significance is, as Dante seems to claim, obvious and clear or whether they think it is any- thing but obvious and clear, they all agree on the clarity or obviousness of this claim for clarity and obviousness: there is no dispute over the literal or gram- matical sense of the phrase "Lo verace giudicio . . . ora e manifestissimo a li piu semplici" ("now the true interpretation is perfectly obvious to the simplest"). For this one moment at least, in this particular phrase, we have no trouble understanding Dante. Readers, even those most acutely aware of the ambiguity or multiplicity of senses of Dante's writing, have taken this particular sentence to mean one and only one thing - namely, that the dream's true meaning or correct interpretation is now perfectly clear or manifestly obvious even to the simplest persons (i.e., not only to the most sophisticated): Musa, for instance, renders e manifestissimo a li piu semplici as "is completely clear even to the least sophisticated [emphasis added]"26 (yet there is nothing in the Italian text that authorizes the insertion of the word "even"). It seems perfectly obvious that what Dante says in this phrase is that his dream's meaning, once extremely difficult to under- stand, now is perfectly obvious to everyone, even to the simplest - and no one, to my knowledge, has had occasion to think or say otherwise. Some may have called into question the sincerity or accuracy of the phrase, some may have attributed to it an ironic rhetorical function, but no one has disputed that its basic grammatical meaning is literal, limpid, clear, manifestissimo. The most basic or literal translation of the phrase "ora e manifestissi- mo a li piu semplici" is something like "now it [i.e., lo verace giudicio] is perfectly (or completely) clear (or obvious) to the simplest [persons]." The idea that Dante is saying that the true meaning or correct interpreta- tion now is perfectly clear even to the simplest persons - an idea which has slipped into Musa's translation - is literally absent from Dante's text. Musa's translation is already an interpretation (a subjective projection of an extra-textual assumption or presupposition). In fact, nowhere does 143</page><page sequence="12">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 Dante say literally what is implied by Musa's addition of the word "even"; nowhere does Dante say that the true meaning is perfectly clear not only to the sophisticated or most intelligent readers but even to the simplest readers. In my view, Dante's text very clearly says that the correct interpreta- tion is perfectly obvious to the simplest persons; at the same time, it clearly does not say that the correct interpretation is perfectly obvious to the most sophisticated persons. It is perfectly possible (and indeed there is no objective textual reason to think otherwise) that Dante is saying that the true meaning or correct interpretation remains unclear, elusive, ambiguous, variable or plural, to the most sophisticated readers, even while that meaning is perfectly clear to the simplest ones. But how can the simplest readers possess a more certain grasp of the true meaning than the most sophisticated? To say that a text has a singular meaning that is obvious to the simple- minded is not quite, indeed not at all, the same as to say that a text's meaning is universally, objectively, absolutely singular and obvious to everyone. Dante is not saying that the text (the dream, the sonnet) now is simple, understandable, clear, or obvious even to the simplest (persons, readers, audiences), but rather he is saying that to simple persons, the true meaning is perfectly obvious - or, now that you have said that the text's meaning is completely clear, you are simple. The phrase in question signifies, to put it slightly differently, that the belief in the text's obviousness is a sign of one's sim- plicity. If the text's meaning is "perfectly obvious to the simplest," this perfect obviousness has less to do the objective reality of the text than with the fact that the simplest are those for whom meaning is always perfectly obvious. There is a most significant medieval precedent for this idea that one's belief in the clarity or obviousness of the text is a function of one's sim- plicity, that the meaning of one and the same text may be perfectly clear to the simple folk yet still unclear to and ambiguous for the most sophis- ticated. I am referring to the great Islamic Aristotelian, Ibn Rushd (Averroes), a thinker whose influence on Dante's age (and indeed on Dante in particular) was enormous.27 In his Fasl al-maqal {Decisive Treatise on the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy), Ibn Rushd (following a tradition established by Al-Ghazali) divides humankind into three classes - the philosophers, the theologians, and the masses (the former class being those whom Dante calls the "noble," the latter class those whom Dante calls the semplici, the simple folk).28 These three classes are distinguished, 144</page><page sequence="13">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuovaj, GREGORY B. STONE respectively, by the three different types of discourse to which they give their assent - demonstrative, dialectical, rhetorical: For the natures of men are on different levels with respect to [their paths to] assent. One of them comes to assent through demonstration; another comes to assent through dialectical arguments, just as firmly as the demonstrative man through demonstration, since his nature does not contain any greater capacity; while another comes to assent through rhetorical arguments, again just as firmly as the demonstrative man through demonstrative arguments.29 What furthermore distinguishes the three classes of humankind are their different hermeneutic theories, their different attitudes concerning the interpretation of the Qur'an (Koran). The philosophers are an elite class who regard the Qur'an as a text whose manifest significance - Ibn Rushd calls this its "exterior meaning" - is different from its true latent meaning (the philosophers are those who regard lo verace giudicio as not manifestissi- mo). The philosophers are those in whose eyes the discourse of the Qur'an is figural, metaphorical, rhetorical - i.e., not literal, always saying something other than the obvious. The philosophers are those who do not give their assent to rhetoric: they do not accept that the Qur'an's metaphorical discourse is literally true (though the Qur'an speaks of God as "seeing" and "hearing," the philosophers reject the simpleton's notion that God really has eyes and ears, literally has an anthropomorphic body). If the philosophers refuse to assent to rhetoric, they do on the other hand give their assent to demonstrative discourse: they believe that the Qur'an's true meaning is that which can be proven or discovered using Aristotelian demonstrative logic - specifically, using only those syllogisms whose premises are indisputably or universally valid. For an absolute or ultimate philosopher (Ibn Rushd suggests that in reality no one is so sus- picious of the obvious or external sense as to always read philosophically), all passages in Holy Writ are difficult and obscure, all passages say some- thing other than what they seem to say, all passages demand an interpre- tation which rejects the manifest and uncovers the latent. The second class of humankind, the theologians, resemble the philosophers in that neither do they give their assent to rhetoric, and they too believe that the Qur'an requires interpretation to reveal its true latent meaning. But the theologians differ from the philosophers in that they give their assent to dialectical rather than demonstrative logic. This means that the theolo- gians do not so much demonstrate what is true as they dialectically negate 145</page><page sequence="14">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 others' claims to have demonstrated what is true. Furthermore, the the- ologians use an inferior mode of logic (dialectics) whose syllogisms are constructed from premises which are not indisputably or universally valid (i.e., from premises whose only authority is scriptural). In Ibn Rushd's view, the theologians do not care whether the Qur'an is in accord with universal or objective truth, but rather they sophistically twist or distort the text so that it seems to support their own partial, corporate or sectari- an interests (and thus the theologians are responsible for social strife, vio- lence, and war). The third class of humankind, the masses or simpletons, "those who are not people of interpretation at all,9'30 are those who do give their assent to rhetoric: they accept that those passages of the Qur'an which the philosopher considers metaphorical are instead simply and literally true. The simple masses are those who do not see that rhetorical discourse is rhetorical (those who do not see that there is always some meaning that is not man- ifest, those for whom meaning is always obvious). For the masses, the Qur'an means what it says, and its correct interpretation is perfectly obvi- ous and completely clear, manifestissimo. For an absolute or ultimate sim- pleton, no passages of Holy Writ are difficult to understand; or, as Dante's phrase (according to my interpretation) implies, the more simple-minded you are, the easier the text is to understand. For Ibn Rushd, to be a member of the masses means to make the claim that there is no ambiguity, no equivoca- tion, that a given signifier has one and only one single and obvious mean- ing (God's "seeing" can only and obviously signify that God has eyes and sees). The masses are those who deny or ignore the text's duplicity, who will always pronounce the verace giudicio to be singular, who will speak, as in Dante's phrase, of "lo verace giudicio" ("the true interpretation"). I am arguing that Dante, in the phrase "lo verace giudicio . . . ora e manifestissimo a li piu semplici" ("the true interpretation . . . now is per- fectly obvious to the simplest persons"), is formulating a version of the Averroistic hermeneutic hierarchy: lipiu semplici are those who say that the text demands no further interpretation, that its true meaning is perfectly obvious. Neither Dante nor Ibn Rushd says that the text's meaning really is singular, perfectly obvious or completely clear; Ibn Rushd does say (and, according to my reading, Dante implies) that if yon say that lo verace giudi- cio is singular, obvious and clear, then you belong to the vulgar herd, you are one of the masses, one of lipiu semplici. Now, I am not quite finished with Ibn Rushd's Fast al-maqal. For the most intriguing suggestion in that treatise is that the philosopher's interpreta- 146</page><page sequence="15">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuova), GREGORY B. STONE tion is not more true than the simpleton's. Ibn Rushd insists that the Qur'an's strategy is to use any means possible to win the reader's assent.31 In fact the demonstrative level of its significance (the meaning ascribed to it by philosophers) is not more accurate (except in the eyes of philosophers themselves, including Ibn Rushd himself) than the rhetorical level (the meaning ascribed to it by the masses). One level of meaning is not "more true" than another, but rather each level is meant to convince a certain class of reader that Holy Writ is true and thus is worthy of one's attention. The Qur'an's aim is not to teach or communicate to us "the truth" but rather to persuade us that it has done so - ultimately in order to gain our assent to its ethical precepts.32 Whatever you say concerning the Qur'an, no matter how learned or how ignorant you may be, what you say turns out to be, says Ibn Rushd, "truth."33 If both the teachings assented to by philosophical sophisticates and those assented to by the simpleton masses are qualified by Ibn Rushd as "telling the truth," this can only be because truth for Ibn Rushd is neither an objective, immutable, transcendent thing nor is it in the text. The Qur'an does not have or possess a truth, nor is its aim to impart or communicate to the reader some such singular truth (nor some single set of objective truths). On the contrary, the Qur'an's aim is rhetorical and ethical; its goal is to be valued to such an extent that it persuades its readers to follow its ethical precepts.34 Whatever "truth" the reader gleans from the Qur'an, then, is part of a strategy by which the text convinces the reader of its value. If the Qur'an seems to teach a mul- tiplicity of "truths," this is in truth a reflection of the multiplicity of diverse communities or classes of readers, each of which requires a dif- ferent illusory "truth-effect" to be convinced of the Qur'an's value.35 On this account, truth is not an objective or transcendent entity which is somehow contained in the text and which could be shown or explained to different classes, communities, or groups in different times or in different places (it is not, let us say, "portable" or "transferable" from one commu- nity to the next), but rather truth is particular to each class, community or group, is situated in the community and projected upon the text. Furthermore and most importantly, the only foundation or criterion for the legitimacy of a truth is the community's agreement or consensus that what it calls the truth is the truth. Since there is no objective truth against which to measure different interpretations of Scripture, all that establish- es the validity of a "true meaning" or a "correct interpretation" is the com- munity's act or practice of agreeing that they know the true meaning or 147</page><page sequence="16">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 correct interpretation.36 Here let me mention in passing that, up to this point, I have been using two translations of the word giudicio - "meaning" and "interpretation" - as if they are equivalent and interchangeable. In fact, "interpretation" is clearly preferable, for the Italian giudicio is a "judgment," an "opinion" - a subjective act, like an interpretation, that always takes place in a certain historical situation. "Meaning," on the contrary, connotes something that may be thought to exist per se, in a transcendent or objective fashion. Dante, here at the end of the Vita Nuova's third chapter, does not speak of the "meaning" of his text (as if the meaning were some permanent thing), but rather he speaks of someone's "judgment" or "opinion" concerning his text, thereby throwing the emphasis on the subjectivity of interpreta- tion, not on the objectivity of meaning. Thus, Dante is not so much say- ing that there is a true meaning of his text as he is saying that the simpleton will see his own simpleton's interpretation ("judgment," "opin- ion") as being obviously true and the only possible one. It is completely obvious to simple persons that their subjective opinions are the objective truth: in Dante's words, "the true meaning is completely obvious to the simplest persons." If I here hesitate to translate verace giudicio as "true inter- pretation," this is not only because "true interpretation" is something of an oxymoron, but also because, to the simplest persons, there are no such things as "interpretations," there are only "meanings" (so perhaps "mean- ing" is, after all, the preferable translation of giudicio, since Dante's point, according to my account, is that the simple do not see their judgments as judgments, do not recognize the role of subjectivity or interpretation in the construction of "true meaning"). Let us look yet again at the end of the Vita Nuova's third chapter: A questo sonetto fue risposto da mold e di diverse sentenzie Lo verace giudi- cio del detto sogno non fue veduto allora per alcuno, ma ora e manifestissimo a li piu semplici. What I have proposed is reading this passage in such a way that the "true meaning" or "correct interpretation" (lo verace giudicio) is seen not as pre- existing (and thus not as eternal or changeless, not as transcending a spe- cific context or situation) but rather as produced by the simpleton reader's discovery or proclamation of its existence. Then, in the past, there was no single true meaning but only various meanings (diverse sentenzie); now, 148</page><page sequence="17">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuovaj, GREGORY B. stone only after the advent of the simpleton reader, there is a true meaning which is perfectly clear. There is, in other words, a temporal or historical dimension to the "correct interpretation." If we grant ourselves the liber- ty to elide, we can read the final phrase as follows: "Lo verace giudicio del detto sogno non fue . . . allora, . . . ma ora e" ["Then, the true meaning of the dream was not (i.e., did not exist), but now it is (i.e., does exist")].37 If meaning once was not but now is, if it can pass in and out of existence, then clearly it lacks the sort of eternal, timeless, universal, or transcendent sta- tus implicit in the (Singletonian and formalist) idea that there is, was, and always will be a single true and obvious meaning of the Vita Nuova. The single true and obvious meaning of Dante's dream does not exist until and unless the simpleton (he or she who belongs to a community that believes that one can speak of single true and obvious meanings) says that it does. For the community of simpletons there is indeed such a thing as lo verace giudicio which is manifestissimo. If, however, there were no community of simpleton readers, if every reader of the Vita Nuova were hermeneutically and philosophically sophisticated, then there would be no such thing as a perfectly obvious true meaning of Dante's dream. True or objective mean- ing does not exist except insofar as it is posited or proclaimed to exist by a community of readers. And thus my reading of the phrase "ora e mani- festissimo a li piu semplici," seen in the light of this hermeneutic, requires no proof: from now on, this phrase means what I have said it means, not because such a meaning has always been objectively "there" in Dante's text but simply because it has pleased me to say so. Many will undoubtedly complain that Dante could never possibly have conceived of such a radically subjective notion of interpretation. Dante is, after all, commonly considered to have regarded the task of writing as the mimetic representation of objective, immutable, transcendent truth. Yet, even if we were to grant that Dante generally in his corpus regards texts as having objectively true meanings, there is no law which prohibits him from espousing a radically different position here in the Vita Nuova. Anyone who denies that Dante could have embraced a hermeneutic the- ory which is "Averroistic" in the sense that I have here explained must for- get, ignore, or repress the Vita Nuova's most explicit hermeneutic manifesto, a remarkable moment that we must no longer pretend does not exist.38 Chapter xxdc, Dante's exegesis, his interpretation of the number nine's affinity for Beatrice, is the major hermeneutic moment of the entire Vita 149</page><page sequence="18">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 Nuova, the closest we can come to witnessing the libello's "theory of inter- pretation." Here I must cite a large portion of the chapter, though it is pri- marily the astonishing final sentence which draws our attention: Perche questo numero fosse in tanto amico di lei, questa potrebbe essere una ragione: con cid sia cosa che, secondo Tolomeo e secondo la cristiana veritade, nove siano li cieli che si muovono, e secondo comune oppinione astrologa, li detti cieli adoperino qua giuso secondo la loro abitudine insieme, questo numero fue amico di lei per dare ad intendere che ne la sua generazione tutti e nove li mobili cieli perfettissimamente s'aveano insieme. Questa e una ragione di cid; ma piu sottil- mente pensando, e secondo la infallibile veritade, questo numero fue ella medes- ima; per similitudine dico, e cio intendo cosi. Lo numero del tre e la radice del nove, pero che, sanza numero altro alcuno, per se medesimo fa nove, si come vedemo manifestamente che tre via tre fa nove. Dunque se lo tre e fattore per se medesimo del nove, e lo fattore per se medesimo de li miracoli e tre, cioe Padre e Figlio e Spirito Santo, li quali sono tre e uno, questa donna fue accompagnata da questo numero del nove a dare ad intendere ch'ella era uno nove, cioe uno mira- colo, la cui radice, cioe del miracolo, e solamente la mirabile Trinitade. Forse anco- ra per piu sottile persona si vederebbe in cio piu sottile ragione; ma questa e quella ch'io ne veggio, e che piu mi piace. It pleases me to read this last sentence ("Perhaps a more subtle mind could find a still more subtle reason for it; but this is the one which I perceive and which pleases me the most") as the negation of the objectivity of everything that precedes it. Here Dante gives the lie to or deflates the pre- tense to truth of his entire grand exegetical performance. He clearly and shamelessly exposes the essentially subjective foundation of what he pro- poses to be the "true meaning" of the phenomenon in question. Nowhere in this passage does Dante speak of his interpretation as being true or cor- rect {infallibile veritade or "infallible truth" is not a claim that his interpreta- tion is infallibly true, since what Dante is claiming to be true is only the premise, not the conclusion, of his argument). Dante does not speak of his interpretation as being manifestly and objectively true, but rather he speaks of it as appealing to him, as pleasing him, as that to which he gives his assent, as that which makes him happy. Dante violates the law of objectiv- ity by allowing his own desire to play a role in the constitution of meaning. Moreover, the final phrase explicitly asserts that Dante's proclamation of true meaning is personal and subjective rather than universal and objective: "questa e quella ch'to ne veggio" ("this is what / see in it"). If Dante near the outset of this passage uses the conditional form of the verb 150</page><page sequence="19">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuovaj, GREGORY B. STONE to express the possible fallibility of his interpretation ["questa potrebbe essere una ragione" ("this could be one explanation")], by the end of the passage he obviously asserts the possibility of other contradictory inter- pretations. And not only does he suggest that others will contradict him, but he goes so far as to enact such contradiction by contradicting himself. Dante proposes not one but rather two ragioni, two "reasons," two subjec- tive explanations or interpretations of one and the same objective thing (just as Ibn Rushd maintains that there are always at least two subjective readings - one "demonstrative" [the philosopher's] and one "rhetorical" [the simpleton's] - of one and the same objective element of the Qur'an). For Dante, who is not a simpleton, there is no such thing as lo veracegiu- dicio ("the true meaning") but only diverse sentenzie ("various meanings"). The famous theory of the "double truth" of the Averroists or radical Aristotelians of Dante's age was rooted in Ibn Rushd's distinction between falsafa (philosophy) and shari'a (revealed law, scripture). For Christian philosophers of the late thirteenth century, this means a distinc- tion between the truths proposed by Greek natural philosophy, cosmolo- gy, and metaphysics and the truths proposed by the Bible. For the Averroists, both the philosophers and the theologians expressed "true," albeit contradictory, reasonable explanations of one and the same uni- verse. Clearly two contradictory explanations cannot both be "true" in any objective sense; rather, they are only "true" in the sense that it pleases the members of a certain community to believe in their truth: if the philoso- phers agree that Aristotle's philosophy is true, then it is true, and if the theologians agree that the Bible is true, then it is true.39 Dante's double interpretation of one and the same fact - the number nine's affinity for Beatrice - is, I propose, a dramatic enactment of the Averroistic double truth: Dante illustrates the distinction between philosopher and theologian by playing both roles in one and the same very brief chapter. (Indeed Dante alludes to the Averroistic foundation of this chapter when in its very first phrase he invokes the Arabic intellectual tra- dition: "Io dico che, secondo l'usanza d'Arabia . . . .") As I have already mentioned, Ibn Rushd distinguishes between philosophers and theolo- gians on the basis of the types of syllogisms to which they give their assent. To practice philosophy is to base one's conclusions on premises that are indisputably true or axiomatic. The philosopher's demonstrative syllogism commences with a statement that is universally recognized to be true, that is in accord with the common or universal opinion of all rea- 151</page><page sequence="20">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 sonable thinking persons, or that has already been proven true by Greek natural philosophy or Aristotelian metaphysics - a statement such as "the First Cause is a Unity," which all persons (Christian, Muslim, or Jew) would grant to be true. To practice theology is to base one's conclusions on premises that are not universally granted or axiomatic. The theolo- gian's dialectical syllogism commences with a statement whose only foun- dation is that it belongs to the discourse of revealed law or Scripture - a statement such as "God is Three Persons in One," which only Christians would grant to be true. Now, Dante's two interpretations, here in Chapter xxdc, of the mean- ing of the number nine's affinity for Beatrice are subtly differentiated: the first employs demonstrative logic (the language of philosophy) and the second employs dialectical logic (the language of theology). The premises of the first interpretation are the following: secondo Tolomeo e secondo la cristiana veritade, nove siano li cieli che si muovono, e secondo comune oppinione astrologa, li detti cieli adoperino qua giuso secondo la loro abitudine insieme. . . . This first argument is demonstrative or philosophical: its premises are authorized by Greek Science (Ptolemy) and by universal common wis- dom (comune oppinione). This comune oppinione is, I might add, Dante's ren- dition of communes conceptiones animi ("common notions of the mind"), which is a phrase used by John of Salisbury (in Metalogicon, iv, 8) to define the axiomatic premises of demonstrative logic. Here Dante's reference to "Christian truth" is, logically speaking, irrelevant or unnecessary: it is not a prerequisite for nor does it alter in any way the conclusion of his argu- ment, which would have been just the same had no mention been made of any Christian premise (if Dante here mentions "Christian truth," it is only to suggest, in the manner of Aquinas, that there may well be an accord between Greek philosophy and revealed Scripture). According to Ibn Rushd's account of philosophical logic, whatever truth, interpreta- tion, or conclusion concerning Beatrice which Dante draws from an argu- ment which could be based solely on scientific and universal premises is a philosophical one. The premises of Dante's second argument concerning Beatrice are grounded in what Dante calls "infallible truth" (infallibile veritade). This truth itself reveals a double aspect, for it is both the infallible fact that 152</page><page sequence="21">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuovaj, Gregory b. stone three is the square root of nine (an indisputable, universal mathematical truth and thus the premise of a demonstrative or philosophical syllogism) as well as the infallible fact (but now only infallible in the opinion of Christians) that the Creator or Fattore ("Maker"; there is also a pun here alluding to the mathematical sense of the word "factor") is Three and One (a disputable revealed truth and thus the premise of a dialectical or theo- logical syllogism). Since Dante's second interpretation of the number nine's affinity for Beatrice rests in part on a theological premise (on the Christian's claim that God is a Trinity), then the truth of that interpreta- tion cannot be a philosophical but can only be a theological one. I am arguing that the presence in this chapter of two ragioni or inter- pretations of one and the same fact is no accident, no mere whim on Dante's part, but rather is a clear if subtle allusion to the "double truth" of the radical Aristotelians. Dante's hermeneutic manifesto, Chapter xxdc of the Vita Nuova, is an Averroistic insistence on the irreducible plurality of "true meaning" or "correct interpretation" (verace giudicio): for Dante, a single interpretation does not suffice. Unlike the simpleton of the Vita Nuova's third chapter who believes in an obvious singular true meaning, Dante here divides himself into two (plays the role, first, of philosopher, then, of theologian) and thereby espouses the duplicity of interpretive truth. Dante, admitting that he has not said the truth in any universal, transcendent, immutable or objective sense, represents interpretation not as a matter of revealing such a singular truth but rather both as a matter of perspective as well as a matter of desire (being pleased and made happy by one's own interpretation). Finally, the final phrase of Chapter xxdc insists above all on the narcis- sistic structure of interpretation, on the fact that the meaning that Dante constructs is a reflection of his own interests and capacities. Let us look at this phrase once more: Forse ancora per /rid sottile persona si vederebbe in do piu sottile ragione; ma ques- ta e quella ch'io ne veggio, e che piu mi piace. What is most striking and of utmost importance in this sentence is the exact mirror-like repetition of the phrase piu sottile, as this exact same adjectival phrase describes both the subject and the object of interpretation: if you are a person qualified as being x, then what you see when you study or interpret an object is itself qualified as being x. Since in Dante's stilno- 153</page><page sequence="22">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 vist circle to be sottile signifies to be a "philosopher," to have studied phi- losophy at the University of Bologna, then we may paraphrase as follows: the more of a philosopher you are the more philosophical your interpre- tation will be. Is this not precisely the gist of Ibn Rushd's hermeneutics, according to which the philosopher will see the Qur'an as hiding the truths of philosophy, the theologian will see it as hiding the theological dogmas of his own sect, the simpleton will see it as hiding nothing, as simply saying what it says? Most significant of all is the way Dante does not phrase the first part of this sentence: he does not say that if you are more subtle or more philosophical then your reading will be better, more true, more accurate, more correct.40 He does seem to say, on the other hand, that, no matter how simple or subtle you are, what you see when you interpret will be what pleases you most - namely, a mirror-image of your- self (a subtle person will see a subtle text, a simple person a simple one). The more time you have spent at Bologna studying philosophical trea- tises, then the more your interpretations will resemble the sorts of philo- sophical treatises studied at Bologna. But your interpretations will not thereby be more objectively accurate than mine, they will merely be more philosophical. Here Dante implies that the goal of interpreting is the interpreter's pleasure or happiness; the interpreter's task, that is, is not to reveal or expose to the world certain objective, transcendent truths. Dante is not sad to think that others may interpret more correctly than he, because he does not conceive of interpretation as a contest to come near- est the Truth (nor as a matter of forcing others to be pleased by what pleases you). What matters for the interpreter is that he or she be pleased and made happy by his or her interpretation, that he or she assent to the interpretation by which he or she is most seduced. Dante, in being pleased with and made happy by his own interpretations while at the same time denying that they constitute objective knowledge of Truth (and while also insisting that it would be quite possible for someone to offer "more philo- sophical" interpretations than he has), is allowing for both the philoso- pher's and the simpleton's happiness. Dante freely admits that he is not the world's greatest philosopher (i.e., that his own interpretation is not "correct" or "true"), but this admission does not at all detract from the pleasure that he derives from his interpretation. No matter where one stands on the spectrum of philosophical or hermeneutic sophistication, one is equally likely as anyone else to be made happy by one's own inter- pretation. Philosophical superiority, that is, is not a prerequisite for 154</page><page sequence="23">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuova,), GREGORY B. STONE hermeneutic felicity. Some (the philosophers) are pleased by their claim that there are diverse sentenzie, others (the simpletons) are pleased to say that there is a single obvious veracegiudicio.

Noakes cannot, of course, accept this phrase as literally true, since she argues that the dream's true meaning is that its meaning is other than manifest: "Is it 'manifestissimo,' even 'ora,' today? Study of the critical record suggests not. ... I think Dante is exaggerating in this sentence for a purpose, to convey something to an elite readership . . ." [p. 49]. Unfortunately, Noakes fails to specify what this "something" is which Dante's "exaggeration" means to convey. My point here is that the phrase still stands as an embarassment to any critic who maintains that the dream's meaning is not obvious to the sim- plest reader. Noakes eventually comments on the phrase in two ways: first, the fact that under- standing the dream takes a good deal of time (the difference between then and now) implies that Dante's text has a "rich texture" and "requires such an expenditure of time and rewards those who meet this requirement" - implies, that is, that his text is full of not immediately obvious latent significance [p. 52] ; secondly, the phrase is Dante's self-congratulatory claim that he alone, with the prose commentary of the Vita Nuova (now that Dante's prose has unveiled the sense of his poetry), has made his once obscure sonnet become manifestissmo: Dante alone is the master exegete [p. 52]. 156</page><page sequence="25">Dante's Averroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuova), GREGORY B. stone 19.

De Libera (Ibid., passim) clearly establishes that for Dante (at least for the Dante of the Convivio, a text that was apparently looming on the horizon when Dante composed the Vita Nuova) to be a "noble" person is synonymous with being a "philosopher," and he shows the extent to which Dante's notion of nobility is inherited from the medieval Islamic tradition's notion of philosophy. Though Dante's division of humanity into the noble and the simple is not a tripartite one, in practice neither was Ibn Rushd's, since the great majority of his attention is given to the difference between the noble philosophers (those for whom meaning is not obvious) and the simple masses (those for whom meaning is obvious). 29.

Thus Ibn Rushd says that "Scripture has to contain every method of [bringing about] judgements of assent and every method of forming concepts" (Hourani, p. 64): what matters, again, is that the reader judge or value the Law as being worthy of his or her assent, not whether or not the reader understands the "true meaning" of the Law. 32. Whether or not this radical denial that Holy Writ is objectively or transcendentally true really reflects Ibn Rushd's own view, such a denial was certainly "thinkable" in the late Middle Ages. What is pertinent to my reading of Dante is not what Ibn Rushd actually thought but rather what sorts of "Averroist" thoughts were current in Dante's age. One such thought is summed up in the following phrase, attributed to Ibn Rushd by Gilles of Rome: Nulla Lex est vera, licet possit utilis ("No Law is true, although it may be useful"; cited in De Libera, p. 167). By "Law" here is meant "Scripture," so that the phrase signifies that, although neither the Qur'an nor the Bible are accurate or true accounts of objective reality, they are pragmatically valuable insofar as they serve the ethical interests of communities (e.g., the fear of the Last Judgment keeps the crime rate lower than it would otherwise be). Scripture is not a neutral statement of facts, not a transparent representation of the Real, but is a rhetoric, an attempt to urge certain types of actions. The great champion of this radical understanding of Ibn Rushd was the Italian Pietro Pomponazzi (1464- 1525), who argues, as Oliver Leaman says (Averroes and his Philosophy [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988], p. 171), that Ibn Rushd "proved that religious laws [above all the doctrine of personal 157</page><page sequence="26">Dante Studies, CXII, 1994 immortality] are neither true nor false, but solely designed to lead people to a life of virtue." 33. "We the Muslim community know definitely that demonstrative study [i.e., the philoso- pher's understanding of the Qur'an] does not lead to [conclusions] conflicting with what Scripture has given us; for truth [i.e., the philosopher's understanding] does not oppose truth [i.e., the simpleton's understanding] but accords with it and bears witness to it." (Hourani, p. 50) 34. Insofar as medieval Islamic philosophers acknowledge that the Qur'an is a poetic text, they are acknowledging that its language is not entirely bound by the duty simply to represent the objective truth about certain objective realities. The best analysis of the rhetorical function of poetic language, its license to deviate from the truth-telling, mimetic, or documentary function of ordinary constative utterances, is Ibn Sina's (Avicenna's): it is, says Ibn Sina, perfectly legiti- mate for a poet, moved to describe a rose, to say, "The rose is a mule's anus with turds in its midst"; this is in no way true, but telling the truth is not necessarily the poet's aim, since he or she may primarily aim, as in this case, to disgust his audience [see L. E. Goodman, Avicenna (London and New York: Routledge, 1992), p. 222]. The Qur'an is poetic in this sense: it does not necessarily aim to tell the truth about God or the cosmos, since it may primarily aim, not of course to disgust but rather to seduce, to attract the reader, to place the reader under its spell in order to gain his or her assent. 35. Thus the Qur'an does not primarily teach or communicate new and never before imag- ined metaphysical truths; rather it reassures a particular audience that what it has always believed to be true is true. This is implied by Ibn Rushd's citation of a certain saying: "Speak to people about what they know." (Hourani, p. 52) 36. For a contemporary version of this Averroistic hermeneutic, see Stanley Fish, Doing What Comes Naturally: Change, Rhetoric, and the Practice of Theory in Literary and Legal Studies (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1989), in which Fish uses the term "formalism" to des- ignate a belief that meaning is "embedded in texts" and not, as Fish believes, "a matter of what a speaker situated in a particular situation has in mind" (p. 7). I am arguing that Dante's Averroist hermeneutics denies all of the following beliefs, which are among those attributed by Fish (p. 6) to "formalism": 1) "that words have clear meanings"; 2) "that minds see those meanings clearly"; 3) "that clarity is a condition that persists through changes in context"; 4) "that nothing in the self interferes with the perception of clarity"; 5) "that meanings are a property of language"; 6) "that interpretive desires must (and can) be set aside." 37. According to twelfth-century speculative grammarians, the verb "to be" has two func- tions: it functions as other verbs when it simply proclaims that something is (i.e., that something exists); it may also function as a copula or predicate (to proclaim, for instance, that Socrates is white, where the force of the verb is not to proclaim Socrate's existence but to predicate a specific qual- ity). See Karin Margereta Fredborg, "Speculative Grammar," in A History of Twelfth-Century Western Philosophy, ed. Peter Dronke (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 188. I am suggesting that Dante's "essere" in this passage be read simply as a verb, not as a copula or predicate. 38. One of the few critics who does not conceal or ignore his knowledge of this moment is John Kleiner, who says (p. 94) in his "Finding the Center: Revelation and Reticence in the Vita Nuova" [Texas Studies in Literature and Language, xxxii, 1 (Spring, 1990), 85-100]: "Dante does not claim that his reading of the Beatrician nine is true, but only that his reading pleases him more than any other. At the moment when Dante is most explicit about the meaning of events, he is also the most tentative about his authority. The central event of the Vita Nuova cannot, it appears, be definitively glossed even by Dante." 39. Recent scholars have tended to deny that any of the so-called radical Aristotelians of Dante's age actually subscribed to the idea of a "double truth." Alain de Libera, for instance, argues that the "double truth" was a myth invented by the theologians in order to incriminate the philosophers (Penserau moyen age, pp. 122ff). Rather than saying that there was indeed a doctrine of "double truth," it is perhaps more accurate to say that the Averroists regarded philosophy and theology as two different perspectives on one and the same Truth, neither of which could claim to be "the whole truth" or to be "more true" than the other. Ibn Rushd himself seems to main- 158</page><page sequence="27">Dante's Auerroistic Hermeneutics (On 'Meaning' in the Vita Nuova,), GREGORY B. STONE tain not that there are two or more truths but that there is (as de Libera says concerning Boethius of Dacia's position on this matter) "une relativite des points de vue sur une verite unique" (Penser au moyen age, p. 124). That is, for Ibn Rushd there is indeed only one single and absolute Truth; what is multiple, relativistic, and never absolutely true are the various accounts or interpretations of that Truth proffered by various communities. 40. Singleton (p. 42) sees Dante's statement as essentially identical to one by Augustine: "And this I say without prejudice to any other interpretation that may be as good or better" In my view, Dante and Augustine are not at all making the same claim. Dante clearly rewrites Augustine's phrase to make it say, "And this I say without prejudice to any other interpretation that may be more subtle" thus omitting any reference to "good" or "better" (i.e., more accurate or adequate) interpretations. For Dante (as for Ibn Rushd), unlike Augustine, there is no possibili- ty that a reader's interpretation will be "good" or "better" in relation to another reader's: each will produce, according to his capacities, a different reading, a reading which will be nothing other than a reflection of the reader's subjectivity, not a neutral grasp of an objective fact, not something measurable by a transcendent or objective standard of excellence or adequacy. 159</page></plain_text>
