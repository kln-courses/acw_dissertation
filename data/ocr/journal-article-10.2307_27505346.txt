<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 15, No. 3, 1976 The Dichotomy of Man: Religion vs. Science NATHAN ROTH The dialogue and often the dispute between religion and science can be said to have started, in its modern form, in the controversy between Thomas Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce concerning Darwin's theory of evolution.1 Prior to that point, and ever since the Renaissance, the scientist was likely to whisper those of his views that might be considered heretical,2 and the power of the church carried the day in differences of opinion. Since that time, there have been scientists who have lived comfortably with their religious views and whose expositions of these principles have probably met with ready acceptance by theologians; William James and his The Varieties of Religious Experience is a good example.3 There have been scientists who have expounded their religious views in such a way as not to obtain the support of other scientists; thus while Albert Einstein says that "only individuals of exceptional endowments" rise above the anthropomorphic conception of God, in his own exposition of "cosmic religious feeling" he uses anthropomorphic analogies and speaks of the superior intelligence revealed in the "harmony of natural law."4 On the other hand, his opinion that the man of science cannot accept the concept of a personal God is not likely to be greeted with enthusiasm by theologians. Other scientists, such as James B. Conant, say that religion and science cannot have a dialogue, since they are on different levels of discourse; they "constitute incompatible universes of inquiry"; this leaves little room for rapprochement and mutual understanding.5 There are scientists who, in their efforts at reconciliation of the two bodies of thought, merely reiterate their religious teachings and beliefs, and so bring no new viewpoint for consensual enlightenment.6 When the religious man says: "It is never a matter of objective propositions amenable to verification. By its very nature, religion demands our participation rather than proof or verification," he speaks ana thema to the scientist; what cannot be objectively verified to an independent observer is poppycock to the scientist.7 When the illustrious John Dewey says: "any activity pursued in behalf of an ideal and against obstacles and in spite of threats of personal loss because of conviction of its general and enduring value is religious in quality," his word carries no cogency for the scientist who, by this definition, is being religious every day of his life while perhaps maintaining that Nathan Roth, M.D., is Associate Professor of Clinical Psychiatry in the New York University School of Medicine, New York City, and Director of Psychiatry in the New York Infirmary.</page><page sequence="2">152 Journal of Religion and Health he is irreligious and atheistic.8 Indeed, this was Pastor Pfister's evaluation of Sigmund Freud, who looked on all religion as a mass neurotic phenomenon.9 Non liquet. To the scientists who hold no brief for religion, the ancient antagonism of the church to science is difficult to overlook. The church has no grounds for satisfaction with this part of its history. To bring a man like Galileo Galilei before the Inquisition, to order him to go into seclusion and to abjure his astronomical conclusions, is to train him in apostasy that he might have been expected to employ against his religious faith. Some of these antiscientific pronouncements have a comical element. The phrenological teachings of Franz Joseph Gall were interdicted as dangerous to religion, while contemporaneously the Christian theologian Johann Caspar Lavater was not prevented from founding his science of physiognomy, by which he detected traits of character and intellect from a study of facial features. Phrenology was to sound its own death knell without the church's being needlessly exercised. When modern irreligious scientists speak out, they base some of their justification in past antiscientific attitudes of the church. It would seem that if common truth is to be found in religion and science to the satisfaction of all concerned, religion is going to have to do most of the demonstrating of this truth. A minority of scientists, for whatever the reasons, take part in the effort. They often feel that they can get along without religion. When asked if they do not fear facing their Maker and the hereafter, they are apt to reply, if they do at all, in the manner of Heinrich Heine, who, when asked in his terminal illness if he had made his peace with God, replied, "God will forgive me; that is His business." This must be a matter of great concern for the church and the synagogue, or they are failing in their responsibility. The great scientist often reveals a sincere humility; the pettiness of his efforts in the face of what must be done is clearly immanent in his consciousness. A similar attitude on the part of religious institutions has become more prominent in recent times and commands great respect; if the commonly referred to Judaeo-Christian tradition adjures us to love our neighbors as ourselves and to walk humbly with our God, it must be recalled that much harm has been done to humanity by professed religionists in their zeal to stamp out nonbelievers. The present warfare between Moslems and Christians in Lebanon may be cited as an example, even though it probably has a predominantly political motivation. The failure of religious people to live up to their own precepts, difficult though this may be, gives ammunition for irreligious attitudes in science. The fact that the scientist does not always display a paradigm of virtue is no refutation of the argument. He, too, can be good at casuistry. Moreover, the scientist who is irreligious speaks out more boldly today than he did a few years ago, and so is a redoubtable opponent. There is hope, however. It may be borne in mind that fine work is being done to day in the scientific study of religious phenomena.10 How this antagonism, a sometimes seemingly irreconcilable opposition, arose is an old story and needs to be mentioned here only briefly. Primitive man, at the mercy of dangerous natural phenomena, wild animals, hunger, and other threats,</page><page sequence="3">The Dichotomy of Man: Religion vs. Science 153 tried to devise means for his safety. It was natural, for several reasons, that he should conceive of these threatening events and objects as emanating from beings harboring forces similar to those within himself, and so he erected his pagan gods, whom he sought to influence by supplication, sacrifice, and various other rituals. Gradually this procedure evolved from a religion of fear to one of morality, as man found that it was essential to lay down the rules by which he could survive in the human communities vital to his existence. His crowning achievement in this endeavor was his belief in his anthropomorphic God, although his revelation reversed the process, and man believed himself to be created in God's image. The mode of thinking was deductive; with little detailed knowledge of his environ ment, man's cosmology arose out of his mental processes; he beheld the world and he explained it by the powers of his mind. The scientist, in his slower appearance and development, sought the truth in a different manner. He observed, he collected data, he taxonomized, he sought correlations, he experi mented and found laws of cause and effect, and then he predicted and became an inventor. He gained enormous power over his environment, and not only achieved great protection from many of the dangers assailing him, but devised utilitarian procedures that have so enhanced the efficacy, comfort, and pleasure of his life experience that he came to command great respect. He relied heavily on the inductive method of logic. The scientist threatened to supplant the religionist whose most vigorous response to the menace was the Inquisition. But what have been described as possibly man's two greatest discoveries, the ultimate blows to his conceit, viz., that all men must die and that the world existed before man's appearance upon it,11 leave opportunity for what may be a still greater discovery?the demonstration of the same precious truth in science and religion. Then we may "hope that the present bilingualism of religion and behavioral science?good so far as it goes?may eventually lose its duality and emerge as a universal language suited to a final theory and implementation of both individual health and planetary peace."12 This is the sought-for entelechy. Religion and science do share one common feature that is beyond argument. Each has its own faith, although they are centered in different principles. Religion places its faith in there being a Lord of the universe. Science lets its faith repose in a dictum of the classical Greeks to the effect that all features of the universe can ultimately be explained by the methods of science.13, l4 And if there are clerics who sometimes lose their faith in God, a fact to which the psychiatrist can attest, there are also scientists whose faith in their credo wavers and who doubt that all data of the universe will be finally reduced to a physicochemical basis. If both show a propensity to harbor a faith, that fact alone may be ground for collaborative participation in joint endeavors. Of all the scientists about whom the cleric must be most concerned, the irreligious physician occupies first rank. Since all great religions, both Western and Oriental, are devoted to morals, ethics, values, and ideals, the person other than the cleric who touches people most intimately in these areas, the physician, commands his close scrutiny. The proliferation of discoveries by the psychiatrist and other behavioral scientists is of great relevance to the work of the theologian.</page><page sequence="4">154 Journal of Religion and Health Accordingly, seminarians are now given close acquaintance with the work of psychiatrists, whereas other branches of medicine and science have never been accorded such attention. Whether or not the physician treads the paths of religion determines, in some measure, whether or not he is a threat. The number of psychiatrists who have no appreciation or a negative evaluation of religion may come as a surprise; it is probably in the area of 80 per cent. A pastor has stated, "The wise spiritual counselor, while gladly utilizing all the constructive techniques and insights of psychiatry, will be careful never to recommend a parishioner to a consulting psychiatrist, psychologist, or psychoanalyst who is inimical to religion and unaware of the impressive resources it makes available for the building of reliant, healthy-minded personalities."15 The field for referral is narrower than may be thought. The disinterest in religion of so large a number of psychiatrists may seem like a strange phenomenon at first sight. After all, everything human is grist for the mill of the psychiatrist. Is it, therefore, because religion deals with the divine that he turns away? One might expect him to be impressed with the tremendously significant insights contained in both the Old and New Testaments and wonder how they were arrived at so early in human history. On the contrary, he acts as did Sigmund Freud, who realized that creative writers often achieve insights that the psychiatrist must labor diligently to get by his own methods, but he prefers the latter route as more trustworthy. The psychiatrist does not simply act as though he has enough to do in his own work; he often fears religious principles will lead him astray. The fact that clergymen do not have better mental health than comparable groups of people in other fields of endeavor is a significant fact for him. And even though he knows that there are some psychotic psychia trists, he does believe that the psychiatrist's work, especially psychoanalytic work, has much protective value for him in preventing emotional breakdown. Moreover, he is often unfavorably impressed by the statements of his religious colleagues. When the psychoanalyst Gregory Zilboorg said that "religious beliefs need no scientific proof, nor are they made less valid by scientific refutations," and that "psychology as a scientific discipline can shed no light whatsoever on the relations between man and God," he did nothing to bridge the gap.16 Briefly, the physician and the psychiatrist feel that they can do without God, and that they can do a better job than the clergyman can in teaching ethics. The schism between religion and medicine in general, and psychiatry in particular, is a challenge to the minister, the priest, and the rabbi. Left to his own devices, the physician will go his own way. The clergyman must find a way to intervene. He cannot rest content with the fact that clerics are attached to hospitals. His contact with attending physicians is usually minimal. He must find a direct approach to the physician himself. It is the purpose of this essay to suggest some remedial devices to bring the clergy and the medical profession together, to share more co-operative endeavors, and to bring to the physician himself the values of religion, so that he can enrich his own life and propagate these principles to his patients. In so doing the writer runs a risk. Whenever the interface between two disciplines is studied, the one</page><page sequence="5">The Dichotomy of Man: Religion, vs. Science 155 group feels that the other is amateurish when it ventures outside its own domain. If it has not already been made clear that the writer is no theologian, that fact is about to be made unmistakably apparent. This, however, must be no deterrent and the cleric should be willing to read on. After all, the clergy would not want to retreat to the position in England of some centuries ago when the laity was not even permitted to read the Bible, but had to have it read and explained by the priest. It is well known to those in the ministry and medicine that people are most likely to turn to religion when they are troubled. Especially when help cannot be found in other spheres or is not available, people try to find comfort in religion. Irreligious individuals often envy the solace that others get through the faith that is alien to them. When this happens to the scientist and physician, the cleric should seize his opportunity. The minister is not usually as available to people in trouble as is the physician. Moreover, a layman is likely to have only one accessible clergyman, whereas he can change physicians readily enough. So the troubled physician's appearance at the study of the clergyman is as much a crisis for the latter as for the former, and the clergyman must employ all the resources and skills at his disposal. Helping this one particular parishioner is a matter extending far beyond the life province of one individual. It is also advisable that religious institutions diminish the emphasis on the mystical and illusional. These are hardest for the physician to accept and least susceptible of objective scrutiny. The word of the person experiencing a religious illusion is the only evidence there is. The religious mystical experience is usually lived through by people suffering deep emotional turmoil, and in the view of the psychiatrist, that is a sign generally to be interpreted as psychopathologic. While it may be a helpful event for the individual enduring it, the day is passed when such catathymic crises carry much persuasive power for others, especially the scientist. Man is lonely and burdened and needs the support of his group. He usually carries his oppression with cheerful energy and so is much to be admired, but any accretion to this strength is a welcome and felicitous assistance. Psychiatry has recently endeavored to supply such support in group therapy, but it has borrowed this technique from religion and education and is generally not as proficient and effective in its application as might be hoped, although family therapy does hold much promise. Religion, however, offers group worship and ritual observances, participation in which is strengthening to people. To engage the skeptical scientist in them requires the relinquishing of efforts to elucidate the mysteries of life by means of faith alone, unless it be the faith that they may ultimately be explained on logical grounds. To the dispirited scientist such encouraging faith in the powers of man's continuing efforts to help himself can have a healing property. Rituals should be repeatedly interpreted and, if necessary, given new and current meaning. The original significance of many rituals is lost in antiquity, and when the interpretation is not available, participation in a ritual is a mechanistic and unappealing procedure to the man of science. What can win over the scientist to group worship is emphasis upon constructive living. Rarely</page><page sequence="6">156 Journal of Religion and Health does a group of people act as decently as it does in a house of worship, and this decency is infectious, even to the skeptic. One of the ways in which psychiatry has been strangely neglectful is in its failure to capitalize on the value of the exhortatory and inspirational. It has a rather passive attitude in this regard, allowing the individual to employ his talents in his own unique way after the psychiatrist has assisted in evoking them. The psychiatrist is fearful of moulding the patient in his own image; this attitude does have a liberating effect. But that is no reason to forego the exhilarating and activating uses of exhortation and inspiration. Sir William Osier's essays on "The Magic Word," by which he meant work, and on "Aequanimitas" are good instances of such inciting efforts. Here, too, the cleric can play a valuable role. Holding up for admiration and emulation the commanding examples of great contributors is something religious bodies do well, and their efforts in this regard should not be relaxed. The most urgent need, if the unbelieving scientist is to be a participant in religious affairs, is for a concept of God that is acceptable to him. If the writer now makes an attempt at such a formulation, he is aware of the presumption that the theologian may attribute to him. But religion cannot have it both ways; if it invites the participation and understanding of all people, it must be prepared to hear the results of the ensuing thought. Thus emboldened, I shall present my view of God that, I believe, can be accepted, and especially used, by both cleric and scientist. I shall present it in abbreviated, even though somewhat circuitous, fashion. When one thinks of what constitutes a morally good man, there appears to be universal agreement that he is characterized by beneficent actions toward himself and others. He is continuously oriented toward contributing to the security and happiness of people. In the cases of those whom he loves particularly well, their happiness and security are as important to him as his own. He is altruistic, but he also looks after himself and is not masochistic. He tends to bind people together into groups, and does not divide them from each other. His goodness, when he thinks about it at all, is based on the firm knowledge and conviction that people can survive only in a companionship with each other that invites trust and love. Decision-making is easier for him when his actions are determined by the welfare of people. This is the guiding principle of his daily behavior. However, in his customary rounds through life, the good person is not consciously preoccupied in continuing fashion with the idea of performing charitable acts directed at specific people; this has become automatic and recedes into the background of his thinking. He has an occupation to which he devotes his talents, abilities, and energies, and his activities are characterized by their social acceptability. Works that are stamped as socially acceptable can be loosely divided into two main categories; either they produce utilitarian devices or they add beauty to life. These are the products of the good man, and they are promoted for the welfare of people. In all the long history of man, his goodness has brought innumerable and</page><page sequence="7">The Dichotomy of Man: Religion vs. Science 157 monumental benefits to humanity. This view does not mean to ignore the clear fact that man is an ambivalent creature who hates as well as loves and who has done much harm, but the emphasis is here placed on his goodness. This goodness is alive today and its constructive results continue to confer beneficences upon mankind. Moreover, it is justifiable, if history is to judge, that the goodness of man be expected to continue into the future. This is the basis of the hope and trust that the physician hears almost every day of his life. Whenever there is a chronic illness for which current therapeutic procedures are relatively ineffectual, either the patient or his relatives are likely to express the view that medical research may produce some new remedial process in the near future. This expectation of the continuing goodness of man has received much substantive justification. It is the summative concept of all the goodness of all men, past, present, and future, that I subsume under my view of God. God is a condensed expression for all of the goodness intrinsic to all men of all times. This God has produced such benefits as properly may be labeled miracles. It is even appropriate that such a God be described in anthropomorphic terms, since he is the product of man. He is also properly viewed, with only a little looseness of thought to be clarified further below, as the Creator of man, since surely it is the goodness of man that has brought him to his present state. Prayer to such a God is very understandable; it is the effort to find that feature of the goodness of man that is needed for the present exigency. It is the trust in the continuing goodness of man that has given rise to the picture of immortality; this goodness is not expected to die out. When one views the accomplishments of man, available as the property of all, it is easy to attribute omniscience and omnipotence to mankind and to God, but not to any individual man. All this must sound like a far cry from what Paul Tiliich has described as "the power and majesty of the God of both classical Judaism and classical Christian ity."17 It cannot appear very palatable to the theologian at first taste. Yet let us listen to the thoughts of another theologian: "The human artist is 'filled with the spirit of God to work in all manner of workmanship, to devise skillful works, to cut in gold, silver, brass, and in cutting of stones, and in carving of wood' (Exodus 31: 3-5). All this varied ability, the gift of God, constitutes man's wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, and is but a meager reflection of the divine wisdom which operates with all sorts of materials to fashion its manifold works."18 Is this so different from what has been said above? It requires elucidation of what was referred to above as "looseness of thought": Whenever extreme intimacy and mutuality exist between two individuals, the direction of flow of a transaction between them is immaterial; each shares the experience of the other. When a mother nurses her infant, she loses the boundary between herself and her child, and the suckling surely feels that the mother is part of himself. When a man and woman, deeply in love, engage in sex relations, there is such a fusion of body and ego boundaries that the one does not know where he leaves off and the other begins. In this sense it is of no significance whether God or man is the Creator; both are true.</page><page sequence="8">158 Journal of Religion and Health The intent of this essay is in no wise polemical. Mankind is divided in the sense that there are religious believers and nonbelievers, theologians and scientists who have had insufficient freedom of communication. The possible fate of the divided house is well known. It is difficult to serve two masters, but are they truly different? It is time for cordial relations and more intense efforts at mutual understanding. Here is an endeavor, faltering perhaps, in that direction. References 1. Bibby, C, T. H. Huxley.
