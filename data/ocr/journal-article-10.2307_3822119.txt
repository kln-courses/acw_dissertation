<plain_text><page sequence="1">145 THE ADOPTION OF ANKHNESNEFERIBRE AT KARNAK* By ANTHONY LEAHY A new edition of the stela (Cairo JE 36907) recording the adoption of Ankhnesneferibre as heiress to the god's wife of Amun at Karnak and her subsequent accession. The physical context in which the stela might have been set up, and the Theban environment of its composition are fully considered, as are the age of the princess and the Twenty-sixth Dynasty historical background. IN April 1904, in the now famous cachette at Karnak, Legrain discovered a statue of Ankhnesneferibre, daughter of Psammetichus II, and a stela recording her adoption as 'heiress' by Nitocris, daughter of Psammetichus I, and her subsequent enthronement as god's wife of Amun.' The text of the stela and a translation were published by Maspero in the same year2 and an English rendering by Breasted appeared very shortly after- wards.3 Although its value for chronology was immediately recognised and the main events it commemorates have been noticed, with varying degrees of emphasis, in general histories since then,4 there has been no subsequent edition of the stela5 and it has never attracted the attention accorded to the inscription which describes the adoption of Nitocris herself 60 years earlier.6 While it is not concerned with happenings as dramatic as those which form the backdrop to the latter inscription, the stela of Ankhnesneferibre is by no means without interest for the history of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. It provides *The visit to Cairo during which this text was first collated was made possible by a grant from the British Academy. I am grateful to Dr Mohammed Saleh and his colleagues in the Cairo Museum for access to the stela. I am also much indebted to Prof. H. De Meulenaere, who suggested a number of valuable improvements in readings and references. G. Legrain, 'Renseignements sur les dernieres decouvertes faites a Karnak', RT 27 (1905), 81-2. 2G.

It subsequently entered the Cairo Museum as JE 36907 and is currently on display in a case in the Late Period gallery.8 The stela is of alabaster, the different degrees of translucency of the stone giving a streaked effect to the surface, and its dimensions are 74 cm high by 42 cm wide and 13 cm thick. It was recovered in two pieces, and much of the text of the second half of the third line in particular is obscured or destroyed by the roughly horizontal break. Elsewhere, small portions of the text have become detached and been replaced; the surface is scarred and generally rather fragile. Apart from the third line, however, the inscription is not difficult to read. No certain traces of ancient colour survive; some red pigment on the top and spreading onto the front is probably not original. The incised area comprises an arc with figured decoration and fifteen lines of shallowly-cut hiero- glyphic text below it, reading from right to left (fig. 1 and pl. XII).9 At the top of the arc is an elongated and curved pt-sign, with stars inside, above a winged disk with elaborately-cut plumage. Below, two scenes are distinguished by their orientation, although not formally divided. On the left, facing inward towards Amun and Mut is a king Wahibre. He wears the atef-crown, a short, projecting kilt and the animal's tail, while extending his right arm towards the deities, and holding a mace and staff in his left hand. In return, Amun offers a slender fan as symbol of protection, and sed- festival emblems.10 On the right, the god's wife Ankhnesneferibre, wearing the character- istic two-feathered crown, uraeus and a voluminous garment, shakes sistra before Amun and Khonsu. Behind her is a slightly smaller figure, in short kilt and diaphanous longer overskirt, acting as fanbearer and identified as her chief steward Sheshonq.

The other Journal d'Entree number, 36750, attributed to it by Manuelian, Living in the Past, 403, belongs in fact to the basalt statue of Ankhnesneferibre (n. 2 above). 9Perhaps misled by Maspero's arrow indicators, Manuelian, Living in the Past, 62 fig. 17, includes this among the small number of Saite royal texts written from left to right.

On every occasion of her going to the temple of Amun at his every festival of appearance, there shall come to her prophets and god's fathers and the priesthood of the temple.'ff Notes on readings and translations"1 (a) The king has sometimes been identified as Psammetichus I (PM II2, 166; Manuelian, Living in the Past, 6), presumably because the nsw bity title traditionally precedes a prenomen. However, it is clear from the four dates in the text, two from the reign of Psammetichus II and two from that of Apries, that the Wahibre depicted in the arc must be Apries, in whose reign the stela was actually carved, here designated by his nomen. (b) The orientation of these two columns is the reverse of that expected, since the words must be those of Amun. (c) Maspero read &lt; (sic!) here. Although the signs are small and not well carved, one can nevertheless read = , completing the toponym 'Isrw. (d) It is not quite clear where these two texts, 'who gives all life, stability and dominion', belong. I have taken them as continuing the legends of Mut and Khonsu respectively, but they could be an extension of the Bhdty text just above. (e) The same text is given in both directions, with a central cnh common to both. This ankh itself stands directly beneath the disk, and immediately above the nbt common to the epithets of Mut and Khonsu. (f) Here and in 1. 7, probably also in 1. 5, the word 'year' is spelt with-' rather than Maspero's , as often in the Libyan to Saite Periods: see A. Leahy, 'Two Donation Stelae of Necho II', RdE 34 (1982-3), 80 a, for references. Other examples from the mid-Twenty-sixth Dynasty can easily be added: Louvre A.83, temp. Necho II (J. Yoyotte, Dictionnaire de la Bible, Supplement, fascicule 31 (1958), 368 and fig. 609, and 0. Perdu, 'Prologue 'a un corpus des steles royales de la XXVIe dynastie', BSFE 105 (1986), 24-6 incl. fig. 1); the Tanlis stela of Psammetichus II (Manuelian, Living in the Past, pls. 8, 18, the latter a drawing including a previously unpublished fragment); a donation stela from the reign of the same king, Cairo JE 36863 (D. Meeks, 'Les donations aux temples dans l'Egypte du ler millenaire avant J.-C.', in E. Lipiniski (ed.), State and Temple Economy in the Ancient Near East (OLA 6; Leuven, 1979), II, 677 no. 26.3.3); another from the reign of Apries, Moscow I.l.a.5645 (S. Hodjash and 0. Berlev, The Egyptian Reliefs and Stelae in the Pushkin Museum of Fine Art, Moscow (Leningrad, 1982), 173 no. 114). (g) For another example of the numeral 'one' written with a kink at the top, also found in 1. 7, see E. Graefe and M. Wassef, 'Eine fromme Stiftung fur den Gott Osiris-der-seinen-Anhanger- in-der-Unterwelt-rettet aus dem Jahre 21 des Taharqa (670 v. Chr.)', MDAIK 35 (1979), 104 and pl. 17, line 1. (h) The -t attached to mnh is superfluous. Here and in 1. 9, the mnhj-sign is shown facing in the wrong direction in Maspero's version. (i) Maspero omitted a a beneath the ankh-sign at the end of 1. 2. In 1. 14, the third person singular feminine stative ending appears as | . (j) Here and in 1. 9, the stela yields two examples of the sdm pw ir(w).nf construction. Although the first has a -t ending to the irw.n.f which might suggest that the antecedent was understood as feminine, neither has the classical -t ending for the weak verb infinitive, which is consistent with Late Egyptian treatment of it as masculine. Only two instances of this construc- tion are found in the corpus studied by Manuelian, Living in the Past, 136-7, 291 n. 686, but there 11I have not commented on the numerous misgroupings in Maspero's presentation of the text, which mostly derive from the limitations of the hieroglyphic font used. 1996 149</page><page sequence="6">ANTHONY LEAHY are others in, for example, the 'Saite' stela fragment from Behtim (E. Naville, The Mound of the Jew and the City of Onias (MEEF 7; London, 1890), pl. xxi.12, 1. 5) and on the sarcophagus of Ankhnesneferibre (I. Nagy, 'Remarques sur le souci d'archaisme en Egypte a l'Epoque Saite', Acta Antiqua 21 (1973), 60 n. 86). (k) Whereas spr in 1. 1 can be taken as a narrative infinitive, spr.sn here must be a sdm.f, probably nominal, expressing the past in a main clause: Manuelian, Living in the Past, 193 ff. There are other examples below. In the adverb phrase that follows, the sense is clear even if the reading is doubtful. The grouping is ~ rather than with the disk centred as in Maspero. Maspero read m sp wr, but there are no internal markings to the circle, so * is a possible alternative. The lost sign balancing it above the harpoon-sign above could be n, rather than o, yielding m ht wf(t). (1) rhr.n sdm.f is passive here and perhaps also in 1. 6-7. The only use of this auxiliary form in the Saite royal inscriptions studied by Manuelian, Living in the Past, 279-80, is on the fragmentary Tanis stela of Psammetichus II. At first glance (cf. n.(j)), this might suggest a particular fondness for literary forms in the author of Ankhnesneferibre's text, but such an inference is subject to caution. Although Manuelian's study greatly facilitates the evaluation of Twenty-sixth Dynasty royal stelae, the corpus remains a very small and possibly unrepresentative one. A measure of this is the occurrence of the construction rhr.n sdm.f three times on a very small fragment of an inscription from Edfu, recording a Nubian campaign of either Psamme- tichus I or II (L. Habachi, 'Psammetique II dans la region de la premiere cataracte', Or Ant 13 (1974), 325); cf. also the Elephantine stela of Amasis (G. Daressy, 'Stele de l'an III d'Amasis', RT 22 (1900), 2 col. 18). (m) Read st; p; [hnty?] m pr 'Imn .... irw. Maspero did not translate this, but Breasted seems to me to have established the essence of the passage in his version: 'Then was conducted the [divine] [image] from [the House of] Amon, to...in order to make her titulary as follows:'. Breasted's suggestion of hnty? as the word for 'image' was tentative, the signs being quite unclear; the verb st; does, however, favour a statue that was pulled on a sled rather than one carried in a sacred boat. The reference would be to oracular approval of the titulary. (n) ir(r)y: I take this as an unusual writing of the infinitive, paralleled for this period on the Tanis stela of Psammetichus II (Manuelian, Living in the Past, 214), and assume that the governing preposition r has coalesced with the preceding irw. Classical Middle Egyptian does occasionally show a -y ending and writing out of r in the passive sdm.f (Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar3 , §420), but the latter form appears as ir without either feature several times later in the present text. For nhb(t), '(royal) titulary', here and in 1. 13, see M.-A. Bonheme, 'Les designations de la «titulature»&gt; royale au Nouvel Empire', BIFAO 78 (1978), 347-60; M. Gitton, 'Variation sur le theme des titulatures de reines', BIFAO 78 (1978), 401. The term, which usually designates the five titles of the king, is here extended to the god's wife of Amun, and it may not be coincidental that this passage gives Ankhnesneferibre five titles or epithets. (o) This is the only example of this epithet given by Troy, Patterns of Queenship, 185 A4/11. The determinative of rht is r,i not ra , pace Maspero. The reference must be to (some part of) the temple, the 'divine palace' (Wb. I, 214, 8). rht here shows the feminine ending it often has in the first millennium (Wb. I, 214, 22; R. A. Caminos, The Chronicle of Prince Osorkon (Rome, 1958), 83 (r); S. Sauneron, 'Remarques de philologie et d'etymologie (en marges des textes d'Esna)', in Melanges Mariette (BdE 32; Cairo, 1961), 231-2; Manuelian, Living in the Past, 350 n. 233), rather than a 'superfluous' -t. (p) Breasted did not translate this passage. Troy, Patterns of Queenship, 196 D2/5, has no parallels among the epithets attested for queens and god's wives. She reads p; rwy n sn n 'Imn, and translates 'Governess of the arms of the encirclement of Amun', but the text clearly has 8 and not 2 . Maspero's suggestion, 'celle qui marche a la tete de la lignee (?) d'Amon', brings out the etymology of h;wty, and the sense of 'leader of a procession' may be appropriate here. The crux of the second part of the epithet, p; rrn n 'Imn, is not known to me elsewhere in this form. Neither context nor determinative suggests a connection with ifn, 'baboon', whereas reasonable 150 JEA 82</page><page sequence="7">THE ADOPTION OF ANKHNESNEFERIBRE sense is obtained by deriving it from the rare crrny, known only from campaign texts of the New Kingdom (Wb. I, 170, 1-2; R. 0. Faulkner, Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian (Oxford, 1962), 39). It appears there as a noun (det. cTJ), meaning 'enclosure', and as a verb (det. i), with the sense of 'confine'. See further W. Helck, Urkunden der 18. Dynastie. Ubersetzung zu den Heften 17-22 (Berlin, 1961), 36; James K. Hoffmeier, 'Tents in Egypt and the Ancient Near East', Newsletter SSEA 7/3 (May, 1977), 16; P. Der Manuelian, Studies in the Reign of Amenophis II (HAB 26; Hildesheim, 1987), 224, 228. The determinative used here is appropriate enough to this general sense. However, as it is not normally used for words to do with building, and as the word does not seem to occur elsewhere in the lexicography of temple architecture, it may refer to an abstract notion rather than to a physical structure such as the precinct of Karnak. (q) The determinative A for hs suggests this translation. (r) Sander-Hansen erroneously has 'day 24'. (s) line 6: Maspero introduced an imaginary and incomprehensible i after ;bh m, and miscopied the w of sw as the quail chick rather than the coiled rope. That the former was an error has been surmised by W. Schenkel, 'Beitrage zur mittelagyptischen Syntax', ZAS 92 (1965), 70 n. 2. The description of a royal death occurs again with reference to Nitocris in 1. 8 with only minor graphic variations (hnm.f/.s m and m ir sw/s(t)); the stative ending of ;bh is not modified despite the feminine reference. The close similarity between this and earlier descriptions of the death of kings in the story of Sinuhe and the Eighteenth Dynasty Theban tomb of Amenemhab has also been commented on by Manuelian, Living in the Past, 6-7. The earlier passages read: shr.f r pt hnm m itn hrw ntr ;bh m ir sw. Among the differences in the Saite version, Manuelian notes the use of initial pri instead of shr, and the fact that pt is spelt in Late Period fashion (?). There is also the substitution of a circumstantial sdm.f for the stative hnm of the earlier versions. The two earlier versions are decidedly closer to each other than either is to the present text. Nonetheless, there must be a connection. This might be seen as evidence that the text of Sinuhe was extant in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (Schenkel, ZAS 92, 70). This would fit with the view of N.-C. Grimal, 'Bibliotheques et propagande royale a l'epoque ethiopienne', in J. Vercoutter (ed.), IFAO Livre du centenaire (1880-1980) (Cairo, 1980), 37-48, esp. 42, and La stele triomphale de Pi(cankh)y au musee du Caire (MIFAO 105; Cairo, 1981), 284, 350), that there are numerous quotations from Sinuhe in Twenty-fifth Dynasty monumental texts; for the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, see also Nagy, Acta Antiqua 21, 56 n. 31. A more cautious view is taken by J. Baines, both on this passage ('Interpreting Sinuhe', JEA 68 (1982), 32 n. 12), and on the general point ('Literacy and Ancient Egyptian Society', Man 18 (1983), 585). He does not discuss the Ankhnesneferibre stela, but suggests that Amenemhab and Sinuhe may have a common source in stock terminology, a conclusion also contemplated by Manuelian. The appropriate inference is surely that all three passages are quoting a standard euphemism for the death of kings, somewhat modified with the passage of time and here extended to the god's wife. The use of pri instead of shr invites comparison with the records of contemporary Apis burial: cf. pr.n hm n ntrpn r pt (stela of Year 12 of Apries, cf. stela of Year 20 of Psammetichus I; see n. 13). At all events, this should be distinguished from the similar phraseology used to describe the merging of the god's wife with Amun during her lifetime, such as sm'yt m hcw ntr or hnm m 'Imn: L. A. Christophe, Karnak-Nord III (1945-1949) (FIFAO 23; Cairo, 1951), 46; J. Leclant, Recherches sur les monuments thebains de la AXVe dynastie dite ethiopienne (BdE 36; Cairo, 1965), 369. (t) On shr, 'cause to appear', with particular reference to formal, processional appearance, see J.-M. Kruchten, Le grand texte oraculaire de Djehoutymose (MRE 5; Brussels, 1986), 77-8. Or is this the intransitive use of shr, 'appear in glory', which has been recognised for the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (Wb. IV, 237, 19-20; Grimal, La stele triomphale de Pi(rankh)y, 68-70 n. 174)? (u) rnh.ti stands instead of the rnh dt which one expects to follow the name of a king, an error perhaps influenced by the cartouche of Nitocris earlier in the text. 1996 151</page><page sequence="8">ANTHONY LEAHY (v) The description of Nitocris as mcr-hrw whereas the longer dead Psammetichus II is not so called despite the identical context is an inconsistency of a kind which undermines confidence in any argument based on the presence or absence of the epithet (see below, p. 160). (w) 'Twelve days', as read by Maspero, seems certain despite a chip in the stone, but Maspero then recorded 'day 16', whereas the text clearly has '15'. He was perhaps influenced by the fact that 4 smw 15 is only eleven days later than 4 smw 4, unless parts of both the first and last days are counted separately. (x) The legs of the biliteral sm are clearly detached here, pace Maspero; contrast the normal writing in 1. 15. This unusual spelling is not given in Wb. IV, 462. At the end of 1. 9, Maspero copied a nb-basket instead of the n beneath ir. (y) Maspero, ASAE 5, 87, followed by Graefe, Untersuchungen II, 90, read and translated 'nine' priests here, but, as De Meulenaere points out to me, the correct reading is 'great wab-priests', paralleling 'great courtiers' in the previous line.

Commentary Context and composition The physical aspects of the stela and its setting are worth considering briefly. The choice of alabaster is unusual, but has no obvious significance. The original context in which the stela was erected is unknown. The basalt statue of Ankhnesneferibre found with it was of approximately the same height and they may have been created at the same time to stand together, as Legrain and Maspero suggested.12 At 74 cm high, the stela is modest '2Legrain, RT 27, 81-2; Maspero, ASAE 5, 90. 152 JEA 82</page><page sequence="9">1996 THE ADOPTION OF ANKHNESNEFERIBRE 153 in size-larger than the majority of funerary or donation stelae of the time, but smaller than, for example, the official Apis stelae of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty.13 It is decidedly smaller than most of the commemorative stelae issued by the kings of the dynasty, and would have been dwarfed by the adoption stela of Nitocris, which at 1.45 m is three and a half times wider, and was originally perhaps four times as high.14 The discrepancy in size does not preclude their once having stood close to each other nor does the fact that the Nitocris stela was found near the shrine of Seti II in the first court at Karnak, whereas Ankhnesneferibre's monuments were buried in the cachette beneath the court north of the seventh pylon. The latter objects were relatively portable, whereas a red granite stela weighing an estimated 6000 kilos15 would not have been moved lightly. The Nitocris monument was therefore probably erected in the first court, where other Saite stelae fragments-of Psammetichus II and perhaps Necho II-have been found.16 Both Legrain and Caminos thought that Nitocris' stela had an architectural setting, although neither offered a specific suggestion as to where this might have been. The former certainly, and perhaps Caminos, envisaged the original form of the stela as a rectangular slab. Legrain's idea, based on the observation of a presumed bolt-hole on one edge of the stela, was that it formed 'le montant gauche d'une porte monumentale'.17 Caminos deduced from the fact that only the front of the stela had been smoothed that it was 'a panel embedded in a wall'.18 Yet Egyptian door-jambs normally had vertical columns of text, not horizontal lines, while the back and sides of a free-standing stela were not usually given the smooth final finish reserved for the area to be carved.19 In my view, it remains most likely that the stela of Nitocris was originally a free-standing, 13The heights of the extant official stelae of the period are as follows: Year 20 Psammetichus I, 0.49 m; Year 52 Psammetichus I, 1.05 m; Year 16 Necho II, 1.05 m; Year 12 Apries, 0.87 m; Year 23 Amasis, 1.07 m. The figures are taken from M. Malinine et al., Catalogue des steles du Serapeum de Memphis (Paris, 1968), 146, and E. Chassinat, 'Textes provenant du Serapeum de Memphis', RT 22 (1900), 20-1, 166-7. Note, however, that, when complete, the Tanis stela of Psammetichus II was about the same size as Ankhnesneferibre's (Manuelian, Living in the Past, 365). 14The view expressed by Caminos, JEA 50, 71, that 'There is no way of ascertaining how much is lost at the top', is unduly pessimistic. If one assumes that this was a conventional round-topped stela, a rough calculation can be made. A height-width ratio of approximately 2:1 characterises Saite royal stelae. The Saqqara VII stela of Psammetichus I measures 1.96 X 1.01 m, the Shellal stela of Psammetichus II 2.55 X 1.23 m, the Memphis stela of Apries 3.14 X 1.58 m (Manuelian, Living in the Past, 323, 337, 373 respectively): the other Saqqara stelae of Psammetichus I are 2.20 X 1.09 m (Perdu, BSFE 105, 29). The Elephantine stela of Amasis is somewhat smaller at 1.75 X 0.95 m (Daressy, RT 22, 1). The 1.45 m width of the Nitocris stela would therefore imply an original height of about 2.90 m, compared with its maximum preserved height of 1.88 m. In all the preserved examples except the Elephantine stela, the lunette occupies at least one third of the total height, which might suggest that only a few centimetres of the horizontal text have been lost from the inscription of Nitocris. As the average height of the lines on the stela is 5.7-6 cm (Manuelian, Living in the Past, 297), this may mean only one line. Given the length of the lines and the very compact and dense carving of the text (ibid. pl. 13), this could comfortably have accommodated a date formula and/or a titulary as well as a few words placing the king in his palace addressing his courtiers, which is all that is needed to complete the sense. A brief introduction of this kind begins the 'royal' stela dated to Year 1 of Necho II and held in front of the body on Louvre A. 83, a private stelephorous statue from Thebes (n.

Wherever it stood in the first court, it would have been a prominent symbol of both the establishment of Saite authority at Thebes, and the northern king's recognition of the prestige of Amun. It could well have served as a focal point around which related, if more modest, monuments such as the statue and stela of Ankhnesneferibre were subsequently clustered. The next question to consider is the kind of composition represented by Ankhnes- neferibre's stela. Manuelian includes it among 'Saite secular royal' inscriptions, although it is not one of those he studies in detail and he recognizes that it does not sit entirely comfortably in such company.20 The one respect in which it does is its language, which is the 'Saite Middle Egyptian' characteristic of the dynasty as a whole. It combines emulation of the classical phase of the language (sdm pw ir(w).n.f, rhc.n sdmf) with slight traces of Late Egyptian (definite article p;, feminine rht) and of orthography character- istic of the New Kingdom and later (mn;, pt). The avoidance of the sdm.n.f for past narrative is also noteworthy. Overall, the text fits well with Manuelian's hypothesis that the mid-Twenty-sixth Dynasty saw an increase in the use of literary forms, and a reduction in the Late Egyptianisms discernible in the Nitocris stela.21 In the treatment of the arc, however, the stela differs from most Saite royal stelae. From the reign of Psammetichus I through to that of Amasis, the king was usually not depicted, but represented emblematically by his Horus name in the serekh and by one or both cartouches, recalling Middle Kingdom practice.22 Parallels for the anthropo- morphic representation of the king seem to be limited to the reigns of Necho II and Psammetichus II, but include examples from Tanis and Tura as well as Thebes.23 This geographical spread combined with the concentration around the turn of the seventh to sixth century BC might imply a mid-dynasty fashion, but other stelae of Psammetichus II, including the records of his Nubian campaign at Shellal and Karnak, belong to the emblematic tradition24 and the corpus is too small to allow such an inference to be drawn with any confidence. The principal factor in determining the detail of the arc and the content of the text is the creation of Ankhnesneferibre's stela in a Theban workshop. It belongs, specifically, to a local iconographic tradition which was well-established by the early sixth century BC and well-represented in the numerous small Karnak chapels built in the joint names of the god's wife and the contemporary monarch. In these, balanced symmetrical scenes like 2°Living in the Past, 6-7, 57 n. 133, 62 fig. 17. 21 Living in the Past, 403-6. 22Several examples are illustrated in Manuelian, Living in the Past, pls. 2, 4-6, 7, 9-11.

The official Apis stelae of the dynasty exemplify both traditions: those of Year 16 Necho II and Year 12 Apries are emblematic, those of Year 20 Psammetichus I and Year 23 Amasis anthropomorphic, while the arc of the fifth (Year 52 Psammetichus I) was never carved: see n. 13 above for references. With rare exceptions, such as Cairo JE 36863 (n. (f) above), the donation stelae of the dynasty depict the king anthropomorphically. 154 JEA 82</page><page sequence="11">THE ADOPTION OF ANKHNESNEFERIBRE that on the stela, in which both appear before deities, were the standard way of conveying their shared responsibility for relations with the gods.25 Since the stela is a retrospective record of her initiation into the highest priestly office, Ankhnesneferibre's title in the arc is that of god's wife of Amun, and her whole name is written in a cartouche. The latter is just one of a number of indications in the inscription of a regal status practically indistinguishable from that of the pharaoh. Others include the use of words and phrases such as ntr, hmt, nsw, nhbt, inh dt-all normally reserved for the king-as well as the divine parentage expressed in the description of the death of Nitocris in terms identical to those used for Psammetichus II.26 The only indication of the pre-eminence of the monarch is the fact that it is Apries who is rewarded by Amun-Re for having ensured the smooth succession of his sister to shake the sistra before the god's face. A second feature of this Theban iconographic tradition is the depiction of the chief steward-here the newly-appointed Sheshonq A27-as a smaller figure standing behind the god's wife. The pose with fan is the characteristic expression of the relationship between the two from Akhamenru in the Twenty-fifth Dynasty onwards.28 Confirmation that the inscription records a Theban perspective on the events descri- bed is provided by comparison with the Nitocris stela. The latter begins with the king in council in the north as the central figure, initiating and controlling the sequence of events which follows. Its focus then shifts, first to a lively account of Nitocris' journey upstream, followed by her reception at Thebes by the incumbent god's wife and the local priesthood, and finally to the establishment of her legal rights and specification of her endowment. The latter probably amounted almost to a refoundation of the institution with funding from throughout the country and was a symbol of the king's generosity to Amun and, indirectly, to his priesthood. Its economic, social and political importance is reflected in the fact that fully half the inscription is devoted to an account of the provision made, with a degree of detail usually absent from monumental inscriptions. The view- point throughout is that of the royal court. It is the king's titulary that is given at length, not that of Nitocris, and he, through the donations he has himself provided or secured from others, remains the central figure. In the stela of Ankhnesneferibre, by contrast, the concerns are almost parochially Theban. At the time the text was composed, Ankhnesneferibre had just been inducted, so her arrival nine years earlier is mentioned only briefly in annalistic form, and there is no reference to any endowment. In the light of the dowries which accompanied ordinary members of the residence of Amun,29 it is highly probable that Ankhnes- 25 See, for example, Leclant, Recherches sur les monuments thebains, pls. viii, lxiii. 26On the various royal attributes of the god's wife under the Kushites, see Leclant, Recherches sur les monuments thebains, 374-83, and M.

The pose can also be found on stelae (BM 835, Sheshonq A?, PM II2, 194) and, in the case of Pabasa at least, in the tomb of the official in question: PM I2, 358 (12) and (17); for (12), see K.

Barguet's suggestion ('Un aspect religieux du grand-majordome de la Divine Adoratrice', BSFE 20 (1956), 7-9) that these scenes show the steward in the same relation to the god's wife as the royal ka to the king, reads into artistic symmetry a religious significance that is not warranted. 29J.

The two kings, her father Psammetichus II and her brother Apries, appear in the inscription only as datum points. Neither is credited with any active role, although the initial adoption of the princess must have been her father's decision, and her later later accession presumably required her brother's sanction. The emphasis of th the text is on the initiation at Thebes of the new incumbent-something almost entirely lacking from the Nitocris stela-and in that sense it continues the tradition of the Karnak priestly annals of an earlier period.30 The stelae have two things in common. The first is a concern to establish legal entitlement. In the Nitocris stela, this is represented both by Psammetichus I's insistence on respecting the rights of the existing heiress, and by reference to the drawing up of an imyt-pr for his daughter. In the Ankhnesneferibre text, it is the reason for the reference to her adoption nine years earlier, with which the inscription begins.31 The second common element-the description of the arrival of the princesses at Thebes- also emphasises the difference in perspective: the subdued, matter-of-fact retrospective account of Ankhnesneferibre's contrasts sharply with the detail of noise and jubilation of Nitocris' arrival. One is an administrative record, the other a celebration of national rejoicing. These differences in iconography and orientation reflect the different political circum- stances brought about brought about bseventy seventy years of Saite rule. They also suggest different compositional environments. Nitocris' text commemorated an event of epoch-making importance for the whole country and would have been composed at the king's court at Sais or Memphis. As a record of one of the great royal decisions, it was given a suitably magnificent permanent form. Copies of it may well have been set up in a number of temples with minor modifications to make it relevant to different local deities, as with Psammetichus II's Karnak and Shellal records of his Nubian campaign.32 The inscrip- tion on Ankhnesneferibre's monument was a Theban priestly creation, and the example we have is probably the only one ever carved. That the installation of a new god's wife, the first in over fifty years, and so the first in most people's lifetime, could seem to pass so quietly may be testimony to the success of the Saite kings in establishing their influence at Thebes, but it is also a function of the type of record to have survived. One cannot preclude the possible e future discovery of a stela commemorating in suitably glorious erms Psammetichus II's decision t send his daughter south, and presenting the matter in an entirely different light. 30Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs, 354-5, noted the way in which the text dwells on the installation of Ankhnesneferibre rather than her endowment. For the annals of the Theban priests, see Kruchten, Les annales des pretres de Karnak. 31 This has been noted by Sander-Hansen, Das Gottesweib, 30 and L.-A. Christophe, 'Les trois derniers grand majordomes de la XXVIe dynastie', ASAE 54 (1957), 88-9. 32Manuelian's juxtaposed comparison of the Karnak and Shellal texts (Living in the Past, 361-3) shows that the only significant difference occurs in col. 2 where the names of the deities differ according to site: the former is dedicated to the Theban, the latter to the Elephantine triad. In other respects, the Karnak version is identical where preserved, and must follow the same master layout. Both could have been carved at the granite quarries, then one sent north. 156 JEA 82</page><page sequence="13">THE ADOPTION OF ANKHNESNEFERIBRE Process of investiture Four stages are described: 1. Year 1, 3 smw 29 of Psammetichus II (= 13 December 595 BC): the arrival of Ankhnesneferibre at Thebes and her adoption as successor to Nitocris. 2. Year 7, 1 ht 23: the death of Psammetichus II followed by the accession of Apries (10 February 589 BC). 3. Year 4, 4 smw 4 of Apries: the death of Nitocris (16 December 586 BC). 4. Year 4, 4 smw 15: the installation of Ankhnesneferibre as god's wife (27 December 586 BC). These dates combine with Serapeum stelae data to provide the framework for early sixth century BC regnal transitions and for wider Saite chronology.33 The retrospective record of four distinct points in the adoption and succession procedure, covering a period of nine years from 595 to 586 BC, is reminiscent of contemporary Apis stelae, on which the birth, enthronement, death and burial of the bull are successively described.34 Ankhnesneferibre arrived at Thebes only twenty days after a new Apis had been brought to Memphis. Given that Nitocris had taken sixteen days to make a similar journey south, there is a remarkable degree of coincidence between these two events, which are the earliest recorded for the reign of Psammetichus II,35 and this may be testimony to the priority accorded them by the new king. The text of Ankhnesneferibre's stela represents the only written account extant from this period of the ritual aspects of the investiture of the god's wife. Ankhnesneferibre arrived at Thebes in 595 BC as a humble princess, s;t nsw (1. 2). After being greeted by her adoptive mother and taken to the temple, her acquisition of the titles of 'great songstress of the residence of Amun' and 'first prophet of Amun', as well as two epithets of lesser importance, was approved by the oracle of Amun (11. 3-5). The fact that the statue of the god was brought out implies a semi-public location for this confirmation. The text which describes the bestowing of the name of god's wife on the daughter of Ramses VI states that it took place in p; wb; r;.36 Conventionally translated 'forecourt', this term seems most often to refer rather to the area outside the temple proper but within the precinct or temenos, thus an area to which there would be general access, as befits the etymology of the word and the fact that petitions could be made there.37 33The Julian calendar dates follow the tables of Pestman (ed.), Les papyrus demotiques de Tsenhor I, 174-83. 34The Apis stelae (cf. n. 13 above) are not the only examples of the period with more than one date: the Nitocris stela (n. 6) preserves two, and probably had a third, while the Elephantine stela of Amasis (n. 14) and the Saqqara stelae of Psammetichus I (Perdu, BSFE 105, 27) both have two. 35The date of installation of the bull, recorded on the stela of Year 12 of Apries (Chassinat, RT 22, 167, xc) is Year 1, 3 smw 9 (23 November 595 BC). The two donation stelae of Psammetichus II's Year 1 (Meeks, in Lipiniski (ed.), State and Temple Economy II, 26.3.1 a and b) have no more precise date. I am grateful to Dr L. Limme for confirmation of this for the former, Brussels MRAH E. 8326; the latter, UC 14536, has now been published by H. M.

It may have been a common location for public pronouncements. 1996 157</page><page sequence="14">The two titles define her position, with responsibility for the household and for functions carried out by the previously male 'first prophet'. The first, held previously by Nitocris, placed her at the head of a body of women who were celibate devotees of Amun.38 The second represented a significant transference of priestly power to the hierarchy of the god's wife. Ankhnesneferibre is the first woman known to have held the title of first prophet of Amun, the only other certain female incumbent being her eventually-adopted heiress, Nitocris B, daughter of Amasis.39 The last-known previous bearer was Harkhebi, grandson of Shabako, who was among those who received Nitocris on her arrival at Thebes, and who is last attested in the Saite Oracle Papyrus of 651 BC.40 Exactly when this change occurred is uncertain. Both a period of vacancy and unattested male successors have been suggested for the half century between Harkhebi and Ankhnesneferibre.41 There is also an absolute minimum of seventeen years with no attested first prophet between the elevation of the latter in 586 BC and the appointment of Nitocris B as heiress in 569 BC at the earliest.42 The position could, however, have been held by unattested heiresses (see below) or have been retained by the god's wife herself when there was no heiress. It could even have been taken over by Nitocris A, if Harkhebi died before she became god's wife, and could have been mentioned in the broken beginning of Ibi's text. Whatever the case, the absorption of the title into the hierarchy of an institution linked personally to the crown built on measures taken by the Kushite pharaohs to reduce the powers of the office, and was an important stage in securing control of Thebes for the Saites.43 The kings of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty had weakened the local roots of the office by appointing from their own family, and had diminished its power-base by denying its holders the military function their predecessors had combined with it since the end of the New Kingdom.44 The relative decline in its importance at the advent of the Saites is apparent from the 'pecking order' of the Thebans listed as making donations to Nitocris, with Montuemhat and his family preceding the first prophet. This secondary status is subsequently evident from the fact that the title was not held by the god's wife herself, but by her subordinate. When Ankhnesneferibre went to the temple after the death of Nitocris in 586 BC, she was still only princess and 'first prophet of Amun' (11. 9-10), and she then underwent the initiation rituals appropriate to a god's wife at the hands of the scribe of the divine book and the wab-priests (11. 11-12).

This leads on to the next stage in Ankhnesneferibre's enthronement, in which she is said to be adorned with the regalia of a god's wife and divine adoratress, including the two-feathered crown, and given a new titulary, which consists of a series of epithets culminating in the titles, not previously held, of god's wife, divine adoratress and god's hand (11. 12-15). Significantly, at this point in the text, her whole name-and not just her father's component of it-was for the first time written in a cartouche, thus completing her transference to regal status.47 Comparison with the Nitocris stela fails at this point because, although Nitocris too set forth only as s;t nsw-albeit in her case designated as the 'eldest' (wrt) daughter and provided with a 'beautiful name' with the intention that she should eventually become god's wife-her induction as heiress is not described in ritual or titular terms. However, a partially preserved description of her later investiture on the Cairo statue of Ibi confirms the two distinct stages of the Ankhnesneferibre text. Nitocris is first referred to as 'great songstress of the residence of Amun'. This is followed by a clause which, though damaged, must describe her elevation to the position of divine adoratress of Amun (r hmt ntr dw;t ntr 'Imn).48 The scribe of the divine book again conducted the ceremony, accompanied on this occasion by lector priest, magician and various other priests. There is thus a sharp distinction which should not be blurred,49 rfhese texts indicate unequivocally that the status of the two princesses as heiress was formally different from their position after induction as god's wife, as, no doubt, were their responsibilities. There was only one god's wife at a time. This rules out the idea of an overlap in the exercise of power, a coregency in effect, between Nitocris and Ankhnesneferibre. This was suggested by Monnet on the basis of a bronze statuette with only partly preserved inscription, apparently dedicated by a northern official 'Ir-r;-n-Hr on behalf of his daughter when she became one of the songstresses of the residence of Amun.50 The text describes both Nitocris and Ankhnesneferibre as divine adoratress, and neither as mcr- hrw, while Ankhnesneferibre is also called god's wife. Monnet argued that this proved that the two held office at the same time, and consequently concluded that the stela of Ankhnesneferibre records only a confirmation of a state of affairs which already existed. But other explanations are possible. The statue base could have been dedicated early in 4 Christophe, Karnak-Nord III, 99-100, 102-3, pl. xlv, 36-40. 47As noted by Sander-Hansen, Das Gottesweib, 11 n. 2, and Vittmann, Or 44, 380 n. 39. 48Graefe, MDAIK 50, 87 1. 5, 96. 49Graefe, MDAIK 50, 97. 50J.

Her interpretation has been followed by Leclant, LA I, 264, and Gitton and Leclant, LA II, 799 n. 86. 1996 159</page><page sequence="16">the reign of Ankhnesneferibre on behalf of a songstress who had been initiated late in that of Nitocris, and therefore included both in the decoration. Or Nitocris could be mentioned simply because she was the adoptive mother and predecessor of Ankhnesne- feribre.51 The absence of mr-hrw is a criterion of dubious value (cf. n. (v) above), and is not sufficient in my view to outweigh the evidence of the stela. The age of the princess From 586 BC Ankhnesneferibre held the office of god's wife of Amun for over 60 years, being last depicted with Psammetichus III in the temple of Osiris Pameres at Karnak.52 Her age on appointment is unknown although her survival to 525 BC would of itself suggest that she was not very old when made heiress in 595 BC. Her name, 'Ankhnes- neferibre'-'Neferibre lives for her'-is interesting in this context. Like many other basiliphorous names of the period,53 it revives an earlier pattern, in this case of the Sixth Dynasty, although one which had been used once more recently, when one of the kings of the Libyan Period, probably Sheshonq III, named a daughter Ankhnessheshonq.54 Ankhnesneferibre is the only other later example known, and she was also the only member of the Saite royal family to have a basiliphorous as distinct from a merely eponymous royal name. Because it incorporates Psammetichus II's prenomen, her name could not have been bestowed before his accession. Ankhnesneferibre's journey to Thebes took place within the first seven and a half months of her father's reign, the period that separates the highest known date of Necho II, Year 16, 4 Mht 16 (5 May 595 BC),55 from the arrival of Ankhnesneferibre at Thebes in Year 1, 3 smw 29 of Psammetichus II (13 December 595 BC). If the name was given at birth, therefore, we have to envisage an infant only a few months old being sent hundreds of miles upstream. She would then subsequently have been installed as god's wife at the age of nine. Given the likely infant mortality rate in ancient Egypt, the appointment of offspring who had not yet passed through the most dangerous stages of early childhood is unlikely to have been normal, as it would have led to a succession of heiresses who died befores they could inherit.56 Political circumstances will have had a role to play, however, especially early in the reign of a king anxious to make his mark, and both a desire to ensure control of Thebes and a perceived threat from Nubia have been suggested as catalysts for the early date of Ankhnesneferibre's installation.57 It is not inconceivable that the near coincidence of his accession and the birth of a daughter, 51 Cf. Cairo JE 29251 bis (PM II2, 17), on which Shepenwepet II, Amenirdis II and Nitocris are all shown. Only the first of these is called m'r-hrw, although the lintel is dated by the depiction of the chief steward Padihorresnet to the end of the reign of Psammetichus I at the earliest (Graefe, Untersuchungen II, 80). One assumes Amenirdis II was long dead by then. 52PM II2, 19. 53H. De Meulenaere, Le surnom egyptien a la Basse Epoque (Istanbul, 1966). 54A.

It is similarly possible that the accession of Psammetichus II accelerated the identification and arrival at Memphis of a new Apis (cf. n. 35). YEA 82 160 ANTHONY LEAHY</page><page sequence="17">THE ADOPTION OF ANKHNESNEFERIBRE combined with the fact that Nitocris was by then 61 +x (where x= age at adoption), provided Psammetichus II with an opportunity which he was happy to seize and led him to despatch an unusually young child as heiress within months of his accession.58 The alternative, and on balance this is more likely, is that Ankhnesneferibre was an older child or adolescent in 595 BC, who was given a new name on the accession of the king or on his decision to appoint her. Renaming on, for example, marriage, may have been more common than is apparent, and two points can be made in favour of the hypothesis in this particular case. Firstly, there is the introduction and widespread use of a basiliphorous rn nfr as a secondary name among high officials in the reign of Psammetichus II.59 Against this, 'Ankhnesneferibre' is nowhere described as a rn nfr and no other name except the prenomen she took in 586 BC is known for her. Secondly, there is Yoyotte's suggestion that renaming accompanied entry to the group of songstresses of which Ankhnesneferibre's appointment as 'great songstress of the residence of Amun' made her head.60 The evidence is circumstantial, but Yoyotte was able to point to the frequency of the otherwise uncommon name Diesehebsed among the songstresses, as well as other individuals with the same name as a god's wife, or with a name expressing a wish in favour of one of the latter.61 Ankhnesneferibre's own name was copied among her retinue during her lifetime.62 Interestingly, the same name pattern, 'Ankhnes-KN', was also used in renaming in the Old Kingdom. The non-royal sisters who became the mothers of Merenre and Pepy II were both called Ankhnesmeryre after their husband Meryre Pepy I, presumably on marriage.63 A particularly relevant example of such a practice is the rn nfr recorded for Nitocris when she sailed south to Thebes, and which must have been bestowed in this connection. This was 'Shepenwepet', a name previously borne by two god's wives of different dynasties, otherwise rare and distinctively Theban.64 This rn nfr was probably a diploma- tic gesture on her father's part towards his new Theban subjects, and is not to be confused with the prenomen she subsequently took on elevation to the position of god's wife, which associated her with Mut as the consort of Amun. By contrast, if Ankhnes- neferibre is indeed a second name, this princess was given a name commemorating her own father rather than one redolent of the milieu into which she was passing.

Eyre et al. (eds), The Unbroken Reed. Studies in the Culture and Heritage of Ancient Egypt in Honour of A. F. Shore (London, 1994), 113 n. 69. 64The name 'Shepenwepet' was bestowed on a daughter of Osorkon III who became god's wife as Shepenwepet I, and on the Kushite princess Shepenwepet II before it was adopted by Nitocris. If it was a birth name in the first case, it is unlikely to have been so in the second. Two other bearers of it are known from monuments certainly or probably from Abydos. A stela published by A. Mariette, Catalogue generale des monuments d'Abydos (Paris, 1880), 482 no. 1279, records a songstress of Amun and mother of a scribe of an unnamed lord of the two lands. Another stela, Turin 1632, was dedicated by a daughter of a high priest of Amun Osorkon (P. Munro, Die spatagyptischen Totenstelen (Gliickstadt, 1973), 261, fig. 98; on this Osorkon, see Kitchen, TIP2, §485). An isolated earlier example seems to occur in a graffito copied by Daressy at Luxor, 'Notes sur les XXIIe, XXIIIe et XXIVe dynasties', RT 35 (1913), 133; for dating to the early Twenty-second Dynasty, see Kitchen, TIP2, §265. 1996 161</page><page sequence="18">practice was also different in the two cases. Nitocris' original name continued to be given precedence over her later one, whereas Ankhnesneferibre's secondary name supplanted her birthname completely. Whether these were infants, or merely children, they will have needed maternal care. The emphasis on the role of the adoptive mother in the inscriptions of the god's wives need not exclude a role for the natural mother. It may be, for example, that Mehitemwes- khet, mother of Nitocris, was sent south with her child. Although she does not feature on her daughter's adoption stela, she is mentioned in the text of Ibi concerning Nitocris' installation in 639 BC, and-if her monument at Medinet Habu is her tomb and not just a memorial chapel-her interment at Thebes so far from her husband at Sais seems best explained by the assumption that she accompanied Nitocris to Thebes and died there at a relatively early age.65 If Mehitemweskhet was also the mother of the future Necho II,66 a male child and prospective heir, her departure from court would be particularly remarkable in that it would seem to attach greater importance to her role as mother of the future god's wife than to her position as mother of the crown prince or indeed wife of the king. There may be a precedent in the Twenty-fifth Dynasty when Amenirdis I was accompanied from Napata to Thebes by her sister as well as her mother, who both then remained in Egypt.67 Ankhnesneferibre's mother, Takhuit, was also the mother of the heir to the throne, Apries, and she seems to have been buried at Athribis, perhaps her place of origin.68 If she went south with her daughter, therefore, her sojourn was not a permanent one. Mehitemweskhet is the only queen of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty for whom there is reason to suppose an interment south of Memphis.69 The historical background Also uncertain are the measures taken by the Saite kings to ensure a smooth succession at Thebes. Only three god's wives, and two other heiresses, are known for the Twenty- sixth Dynasty. Between them, the Kushite Shepenwepet II, daughter of Piye, Nitocris and Ankhnesneferibre held office for the whole period. The heiresses are the Kushite Amenirdis II, daughter of Taharqa, and Nitocris B, daughter of Amasis. It is not certain whether either succeeded to office. A case for Amenirdis having done so in the 640s has recently been made by Graefe.70 If Nitocris B did so at the very end of the dynasty or after the Persian invasion, when there was a hiatus in the Karnak monumental record, it was in a much reduced position.71 In any case, Nitocris and Ankhnesneferibre successively held the highest office for a combined period of at least 113 years. This 65That it was her tomb seems to be generally accepted (e.g. Kitchen, TIP2, §492; Vittmann, Or 44, 376 n. 11) but a modicum of caution is appropriate as no burial equipment was found. 66 For this question, see Yoyotte, Dictionnaire de la Bible, Supplement, 365, and Vittmann, Or 44, 376-7. The evidence urged, that Nitocris was snt nsw as well as s;t nsw, need imply no more than a half-sibling relationship with Necho II. 67S.

While there is no evidence that the Persians actually suppressed it, one may be sure they did not nourish it. JEA 82 162 ANTHONY LEAHY</page><page sequence="19">THE ADOPTION OF ANKHNESNEFERIBRE longevity, particularly combined with the 54 year rule of Psammetichus I, was undoubt- edly an asset in terms of stability for the dynasty, but it cannot have been foreseen. Nitocris, made heiress in 656 BC, had succeeded Shepenwepet II by 639 BC at latest. Although the exact date of her investiture is not known, Graefe has persuasively argued that it cannot have been long before Ibi's appointment as chief steward, which occurred on the third day of the third month of Akhet in Year 26 of Psammetichus I.72 Nitocris will then have been a young woman of 17 +x, whose father had governed Thebes only for a decade and a half, and only indirectly. His hold cannot have been entirely secure and the still relatively new dynasty ought to have felt an urgent need to ensure a smooth succession in the south most strongly.73 By the time of Necho's accession in 610 BC, Nitocris was 46 + x, yet on the evidence we have, no heiress was appointed until 595 BC. Psammetichus I had nearly 30 years in which to act, and at least one daughter other than Nitocris, while Necho II had 16 years and at least three daughters.74 One possibility is that heiresses were appointed by either or both of these kings, but either died young or were displaced. That they are unattested would not be surprising since although incumbents may be shown with their predecessors, heiresses do not seem to have been represented on monuments before they took office as god's wife. Nitocris B, for example, may have occupied the position of heiress for some forty years if, as the circumstances of Amasis' seizure of the throne made desirable, she was appointed early in his reign. She is nonetheless only known for certain from two objects.75 Similarly, Nitocris A and Ankhnesneferibre are not attested before accession to the position of god's wife except on their adoption stelae. It has been suggested that Amasis might have put aside an unknown daughter of Apries in installing his own daughter Nitocris B.76 The same fate for a daughter of Necho II could be consistent with the evidence for the unexplained replacement of the latter's name by that of his son, Psammetichus II, on a number of monuments,77 although this would mean that the latter removed his own sister from her position. Particularly intriguing here is the fact that the earliest dated inscription of Necho's reign evidently recorded some decision of his concerning Thebes.78 Unfortunately, it is reported to be too damaged to yield much detail, but one element could have been the appointment of an heiress. Alternatively, it may be that there were no such appointments, in which case we need to consider what factors might explain what would seem to be a curious neglect of their own interests on the part of Psammetichus I and Necho II. The ability of the kings to appoint heiresses will have been constrained by the availability of daughters and by 72MDAIK 50, 96-7. 73On Psammetichus I and Thebes, see H. De Meulenaere, 'La statue du general Djed-ptah-iouf-ankh (Caire JE 36949)', BIFAO 63 (1965), 28-32. 74Vittmann, Or 44, 378. 75 De Meulenaere, JEA 54, 186. 76De Meulenaere, JEA 54, 187; see Graefe, Untersuchungen I, 11 on this and on the expectation that each king would want to install a daughter. 77For recently identified instances and references to earlier literature, see M.

This date of Year 1, 4 prt 11 corresponds to 31 August 610 BC, and, following the new interpretation of the eclipse recorded as having marked the death of Psammetichus I proposed by M. Smith, 'Did Psammetichus I die abroad?', OLP 22 (1991), 101-9, would be some five months into Necho's reign. 1996 163</page><page sequence="20">whatever conventions applied to the office of god's wife. What is known of the Twenty- sixth Dynasty royal family has been well summarised by Vittmann.79 There are, however, several questions which cannot be resolved on the basis of the evidence at our disposal but which nonetheless need to be aired because they affect perceptions of the period and the role of individuals. No clear statement of the conventions governing the appointment of the god's wife has survived.80 The distinctive requirement was one of celibacy. That girls could be dedi- cated as heiresses at an early age has been inferred from the advanced ages at death of the two Saite incumbents, both 70 + x, and from the celibacy factor, but nothing precise is known of any age limits. The requirement to be celibate may well have meant that appointment at puberty was the norm and made daughters who had passed that age when a vacancy occurred ineligible. The example of Nitocris, who was st nsw wrt, with a mother who was hmt nsw wrt tpt, might suggest an ideal according to which the first-born or eldest surviving daughter of the chief wife, if such there were, was appointed. But such arrangements could be overthrown by the lack of such an ideal, or by lack of a vacancy at the right time, although Psammetichus's appointment of Nitocris in 656 BC when there was already an heiress shows that even a lack of vacancy was not an insuperable obstacle to a determined king. Long reigns are particularly likely to result in the breakdown of patterns of succession, and what may have been a genetic tendency to longevity in the fafamily of Psammetichus ictndicated by the himself must have reached the age of 75, while his daughter and greatgranddaughter both passed 70-is an important factor.81 Finally, since no king is known to have appointed more than one daughter to be god's wife, the possibility that there was a convention against such a practice might be envisaged as an explanation for Psammetichus I not appointing an heiress to Nitocris. The available pool of candidates will have been affected by three factors: 1. The size of the family. It is not known whether Saite kings had several contempora- neous wives and thus the possibility of generating large families on the scale of their New Kingdom predecessors. Only Amasis is known to have had more than one wife, and given his maturity at accession and 44 years of rule, these could have been consecutive. The title hmt nsw wrt tpt,82 attested for the only known wives of Psammetichus I and II, may imply the existence of others, whose subordinate position makes them less likely to be recorded. However, the highest number of children attested is only four, for Necho II and Amasis. In Necho's case, all four are named on a statue of their tutor.83 If that 790 Or 44, 375-87. 80 For the general picture, see the survey of Yoyotte, BSFE 64, 31-52. 81Yoyotte, BSFE 64, 50, concludes the study in which he identifies a sequence of six god's wives between the New Kingdom and the Kushite Period by suggesting that fifty years may have been the average tenure of the incumbents, and that their freedom from the dangers of numerous births and (perhaps) their quiet lifestyle, as well as the young age at which they were adopted, explained such regularly long reigns. The childbirth aspect is certainly important, but the documentation on these women is less substantial than for the Kushite and Saite successors, the list is almost certainly incomplete, and we do not have direct information on their ages or length of tenure. The fact that the two Saite princesses held office for almost twice as long as their two Kushite predecessors suggests an additional factor specific to their family. 82This title is not common: Troy, Patterns of Queenship, 194 C2/9, has earlier examples only from the Twenty- first and Twenty-fifth Dynasties. 83R. el-Sayed, 'Quelques eclaircissements sur l'histoire de la XXVIe dynastie, d'apres la statue du Caire CG.658', BIFAO 74 (1974), 35-6. ANTHONY LEAHY JEA 82 164</page><page sequence="21">THE ADOPTION OF ANKHNESNEFERIBRE represents the total number at that time, rather than simply defining the limits of one tutor's responsibility, it would indicate a very small family compared with some kings of earlier periods. Yet royal children other than the intendencyd heir have a t oen invisibility throughoghout Egyptian history. The large families of Rameses II and III and even Herihor are known from collective temple representations, not individual monu- ments. Individual scions of the Libyan dynasties are better attested precisely because they were entrusted with priestly or military offices, a practice largely abandoned by the Twenty-sixth Dynasty with the notable and easily-explicable exception of the post of god's wife of Amun. 2. The age of family members at crucial times. The starting point must be that Psammetichus I was old enough to be a ruler in his own right under the Assyrians and so to father children.84 If Necho II was hs his eldest son,85 or at least one of te eldest, then he could have been born as early as 664 BC, been 54 on accession and 70 at death. In that case, Psammetichus II could have been born in the mid-640s BC and himself 50 on accession in 595 BC. Given the evidence for longevity in the family, this is quite conceivable. However, long reigns such as that of Psammetichus I must often have meant the death of intended heirs before that of the reigning king.86 If Necho II were born in the middle of his father's reign, then both he and Psammetichus II could have been much younger than just suggested. The ages of their offspring at any given point are thus not easy to calculate. 3. The marriage practices of the dynasty. There is no evidence for 'incestuous' marriage, the two wives whose origins are known being from outside the royal family.87 This might be partly explained by the fact that senior females were channelled into the position of god's wife. Although the marital status of most Saite princesses is unknown, it seems likely that the kings' need to maintain support through alliances would have meant that not all daughters could be kept celibate as prospective god's wives. One princess is known to have married into an influential Heracleopolitan family, a second into the Theban priesthood,88 while a role for others in royal diplomatic policy is suggested by Herodotus' confused story about the marriage of a daughter of Apries or Amasis to either Cyrus or Cambyses.89 In this state of uncertainty, no clear conclusion is possible on the appointment of heiresses in the period from 639 to 595 BC. Both Psammetichus I and Necho II should have wanted to install a successor to Nitocris, and they may have done so, but one can also imagine a combination of circumstances which prevented them from carrying out such a wish. 84 Petrie, History of Egypt 1112, 339. 85Yoyotte, Dictionnaire de la Bible, Supplement, 365, argues for Necho II as Psammetichus I's eldest son because he shared the name of his grandfather, but this could be a 'replacement' name. 86Vittmann, Or 44, 377 n. 15. 87Vittmann, Or 44, 376 (Mehitemweskhet, wife of Psammetichus I) and 379 (Takhuit, wife of Psammetichus II). 88Vittmann, Or 44, 383: Tasherientaihet and Diesehebsed. 89Herodotus III, 1-4; cf. also his account of the marriage of Amasis and a Cyrenian princess (II, 181). 1996 165</page><page sequence="22">PLATE XII Cairo JE 36907: The stela of Ankhnesneferibre THE ADOPTION OF ANKHNESNEFERIBRE AT KARNAK (pp. 145-65)</page></plain_text>
