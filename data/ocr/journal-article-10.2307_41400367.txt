<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Judith Kitchen The Woods Around It* What is nature to the poet? One well-known answer is given in Wallace Ste- vens' "Anecdote of the Jar," where the natural is set against the human; it is what art gives shape to, dominates. In recent years, this modernist aesthetic has been subject to waves of revision and rejection- almost as if it accounts for the twentieth-century despoilment of our environment. Yet the truth it con- tains may not be so easy to reject. Stevens shows us that nature is our own invention. We create its meaning(s); in fact, the very meaning of Stevens' poem derives from our ability to differentiate between the "slovenly" wilder- ness and the perfect roundness of the jar. Whatever value we give to nature's haphazard sprawl or to the evidence of human design remains subjective, but this duality is the source of tension in the poem. The jar "took dominion everywhere"- we can no longer see nature except in contradistinction to something else. As such, "nature"- whatever we mean by it- is a construction. Robert Frost, far more traditional than Stevens, has long been considered America's foremost "nature poet." But a quick examination of how nature functions in his poems also alerts us to the complexities (and pitfalls) of writ- ing about this subject. Maybe he does not so much write about it as to it- or, more precisely, against it. Painfully, belatedly, Frost achieved what so many contemporary "nature" poets seem to seek- wide recognition, even influence. Inevitably, his admittedly idiosyncratic engagement with nature ("I had a lover's quarrel with the world") must be taken into consideration by poets who follow him. If they don't wish merely to echo Frost, more recent poets must then carve out their own stance toward the material he popularized.

[145]</page><page sequence="2">146 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Frost's large shadow, can help us see in what ways each one may or may not be genuinely distinctive. The natural world offered Frost a referent and a place from which to begin his contemplation, but he was always careful to attribute his conclusion to the mind at work, not to nature itself. Often this was done with a quick, irreverent aside ("If design govern in a thing so small"), a wry realization ("I meant not even if asked / And I hadn't been"), a retreat from human interpretation ("One had to be versed in country things / Not to believe the phoebes wept"), or a hint at the brief, ephemeral overlap between the human and natural worlds ("And leave it there far from a useful fireplace / To warm the frozen swamp as best it could / With the slow smokeless burning of de- cay"). Frost's poetry refuses to attribute human qualities to nature; nature neither invites nor withholds- it simply is. Nature offered Frost metaphor as well. In this way, he was able to under- stand certain aspects of human behavior. Frost rarely used similes, preferring the sustained (and complicated) comparison of the extended metaphor; it was the movement of human thought rather than the representation of nature that interested him. He also used the enigma of the obvious. Such lines as "Then leaf subsides to leaf" carry with them the truth of the natural world and, at the same time, suggest something elusive for the mind to ponder: the par- ticular characteristics of the "early" leaf, the later. Against the fact of nature's indifference, Frost fashioned a man-made object-the poem- in which human meaning often emerges after an encounter with the natural world. The ac- tivity of discovering analogy is, in the end, what fascinates. This is best seen in the dialogue in "West-Running Brook": Our life runs down in sending up the clock. The brook runs down in sending up our life. The sun runs down in sending up the brook. And there is something sending up the sun. It is this backward motion toward the source, Against the stream, that most we see ourselves in, The tribute of the current to the source. It is from this in nature we are from. It is most us. This moment, or glimmer, of understanding was important to Frost. In another poem, "For Once, Then, Something," he defines it as the ability to see "beyond the picture / through the picture" to the "something" that is there, briefly- before the well-water ripples and "rebukes" the "too clear" water. In moments like these, the reader comes to his or her own understanding through Frost's use of nature as teacher . The lessons we learn are mediated by the human consciousness, so much so that there are times when the poet remains mystified, admitting that there are things in nature he is unable</page><page sequence="3">JUDITH KITCHEN I47 to comprehend. In Frost, this is not Romanticism, but a tough recognition of otherness- an otherness that is born of intimacy. At such moments, nature poses problems: "The woods around it have it- it is theirs." The ambivalent pronoun(s) in this well-known line from "Desert Places" have no clear referent. Even the basic poetic act of naming is stymied. The "it" remains a mystery- whatever "it" is, it belongs to the woods in a way that defies the human. In the face of such otherness, Frost seems will- ing to relinquish meaning. This is his ultimate legacy to poets who, today, seem almost frantic to impose meanings on the natural world. Sometime between Frost's death in 1963 and the present, our sense of nature changed. There is a new sense of literary obligation. Somehow writers must "save" nature, "renew," "preserve," "heal" nature, or at least be part of the effort. Their job, it seems, is to repair the rift: a whole new mythology has grown up, a mythology which purports to recapture a time when man and nature were more in tune with each other. This concept of nature as something apart from man is due, in part, to the country's shift from a rural to an urban (or suburban) society. But it is also a peculiarly American out- look: our history is brief enough that we can imagine we remember a life harmonious with the land; the rate of change is so rapid that we feel con- tinually nostalgic for even the recent past. This is at the root of the en- vironmental movement. In evolutionary terms, America condenses the longer histories of the inhabited world, accelerates the problems, predicts a future where we will experience "nature" only from the controlled confines of a theme park. Thus a new genre, nature writing, which is meant to be holistic, to make us aware of how we and nature are, in fact, one. I confess that I believe most of what I read in this genre, believe that every added parking lot in the Mississippi Basin threatens the city of New Orleans. Wetlands are disappear- ing-I can see that on my Sunday drives. Not just the spotted owls will be extinct, but a whole system. One has only to walk into rigid rows of carefully spaced pines to see that "reforestation" is a misnomer. But I do not believe that writing will save the forests or the owls. Writing can be a call to action, though it gets more and more difficult to make a noise from the printed page. Nature, this vast amorphous thing of which we believe we used to be an integral part, has become elevated in our discourse. It is now a destination . The "end" of nature looms before us as an image of apocalypse; we "go to it" to save ourselves. An idealized nature is an endangered nature. Almost a deity, nature no longer functions as it did for Frost- as a matter of daily encounter rather than an unreal, romanticized Other, the subject of appropriation by words as well as machines. In some current writings, "Nature" has become once again a source of Emersonian transcendence, has lost the integrity of its own</page><page sequence="4">148 THE GEORGIA REVIEW being. But the reality of this being is not so easily bent to human will- or imagination. People who wonder why we can't just all don crowns of daisies and love each other forget that, in nature, the snake eats the mouse, and you can watch as the one travels the other's long digestive length. How does nature function in contemporary poetry? Have contemporary poets resituated the self in nature with an intimacy as "natural" (note how this common adjective is itself a metaphor) as that which sustained Frost? Conversely, are we the inevitable heirs to Stevens' modernist dualism? Or have we gone past both into something new? For example, the Fall 1992 issue of Manoa presents a nature-writing symposium in which John A. Murray claims that nature writing is now "arguably the major genre in American literature." He goes on to say that there might be the possibility of "cross-fertilization" with the fatally antivernacular fiction and poetry of today. However, Mur- ray's reading is of so limited a range that he seems not to be aware that many serious fiction writers and poets (whom he calls "proudly aloof") never aban- doned nature; they may, in truth, have a more complex attitude than the "movement" calls for. Many current "nature writers," it seems to me, want to observe without fully owning the position of observer. They often abdicate the important roles of interpreter, commentator, assessor. Instead, they seem to feel that watching and describing a wolf at work is sufficient unto itself- that this is all it takes to restore the integrity of nature. Such writers apparently assume that the reader shares their belief that if writing is about the environment, it's important. But so often I'm left with the age-old question, "So what?" This is not a question one asks of Frost. Several recent books of poetry attest to the various ways the poet can present nature, even a nature removed from the quotidian, so as to engage and challenge the human mind. In Wildwood Flower, Kathryn Stripling Byer opens with an invocation that shows the present infused with a strong female spirit from the past. She goes on to create an alter-ego, Alma, who lives on a mountaintop in Appalachia at the turn of the century. Through her persona, Byer speaks of a time when nature was an integral part of daily living. The voice of this pioneer woman ranges from the angry to the ecstatic. Life is difficult- and lonely- but Alma makes do. Here nature is seen as both impediment and promise; the first poem in the book begins, "I hoe thawed ground / with a vengeance." Most of the poems contain a kind of harsh knowledge: "The mountains paid no atten- tion"; "No seed can root in snow"; "Rainbows end in the mud / where I come from." At the same time, there are glimmers of pleasure, as in "Ivory Combs"- a pleasure all the more intense because it is forged in hardship: The shady grass lay like a promise between us, ' concealing the first of its gay wings</page><page sequence="5">JUDITH KITCHEN 149 and meadow-sweet. "Gypsy girl," I heard him calling. I watched him come after me, crushing the wildflowers under his feet. Left by her husband (who follows his own "gypsy" urge to go west- ward), Alma works the hill farm alone. She still feels the powerful tug of memory in which she can re-create the day they met, the birth of her daugh- ter, the disappearance of a sister, and death of her grandmother. Many of the poems are inhabited by events from the past, as though they were seen in color against the bleak black and white of the present. Memory calls up the scent of blossom, the "hey diddle-dum-doh" of song, all the spoken words that make the present silence somehow bearable. As in "Ivy, Sing Ivory," Alma stays and survives: But I knew I could never go far from the sound of this creek tumbling down to the lilies of Cullo whee Valley that bloom like a garland of lace on my doorsill. The natural world is the scene for the enactment of human drama, the struggles, passions, and aspirations of those who live within it. Rooted in the land, tethered to responsibility, Alma is able to dream of freedom: "why can't I keep walking out of this / endless blue sky into somebody else's / life . . ." The images are of flight, of birds and rushing water- dream imagery taken from the life, as though the very land that constrains her is also the source of a rich imagination. Thus she can trace her unique inheritance through generations and speak with authority for her dying grandmother: But I swear by that hawk I see biding its time over Warwoman Ridge I will not iron my black dress and wear my hair tight in a bun. I will not throw the first clod of dirt in the hole. She can also project a future in which her husband returns, looking for her. By then she will have "cut free" all her memories and entered the landscape. The "you" who will know enough to sense her presence becomes the con- temporary reader- the "I" of the invocation mirrored in her basin of water. Wildwood Flower (the 1992 Lamont Poetry Selection of the Academy of American Poets) is filled with images of nature, but they are not meant to stand alone. Byer "interprets" nature by constructing in detail the individual life of a character who is part of the natural cycle. In Alma, there is none of the distance of an analyst or spectator. The poems remind us that the human is "natural."</page><page sequence="6">150 THE GEORGIA REVIEW If Kathryn Stripling Byer is trying to restore our American past, Mary Oliver has, over a period of many years, been chronicling its demise. Her New and Selected Poems reminds us of the territory she has covered since her first publications in the early 1960's, and I am glad to see some old favorites in this larger context. For example, "Ghosts" (from American Primitive , 1983) mourns the loss of the buffalo by imagining a time when they were abundant; then, with its insistent question- "have you noticed?"- the poem forces the reader to examine the silence of extinction, the blissful oblivion of those who have inherited the land. From an earlier book ( Twelve Moons , 1979), "En- tering the Kingdom" remains an excellent example of how human conscious- ness divides us from our own environment. The speaker of the poem goes out into the realm of the crows and is seen by them as "possibly dangerous." But the speaker wants only "to learn something by being nothing / a little while but the rich / lens of attention." The crows have the last word: They know me for what I am. No dreamer, No eater of leaves. Or rather, she has the last word. The speaker is forced to articulate the crows' position; observation alone does not suffice. The division between the two realms remains. In spite of the promise of the title, she has failed to enter the kingdom on its terms. The sharpened edge to Oliver's earlier work has been blunted in the in- tervening years. Her later poems began to celebrate through a kind of enrap- tured description; anything natural was a source of wonder. From there it was an easy step to grant to nature human emotions, and so it is that "Spring" can end with this image of a bear: "all day I think of her- / her white teeth, / her wordlessness, / her perfect love." Or that "Roses, Late Summer" can allow nature, instead of informing the human life, to become a substitute: "If I had another life . . . / I would be a fox, or a tree / full of waving branches. / 1 wouldn't mind being a rose / in a field full of roses." Even Oliver's questions seem to have presumptive answers: "Why should I have it [the soul], and not the camel?" Everywhere she exhibits an impulse toward fusion, toward discovering a place where the speaker can lay down her human burden and, quite literally, become one with the natural order. Interestingly, in the thirty new poems which comprise the first section of the book, this essentially Romantic impulse is at war with her earlier vision of separation. If these poems by themselves comprised a single volume, I would be forced to note its radical divisions. Even as Oliver recognizes the inability of language to bridge the gap (referring to nature's "dumb dazzle" or its lack of "expression" or its "cold and glassy eye"), she creates a space where nature's "green energy" can claim her in its "husky arms." She con- fronts the reader with a willed use of the pathetic fallacy. So it is that a deer</page><page sequence="7">JUDITH KITCHEN 15I can have "solicitude" before taking flight, that a waterfall can seem "sur- prised" by the "unexpected kindness of the air," that the gannet eating the fish is a beautiful thing because "nothing in this world moves / but as a positive power," that the owl can fill himself with a "red and digestible joy." The adjectives betray the stance: the natural is equated with the "good." The opposite is also implied: if something is not of nature, it is potentially bad. In "Goldenrod," Oliver almost confronts her own dilemma: "And what has consciousness come to anyway, so far, // that is better than these light- filled bodies?" Well, for one thing, I want to answer, the ability to speak about them, to be able to note that it is "natural and godly" to bend in the wind. Aware that the natural world is actually indifferent to her, Oliver de- liberately decides not to be indifferent to it. This gives rise to the ecstatic voice of many of the poems, and it is a voice that, because of its very excess, is most compelling. The reader is able to have reservations and still savor Oliver's ability to go with the rush of feeling. In "Peonies" she can gather the flowers with their "sweet sap" and "honeyed heaviness," exclaiming of their "dearness," and we willingly allow her this sensibility because it is so wholly hers. My favorite of such moments is at the end of "Poppies": Inside the bright fields, touched by their rough and spongy gold, I am washed and washed in the river of earthly delight- and what are you going to do- what can you do about it- deep, blue night? Frost characteristically recognizes the impenetrability of nature; Oliver de- fies it to shut her out. Oliver's opposing impulse is toward a more objective depiction of nature -what happens is simply what happens- accompanied by a self-conscious awareness of human isolation. The last stanza of "Rain" begins "Where life has no purpose, / and is neither civil nor intelligent," and this reader sighs in recognition. In "Hawk" the bird turns into a white blade- and then the blade falls. The title of "Lonely, White Fields" reveals its deliberate slippage; the owl's nightly solitude is echoed by a speaker whose singular voice says, "I don't know / what death's ultimate / purpose is . . ." And the snow simply goes on falling, "flake after perfect flake." Imagined death is at the heart of many of these new poems- and, for Oliver, death is the ultimate merger of the human and the natural. The section ends with just such an image:</page><page sequence="8">152 THE GEORGIA REVIEW One morning the fox came down the hill, glittering and confident, and didn't see me- and I thought: so this is the world. I'm not in it. It is beautiful. Oliver's failure to be adequate to her own epistemological questions makes many of these poems both interesting and irritating- how, for instance, is beauty to be perceived except through human eyes? By looking to nature as worthy of attention in its own right, Oliver acts as assessor. Her metaphors are often formulated in terms of coins , as if giving nature value in human terms. Similarly, her whole poetic endeavor to merge with nature through language reveals the contradiction (of which Oliver is painfully aware) im- plicit in the very phrase "nature writing." Mary Oliver's concept of death is finally one of union, but Dennis Hin- richsen's offers no such solace. The Rain that Falls this Far , Hinrichsen's second book, is centered on violent death, seemingly coughed up from mem- ory. In each of seven poems in the volume's first section, the narrator is haunted by scenes from his adolescence, playing over and over-like a bad movie- the moment when four companions were killed in an accident which he survived. In "Water Touching Water," the collision of the human and natural worlds is described as the car sinks in the marsh: Companions pinned like underwater blossoms. Sound of toad creep, frogs. Slur of water touching water. A hoarseness scurrying, hands and knees, across the razory grass. Hinrichsen's use of simile demonstrates how the two worlds coalesce. His companions not only become blossoms, but also "voices thrashing / in the car like birds." The car, in turn, becomes a "bruise in the bled night," or swerves "like a fish trapped in the miraculous shallows." Linguistic pairings such as the "razory grass" and the "harsh gear of an accompanying voice" make the two worlds inseparable, but in grim and frightening ways. So it is not sur- prising when the boy pushes a golf tee deep into the grave of his friend, or when a basketball shot is likened to "an afterthought to grace." In his desperate attempt to make sense of tragedy, the speaker of these poems peels the memory "to its stilled core"- a moment when water was blood, the car a cage, every- thing fluid yet forever fixed. The book's first section raises questions of fate- and faith. The opening piece, "Poem of Mercy," is a kind of prayer. "Have mercy," he repeats, on phones, on scalpels, on the "man-made" light. And on pencils, pant cuffs, and scissors. But not on himself- that is the one request he cannot seem to make. Other poems look for grace in music, in basketball, even in dreams; the nar-</page><page sequence="9">JUDITH KITCHEN I53 rator is left as the one surviving "wing" to carry these "soul-bits" into the future. The second section takes a long look at people and the blows fate has dealt them: his father's losses, his uncle's death, a quadriplegic whose house was bulldozed, the unnamed people who disappeared when the expressway bridge washed out. "Against Fate" articulates the poet's anguish: "to have no say in this except with words." Writing is the afterthought; it changes nothing. And "Testament" might as easily have been entitled "Against Faith" as Hinrichsen replays the accident, imagining the Sunday he did not attest to the power of prayer to save him. His friends, he thinks, were killed "by some irresistible viciousness, some slashing force." The poem ends with the un- answerable questions: Where could I tell them I saw God? In the marsh landscape rushing toward us? The diminishing twilight? In the quick strokes to the backs of their heads? If the experience challenges religious faith, it also raises cosmological questions. The nine poems of the third section focus first on the natural world. "The Anatomy of the Crab is Repetitive and Rhythmical " takes its title from Gregory Bateson's Mind and Nature and does some metaphysical pondering of its own: "I don't hear harmony as I stroll, / but the world's great noise is vast." Looking for patterns, Hinrichsen finds- possibly-a forethought to grace. Some hand (he is careful to tell us that it is "not God's") puts things right. He looks at the span of evolutionary time and discerns, in a Frostian moment of insight, that It is within such beauty we are poised, wholly risen out of the cell sticks, out of the musical staffs, standing by and hauling in on floating strings the kites shaped like fish, like bats. The poem ends in affirmation- with the recognition that we all wade into the sea, splashed by "the unfurling plume of wish." From this moment, in which the natural world is understood to be our world, it is a short step to "Ode," the origin of the book's title. The rain that "falls this far" is part of a continuous cycle, finding again its source deep under the earth. It is life-giving- "The panning / as if for gold / that proceeds / without us for us." The poem concludes with the realization that, although nature will go on with or without us, we are its beneficiaries. Only through this discovery can Hinrichsen grant himself some mercy and find his own brand of comfort in the paired poems "Stillborn" and</page><page sequence="10">154 THE GEORGIA REVIEW "Burying a Child." At last, death is accepted as what binds us to the natural order. The final two poems look forward. "Free Throws" returns to basket- ball as metaphor, but now he uses his ability to swish the ball to predict a future- a future which, as he discovers in "The End of Mercy," may be as much luck as it is fate. Once again, the natural world provides an imagery that allows him- and us- to understand the private human world: Or it is not like this. It is early evening, the daylight falling through the locust like a bright mist, my daughter pitching sand from her log cabin box like water from a leaky boat. It's her life now. Night and not night. I wake breathless in the middle of my life. It is no accident that Hinrichsen was reading Mind and Nature-where mind and nature coincide, he finds fodder for poetic insight, and his extraordi- nary combinations cause the reader to see each as though triangulated by what is known of the other. While Mary Oliver's fusion takes place in her mind, in an attempt to have the human vanish in the natural, Hinrichsen gives each realm its due. His favored technique of simile maintains the separateness of the man-made and the natural. The linguistic merging here is physical- the worlds collide and something new emerges. The Rain that Falls this Far is human centered, but not self-centered. Its questions are universal. As If , James Richardson's third collection (selected by Amy Clampitt for the 1 99 1 National Poetry Series), challenges the mind first and foremost. With titles such as "Anyway," "For Now," "The Mind-Body Problem," "Post-Romantic," "Askance and Strangely," and "As If Ending," many of the poems clearly engage intellectual and philosophical- and certainly se- mantic-problems. Yet nature also informs the thinking in this book: it poses some of the questions, offers up analogy, thwarts conclusions, and supplies some answers. The poems have a rich mixture of meditative flow, interior voice (rendered in italics), natural imagery, and abstract idea. Idea- and its formation- is of supreme interest to Richardson. "At First, At Last," the long central poem in twenty-four distinct parts, ponders all the ponderables: the origin of the earth, the necessity for the concept of the gods, the death of that very concept, the need for story, the recognition that science makes its own story, the need for love, the recognition that love has no science. Natural fact sets thought in motion: "Had initial conditions varied / by as little as one percent / no stars would have formed . . ." He posits a "quantum fluctuation / in the first nanosecond" in order to imagine alternative scenarios: A billion universes too hostile for us; this one is as it is-</page><page sequence="11">JUDITH KITCHEN 155 Anthropic Principle- because we survive to observe it. If the poet examines the natural world with the precision of a scientist, he may be able to invent linguistic theorems. The development of language (and the concomitant rise of story) admits to a universe of opposites. The human voice intrudes, qualifies, comments, even argues: Yet even to say I believe nothing how much you have to believe. The mind seems to cover every base from every angle, but the voice (or voices) of these poems is quietly passionate, and part of the passion is for nuance. Feeling must be fixed in words- or lost. As If (even the title seems to be ruminating) covers the nebulous territory where the mind accommodates its own confusion. Its internal weather is fog, rain, thunder rumbling in the distance. Its season is November. Everything ends and begins at once, like details rising out of mist: "for the fog avers / that to forget and begin again / is not different from going on and on." "Aver," here, differs from the anthropomorphic "surprise" of Oliver's waterfall in that the action seems to take place inside the observer as an imaginative entry into the workings of nature. This is true, also, for memory- that blur of the past- which often seems to be less recollection than passionate imagination. In fact, Richardson is more likely to imagine than recount event. "For the Children" speculates on what might have made four teenagers commit suicide with carbon monoxide, moving eventually to direct address: "Pity me that I can look on you and not die for pity, / that I am nothing you can be- lieve / when you ask why should I live? and I say having been ." "Elegy for Either of Us" is the one exception, presenting the reality of his brother's death, but in an imaginative, dreamlike manner. The ending, however, is almost fierce in its clarity: Twenty years later, you are not my brother any longer, but a child, not my death, but my daughters': I do not fear it; I hate it, not as fate any more, but injustice, the one word stuck forever in the throat. Richardson's poetry is contemplative, syntactically complex, and intel- lectually demanding in some of the ways that Charles Wright's work is de- manding, filled with surprising moments when the mind takes an unexpected turn. At times the obscurity becomes obfuscation, but, on the whole, this writing simply demands an attentive reader. Possibly because Richardson is trying to capture thought in all its fits and starts, he is a keen observer of a nature that provides him with an intricate, often ironic, mirror. The best way to demonstrate this is to quote in full "Anyway," the brilliant opening poem:</page><page sequence="12">156 THE GEORGIA REVIEW The way an acre of starlings towers and pours rapidly through itself, a slipping knot, landing so few feet down the furrows (the whole skywriting like a secret no one knows they have given away) is one of those breathtaking wastes (sun and the seeds they feed on being others) in which something senseless, even selfish, absurdly magnified, becomes grandeur (love is another). Sometimes the flock, banking in unison, vanishes an instant, like a sheet of paper edge-on (a secret, anyway, is the illusion confessing it would make a difference). I watched this happen once- two seconds, hours- till I understood no kindness, not a shadow or stone. And they did not come back, though I waited all evening (and it was you I waited for). Though the sky turned black. "Anyway" begins in observation but goes beyond it, accumulating par- enthetical clauses that indicate the presence of a particular human sensibility. When the poem shifts tense in the last five lines, the speaker reveals what he knew all along- that this act of observation was really a way of finding, in nature, a reflection of his own inner state. His final gesture is simultaneously an objective description of evening and a subjective statement of mood. Again and again, Richardson literally finds the natural world within himself, yet there is no easy reconciliation between the two orders, no solace; aware- ness of the physical world only serves to sharpen the knowledge that we are alone in our self-awareness. This same knowledge is the opening premise of Louise Gl√ºck's sixth col- lection, The Wild Iris- innovative, demanding new work by one of our most important poets. The Wild Iris returns to the distanced voice of Gl√ºck's early poetry- and to its restrained, meticulous observation of the natural world- but this volume is not recapitulation. It is a foray into new territory, from which emerges a personal mythology giving rise, in turn, to theology. The Wild Iris weaves three essential voices. The first is the singular, soli- tary cry of the supplicant. Sometimes devotional, sometimes chaste, sometimes ecstatic, this voice is found in the seven poems entitled "Matins" and the ten called "Vespers"- all of which present the human condition. These poems contain both praise and query, comprising a one-sided debate with the con- cept of god. The second voice is that of the earthly garden- of flowers both tended and wild, the anthropomorphized world speaking as from within some innate wisdom. The third voice is a dispassionate divinity as he declares him- self, either as a presence in the natural world or as an absence. Together, these fifty-four poems form a single braid; the reader senses both the individual strand and the combined strength.</page><page sequence="13">JUDITH KITCHEN 157 The poems of The Wild Iris are intellectual, wholly realized within the rational mind, and yet they depend not only on an intimate knowledge of nature but also on a respect for (and passionate love of) the natural world. In narrative time, the book's duration is from early spring through early fall - a garden's visible cycle. By giving the garden a voice, Gl√ºck forces us to see ourselves as the plants might see us-silly, foolish creatures obsessed with our mortality. Gl√ºck does not really describe the plants (description alone being of no interest to her); she speaks from inside the flowers, giving each a voice and unearthing new knowledge of human behavior by examining the par- ticularities of each variety, whether it is the lamium's predisposition toward shade ("living things don't all require / light in the same degree") or the snowdrop's surprising revival ("I didn't expect / to waken again, to feel / in damp earth my body / able to respond again ..."). The garden asks of us the most demanding questions, as in "Field Flowers": Is it enough only to look inward? Contempt for humanity is one thing, but why disdain the expansive field, your gaze rising over the clear heads of the wild buttercups into what? Your poor idea of heaven: absence of change. Better than earth? How would you know, who are neither here nor there, standing in our midst? The garden recognizes a collective experience. In contrast, the human voice here is isolated, almost monastic, tinged with loneliness. It searches for more than the immortality of words: for an order in the silence, a way to put the solitary life into a larger perspective. The morning prayers- the "Matins" poems- are optimistic in the sense that they are still asking devout questions. The "Vespers" are darker, more ready (in the absence of a spiritual sign) to discern a message in the natural world. Thus they are more likely to shock with their unexpected insight. For example, by following the implications of her own argument, Gl√ºck is able to speak of human responsibilities and to discover something of the nature of eternity: You who do not discriminate between the dead and the living, who are, in consequence, immune to foreshadowing, you may not know how much terror we bear, the spotted leaf, the red leaves of the maple falling even in August . . . Human beings bear a double burden. We can see the red leaves and know winter will follow; we are the red leaves which will drop from the branches.</page><page sequence="14">158 THE GEORGIA REVIEW And god- whoever or whatever- does not differentiate between knowing and being . The Wild Iris divides neatly into "morning" and "evening" sections, folding on the hinge of two central poems which must be seen as representing yet another (a fourth) voice- that of the poet, wholly conscious of herself in language, speaking of her ordinary life: in "Heaven and Earth" there is a fully realized present-tense moment while she watches her husband in the garden at sunset; in "The Doorway" she looks to the past, recognizing in herself the wish to recover the moment before her body flowered into the betrayal of womanhood, "the epoch of mastery // before the appearance of the gift, / before possession." Because the reader has become accustomed to the particular tones and nuances of the three predominant strains, this intru- sion comes as a surprise. On careful examination, though, each half contains one other poem ("Love in Moonlight" and "Presque Isle") also in this private, secular voice. In addition, there are occasional external interruptions that provide a balanced, healthy skepticism- and an ability to live comfortably in the world. In "Song," this received wisdom provides an ironic counter- point to the poe≈•s visionary state: "But John / objects, he thinks / if this were not a poem but / an actual garden, then / the red rose would be / re- quired to resemble / nothing else . . ." This honesty finds its more detached counterpart in the "deity" poems. Steeped in pertinent detail, and with such titles as "Clear Morning," "End of Winter," "Retreating Wind," "End of Summer," "Early Darkness," and "September Twilight," these poems fix chronological time even while moving toward abstract concepts. As they accumulate, the godhead emerges as a bit annoyed at his own creation. "You were not intended /to be unique," he announces in "Midsummer," and then refers to "your incidental souls / fixed like telescopes on some / enlargement of yourselves." Having given us life and tragedy and the means to turn it into story, he is tired of our "chaos." We are flawed "distractions." He retreats. In "September Twilight" (the final poem of this sequence), he declares his experiment complete- we have become his "vision of deepest mourning." This is a book that should be read at one sitting. The voices combine to create an intense religious experience- even if the god proves to be non- existent. The effect is one of dazzling austerity, as in the final lines of "End of Summer": If you would open your eyes you would see me, you would see the emptiness of heaven mirrored on earth, the fields vacant again, lifeless, covered with snow-</page><page sequence="15">JUDITH KITCHEN 159 then white light no longer disguised as matter. It is a privilege to watch as a poet breaks new ground. In The Wild Iris , Louise Gl√ºck has applied a stringent mind to nature in order to understand not only the self but the definition of faith and/or acceptance. (The accep- tance, though, is a dark one: we are given one brief life.) Like Frost, Gl√ºck looks for the moment she will see beyond and through . The poems are simul- taneously passionate and remote, as though written with the white heat of a distant star. Their visionary mode may even provide an entry into the snowy fields. Perhaps the greatest American nature poet wrote in prose. Norman Maclean's A River Runs Through It also ends on a spiritual, even revelatory, note: Now nearly all those I loved and did not understand when I was young are dead, but I still reach out to them. Of course, now I am too old to be much of a fisherman, and now of course I usually fish the big waters alone, although some friends think I shouldn't. Like many fly fishermen in western Montana where the summer days are almost Arctic in length, I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half- light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four- count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless rain- drops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters. As my son Matthew (who is also a fly fisherman) points out, it is only here at the end that the river, which throughout the book has functioned as a reality , finally becomes metaphoric. "All things merge into one, and a river runs through it." The "it" here is as mysterious and as enigmatic as whatever it is that belongs to Frost's woods. Something at the heart of nature is un- known and unknowable; that is the price we pay for our ability to try to put it into words.</page></plain_text>
