This is what the verb WrraEIv would in the first instance suggest to a Greek, since where weapons are concerned Homer uses it exclusively of brandishing a spear or stone. Ajax might indeed forecast for himself the 8516wEuao-ros 96vos already known to Homer (F 57) but his words by themselves could not possibly suggest it. Eustathius ad II.

Hermann gives the true explanation ' duas hastas vibrans ', but unfortunately waters it down to ' bene armatus'. Campbell, characteristically laconic, says 'with spears in both hands; 8Gio SopE 7rCa6j6xEvot') a tacit allusion to that Homeric practice in which the origin of Sophocles' phrase is undoubtedly to be sought. Two spears are a frequent though not an invariable part of the Homeric warrior's equipment, (cf. e.g., F 18, K 76, A 43, N 241) and two regularly appear on Dipylon vases in conjunction with both the round and the hour-glass shield.1 That the round shield was probably (as in Homer) slung on a telamon and certainly wielded by a central hand-grip was first established by Helbig,2 who was able to adduce abundant examples of the type from the Near East dating both to the Late Bronze and the Early Iron Age, and a scantier but not inconsiderable number from Greece, and argued convincingly that this is the round shield described or implied in a number of passages in Homer.

The phrase w6Macov 6 0s SoopE occurs several times in the Iliad.3 A right-handed man fighting at long range would of course first throw with his right hand and then transfer the second spear to it. The ambidextrous Asteropaios (0 162-3) decided to use his equivocal advantage and confuse Achilles' defence by hurling his spears simultaneously; consequently he was left without resource when he failed to pull out of the earth the famous urrrricov with which Achilles had missed him. Achilles, armed in the Bronze Age manner,4 had no second spear, but was quicker with the sword than Asteropaios. When in the 7th century the shield with a telamon and single central hand grip was superseded by the hoplite shield which had an arm-band as well as a hand-grip and no telamon, the use of two spears naturally became impossible, but the hearers or at any rate the readers of Sophocles knew their Iliad, and such of them as had met the host of Xerxes must have seen the single-grip shield handled by many of the contingents. They would not fail to interpret the poet aright. 'Brandishing a spear in either hand' is therefore the meaning of SiTrcros in this passage, natural in itself and borne out by the somewhat 1 Occasionally the number is three, e.g. on a large amphora in the British Museum.

The intensive force of "rpt- is too familiar to need illustration; but that it was ever transferred to St- there is nothing to shew. Jebb quotes no parallel, but claims that this is also the meaning of Siarrcarc in L in T., in which he differs from other scholars and is certainly wrong. He was doubly unfortunate in that he found in the words a suggestion that in the Ajax also the weapon designated was the sword; for it is hardly necessary to state that the two-handed sword was unknown in the ancient world. For Hellenic Greece, whose practice alone is relevant here, the testimony of almost innumerable vase-paintings is by itself sufficient; and it is reinforced by that of a long series of swords in corpore, beginning in the Late Bronze and covering the Early Iron Age. It is strange that the great Hellenist, who understood better than many scholars of his generation the importance of archaeology in the study of Greek life and who did much to promote the foundation of the British School of Archaeology at Athens, should have neglected archaeological evidence thus ready to his hand. On the source of the romantic error it is idle to speculate.2 Our second passage needs no long discussion. There is no ancient scholion on it, and from Barnes onwards editors have for the most part interpreted it correctly. Weil and Paley, both of them sound scholars with 1 To the classical examples of 8trwaros may be added one from Theophylactus Bulgarus (Ep. 74, Migne, Patr.

The allusion to the passage in the Ajax is clear, and so is the general sense duplice armatus. Probably Theophylactus meant 'with a weapon in each hand '. 2 Macaulay fell into it (more excusably) when, casting his ancient authorities aside and involving Horatius in a hand-to-hand encounter, he made Astur whirl up his broad- sword with both hands to the height. In his case one is inclined to suspect unconscious derivation from the famous 27th chapter of the Talisman.</page><page sequence="4">Ahrakros 175 a sensitive feeling for Greek, give renderings equivalent to ' the two swords brandished by our foes ', Weil expressly repudiating ' les 6pees ' deux tran- chants' and 'les dpdes brandies avec les deux mains'. Paley paraphrased by 80'o rraAA6pEva iyn, and farther, by a reference (without translation) to the Ajax and the Troades he shewed that he not only took the former passage in its true sense, but that he saw what other editors had failed to see, viz., that in the Troades 8ircxmarov Kiepauv6cpaES Trp must be translated on the same lines.' The phrase is commonly taken to mean 'a thunder-bolt hurled by Zeus with both hands'; but a two-handed thunder-bolt is, archaeologically speaking, as inadmissible in classical antiquity as a two- handed sword. The type of the Thunderer wielding his bolt in his raised right hand was early established and must have been familiar in every corner of the Greek world. The form of the thunder-bolt also, though admitting of much variety in its decorative detail, had long been fixed so far as the means of handling it were concerned. Generally it consisted of two sections, sometimes recognisable as bunches of flames, sometimes looking like mere stylised flowers or buds, but always placed butt to butt and united by a neat and serviceable handle, designed to admit the grasp of one hand only.2 Thus Zeus wields it. Scores of vase-paintings, not to mention other works of art, represent him engaged in the Gigantomachy or peacefully grasping the emblem of his power, and their testimony is unanimous. In view of the evidence the current translation must be abandoned and the alternative to it, ' two thunder-bolts hurled by Zeus one with each hand', examined. The attitude of Zeus which it presumes is at first sight as inadmissible as a two-handed thunder-bolt; but in fact there is warrant for it and the possibility of the proposed translation was noted long ago. C. D. Beck in his edition of Euripides 3 incorporated without comment a note on this phrase from one ' Clar. Prevost ' which runs as follows: 'On voit sur quelques medailles et pierres gravees un Jupiter foudroy- ant, tenant les mains dlevees, toutes deux armies des carreaux celestes; les Pierres grav6es du Cabinet du duc d'Orlkans en offrent un exemple '.4 It would be interesting to know what material Prevost had before him, 1 In vol. III of his Euripides, published in I86o. In his note on the passage in the Troades (vol. I, I857) he does not comment on Sfr,-rov, having probably been unable to make up his mind. For Weil's note see his Sept Tragidies d'Euripide, ad loc. 2 The few Greek thunder-bolts which consist of a single section are recorded by Jacobsthal, Der Blitz in der orientalischen und griechischen Kunst (1906), pp. 13 ff.

LORIMER for even on Oriental monuments the god of the storm seldom has a bolt in each hand. Both hands are armed, but one generally holds the lightning (or thunder-bolt variously stylised) and the other a mace, axe, spear, scimitar or curved stick, or even a sceptre. The list given by P. Jacobsthal (Der Blitz, p. 5, n. 2) of representations of the god holding two thunder-bolts includes only seven Oriental items and one Etruscan.' No actual Greek example is known; yet at some moment early in their history this form of the Thunderer captured the imagination of the Greek race. Two statues which embodied it, both at Olympia, are known to us by the record which Pausanias has left of them.2 One, a dedication of the Arcadian community of Cynaetha, was probably inspired by the other, and has therefore little importance except as witnessing to the estimation in which its model was held. That other, which stood in the Bouleuterion, was the image of Zeus Horkios before which, Tmri Kdrrpovu ropI.v, the prospective competitors together with their fathers, their brothers and their trainers swore pi86iv is -r6v 'OAupricov &amp;yt'va ae aeoat irap' amrr&amp;$v KcKovpylta.

It would be strange if the appalling form of Zeus Horkios had left no trace in literature. It must have been known by autopsy to those hundreds or rather thousands of Greeks who gathered from every quarter of the Hellenic world to attend the festival at Olympia, and by repute to thousands more. The functions of a god expressly fashioned to strike terror into the wicked would not be limited to perjurers; the Trojan women might well invoke the doubly armed deity to sink the ship which carries Helen home, content themselves to perish in the same catastrophe. Euripides could trust readers, for whom alone the subtler allusions of a chorus were intended, to take his meaning. If in this passage 8irrcA-rov means ' hurled with either hand '; it is worth while to examine another allusion to the thunder-bolt in Euripides. In the Ion the chorus, surveying the sculptures of the temple at Delphi, exclaim, 'ri ydp; KEpacvvbv lpqirvpov 63pptov v AlbS Krl6oaiotcn XEpaiv;' (212-13). The plural XEpaiv indicates that here also Zeus is SiTraTros and that the true meaning of aLpinupov is not the commonly accepted ' blazing at both ends ', (though this is the classic form of the Greek thunder-bolt), but 'blazing in either hand of Zeus '. This interpretation is supported by the use of the epithet in 716 of the same play (B&amp;KXtos aipr Trpous a VXcov rrevnas) and by Sophocles as an epithet of Artemis (Tr. 213) 'with a torch in each hand', where the meaning is indisputable. Euripides may have 1 To these may be added a cylinder seal in the British Museum (89521) and a fine stele found by Thureau-Dangin in the recent excavations at Arslan Tash, v. infr. figs. 4 and 8. 2 Paus.

III, Ioo).2 The type which imposed itself at a great centre of Hellenic life, though it proved to be ephemeral in Greek art, cannot have been a mere isolated freak, and to seek for traces of it in early literature is not unreasonable. References to it in Pindar and Euripides must be based on their knowledge of the Olympian image alone, but if earlier examples are discoverable, they may have been suggested by a new and striking form appearing on specimens of Oriental metal-work and above all of textiles which, sometimes perhaps directly, more often by way of Cyprus and Crete, were finding their way into Greek markets. One such may have inspired the passage in the Iliad (A I83-4) where Zeus seats himself on Ida, EXE 8' deo-rEpowiIV ETra XEPBiv. The line may have hovered in the consciousness of Euripides, for it is the Idaean Zeus whom the Trojan women invoke. The picture of Zeus in the Theogony is somewhat blurred and shifting. In the battle with the Titans (690-2) he seems to assume the attitude which soon became canonical in Greek art, with only the right hand armed; lightning, thunder and thunder-bolts fly XElpbOs drr6a oxapijs. Here the weapons are three; they had been conferred on him by the Cyclopes, grateful for their deliverance (504-6). Elsewhere they are only two:-ppov-ril and KEpavvos as the basis of his power (72-3), Ppovwri and crrporr'i carried for him by Pegasus (286). In his encounter with Typhon (844-56) he employs all three, thunder and lightning against Typhon's fire, the thunder-bolt against his TprprlcrrfipE &amp;VElol; the order is chiastic. It would seem that Zeus had 1 The other examples of &amp;avf'Vpos in Euripides (Hipp. 559, Hec. 473) are unrevealing, and the more obvious meaning preferable. Soph. Aj. 1405 affords the only other example of the adjective in tragedy; its meaning there is unmistakably' with fire blazing all round '. 2 Though Pindar is generally regarded as the first to include the patient in the judgment, the logical necessity of providing for his case must have been apparent from the first. The commentators go too far when they say that Pindar departed from an older tradition vouched for by a Hesiodic fragment (Rzach3 125, 3) which mentions only Asklepios. The passage is quoted by Athenagoras (rrpEaj. 29) as giving an example of an unsatis- factory character whom the pagans credited with divinity, and naturally breaks off as soon as Asklepios is disposed of.

In the classic age the thunder-bolt was the sole weapon of Zeus, but in the very earliest representations of his combats with monsters, he carries other or supplementary arms. On a number of reliefs on stamped pithoi from Rhodes and Caria which date to about the first quarter of the 7th century he appears in conflict with a monster compounded of horse and man whose identity does not concern us here; it may for convenience be called a centaur, though it is not the centaur of Greek myth. On one sherd he threatens his opponent with a double axe only; 3 on others he has in addition a sword and is perhaps thus entitled to be called i'Tra|X os (Fig. I).4 It is true that he is but imperfectly Hellenised; his weapons are those of Zeus 1 See Hesych., Suid., Et.

In place of the spear, however, Teshub normally carries the lightning or thunder-bolt, and the blade of his FIG. 2.-DETAIL OF PROTO-CORINTHIAN ARYBALLOS.

In Greece the spear was exchanged for the sceptre, symbol of a sovereignty no longer contested, and the thunder-bolt, once the Gigantomachy is safely over, becomes the instrument ofjudgment, not of battle. The sword normally carried by the Oriental deity makes, however, one unmistakable appearance in the possession of Zeus on a purely Greek monument, a proto- Corinthian aryballos (Fig. 2)5 dating to the first quarter of the 7th century and thus contemporary with the sherds of the Rhodian and Carian pithoi. Here also Zeus advances upon a horse-bodied opponent poising in one hand the thunder-bolt, which puts his identity beyond doubt; he appears to dispute with his adversary the possession of a sceptre which both clutch.

The place was fortified by Tiglath-Pileser III and the stele was found in the precincts of a temple of contemporary date.

By the end of the 8th century two motives current in Assyrian art, the winged horse and the horse-demon or centaur, had found their way to Greece.2 About 650 B.c. several Assyrian motives appear in Early Corinthian vase-painting super- 1 Thureau-Dangin, Arslan Tash, pl. II. I, p. 65. 2 The following are examples of the winged horse in Assyrian art:-Layard, Mon. of Nineveh I, pl. 44, 1 ; beardless winged figure wearing horned cap holds by their manes two winged and rearing horses; pl. 50, winged horses rearing on either side of a sacred tree. Both occur on reliefs from the N.W. palace of Assur-nasir-pal II at Nimrud and form part of the embroideries of robes, royal and divine. Textiles with woven or embroidered designs probably played a large part in bringing Oriental motives to Greece. The winged horse is a fairly common motive on seals; see, e.g., Ward, op. cit., p. 201, fig. 58o, Weber, Altorientalische Siegelbilder, pp. 24 and 93, figs. 48 and 343 (= Malten, Bellerophontes, Jb. XL (1925), p. 148, figs. 54 and 55). The centaur, winged and bending a bow, appears on seals from the Kassite period onwards; see Ward, op. cit., p. 4, fig. 21 (on which the wing is small and rudimentary) p. 209, fig. 629, p. 210, figs. 631 and 632, and cf. H. Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, p. I56. Neither motive belongs to Phoenician or Syro-Hittite art, though Malten is able to adduce a single example of a winged horse from a Hittite seal op. cit. p. I13, fig. 40; Delaporte, Catalogue des Cylindres Orientaux dans la Bibliothdque Nationale, pl. XXXVIII, nr. 65o. In Greek art a pair of winged, horse-bodied, horse-legged monsters with human head, bust and arms appears on a Late Geometric bowl AM XVIII (Attic), p. I13, fig. Io (= Perrot et Chipiez VII p. 222, fig. 96, and Kunst in Bildern, p. I12, 9). Centaurs of normal archaic form appear on a Late Geometric vase (Attic) in Copenhagen (CVA Danemark, Fasc. 2, pl. 73, 3; cf. Johansen, Vases Sicyoniens, p. 146, fig. I Io), and a winged Centaur, much like the Demons of the Attic bowl, follows a normal one on a Rhodian sherd of the 7th century; (Salzmann, Necropole de Cameiros, pl. XXXIX). The New York bronze representing a man and a centaur belongs to the Geometric Age (Richter The Sculpture and Sculptors of the Greeks, p. 337, AM I1930 Beil. 38. i). The winged horse appears on a couple of Phaleron jugs dating to c. 700; one, unpublished, is in the British Museum, the other is reproduced Jb. II (1887) p. 46, fig. 4 (= Malten, op. cit., p. 146, Fig. 47).</page><page sequence="14">AiakcA'ros 185 FIG. 8.-STELE FROM ARSLAN TASH. (From Thureau-Dangin, Arslan Tash, pl.

LORIMER seding Syro-Hittite forms characteristic of proto-Corinthian ware,' a fact which points to the intensification of Assyrian influence about that date. Among these motives the double thunder-bolt must be included The same influence manifests itself in the early metal work of Crete,2 in a period whose duration is not yet strictly defined, but whose lower limit probably falls c. 650.3 That Crete played an important r61le as intermediary between Greece and the East is certain. The type of the god with two thunder-bolts may therefore have reached Greece at any time after c. 725. It is unfortunate that, apart from the peculiarity of the two thunder- bolts, Pausanias tells us nothing of the statue of Zeus Horkios; size, material and pose are alike unknown, and we are consequently without any evidence whereby to determine its date. That unless it had P|,eo6s -rT it would hardly have impressed a traveller of the Imperial age as terror-striking is a legitimate conclusion; but if it was a columnar figure, like the undoubtedly ancient image of the Amyclaean Apollo, it might be very large and yet early. That so exotic a type would not have been admitted to the pan-Hellenic sanctuary and to so important a function in it after 6oo seems certain; probably the date might be put a good deal higher. One within the first three quarters of the 7th century may be reasonably conjectured. H. L. LORIMER. 1 This was the brilliant discovery of the late Humfry Payne, Necrocorinthia, pp. 67 ff. 2 E.
