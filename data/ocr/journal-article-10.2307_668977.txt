Reviewed by MANNING NASH, University of Chicago With his usual stylistic grace Htin Aung presents his consideration of the "folk" elements in the Theravada Buddhism of his native Burma. Folk elements are defined as those features of Burmese belief and practice still existent but antedating the imposi- tion of the little vehicle canon under Anawratha about the middle of the 11th century A.D. A chapter treats the Nine Gods and their associated planetary rites. Another, the festival of the New Year, making some interesting parallels with the Hindu Holi cere- mony and the Chinese Ching Ming through the contention that all of these ceremonies mark the vernal equinox. The cult of alchemy and the Magus receive treatment in an- other chapter. The discussion of alchemy as the search for magic powers and eternal youth makes clear the special Burmese interpretation of a proto-science once spread throughout the civilized world. The chapter on the Lord of the Mountain, now the house nat Min Maha-Giri, covers ground familiar to most students of Burmese Bud- dhist legends in a concise and clear manner. Htin Aung's view of the "37 Nats" is one he has stated before. The listing of the features of the 37 lords: sex, mode of death, rank, and time of demise is a handy device for a quick scanning of the characteristics of these anthropomorphic spirits so important in contemporary Burma. The almost exclusive attention to the cult of the "37" his- torical nats misses, of course, the hundreds of named and unnamed nats that continue</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 959 to be propitiated in Burma, and fails to find other than a taxonomic order among them. Other students of the nats (J. Nash, ms. forthcoming) have found the remarkable fact of "structured animism" to be the outstanding attribute of nat belief. That Htin Aung does not see this and other aspects stems from his interest and aim in writing this book. His chief contention is that Buddhism is the framework in which all "Non-Bud- dhist" belief and practice is interpreted by contemporary Burmese. Even the animistic, the astrological and the alchemical cults must be given a Buddhist rationale or coloring to be practiced or adhered to. While this contention is not incorrect, neither is it ade- quate. The attempt to break a living religious system into historical components may be an exercise in cultural history, only if some sophisticated notions of cultural process and systematic coherence are part of the conceptual apparatus involved. If these theo- retical frames are not used, the cataloging of trait or complex provenience verges on cultural botanizing or sheer antiquarianism. Burmese Buddhism is not now (and may never have been if I understand aright the translations of the Glass Palace Chronicles and the many divergent views of the Ari monks in the pre-Pagan dynasty), a single canonical religion. It is now a system of belief and rite spanning in a single continuum a host of diverse conceptions and practices in which the nat-astrology end is one anchor and the monk conning the Abidhamma is the other. These diverse elements, whatever their historical origin, form a single operat- ing religious system. To focus solely on the historical provenience of parts of the system is to miss a good part of the problem of the nature, meaning, and dynamics of Burmese Buddhism. Several recent students of Burmese Buddhism (E. M. Mendelson, "The King of the Weaving Mountain," Royal Central Asian Journal 48:229-37, 1961; David E. Pfanner and Jasper Ingersoll, "Theravada Buddhism and Village Economic Be- havior," Journal of Asian Studies 21:541-61, 1962; John Brohm, "Buddhism and Animism in a Burmese Village," Journal of Asian Studies, 22:155-68, 1963; Manning Nash, "Burmese Buddhism in Everyday Life," American Anthropologist, 65:285-95, 1963) have all made this point in one way or another; if one starts from the behavior and not from the books, then Burmese Buddhism appears as a single religious system with options as to belief and practice depending upon the social and cultural and per- sonality settings of the believers. It is just this problem of how Burmese Buddhism is differentially refracted through varying social, cultural, and individual prisms which is the most promising for research. Htin Aung's book provides interesting and novel historical material, some shrewd guesses as to why some things persisted to the present and why others were obliterated. But for this anthropologist, the conspicuous absence of more than a common sense framework for his wide historical knowledge limits the volume's contribution to a full- blooded temporal and functional understanding of the diverse beliefs and rituals that make up Burmese Buddhism.</page></plain_text>
