While the characters in this scene from Willard Price's book Amazon Adventure represent fictional identities, the themes of collecting and cultural hegemony, appropriation and aesthetization, and the motifs of self and other graphically expressed here resonate with an all too familiar ring in realities other than those constituted by and within the genre of the adventure novel (cf. Bahktin 1981).1 Some of these other realities constitute the ethnographic frame for this paper and the contexts in which the logic of collecting and appropriation and the construction of relations of power are explored This exploration inspired, in part, by the seminal work of Robert McKinley (1976),2 centres upon varied cultural practices of head- hunting (in this case, more correctly referred to as head-collecting) and the narrative representations of these forms of practice. The narratives of headhunting produced in each of the contexts considered in this paper variously encode, manipulate and articulate what E V. Daniel identifies as ' epistemic and ontic realities' (1990:27).3 In addition to providing people with a way of 'seeing and being in the world' (Daniel 1990:227), the narratives variously point to significant transformations in people's experiential and conceptual worlds. The primary, although by no means exclusive, ethnographic nexus for this discussion is provided by the social ' histories' 4 of the people of Amay a (Mayawo5 ) on the island of Darner, Maluku Tenggara and the works of the late-nineteenth century natural scientists Sir Alfred Rüssel Wallace and Henry O. Forbes. Both Wallace and Forbes can be placed within the earlier phase of what Stocking (1983:72) calls, the ' intermediate generation' of scientifically- trained observers of ' native life' . As such, they can be viewed as the forerunners of the ' new anthropologists' (Clifford 1988), represented by Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown. At first sight, this configuration of contexts may appear quite strange to the reader. However, apart from the more obvious temporal and spatial resonances between these contexts - both Wallace and Forbes were collecting heads in the region of Maluku Tenggara6 at a time when Mayawo themselves were actively involved in headhunting - there are, I believe, other dimensions of this conjunction which are perhaps ethnographically more compelling. The juxtaposition of such diverse contexts and texts, enables a wider reading 162 Oceania 62, 1992</page><page sequence="2">Pannell and translation of the logic(s) which informs the constructions of self and other as referential spheres of meaning. The fact that in these different cultural contexts the processes of collecting and appropriation may vary in their specificities does not, as Ernst (n.d) rightly points out, detract from such an exploration but only indicates the transformative operation of the logic(s) of otherness (cf. Lévi-Strauss 1987:113). At another level, the juxtaposition of Mayawo headhunting practices with those engaged in by Western7 scientists aims to deconstruct and de-mytholpgise constructions of the other as 'savage', 'primitive', 'exotic' and 'strange' and explore the dark fascination headhunters and headlessness have not only for ourselves but for others as well. Travelling to Other Worlds ' Headhunting' , writes McKinley, ' seems to be much concerned with how to manage the existential limits of the social world' (1976:96). The 'existential limits' McKinley refers to are represented by the existence of alien others situated in the more remote domains of one' s cosmological and, by implication, physical landscape. The distance between headhunters and their enemies is not, however, solely indicated by distinctions of space but is also marked by temporal (cf. Fabian 1983), social and cultural differences. Often the other who inhabits this space is regarded not only as radically different but is considered to be less than human.8 The definition of the other as cannibals, headhunters, or baby-killers serves, as Arens (1979:145) points out, to draw a line 'between the civilized and savage modes of existence' ; between our world and their world In light of these comments, headhunting expeditions, therefore, can be viewed as '... journeys to and from other worlds ...' (McKinley 1976:98-9). As the following accounts indicate, these journeys to other worlds articulate a number of ontic and epistemic conceptualisations. A Mayawo Journey Mayawo narratives about the headhunting activities of their fathers, grandfathers and more distant ancestors are spatially and temporally configured in terms of a journey between distant and different worlds. The socially acknowledged orator in Amaya commenced 'his story' about the origins and focus of Mayawo headhunting practices with such a journey. A woman called Artoro married a man from Umpenawany. They went to the island of Terbang Utara to look for food. A strong wind, however, blew their canoe off course and carried them to the village of Arwala Ilwai on the island of Wetar [the village of Arwala Ilwai is situated on the eastern tip of Wetar some 200 kilometres southeast of Amaya].9 This part of the narrative clearly establishes not only the spatial framework which is integral to the topography of the overall narrative but also reveals the existence of other worlds within Mayawo cosmological thought, albeit on the periphery of this universe. In this connection, it is of interest to note that on the Mayawo cosmological map the island of Wetar is situated far beyond the domain of the dead, who are believed to travel by canoe to the coral atolls of Nus Leur. Wetar is also cosmologically located beyond the land of sorcerers, anthropomorphic beings which inhabit the island of Maopora. The next part of the narrative is perhaps the most significant, for it marks the social and cultural distance and differences between the world of the Mayawo and that of the people of Arwala Ilwai. When the people of Arwala Ilwai saw the man and the woman from Amaya they rushed out and killed them. They cut the woman' s stomach open and took out the 163</page><page sequence="3">Travelling to Other Worlds When the people of Arwala Ilwai saw the man and the woman from Amaya they rushed out and killed them. They cut the woman' s stomach open and took out the child she was carrying. They hung the foetus on a pole. Then they carried the pole to Amaya and paraded the body of the child before the villagers. This action infuriated the people of Amaya and they vowed that as long as there existed people from Amaya and people from Arwala Ilwai then there would always be war between the two villages. Only when one or the other of the groups were totally destroyed would the war end Notwithstanding the cultural significance accorded their actions by the Wetarese, for the people of Amaya the act of foeticide depicted in the narrative clearly serves to establish the otherness of the inhabitants of Arwala Hwai. Confronted by the existence of different beliefs and practices the Mayawo response is to eradicate those who, by their very existence, threaten the integrity of Mayawo social and cultural reproduction. For foeticide (and infanticide) represents just that, a denial of cultural and temporal continuity. However, killing the enemy in not sufficient in and of itself to resolve the conflict posed by the existence of radical others. As McKinley points out, 'it is impossible to kill a phenomenological threat' (1976:116). They are, however, alternate ways of resolving the problem of otherness, as the following lines of the narrative reveal. The elders of Amaya decreed that each generation of Mayawo men travel to Wetar, fight with the inhabitants and return home with the trophies of their victory - the severed heads of their enemy. Thus, while the construction of the people of Arwala Ilwai as other initially informs and facilitates the waging of war against them by Mayawo residents, it is the collecting of Arwala heads by Mayawo warriors which attempts to resolve this ' phenomenological' dilemma. The cutting, collecting, and appropriation of the heads of one's enemies, however, suggests that heads are more than just graphic trophies of war. The Wanderings of Naturalists In the opening pages to his famous work 77ie Malay Archipelago, the naturalist Sir Alfred Rüssel Wallace writes that 'to the ordinary Englishman this [the Malay Archipelago] is perhaps the least known part of the globe' (1872:1). An integral dimension of what constitutes the unknownness of this 'part of the globe' is its spatial and temporal distance from the shores of Europe. As Wallace states, the traveller 'finds that voyages ... are commonly reckoned by weeks and months' (1872:2) rather than by hours and days. The unknown is not only prefigured in terms of time and space (cf. Fabian 1983:16) but also in social, cultural and phenomenal terms. To this end Wallace concludes that, ...he [the traveller] soon comes to look upon this region as one apart from the rest of the world, with its own races of men and its own aspects of nature; with its own ideas, feelings, customs and modes of speech ... (loc. cit.). In his own words he had 'reached a new world, inhabited by strange people' (1872:417). The primary object of Wallace's 'wanderings' (1872:594) in the Malay Archipelago was 'to obtain specimens of natural history, both for my private collection and to supply duplicates to museums and amateurs' (ibid.:xi). In the course of his eight years away from England, Wallace amassed a staggering collection of 125,660 specimens. Notwithstanding this interest in 'natural history', a significant proportion of Wallace's work in the Malay archipelago was devoted to recording what he refers to as the 'ethnological peculiarities of 164</page><page sequence="4">Pannell the human inhabitants' (1872:ix). In this connection, his objective was to identify 'the races of man ... their chief physical and mental characteristics, their affinities with each other... their migrations and their probable origins' (1872:582). To this end, Wallace documented the physical characteristics of the 'natives' and the various features of their 'savage life'. The form of collecting and headhunting Wallace engaged in was of a more subtle nature than the kind Henry O. Forbes, a fellow naturalist, took part in. Wandering in Wallace' s footsteps, some sixteen years after his return to England, Henry O. Forbes was, to cite the Earl of Cranbrook's words, 'a highland Scot ... imbued with the unsettling urge to quit his native soil and travel the world around' (1989:v). And travel the world around he did, spending long periods of time in the eastern reaches of the Netherlands East Indies. For Forbes, stepping off the mail boat in Batavia meant saying 'goodbye to Western life and ways' (ibid:5) and entering into the 'strange' and the 'confused' world of the 'East'. He had journeyed to another world While Forbes, like Wallace, amassed an enormous collection of plant and animal species during his wanderings, it is clear from his writings that he, perhaps more than Wallace, was also greatly interested in 'the diversity of humankind' (1989:v) he encountered in his travels. These ethnological interests came to dominate the later years of his career when he variously occupied the positions of Director of the Canterbury Museum in New Zealand and the Liverpool Museum in England, and was employed as a Lecturer in Ethnology at Edinburgh University. In addition to collecting plant and animal specimens - his descriptions (and those of Wallace) of his methods of collecting the latter constitute a bloody and graphic contribution to the 'pornography of violence' (McKinley 1976:118) - Forbes also collected 'human anatomical specimens' (Forbes 1989:vii). As a member of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, it appears Forbes acted quite in accordance with the directives set out in the Institute' s methodological handbook, in which it is stated that although ' it is often difficult to collect recent human skulls and bones, ... every effort should be made to do so' (cited in Price 1990:133). For the most part, Forbes' literal collection of the other consisted of human skulls. Ms methods of acquiring such 'specimens' are discussed in greater detail in the following sections. The headhunting journeys undertaken by the Mayawo and the British naturalists represent voyages to other worlds. For the people of Amaya, the island of Wetar is situated on the outer limits of their cosmological and social horizons. The existence of others, whose actions suggest a radical otherness while simultaneously indicating a common humanity, threatens the viability of Mayawo cosmological constructions. For Wallace and Forbes, on the other hand, the islands of the Malay archipelago represent the furthest reaches of their imaginative landscape, populated as they are with 'headhunters', 'cannibals' and 'animists' - the vivid images of the exotic, the bizarre and the primitive. Their knowledge of the existence of other worlds is inextricably linked to the articulation of, what Kuklick calls, an 'imperialist enthusiasm' (Kuklick 1983:78), which Britain and a number of other European powers actively expressed The exploration and colonization of previously uncharted, ' dark' continental expanses (e.g. Africa, South America, Asia) and the concomitant production of knowledge relating to these areas by travellers, naturalists, missionaries and colonial administrators, revealed the existence of radical others who, by their very discovery, posed a challenge to the absolute epistemic and ontic validity of late-nineteenth century metropolitan cosmologies. As the following section suggests, the strategies instigated by Wallace, Forbes and others of their ilk, and those implemented by the Mayawo to resolve this 165</page><page sequence="5">Travelling to Other Worlds phenomenological problem are, in terms of their logic, similar, insofar as both pivot upon the practices of appropriation and incorporation. The Practices of Headhunting: A Social and Cultural Exploration Mayawo experiences of headhunting are as recent as those of deceased kinsmen in the parental and grand-parental generations. The practice of headhunting was prohibited by the Dutch in the early years of this century, although the feud between the residents of Amaya and Arwala Ilawi was not resolved until 1951, when Indonesian regional government officials intervened The following account of Mayawo headhunting (hteti ulkona, literally 'they cut heads') practices is based upon the recollections and reconstructions of a number of elderly Mayawo men, primarily speaking about the exploits of their grandfathers and other men of that generation.10 According to local accounts, a week prior to their departure the Mayawo warriors abstained from sexual relations and performed a number of rituals which were intended to harness the power and strength of the village ancestors (upho mamso). To test the strength the ancestors had bestowed upon them for the express purposes of headhunting, the Mayawo men first travelled to the island of Kisar. Here they engaged in mock combat with the residents of Abusul. If, in the course of these fights, a Mayawo warrior was bloodied, then he was required to return to Amaya. Only when the men from Amaya sustained wounds that did not bleed could they proceed to the island of Wetar. Upon reaching the village of Arwala Ilwai, the men from Amaya did not immediately disembark but stayed on their boat for three days and nights. During this time, they made offerings to their ancestors and called upon them to give the men the courage and the strength to win the forthcoming engagement with the inhabitants from Wetar. On the third day, the ancestors descended and the Mayawo men became possessed of their powers. They then went ashore and fought for three days and nights with the male residents of Arwala Ilwai. Not one man from Amaya was injured or killed during this encounter.11 On the fourth day, after the fighting had ceased, the ryesro or head of the 'house' (Urna) Helweldery went among the bodies of those of the enemy who were either dead or severely injured and marked the neck of each man with a small cut. Other members of the Mayawo party came and decapitated those marked with this sign. According to local accounts, in the final encounter between Amaya and Wetar, the Mayawo warriors returned home with 30 heads. Upon their return to Amaya, the warriors were stopped at the entrance to the walled village. A ritual specialist from the 'house' of Soplero ('of the sun') asked the assembled men where they had come from and what they carried with them? The warriors replied that they had journeyed from Wetar and carried with them 'rotten fish', referring to the severed heads of their enemies. The heads were then given to the ritual authority, who placed them upon a sacrificial stone slab (norto) as offerings to the village ancestors. The warriors then deposited their weapons and called upon their ancestors to take back the powers they had previously bestowed As part of the sacrificial process, the whole head was smoked until the flesh and the hair were consumed and only the skull remained The skulls were then removed and taken to a prominent point, some distance from the village, named Tutikpauni ('big cape'). Tutikpauni is better known, however, as Deulkonadinjeri, the 'place of the human heads'. The heads were then placed upon and around a stone cairn. Twelve of the 13 stone cairns at Deulkonadinjeri are said to represent the 12 generations of Mayawo warriors who fought and took Wetarese heads. The thirteenth cairn is said to have held the skulls of murdered Dutch 166</page><page sequence="6">Pannell men, and from local accounts, it appears that lone Dutch men who trespassed upon Mayawo territory were quickly dispatched Tutikpauni was chosen as the most appropriate site because of its orientation towards the island of Wetar. Directly facing Wetar, it was believed that the display of skulls on raised stone platforms would not only graphically indicate the prowess of the Mayawo men as warriors but would also serve as a powerful visual deterrent to others. The Collections of Wallace and Forbes While Wallace and Forbes did not actually kill and decapitate human beings, they did collect, in a variety of ways, the heads of local people. In addition, both scientists engaged in a carnage of the indigenous fauna which extended the length and breadth of the Malay Archipelago. Their appetite for collecting the specimens and accoutrements of otherness, in all their exotic, primitive and strange finery, was insatiable; these actions also served, paradoxically, to construct them as radical others in the eyes of local people. From his book, it is apparent that Wallace, unlike Henry Forbes, did not collect or purchase human crania during his wanderings, although it is clear that he did take measurements of people's heads. In the following passages, taken from sections variously entitled'The Natives', 'Savage Life', and'The Inhabitants', Wallace describes the anatomical and ' moral' features of the different peoples he encounters. These snippets indicate the kind of headhunting in which Wallace engaged Writing of the inhabitants of the Kei Islands, Wallace observes that, ...the Malay face is of the Mongolian type, broad and somewhat flat. The brows are depressed, the mouth wide ... and the nose small and well formed.. The face is smooth ... the hair black, coarse and perfectly straight. The Papuan, on the other hand, has a face which we may say is compressing and projecting. The brows are protuberant and overhanging, die mouth large and prominent, while the nose is very large... The twisted beard and frizzly hair complete this remarkable contrast (1872:416-17). Of the inhabitants of Seram, he writes, The people seem decidedly more Papuan... They are darker in colour and a number of them have the frizzly Papuan hair; their features are also harsh and prominent, and the women in particular are far less engaging than those of the Malay race (1872:352). These concluding sentiments are repeated again in Wallace' s (1872:464) comments on the women of the Aru Islands. 'The women', he states, ' ... are by no means so pleasant to look at as the men. Their toilet is very simple, but also, I am sorry to say, very coarse and disgusting.' This form of 'headhunting' was obviously quite popular and accepted among the scientific and anthropological establishment of the time. For example, an article of the same era, published in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (1893:138), describes the dominant anatomical features of the 'natives' of Darner as belonging to one of two racial types; ' ... the low nose, straightish hair, thick lips, roundheads and high cheekbones, with general dullness of expression, point to Malayan origin' . Whereas, '... the strong frizzly mop of hair, handsome face, aquiline and slightly hooked nose and general brightness of disposition' were widely regarded as the defining features of those of Papuan origins. 167</page><page sequence="7">Travelling to Other Worlds Moreover, these descriptions do not just refer to the physical characteristics of each so-called 'race', but also allude to a number of subjective judgements about the moral and mental disposition of the other. In this connection, Wallace (1872:588) writes that * the Malay is bashful, cold, undemonstrative and quiet; the Papuan is bold, impetuous, excitable and noisy' . Wallace concludes that ' the intellect of the Malay race seems very deficient' and rates the intellect of the Papuans as much higher (1872:585, 587). One way of quantifying and ascertaining the 'mental activity' and 'capacity for civilization' (Wallace 1872:602) of each group was by means of cranioscopy, or what we might these days refer to as anthropometry, phrenology or physical anthropology. In an appendix to his work, Wallace proceeds to compare and hence classify the different 'races' of the east according to the cranial measurements of 362 Malay, Papuan, Polynesian, Australian and 'Negroe' crania. From this 'Thesaurus Cranium', Wallace (1872:602) concludes that the differing cranial measurements 'furnish tolerably reliable race-characters' and accord 'very well with what we know of their ['the natives'] mental activity and their capacity for civilization' . While in the Am Islands, Wallace' s collecting methods and his reasons for engaging in such activities were questioned by the local people. As Wallace (1872:460) states, I ... tried to explain to them that they [his specimens] would be stuffed, and made to look as if alive, and people in my country would go to look at them. But this was not satisfying; ... they could not believe I would take so much trouble with their birds and beasts just for people to look at. They had evidently been thinking about it, and had at length what seemed a very satisfactory theory ... 'What becomes of them when you go on to the sea?' ... 'What did you think became of them?' 'They come to life again, don't they?' As a result of this exchange, Wallace writes that the local people now regard him as a 'conjurer'. Indeed, even his 'writing materials and books are to them weird things' (1872:470). He begins to believe that for the next generation of Arnese, he shall be transformed into a 'magician or demigod, a worker of miracles, and a being of supernatural knowledge' (1872:470). Wherever he travelled in the East Indies, Wallace encountered similar responses to his collecting behaviour. In this regard, the indiscriminate killing of animals not for their flesh, which was discarded, but for their skins, feathers and bones and the careful preservation of such items, certainly served to define Wallace as a radically different and distant other. For Wallace, the indifference of the local people to the specimens and objects he collected served to mark the boundary between his world and theirs. In a passage, quoted at length because it so succinctly captures the ethos of Western collecting practices, Wallace (1872:444) remarks that, I knew how few Europeans had ever beheld the perfect little organism I now gazed upon... The emotions excited in the minds of the naturalist, who has long desired to see the actual thing which he has hitherto known only by description, drawing or badly preserved external covering ... require the poetic faculty to fully express them. The remote island in which I found myself situated, in an almost unvisited sea, far from the tracks of merchant fleets and navies; the wild luxuriant tropical forest ... the rude uncultured savages who gathered around me, - all had their influence in determining the emotions with which I gazed upon this thing of beauty. Here we have it all; the desire to not only accumulate objects but also to possess them; the notion that collecting is based upon a culture of 'connoisseurship' (Price 1989:7); the 168</page><page sequence="8">Pannell taxonomy of self and other which pivots upon arbitrary and abstracted ideas of an objective aesthetic; the belief that the collector ' discovers, acquires and salvages objects' from a world that is given and not produced (Clifford 1988:220); the primitivization of time and space; and the implementation of a system of values which entails expropriation and incorporation and embodies hierarchies of power and politics. As Wallace's words indicate and as James Clifford (1988:218) points out, the act of collecting represents * an excessive, sometimes even rapacious need to have [which] is transformed into rule-governed, meaningful desire' . Although it is also clear from his descriptions that Heniy Forbes engaged in the same kind of head collecting and dissecting as Wallace, he largely directed his energies towards the actual collection of the other. This, as the following passages demonstrate, took the form of collecting human skulls and other parts of the human anatomy. Forbes (1989:310-11) writes of the inhabitants of the Tanimbar Islands, for instance, that the colour of their smooth soft skin is a rich chocolate brown; ... the forehead retreats slightly [and] ... the brows are low but not conspicuously hairy. The eyes are small and narrow ... the upper lip is prognathus [while] the teeth of the upper jaw overlap those of the lower jaw... The description continues in this vein, discussing the anatomical features of the Tanimabarese head as if it was already a severed and preserved scientific specimen, disconnected from its corporeal, personal, social and cultural contexts. The decapitation and expropriation of the other in this sense is given further expression in Forbes' attempts at acquiring the other. The symbolic violence of this process is recognised by those who are constructed as the source of Forbes' collecting desires. ' It seems' , writes Forbes (1989:309), 'as if there existed in these countries a superstitious dread of any part of their person being in possession of another. One day, when I purchased from a man his father' s skull, something of the same dread appeared' . On another occasion involving negotiations for the purchase of a skull, Forbes (1989:329) remarks that, [The] son, who before giving me possession, inserted a pece of pinang nut between its [his father's skull] teeth ... and paid his last invocation to the Head of his line. That son's welfare is regulated now from the Mammalian Gallery of the British Museum! The passages quoted here are exemplary rather than exceptional, and epitomize the means by which Forbes acquired his collection of 11 skulls from the Tanimbar Islands. Some of the skulls ended up in museums, while others went to private collections, but all were incorporated into the production of texts and discourse about the other. This point leads me to the central problematic of this section, which revolves around the question of how headhunting resolves the contradiction posed by the existence of the other. Before I proceed with this discussion, however, I will briefly detour and examine why heads, more than any other bodily part, are collected When I asked people in Amaya this question, their initial response was that it was 'customary'. It was also the case, they remarked, that heads, as opposed to a whole bocfy, were quite portable and that bodies, unlike heads, did not clearly encode the identity or otherness of the enemy. Herein lies the key to understanding the * symbolic valence of heads' (McKinley 1976:118) for the Mayawo. Heads are important because they are the locus of that corporeal and social configuration - the face. The face, according to McKinley 169</page><page sequence="9">Travelling to Other Worlds (1976:118), not only expresses personal identity at the 'social level' but also articulates social identity at the 'individual level' . Taking a head, therefore, also means taking a face and, as such, Mayawo headhunting is concerned with the appropriation of this physical symbol of social personhood TTie face appears to be of little significance in understanding the logic of Western headhunting. Even when describing the heads of the Tanimbarese or the Arnese, or any other group for that matter, Wallace and Forbes pay no attention to the face as a total configuration of referents. The face is not described; what is described are the anatomical features of the face in isolation and without connection to the whole. Wallace and Forbes' observations of the other represent, therefore, a form of 'discursive dissection'. The clue to understanding headhunting in this context is provided by their collection and measurement of human crania. For it is clear that in this case it is the head itself which is regarded as the ultimate physical symbol of identity. In Western thought, the head is conceptualised as the repository of intelligence, knowledge, perception and consciousness. It is the site of the rational and the unemotional, the mind and human thought; the original locus of 'mental structures' (Lévi-Strauss 1964:10) and hence cultural patterns.12 In light of this, the head represents the most logical index in which racial, cultural and mental characteristics could be quantified, compared and ranked This point leads me back to a consideration of how the collecting of heads attempts to resolve the problems represented by otherness. In the ethnographic contexts considered here, this resolution is achieved by the processes of appropriation. The appropriation of the other, in both these instances, necessarily entails the incorporation of the other. In the case of the British naturalists, this incorporation takes place on a number of different levels. The displacement of individuals, societies, social practices and human skulls from their historical and cultural contexts, and their respective public placement within scientific texts and museum collections represents just one aspect of the process of incorporation. This removal and recontextualisation constitutes a radical alteration of the original time/space dimensions of the other and the objects of otherness. Relocated within the chronotopic (cf. Bakhtin 1990) contexts of texts and museums, the other is inextricably entangled with the past (that is, our conceptualisations of the past). Yet, the dislocation of the other from historical time in these contexts, also serves to structure the other as timeless (cf. Fabian 1983; Stocking 1985; Bennett 1988). By collecting, measuring and comparing the heads (and social life) of the other, Wallace and Forbes attempted to 'reconstruct the history of human racial differentiation and interconnection' (Chapman 1985:39), and to (somehow) create a taxonomic hierarchy of 'Man's' development and civilization. In their endeavours towards this end, Wallace and Forbes were not alone and their work along these lines clearly reflects, what Stocking (1985:8) refers to as the 'conservative evolutionary gradualism' which pervaded scientific and anthropological discourse in the late nineteenth century (cf. Fabian 1983; Peacock 1986). Working from the principle theoretical position of evolutionism that ' all races had a common biological origin' (Torgovnick 1990:186) and that, by extension, they also occupied or participated in the same linear time frame, Wallace and Forbes re-affirmed the widely held belief that so-called ' primitive' societies represented various stages on the lower rungs of the scale of human development, while late- Victorian British society constituted the most advanced form on this continuum. Studying these societies, therefore, enables the West to discover something about its own origins; to look into its past while still remaining in the present. In order for this temporal sleight of hand to work whereby the other encodes both a 170</page><page sequence="10">Paniteli timeless past and a timeless present, the primitive, as Marianna Torgovnick (1990: 186) points out, 'must represent a common past - our past, a Euro- American past so long gone that we can find no traces of it in Western spaces' . This expropriation of the other from a specific spatial, temporal and cultural context and incorporation within the taxonomic and temporal orders of the West, epitomized by the chronotope of the museum, thus engendered a redefinition of the ' symbolic valence' of the other in terms of the ascribed scientific, aesthetic and technological cultural values and visions of the West. As Bennett (1988:93) states, * the exhibition of other peoples served as a vehicle for the edification of a national public and the confirmation of its imperial superiority' . The incorporation of the other into this arbitrary system of values andmeanings is always at a point removed from equivalence with the collector, the curator, the observer. The incorporation of the other, therefore, is, as both Clifford (1988) and Stocking (1985) suggest, hierarchical, exclusive and strategic, predicated as it is upon relations of power and knowledge and the articulation of wealth. In the case of Wallace and Forbes, their field endeavours directed towards the collection of the other was financially supported and locally empowered by the colonial regimes of Britain and the Netherlands and various institutions of influence such as the British Museum, The Royal Geographical Society and The Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland Without these connections, it is doubtful whether Wallace or Forbes would have been able to conduct their research in the Indonesian archipelago, as they did, with minimal resistance from local people. In the case of the Mayawo, the processes of appropriation and incorporation take on different forms. The severed heads of their enemies are not, contrary to McKinley' s hypothesis, treated as 'friends' or 'guests' but are metaphorically referred to in terms of gustatory images ('rotten fish'). The incorporation of the other, in this sense, is effected through the transformative act of cooking. If, as Lévi-Strauss (1987) suggests, cooked food is symbolic of 'culture' then the metaphorical construction of the enemy's heads as 'rotten' symbolically classifies the other as lacking culture. However, by referring to the severed heads as 'fish' , a primary staple in Amaya, Mayawo also recognise the resonances between their own humanity and that of the other. In light of Lévi-Strauss' (1964:336) culinary code, it is interesting to note that among the people of Amaya, uncooked fruit and vegetables are not considered to constitute 'proper' food and are regarded as suitable for consumption by small children and domestic animals only. Rotten food, on the other hand, is not considered suitable for consumption by domestic animals. In Amaya, the consumption of cooked food not only represents an index of socialization but it is also the idiom of sociality; whereby social and cultural identity is created and affirmed through and by the staging of elaborate, collective feasts. Mayawo resolve the otherness that the captured heads represent by offering them as food to the ancestors of their respective 'houses'.13 The heads are slowly cooked until the flesh, the hair, and most importantly, the face is consumed in the process (cf. Valeri 1985:56). The ancestors are thus believed to consume and incorporate both the corporeality and identity of the other. The transformation is complete. The other, as an 'external social person', is converted into an 'internal social person' (McKinley 1976:120). The consumption of the other in this way has, however, wider implications. In Mayawo thought, ancestral beings are regarded as consubstantial with living individuals so that the constitution of a particular 'house' (Urna) is reckoned in terms of all past and present members. Consequently, the consumption of the other is not symbolically confined to just the village ancestors but is an act which, by extension, involves all Mayawo individuals. The bare skull, removed from the 171</page><page sequence="11">Travelling to Other Worlds village and displayed upon stone platforms, in this context, does not encapsulate the identity of the other in the same way that the face does but functions as a tangible trophy of the act of appropriation. Incorporation of the other is also predicated upon the articulation of power and is hierarchical, exclusive and strategic in form and content. Empowered by their ancestors, Mayawo travel to other worlds and collect the tangible symbols of otherness - heads. They proceed to incorporate the heads into an hierarchical order circumscribed by the constellation of relations created between people and ancestral beings. This incorporation also involves the recontextualisation of the other within the cosmologically inscribed landscape of the Mayawo territorial domain. Similar, in some respects, to what happens within the context of a museum, this re-placement signals a dramatic change to the spatial and temporal dimensions of the other, resulting in a redefinition of its symbolic and social meaning. THE TECTONICS OF SHIFTING WORLDS AND CHANGING TIMES: COLONIALISM AND MUSEUMS Fancy the honour, the kudos, the f mm! A whole museum attirili with one's name! Fancy the thousands all crowding to see Skull of the Last Aborigine! Presented by Asterisk Dash, [Ph.D].! J.B. Stephen (cited in Robert Drewe's book Vie Savage Crows) 'My mother' s father , whose head we preserve in remembrance*. Label accompanying a decorated human skull in the Pacific Collection of the South Australian Museum. It would be all too easy to dismiss the exploits of Wallace and Forbes as residues of a time long past or Mayawo headhunting narratives as remnants of a distant and forgotten world However, as the following accounts demonstrate, both have an index, in some cases, transformative, in realities constructed in the present tense. At one particular point in the course of my stay in Amaya, I noticed that people were starting to act quite 'strangely'. Instead of leaving the doors and windows of their houses unlocked at night, as was usually the case, I noticed that eveiyone had started to do just the opposite. Instead of travelling the long distance to their gardens in the southern reaches of the island by themselves, most people elected to visit their gardens close to the village or travel south in a convoy of canoes. When I asked why people were acting in such a way I was told that there were 'headhunters in the area' . Upon clarification, I discovered that the ' headhunters' referred to here were no less than two Dutch engineers, who were visiting each of the large islands in the region to ascertain the viability of constructing a quay. For a period of about a month, the time that it took the two engineers to conduct and complete their investigations, the people in Amaya lived in mortal fear that one or more of them would be abducted by the Dutch men, their heads severed from their bodies and used to strengthen the foundations of the proposed quays. This belief that the Dutch did and still do hunt heads for this purpose is quite widespread throughout Maluku. Bartels (1977:291), for example, reports that on Ambon it is 'believed that the Dutch secured heads to be buried under the foundations of large buildings, light towers, or bridges in order to guarantee their permanence' . The actions imputed to the Dutch 172</page><page sequence="12">Pannell here are not unlike former indigenous practices in Maluku centred around the construction of a house. Ellen (1986:10), for instance, reports that among the Nuaulu of Seram the erection of a house 'formerly required the taking of a head' which was buried beneath the main post in the northeast corner of the building. Roxana Waterson (1991:123) further documents similar practices elsewhere in the Indonesian archipelago. Rather than dismissing these beliefs as constituting bizarre, amusing or ignorant stories (see Arens 1979:13), it is perhaps more revealing to consider them as political narratives which symbolically point to transformations in people's experiential world In Maluku Tenggara, it was the Dutch who eventually brought about pacification and the cessation of headhunting. For Europeans, the region, as Lebar (1972: 110) points out, was * long noted for the fierce qualities of its native inhabitants, with frequent reports of hostility to outsiders and a propensity for headhunting and ... cannibalism'. For people in Amaya, headhunting not only represented the means by which the existence of others could be culturally resolved but it also represented a context in which Mayawo could express their identity vis a vis others by harnessing the power of their ancestors. Indeed, the ability to take heads was regarded as a potent sign of one' s power. Pacification of the region radically redefined relations of power obtaining between the different villages and groups in the region as well as between local people and the Dutch colonisers. Up until this point in time, Mayawo and others had expressed their autonomy and control with respect to the Dutch by killing and decapitating them. With pacification, Mayawo were prevented from expressing and asserting their power in this way. The ascription of the practice of headhunting to the Dutch, therefore, represents a recognition of the shift in the locus of power which pacification affected The Dutch, in this context, are cast as the consumers of Mayawo vitality and, as such, are empowered to hunt heads in the way that the Mayawo once did The cultural fragmentation and alienation that Mayawo experienced as a result of Dutch colonialism is graphically reflected in these local beliefs14 (see Pannell 1990). As a chilc£ I can recall the many weekend afternoons spent wandering around the foreign world of the South Australian Museum. Two displays, in particular, the 'Egyptian Room' and the 'Pacific Collection', captured my imagination and filled me with curiosity, wonderment and, at times, horror. Two of the most lasting memories I have of those days are of the mummified remains of an Egyptian prince' s severed feet and of decorated human skulls, with eyes made from cowrie shells. I went back to the Museum the other day, some twenty or so years later, to check the veracity of these childhood images. On the surface, nothing had really changed The feet and the heads were still there. As I strolled around the Pacific Collection, I was haunted by the temporal and logical continuities between what I observed and the observations of Wallace and Forbes some one hundred years previously. The same taxonomic classification of races and cultures and stockpiling of the objects of otherness were evident as I gazed at the 29 human heads on display, not to mention the numerous disembodied and decapitated masks that also abound in the collection. The resonances between these heads and our notions of the 'savage', the 'primitive' and the 'exotic' are clearly expressed in the configuration of the various displays in which the heads feature. In most cases, the skulls are presented against a highly pre-emptory background of bows, arrows, shields, spears, clubs and stone-axes - the implements of war-fare - which visually suggests to the public a cultural context of violence and barbarism. These icons of savagery are meticulously arranged in fan-shaped configurations or aligned in linear fashion according to size. This spatial arrangement not only points to the classification of these items in terms of their 173</page><page sequence="13">Travelling to Other Worlds perceived functional correspondence but also visually articulates the dominant taxonomic and metaphoric frames of evolutionism, the branching tree or the sequential line. In some cases, the skulls are juxtaposed with photographs of various ' native' individuals, giving observers the impression that they are looking at the actual person whose skull is exhibited In one display case, entitled 'New Britain', three elongated and distorted skulls are presented immediately below three separate photographs of 'New Britain' men with the same cranial features as the skulls. What, indeed, is the visitor to make of this? While the skulls remain on display, there is evidence of tectonic changes in the relations between such institutions and the people who, in the past, were physically incorporated into the museum context or from whom many of the objects displayed and contained within the museum were expropriated These relational shifts, in some cases inversions, pivot around concerns of representation, ownership and relevance. The museum, as Stocking points out, is 'no longer exclusively a Euro- American preserve' (1985:11), as witness the establishment throughout the world of museums by indigenous people. Even within Western museums, the question is increasingly asked as to who has the authority to control the display and representation of meaning in this context. As a consequence, many museum curators have been forced to rethink the logic of representation, the placement and ordering of objects and the chronotopic dimensions of this domain. Perhaps even more far-reaching, in terms of its implications for the veiy existence of museums, has been the issue of the repatriation of cultural items. As Clifford (1988:247) observes, 'the "proper" place of many objects in museums is now subject to contest'. Already in Australia we have seen the repatriation of Aboriginal skeletal remains from museums and universities in Europe and the return of Aboriginal secret/sacred objects, skeletal parts, genealogical material, photographs, and other cultural property housed in national museums to various Aboriginal individuals and communities. However, as recent media-covered debates involving members of the anthropological community demonstrate, this repatriation of cultural objects and human skeletal remains has not been without contestation and controversy. The emergence of these issues about the ownership, representation and location of cultural objects and human skeletal remains, which I have only briefly touched upon here, points to a transformation in the traditional relationship obtaining between Western institutions (such as museums), objects and the other. As Clifford (1988:247) observes, a new kind of appropriation is taking place, one which involves the re-collection (sic) and re-incorporation of non- Western objects into cultural contexts other than those represented by the art/culture collections of Western museums. However, while Clifford and Stocking suggest that the repatriation of cultural items threatens the veiy existence of museums, their analysis fails to take into account the micro-strategies of power and the framework of knowledge articulated in these contexts. As a number of recent cases of Aboriginal object repatriation involving Australian museums demonstrates, the locus of power and knowledge (cf. Foucault 1981; Bennett 1988) is still firmly situated within the museum or with the European gatekeepers of these institutions. Apart from the more obvious control of knowledge of the specificities of the collection, there are often, as Norman Palmer (1989:201-4) points out, legal or policy dictates which not only restrict the kind of objects returned but also restrain the alienation or disposal of museum property generally. In this connection, it is also important to recognise that the administration and activities of many museums are inextricably linked to the political aspirations and bureaucratic apparatus of the State. The repatriation of cultural items is thus a highly political act which not only involves the museum but is also structured, at the very least, by the agendas and actions of various 174</page><page sequence="14">Pannell State departments, indigenous communities and individuals and their representative organizations. THE SAVAGE; THE EXOTIC AND THE PRIMITIVE: THE IMAGINATIVE BSfDEX OF THE OTHER Headltunting seemed utterly alien and morally reprehensible. Renato Rosaldo, Culture and Truth. While the two primary narrative strands presented in this paper can be read independently of each other, the exegetical force of each account is better appreciated when they are juxtaposed Through this juxtaposition, it is possible to re-think and radically re-define our conceptualisation of the act of appropriation, the relationships engendered by this act, and the objects and subjects involved in this act. As I have demonstrated in this paper, acts of appropriation are not confined to or configured as the exclusive province of dominant Euro- American cultures. The forms and foci of appropriation are both multiple and multiplex. Appropriating the other or the representations of the other is an act of 'epistemic and ontic' (Daniel 1990:227) significance directed, as it is, towards the resolution of noumenal and phenomenological contradictions. This resolution is also an expression of power. The act of appropriation, whereby something or someone becomes one's own, pivots upon the re-evaluation and re-structuring of persons, relationships and objects into an hierarchical system, which variously excludes, controls and prioritises self and other according to the social, moral and ethical meanings imputed by the dominant culture (cf. Fabian 1983; Stocking 1985; Clifford 1988; Price 1989). Although this paper lends support to the idea that the identification of western notions of the exotic, the savage and the primitive with the practice of headhunting finds its most articulate form within the disciplines of anthropology and museology , it is important to realise that the imaginative index of such fantasies is not solely confined to these contexts. Within our own culture, cinema, literature, the print media, television, nursery rhymes, historical and folkloric narratives together represent only a few of the many registers for the generation and expression of such imagery. Some of these images and notions are also today held by people in Amaya. The civilizing discourses generated by the Protestant Church in Maluku and the development-orientated and modernity-centred propaganda of the Indonesian Nation-State contribute to the recasting of previous Mayawo practices of headhunting as 'primitive' and 'barbaric' . Interestingly, the exploits of our • ancestors' (Wallace and Forbes in this instance) are also looked upon by many as ' barbaric' and ' strange' . We do not, therefore, have to travel to distant countries or visit different cultures in order to locate the other. As the two ethnographic examples considered in this paper suggest, we only have to look into our past to discover the other dimension of ourselves. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research on which parts of this paper are based was supported by a Research Scholarship from the University of Adelaide and was conducted in Indonesia during the period 1986-1987 under the auspices of Lenibaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia and Universitas Hasanuddin. In the course of writing this paper, I benefited from discussions with my friends and colleagues David Wood and lindy Warrell. 175</page><page sequence="15">Travelling to Other Worlds NOTES 1. Interestingly, Willard Price's autobiography, which purports to tell the *true story of his own life of adventure' (1982:frontispiece), still fits neatly into this genre. I would also include the books by Wyn Sargent, a 'photo-journalist* with a Quaker background, entitled People of the Valley: Life with a Cannibal Tribe in New Guinea (1974a) and My Life with Headhunted (1974b). 2. In addition to McKinley' s article, Tom Ernst's unpublished seminar paper on 'Cannibalism, Headhunting and Museums' has proven a valuable source of inspiration for some of the arguments presented in this paper. Fora critique of McKinley's perspective and, by extension Ernst's arguments, see Freeman (1979:233-246). 3. Following E.V.Daniel's (1990) discussion, the terms 'ontic' and 'epistemic' are employed here to respectively signify a distinction between discourses which are 'embodied' and those which are 'theoretical' in their orientations. This is not to say, however, that ontic and epidemic narratives exist as disparate provinces of meaning or that there are not instances of transformation whereby epidemic discourses become embodied in practice and vice versa. 4. Mayawo regard their accounts of the origins and practice of headhunting as historical fact. In the vernacular they refer to these narratives as hnyero, a term which is used interchangeably with the Indonesian word sejarah and, like its Indonesian synonym, hnyero is locally translated to mean history. 5. For clarity and ease of reference, I underline Mayawo terms and italicize Indonesian and Ambonese-Malay words. 6. Maluku Tenggara is an Indonesian government administrative region which incorporates the islands of Am, Kei, Tanimbar, Wetar, Kisar, Babar and Darner as well as a number of other, smaller islands in the general vicinity. According to Lebar (1972:1 10), the term 'southeastern islands' refers specifically to the islands of Kei, Am and Tanimbar whereas Wetar, Kisar, Leti, Damer, Romang, Babar, Nila, Teun and Sema together make up the 'southwestern islands'. However, I should point out that this particular classification of islands in the southern Moluccas is by no means accorded consistency or consensus in the literature and reflects the specificities of both history and geography. 7. Although far from satisfactory, for the purposes of this discussion I employ the term 'the west*, following Marianna Torgovnick (1990:256 n.41), to referto 'dominant Euro-American cultures'. 8. In this connection, it is interesting to note that many people in Amaya consider the inhabitants of Irian Jaya to be less than human. Stories they have heard about women suckling piglets on their breasts serve to support and validate this view. 9. In his monograph on Wetar, the Dutch anthropologist J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong (1947:16) mentions that the village of Erai on the island occasionally experienced ' raids from Damer . This village could possibly be the same one referred to in Mayawo narratives as Ilwai. 10. In this connection, I am particularly indebted to Pak St. Surlia and his nephew Urbanus Surlia for their investment of time, effort and interest in this writing project. 1 1. According to narratives recorded by J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong on Wetar (1947:59-60), the raiders from Damar sustained heavy losses. 12. Consider, for example, contemporary cultural reasons why an individual is declared dead when no brain activity can be evinced, even though the heart and lungs are still capable of functioning; or the logic whereby individuals (e.g. Walt Disney), upon death, have just their head cryogenized; or even the genre of sci-fi films which feature a pulsating brain or a disembodied head capable of rational thought and articulate speech. 13. The concept of feeding the ancestors appears to be quite widespread throughout Indonesia. In this connection, Waterson (1991:217) documents practical instances of this notion in Sumatra and Sulawesi. Forbes (1989:318) also remarks upon the Tanim barese practice of 'feeding the ancestors'. 14. More recently (1989), the logic which informs these beliefs concerning the Dutch has been extended to incorporate the Butonese fishermen who regularly visit the island to poach Trochus shells and other marine products. Mayawo believe that, when presented with the opportunity, the Butonese kidnap local residents, 176</page><page sequence="16">Pannell dismember them and use the various body parts as shark bait. Again, these beliefs reflect the loss of control and power people in Amaya experience in the face of Butonese activities. These activities threaten both the economic livelihood of village residents and the integrity of Mayawo territorial rights. REFERENCES ARENS, W. 1979.
