<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EVOLUTION OF PRIMATE SOCIAL STRUCTURES* JUNICHIRO ITANI Kyoto University A brief history is given of primatology injapan and several attempts to generalise about primate social organisations are reviewed. The author's own approach is then presented, according to which it is necessary to view social structures diachronically in order to form hypotheses about the evolution of primate social organisation. There are two types of primate society: those with and those without a 'basic social unit' (BSU). The latter, 'elemental societies', are common among nocturnal prosimians and are thought to be the most primitive type of primate social organisation. The BSU is a bisexual group which has mechanisms to regulate its size and composition, etc. By the presence/absence of emigration and immigration in both sexes, six types of BSU are distinguishable, all of which are observed in nature. Primate speciae may be classified by type of BSU and the evolutionary pathways of social structure are phylogenetically traced in each family or subfamily. Patrilineal or matrilineal BSU's are thought to be the most elaborate. Finally, the social behaviour which enables the BSU to be formed and maintained in each specia is discussed. The study of primates in their natural habitats began with the pioneering work of Professor C. R. Carpenter, passed through a period of no research before and after the second world war and, after I960, became very active again with the goal of elucidating 'Man's place in nature' (Huxley I 863). When Professor S. L. Washburn was honoured with the I966 Huxley Memorial Medal, long-term research on primates had only recently been placed on a firm footing, but today, seventeen years later, a vast quantity of information has been accumulated. The ecology and social organisation of primates is extremely variable, and for many species the structures found were quite unexpected. We have information of this kind for only about half of the I 70 or so species of living primates, and for only about half of these again (about 40 species) do we have satisfactory long-term data. The remaining gaps in our knowledge will be gradually filled, but even as field research continues, based on the valuable information available to us, it is our duty to gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of the Order Primates. This objective has been pursued in many fields of biology, and with respect to social organisation. We must, however, deepen our thinking based on material acquired recently. This lecture is one such attempt. I will first present a summary ofJapanese primatology, which may not be familiar to many of you, and then review some of the generalisations attempted by researchers concerning the social structures of primates. With that as a background, I shall then present some of my own ideas. *The Huxley Memorial Lecture for I984 Man (N.S.) 20, 593-6II</page><page sequence="2">594 JUNICHIRO ITANI Primatology inJapan Primatology got under way inJapan in I948, during the poverty and exhaustion of the post-war period. This was ten years before the revival of primatology in Europe and the United States. There are three reasons for this. First, to our great fortune, theJapanese macaque (Macacafuscata) is indigenous to our country. The monkeys have been close neighbours to theJapanese people from ancient times, but although there are many folk tales and songs about monkeys, there were no scientific reports on their ecology or behaviour. Second, despite the poverty of the post-war period, research could be carried out as long as one had a pair of binoculars, a notebook and a pencil. Third, we were foruntate to have a great leader and theoretician in the person of Professor Kinji Imanishi. Professor Imanishi had already led several research expeditions by that time. Later he made great contributions to primatology and anthropology, and also set forth his own unique theory of evolution. In I947 he began a study of semi-wild horses in southeastern Kyushu (one of Japan's four main islands) and I joined him the following year. We discovered that wild monkeys also lived in our field site. Needless to say, the monkeys soon became our subject of study. In pursuit of these monkeys, we visited their habitats throughout Japan, starting with Koshima and Takasakiyama. Observing wild monkeys is quite difficult and on many occasions we spent a whole day without seeing a single monkey. In the summer of I952, however, at Koshima, we succeeded for the first time in provisioning a troop of monkeys. Thus we were able to observe, on the seashore, a complete portrait of the monkey troop which could not be seen in the forest. We set out to identify each animal, giving each individual a name, and began to analyse their society. The individual identification method had already been used by Imanishi in his analysis of wild horse society. We did not, however, understand the true value of individual identification until much later. Individual identification allowed us to find each individual's position within a lineage. It became the foundation of long-term observation, and was the key to unravelling the mechanism by which social groups were perpetuated. The Koshima troop was a small one with only twenty members, but observations from that summer through to the following winter quickly yielded an important discovery. This was that the Japanese macaque possesses a clear mating season, and the characteristic social structure of the troop is main- tained through both the mating and non-mating seasons (Itani &amp; Tokuda I958; Imanishi I960). This was mentioned by Washburn in his Memorial Lecture (Washburn I968), and was the basis of the criticism of the 'sex causes society' theory (Zuckerman I932). It was, furthermore, the main point of Imanishi's English paper introducingJapanese research (Imanishi I960). In the autumn of I952 the Takasakiyama troop was also provisioned, and in the following spring I became the research supervisor for that troop. By I954 I had identified and named approximately 200 monkeys of the troop. Thus, seven years after the beginning of the research, we were able to describe the outline of Japanese macaque society, and this led to my first book, The monkeys of Takasakiyama, published in I954. My colleagues and I worked closely together studying many fascinating phenomena, such as vocal communication (Itani I963), dominance-rank (Kawai</page><page sequence="3">JUNICHIRO ITANI 595 1958), sexual relations (Itani &amp; Tokuda 9 58), and paternal care (Itani ig59), but it was our work on culture which first captured international attention. In fact in I952, the same year as the provisioning of the Koshima troop, Imanishi had proposed the existence of infrahuman culture in an essay entitled 'Evolution of humanities' (I952). He stated, 'To consider human behaviour as entirely cultural or animal behaviour as entirely instinctual are both merely dogma' (I952: sb). Needless to say we worked hard to demonstrate the existence of culture. Kawamura identified many examples of variation in food habits and behaviour patterns among troops (Kawamura I954; i956; I959; i965). We believed that the unique behaviours found in each troop were cultural be- haviours. Kawamura was also the first to record the sweet potato washing behaviour and the process of its propagation in the Koshima monkeys, which was later to become world famous. I pursued for two years the propagation of candy eating behaviour among the Takasakiyama troop which began after visitors attempted to give candies to the monkeys (Itani i958). Kawai studied the propagation and transmission of potato washing and wheat washing behaviour in the Koshima troop (Kawai i965). By the mid-ig6o's our research on culture reached a tentative conclusion, but this issue was not debated in the international academic community until the I970's. I must add a comment here concerning the problem of culture. Most of the cultural behaviour we observed was related to the life activities of the monkeys such as knowledge of foods, or how to process foods. But Imanishi was concerned not only with such individual centred behaviour, but also group centred behaviour, such as leadership, and attempted to explain its transmission with the concept of'identification' (Imanishi I957; I970). I believe that research on infrahuman culture will once again be revived and lead to many new insights into the behaviour of primates (Itani &amp; Nishimura I973). After a decade of research, primatology inJapan was well established. One of the most important events in that first decade was the establishment oftheJapan Monkey Centre in i956, which provided the primatologists ofJapan with their first institutional base. As the first staff members of the Centre, Kawai and I were busy with the construction of the centre, and the publication of the first issues ofthejournal Primates. In i958 the Centre was able to send its first research team, consisting of Imanishi and myself, to Africa. Since then, from gorillas to chimpanzees and then to pygmy chimpanzees, gelada baboons, and mandrills, research in Africa has continued. In order to reconstruct the course of human evolution we study not only non-human primates, but also the hunter-gatherer, pastoral, and even agricultural peoples. Furthermore, research was begun in south-east Asia, India, and south America, and carried on by a new generation of fieldworkers. The details of this history must be omitted, but I should like to point out one characteristic of Japan's primatology. Our research has focused upon social structure and its evolution, rather than on understanding the mechanisms by which individual behaviour is determined.</page><page sequence="4">596 JUNICHIRO ITANI Somegeneralisations concerning the social structure ofprimates Several attempts have been made to discover generalisations, or a unifying understanding, concerning the evolution of primate societies. C. R. Carpenter, with his vast experience gained during many excellent field studies, attempted a few generalisations on the grouping behaviour of non-human primates. In the introduction to a paper entitled 'Tentative generalizations on grouping be- haviour of non-human primates' (I954) he stated, 'The following are assump- tions which for us are untenable'. One such assumption was, 'that the phenomena known as "mind", language, society, culture, and "value" exist exclusively on the level of human evolution'. He further stated that this assumption had led to today's homocentric delusions. Considering the sub- sequent history of the development of primatology his prediction seems to have been correct. Carpenter compared primate grouping behaviour with thirteen factors, including individual interactions within groups, group composition, sex ratio, group integration and autonomy. He seemed to have been most interested in the synchronic structures of groups or found in groups, and although he mentioned the semi-closed or outbreeding nature of social groups, he still stated, 'Kinship relations are not operative and inbreeding is the rule rather than the exception to the normative behaviour of non-human primates' (I954: 27b). Research on primate social structures later progressed rapidly with the analysis of kinship relations, but that was late in his life. Three years prior to Carpenter's paper, in i95 I, Imanishi had written a book entitled Infrahuman societies. Since it was written one year before the first Japanese monkey troop was provisioned, the book featured Carpenter's work with howler monkeys, spider monkeys and gibbons. This book also, in many ways, set forth guidelines for the primate studies that had just begun in Japan. He had published in the year before (Imanishi I950) the third report on the semi-wild horses and the subtitle to that was 'A proposal for Specia, Specion, and Oikia, Oikion'. The specia was a sociological entity corresponding to the biological species, and referred to the 'society of the species' or 'species synusia'. Although the term specia does not appear often in Infrahuman societies, Imanishi asserted that the only scientific method which will permit the eluci- dation of the origin of human society was a comparative sociological one based on the elucidation of each specia. His fundamental attitude is sociological. When thinking about social groups, for example, he excluded such ideas as population ecology and productivity. He handled problems of the biological or physio- logical dimension as psychological and, by using intermediary psychological mechanisms, raised his discussion to a sociological level. Here I am reminded of Imanishi's first book, The world of living organisms, published in I94I, in which he wrote as follows. We are attempting to understand the life of living things and observe the world in which they live from the human standpoint. Thus the only form of expression permitted to us is to translate this life and world into human terms. A biology deprived of analogy can only go the way of a wretched mechanism. The rationalization of analogy may be the life spirit of a new biology (I94I: I8).</page><page sequence="5">JUNICHIRO ITANI Japanese culture does not emphasise the' difference between people and animals, and so it is relatively free from the spell of anti-anthropomorphism. The conviction that anthropomorphism is not to be discarded in elucidating the complex specia of primates was widely held by Japanese primatologists from very early in our history (Asquith I984), and we feel that this has led to many important discoveries, such as that of culture, paternal care and the incest avoidance mechanism. To avoid misunderstanding, I must point out that analogy is, of course, only a way of groping towards theoretical possibilities, from which hypotheses are formulated and then tested rigorously through field research. This is one reason we so strongly emphasise long-term field research. In i958, Imanishi and I, on our return from Africa, travelled through Europe and the United States, and visited many Western primatologists. We felt the exciting atmosphere at the dawn of the revival of post-war primatology. Plans were being made for research on hamadryas baboons, gelada baboons, savanna baboons and gorillas. A symposium held at Burg Wartenstein in Ig59 on the Social life of early man may indeed mark the revival. A volume with the same title, edited by Washburn, was published in I96I, the first chapter of which was a paper by Bourliere entitled 'Patterns of social grouping among wild primates'. He presented the information then available organised according to taxonomic families, and further stated, 'In the face of the number and importance of the gaps in our knowledge, it would be completely useless to attempt a synthesis of the whole' (I96I: I). In his concluding remarks he made two important points. First, he pointed out that uniform social structures could not be discerned at the family or the subfamily level, and furthermore, the same structures were found in distant taxonomic groups. Second, he stated that great variations existed in the size and composition of social groups within species, and he suggested that the search for the mechanisms regulating the variation was perhaps the most interesting topic. This is a most important assertion in the light of subsequent research. In i965, what may be called the second milestone, a book edited by I. DeVore entitled Primate behavior, was published. Unfortunately, Japanese researchers, despite their seventeen-year research history at the time, were not among the authors. In the final chapter of the book, Washburn and Hamburg repeated that the 'sex causes society' theory cannot be supported, but they did not attempt to present a systematic explanation of primate social structures. Since there is little time I will touch upon only a few important early trends. First, J. Crook andJ. S. Gartlan, in their 'On the evolution of primate societies' (I966) suggested that primate species living in the same environments had the same social structures. They categorised all primate societies according to five habitat grades, from forest to grassland, and proposed nine social factors which corresponded to each habitat grade, including diet, daily activity and group size. They further proposed that social evolution had started with the nocturnal, forest living, solitary species of grade I, proceeded through grades 2, 3, and 4, and towards the one-male groups living in grasslands. They further proposed that the Dryopithecine and early hominid radiations were analogous to the transition of cercopithecid monkeys from grade four to five. This theory was heavily tinged with environmental determinism, and the basis of its argument</page><page sequence="6">598 JUNICHIRO ITANI was undermined with the discovery of forest living guenon monkeys with one-male troops (Struhsaker I969). H. Kummer attempted many creative ethological analyses of the hamadryas baboon (Kummer I967; I968), but showed his adherence to environmental determinism in his book Primate societies by stating, 'It is as yet unknown what ecological factors may be responsible for the one-male groups of the forest species' (I97I: 68). Another study which simultaneously considered social and ecological factors was 'The relation between ecology and social structure in primates' by J. F. Eisenberg et al. (I972). They proposed five types of social structures: solitary living, parental family, one-male troop, age-graded-male troop and multi-male troop. The parental family was postulated to be the original type, the other three types evolved with the increasing tolerance of males towards other males, and the multi-male troop was thus the most evolved type. The age-graded-male troop was proposed as a transitional type between one-male and multi-male troops, because the term multi-male had previously been applied to terrestrial species, and a term was required for arboreal or semi-terrestrial species, in which the group composition was multi-male but only one male actually participated in reproduction. They further classified each social type according to food habits and whether they were terrestrial or arboreal, and categorised the living primate species. The result, according to their table, placed the savanna monkeys, Japanese macaques and chimpanzees within the same category. In the same year as this paper, I published my own book, The social structure of primates (I 972) . Twelve years have passed and I do not believe all my ideas of that time are still valid, and in some cases I have changed my mind. But my basic methodology has not changed. I still believe that any discussion of the evolution of primate social structure must be based on the comparison of the diachronic structures of specia. I must, however, reconsider three major points in my book. First, in several places I rely on biological implications to explain some transitions of one social structure to another, and Imanishi (1976) has criticised me on this point. Second, I did not consider the transitional process by which social structures evolved, and although information on this point was not readily available at the time, more material is available today. Third, I reduced all primate societies to two types of unit groups, the pair and matrilineal type unit groups and, based on this thinking, postulated two opposing social systems-the matrilineal and non-matrilineal-and proposed that one crystal- lisation of the non-matrilineal type was the patrilineal societies of the genus Pan (Itani 1977; I980). Many more types of social structures, however, exist within the order Primates. Six basic social unit types in non-human primates The goal of my research is to understand the evolution of the social structure of primates and, ultimately, to solve the mystery of the emergence of human society. Since I have approached this problem with the analysis and comparison of the social structures of each species, which Imanishi calls specia, what I have been engaged in should perhaps be called comparative primate sociology.</page><page sequence="7">JUNICHIRO ITANI Our pursuit of individually identified monkeys has continued now for thirty-six years. During this time many generations of monkeys have passed, and the baton has passed to a new generation of fieldworkers. Research is continuing and many new facts are still being discovered. Does this mean we are studying the history of primate societies? I believe that we can close in on the true nature of social structures only by pursuing the life history of individual primates, and the history of social groups. Unfortunately I only have the time today to present to you a few of my own views. The basic social unit (BSU) of each primate specia has its own unique structure. They can be classified into a few types, but all basic social units conform to the following characteristics or principles: i. A BSU is composed of both sexes, and its characteristic structure is main- tained through both the sexual and non-sexual periods. 2. A BSU is a semi-closed system towards lone individuals and other BSUs. All members of a specia are born within a BSU, but not all continue to live within a BSU. But individuals outside a BSU always retain the possibility of becoming a member of a BSU. 3. A BSU has temporal continuity, and possesses mechanisms which regulate its size and composition. 4. Each specia has only one type of BSU. When multiple levels exist, only one level is the BSU, and the higher or lower units are more recently developed structures. I should like to add a few observations on BSUs. Primate speciae are often composed of, first, BSUs with territorial identities which are dispersed and maintain a social distance from one another, and, second, lone individuals or unstable mono-sexual associations which wander within the interstices of BSUs. One further point I should like to add is that the structural continuity of BSUs is profoundly related to the incest avoidance mechanism. BSUs exist within the specia of about 40 per cent of the prosimians and all simians except orangutans. The characteristics listed above are essential when attempting to categorise the BSUs found among primates. Based on whether males or females migrate from or into BSUs, a table with four quadrants can be formed (table i). Since each quadrant includes the two possibilities of males or females emigrating or immigrating, the combination of these four quadrants can produce I6 combi- nations. Each combination is a potential BSU. But ten types contradict one or other of the four principles of a BSU listed previously. The abcd type with no emigration or immigration contradicts principle number (2) which is that a BSU is semi-closed. Abcd and aBcd also contradict principle (2). In the end only six types are theoretically possible. If the lineality of BSUs are considered im- portant, the six types can be named as follows: ABCD is bilateral, AbCd is matrilineal, aBcD is patrilineal (fig. i), ABcd is monogamous, ABcD is polygynous and ABCd is polyandrous (fig. 2). Field research has shown that all six types occur in nature. I should like to explain briefly each type and list the species which possess each type of BSU.</page><page sequence="8">6oo JUNICHIRO ITANI ABCD Bilateral AbCd aBcD Matrilineal Patrilineal FIGURE i.

Four quadrants based on whether males or females migrate from or migrate into BSUs. Male Female Yes (A) Yes (B) Emigration No (a) No (b) Yes (C) Yes (D) Immigration No (c) No (d) First, in the monogamous BSU (ABcd) all offspring of both sexes depart from the natal group upon reaching sexual maturity. And since entry into a BSU is not permitted, the pair composition is maintained. Since both the male and female individuals that have departed from a BSU cannot enter another, they must form a new BSU with another individual of the opposite sex that has also departed from its BSU. This BSU does not have trans-generational continuity. This BSU structure may be the most primitive within primate social evolution. Clear examples are: the avahi (Avahi laniger) and indri (Indri indri) of the</page><page sequence="9">JUNICHIRO ITANI 6o1 Indriidae, the spectral tarsier (Tarsius spectium) of the Tarsiidae, the night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus), titi monkey (Callicebus spp.) and saki (Pithecia spp.) of the Cebidae, the Mentawai langur (Presbytis potenziani) of the Colobinae (Watanabe I98I), and gibbons (Hylobates spp.) of the Hylobatinae. Other possible examples are gentle lemur (Hapalemur griseus) and mongoose lemur (Lemus mongoz) of the Lemuridae, and DeBrazza's monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus) of this Cercopithecinae (Gautier-Hion &amp; Gautier I978). It is notable that the monogamous BSU is found in six out of nine families of nonhuman primates, and in all families with BSUs except Callithrichidae (Sussman &amp; Kinzey I984). The bilateral BSU (ABCD) allows both sexes to emigrate and immigrate. Not very much is known about this type. The composition is multi-male/ multi-female, the sizes are about ten to twenty animals, and the sex ratio is probably not constant, considering its structure. Glander (I984) has pursued a troop of mantled-howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) for twelve years and there seems little doubt that the group structure of this species is maintained bilater- ally. On Barro Colorado Island this species has been studied since I 93 i and is the oldest subject of study. Their groups were believed to have been maintained only by male transfer, but its diachronic structure revealed a most unexpected reality. The red howler (Alouatta seniculus) has small groups with only 3-I4 members (Neville I972; Izawa I976) and Gaulin &amp; Gaulin (I982) have reported that this species also has a bilateral structure. The cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) of the Callitrichidae, with groups averaging six members, also falls within this BSU type (Neyman 1977). But its reproductive pattern appears polyandrous and more research is required on this species. Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) of the Indriidae may also be of this type but it is possible that the BSU may not be a unit of reproduction (Richard I976). There are two reports from east and west Africa that the specia of the red colobus (Colobus badius) of the Colobinae has this type of BSU (Marsh I979; Starin I98I). The polyandrous BSU (ABCd) has become better known in recent years. Garber and his colleagues have discovered that the moustached tamarin (Saguinus mystax) of the Callitrichidae has a group structure which is indis- tinguishable from bilateral on first sight, but since only one female participates in reproduction the group structure is functionally polyandrous (Garber et al. 1984). In other words the BSU is composed of one reproductive female and her offspring, a few males that possibly participate in reproduction, and a few females that do not reproduce. Therefore, if we determine the BSU type by the presence/absence of emigration and immigration in both sexes, so far no polyandrous BSU in its strict sense has been known. The type reported by Garber and others may be regarded as a variant of bilateral BSU. Here, however, I should like to refer to it by 'polyandry'. Garber and others have stated that several species of callitrichids have this group structure. Group sizes are from 2-I2 animals, and include pair-like BSUs, but the pair may grow into multi-male/single-female or multi-male/multi-female groups. The lineality and structural maintenance of this BSU is not known. The polygynous BSU (ABcD), in contrast to the polyandrous BSU, does not permit the entry of males. Therefore the composition is one-male/multi-female,</page><page sequence="10">602 JUNICHIRO ITANI and the male which has departed from his natal group forms a new BSU. Only the gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) has this type of BSU. A few examples of gorilla groups which do not conform to this structure have been observed (Schaller I963), but according to reliable long term research (Harcourt et al. 1976; Fossey I983), only one male in a group behaves like the patriarch, and the other males are his sons. Although it is possible for a son to inherit his father's group, most males depart from the natal group, and the gorilla group's fundamental struc- ture continues only during the lifetime of the patriarch-like male and has no trans-generational continuity. The gorilla's one-male/multi-female compo- sition has some superficial similarities with the matrilineal type BSU I shall consider next, but their mechanisms of perpetuation are completely different. Although gorilla BSUs have been observed to have both one-male/multi- female, and multi-male/multi-female compositions, this may be the result of the ageing of groups (Itani 1972; I980). In the matrilineal BSU (AbCd) only the males migrate and in principle the females remain within their natal group. Thus the BSU preserves the matri- lineally linked females. In this BSU group fission is known as one mechanism for regulating group size, and it takes the form of the parting of ways by estranged lineage groups (Koyama 1970). Group size varies greatly within and between speciae but groups of only about ten members are sometimes main- tained and examples of groups with several hundred members are known. The multi-male and one-male subtypes exist, but their fundamental structures are identical. It is the most common BSU within the Cercopithecidae; all species possess this BSU type. In addition within the Lemuridae the ringtail lemur (Lemur catta) and brown lemur (L.fulvus) fall within this category. The patrilineal BSU (aBcD) has q structure that is the mirror image of the matrilineal BSU. Only females migrate between groups (Nishida &amp; Kawanaka 1972; Kano I982) and the BSU is thus perpetuated by the preservation of patrilineally linked males (Itani I 980). Only the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and pygmy chimpanzee (P. paniscus) possess this type of BSU. The mechanisms for maintaining trans-generational continuity are the same in both specia, although in the BSU of chimpanzees a central male coalition has been discovered (Nishida 1979), and in the pygmy chimpanzee subgroups based on kin-related males maintaining close mother-son relationships have been recognized (Kuroda 1979; Kano I980). Group fission is known for this BSU type as well (Goodall et al. I979). Furthermore, the extinction of BSUs as a result of the death of the central males has also been observed (Goodall I983; Nishida et al. I985). The six basic types of BSUs have been presented above, but a few compli- cations must be mentioned. These are the gelada baboon (Theropithecus gelada) and hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) with multilayered structures. The gelada baboon's BSU is a matrilineal one-male/multi-female group, but 2-3 groups together form a 'team', and about three teams together form a 'band', with a more or less stable membership, and furthermore several bands associate freely to form a 'herd' (Kawai et al. I983). These four levels have been recognised, but the upper three layers may have resulted from the elaboration of neighbourhood relations. The hamadryas baboon, according to Kummer (I968) has three layers: the one-male unit, band and troop. The band is believed</page><page sequence="11">JUNICHIRO ITANI 603 to correspond to the troop of the savanna baboons, but recently another unitjust above the one-male unit called a 'clan' has been recognised (Sigg et al. I982). Several one-male units are strongly linked based on an 'age-graded hierarchy of obviously related males', and a stable membership is maintained for up to six years. The females move between the one-male groups, within a clan as well as between clans, but the males do not leave the clan. This structure may have come about by ending the male migration seen in the matrilineal BSUs of the savanna baboons, and forming a male kin-related section (clan), with the males coexisting by forming their own one-male units. The neckbiting behaviour unique to this species and the herding behaviour that is even more severe than that of the gelada baboon, all imply that the one-male groups are a secondarily developed lower level unit. It must also be pointed out that the band is approaching a closed system, and the secondarily developed clan functions like a patrilineal BSU. Much more long-term analytical research is required on the interaction between bands in the future. A summary of the primate speciae which possess BSUs has been presented. Although it is possible that other fundamental structures will be discovered in the future, we have recognised most of the important ones. Besides these types there are the most primitive elemental societies without BSUs in the nocturnal prosimians, but I should now like to treat them as one type of society and consider the evolutionary process of primate societies. The evolution of societies The structural variation in the specia of each family or subfamily must be understood as the historical products of the evolution of the specia. First, it appears that the forces of Yin ( It ) and Yang ( J ), which the ancient Chinese used to explain nature, have affected the evolution of primate social structures as well. The literal meaning of Yin is 'shade' and Yang 'sunlight'. The dichotomy between nocturnal and diurnal is far more fundamental than forest and open land, arboreal and terrestrial, humid and dry. Primates passed from the world of Shade to the world of Sunlight in the course of their evolution, and their societies must also have followed the same path. The societies of nocturnal primates are composed of either solitary dwellers or monogamous BSUs. The solitary societies are found within the Lorisidae, Daubentoniidae, and the Cheirogaleinae within the Lemuridae. The only other nocturnal species are the weasel lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus) of the Lemurinae, the avahi (Avahi laniger) of the Indriidae, three species of the Tarsiidae, and the night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus) of the Cebidae. Among these the weasel lemur (Hladik et al. I980) and the Bornean tarsier (Tarsius bancanus) (Fogden 1976) are solitary dwellers. The avahi (Petter I962, I965), spectral tarsier (T. spectrum) (MacKinnon &amp; MacKinnon I980) and night monkey (Wright 1978; I98I) all have monogamous societies. The important point is that BSUs were born in the shadow phase and all were monogamous. The historical origin of the primate BSU must be the monogamous BSU. The transitional process from nocturnal to diurnal is expressed by the genus</page><page sequence="12">604 JUNICHIRO ITANI Lemur, but the crepuscular life-style found among primates may be a sub-type of diurnal life. There is one species, however, the mongoose lemur (Lemur mongoz) which was discovered to be nocturnal in lowland forests and diurnal in the humid highland forests (Tattersal &amp; Sussman 1975; Tattersal 1978). This species appears to be clearly monogamous but in one particular region 50 per cent. of the groups had 2-3 each of both sexes (Tattersal I978). The mystery of the mixed existence of both types requires further research. The monogamous BSU type is preserved among many diurnal speciae, and I have already mentioned that it is found in all families. This signifies that all other BSU types were born from the monogamous BSU. If one basic structure, that in which one male and one female are linked, is placed as the original type, then the other BSU structures could have come about with its disintegration or reconstruction. The distribution of social structures within each family or subfamily is presented in table 2. Evolution unfolded in different directions within each taxon: the Lemurinae towards matrilineal groups, the Cebidae towards bilateral, the Colobinae towards bilateral, the Cercopithecinae towards matrilineal, the Pongidae towards the polygynous and patrilineal groups. In the Callitrichidae, although no species has been proved monogamous in the wild (Sussman &amp; Kinzey 1984), probably the evolutionary trend has been from monogamous groups to polyandrous and bilateral groups.

Ofthe three lineal structures, the bilateral is found in two platyrrhine families and the Colobinae, but it is not found in the Cercopithecinae and Pongidae. The latter two taxa diverge dramatically with the Cercopithecinae becoming matrilineal and the Pongidae patrilineal. These two structures may have attained a higher degree of complete- ness considering the precision of the group perpetuation mechanisms.</page><page sequence="13">JUNICHIRO ITANI 605 The six BSU types, the elemental society without BSUs, and their rela- tionships are presented in fig. 3. A line was drawn between each structural type for each family with both types. Arrows were drawn, first from the elemental society to the monogamous structure, then to the structures resulting from either the disintegration or reconstruction of monogamy, and then towards structures in which lineality is assured. Whether the social structures of the primates actually evolved along these developmental lines is a question for future research. Two speciae have been excluded from this figure. One is that of the hamadryas baboon which may be in transition from a matrilineal to patrilineal structure, and the potentially patrilineal clan may be a lower level unit of the original BSU. The second excluded specia is the orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus). The only exception within the simians, its specia must be the result of the disintegration of the pair group, and cannot be placed on fig. 3. (Note that FIGURE 3.

What can be said about the origin of human society? This problem has long been debated within social anthropology, but I believe it is strongly related to the right side of figure 3, and I should like to mention that the BSUs of the genus Pan have many similarities to the bands of the hunter-gatherer peoples. Towards a theory of coexistence I have so far considered the diachronic structures ofprimate speciae. Each specia is maintained by its members. The social structures so far described were iden- tified through the analysis of the behaviour of individuals, and so it is time we turned our attention to social behaviour. The debate concerning whether behaviour is innate or acquired is not important. Furthermore, research on the social behaviour of primates has excessively focused on individuals, and on understanding the principles of competition. In my opinion, we must approach an understanding of the value system of the primates and in order to do so it is important to pursue the principle of coexistence. For example the inter-specia relations revealed by numerous researchers, perhaps against their own expectations, among the nocturnal prosimians of Gabon (Charles-Dominique I977) and Madagascar (Charles-Dominique et al. I980), diurnal prosimians of Madagascar (Sussman 1974), South American Platyrrhine (Klein &amp; Klein I975; Terborgh I983), guenons of Cameroon (Struhsaker I969) and semidesert baboons of Ethiopia (Nagel I973; Sugawara I982), beautifully demonstrate the reality of coexistence rather than com- petition. Theories of coexistence have not been constructed, and we must admit that consideration, from the angle of coexistence, of within-specia social relations (for which there is a great deal more material than between-specia relations) is still very immature. My own thoughts are very preliminary (Itani I984), but I would suggest that coexistence is based either on the principle of inequality or on the principle of equality. Inequality is based on the one-dimensional rule of dominance- subordinance, but equality can produce far more variegated social interactions. Comparing the speciae of macaques and chimpanzees, the latter already have a society which cannot be regulated simply by inequality, but must rely on the more multi-dimensional rules conforming to the equality principle. They are clearly moving towards a more equal society like those we see among hunter- gatherer peoples. What makes coexistence possible or impossible? What does it mean for an individual to have an identity as a member of a particular group, and also to give up that identity? These questions are deeply concerned with what I have called the social value system and their 'mind' as one member of a specia. In a reductionist way of thinking, these are what create their social structures, but we are far from a true understanding. This does not mean we have made no progress. Here is one example. The complete pedigree is known for the Arashiyama B troop of Japanese</page><page sequence="15">JUNICHIRO ITANI 607 macaques. Takahata has conducted a detailed study of the sexual behaviour of the troop and also demonstrated the existence of incest avoidance in this troop (Takahata I980; i982a; i982b). He discovered that male-female dyads that mated frequently during a mating season formed a special relationship, which he called the peculiar-proximate relation (PPR) in the subsequent non-mating season. In the following mating seasons, however, this male and female dyad avoided sexual relations. This non-sexual relationship probably continues as long as both individuals reside in the same troop. Takahata has further pointed out that the behaviour of PPR dyads is very similar to that of kin-related male-female dyads. We must all be aware now that incest avoidance is deeply involved in the formation of primate social structure, and the discovery of PPRs may throw light upon this important question. As the final comment I should like to touch upon a few examples of the extreme negation of coexistence. Examples of intra-specific killing have been reported recently among many species, leading to much debate. There are two points concerning intra-specific killing which I believe are important (Itani I982). First intra-specific killing is found in the structurally more complex specia, and the phylogenetically more evolved species. Within the superfamily Ceboidea, infanticide is known only among the red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) (Sekulic I983), but a great variety of episodes are known within five genera of Cercopithecidae, and, within Pongidae, among both chimpanzees and gorillas. Notably, episodes within BSUs have been reported only for three species, the chimpanzee, gorilla and silver lutong (Presbytis cristatus), but epi- sodes between BSUs or with individuals outside of BSUs have been observed in ten species of seven genera. If the Cercopithecidae and Pongidae are compared, the episodes of the latter show greater variety and complexity, and infanticide by chimpanzees is accompanied by cannibalism. Searching for the motives and triggers of the killings is indeed a fascinating problem but here I should like to point out one consequence of the killings. The individuals who play the role of the killers in each episode are modifying the specia of which they are a member. We have until now treated primate societies as entirely natural phenomena, but we now see that within some primate societies the members are themselves altering its shape. One example is the chimpanzee. Early in our research we became aware of the biased sex ratio of their BSU (Itani &amp; Suzuki I967; Nishida I968). After the groups at Gombe and Mahale were provisioned and detailed observations became possible, no bias was found in the sex ratio of newborn infants (Goodall I983; Hiraiwa-Hasegawa et al. I984). We originally expected to find solitary males but so far not one has been discovered. Instead we found that only the females migrated between groups (Nishida &amp; Kawanaka I972; Kawanaka &amp; Nishida I975). The mystery, however, may have been solved. Ever since Suzuki (I97I) first observed cannibalism among the chimpanzees of Budongo, seven cases at Gombe, and six cases at Mahale have been recorded. Kawanaka in his study stated with some diffidence, 'It seems that more male infants were killed by conspecifics than female infants'. (I98I: 83). All six victims at Mahale have been males. Of the seven victims at Gombe, three were male, three female, and one individual's sex was unknown. But of these, four victims were eaten by</page><page sequence="16">608 JUNICHIRO ITANI a rather abnormal female named Passion, and two of her victims were female. The single remaining female victim's death was not accompanied by cannibal- ism, unlike all the other cases. If these cases can be excluded, all the remaining victims were male. We have thus been observing BSUs in which the structures had been modified by the removal of a portion of the male infants. The meaning of this phenomenon for social evolution can only be understood by future research. Cannibalism among chimpanzees occurs both within and between BSUs, but the killing episodes involving adults all occur between BSUs (Goodall et al. 1979; Nishida et al. I985). As a final comment, I should like to say that the BSUs of each primate species have passed through remarkable structural changes within each specia. BSUs have developed a variety of regulatory mechanisms to ensure the coexistence of their members. But, generally speaking, relations between BSUs seem to be conspicuously undeveloped. A discontinuity is maintained between BSUs and the BSUs are maintained by the discontinuity, even within the multi-level societies. The male chimpanzees of different groups are apparently in a state of severe confrontation, involving even murder. How this will be resolved during the course of social evolution is an important problem.
