More than the completed work of art, the artists' motions represent the tangible outcome of their motives in that they orga- nize those motions in time and space. Thus, the study of motions can become a means of exploring the art work's meaning. It may be possible to examine Paleolithic art diachronically or synchronically in terms of the evolu- tion of technical or operational facts (Lorblanchet 1988; Lemonnier 1983, 1986) rather than of its style, which is the ultimate expression of those facts. At the same time, a series of motions or technical operations is generally employed not in isolation but in the context of the cul- tural heritage shared by the members of the group and other groups belonging to the same cultural unit. Be- yond its possible implications for our knowledge of the meaning of prehistoric art and its function in prehistoric societies, the study of technical operations therefore brings to light a historical legacy of collective behaviour and individual variation. The first aim of the research reported here was to de- velop an experimental method for investigating prehis- toric engravings technically and operationally and then to demonstrate the validity of the method by testing it on a large sample of such engravings. The second aim was to use the method to describe the behaviour of pre- historic engravers from the Azilian period (10, 000-8000 B.C.) in order to obtain a better understanding of the meaning of their art. The lively interest in this art and the difficulty of its interpretation have been emphasized by a number of scholars (Piette 1895, 1896; Peyrony 1934; Pequart and Pequart 1936; Leroi-Gourhan 1971; Thevenin 1983; Couraud 1985; Couraud and Lorblan- chet 1986). Azilian art developed in Europe at the end of the last glaciation and the beginning of the Holocene (Thevenin 1982, COHMAP 1988, Huntley 1990). Along- side of the technological changes in stone and bone tool industries that occurred during that period (J. K. Koztow- ski 1979, S. L. Koztowski 1979, Thevenin 1982, Camp- bell 1986, Schild 1988, Otte 1988, Desbrosse and Koztowski 1988) there were changes in artistic represen- tations: parietal animal art disappeared, portable art be- came more frequent, and there was a definite shift to- wards abstraction (Leroi-Gourhan 1971). The art of this period, especially in France, has the advantage for our purposes of providing numerous pieces that are stylisti- cally homogeneous and on the whole well dated. There- fore an analysis of Azilian art offers a unique opportu- nity to explore in depth the dynamics of the relation between climatic and cultural change. Recent comparative microscopic analysis of experi- mental and archaeological engravings (d'Errico 1987; 1988a, b; n.d.e)has revealed the existence of clues allowing one to determine, among other things, the di- rection of movement of the point, whether the lines were engraved by the same tool, the order in which they were made, and the time required to engrave them. In a study of the abstract engravings of the French Epipaleo- lithic (146 incised pebbles from 25 sites [see fig. 1) I have demonstrated that they were always made by rapid, repetitive tool movements (d'Errico 1989a-c, n.d.e). In many cases, all the incisions on a given pebble were produced by the same tool in a single series of opera- tions. This finding suggests that these engravings were not, as has been supposed, lunar calendars or hunting tallies, since these would have been created in several distinct operations over a relatively long period and probably with more than one tool (d'Errico 1989a). Moreover, a re-examination of the literature on the iden- tification of systems of notation has shown (see d'Errico 1989c, n.d.e; Bahn 1989a; Lewin 1989) that the criteria I. c I992 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

FROM BEHAVIOUR TO MEANING The microscopic features whose existence I have dem- onstrated experimentally make it possible to look be- yond the incised lines to the sequence of motions em- ployed by the prehistoric artists. The advantage of this investigative procedure is that it transforms purely ar- chaeological data (incised drawings) into operational be- haviour. This means that engravings can be classified in terms of the operational concepts that led to their creation. Technical reconstructions help us to understand how the surface was moved in space and how the prehistoric engravers themselves saw the incised design as it gradu- 2. Various objects dated to the Upper Paleolithic have also been interpreted as systems of notation, but this is far from proven. The marks described as notations include sequences of single-stroke lines (produced by a single movement of the tool tip), notches (pro- duced by a back-and-forth movement of the cutting edge), and mi- crocupules (produced by a rotation or pressure of the tool tip) on stone, bone, antler, ivory, and amber. Because of this, the criteria used to analyze them necessarily differ. Recent research (d'Errico n.d.a, b) has highlighted microscopic and statistical criteria for the study of notches that are currently being applied to art objects from the European Paleolithic. Moreover, previous research proposing identification of notation systems presumed that some objects showed evidence of long manipulation and/or transport (e.g., Mar- shack I970). However, no explicit methods were offered for differ- entiating these traces from natural or other artificial ones. A recent experimental study (d'Errico n.d.f) describes criteria for identifying such traces on objects of bone, antler, and ivory.</page><page sequence="3">96 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY COlUXFINGm4RVING \ ENG.FRACTURE so - ENG.RAVING2+FL&lt;INGi E 40 _ \ \ENGRNLOURI ._I _ \ \ FLAK&lt;ING+ENGRAVING AL 30 _\ \4HAMERSTONE+ENGRAVING \ ENGRAVING+IWTONE+E xNGRAVIG+ s-20-HMEWN 0' OOLOUFUNG.ENGRAVING.FRACTURE EGRAIGHAMthEFSTONE+ENGRAVING B ENGRAVING+FLAViNG+ENGRAVING 4 FLAKING+OOLOURNG+ENGRAVING \E \ \ \ OLOUNGINGANG+FLAKNG 3 \ \ N\E\RVI NG ENGRAVING+PERFORATION+ a 2- _ ....................... \ \ \PERFORATIONJ 0 FIG. 2.

Thus we can follow both the develop- ment of a general plan and the individual technical and operational choices of the moment. Apart from a few researchers (Pales and Tassin de Saint-Pereuse I969, I976; Mons I972; Marshack I972, I979a, b; Otte I974; Dauvois I974; Cremades I989; White I990), prehistori- ans have become accustomed to static, museographic representations of the incised or painted portable objects of the Paleolithic. However, object and operations tell a story that can be traced in the microscopic indications unknowingly left on the piece by the artist. The evidence of the very rapid production of the Azil- ian engravings and the large number of pebbles incised with the same design allow comparison of the various motion sequences involved in producing them. The act of engraving may have been part of a series of behaviours preceding and/or following it that represents either a chain of motions involved in realizing the engraving or previous or subsequent uses of the piece. If the former was the case, the meaning of these behaviours, which can be taken to include the location and selection of the raw material, is probably associated with the meaning of the engraving. In contrast to items of portable Paleolithic art mainly used for adornment (Hahn I972, Bosinski and Hahn I973, Bahn I977, Taborin n.d., White I990), Azilian art objects came primarily from the area surrounding the site, often from the nearest stream. This suggests that the pieces were incised at or near the site where they were discovered and on completion probably did not en- ter into a regular exchange network. Half of the faces analyzed 19 out of I97) retain more or less intense traces of colouring (fig. a). Surfaces were generally coloured before engraving. The systematic as- pect of this behaviour seems to indicate that preliminary colouring of the surface may have been an integral part of the operational sequence. This would indicate that the meaning attributed to the engraving was global, that is, not dissociated from that of the surface. Traces of colouring on many pieces are now barely visible, and therefore the importance of colouring is probably under- estimated because it may have been practised without leaving traces that are perceptible today. Twenty-one pieces bear marks due to hammering and chipping. In a number of cases, chipping is due to the prolonged use of the pebbles as hammers; in other cases it is produced by the fashioning of larger-sized pebbles into choppers or chopping tools. Pebbles tended to be fashioned or used as hammers mainly after engraving, but the reverse also occurred. In a few cases, engraving took place between two episodes of use as a hammer. This suggests that the engravings had symbolic value even though the pieces were used as tools. It also sug- gests that pebbles may have been picked up without any intention of using them for engraving. That the pebbles were sometimes both incised and used as tools might suggest a relationship between design and function, but this hypothesis must be abandoned because barely more than io% of the pebbles examined had been so used. The group of pebbles with two opposed series of lines from Rochedane constitutes the richest set of engravings of the same design dating from this period. It has proved possible to reconstruct the chain of motions used to en- grave 27 of the 42 faces incised with this design (fig. 3). This analysis reveals that the only systematically main- tained behaviour, identified in 57 of the 6i series in which the direction of adding new lines could be deter- mined, was fashioning each series by aligning each new incision to the right of the preceding one. The logic that guided the engravers' motions seems to have involved rapidly fashioning the piece with as few rotations of the surface as possible. On i6 of the 27 peb- bles, work was limited to engraving two opposed series (9 cases) or adding "fringes" to these latter (7 cases). It was logical to add "fringes" after completing the two opposed series, since the series served as a guideline for fashioning them. On 2 additional pebbles more complex designs were added after this last stage. The 9 other faces showed different sequences of motions: (i) one or both opposed series seem to have been reincised before adding the external "fringes" (3 cases); (2) the fashioning of the two series seems to have been interrupted by the engrav- ing of a central or an external "fringe" (4 cases); or (3) the central "fringe" seems to have been incised before the two opposed series (2 cases). Except for three cases (Roi I, i6, and I9), this variation appears to have been a result of the variability of the design. Indeed, where peb- bles have a central "fringe," it is logical that it was made either between the two series or before both-in the first case serving as a guideline for engraving the second series and in the second case serving as a guideline for engraving both. The apparently illogical progression of the other three sequences can be explained in terms of their particular features. For instance, one face of ROIS~ bears the only example of a central "fringe" consisting</page><page sequence="4">Volume 33, Number i, February I992 197 II,,,)-) * RO 16 ~~ * ~~~RO0 15 RO 19 FIG. 3.

It is no surprise, then, that in this case the central "fringe" was incised at the same time as the upper external "fringe." While fashioning one "fringe," the engraver used the same position of the pebble to engrave the other. On pebble RoI9, the fashioning of one series was followed by the fashioning of the lower external "fringe"; on Roi6 the central "fringe" was in- cised after the two opposed series. Thus, although sim- plicity appears to have been the rule, this did not exclude individual variability in human behaviour. Another example of the coexistence of simplicity with operational variation in Azilian art comes from Le Mas d'Azil, where parallel bands of lines were incised in rapid succession, generally without changing the posi- tion of the surface, but on one occasion (M.A.N. 83652- I 35 ) the engraver, probably influenced by the triangular shape of the pebble, rotated it after fashioning one band and before doing the other.</page><page sequence="5">98 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY AB U a ~~~~~ai IC1 1 cm FIG. 4. Reconstruction of the succession of lines on Page's 26, faces A and B. Still another example is pebble 26 from the Pages shel- ter (fig. 4). Both of its faces bear the same incised design, and microscopic analysis has shown that the engravings were produced swiftly and that the same tool was used to incise both. Therefore the same person certainly in- cised the two faces in succession. Despite the fact that the two designs involve virtually identical motions, be- havioural differences creep in during the last phase of fashioning (fig. 4, C and CI), where two short lines that meet at one extremity of the design are incised starting from the same point on one face and in a successive motion on the other. Again, on both faces there are three oblique lines on each side of the central drawing, three going away from the central design and three going to- wards it, but the direction in which the tool is moved to make these incisions is reversed on the two faces. As at Rochedane and at Le Mas d'Azil, the operational code is repetitive but not rigid. To say that the engraver employed the simplest mo- tions does not mean, however, that these motions were unplanned. For instance, the design incised on Roche- dane pebbles Roio (fig. 5) and Ro64 was made in two stages. First several sets of oblique lines were incised equal distances apart. Then other sets of lines oriented differently from the first were added on top of these. The double group of lines was then repeated until the entire edge of the pebble was covered. The sequence of motions used to engrave these pebbles clearly shows that the or- ganization of the design and the sequence of motions necessary to achieve it were perfectly well known in advance. In conclusion, the analysis shows that the en- graver was apparently more interested in the overall result of the engraving than in the method used to achieve it. The single element of behavioural rigidity-the inci- sion of lines from left to right-might perhaps be as-</page><page sequence="6">Volume 33, Number I, February I992 I 99 a b d e f 4 cm F9e s t oh c ion o c no9 FIG. 5.

Observation of the en- graving of pebbles by experimental subjects (d'Errico n.d.e) reveals that the direction of juxtaposition is depen- dent not only on laterality but also on the orientation of the line in relation to the engraver's position. This means that right-handed people find it perfectly natural to engrave sequences of lines identical to the Azilian ones equally well to the right or to the left. The choices made by these modem engravers are not completely hap- hazard. Two possibilities are open to them (fig. 6): trac- ing the lines obliquely towards oneself (in which case a right-handed person will juxtapose lines from left to right and a left-handed one from right to left) and engrav- ing the lines horizontally (in which case lines tend to be juxtaposed from top to bottom, a right-handed person incising them from right to left and a left-handed person from left to right). These behaviours can be explained in at least two ways: First, engraving requires accuracy and constant control of the hand and arm muscles. Juxtaposing lines according to the natural motion of the hand allows the engraver to move his hand from one line to the next with a mere momentary relaxation of the muscles; mo- tion sequencing is therefore easy and natural. Second, if he is to achieve a series of juxtaposed parallel lines, the engraver cannot lose sight of the lines already com- pleted. A left-handed person engraving towards the body will be hampered in juxtaposing lines to the right be- cause the tool and his fingers will partly hide the lines already drawn, and the same goes for a right-handed per- son following the same procedure and trying to juxta- pose lines to the left. For the same reason, both right- handed and left-handed engravers working horizontally will find it difficult to juxtapose lines from the bottom upwards. The series of lines in the Azilian engravings show jux- taposition from left to right. They may therefore have been made by right-handed persons engraving towards the body or by left-handed persons engraving horizon- tally. The former hypothesis seems by far the more plau- sible. The small percentage of juxtapositions done from right to left could be attributed to the presence among Azilians of the same proportion of left-handed persons as in a natural population of Homo sapiens sapiens today (approximately io%). However, since it is perfectly nat- ural to employ either procedure or even to alternate de- pending on the possibilities of grip offered by the piece, series of lines incised at random by present-day right- handed persons would also include series juxtaposed</page><page sequence="7">IOO j CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY RIGHT- LEFT | HR RIGHT-I{ANDER LEFTPRIGHT JUXTAPOSITION LE~JUXTAPOSITION OUTWARDS (UTWAS2 L I I'W .I'14 LEFT- RIGHT WORKING WORKING RIGHT- LEFT JUXTAPOSITION TOWARDS ONESELF TOWARDS ONESELF JUXTAPOSITION FIG. 6. Possibilities for juxtaposition of lines in incising a series of parallel lines depending on the position of the surface and the laterality of the engraver. from right to left. The repeated choice of juxtaposition from left to right therefore does not seem to be dictated by the mere fact that the Azilians were right-handed, and it is possible to suggest that this operational homo- geneity, so different from experimental reality, may be cultural in origin. If this had been ritual behaviour, for instance, it would have had a particular meaning, of intrinsic value, that would have led to a specific, intended end result in the engraving. However, if the act of engraving had indeed been "sacralized" we would expect to find similar rigid- ity in the fashioning of other incised elements. On the contrary, we have seen that, in spite of a certain basic constancy, various behavioural alternatives are possible. This hypothesis must therefore be discarded. Another hypothesis is that of preferential orientation of the sur- face associated with the meaning of the engraving. For example, a Christian would not design a sloping cross even if this facilitated the process of engraving. Simi- larly, Azilians might have juxtaposed the lines to the right, engraving them cowards themselves, because of the image they had of the engraving while fashioning it. Two facts, at least, seem to contradict this hypothesis. First, in all the engravings with two opposed series the surface was rotated i800 between one series and the next. In addition, the engraving of the two opposed se- ries shows a definite symmetry systematically corre- sponding to the main axis of the surface. It is difficult to imagine that an engraver aiming at this symmetry would at the same time have attached importance to the orientation of the surface during the engraving. It therefore appears obvious that adopting a single direc- tion of juxtaposition of the lines is not ritual behaviour. It would rather seem to be a technical behaviour learnt and assimilated by members of the group. I propose that its systematic adoption was the consequence of an equi- librium stemming purely from neuromotor (laterality) and cultural (learning through imitation, tradition, etc.) factors. How does discovering the order of motions help us to discover the meaning of the engraving? We have seen that each engraving was made without changing tools, using a series of repeated motions. Several elements in- dicate that the engraver cannot have attributed any par- ticular significance to the individual lines of a given se- ries; the line exists only as a unit in the composition of a series. In seeking the meaning of Azilian art, then, we must discount the line and concentrate solely on the set of lines-the engraving as a whole. The engraved space seems to have a certain importance either in relation to an opposite engraved space or in relation to the part of the surface left free of lines. The incised surfaces, how- ever, do not all look the same. Microscopic analysis has shown that the speed and accuracy of the motion vary with the surface but remain constant for any given one. The attempt to achieve stylistic homogeneity on each individual surface is obvious on pebbles on which two similar designs have been superimposed (see CA 3o: 49i-500). Here the lines of the second design are finer and more rapidly incised. It is as if the engraver knew in advance that this second engraving would transform the series into an inextricably interwoven design-at</page><page sequence="8">Volume 33, Number i, February 1992 1 IOI 0 2 cm FIG. 7. Orientation attributed to Azilian incised designs following implementation of the engraved surface as a pendant. a,b, reconstruction of the orientations chosen successively for the two faces of the bone pendant from the Grotte du Roc (Gironde); c, orientation of perforated pebble from Rochedane (RoI4) when used as a pendant. the same time respecting the symmetry of the design and even seeming to enhance it. This observation is im- portant, for we find engravings identical in composition but very different in the precision of the incising and the care taken in their production. This variation confers a specific character upon each abstract engraving without departing from the basic design. We cannot but attribute this fact to variation in individual behaviour, and this implies that the stylistic variation of engravings of the same type in no way alters their meanings. We must therefore conclude that it was the incised design as a whole that meant something to the Azilian engraver. Going on to consider the meaning of the surface, we observe that the engravers did not stop on approaching the edge of the pebble. On the contrary, they helped maintain contact between the tool and the surface by twisting their wrists slightly so as to carry the tip to the very edge. This behaviour is general in Azilian art; painted pebbles follow the same rule. It conveys the im- pression that the lines or painted designs continue onto the other face of the pebble, as if the artists wanted to make it look as if the other side were decorated also. This impression is confirmed by the fact that, as men- tioned earlier, in several cases the same design was in- cised on both faces of the same piece. The location of this engraving confirms the importance of the surface. That the meaning of the engraving is linked to its position on the surface is indicated by the fact that the two opposed series (from Rochedane, Pages, Dufaure, Gay, Espelugues, Gourdan, La Vache, and Borie del Rey) always occupy one part of the pebble and the fact that the major axis of the surface systematically coincides with the dividing axis of the two series. The few Azilian pendants confirm this (d'Errico n.d.e). Analysis of a bone pendant from the Grotte du Roc (fig. 7) has revealed that the face engraved with a fanlike motif was done before that engraved with two opposed series. To suspend the pendant on the fan side, the prehistoric engraver pierced a hole at its top in order to orient the fan downwards; to suspend it with the other side showing, the engraver pierced a second hole which orients the pendant along the dividing line of the two opposed series and keeps the series at the top. Only one Azilian pebble has a perfora- tion (Thevenin i982:3 82), and in this case also the perfo- ration orients the pebble along the dividing axis of the two opposed series. It therefore seems certain that this</page><page sequence="9">IO21 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY axis must also be the axis along which the Azilians ori- ented the design. The pendants show that the part with- out lines must have been oriented towards the bottom. These observations reveal that, for the Azilian en- graver, the surface had very specific importance, not only representing the raw material on which the engrav- ing was made but also, by its morphology and volume, contributing to its meaning. The Azilian engraved sur- face is therefore a sort of symbolic "sculpture." Analysis of the engraver's motions shows that the idea of duality is present in most of the Azilian incised designs. This is true not only of the opposed series but also of the fan designs (Roc de Marcamps, Grotte du Roc, Pages 24, Murat, Campalou). Thus, in fashioning the plaquette from Roc de Marcamps the engraver achieved the fan by setting out two symmetrical spaces and filling them in, independently of the lines that came later. (From the technical point of view these results agree with those published by Marshack [1I979a1 for this piece.) The suc- cession of lines on Pages 24 and on one face of the Grotte du Roc pendant highlights a similar process. In addition, the presence of two opposed series on the other face of the pendant is proof that the two designs are closely related. This relation is also demonstrated by the occur- rence of several intermediate designs (for example, in the Murat and Pages shelters). If, as it seems, these engravings are symbolic, two pos- sibilities can be envisaged as regards their meaning: they may be the expression of an abstract concept, or they may represent the extremely schematic outlines of a figurative representation. If the former is the case, we will never be able to discover the concept expressed. If the latter, the discovery of such an "archetype" will not reveal the meaning of the engravings, but it will enable us to identify the figurative symbol to which they refer. To sound out the second hypothesis, it is useful to ex- amine how Azilian abstract art relates to Azilian figura- tive art and to the artistic manifestations of other facies of the European Epipaleolithic. THE HYPOTHESIS OF A FIGURATIVE ARCHETYPE Virtually all of the Azilian figurative representations come from south-western France (Coulonges I963; Ce- lerier I984, I986; Lorblanchet I986; Lorblanchet and Welte I990; Roussot I990; d'Errico n.d.e; d'Errico and Roussot n.d.), and they seem to fall into two types: i. Recent excavations in the Murat shelter (Lor- blanchet I986, Lorblanchet and Welte i990) have shown that in the transition from Magdalenian to Azilian Magdalenian-style animal figures persist alongside an increase in the frequency of unstructured incised ele- ments and abstract designs. In the same levels, however, we find figures whose contours are simplified and rounded, as well as others whose engraving, more am- biguous in appearance, is achieved by successive re- touching. 2. In other sites (Pont d'Ambon, Borie del Rey, Morin), horses and aurochs are engraved on splinters of long bone. The bodies of these animals are intentionally elon- gated and out of proportion with their legs. Heads and limbs are rendered by a finely incised chequered pattem. Bodies are generally filled in with series of parallel lines or other abstract designs. The Azilian engraver seems to have ascribed more importance to the abstract designs used in filling in the animal contours than to the ana- tomical features as such, as if the designs were funda- mental to the identification of the symbol. On a lynx metapodial found at Pont d'Ambon (d'Errico n.d.e) the engraver, by adding a few lines and a small circle care- fully incised following the natural morphology of the proximal epiphysis, seems to have sketched out a head; the diaphysis shows two parallel series of engravings. This object seems a good example of the almost com- plete schematization of a representation of figurative or- igin. These and other cases indicate that in Azilian art figurative, schematic, and abstract all stem from the same symbolic world. By comparing figurative and ab- stract representations we may manage to grasp the exis- tence of one or more figurative referents underlying the abstract designs without, however, being able to identify them. The contemporary Epipaleolithic facies (Creswellian, Final Epigravettian, Ahrensburgian, and so on), despite their distinctive stone and bone tool industries, display the same main evolutionary trends; their technology also has a common base (Djindjian i988). As regards art, there are many commonalities that also seem to allow the drawing of parallels, even over great distances. If, within the so-called Azilian period, we find the same incised and painted design in the Pyrenees and some i,000 km away in the Jura, we should not be surprised to find an alternative version of this same design (the Pages type) engraved on a pebble found in the Creswel- lian levels of Gough's Cave (Tratman I976, Charles i99i). Pebbles or painted limestone plaquettes associ- ated with the industries of the Final Magdalenian and Federmesser technocomplex in Germany (Hahn and von Koenigswald I977; Bosinski I982, personal communica- tion) have been found in Obere Klause (Kreis Kelheim) and Kleine Scheuer (Hohlenstein). At Niederbieber (Neuwied, Rhineland) an engraved sandstone shaft- straightener was found associated with a typical Feder- messer industry dated by covering pumice layers to the late Allerod interstadial (Loftus i982), and it is suggested that a series of parallel lines running along the piece could represent a final schematisation of the engravings of female figures known from Gonnersdorf. Two of the three notched pebbles from Lommel (Belgium), dating from the Final Creswellian-Tjongerian period (Dewez I98I, I987; Lejeune i987), are like the Azilian pebbles in comprising two "upper" series of opposed notches accompanied by a "lower" series following the axis of symmetry of the former two and the axis of symmetry of the surface. Epipaleolithic abstract art developed not only on the Atlantic coast of the Iberian peninsula (Femarndez- Tresguerres I980, I98I; Apellaniz i982; Gonzales Sainz I98I, I989; Beltran I987; d'Errico n.d.d; D'Errico, Gui- laine, and Rivenq n.d.) but also on the Spanish Mediter-</page><page sequence="10">Volume 33, Number I, February 1992 I I03 ranean coast (Fullola i Pericot and Vinas i Vallverdu I988; Fullola i Pericot, Vinas i Vallverdu, and Garcia- Arguelles i Andreu I990; Utrilla I990). In addition, re- cent discoveries at Neria, Malaga (Pellicier and Acosta I986), San Gregori, Catalunya (Fullola et al. I990), Tos- sal de la Roca and Cova del Barranc, Alicante (Aparicio Perez and San Valero Aparisi I983, Ripoll Lopez and Ca- cho Quesada I987, Cacho Quesada and Ripoll Lopez I987), and Matutano, Castellon (Olaria et al. I98I) show that, in Spain just as in France, figurative art did not come to a sudden end. The abstract art of the Italian Final Epigravettian, con- temporaneous with Azilian art, confirms that this cul- tural facies follows the same trend towards abstraction both in the north (Cardini I946, I972; Broglio and Lol- lini I98I; Dalmeri I985) and in the south (Radmilli I974, Graziosi I973, Borzatti Von I965) of the peninsula. Recent discoveries from Serratura Cave (Martini n.d.) and from Veneri di Parabita and Marisa Caves (Cre- monesi n.d.) confirm this. The Epigravettian burial of the Villabruna shelter (Valle Cismon, Venetia) recently excavated by Broglio (n.d.) includes several small slabs painted with abstract designs similar to the designs painted on Azilian pebbles. The best-preserved block de- picts symmetrical fringes starting from a central line that are strongly reminiscent of the Pages-Gough's Cave version of the two opposed series. From Romanelli Cave (Blanc I930, Acanfora I967, Graziosi I973, Priuli I987) come many incised abstract designs as well as chequered figurative representations bearing an aston- ishing resemblance to the filled-in Azilian animals from the south-west (Pont d'Ambon, Borie del Rey, Morin) and from Gouy Cave. These latter figures bear some re- semblance to the parietal art of the Epigravettian site of Badanj, in Bosnia (Basler I979), and of the more recently discovered Pecina Cave (Kujundzic I989). This is not, of course, to deny the existence of specific regional features or their value in identifying social groups. Regional tendencies did exist, but we must not allow them to obscure the overall "transcultural" aspect of the art of the period. The evolution of the art of the populations of Westem Europe between the Allerod and the Pre-Boreal seems, in spite of some regionalization, to show a constancy of content if not always of style. Four sites contemporary with the Azilian period (Vado All'Arancio, Geldrop III-i, Cala dei Genovesi, and Grotta della Madonna) have produced representations that may open up a line of research into the figurative archetype on which some Azilian abstract designs are based. The site of Vado All'Arancio (Grosseto, Italy), at- tributed to the Final Epigravettian and dated to II,330 ? 50 B.P. (Graziosi I973; Minellono I985, I987), has yielded several incised pieces of stone and bone. An en- graved ibex is reminiscent of the filled-in animals of south-western France. One bone fragment has several engravings on it, including a feminine figure character- ized by a large pubic triangle (fig. 8). The Ahrensburgian site of Geldrop (North Brabant, the Netherlands), attrib- uted to the end of Dryas III (Bohmers and Wouters i962, Rozoy I978), has produced a pebble used as a retouching FIG. 8. Feminine figure from Grotta di Vado All'Arancio (Grosseto, Italy) (redrawn from Graziosi 1973 and Minellono I987). tool that is incised with a feminine figure (fig. 9). These two figures, quite different from Magdalenian ones, are seen in front view, with legs apart; the limbs are in per- fect proportion. The originality of the Geldrop figure raised doubts as to its authenticity, but the recent dis- covery of the piece from Vado All'Arancio seems to dis- pel them. The Geldrop figure wears a filled-in loincloth with a fringed edge. The importance attached to this element seems clear from its central position and the technique of engraving employed; in contrast to the extremely fine lines of the body, the lines of the loincloth are deeply incised. The resemblance and the contemporaneity of the two figures lead us to identify the triangle of the Vado All'Arancio figure as a loincloth. At least from the formal viewpoint, this loincloth clearly provides ele- ments for comparison with several Azilian abstract de- signs (the "fringes" of plaquette A from La Pommeraye and the engraved pebbles of the Murat, Pages, Mar- gineda, Bois-Ragot, and Dufaure shelters). The pebble from Dufaure is worthy of attention in that it is the only instance in which a ladder-like design with a "fringed" edge is associated with two opposed series (d'Errico n.d.c, e). From Cala dei Genovesi Cave (Levanzo, Sicily) come two painted pebbles attributed to the Mesolithic (Grazi- osi I973), and the Epigravettian levels of Grotta della Madonna (Calabria) have produced five painted pebbles dated to io,I20-9,020 B.P. (the very early Pre-Boreal). One of the pebbles found at the latter site suggests an anthropomorph (see fig. 9); a horseshoe design divided</page><page sequence="11">I04 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY a _3feX ' I?ccm 0 2 0~~~~~~~~~ tt&gt;c&gt;4X\;1 cm FIG. 9.

The two pebbles found in Cala dei Genovesi Cave are strongly reminiscent of the Azilian pebbles incised with the same design, and the larger of them merits at- tention in that a design that might be a headdress is painted above the two series. Could the Azilian incised designs with two opposed series and a fan-shaped design be an extreme schematization of the human silhouette? Cala dei Genovesi Cave has engraved on its walls three human figures (attributed by Graziosi [I9731 to the Pa- leolithic) with internal hatching that resembles that of the pebbles from the Grotta della Madonna. Moreover, with regard to the Azilian pebbles, it is interesting that the orientation given the design by the presumed head- dress corresponds to the orientation identified through the technical analysis. Similarly, if we were to recognize a loincloth in the ladder design of the Abri Dufaure peb- ble, its position would be in agreement with the orienta- tion attributed to the design on technical grounds. The Italian pebbles reflect different stages of schematization. This is important, for it seems to indicate that in the cultural facies contemporary with the Azilian abstrac- tion originated in figurative representations. It was once suggested, on the basis of comparisons to certain anthropomorphic figurations of Levantine sche- matic art, that Azilian painted pebbles were schema- tized representations of the human figure (Obermaier I925, Breuil I957, Acanfora I960, Graziosi i956). This hypothesis has been abandoned for some years, for we know that Levantine art developed at the height of the Holocene (Beltran I987; Fortea Perez I974, I975), and its recent dating to the Mid-Neolithic (Hernandez Perez, Ferrer i Marset, and Catala Ferrer I988, Bahn i989b) eliminates any comparison to the Azilian. It is obvious, in any case, that it would be hazardous to reduce the complexity of Azilian art to a schematization of the hu- man figure. There are several incised and painted designs that cannot be likened either to two opposed series or to a fan or a loincloth (Graves, Murat, Gay, Le Mas d'Azil, Rhodes II, La Vache, Rochereuil). While it is possible that our research has uncovered a link between a partic- ular design (or family of designs) and its figurative "ar- chetype," this link reveals the meaning neither of the design nor of its figurative referent. The importance of this family of designs is, however, apparent from its fre- quency and its geographic distribution. We may ask whether the link between the abstract and the underlying figurative "archetype" was still ap- parent to the Azilians or whether the symbol had al- ready completely taken over from the referent. Certain elements lead us to think that the link had not been lost. The schematic decoration of the animal figures shows that these bore a close relation to the abstract designs. This is confirmed by the fact that some appar- ently abstract designs would seem to suggest animal figures (an engraved lynx metapodial from Pont d'Am- bon, a birdlike design from Abri Gay, pebble 26 from Pages, a schematic fish on a pebble from Rochedane). If the elements animating the Azilian symbolic uni- verse are, as is probable, stably related, the same cannot be said of their occurrence on pebbles. The type of sur- face, the speed of their realization, the discovery on the same site of a large number of virtually identical en- graved or painted objects, and the very few traces of pro- longed handling all indicate that the link established between symbol and design is transient. ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLIC SYSTEM The problem of the origin of the Azilian and the Epipa- leolithic symbolic system in general is at once simple and complex. It is simple in that, from the archaeologi- cal point of view, there is no doubt that there is continu- ity between the end of the Magdalenian and the Azilian. The transition from Magdalenian to Azilian in fact shares the trends which characterize the evolution of all the cultural facies of the European continent between the Bolling-Allerod and the Pre-Boreal. There is no doubt that Azilian artistic manifestations have their source in the Magdalenian symbolic universe (see Nougier and Robert I97I, Lorblanchet I986, Lorblanchet and Welte I990). Another illusory problem is how a figurative art can engender an abstract one; there is no doubt that the abstract is an essential component of all the art of the Upper Paleolithic. Recent studies reveal that Magdale- nian abstract manifestations are extremely rich (Leroi- Gourhan I97I, Casado Lopez I977, Corchon Rodriguez I986). In the decorated caves of the Ariege region (Vialou I986), for example, the abstract and "unstructured" as- pect predominates. The symbolic system which pre- cedes the Azilian therefore rests, as does this one, on a myriad of signs, often juxtaposed and repeated, with variations which enable us to perceive regional differ- ences as well as an evolution over time. One could even, paradoxically, affirm that the richness of the Magdale- nian abstract is such that several Azilian arts could have arisen from it. Also, as we have seen, it is clear that Azilian art is not entirely abstract. The transition to the Azilian does not upset the symbolic balance but shifts its representation towards schematization. It is here that the problem becomes more complex. Although we grasp the continuity between one art and the other, we only partly understand the reasons behind it. It is obvious that they must be sought in climatic change (Couraud I985, Couraud and Lorblanchet I986), but we must avoid overmechanistic solutions. This ex- planation establishes no relationship of cause and effect. It is easy to attribute to natural causes modifications whose cause may lie in changes internal to the original symbolic system. Some of the animals that were the source of the symbolic imaginary world of the Magda- lenian artists died out or migrated towards the end of glaciation, but while this cannot but have had an effect on artistic manifestations it does not necessarily imply a shift towards abstraction. On the Spanish Atlantic (Al- tuna I979, Straus I99I) and Mediterranean coasts and in Italy, no important change in fauna can be observed</page><page sequence="13">io6 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY between the Final Upper Paleolithic and the Epipaleo- lithic, but both the artistic manifestations and the stone and bone tool industries of these regions display the same trends as have been described for the French Azil- ian. Cultural evolution must therefore not be neglected. In comparison with Azilian art, Magdalenian art has the advantage for us of being expressed on cave walls, therefore retaining spatial links between the elements of the symbolic system that may, to a degree, indicate the relative values of those elements. In Azilian art, the elements of the system certainly still entertain recipro- cal relations, but to grasp their relative importance we must depend on links of filiation with the previous cul- ture, the frequency of the designs, and their geographical distribution. It is for this reason that it will be easier to find answers about the origin of Azilian art in the Magdalenian than in the Azilian, although this will require a better definition of Final Magdalenian art (Clottes i990). Our research on Azilian engravings seems to reveal that a large set of abstract designs can be interpreted as an extremely schematized representa- tion of the human figure. Several symptoms of this trend are perceptible in the last manifestations of Magdalenian portable and parietal art. Analyzing two decorated caves (Fronsac and Font-Bargeix) considered, with Gouy Cave, the most recent of those known, Delluc and Delluc (i989) remark: "They are fairly deep corridor-type caves, of difficult access, whose decoration (always including the fundamental bovine-equine duality) introduces in the centre and in the lateral zones much more numerous simplified human representations (vulvas, phalluses, and realistic human silhouettes), thus, on the numeri- cal, topographical, and symbolic level, marginalizing the animal themes."3 Gouy Cave, with a Final Magdalenian stone tool in- dustry that is already Azilianized (Bordes et al. I974), has decorations including eight triangular vulvas with a deeply incised pubis and a schematic human silhouette (Martin I973). A plaquette found on the floor of the cave is incised with a filled-in triangle that can be likened to the loincloth design I have discussed above. A pebble engraved with an identical pattem was found in the Fi- nal Magdalenian level of Bois-Ragot Shelter (Chollet, Reigner, and Butin I974), and a vulva incised on the wall of Gouy Cave shows a similar design. In this cave, realistic animal representations coexist with representa- tions of animals with a chequered pattem similar to that of the Azilian animals engraved on bone fragments from Pont d'Ambon, Borie del Rey, and Mornn and the Italian animals engraved on plaquettes from Vado All'Arancio and Romanelli, some representations tending towards extreme schematization. We seem, here, to be wit- nessing the transition from one artistic world to the other. This cave indeed seems proof of the ability of the Mag- dalenian symbolic system (Levi-Strauss i962) to find a new equilibrium. The Magdalenian was definitively opening up to the external influences which, between the end of the Allerod and the Pre-Boreal, were to pro- duce the great trans-European cultural complex of the curved-backed-point Epipaleolithic facies. We cannot trace the Azilianization of artistic manifestations with- out a better taxonomic definition of the Epipaleolithic techno-complexes of Western Europe. The gradual mi- crolithization of the stone tool industries is a phenome- non which, between the last millennia of the Wurm and the first stages of the Post-Glacial, seems common to Eurasia and North Africa. Can this vast technological phenomenon be considered a symptom of the basic cul- tural unity of these populations? European Epipaleo- lithic art seems to offer an affirmative answer. CONCLUSION The technical analysis of Azilian incised art has enabled us to demonstrate that these objects are neither notation systems nor lunar calendars as has been proposed in the past. The methodological approach adopted calls into question the criteria used by other researchers in arguing for the development of such notational systems as early as the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic. The identifi- cation of systems of notation must in future be based on indices that have been validated experimentally. The case of Azilian art shows that it is possible, through the reconstruction of the motions of their mak- ers, to transform artistic manifestations into collective behaviour patterns and in this way approach an under- standing of their meaning. This analysis has shown that the Azilians attributed symbolic value to the engraving and the surface on which it was made as a whole. Having identified a behaviour, however, it is not always easy to arrive at an interpretation of it. Azilian abstract designs largely escape the conven- tionally accepted boundaries of this techno-complex. Some of them reveal resemblances to anthropomorphic figures that occur in other facies of the European Epipa- leolithic. These designs might be thought of as extreme schematizations of figures of human or animal origin. This possibility, which necessarily remains a working hypothesis, would, however, appear to be strengthened by the results of technical analysis and by an analysis of the artistic manifestations of the latest Magdalenian. 3.
