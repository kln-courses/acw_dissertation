The origin of ideas with such boundless qualities has not yet been successfully accounted for in the cognitive science of religion. In this study I suggest that the domain-general use of recursion underlies the mental representation of boundless qualities. I also examine the contribution of recursive patterns to other aspects of religiosity: the concep tualization of divine agency and the emergence of magical rituals. I suggest that the human ability to use recursion in a domain-general way is minimally required for the human Faculty of Religion in a Narrow Sense. Keywords cognitve science, Faculty of Religion, recursive, boundless, fractals In recent years, the cognitive science of religion has put forward explanations for various aspects of religion. Some of these hypotheses have been subjected to empirical tests, which raised a number of new questions. Let me mention two particular hypotheses about the cognitive foundations of god concepts which I will address in more detail in this study. In terms of the hypothesis of minimal counterintuitiveness, formulated by Pascal Boyer, concepts that min imally violate universally held—innate, or so-called maturationally natural— ontological categories are more memorable than either concepts without such violations or concepts with too many violations (Boyer 1994, 2001; McCauley 2000; Barrett 2008). Whereas the first experiments conducted to test Boyer's theory empirically have entirely confirmed his predictions, even in * I owe thanks to Gregory Alies, Tamás Biró, Joseph Bulbulia, Matthew Day, Armin W.

Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 a cross-cultural sample, subsequent experimentation has shown the influence of various contextual factors on the relative memorability of minimally coun terintuitive concepts (cf. Barrett and Nyhof 2001; Boyer and Ramble 2001; Norenzayan and Atran 2004; Steenstra 2005; Gonce, Upal, Slone andTweney 2006; Slone, Gonce, Upal, Edwards andTweney 2007; Upal, Gonce, Tweney and Slone 2007). All things being equal, however, the advantage of minimally counterintuitive concepts in long-term retention can be regarded to be rela tively well-demonstrated. A new look at Barrett and Nyhof's results reveals that also in their experiment the memory of counterintuitive ideas decayed less; they paid no attention to this probably because of the absolute advantage of such concepts in both immediate and delayed recall among the particular conditions of their experiment (2001: 85-87, 89-90). Based on the cross cultural advantage of minimally counterintuitive concepts in long-term reten tion, the prediction is that such ideas will spread in any human population (cf. Czachesz 2007a-c; 2012). God concepts are admittedly more than just minimally counterintuitive ideas. Theorists using minimal counterintuitive ness to explain religion add other components, such as agency and moral interests, to turn minimally counterintuitive ideas into god concepts (Boyer 2001; Pyysiáinen 2009). Meanwhile Jesse Bering has proposed an alternative account of the birth of god beliefs (Bering 2002; Bering and Bjorklund 2004; Bering, Blasi and Bjorklund 2005; Bering 2006; Bering 2011). He has discovered that whereas people tend to believe that death means an end of the biological functioning of the body, they also tend to believe that emotions, desires, and epistemic states continue after death. Relying on these experimental results, Bering has suggested that afterlife beliefs are "more or less innate." Recent findings by Rita Astuti and Paul L. Harris (2008), however, seem to support a different scenario. Based on their experiments on Madagascar, the authors suggest that beliefs about the afterlife develop gradually as a consequence of older chil dren's participation in the cult of ancestors. Young children (under the age of 7) provide no systematic answers to the question of which functions cease or continue after death. Children at the age of 7 claim that most processes cease to exist after death. Finally, older children and adults believe that whereas bodily functions cease to exist, mental processes continue after death. We have to note the theoretical possibility of "U-shaped learning": very young children might have innate intuitions about afterlife, but get confused as they learn about biological death, and finally make clear distinctions about bodily and mental processes in connection with death after the age of 7. For the time being, however, we cannot take it for granted that afterlife beliefs are innate (or maturationally natural).</page><page sequence="3">I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 5 In this study, I will suggest that another pan-human and innate cognitive capacity underlies the formation of (at least a particular class of) god beliefs, as well as some other religious behavior. Surprisingly, an important aspect of god concepts and other religious beliefs has gone almost unnoticed in the cognitive science of religion. Even a superficial look at religion reveals that many religious traditions embrace ideas that include a boundless element: God is everywhere and knows everything (omnipresent and omniscient), the Buddha has limitless wisdom, sinners eternally suffer in hell, and the righteous shall live in eternal bliss. The origin of ideas with such boundless qualities (to put it simply: things without an end) has not yet been successfully accounted for in the cognitive science of religion. In the first part of the study, I will articulate and defend the hypothesis that the domain-general use of recursion underlies the mental representation of boundless qualities. The significance of recursion has been emphasized earlier by Marc Hauser, Noam Chomsky, and W. Tecumseh Fitch who suggested the existence of a Faculty of Language in a Narrow Sense (i.e., found in humans but not in other animals), which includes at least the domain-general use of recursion (Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch 2002; Kanazawa 2008). In the second part of the study, I will examine the contribution of recursive patterns to other aspects of religiosity: the conceptu alization of divine agency and the emergence of magical rituals. In the final part, I will suggest that the human ability to use recursion in a domain-general way is minimally required for the human Faculty of Religion in a Narrow Sense (FRN). I. Recursion, Fractals, and Scale-fireeness Recursion is a term that was first used in informatics and means that we suc cessively apply an operation to its own result. For example, we can process a list of unknown length by recursively cutting it into a head section (consisting of the first item on the list) and a tail section (the rest of the list). Every time the tail section becomes the input of the next cutting operation, until it will only contain the last item in the list. An important cognitive domain where recursion plays a major role is our concept of numbers. Both humans and many animals can mentally represent numbers (Brannon and Terrace 2000; Hauser, Tsao, Garcia and Spelke 2003; Flombaum, Junge and Hauser 2005). For the representation of large numbers (e.g., the expected income of forag ing), both humans and animals use an approximative strategy (Dehaene 1997; Gallistel and Gelman 2000; Dehaene 2001; Izard and Dehaene 2008); small integers up to 4 are distinguished accurately (Carey 2001; Brannon 2006).</page><page sequence="4">6 I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 There is a major difference, however, with regard to what animals and humans make of their knowledge of small numbers. After having mastered integers up to four, chimpanzees need laborious learning of years to acquire the integer list up to nine (Matsuzawa 1985; Boysen and Hallberg 2000; Kawai and Matsu zawa 2000). Children, in turn, use their knowledge of integers up to four to generate a potentially infinite list of integers (Wynn 1992; Carey 2001; Sar necka and Carey 2008). What they recognize is that there is a rule by which they can generate two out of one, three out of two, and four out of three, and that this rule can be used to generate integers ad libitum. In other words, they can apply a successor function recursively. The mental tool of recursion is also used in human language (Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch 2002; Kanazawa 2008). From a finite number of words, humans are able to generate an infinite number of sentences. We can expand every sentence by adding a new clause to it, such as Mary thinks that.... Or, to mention an example that brings us to religious literature, we can also say things like "Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah" (Joshua 7:18; cf. below). Notice that genealogies of this kind are not arbitrary lists of names: we compile them by applying the same relationship ("son of") recursively as we add members of a new generation to them. Fractals are recursive structures that display self-similarity on any scale (even if fractals in are not always defined by recursive functions in a technical sense). In the above example, the lineage of Zerah has the same structure as the lin eage of Zabdi, and so forth, described by the rule "X son of Y." Fractals can be more complex, however. Let us take a look at the genealogy of another biblical character, Abraham (Genesis 25). Two sons of Abraham play important roles in Western religions, Ishmael and Isaac, but the text also identifies six other sons, mentioning their sons, as well. After the list of Ishmael's sons, we read about the rivalry between Isaac's twins, Jacob and Esau (Genesis 25). Esau's descendants are listed in Genesis 36, whereas the descendants of Jacob are the ancestors of the twelve tribes of Israel. Using recursion, the genealogical pas sages create a family tree, which looks the same on every scale. For example, you can look at the family of Abraham and you will see a "stem" that connects Abraham to his father Terah (Genesis 11: 27) and "branches" consisting of Abraham's many sons and their respective families. If you now move down on the family tree and pick Jacob, you will find the same pattern repeated there. Or you can move one level up and observe the same pattern with the family of Terah. Fractals are best-known in the domain of geometry. For example, the Sierpinsky triangle (Figure 1 below) consists of triangles within triangles, each of which contains a reduced-sized copy of the original structure. Snow-flakes are examples of fractal-like structures in nature. In fact, the family tree that we</page><page sequence="5">I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 Figure 1. The Sierpinski Fractal Triangle. have just described can be represented as a snow-flake, where the earliest known ancestor is situated in the middle (for example, Adam, the first human according to the Hebrew Bible), and each arm of the snow-flake stands for an offspring followed by a potentially endless number of junctions and arms. (Note that we exclude marriage between two descendents of the same individual—which can be done, for example, by focusing only on the male or female members of the lineage.) Families can be also represented as structures that resemble the Sierpinski triangle, as we will see below. Fractals have been observed in many human artifacts, as well. Both ancient Greek and Gothic buildings repeat details on increasingly smaller scales. Bach's music also dis plays self-similarity both with regard to its pitch and volume (Voss and Clarke 1975; Voss and Clarke 1978; Hsii and Hsü 1991; Shi 1996). Fractals are scale-free structures, a concept that denotes two different and interdependent features. First, fractals reveal the same structure independently of the scale on which one examines them. Second, fractals and fractal-like quantities have no typical size (or value), which would describe a large propor tion of the data. For example, body height has a typical value in populations, but it is impossible to identify a typical number of descendants in a family tree (including a large number of generations). Various features of fractal shapes and fractal-like quantities can be described by so-called "power law" functions, in which the independent variable (x) is raised to a constant power (a): f(x) = k * xa. For example, if you crumple pieces of paper, they will have a fractal</page><page sequence="6">8 /. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 structure and a power law relation can be observed between their diameter and weight (mass = k * diam2 5). In sum, recursion means that we apply the same operation to its result repeatedly, whereas fractals are structures the mental representation of which involves recursion (even if they are more diverse from the mathematical point of view). From a cognitive perspective, recursion and fractals are two aspects of the same phenomenon: humans are able to use recursion and therefore they can mentally represent fractals. In this essay, we will deal with fractal-like patterns in religion and recursive techniques that are used to generate and mentally represent them. II. Representing Boundless Qualities Using Recursion Let us start our discussion of boundless qualities by looking at a mundane example: representing the number of legs of different animals. Our different strategies for representing small and large numbers are obvious here. We can accurately represent humans having two legs and animals having four. There is some ambiguity involved in recognizing the number of legs of animals with six or eight legs—yet we can maintain fairly clear representations of them, which is helped by the symmetrical arrangement of the legs. But we do not even make an effort to represent the legs of centipedes and millipedes accu rately. The numbers here express something like "having an awful lot of legs." Nevertheless, the same relation that we recognize between having two and four legs, having four and six legs, or having six and eight legs, makes us able to represent the idea of an animal with a hundred, thousand, and even more legs, only by recursively adding legs to the imagined tail of the insect. Whereas animals that we see in reality have a finite number of legs, we could also men tally represent the idea of a mythological insect that has infinitely many. Having one thousand feet is actually known as a divine attribute in Hindu ism. The Rigveda describes the Divine Being as follows: "A thousand heads hath Purusa, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet" (Rigveda 10.90; trans. Grif fith). The word "thousand" may well be used here in the meaning of "infinitely many," as suggested by a more dynamic rendering of the passage: "That perfect Being has infinitely many heads, infinitely many eyes, infinitely many feet" (Swami Gambhirananda 2005). We can notice a similar shade of meaning in the numeral "ten thousand" in ancient Hebrew, expressed by the word fvâvâh, which is derived from the stem "great" and etymologically means a "very great multitude" (Koehler and Baumgartner 1958). In Psalm 91, for example, "thousand" and "ten thousand" are used as synonyms, suggesting that they simply mean "a great multitude":</page><page sequence="7">I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 9 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. (Psalm 91:7; trans. New Revised Standard Version) But what about the idea of infinite knowledge? There is a major difference involved in this notion as compared with heads, eyes, or feet. Up this point we have dealt only with ideas related to discrete infinity: the number of heads, eyes, or feet increases by one or its multiples. We can therefore always use recursion to represent an even greater number of them. But how can we apply recursion to the mental representation of wisdom or knowledge? It might be helpful to examine first the representation of limidess time. Various studies argue that time is represented as a non-discrete entity. The simplest way to think about time is in the form of a linear vector (Rumiati and Roncato 1985). Linguistic studies suggest that we use metaphors of space to express temporal relations (Boroditsky 2000; January and Kako 2007; Casas anto and Boroditsky 2008). Although such non-discrete representations of time are certainly significant in human thought, other research lines offer dif ferent alternatives. There are indications that the representation of time may be naturally tied up with the representation of numbers and share the same neural circuits (Roitman, Brannon, Andrews and Piatt 2007). The ability to measure time has evolved by natural selection. According to studies of optimal foraging, animals measure time to determine when they should move on to a new patch (Hills and Adler 2002). This suggests that measuring time is likely an archaic aspect of the mental representation of time. Our representation of time on a larger scale also involves measuring, based on biological and astro nomical cycles. Days, months, and years obviously have discrete numerical values, to which we can easily apply recursion. In the following passage of the Hebrew Bible we find several recursive expressions of time: Lord, you have been our dwelling place in generation and generation. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from age to age you are God. You turn us back to dust, and say, "Turn back, you mortals." For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday when it is past, or like a watch in the night. You sweep them away; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning; in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers (Psalm 90.1-5; trans. New Revised Standard Version, adapted). The first recursive structure is "in generation and generation." The succession of generations is the largest unit of time that an individual actually experiences in a lifetime. This formulation stands as a kind of shorthand for the following series: generation and generation and generation, etc. Using recursive logic, the series might be continued at will. The same structure is found in the expression "from age to age," but here recursion is applied to a unit of time</page><page sequence="8">10 I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 (age) that extends beyond what is known from everyday experience. The two expressions standing next to each other might imply that an infinite succes sion of generations makes up an "age," whereas God exists for an infinite suc cession of "ages." The next verses involve an additional level of recursion. Here the basic unit is a year. Using recursion we can then represent a thousand years. Finally we are told that for God thousand years are like a day, launching once again a recursive mental operation that generates an infinite series of days, weeks, months, and years. We can conclude that the idea of God being eternal can also be represented with the help of recursion. But still, what about infinite knowledge? I suggest that there are two differ ent ways to represent this idea. First, we can think about greater knowledge as knowing a longer list of items. Such an idea is found, for example, in the bib lical description of Solomon's wisdom: God gave Solomon very great wisdom, discernment, and breadth of understand ing as vast as the sand on the seashore. [...] He composed three thousand prov erbs, and his songs numbered a thousand and five. He would speak of trees, from the cedar that is in the Lebanon to the hyssop that grows in the wall; he would speak of animals, and birds, and reptiles, and fish. (1 Kings 4.32-33, trans. New Revised Standard Version) The memorization of lists also played an important role in Hellenistic educa tion (Morgan 1998; Czachesz 2003). Using recursion, one could imagine God as someone who knows an infinite list of items. Another way of conceptual izing infinite wisdom is to think about an infinite series of people, where each member on the list knows more than the one before him or her. For example, a child knows more than a newborn baby, an adolescent knows more than a child, an adult knows more than an adolescent, and a wise old man or woman knows even more. This kind of logic is followed in the same biblical book, where we read about Solomon that his "wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. He was wiser than anyone else, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, children of Mahol; his fame spread throughout all the surrounding nations" (1 Kings 4.30-31, trans. New Revised Standard Version). In this context we can also mention the idea found in various religious tra ditions that some state of mind characterized by a boundless quality can be achieved by gradually arriving and surpassing a number of stages. For example, Plato describes in his Symposium the path to access absolute beauty. "The can didate for this initiation cannot, if his efforts are to be rewarded, begin too early to devote himself to the beauties of the body. First of all, if his preceptor instructs him as he should, he will fall in love with the beauty of one individ ual body, so that his passion may give life to noble discourse" (Symposium 210;</page><page sequence="9">I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 11 trans. M. Joyce). Then one becomes the lover of the beauty manifested in all beautiful bodies; thereafter of the beauty of laws and institutions. "And next, his attention should be diverted from institutions to the sciences, so that he may know the beauty of every kind of knowledge [...] until he will come upon one single form of knowledge, the knowledge of the beauty I am about to speak of." Six centuries later, the Neo-Platonic philosopher Plotinus (c. 205-270) proposed that the "inner sight" should proceed from the contem plation of a "beautiful way of life" to "beautiful works," and then to the "souls of people who produce the beautiful works," because "this alone is the eye that sees the great beauty" (Enneads 1.6.9; trans. A. H. Armstrong). Buddhist sources also describe how infinity can be attained and even sur passed through progressive states of meditation (Pyysiainen 1993): Now, my friend, I have seen that the ceasing of the mental formations is gradual. When one has attained the first dhyâna [i.e., state of meditation], speech has ceased. When one has attained the second dhydna, initial and sustained thought has ceased. When one has attained the third dhydna, zest has ceased. When one has attained the fourth dhydna, inbreathing and outbreathing have ceased. When one has attained the realm of infinity of space, mental representation of objects have ceased. When one has attained the realm of infinity of cognition, mental representation of the realm of infinity of space has ceased. When one has attained the realm of nothingness, mental representation of the realm of infinity of cognition has ceased. When one has attained the realm of neither mental rep resentations nor no mental representations, mental representation of the realm of nothingness has ceased. Both mental representations and feeling have ceased when one has attained the cessation of mental representations and feeling (Samyutta IV.217, trans. Pyysiânen). Other boundless qualities are more difficult to represent. For example, it is difficult to imagine a deity that is everywhere simultaneously. In fact, many gods and supernatural agents are imagined to have a local rather than universal sphere of activity. An important reason for this limitation might be that living things normally occupy a single, bounded space. There is no living thing that can be at two, three, or more places at the same time. Consequendy we cannot use recursion to represent the notion of God being everywhere simultane ously. One way of imagining omnipresence is to use analogies from gasses and fluids. Indeed, air and water often symbolize the Holy Spirit: "The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit" (John 3:7-8). In spite of the existence of such analogies, imagining God as being everywhere seems extremely difficult. In Genesis 11, God descends to Babel (i.e., moves in space) to examine the tower that people have built and to confuse their language. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says: "Where two or</page><page sequence="10">12 I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 three are gathered in my name, I am there among them" (Matthew 18:20)—implying that he is not with them anywhere at any time. Invocation is a standard element of worship in religions, whereby God's presence is secured. Such limitations are not restricted to folk religiosity that tends to be "theologically incorrect" (cf. Barrett 1999; Slone 2004), but it is a rather gen eral trend that supernatural beings are represented as extremely mobile rather than omnipresent. This difficulty of thinking about God's omnipresence may be explained by the fact that we cannot represent this boundless quality using recursion. III. Fractals in Social Organization The number of social contacts that humans are able to maintain is limited to approximately 150 (Dunbar 1993; Dunbar 1998; Dunbar 2003; Dunbar 2004). Out of this total, we maintain especially close relationship with some five individuals: this is the "support clique," the group of people from whom "we seek advice, support, or help in times of severe emotional or financial distress" (Hill and Dunbar 2003). This size is equal to the size of grooming cliques, which function as basic coalitions in primate groups (Dunbar 1998:186). A larger group we are connected with is the "sympathy group," consisting of 12-15 people with whom we can have a deeply empathie rela tionship (Dunbar 1998:76). The next extended circle of connections includes 30 to 50 individuals, the size of "bands" or overnight camps among hunter gatherers (Dunbar 1998). The total number of social connections that we can monitor (150 relation ships) is limited by our brain capacity. Maintaining social connections is very costly; we know that from everyday life. Most importantly it requires an abil ity to monitor the network. We have to remember faces, names, birthdays, and anniversaries. In terms of the social brain hypothesis, the size of the neo cortex is a good predictor of the size of social networks that various species maintain. In fact, we might have developed large brains first of all to maintain social networks (Dunbar 1998; Dunbar and Shultz 2007; Pérez-Barbería, Shultz and Dunbar 2007; Shultz and Dunbar 2007). For a long time, however, humans have lived in societies that included more than 150 members. This is where recursion comes in. Recursion makes us able to include people we have never seen in our social networks. In the same way as we go from "support clique" to "sympathy group," from "sympa thy group" to "band," and from "band" to "village," using recursion we can extend the concept of social relations infinitely. Recursion is therefore the key</page><page sequence="11">I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 13 to organizing states and even larger social units. Let us unpack this idea in some detail. We are not only members of increasingly larger social groups but are also able to think and reason about them. In tribal societies, people can reason about their membership in a family, clan, village, or tribe. Such infor mation is frequently mentioned in ancient literary sources. For example, a recursive social structure is described at the election of Saul as the first king of Israel: [Samuel said,] "Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your clans." Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot. He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was taken by lot. Finally he brought the family of the Matrites near man by man, and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot (1 Samuel 10:19-21, trans. New Revised Standard Version). The social organization indicated here is based on kinship, which is the way Israelite society is conceived of in the Hebrew Bible.1 A more refined structure is found in another passage: So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken. He brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken; and he brought near the clan of the Zerahites, family by family, and Zabdi was taken. And he brought near his household one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken (Joshua 7:16-18, trans. New Revised Standard Version). The second text also reveals that by "family" we have to understand the extended family, which in this case includes four generations: Achan's own generation, his father Carmi's generation, his grandfather Zabdi's generation, and implicidy the generation of Achan's children. The extended family is also called a "household" (hayith), a concept that in antiquity included free adults, slaves, and children. It is difficult to judge the number of people that are meant to be included in the extended family, but we can venture the hypoth esis that it is in the order of 150, the size of the social network that we can monitor. We may also attempt to interpret the units below the level of the extended family in terms of the social network model presented above. Sym pathy group, consisting of 12-15 members, might include the immediate household, consisting of parents, children, and slaves. If we move one level up, we can add grandparents, cousins, uncles and aunts (also aged relatives and widows), making a "band" of 30-50 individuals. It is not easy to find an equiv alent of the smallest unit, that is, the "support clique," which includes only 1 Note that we are now dealing with reasoning about social organization and not the structure of any actual society in history.</page><page sequence="12">14 I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 some members of the immediate household (and even only some of its free members). This tension between the smallest social unit in cognitive terms (that is, the support clique), on the one hand, and the minimal social unit of ancient (Israelite) society (that is, the household) might be an important factor in sibling rivalry, a recurrent theme in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Genesis 4:1-16; 25:19-34; 37). In any case, social cognition as reflected in these sources uses recursion to split large social formations into subsequent levels of organi zation with self-similar structure, depicting society as a fractal. Somewhere in the middle of the hierarchy we find the maximum group size predicted by our brain capacities. Recursion is used to model the relations among both lower and higher levels of organization. Our example mentions three levels within the extended family (Achan, Carmi, Zabdi) as well as three higher levels of organization (Zerahites, Juda, Israel), which might not be acci dental. We can speculate that it is the structure of our immediately perceivable social environment that provides analogies for modeling higher-lever relation ships. We can further hypothesize that the number of units at each level is limited by the capacity of our working memory. In this way, the structure of social networks, the maximum number of group members (as predicted by the size of the neocortex), and the limit of the working memory form three inter connected variables. Sets of values of these variables might reflect different solutions to balance social cognition and resource management. In other words, we can add working memory to the social brain hypothesis: the maxi mum size of our direct social network is defined by our brain size, which in turn depends on the energy we can draw from our environment (Aiello and Wheeler 1995; Gibbons 1998; Hladik, Chivers and Pasquet 1999). How well fed we are, however, does not directly follow from the group size, but rather from the group size and the structure of the group. The manageable group structure, in turn, depends on recursion and the size of working memory, the latter limiting the number of units at each recursive level as well as the number of levels we can actually manipulate. This also explains that even though the basic social unit of ancient society might equal to the sympathy group of 12-15 members, this unit is further split up into "support cliques" due to the limitations of the working memory. An exhaustive analysis of the recursive structure of the cognitive model of social networks would include cognitive, biological, ecological, and socio-economic factors that cannot be discussed in more detail at this point. I thus propose that the ability to reason about larger social networks emerged as a bonus feature of our brain structures serving basic social organization (cf. Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch 2002). Once we have learned to use recursion to model multi-level group structure, we can use recursion to extend this model</page><page sequence="13">I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 15 to any number of levels. At this point we will have to deal with social networks where we cannot maintain exact representations of every individual. We need another tool to think about individuals belonging to social groups to which we are connected at higher recursive levels: stereotyping. The use of stereotypes is a huge area of social theory (Kunda 1999; Operario and Fiske 2004). We maintain stereotypes even in connection with people whom we know well, but we especially need stereotypes when interacting with people about whom we know litde. Reasoning about large social structures, however, is not neces sarily tied up with the use of stereotypes. Instead of relying on stereotypes, we can think about whole groups as agents, who do, desire, or regret something. When the Hebrew Bible mentions "Israel" (the highest recursive level of social organization in our example), it does not refer to the sum of Israelite people. Similarly, when we speak about the Finnish people or the Dutch we do not have a stereotyped version of Finnish or Dutch individuals in mind. Instead, we think about "the Finns," "the Dutch," or "Israel" as autonomous agents. Thinking about large social entities, distant groups, or foreign nations thus involves recursion, stereotypes, and agentive reasoning. We are using recursive logic to generate ideas of such social entities, stereotypes to think about indi viduals belonging to them, and agentive reasoning to think about their behav ior. The use of these strategies has further implications. First, instead of applying agentive reasoning to a higher-level social entity as a group (e.g., "the Finns") it is also possible just to think about an agent without an explicit refer ence to the underlying notion of a group. In our example, at least the names of Zerah, Juda, and Israel (that is, the patriarch Jacob, see Genesis 32:28) are mentioned in this latter sense. Second, we are using knowledge about lower lever social networks to think about higher levels. For example, ancients thought about empires as households, about the emperor as a father, and about all humankind in terms of brotherhood. Finally, ideas about higher level social structures and other distant agents are often shared by many people and are governed by stereotypes. I suggest that the above-mentioned strategies of conceptualizing about higher-level social organization are used to reason about supernatural agents (Czachesz 2007d). For most of human history, higher-level social organization functioned without most people ever seeing the monarch, the allies, or the enemy. Figures such as "Israel" or the "Emperor" were especially important in thinking about society. In Medieval English political theory, the king had a private and a political body, the latter consisting of the king's subjects (Kan torowicz 1957; cf. Pyysiáinen 2009). We also have good reasons to think that many religious agents came to being as long-standing, stabilized, stereotyped, and socially transmitted images of distant or abstract social agents. Making</page><page sequence="14">16 I. Czachesz I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 such a link is supported by the observation that religious agents are often important family members, rulers, or distant, exotic people. The religious cults related to ancestors, heroes, and kings provide ample evidence for the first two categories. Examples of the third type of religious agents are demons in antiquity that looked like Ethiopians (Czachesz 2012:61); the Neo Babylonian empire (Revelation 16-19) and the people of Gog and Magog (Revelation 20) that represented the forces of Satan in early Christianity (the latter also appearing in a similar role in Quran 21:96-97 and other religious traditions); or the role of Europeans in the mythology of the Micronesian and Melanesian cargo-cults (Whitehouse 1995). Recursive reasoning about extended social networks thus seems to be an important source of the concept of supernatural agents. If this is true, we can speak about at least two different types of supernatural agents: hypersensitive agent detection (Guthrie 1993; Barrett 2004), imaginary companions (Taylor 1999; Hoff2003; Hoff 2005a; Hoff 2005b), and possible innate intuitions about the dead (see above) gener ate ideas about spirit-like beings, whereas reasoning about extended social net works generates ideas of heroes, gods, and various legendary figures. There are shared (e.g., theory of mind, agentive reasoning) as well as distinct (e.g., folk physics, recursion) mechanisms underlying these two types of ideas about supernatural agents. IV. Ritualized Behavior Recursion may also underlie some forms of ritualized behavior. In the 1940s, Skinner put a hungry pigeon in a cage equipped with an automatic feeder (Skinner 1948; Morse and Skinner 1957). A clock was set to give the bird access to the food for five seconds in regular intervals. Instead of just waiting for the next appearance of the food, most of the birds started to perform vari ous kinds of repetitive behaviors. Skinner called this behavior superstitious con ditioning. He suggested that superstitious conditioning developed because the birds happened to execute some movement just as the food appeared, and as a result they repeated it. If they subsequently received food before a not too long interval, the response was strengthened further. Skinner suggested that the behavior he observed with pigeons is analogous to the mechanism of some human superstitions, such as rituals performed to change one's luck with cards or movements of the arm after a bowler released the ball. Skinners suggestions about human analogies inspired further experimenta tion (Vyse 1997). In the late 1980s, G. A. Wagner and E. K. Morris (1987) designed a mechanical clown, Bobo, that dispensed a marble from its mouth</page><page sequence="15">I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 17 at regular intervals. Hiey told preschool children they would receive a toy (that they received anyway) if they collect enough marbles in an eight-minute ses sion. The session was repeated once a day for six days. Children developed responses similar to those of Skinner's pigeons: they grimaced before Bobo, touched its face, wriggled, smiled at him, or kissed his nose. Koichi Ono (1987) experimented with Japanese university students. The students were asked to take seat in a booth that was equipped with a counter, a signal lamp (with three colors), and three levers. They were not required to do anything specific but were told they may earn scores on the counter if they do some thing. Scores appeared on the counter either at regular or random intervals, but without any consistence with the light signals and anything students did. Three of the twenty students developed "superstitious behavior." The most spectacular was the behavior of a female student: About 5 min into the session, a point delivery occurred after she had stopped pulling the lever temporarily and had put her right hand on the lever frame. This behaviour was followed by a point delivery, after which she climbed on the table and put her right hand to the counter. Just as she did so, another point was deliv ered. Thereafter she began to touch many things in turn, such as the signal light, the screen, a nail on the screen, and the wall. About 10 min later, a point was delivered just as she jumped to the floor, and touching was replaced by jumping. After five jumps, a point was delivered when she jumped and touched the ceiling with her slipper in her hand. Jumping to touch the ceiling continued repeatedly and was followed by points until she stopped about 25 min into the session, per haps because of fatigue (Ono 1987). The development of superstitious conditioning is influenced by a number of different factors. (1) First, substance use seems to be an important factor. Recent experiments by Tom P. Freeman and colleagues (2009) have shown that the development of superstitious conditioning can be enhanced by the use of ketamine, a substance that blocks certain neuroreceptors and is used in anesthetics and other drugs. Chronic (but not acute) exposure to ketamine increased subjects' propensity to adopt superstitious conditioning, which falls in line with previous findings about the repeated use of ketamine contributing to delusionary thinking. If we apply these findings to religious rituals, we can hypothesize that the use of certain substances can increase the likelihood that people acquire ritualized behavior in response to recurrent environmental stimuli. (2) Second, differences between positive and negative stimuli as well as between single and concomitant reinforcement schedules have been exam ined. Most experiments on superstitious conditioning examined the effect of positive or "appetitive" reinforces (that is, desirable environmental stimuli); little attention has been paid to the effect of negative reinforcers (that is,</page><page sequence="16">18 I. Czachesz I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 aversive stimuli that subjects try to remove). C. M. Bloom and colleagues (2007) examined the effect of both negative stimuli (trying to remove the word "BAD" from the screen by experimenting with different keystrokes) and positive stimuli (trying to make the word "GOOD" appear on the screen using the same methods). They also combined these stimuli with avoidance, that is, the task of trying to prevent the negative stimulus from appearing on the screen or trying to keep the positive stimulus from disappearing. They found that negative and positive stimuli were equally efficient in eliciting superstitious conditioning. Concomitant schedules, where the positive or nega tive stimulus was combined with avoidance, were more successfid, and the negative concomitant schedule had a further advantage over its positive equiv alent. The particular efficiency of a combination of negative reinforcement and avoidance in bringing about superstitious conditioning is not surprising in light of the results of previous research on fear conditioning (Ohman and Mineka 2001). According to Pascal Boyer and Pierre Liénard (2006) there is an evolved precaution system in the human mind that underlies ritualized behavior. In sum, scholars have independently arrived at similar conclusions about a strong link between avoidance and ritualized behavior, the nature of which has to be further explored in future. For the time being, we can con clude that recurrent patterns of stimuli are particularly efficient in eliciting superstitious conditioning if the stimuli are aversive and reinforcement is combined with avoidance. (3) Third, previous studies on reinforcement schedules in operant condi tioning suggest that the temporal distribution of the stimuli is an important factor that influences the development and persistence of conditioned behav ior. Superstitious conditioning is a special case of the elementary learning mechanism of operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the animal learns about the relationship of a stimulus and the animal's own behavior (Skinner 1938; Schwartz, Wasserman and Robbins 2002). Whereas in most cases the animal's behavior actually effects the occurrence of the stimulus (for example, pressing a lever results in the delivery of food), in superstitious conditioning no such link exists (for example, Bobo dispensed marbles independently of what children did). The influence of the temporal distribution of the stimuli on conditioned behavior was thoroughly studied in operant conditioning (Ferster and Skinner 1957; Schwartz, Wasserman and Robbins 2002). It is interesting to examine which reinforcement schedules result in the strongest conditioning. One might expect that this is monotonous, invariable reinforce ment. In fact, the opposite is true: continuous reinforcement leads to the low est rate of responding, whereas the variable ratio schedule to the fastest rates of responding. Variable ratio means that every nth. (e.g., fifth or tenth) response</page><page sequence="17">I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 19 is rewarded on the average, but the gap between two rewards can be very short or very large. Whereas experiments on superstitious conditioning manipulated reinforce ment intervals and applied random reinforcement, no experimentation has been dedicated to schedules with more sophisticated temporal distributions in superstitious conditioning. We can, however, make some observations about the temporal distribution of some reinforcement schedules that occur in real life and seem to be connected to ritualized behavior. To begin with, the vari able ratio schedule occurs in many real-life situations, such as fishing and gambling, which might be an important factor in people getting so easily addicted to these activities (Eysenck 2004: 267). In some respect, fishing and gambling might seem to be two very different behaviors. The success of fishing depends on knowledge and experience, whereas success in gambling typically does not depend on experience. Independently of the level of the fisher's expertise, however, the reinforcement schedule of fishing will retain the same variable ratio (external circumstances such as location or climate being equal): every wth attempt will be successful on the average, but intervals between two catches will vary. In both cases, response will have an effect on the occurrence of the stimulus: there is no catch without fishing, and no winning without gambling. In both cases, we can speak of operant conditioning, but not about superstitious conditioning (although superstitious conditioning might accom pany both behaviors). A closer look at the reinforcement schedule of some forms of gambling reveals remarkable connections with fractal-like patterns of probability. Gron ingen born mathematician Daniel Bernoulli analyzed the following game (Bernoulli 1738; Bernoulli 1954; Dehling 1997; Liebovitch and Scheurle 2000; Csermely 2006: 25-26). You toss a coin until it lands heads. If it lands heads on the first toss, you win two ducats. If it lands tails on the first toss and then heads on the second toss, you win four ducats. If it lands tails twice and then heads on the third toss, you win eight ducats, and so on, the return dou bling each time. What is the probability of gaining a certain amount in this game? The probability for the coin to land heads or tails on each toss indepen dendy is 1/2 and that is exacdy the chance of winning two ducats. In order to win four ducats, however, you have to be lucky again after having luck with the first toss: therefore the probability of winning four ducats is only 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. By the same logic, the chance of winning eight ducats is 1/8. Consequendy, there is a high probability of winning a small amount of money, medium probability of winning a larger amount of money, and a very small probability of winning a huge jackpot. These frequent small values, moder ately often medium values, and infrequent large values are analogous to the</page><page sequence="18">20 I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 many tiny pieces, some medium-sized pieces, and the few large pieces in a fractal object. The probability distribution of the return is scale-free (just like the structure of fractals) and has no typical value (technically speaking, it shows a power-law relation discussed above). Similar distributions of divi dends have been found recently in various horse races (Park and Domany 2001; Ichinomiya 2006). It is typical for gambling and different other games that include an element of chance that high returns occur with much less probability (frequency) than low returns, although the exact distribution of probabilities can be different across different games. People can play games for several reasons, and typical motivations to play vary from game to game and from person to person. On the whole, however, we can observe that playing games is often highly ritualized. Reinforcement schedules apparently play an important role in the development of ritualization, and the fractal-like distri bution of returns can strengthen this effect. Rainmaking is a pure form of superstitious conditioning: rain will or will not fall independently of rainmaking rituals. Rainmaking is a universally known ritual behavior that occurs even in developed countries (Frazer 1911, Ch. 5; Bownas 1963; Dunnigan 2005; Boudon 2006). In Greco-Roman antiquity, the official and private practice of rainmaking is attested since archaic times and continues beyond the Christianization of the Empire (Graf 2005:298). According Tertullian (ca. 160-ca. 220), Christians were able to obtain rain through prayer (Apology 5). Rainfall obviously follows a variable schedule: therefore we may think about a rainmaking ritual as a response to a variable reinforcer: a rainmaking ritual that is accidentally followed by rain may motivate the repeated use of the ritual, launching a chain of ritual responses to the variable reinforcement schedule of rainfall. A closer look at the schedule of rain also reveals that both the time intervals and the amount of rainfall are have a scale-free distribution (Peters and Christensen 2002; Peters and Christensen 2006), which is similar to the coin-flipping game dis cussed above. For scientists, this observation provides important information about the physical processes behind rainfall. From the point of view of rituals, it is quite interesting that one of the most archaic and widely attested rituals can be understood as a conditioned response to a reinforcer that has a fractal like distribution in terms of both time intervals and intensity. Comparing the development of superstitious conditioning in humans and animals can reveal further interesting features of ritual behavior. First, recent scholarship questioned Skinners interpretation of the pigeon's behav ior. The "superstitious" behavior of the pigeon (and of other animals) has been more convincingly identified as preparation for feeding (actually increasing foraging efficacy), just like the salivation of Pavlov's dog (Moore 2004). Although functionalist explanations of human superstitions can be constructed,</page><page sequence="19">I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 21 it is hard to explain students' point-collecting behavior or rainmaking rituals in such a way. Second, two types of "superstitious" behavior have been explained as evolutionary adaptations (Foster and Kokko 2009): (1) "supersti tious" response to a stimulus, where the response has great adaptive value, although it is only weakly connected to the stimulus (for example, hypersensi tive agent detection) and (2) false association between two stimuli, which are never causally linked, but discriminating between them would be too costly (such as two slightly different sounds signaling a predator). Again, the human examples of ritualized behavior that we analyzed do not display either of these patterns. It appears that their more complex cognitive abilities make humans prone to more purely superstitious rituals, in which the mental representation of recursive, fractal-like patterns of stimuli could play a role. V. Conclusion After reviewing the presence of recursion, fractals, and fractal-like structures (such as scale-free distribution) in three different domains of religious thought and behavior, we can ask how far these observations support the hypothesis of a human Faculty of Religion in the Narrow Sense. Hie cognitive science of religion has traditionally rejected "magic bullet" explanations of religion (Boyer 2001: 50; Whitehouse 2012) and suggested that religion depends on various factors and human religious thought and behavior do not have a sin gular underlying cause. Accordingly, functionalist explanations of religion have been typically rejected by the cognitive approach. How does the concept of a human faculty of religion fit into that picture? In recent cognitive theoriz ing, functionalist explanations have made a return (e.g., Bering and Johnson 2005; Johnson and Bering 2009; Bulbulia 2004; Bulbulia 2007). Is it neces sary to identify a function of religion in order to justify the concept of FRN? I suggest that FRN does not depend on finding an adaptive function of religion. Moreover, the dilemma of adaptive versus byproduct explanations seems misguided in the case of religion, which is a highly complex cognitive and cultural phenomenon. As Ilkka Pyysiàinen and Marc Hauser argued recently (Pyysiàinen and Hauser 2010), some components of religion might be adaptive and others byproducts. Further, we can add that it could change during human evolution which components belonged to which category: evo lution is famously known to be a "tinkerer." Elementary forms of religion could be very early in human evolution: we can expect several mental struc tures underlying human religiosity to occur (in some form) in other species, as well, including hypersensitive agent-detection, Theory of Mind (Hare, Call, Agnetta and Tomasello 2000; Horowitz 2007), innate onto logical categories</page><page sequence="20">22 I. Czachesz / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 3-28 (e.g., expecting plants to behave differently from animals), or superstitious conditioning. These cognitive abilities constitute the Faculty of Religion in a Broad Sense (FRB). The use of recursion was made possible by an increase in the size of the working memory of early humans (Read 2006) and its use could extend to different components of religion gradually. Recognizing fractals and fractal like patterns in stimuli (unconsciously) and developing ritualized responses to them could be an early development. The idea of morally interested gods needs a basic understanding of recursive structures (cf. Bering and Johnson 2005). Such god ideas imply second and higher orders of Theory of Mind, that is, reasoning about what X thinks of Y thinks of Z etc., and could provide an impetus to integrate recursive patterns into religion. The formation of large-scale societies could give rise, in terms of our discussion, to beliefs in transcendent (more properly, distant) gods. Concepts of boundless qualities could develop as a next step: eternal existence and omniscience can be repre sented using recursion, whereas omnipresence seems a more difficult concept that is not easily mastered even by expert theologians. It has to be noted that there are strong indications that large-scale societies were formed early enough so that they could influence human evolution (Richerson and Boyd 2004). Elements of religion could be adapted, for example, as symbolic markers that supported complex social organization and group identity beyond face-to-face interaction (ibid.; Czachesz 201 lb). It is thus possible that evolutionary adap tions to culturally maintained (and partly functional) religious behaviors occurred during this time, for example by the mechanism of cognitive ratchet ing (Deacon 1997) or by genetic assimilation (Jablonka and Lamb 2005). Even though omniscient gods are not equally important in all human cultures and people often make mistakes when they have to use the concept intuitively, it seems that the idea can be acquired without difficulty by people from all cultures (suggested, for example, by the success of Western religions). Future work can shed more light on the exact scope and developmental path of FRN and on the question of how it is drawn upon by different religious traditions of the world.
