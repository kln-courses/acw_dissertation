ALLEN, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York I. INTRODUCTION THE connection between the great storm, flooding, and destruction described in the Ahmose Tempest Stela and the Late Bronze Age eruption of the volcano on the island of Thera in the Cyclades as proposed by C. Vandersleyen, H. Goedicke, E. N. Davis, and, most recently, K. P. Foster and R. K. Ritner' is the subject of this paper. If established, such a connection would have a profound impact on the chronology of the Aegean world, the na- ture of the interconnections at various times between the Aegean and Egypt, and the cred- ibility of dendro-vulcanologic dating, among other issues.2 We believe that the purported connection is not supported by the evidence. Rather, we believe the description is in- consistent with what is known about the earthquake and following eruption at Thera, con- sistent with the nature of monsoon-generated Nile floods, and characteristic of a genre of texts describing the restoration of order by rulers. A retranslation and explication of the text by James P. Allen is followed by Malcolm H. Wiener's discussion of the Theran earthquakes and eruption and of the context of the Stela. II. THE TEMPEST STELA OF AHMOSE James P. Allen The text in question exists on fragments of a stela once erected by the pharaoh Ah- mose in the temple of Karnak. It was initially published by C. Vandersleyen and subse- quently republished by W. Helck with emendations and additional suggested restorations.3 1 C.

Lacau,4 and Helck's was based in turn on Vandersleyen's articles. Given the critical nature of some of the lacunae and partially preserved areas on the stela, a firsthand examination is clearly needed; lacking the opportunity for that, however, I too have had to rely on the published photographs and on Lacau's readings. Approximately a quarter of the original text has been lost. Fortunately, the text was in- scribed in two nearly identical versions, one on either side of the stela, and this has made it possible to recover a continuous narrative in the last half of the inscription. The first half, however, is less clear. The lacunae are larger, the context of the preserved text is not always evident, and in one case (6 F, 7 B) even the length of the lacuna itself is uncertain. Moreover, although the text of both sides is the same, the inscription on the face occupies only eighteen lines, to twenty-one on the back. As a result, the spacing and sometimes also the orthography of the two versions are different-a characteristic that must be taken into account in judging the value of the restorations that Vandersleyen and Helck have pro- posed for those sections where no text has survived, since any text that fills a lacuna on one side must also do so on the other. Finally, although Vandersleyen's publication con- tains both photographs and drawings of the inscription on both sides, the crucial upper- most fragment of the stela has not been published in a way that allows its relationship to the rest of the stela-and, therefore, the length of the lacunae adjacent to it-to be judged accurately.5 For these reasons, reexamination of the stela's text required a fresh approach to the physical document itself, insofar as this is available from the publications. Fortunately, the carefully recorded measurements in Vandersleyen's publication (both actual and estimated), combined with contemporary technology, make such an undertaking feasible. The pub- lished photographs were scanned into computer images at high resolution, corrected for distortion and angle insofar as possible,6 and scaled at one to ten (based on published mea- surements). The two unattached fragments were then placed in their proper position on the overall photographs; scanned images of Vandersleyen's drawings were used as an aid to and check against the placement. The final composite images served as templates for the two new drawings of the reconstructed stela reproduced in figs. la and lb here.7 The gigyptische Texte (Wiesbaden, 1975), pp. 104-10. The fragments in Vandersleyen's second article were first published, in photograph, by Abdul-Qader Muhammad, "Recent Finds," ASAE 59 (1966): 148-49, pl. 5. Two other studies have relied essentially on Vandersleyen's translation: Davis, "A Storm in Egypt" and S. W. Man- ning, The Absolute Chronology of the Aegean Early Bronze Age (Sheffield, 1995), pp. 200-216. 4 Vandersleyen, "Temp~te," pp. 123; "Fragments," pp. 127-28. 5 Vandersleyen, "Fragments," figs. 1-2, shows a drawing of this fragment joined to the uppermost one ("a") of the overall photographs and drawings pub- lished in "Tempete," pls. 8-9 and 8A-9A. The arrange- ment of signs in Fragment "a," however, is slightly different in the two drawings. No photograph of Frag- ment "a" has been published. 6 The two faces in the photographs published by Vandersleyen, "Tempfte," pls. 8-9, are relatively square to the camera, but the top is slightly farther from the camera than the bottom. The photographs of the frag- ments published by Abdul-Qader Muhammad, "Recent Finds," pl. 5, are both tilted horizontally and were shot at an angle so that one side is farther from the camera than the other. 7 The reconstructed shape of the stela above the highest preserved fragment is conjectural; the overall height is based on Vandersleyen's estimate ("Frag- ments," p. 127). The scene above the text on both sides was drawn from the photograph, as was the general physical outline of the fragments. The column lines and hieroglyphs of the text were placed directly over their originals on the photographs, but both have been "regularized," since they were intended only to gauge the size of lacunae and restored text and not as an accurate paleographic reproduction. The drawing and hieroglyphs were produced using commercial software (CorelDraw) and a font developed by the Metropolitan</page><page sequence="3">THE AHMOSE TEMPEST STELA AND THE THERAN ERUPTION 3 primary benefit of these reconstructions has been to provide a more accurate measure of the length of existing lacunae and the feasibility of proposed readings and textual resto- rations.

Ahmose's Restoration of the Temples (11. 14-18 F, 16-21 B) What His Incarnation did was to rest in the Palace, iph. Then one was reminding His Incarnation of the entering of the sacred estates, the dismantling of tombs, the hacking up of mortuary enclosures, and the toppling of pyramids-how what had never been done (before) had been done. Then His Incarnation commanded to make firm the temples that had fallen to ruin in this entire land: to make functional the monuments of the gods, to erect their enclosure walls, to put the sacred things in the special room, to hide the secret places, to cause the processional images that were fallen to the ground to enter their shrines, to set up the braziers, to erect the altars and fix their offering-loaves, to double the income of office-holders-to put the land like its original situation. Then it was done like every- thing that His Incarnation commanded to do. NOTES TO THE TRANSLATION [hsbt 1 ... hr hm n] (11. 0-1) As Vandersleyen noted ("Fragments," p. 129), the centerline of the scene at the top of the stela on both sides is offset to the left of the central axis of the stela itself. Judging from the scene on the face, the amount of the offset is approximately 5.2 cm-too narrow for an anthropomorphic figure but equivalent to the normal height of a line of a text on the stela. This suggests the existence of a column of text at the left (here numbered 0 to preserve the line numbering of Vandersleyen and Helck), which may have contained the date of the inscription: see Vandersleyen, "Tempte," p. 150; see also the last note to line 1, below. For the date, see Vandersleyen, "Fragments," p. 132, and the first note to line 2, below. [ Chrw C Oprw nb]tj (1. 1) As Helck saw, the spacing on the back requires a horizontal cJ sign; the more limited space on the face probably accommodated the same sign vertically. s[t] r.f jwt hm.f (1. 1) If the traces that Vandersleyen noted "se laissent d6duire stirement... en avant et au-dessus du f" in 1. 1 F ("Fragments," p. 131) are in fact those of a vertical s and an r sign (the fragment has been published only in line drawing), this seems to be the only possible restoration, although the text elsewhere consistently uses the spelling jst and not st. If the traces are not as Vandersleyen sup- posed, the only other possibility would appear to be [h]f[t], with Vandersleyen's vertical s probably the tail of the d-snake of dt and the presumed r of the f-snake simply a break. The preposition hft is somewhat better suited to the infinitive jwt (see W. Helck, Texte der 2. Zwischenzeit, p. 144): st/ jst (r.f) tends to be followed by the sdm.n.f subject plus stative, or subject hr sdm (E von Bissing, "Grammatische Studien zu Inschriften der XVIIIten Dynastie," Recueil de travaux [RT] 19 [1897]: 187-93). The use of st/jst (r.f) at the beginning of a narrative seems to occur only after an initial statement or a date: for example, P. Vernus, "Litt6rature et autobiographie: Les inscriptions de S3-Mwt surnomm6 Kyky," RdE 30 (1978): 120; Urk. IV, 689, 3-4. The latter may have existed in a column of text at the left of the stela's scene: see the first note above.</page><page sequence="7">THE AHMOSE TEMPEST STELA AND THE THERAN ERUPTION 7 jwt hm.f [...] (11. 1-2) The gap from hm.f to the determinative of rC on the face is about 5 + 7 groups; on the back, the number of groups lost between dt and the first preserved sign in line 2 is the same (7? + 5). A similar amount of text has thus been lost on both faces: about 7? groups, from hm.f to [dh]n.n. The few words these contained probably denoted the destination and perhaps also the purpose of the king's visit. The destination was either Thebes or, more specifically, the temple of Amun at Karnak, where the stela was undoubtedly erected (r-pr pn, "this temple": 11. 5 F, 6 B). [dh]n.n sw rC r nswt ds.f (1. 2) This clause was probably dependent on the preceding one (jwt hm.f [.. .]), with the sdm.n.f de- noting prior circumstance either in itself or after m ht (for the latter, see Gardiner, EG, ?156). The wording suggests that the king's visit to Karnak took place shortly after his accession, in his first regnal year. jst grt hims.n hIIm.f m dmj n sdJf(3)-t3wj [.. .] nt rswjntjst r.fj[mn-rc nb nswt tiwj] mjnw smC (11.2-3) These two clauses provide the rationale for the king's journey to Thebes. The first refers to a place in which the king "had settled" (Wb. III, 97 Iv; 98, 11): since hmsj (m) is intransitive, the use of the sdm.n.f here instead of the stative must be meant to denote an action rather than an ongoing state. The text locates the king's residence "south of Dendera" (rsw jnt)-perhaps, as Vandersleyen sug- gested ("Tempte," pp. 151-53), in one of the palaces at Ballas. The lacuna between sdJf(3)-t3wj and nt rswjnt probably contained a phrase linking the two place-names, although Helck's suggested [m ww n tpj] is questionable. The lacuna on the face can only have been about two groups wide: the lacuna at the beginning of line 3 F cannot have contained more than 3 B's jst r.fj[mn-rc nb nswt t3wj] m jnw (more tightly spaced), which places 1. 3 B's nt rswjnt at the end of 1. 2 F; the stroke before 1. 3 B's nt also appears to be too close to the n to have accommodated Helck's suggested tp above it. Helck's restoration of the name and epithet of Amun in the second clause is highly probable, since it suits both the available spacing in 1. 3 B and the context. The two clauses, together with the mention of the king's "designation" in 1. 2, suggest that Ahmose had been crowned outside Thebes, perhaps at his residence in Ballas. In that case, he would have had an obligation as one of his first official duties to visit Karnak, where his coronation could be confirmed by Amun-Re, "lord of thrones of the Two Lands." (wn).jn hm.f fnt r r[dit n.f . . .] web (11. 3 F, 3-4 B) The lacuna between imC in 1. 3 B and [web] in 1. 4 B is about 13? groups long; the corresponding portion in 1. 3 F contains slightly more than 8 groups, with 5 of these occupied by the preserved text jn hm.f hnt r r[dit]. Even with more generous spacing, the difference of 5? groups on the back seems too large to have held only the 3 groups missing between r r[dit] and web on the face. Since the "participial statement" of 1. 3 F also seems unmotivated in the context, the lacuna on the back may have contained the additional group wn of an introductory wn.jn, "then," which was omitted on the face. The lost text between r r[dit] and web probably contained a dative n.f, "to him" (referring to Amun); the remainder of 2 (face) to 4 (back) groups indicates that only a single noun-phrase has been lost before web: probably one synonymous with C3[bt], "offering" (see next entry). r m it t3 C3[bt. . . s]n (11. 3-4 F, 4 B) The demonstrative apparently refers to the expression [...] web in the preceding sentence. Some 9? groups have been lost after c[bt] on the face and 12? on the back. Since the next lines mention</page><page sequence="8">8 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES the reentry of Amun's "processional image" into the temple (see the next two notes), the lacuna may have contained a description of how the image was taken out in procession "after this offering- ceremony." The signs after the lacuna can be restored as part of the suffix or dependent pronoun [s]n; if so, a plural antecedent of some sort has been lost in the lacuna, perhaps referring to the im- ages of other gods. hr di.tw hr m[.. .] pn (11. 4 F, 5 B) Ritner's translation "then attention was given in" ("Thera Eruption," p. 11) is based on the idiom rdj hr, "pay attention," but this is normally construed with r, n, or hr(Wb. III, 126 Iv). Vandersleyen's "on mettra sur" ("Fragments," p. 131) is thus preferable: hr is the preposition, and the m following is the first sign of its nominal object m[. . .]. The verb's subject is unexpressed and was probably men- tioned in the preceding lacuna; for br sdm.f in a narrative context, see Urk. IV, 690. 5. The lacuna of 4? groups before pn on both faces contained the nominal object of hr at its beginning and a sec- ond noun such as ww, "district" at its end (determinatives preserved before pn), with a preposition or genitive linking the two nouns. The sentence as a whole may have described where the images of the gods were put in the course of or after the procession. jst grt sim [. . .], hCwf hnm m r-pr pn, Cwt.f h r rw[t] (11. 4-6 F, 5-7 B) These clauses evidently refer to the "processional image" (sim) of Amun. The initial jst grt sug- gests a contrast with the preceding clauses, which may then have dealt with the images of the other gods. The clause hcw.f hnm m r-pr pn, "his body united with this temple" probably describes the god's entry into Karnak (Wb. III, 380, 17), which suggests that the lacuna in 11. 3-4 F and 4 B referred to the god's emergence in procession from the temple "after this offering-ceremony." The lacuna after sim contained 12 + 6 groups on the back and 5 + 13? on the face (with some 5 at the end of the latter occupied by hcw.f hnm). Since the text after the second lacuna begins with a nominal subject (sig- naling a new sentence) most of that gap probably contained either a third circumstantial clause or an unrelated statement-probably the latter (see the next note). The gap from pn in 1. 6 B to the ntr sign that probably preceded the divine determinative in 1. 7 B contained 13 + 52 groups; with some 42-5 groups needed for 1. 5 F's Cwt.fhr rsw[t], this leaves a lacuna of 132-14 groups. The lacuna at the end of 1. 7 B, after ibyt, is 13 groups long, of which the last 10 to 11 (depending on spacing) were occupied by the text preserved in 1. 6 F (92 groups), leaving a gap of perhaps 2 groups between Tbyt and the quail-chick before hm.f In 11. 5-6 F, the lacuna from rlw[t] to the quail-chick is 6? + 13 groups long. Line 7 B's [ntr] pn CD hr Tbyt takes up 9? groups, with perhaps another 2 from 3byt to the quail-chick. If the spacing and arrangement of this text were the same on the face, this would leave only about 8 groups from rSw[t] to [ntr]. Since 11. 6-7 B had 14 groups for the same lacuna, the orthography of [ntr] pn c3 hr %byt must have been more abbreviated on the face than it is on the back. This text could have been accommodated in about 6 groups if the signs were more tightly spaced (as usual on the face), if c3 occupied only a single group and if the infinitive after hr were written without the double reed-leaf (3bt). This reduction would leave about 3? additional groups free for the lacuna from r'iw[t] to [ntr], providing a total of 11 groups to the 14 on the face-a ratio of 1:1.22, only slightly tighter than the overall ratio of 1:1.17 between the face (18 lines) and the back (21 lines). [wn.jn hm.f d r hnw pr-C Cnh (w)d? s(nb), jst grt ntr] pn c3 hr byt [...] (11. 5-6 F, 6-7 B) About 2 groups have been lost between Tbyt and the quail-chick before hm.f which certainly con- tained the object of the infinitive. Two interpretations of the surviving words are possible: as one or two clauses. In the first case, [ntr] pn c3 will have belonged to one clause, with hr 3byt [...] a sep-</page><page sequence="9">THE AHMOSE TEMPEST STELA AND THE THERAN ERUPTION 9 arate circumstantial clause: for example, "[His Incarnation went before] this great [god], desiring [...]." In the second, only one clause is involved, with [ntr] pn C3 the subject of a "pseudoverbal" predicate hr %byt: "this great [god] was desiring [. . .]." Vandersleyen ("Tempte," p. 131) opted for the second interpretation, in which he has been followed by Ritner ("Thera Eruption," p. 11). Since the text in 11. 12 F and 14 B notes that the god "received what he had desired" (3b(t).n.f), this anal- ysis is in fact the more plausible; the nominal subject probably marks a new sentence. The lacuna preceding [ntr] pn c3 undoubtedly contained a separate clause. Although this could have been a third circumstantial description of the god's satisfaction (following Cwt.f hr riw[t]), a separate statement noting the king's return northward from Thebes is more likely, since it seems called for by the sub- sequent mention of the king's journey by boat to "the interior of Thebes" (11. 10-12 F, 12-14 B). In either case, the clause that emerges from the lacuna in 1. 7 B was probably introduced by a particle of some sort before [ntr] pn CD: since the preceding clauses describe the god's satisfaction, this clause evidently refers to a further "desire" of his; the contrastive [jst grt] suggested by Helck thus seems likely. The remainder of the lacuna can be filled by the restoration suggested here or a similar statement of the king's return home. For the object of ibyt, see the next note. Uist grt ntr] pn c3 hr 3byt [Cn s]w hm.f [rr.f] (11. 6 F, 7 B) The text contained perhaps 2 groups in the lacuna 3byt [.. .] w hm.f (see preceding two notes) and another 2 groups between hm.f and ntrw. The first lacuna undoubtedly contained the object of 3byt, and the size of the gap suggests that only a single noun or verb has been lost. The relationship be- tween the three portions of surviving text is uncertain. Two interpretations seem possible, depending on whether the text between the two lacunae belonged to the preceding clause or to the one follow- ing. In the first instance, [. . .] w hm.f was probably part of the object of Tbyt, and a new clause began after hm.f with ntrw its subject and hr snt its "pseudoverbal" predicate: "[But] this great [god] was desiring [. . .] His Incarnation, [. . .] the gods were asking for.. " In the second, the clause break occurred after Ebyt; [...]w hm.f [. . .] ntrw then formed a second clause, with hm.f its subject, and hr Int was a third clause circumstantial to the preceding one: "[But] this great [god] was desiring [...], [...] His Incarnation [. . .] the gods, asking for.. " Although the surviving text, as available in Vandersleyen's publication, does not permit a definitive choice between these two interpretations, several factors support the first. In 11. 12 F and 14 B, the clause "so that he received what he had de- sired" is preceded by clauses describing how Ahmose reached "the interior of the Theban nome" and "encountered" the god's processional image (see the relevant notes to these lines below), suggesting that these actions were in fact the object of the god's desire. This in turn indicates that [. . .] w hm.f is the object of 3byt in 11. 6 F and 7 B, and that the lacuna contained some verb denoting the king's "coming" or "return." Although the quail-chick before him.f is not followed by a determinative, it could have belonged to the missing verb-form if the latter ended in w, with "walking-legs" deter- minative before the quail-chick: for example, the verb nw, "return" (Wb. II, 220-21). Alternatively, the quail-chick could be the end of the dependent pronoun [s]w, referring either to the god or, reflex- ively, to the king himself. Orthographically, this is somewhat likelier. The missing verb must remain conjectural, but the transitive en, which is used with a reflexive pronoun (Wb. I, 188, 18), suits the context. The signs of [cn s]w fill a space of about 1l groups rather than the 2 to 3 conjectured in the note before last, but the restoration is feasible if the preserved text of 1. 6 F occupied about two more groups on the back (cf. the notes on the text at the end of 11. 11 B and 12 B, below). Although the clause could have ended with [Cn s]w hm.f the normal use of Cn with a prepositional phrase speci- fying the destination or origin of the action suggests a similar phrase in the lacuna following hm.f The usual prepositions are hr or r, "away from," or n, "to"; of these, the first two are unlikely in the context and the latter is possible only with a nominal object, for which the lacuna seems too small. The traces visible on the photograph and in Vandersleyen's drawing ("Temp~te," pls. 8 and 8A) would suit r.f, "to him," referring to the god (see Wb. III, 315, 16).</page><page sequence="10">10 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES [jw] ntrw hr int hnw.sn [nbw] (11. 6 F, 7-8 B) The arguments of the preceding note indicate that a new clause began in the lacuna before ntrw, with ntrw its subject and hr int its "pseudoverbal" predicate. The introductory particle jw suits the space available (if [rr.f] is restored at the end of the preceding clause), and the trace visible before ntrw on the photograph and in Vandersleyen's drawing ("Tempete," pls. 8 and 8A) could well be the back of the quail-chick. The interpretation of the predicate is largely dependent on the identity of the noun that served as the object of int, which depends in turn on the lost sign that stood above the n in the group following h.8 Vandersleyen ("Tempete," p. 132) suggested hnw(t), "service" (Wb. III, 102, 8-9), h[k]nw, "acclamations," or h[d]nw, "discontent," and opted for the last, in which he has been followed by Ritner ("Thera Eruption," p. 11). This interpretation is questionable, however, on semantic and contextual grounds. The verb inj seems to have the normal meaning "ask for, look for" (Wb. IV, 495); it can also mean "recite" (Wb. IV, 495, 17: hence, also "enchant," Wb. IV, 496, 2-6) but does not seem to have the extended meaning "express" required by Vandersleyen's translation.9 Moreover, the notion of the gods "expressing their displeasure" immediately after the description of Ahmose's homage to Amun and (probably) other gods in Karnak connotes an unlikely disparagement of the king's actions. Of the various other reconstructions possible for the object of snt, Vandersley- en's first alternative, hnw(t).sn, is likeliest, probably referring to the cult of the gods. The expression ntrw hr snt is parallel to the preceding [ntr] pn c3 hr 3byt (cf. 1. 10 F / 12 B r b3w n ntr c3 r shrw ntrw) and suggests the normal interpretation of hr Snt: "asking for their cult-services." For the fol- lowing [nbw], see the next note. [ChC.n rdi.n] ntrw jwt pt m dc n h[ wyt, kkw] m r C jmnt (11. 6-7 F, 8 B) The use of ntrw after the preceding, coreferential sn indicates that a new sentence began in the lacuna. As Vandersleyen noted ("Temp&amp;te," p. 133), the form jwt and the parallel with Westcar 11, 14 (ChC.n rdi.n.sn jwt pt m dC hr h.wyt) indicate that the sentence began with the initial construction ChC.n rdi.n. The size of the lacuna in 1. 8 B is about 1 group larger than the 2? groups needed for these initial words; the additional group probably contained the last word or so of the preceding sentence: perhaps nbw, "all," modifying hnw(t).sn. For the lacuna after dC n h[, the combination of preserved text in 11. 6-7 F and 8 B suits Helck's restoration of h[wyt kkw], though the slightly larger lacuna in 1. 8 B suggests a fuller spelling of hwyt similar to that of the parallel in Westcar 11, 14. pt fnc.tj (11. 7 F, 8-9 B) Despite Helck's division of the text, these two words probably belong together. The determinatives indicate a verbal form (stative) from the same root found otherwise in the noun inc, "cloud" (Wb. IV, 507, 3-9). The parallel sense of the preceding clause supports the meaning "beclouded," as opposed to Vandersleyen's "d6chain6" ("Tempte," p. 133) = Ritner's "unleashed" ("Thera Eruption," p. 11). nj wn[t 3bw, q(3).tj] r [nrw] rfwt, wsr[.tj r...... ] hr hiswt r irw qrtjmt 3bw (11. 7-8 F, 9-10 B) In 1. 9 B, the first lacuna (from wn to 4) contained 4? groups; the second (from wsr to the end of 1. 9 B), about 12 groups, of which 1. 8 F's hr hiswt r hrw occupied about 3?.

I, 6, 12) is plausible for the first lacuna, since the negation nj wn occurs only ex- ceptionally (B. Gunn, Studies in Egyptian Syntax [Paris, 1924], pp. 96 and 123), and there seems to be no other verb or noun beginning with wn that suits the context: following pt inc.tj, the qualifica- tion apparently indicates that there was no break in the cloud cover. The signs at the end of the lacuna are apparently to be restored as r [irw], as Vandersleyen suggested ("Temp~te," p. 134): the first sign, if it is in fact the trace of an r- sign, probably represents the preposition r, since brw alone does not seem to be written with an r-sign between the oar and the quail-chick (pace Helck), and there is no single verb or noun that suits both the context and the combination of the r-sign in this position and the "speaking-man" determinative. This leaves, in turn, about 2 groups between [3bw] and r [&amp;rw] to be filled by an expression that the prepositional phrase must have qualified. Helck's [q(3).tj] suits both the space and the context, although it is separated from its antecedent, h[wyt], by the two clauses describing darkness; as Vandersleyen saw ("Temp~te," p. 134), the comparison must indicate that the noise of the rainstorm was louder than the cries of alarm of the populace. The restoration as a whole can be fitted into the lacuna at the end of 1. 7 F (about 5 groups) and the beginning of 1. 8 F (about 12 groups). The line-break probably occurred after r &amp;rw, with r wt wsr occupying some 5 groups at the beginning of 1. 8 F and about 7 groups unrestored from wsr to hr 3swt, corresponding to the 8-9 groups for the latter gap in 1. 9 B; this division can be accommodated with a shorter spelling of q(3).t(j) on the face. The length of the gap from wsr to hr i3swt suggests that it contained two clauses (Vandersleyen, "Tempte," p. 134). The first, beginning with wsr, was probably an expression par- allel to that of the preceding clause: hence, Helck's wsr[.tj r... ]. In the second clause, Helck's sug- gested [kh3 .h(w)yt], "the rain howled," is probably too long for the lacuna on the face, since its 42 groups would leave only about 22 groups for the end of the preceding clause; [hr kh3], "howling," is more plausible, though equally conjectural. In any case, the comparative r brw qrw jmt 3bw points to some expression describing the noise of the storm.lo wn.jn pr nb jwyt nbt sprt.sn [ q.t, jmw.s mt, h3wt.sn] h.r mht hr mw mj smh.w nw dwyt (11. 8-9 F, 10-11 B) The lacuna spans about 7 groups on the face (12 less 5 for hr mht hr mw mj) and 10 on the back and contained the end of one clause and the beginning of another. The former most probably consisted of a single stative such as Eq, "perished"; the space available on the face suggests that sprt.sn (referring to the rains) was used transitively (Wb. IV 103, 7) rather than with following [r.s] (Vandersleyen, "Tempete," p. 137). The phrase hr mht hr mw mj smhw nw dwyt, "floating on the water like skiffs of papyrus," probably does not refer to the pr nb jwyt nbt, "every house and every habi- tation," preceding (since the usual construction material was mud-brick), but to the bodies of the dead, as Helck has seen. His [hl3wt.sn], "their corpses," is plausible but requires an antecedent such as [jmw.s mt], "those in them died," (cf. Wb. I, 72, 13). The restoration suggested here, though con- jectural, fills the space in 1. 10 B and would fit the smaller space in 1. 8 F with slightly abbreviated spellings. For the reading dwyt, see M. Gilula, "Egyptian nht = Coptic nahte 'to believe'," JNES 36 (1977): 295, n. 2; E. Edel, "Bemerkungen zu den SchieBsporttexten der K5nige der 18. Dynastie," SAK 7 (1979): 33 (I thank E.

Also on the face, the plural strokes of jdhyt are followed by a squarish trace that suits the head of the m-owl suggested by Vandersleyen ("Tempete," p. 137) and accepted by Helck. Together, these traces leave somewhat less than a group empty, at the top of which, between the m and hr, must have stood the r-sign visible on the back (Vandersleyen, "Tempete," p. 137). Below this lost sign the photograph of the face shows a vertical trace, just to the right of the stroke of hr but evidently half again as tall, and a vague J-shaped trace to its right (see Vandersleyen, "Tempete," p. 137: "la photo comporte une trace horizontale"). It is difficult to know what to make of these traces or how to incorporate them into the group that stood between m and hr, which evi- dently began with r. After Chnwtj, 1. 9 F continues with hntj r hrw to the end of the line. The lacuna of 11 groups at the beginning of 1. 10 F contained 1. 12 B's nj shd.n tk3 hr tRwj dd.jn hm.f; if the signs and spacing were the same on the face as in 1. 12 B, this leaves slightly more than 1 group empty at the beginning of 1. 10 F before nj, which undoubtedly contained a numeral: "for a period of x days." On the back, the space between the preserved plural strokes of jdhyt and r-sign fits the m-owl that probably stood in the same position on the face. After the r-sign there is a lacuna of 13 groups (if Lacau's restoration is discounted) to the end of the line, which must have contained 1. 9 F's hr Chnwtj h.ntj r hrw and the following numeral. Even with more generous spacing and spellings, however, this text accounts for only about 11 of the groups. Since it is unlikely that anything came between the numeral at the end of 1. 11 B and nj shd.n tk3, which begins the next line, the extra group probably stood between m r and hr. Thus, the text between jd~hyt and hr on the face contained the signs f_ and whatever stood below the r; the text on the back consisted of the same signs (in the same ar- rangement) probably followed by another group before hr. The two preserved signs almost certainly do not belong to one word: m is thus the preposition, followed by a noun beginning with r. Judging from the apparent stroke below the r-sign on the face, this may have been simply the noun r, "mouth, doorway" (if the other traces are simply fortuitous); the double reed-leaf with which this word is occasionally written (in the dual) in the meaning "doorway" (Wb. II 390-91) may have prompted Lacau's restoration of the extra group on the back. Since the combination m r/r[y] hr is otherwise unattested as a unit, two prepositional phrases were probably intended: m r/r[y] and hr Chnwtj. The first evidently means "in the doorway" (cf. Wb. II 391, 9). The second probably in- volves the coordinating function of hr (Wb. III 131, 25: "and the private apartments"), although the preposition conceivably also carries the connotation "into" (cf. Wb. III 131, 12 and 27-31; also Cq hr: Wb. I, 231, 8) and perhaps even "through into" (cf. Wb. III 132, 10). The sense is evidently that the waters, and their grisly cargo, reached even into the supposedly inviolate living quarters of the king himself. hntj r hrw [...] (11. 9-10 F, 11 B) Pace Vandersleyen, "Tempete," pp. 139 and 155, this phrase probably qualifies the clauses im- mediately preceding, which refer to the flooding caused by the storm (11. 8-9 F, 10-11 B wn.jn pr nb... hr Chnwtj) and not to the length of the deluge itself; the following clause describes a second feature of the storm, darkness (see next note: to 11. 10 F, 12 B). The probable lacuna of 1 group or slightly more (see previous note, to 11. 9-10 F, 11 B) argues against the numerals 1-3, 6, 10-13, and 20-23, all of which would surely or probably have filled less than a single group. A numeral greater than 29 would probably have been expressed in terms of months rather than days. The duration is thus 4-5, 7-9, 14-19, or 24-29 days, with the lower numbers most likely. nj shd.n tki hr tRwj (10 F, 12 B) For the circumstantial use of nj sdm.n.f, see Gunn, Studies, pp. 112 and 113-14; Gardiner, EG, ? 105. The relationship between shd.n and tk3 is ambiguous. Since shd can be used without object</page><page sequence="13">THE AHMOSE TEMPEST STELA AND THE THERAN ERUPTION 13 in the meaning "give light" (Wb. IV, 225, 24), tki could be meant as its subject: "while no torch could give light over the Two Lands." Alternatively, tkI3 could be the object of shd.n (cf. the evi- dence cited by Vandersleyen, "Temp~te," p. 140), which would then have an unexpressed subject: "while no one could light a torch over the Two Lands." The former is marginally preferable, since the latter relationship is more likely to have been expressed by a passive or impersonal construction (nj shd tkI, nj shd.n.tw tkA). Moreover, the slight hyperbole of the first interpretation is somewhat better suited to the context ("the darkness was so intense that not even a torch could relieve it") than the more prosaic connotation of the second ("the rain prevented torches from being lit"-Vander- sleyen's "que la temp~te a rendu impossible": "Temp~te," p. 140; similarly, "torrent so that no torch could be lit": Ritner, "Thera Eruption," p. 5). wrwj ni r b3w n ntr C r shrw ntrw (11. 10 F, 12 B) The text is preserved in 1. 10 F except for the signs under the c-sign and above the r-sign of shrw. The orthography restored here is perhaps likelier than that suggested by Vandersleyen ("Tempete," pl. 8A). In 1. 12 B, the line ended with hIt pw, which cannot have taken more than 3? groups (versus 3 in 1. 10 F). The rest of the lacuna (10 groups) is more than ample for the missing text n ntr c3 r shrw ntrw (6? groups in 1. 10 F): even with more generous spacing and a fuller spelling of Ci, it is about 1 group too large. Since it is unlikely that the back contained additional text, the additional group may have accommodated a "seated-god" determinative and plural strokes after three ntrw signs, although this spelling is not otherwise attested on the stela (cf., however, 1. 8 B). hit pwjr.n hm.f rjmw.f, qnbt.f m ht.f, mC.i[f] hrjibtt .hrjmntt (11. 10-11 F, 12-13 B) The lacuna in 1. 11 F (11 groups) is, unusually, slightly larger than needed for the text of 1. 13 B (10 groups): the difference probably lay in the determinatives of mSc or in the arrangement of those of qnbt. In 1. 13 B, there is a break of only 1 group between the mic-sign and the following hr; the msc-sign is clear, and the bottom of the stroke below the hr-face is still visible. This supports Helck's restoration of mic.[f] as opposed to Vandersleyen's "population" ("Tempte," p. 141; followed by Ritner, "Thera Eruption," p. 11). The latter sense of mic is not attested until the Late Period (Wb. II 156, 13: see Vandersleyen, "Temp~te," p. 136) and would probably have required more than a single group for the determinatives of the seated man and woman and plural strokes (cf. 1. 9 B riwt). The passage evidently states that the king was followed in his river journey by his "council" (qnbt), per- haps in other boats, while his army (mscC) accompanied the voyage on either bank of the river (see Helck, Texte der 2. Zwischenzeit, p. 96, 1. 2). hr hipw, nn hbsw hr.s m it hpr b3w ntr (11. 11-12 F, 13-14 B) Vandersleyen ("Tempete," p. 141), followed by Ritner ("Thera Eruption," p. 11), understood these clauses to refer to the state of the mic ("silencieuse, car elle n'avait plus de vtements(?) sur elle"; "had hidden faces, having no clothing on them"), analyzing .hr h.pw as the noun "face" plus third person masculine singular stative and hr.s of the second clause as referring back to msc. This is grammatically possible (for hr.s, see Gardiner, EG, ??510-11), but it yields an odd image in the con- text, particularly since mic probably refers to the army and not to the general populace, as Van- dersleyen thought (see previous note); moreover, mic is normally resumed by a plural pronoun (see Helck, Texte der 2. Zwischenzeit, p. 96, 1. 3). Alternatively, hIr h.pw can be analyzed as a circum- stantial clause "providing cover," in which h pw is a verbal noun (literally, "secreting") rather than the usual infinitive: cf. hr imsw "following" (Wb. IV, 487, 11). The pronoun in the following clause more plausibly refers back to the preceding jibtt and jmntt, while hbsw denotes not "clothing" but the more extended meaning "covering" (see Wb. III, 65, 2-8). The image of the two clauses is then one of the army providing "cover" for the king's river journey, perhaps considered necessary because</page><page sequence="14">14 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES the normal screen offered by the vegetation of the riverbanks had been swept away by the ravages of the storm (m ht hpr b3w ntr). spr pw jr.n hm.f r hn n west (11. 12 F, 14 B) The text preserved on the back fills the lacuna at the beginning of 1. 12 F almost exactly. Since the following clause refers to the processional image of the god, the phrase hn n west here is perhaps a reference to the temple of Karnak: besides lying in the heart of Thebes, this temple had a canal lead- ing into it from the river, along which Ahmose's fleet could have sailed into "the interior of Thebes." For the phrase hn n west, cf. the similar hn(w) west: Helck, Texte der 2. Zwischenzeit, p. 82, 11. 7- 8 and p. 87, 11. 13-14 (noted by Vandersleyen, "Tempete," p. 142); P. Vernus, "La stale du pharaon Mntw-htpi 'a Karnak," RdE 40 (1989): 149. nbw hz m [nbw] sim pn (11. 12 F, 14 B) Helck's restoration of the second nbw is undoubtedly correct: the gap is only 1 group wide, the determinative and one of the plural strokes is preserved at its bottom, and the right-hand edge of the break at the top suits the corresponding edge of the nbw sign. The verbal phrase hz m is probably stative; Vandersleyen's discussion ("Temp~te," pp. 142-43) supports the meaning "encounter" (re- flected in Ritner's "confronting(?)": "Thera Eruption," p. 11), although the connotation "return to" may also have been intended. The clause is evidently a metaphorical reference to Ahmose coming before the image of Amun. For the king as nbw, "gold," see H. Grapow, Die bildliche Ausdriicke des Aegyptischen (Leipzig, 1924), p. 57. Qzp.f3b(t).n.f (ll. 12 F, 14 B) This is probably a clause of result referring back to ssim pn. The expected feminine ending of the relative sdm.n.f is omitted on the face but could have been present on the back, where there is slightly more room. hr ssmt mhywt (11. 13 F, 15 B) The lacuna at the beginning of 1. 13 F is about ( group longer than the preserved text of the back; the discrepancy may have been taken up by a slightly different spelling of mhzywt or nj ?b.f (see next note). The final determinative of the former appears to be only a slightly larger version of the normal z-sign on this stela and not the "canal" sign seen by Vandersleyen ("Tempete," p. 143). The sense of ssmt may be simply its normal "lead," rather than Vandersleyen's "faire 6vacuer" ("Tem- pete," p. 143) or Ritner's "drain" ("Thera Eruption," p. 11): the clause describes how the king pro- vided guidance for the areas flooded by the rains. nj ib.f (11. 13 F, 15 B) The sign below the negative-arms is only partially preserved and is damaged. Vandersleyen saw it as a seated man with raised arm ("Tempete," p. 144), while Helck restored it as the hd-mace. Nei- ther of these, however, yields any perceptible sense. As Vandersleyen saw ('Tempete," p. 144), the pronominal suffix must refer to the king. Vandersleyen also noted that "On attendrait une expression comme 'sans relache'." In fact, the questionable sign could well have been a damaged jb-sign, which this stela uses in spelling the root 3bj, "desire" (11. 12/14 F, 7/14/16 B), yielding a somewhat abbre- viated but plausible spelling of the verb 3bj, "stop" (the lacuna at the beginning of 1. 13 F could have accommodated a more normal spelling: see the previous note to 11. 13 F, 15 B). The resulting nj ?b.f is probably an independent statement, with the following hr snmt st circumstantial to it.</page><page sequence="15">THE AHMOSE TEMPEST STELA AND THE THERAN ERUPTION 15 m g3w nb n 3obw (11. 14 F, 16 B) For the final n 3bw, Ritner's "that could be desired" ("Thera Eruption," p. 11) is preferable to Vandersleyen's "de tous produits a volontC" ("Temp~te," pp. 142, 145). In the expression m g3w, Vandersleyen saw the abstract giw, "lack" (Wb. V, 152, 8-13) and Ritner the noun g1wt, "bundle" (Wb. V, 153, 3-7). Here Vandersleyen's reading is more likely, since the final t of g~wt, "bundle" is absent. Also, the general sense "every lack" is better suited to the phrase in this position, where it seems to be a summation of the preceding detailed description of the king's munificence-intro- duced, like them, by the preposition m. The phrase as a whole means literally "every lack of desir- ability," i.e., every need whose alleviation could be desired. sndm pw jr.n hm.f m hnw pr-c3 (11. 14 F, 16 B) Although sndm can have the connotation "reside" (Wb. IV, 187, 7), its root meaning (when used intransitively) seems to be "come to rest," and this meaning suits the present context. The clause marks a break with the preceding narrative and an introduction to what follows. Where the former dealt with the king's measures for relief of the living (11. 12-14 F, 15-16 B), the latter concerns his restitution of the mortuary and divine estates. wn.jn.tw hr sh3t n hm.f (ll. 14-15 F, 17 B) Although it is often translatable as "remember," the verb sh3 has the basic meaning "bring to mind" (cf., for example, Peas. R 11, 1 and Leb. 56, where this must be the meaning, rather than "re- member"). This seems to be the sense in the present passage, where the king's courtiers "remind" him of what has yet to be done. Cq d&amp;twt (11. 15 F, 17 B) The verb-forms are probably infinitives serving as object of sh3, "remind." In the first phrase, Vandersleyen's interpretation of the word following Cq as "funerary domains" ("Tempete," p. 146) is supported by the three nouns in the following phrases (see next notes). The remainder of the stela, however, which details the king's response to this "reminder," seems to deal with the temples of the gods: note, in particular, the reference to simw, "processional images" (11. 17, F, 20 B), which can hardly refer to a funerary complex. In that light, d43twt may have a somewhat broader connotation of "sacred estates" (see Wb. IV, 98, 13-15). See, however, the discussion below. whn js(y)w (11. 15 F, 17 B) As Vandersleyen notes ("Temp~te," p. 147), whn normally denotes the destruction of an edifice (walls or buildings), though it can be used figuratively with other objects (Wb. I, 345, 8-9 and 12). Although js often seems to have specific reference to the rock-cut chambers of a tomb (Vander- sleyen, "Tempte," p. 147), its use as object of whn here-and in contrast to hwwt and mrw follow- ing-suggests the more general sense "tomb." ib3 hwwt (11. 15 F, 17 B) The verb bb3 is regularly used of the willful destruction of buildings or lands; note especially its use with the object js, "tomb": Griffith, "A New Monument from Coptos," JEA 2 (1915): pl. 3, B 2.

The reduplicated wCwc, "fell (an enemy)" (Wb. I, 280, 9-11), which is probably related, suggests the meaning "topple," as Vandersleyen has seen ("Temp~te," p. 147): note K.

E Wente for this reference). jryt tmmt jr (11. 15-16 F, 18 B) This phrase serves as a general summary of the preceding four. Vandersleyen ("Tempete," pp. 147- 48) has noted the parallel with Neferti'sjryt m tmmtjr, "made into what had not been made" (Helck, Die Prophezeiung des Nfr.tj, 2d ed. [Wiesbaden, 1992], 11. IVc and Xd). Since the m is omitted in both of the present instances, the construction here must be somewhat different, although both jryt and tmmt jr clearly contain passive participles, as in Neferti's text. It is possible that the two are to be understood as conjoined: i.e., as referring to the destruction ("what had been done") and the lack of attention to it ("what had not been done"). Alternatively, the phrase may have been intended as a "passive relative" construction (passive participle with "retained object": Gardiner, EG, ?377): liter- ally, "that which the not-having-been-done was done." The latter is perhaps likelier in view of the lit- erary parallels, although the absence of a resumptive pronoun might support the former interpretation. srwd rw-prw... tzt snbwt.sn (11. 16-17 F, 18-19 B) For r-pr, "temple" (contra Vandersleyen, "Tempete," p. 148) and snbwt, "(upper part of the) en- closure wall," see Spencer, The Egyptian Temple, pp. 37-42 and 278-81. rdit dsrw m Ct spst, hip st ?t4wt, scqt ssmw r k3rw.sn (11. 17 F, 19-20 B) The reference to ssrmw, "processional images," here points to temples of the gods rather than tombs. In that light, the term Ct Ipst probably refers-like the st st3wt and kirw of the following clauses-to the "off-limits" areas of the temples. By dsrw is probably meant the cult objects, in which case Ct spst will have denoted something like the temple treasury: see Spencer, The Egyptian Temple, p. 281; J. Hoffmeier, Sacred in the Vocabulary of Ancient Egypt, OBO 59 (Freiburg and Got- tingen, 1985), pp. 198-99. The use of hip, "conceal," suggests that st it3wt may refer to the temple crypts: crypts are known for the Eighteenth-Dynasty temples at Buhen and Sesebi (C. Traunecker in LA, vol. 3, col. 823). smn piwt.sn (11. 18 F, 20-21 B) The form is undoubtedly that of the infinitive (cf. rdit tB following), but the expected feminine ending is omitted on both sides: cf. 11. 13 F / 15 B hr smnt t3wj. jr.jn.tw mj wdt.n nbt hm.f (jrt) (11. 18 F, 21 B) The lacuna at the end of 1. 21 B is about 2 groups too large for the text of 1. 18 F. From the spacing of wd, it is clear that the scribe was aware of the extra space and had begun to separate the signs more widely than usual in order to fill it. Nonetheless, some 2 groups would still have been left empty at the end of the line if the scribe had used only the text of 1. 18 F and a spelling of hm.f in</page><page sequence="17">THE AHMOSE TEMPEST STELA AND THE THERAN ERUPTION 17 1 groups (cf. . 1. 18 B). One of these extra groups could have been filled by giving the suffix pronoun its own group. The other may have been left blank, but it could also have been filled by an additional infinitive jrt serving as object of wd (see Gardiner, EG, ?385): i.e., "everything that His Incarnation commanded to do." If so, the jrt may have been present in the original text and omitted in 1. 18 F for lack of space. DISCUSSION OF THE TEXT The text of the stela can be divided thematically into five sections: introduction (11. 1- 3 on both faces), Ahmose's homage to the gods (11. 3-6 F, 3-8 B), description of the storm (11. 6-10 F, 8-12 B), the king's immediate response to the crisis (11. 10-14 F, 12-16 B), and further restorations ordered by Ahmose (11. 14-18 F, 16-21 B). The introduction sets the background of the stela's narrative. It contains Ahmose's full titulary, followed by an infinitival clause mentioning the king's "coming"; the destination has been lost in the short lacuna after the infinitive but was undoubtedly Thebes and perhaps more specifically Karnak."1 The infinitival clause was introduced by two particles (s[t] r.f) or a preposition ([l]f[t]); this unusual feature, coupled with the fact that the scene above the text on both sides is slightly off-center, suggests that an initial column containing the stela's date may have been present to the left of the scene on both faces. Af- ter the lacuna, the text continues with a clause noting that "the Sun himself had designated him king," followed by two further circumstantial clauses contrasting the king's "settling" south of Dendera with the presence of "A[mun-Re, lord of thrones of the Two Lands]," in Thebes. These three clauses suggest that Ahmose's trip to Thebes was in the nature of a state duty shortly after his coronation, which then evidently did not take place in Thebes. If so, the stela probably dates to Ahmose's first regnal year; this conclusion is supported by several orthographic features of the text.12 The next section, detailing the king's activities in Thebes, is the least well preserved. It begins with mention of an offering-ceremony; this was followed by some other activity probably involving a plural subject or object, which seem to have been "put" somewhere in Thebes. The next preserved clauses describe the reentry of the processional image of the god (probably Amun) into the temple and his satisfaction: these suggest that the miss- ing activity was a procession of the image of Amun and perhaps also those of the other Theban gods. The pairing and contrast between Amun ("this great god," "this processional image") and "the gods" is one of the recurring themes of the text and may have been sounded here for the first time. The content of the final major lacuna in this section (11. 5- 6 F, 6-7 B) is uncertain, but it probably involved mention of the king's return from Thebes to his residence. The partially preserved clauses following this lacuna (11. 6 F, 7-8 B) are among the most problematic of the entire text, since they seem to provide the theological basis of the storm. Although the exact relationship between the three surviving fragments of text is uncertain, they most probably contain the remnants of two parallel clauses: the first mentioning the "desire" of Amun ([ntr] pn C?3 hr 3byt) and the second the "demands" of the other gods 11 Where they are not otherwise documented, the grounds for the conclusions here and in the following paragraphs can be found in the notes following the translation. 12 Vandersleyen, "Tempete," p. 151; idem, "Frag- ments," p. 132.</page><page sequence="18">18 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES (ntrw hr int). The first clause is evidently referred to subsequently in the text, where the description of the king's return to Thebes and his encounter with Amun's image is followed by the words "so that he (the god) received what he had desired" (11. 12 F, 14 B). This suggests that the object of Amun's desire was the king's return-prompting, in turn, the restoration of a sentence mentioning the king's departure and the contrastive particles [jst grt], "but," in the lacuna before the first clause. In the second clause, Vandersleyen saw a reference to the gods "expressing their displeasure." This is unlikely, however, both on lexicographical grounds and, more importantly, because of the context in which it occurs: following a description of Ahmose's ritual ministrations in Thebes-with which Amun, at least, appears to have been satisfied-it would imply an improbable disparagement of the king's actions. The key to the meaning of this clause appears to lie in the parallel theme of "the great god," on the one hand, and "the gods," on the other, which is sounded throughout the stela. Ahmose's explicit response to the storm-"How much greater is this than the impressive manifestation of the great god, than the plans of the gods!" (11. 10 F, 14 B)-indicates that both "the great god" and "the gods" were considered agents of its occurrence. The de- scription of his subsequent actions follows the same pattern: first he returns to Amun's presence in Thebes, then-following measures taken for the relief of the country-he or- ders restoration of "the temples that had fallen to ruin in this entire land." The pair of clauses in 11. 6 F and 14 B are probably to be understood in the same light: as parallel state- ments of the theological basis for the storm. In the mind of the Egyptians, the catastrophe was evidently seen as a manifestation of Amun's desire that Ahmose return to Thebes and of the gods' demand that he turn his attention to the state of their temples. The description of the tempest itself, which follows in the next section, is relatively complete, or plausibly restorable, except for a single large lacuna. The main features of the storm were apparently torrential rain;13 darkness;14 and loud noise, probably from thun- der or wind, or both.1" The text does not note the duration of the deluge, but its aftermath is described as lasting for a period of several days or even weeks. It evidently occasioned large-scale flooding, property damage, and loss of life; the mention of "the east and west (banks)" being denuded of "covering" suggests that it also washed away large sections of cropland. All of these features are consonant with archaeological evidence for, and modern descriptions of, similar storms,16 including the two recent deluges that devastated much of Upper Egypt in October and November 1994; like the latter, it seems to have come from the west ("[dark]ness in the western region" 11. 7 F, 8 B).17 This view has an antecedent of sorts in Papyrus Westcar II, 9-15, where a group of gods create a rainstorm as an excuse to return to their place of departure. The extent of the storm is also uncertain. Three passages in the text seem to imply that it affected the entire country: "no torch could give light over the Two Lands" (11. 10.,F, 13 "Storm of r[ain]" (11. 7 F, 8 B); "flooded areas" (11. 13 F, 15 B); "[their corpses] floating on the water like skiffs of papyrus, (even) in the doorway and the private apartments (of the palace)" (11. 9 F, 10-11 B). 14 "[Dark]ness in the western region and the sky be- clouded without [stop]" (11. 7 F, 8-9 B); "no torch could give light throughout the Two Lands" (11. 10 F, 12 B). 15 "[Loud]er than [the sound of] the subjects, strong[er than ..., howling(?)] on the hills more than the sound of the cavern in Elephantine" (11. 7-8 F, 9-10 B). 16 See Vandersleyen, "Temp~te," p. 155 and n. 4. 17 Storms associated with flooding of the Nile are recorded in ancient times as occurring in Punt and Nubia: A. Lloyd, "Once More Hammamat Inscription 191," JEA 61 (1975): 54-55.</page><page sequence="19">THE AHMOSE TEMPEST STELA AND THE THERAN ERUPTION 19 12 B), "then His Incarnation was stabilizing the Two Lands" (11. 12-13 F, 15 B), and "then His Incarnation commanded to make firm the temples that had fallen to ruin in this entire land" (11. 16 F, 18 B). Despite these references, Vandersleyen saw the deluge as localized in the Theban area; Foster and Ritner, however, have argued for a more literal interpreta- tion of the text.'8 The reality may have been somewhere between these two views. If the flooded "doorway" and "private apartments" mentioned in 11. 9 F and 11 B were those of the king's residence, as seems likely, the deluge will have reached at least from Thebes to the region south of Dendera. On the other hand, if the stela dates to the beginning of Ahmose's reign, as argued above, the phrases "Two Lands" and "this entire land" cannot have had their usual literal reference to the Nile Valley and the Delta combined, since the latter, at least, was still under the control of the rival Hyksos regime. Nonetheless, the use of these phrases in the text does suggest, as Foster and Ritner have seen, that the storm was not limited to the Theban area. More than likely it affected the entire extent of Egypt under Ahmose's care: in that respect, it will have been comparable to the recent storm of 1994, which caused flooding both in Luxor and the Cairo area. Foster and Ritner suggested that an earthquake may have accompanied the tempest,19 but the text offers no good evidence for this. The only place it could have been mentioned explicitly is in the one or two missing clauses beginning with "strong" and ending with "on the hills more than the sound of the cavern in Elephantine" (11. 8 F, 9 B), and the sur- viving text is ill-suited to the description of an earthquake. The suggestion of Foster and Ritner was based on the restorations detailed at the end of the text. While it is true that the destruction mentioned there could have resulted from earth tremors, the fact that an earthquake does not seem to be noted specifically along with the other meteorological phenomena-which are described in some detail in the text-puts such an interpretation in doubt, and there is in fact another plausible explanation for the devastation (see below). The fourth section of the text deals with Ahmose's response to the storm. The king's initial statement that the catastrophe was "much greater.., . than the impressive manifes- tation of the great god, than the plans of the gods" seems to imply, as Vandersleyen noted, that it "surpassed the thought, the intention of the gods."20 Unusual as it is, the notion of events exceeding the original intent of their divine author has a literary parallel of sorts in the story known as "The Destruction of Mankind," which describes the sungod's efforts to stop the slaughter of human beings begun by Hathor on his orders. Ahmose's first action was to set out by boat for Thebes-thus implying that he had left the region sometime before the storm. On the journey, he was accompanied by his council and a military escort. The latter was apparently intended to cover (literally, "conceal") the flotilla along either bank, probably in lieu of the natural screen of vegetation that seems to have been washed away by the deluge. If this interpretation is correct, it offers an interesting insight into the contemporary political situation: the extra measure of security may have been deemed nec- essary either because of the unrest attendant on Ahmose's ongoing struggle with the rival Hyksos regime or because the king feared being overwhelmed by a population demanding relief from the disaster, if not both. 18 Vandersleyen, "Temp&amp;te" pp. 140, 143, 148-49; Foster and Ritner, "Thera Eruption," pp. 5-6. 19 Foster and Ritner, "Thera Eruption," p. 7. 20 Vandersleyen, "Tempete," p. 140. See, however, p. 24 below.</page><page sequence="20">20 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Once in Thebes, the king's first destination was the "interior" of the town (or nome)- probably a reference to the temple or Karnak-where he came into the presence of Amun. The description of this event-"gold encountered the gold of this processional image"- implies that Ahmose met the god as an equal and therefore that his journey was viewed as a state visit rather than a pilgrimage of supplication. Its priority in the list of the king's actions evidently reflects not only the status of the two participants, but also the perceived causality of the storm, as argued above. Following this initial duty, Ahmose turned his at- tention to the relief of the country and in particular to the regions most affected by the rains. It is perhaps significant that the list of supplies with which the king "fed" these areas does not include food: this can be seen as a further indication of the storm's effect on the cultivation. The final section in the text, which is also the longest, begins with the king's return to his residence. Once there, he is "reminded" of other areas in need of attention. The initial list seems to be limited to private tombs and royal mortuary complexes, while the list de- tailing Ahmose's orders deals with the restoration of the temples. Despite the apparent dis- tinction, however, both were probably considered as belonging to the domain of the gods.21 This section as a whole therefore constitutes a response to the second perceived cause of the catastrophe: "the gods were asking for their cult-services." Vandersleyen has argued that the devastation of these monuments was caused by the rains, while Foster and Ritner have suggested the additional agency of an earthquake.22 In the case of the tombs and mortuary monuments, however, the verbs used in the text con- note purposeful destruction: "entering (Cq)... dismantling (whn) ... hacking up (hb3)... toppling (wc) . . . doing what had not been done (jryt tmmt jr)." Since these are regularly used with human agents, the normal implication here is one of willful wreckage-in that case, presumably a reference to the ravages wrought by the conflict between Ahmose's predecessors and the Hyksos.23 The verbs referring to the ruin of the temples, in contrast, imply agentless neglect rather than destruction: "fallen to ruin (w3 r wis)... fallen to the ground (pth r ti)."24 In both cases, therefore, the text seems to indicate that the state of these monuments was not due to the storm but, rather, existed before it. This makes excel- lent sense both in view of the statement that "the gods were asking for their cult-services" and in light of the wording of the introductory statement "then one was reminding His Incarnation." The text seems to draw a deliberate parallel between the situation caused by the storm and that which existed before it. In the first case, the need for restorative mea- sures was immediate and obvious; in the second, the need was no less serious but was evidently inconspicuous enough, or of long enough standing, that the king needed to be reminded of its necessity-a reminder no doubt prompted by the parallel offered by the more recent devastation. 21 For the dead as "gods," see Leb. 142 wnn mz ntj jm m ntr Cnh, "surely, he who is there (in the necrop- olis) will be a living god." 22 Vandersleyen, "Tempte," pp. 147, 153; Foster and Ritner, "Thera Eruption," p. 7. 23 Cf.

The inscription is remarkable not only for the events it describes, but also for the rationale it offers for those events: an attempt by the gods to draw the king's attention to their needs, which might otherwise have been overlooked in the midst of the political crisis facing the new pharaoh. The restoration of order out of chaos is a prominent theme in the initial inscriptions of every new reign, and this stela ob- viously belongs to that genre-erected to commemorate not the catastrophe, but the king's response to it.25 While there is no reason to doubt the historical accuracy of the events it records, these should be seen within that broader context. Ahmose's efforts are clearly painted in general as well as specific terms: although they begin by addressing the im- mediate problem of relief from the storm's devastation, they ultimately extend to all the things that need to be put right "in this entire land." The king's attention is directed not only to the recent destruction wrought by nature but also to the more longstanding ruin caused by human agency and neglect-all of which are seen as legitimate and necessary objects of his duty "to put the land like its original situation." III. THE THERAN ERUPTION, THE STORM, AND THE CONTEXT OF THE TEMPEST STELA Malcolm H. Wiener THE EARTHQUAKE HYPOTHESIS A. General Considerations The Foster-Ritner article refers in a number of instances26 to the earthquake at Thera that preceded the eruption, thus suggesting a causal connection to events in Egypt. Indeed, if the rainstorm were regarded as the sole causative agent of the physical destruction re- ported in the Stela, it would be difficult to suggest a reason why a storm centered on Thera, 1,000 km to the north of Thebes, rather than a typical monsoon-driven deluge com- ing down the Nile, should be regarded as the culprit (see below). What, then, is the like- lihood that an earthquake caused the volcanic eruption in Thera as well as the destruction in both Upper and Lower Egypt, with the two events so closely connected in time as to be perceived (at least from the cultic/dynastic viewpoint of the author of the Stela and his audience) as one? The Tempest Stela as preserved, otherwise so vivid and detailed in its description, does not mention an earthquake. Foster and Ritner suppose such a reference may have been contained in a few missing lines, a hypothesis that Allen regards as unlikely (see above). Rather, he believes the terminology of the Stela suggests willful human agency as the cause of the destruction of the tombs and mortuary monuments and neglect as the cause of the damage to temples. Egypt, on the whole, lies in a zone of only moderate seismicity, but to the north lies the Hellenic Arc running from the Saronic Gulf to Rhodes and the Anatolian coast, the 25 This can be seen as another argument in favor of dating the text to Ahmose's first regnal year. 26 Foster and Ritner, "Thera Eruption," pp. 2-3, 5, and 7.</page><page sequence="22">22 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Anatolian fault systems, and the collision structure along the Zagros mountains, which collectively mark the boundary of the Eurasian tectonic plate with the African and Ara- bian plates.27 Earthquakes in the Hellenic Arc have been known to cause significant dam- age in the Delta (which, however, would still have been under Hyksos control in Ahmose's Year 1) and on rare occasions to be felt in Upper Egypt, but there is only one recorded case of significant damage in Upper Egypt caused by an earthquake in the Hellenic Arc. The single exception was the great earthquake of 8 August 1303 (Thursday 23 Dhu'l-Hijja 702) which in Crete caused the collapse of many fortified sites and the deaths of 4,000 people; in Upper Egypt mud-brick houses in Qus were reported destroyed.28 Earthquakes resulting from volcanic eruptions are local in nature, unlike tectonic shifts, whose effects may be widespread. While volcanic events are not known to cause tectonic shifts, tectonic earthquakes may set in motion a process resulting in volcanic eruptions. The tectonic event and subsequent eruption(s) are sometimes separated significantly in time; for example, the eruption of Vesuvius which buried Pompeii and Herculaneum in A.D. 79 was preceded by a major earthquake seventeen years earlier in A.D. 62, whose damage was still under repair at the time of the eruption. What, then, is the earthquake record at Thera prior to the Late Bronze Age eruption? B. The Earthquake and Eruption of Thera The excavations at Akrotiri on Thera have revealed evidence of two earthquakes prior to the eruption. The first, early in Late Cycladic I, preceded the eruption by 50-75 years and caused great destruction, so much so that the rubble was left in place at some points and a new street level created at what had previously been an upper-floor window level, the former ground floors having become basements.29 The earthquake that caused great damage in Crete at the beginning of LM I may have been the same or a related event. The second earthquake at Akrotiri apparent in the archaeological record struck three months to two years before the eruption; damage from this quake was under repair at the time fumes at the beginning of the eruption drove the populace away.30 (A few scholars have suggested a longer time interval, based on what they perceive as a possible humus layer 27 N.

See Am- braseys, Melville, and Adams, The Seismicity of Egypt, pp. 42-43. The earthquake of 26 June 1926, with an epicenter in the eastern part of the Hellenic Arc, was felt in southwest Greece and Crete (as well as many parts of Italy) and caused the collapse of some adobe houses and some deaths in the Delta, but it was barely perceptible in Luxor (ibid., pp. 83-84). An earthquake of 12 September 1955 caused some damage in the Delta and was perceptible in both Athens and Luxor (ibid., p. 88). The major earthquake of 9 July 1956, which killed over forty and destroyed great numbers of the houses on Thera, was not felt in Egypt, however (Washington Post, 10 July 1956; Times [London], 10 July 1956 and 11 July 1956; The New York Times, 11 July 1956 and 12 July 1956; Life, 23 July 1956). 9 C.

Accordingly, the Foster-Ritner hypothesis would require that the epicenter of this earthquake be much closer to Egypt, yet still ca- pable of setting in motion a tectonic shift leading to the great eruption at Thera. Hence it is worth noting that a second major earthquake during LM IA severely damaged Trianda on Rhodes and the Seraglio on Kos prior to the Theran eruption that deposited large amounts of tephra on both sites. Marketou, who excavated the sites, observed that at Tri- anda at the time of the eruption "it seems that they had started to repair and rebuild their town due to a second earthquake, following a large-scale program of a Minoanizing char- acter"-which, however, again suggests the passage of some time between the earthquake and the eruption.32 It is perhaps particularly difficult to understand why an earthquake and a great storm pu- tatively caused by a volcanic eruption not less than three months later at the least should be perceived as one event (or even two closely related events) by the Stela's author. More- over, Allen has noted that the terms used in the Ahmose Tempest Stela to describe the physical effects on structures appear to refer to deliberate human action in the case of the monuments and tombs and to neglect in the case of the temples (see above). THE SOURCE AND NATURE OF THE STORM At the time of the Theran eruption the prevailing westerly winds were in full play, as evidenced by the heavy dispersal of tephra in an are to the east ranging from Rhodes, 210 km to the southeast (with a depth of deposit ranging from 90 cm to 3 m); Kos, 170 km to the east (depth of 12 cm); Gl1ctik Lake above Sardis, 330 km to the northeast (depth of 12 cm); seabed cores southeast of Thera and in the Black Sea north of Samsun, 1,000 km to the northeast; sediments from Kiycegiz Lake, 300 km east of Thera; further sediments from Gilhisar Lake northwest of Antalya; but only trace amounts of ash in the Nile Delta, 750 km to the southeast.33 (The Foster and Ritner reference to an "eastward and southward" 31 P.

As a gauge of the intensity of the tephra fall, it is worth noting that 10 cm of tephra is normally sufficient to collapse roofs. Given the strongly eastward direction of the tephra dispersal, it is all the more difficult to understand why, if the storm described was caused by the Theran erup- tion, the Stela should specify that the darkness appeared in the west, inasmuch as Thera is 800 km north-northwest of Memphis and 1,300 km north-northwest of Thebes, the points between which the storm was observed. While the description of the causes of damage, the separation in time from any known earthquake, and the location of the storm appear to argue strongly against a Theran-related event or events, the storm description fits well with monsoon-driven storms and floods, such as those that devastated parts of Upper and Lower Egypt in October and November 1994 and in January 1996 (see Allen above). Such monsoon-related storms create the dark- ened skies along the Nile and the noise that the Stela describes. They also create floods that cause water to enter buildings and denude river banks, sometimes causing landslides that destroy building foundations, as in the case of the heavy rainfalls in the Theban area in 1994-95, which caused tectonic movements of the ground.35 The Stela reports the Pha- raoh exclaiming: "How much greater is this than the impressive manifestation of the great god, than the plans of the gods!" (11. 10-14 F). An imputation of powerlessness on the part of Amun-Re and the other gods can be avoided by understanding the language to mean that the extent of the annual rains and Nile flood when satisfactory was the normal plan of the gods unless aroused, whereas the storm and flooding on this occasion exceeded the normal divine intent and plan. THE STELA TEXT IN CONTEXT Rather than describing the consequences of an earthquake and the atmospheric effects of the eruption of Thera, the Ahmose Tempest Stela appears to analogize the repair of storm and flood damage to the reconstruction of tombs, mortuary monuments, temples, and religious institutions required as a result of the destructive actions and neglect of human agents. The storm described thus appears to act theologically as a manifestation of Amun's desire that Ahmose return to Thebes, the seat of his worship and past glory as a major deity, and the gods' demand that Ahmose restore their temples and services (see Allen above). The fixing of offering-loaves and doubling of income of office-holders described by the Stela (11. 16-21 B) speak of institutional renovation rather than simply the repair of storm damage. The Stela can thus be seen as falling within the genre of permanent records de- scribing the restoration of order, such as the Speos Artemidos inscription of Hatshepsut Year 7-which, interestingly, also recounts a tempest, in this case one comprising nine days of raging storms and total darkness-and the Restoration Stela of Tutankhamun.36 Two days of unseasonable thunder and rain are reported in a text almost certainly of Hyk- sos date, the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (verso), as noted by Foster and Ritner.37 34 Foster and Ritner, "Thera Eruption," p. 2. 35 D.

As Allen notes above, the references to the "Two Lands" and "this entire land" cannot here have their usual full sense, since in Ahmose's Year 1 the Delta was still in Hyksos control. Conversely, the temples in Thebes remained under the direct control of the Seventeenth Dynasty, and its rulers apparently were able to continue their traditional function of making donations and even additions to temples within the southern part of Egypt, at least between Thebes and Abydos, including those at Coptos, Deir el-Ballas, Medamud, Edfu, and particularly Abydos, where the record of royal pa- tronage from the end of the Twelfth to the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasties included no mention of the Hyksos.38 (Of course these temples may have retained a historical sense of comparative neglect relative to the riches of the Twelfth Dynasty because of Hyksos su- zerainty and the loss of direct contact with Western Asia, even though the circumstances of the Twelfth Dynasty were not personally recalled by priests or populace.) As to the willful destruction by human agents of mortuary monuments and tombs that the Stela describes, it is probably necessary to look to the area of Memphis, and especially Dahshur, where such willful destruction to tombs and monuments during the late Thirteenth Dynasty has been observed.39 AN EXCURSUS ON THERAN PUMICE EXCAVATED AT TELL EL-DABCA (AVARIS) Foster and Ritner, in support of a date for the eruption in the reign of Ahmose, note in passing40 the appearance of Theran pumice in stratified contexts at several places at the site of the Hyksos capital of Avaris in the Delta, probably within the quarter century of the reigns of Tuthmosis I and II or possibly a little earlier,41 between ca. 1514 and 1479 on the middle chronology and twenty years earlier on the high chronology. The appear- ance of this pumice, waterborne and in secondary contexts, has indeed been cited by pro- ponents of the short or traditional Aegean chronology as important evidence in its favor.42 Tests now show the pumice to be of Theran origin.43 Whether the pumice has any rel- evance as a chronological indicator is, however, open to doubt. The deposits are clearly secondary ones, of pumice gathered for some purpose, probably industrial, as distinguished from airborne primary deposits of tephra or ash. Given the direction of Mediterranean cur- rents, pumice from Thera would float naturally to the Nile Delta. Manning has suggested 38 B.

For example, at the island of Pseira, two miles off the north coast of Crete, only about ten percent of the Theran pumice recovered comes from LM IA contexts close in time to the eruption, whereas about ninety percent is found in the LM IB destruction lev- els, a half-century after the eruption on the short chronology and a century later on the long chronology.45 At Zakros, on the east coast of Crete, significant amounts of pumice were found in an LM IB destruction context.46 J. Shaw notes that at Kommos, on the south coast of Crete, lumps of pumice are routinely found in most post-eruption strata.47 Deposits at other sites have been found in LM II-LH IIB, LM III, and even Hellenistic contexts.48 Pumice has a number of uses known from the Bronze Age and later antiquity. Evely notes that fragments of pumice were used in the predominantly metalworking milieu of the Unexplored Mansion at Knossos, including in one case in a disk with a central hole, per- haps for use in a lathe or lap-wheel.49 Evely also notes that pumice is an excellent abrasive for use in the manufacture of stone vases. Pichler observed that the lumps of pumice from Knossos (Unexplored Mansion) and Mallia which he had tested showed obvious signs of usage as tools.50 Blitzer's publication of seventy pieces of pumice from Kommos found under a bellows in an LM IIIA2-B context concludes that they had probably been used as insulation in metalworking and that other pieces had been used in finishing metal imple- ments.51 Faure notes fourteen separate uses of pumice recorded in classical antiquity: as an abrasive for stoneworking; in polishing marble, bone, and metal; in the preparation/tanning of skins/parchment; for cleaning potting clay; as a component of concrete or an additive to certain paints; as an agent to retard fermentation; in cleaning the skin; as a medicine or as a depilatory; as a counteragent for inebriation; and as toothpaste.52 One major use, as an abrasive, causes pumice to disappear through use, thereby argu- ably resulting in a recovery ratio highly skewed in favor of destruction levels such as the LM IB levels on Crete or the Eighteenth Dynasty final occupation level at Dabca, as distinguished from the date of its introduction into use. Those who believe the use of the waterborne pumice at Avaris followed the eruption closely in time argue that it would be remarkable if so useful a substance as pumice was ignored for a considerable period of time by the Hyksos and only used by the Eighteenth 44 S.

Possible explanations for the lack of evidence for Hyksos's use of pumice are that (1) the Hyksos metal or other workshop area has not yet been uncovered in the excavated part of the enormous site of Dabca, or (2) Hyk- sos metalworkers were accustomed to using other abrasives and so ignored the pumice floating in the Delta, perhaps because the existing method of production of metal had so- cial or symbolic significance resistant to change (as has been observed in other societies). It should be noted that if Allen is correct in ascribing the Stela to Ahmose's Year 1 (see above), then (on the assumption that the Stela describes the effects of the Theran eruption) a half-century would separate the eruption from the appearance of the pumice in the strati- graphic sequence at Avaris in any event (compared to the 110 to 130 years that the long Aegean chronology, which places the eruption at 1628 B.C., would require). Sieving of Tell el-DabCa is underway to search for earlier traces of Theran pumice or (better still, if extant) windblown ash from the eruption.53 We may summarize by posing the following questions to those who would link the Ahmose Tempest Stela to the Theran eruption: 1. Why is the Stela interpreted as implying an unmentioned earthquake, given the presence of terms indicative of human destruction and neglect? 2. If the earthquake that struck Akrotiri an estimated three months to two years before the eruption also devastated Upper and Lower Egypt as Foster and Ritner appear to suggest, why were this earthquake and the supposed eruption-created tempest perceived as a single event? 53 Bietak, personal communication of 10 January 1996. The Foster and Ritner article contains a small er- ror with respect to the appearance of pumice in a ritual context at the villa of Nirou Chani on the north coast of Crete: "Thera Eruption," p. 4, n. 18. The authors refer to "hundreds of pumice lumps, each in a con- ical cup," citing S. Hood, "Traces of the Eruption Out- side Thera," in C. Doumas, ed., Thera and the Aegean World, vol. 1 (London, 1978), pp. 681-90. The Hood article cited, however, speaks of "'hundreds' of little conical clay cups... and most of them held a lump of pumice" (p. 688), citing the report of the excavator, N. Platon, "'H dpyatooytKdi KivrltJ- Ev Kpiirl Ka zth &amp; ExH 1941-1947," XPHTIKA XPONIKA (KrChron) A (1947): 636; and "T&amp; Mtvo~iK OiKaKch 'IEp;," KrChron H (1954): 449-50. That report of the excavation, how- ever, simply says that lumps of pumice were found in conical cups, without any indication of number or pro- portion. (I, Wiener, am indebted to P Betancourt for confirming this interpretation.) Information on ritual uses of conical cups including the Nirou Chani instance is gathered in Wiener, "Crete and the Cyclades in LM I: The Tale of the Conical Cups," in R. Higg and N. Marinatos, eds., The Minoan Thalassocracy, Myth and Reality: Proceedings of the Third International Symposium at the Swedish Institute in Athens, 31 May-5 June 1982 (Stockholm, 1984), p. 20. A correction is also in order with respect to the citation of radiocarbon data. Foster and Ritner remark that "graphing the probability density [sic] for the date reveals a peak at 1619 B.C. and another at 1530 B.C." The work cited is out-of-date, however; in the 1993 decadal calibration, the second peak occurs at 1565 B.C., with the curve resuming a normal slope by 1535 B.c.: S. W. Manning, The Absolute Chronology of the Ae- gean Early Bronze Age: Archaeology, Radiocarbon and History, fig. 53a. In fact, the problems caused by (1) the oscillation in the calibration curve in the sixteenth cen- tury B.C. (the source or sources of which-sunspot ac- tivity, shifts in the earth's magnetic field, change in rates of discharge of radiocarbon from the ocean reservoirs, or whatever-are still not fully determined); (2) the annual and seasonal variation in the absorption of '4C by short-lived samples; and (3) the interlaboratory variability of results, provide major problems for de- termining the date of the Theran eruption via radiocar- bon analyses: see Wiener, Chronology (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="28">28 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 3. Why were the tempest and darkness perceived in the west, when Thera lies mostly to the north and the direction of winds carried the tephra strongly to the east? 4. How does the description of the storm and its consequences differ from that which would be expected of a typical monsoon-induced storm and resultant Nile flooding? 5. How do the sections of the Stela describing the support of temples and restoration of order differ significantly from other restoration-of-order texts, so as to make the Stela uniquely a reference to damage from the eruption of Thera? These questions lack convincing answers. Accordingly, it appears unlikely on balance that the Ahmose Tempest Stela refers to the Theran eruption.</page></plain_text>
