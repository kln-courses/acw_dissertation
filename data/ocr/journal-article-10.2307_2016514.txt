JULY 6, 1933 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY CHARLES PEIRCE 'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE1 WAT ITH the publication of his Collected Papers by Harvard Uni- versity a measure of justice is being done to Charles Peirce, long neglected except by a select few students. Unfortunately, the handsome volumes of this edition can not undo the damage which both Peirce and philosophy have suffered when he was not per- mitted, except for a brief period, to receive the intellectual and lit- erary discipline which regular university teaching would have given him. His was an erratic temperament, as his writings amply testify. His conception of philosophy was architectonic, and he tried to write it in a grand manner; but most of the hitherto unpublished material which has appeared thus far is obscure, uneven in quality, and, in spite of the best efforts of his editors, unsystematic. As he himself remarked in 1903, "All that you can find in print of my work on logic are simply scattered outcroppings here and there of a rich vein which remains unpublished. Most of it I suppose has been written down; but no human being could ever put together the fragments. I could not myself do so." It is not surprising, there- fore, that the writings in these first two volumes which are best from the point of view of clarity, consistency, and organization, are the articles published during his own lifetime. Until all the ten volumes will have been published it is impos- sible to evaluate adequately even the first two. Their contents will suggest, to any one familiar with the literature of the last quarter- century, many of the central ideas of better-known writers. It is easy to find something of Husserl, Whitehead, Santayana, Wittgen- stein and the logical positivists, Hilbert, Brouwer, and others, in the hints thrown out by Peirce, but left undeveloped. But whether these "anticipations " can legitimately be read outt of Peirce, in- stead of read into him, only the later volumes will perhaps definitely decide. It is not impossible that he may become everything to all men, and that rationalists and empiricists, naturalists and idealists, realists and nominalists, may all read him for support as well as 'A review of Collected Papers of Charles Saunders Peirce.

Peirce was often his own audience,2 and he could af- ford to be voluminous, repetitious, sketchy, and obscurely subtle. But to others it is not always evident what value much of his analy- sis has for clarifying problems of philosophy or science. His reader gets an impression of someone packing and preparing for an im- portant tour, but who somehow never crosses the gates of his own familiar city: we are shown the itinerary and given glowing promises of what is in store for us, but alas! too frequently the manuscript breaks off just before the train is scheduled to leave. Not even a complete summary can be given, in brief compass, of the contents of these volumes. This review must confine itself to a statement of just three important themes, and the interested reader mnust be left to examine at first hand many of the interesting varia- ions which Peirce embroiders upon them. I The Peirce who is familiar to readers of his published writings is usually the mathematical logician and student of scientific method. But his scientific interests seem to have been subordinate to a far- flung metaphysics, and the substantial part of Volume I is devoted to an analysis and a speculative use of the categories. He desired to draw up a list of fundamental categories such that for a long future the intellectual achievements of man would appear simply as corroborative details, and one of his earliest published papers was already concerned with this task. Unfortunately, Peirce had a fond- ness for trichotomous divisions, and so he recognized just three fundamental categories: Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness. But Secondness is analyzable into two species, the second of which is again divisible into two species, and so on; while Thirdness is analyzable into three kinds, the second of which is divisible into two varieties, and so on, and the third of which is divisible into three varieties, etc. His thought appears in a very artificial form indeed, although he had enough sense of humor to see how crack-brained his triadic scheme must appear to the general reader (1.364).3 Peirce has not definitely stated what status he assigns to the categories. But they are frequently proposed as the directly appre- hended logical simples into which the complexity of whatever is pre- sented may be analyzed. For his object is to establish a science of phaneroscopy (phenomenolooy) which would describe the total of whatever is present to the mind in any way (phaneron), irrespective 2 He supplied one manuscript with the following heading: "Notes for a Book, to be entitled 'A Guess at the Riddle,' with a Vignette of the Sphynx below the Title. And this book, if ever written, as it soon will be if I am in a situation to do it, will be one of the births of time." 3 The references are to volume and paragraph.</page><page sequence="3">PEIRCE'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE 367 of the "realities" to which the phanerons correspond or of their physical and psychological conditions (1.287).4 Now the study of the phaneron, Peirce claims, shows it to contain three indecompos- able elements or aspects, which are the three categories. But he was careful to point out that these elements are not existentially sep- arate, and that their analysis consists only in tracing out the rela- tions between features isolated logically (1.294). The elements of the phaneron are indecomposable, because they show no differences in internal logical structure, although there are differences in the structure of their possible compounds (1.288, 1.291). The cate- gories seem to be, therefore, factors continually present in all expe- rience (1.134), and indissolubly intertwined with one another. We may distinguish the factors from one another, but we can not, eveni in imagination, dissociate them from one another or from other con- ceptions. We may indeed prescind or suppose some from the others in the same way as we prescind or suppose space from color (1.353); but we must never regard them as atoms out of which anything is constructed, since they are always only distinctions in everything presented (1.286). Although the categories primarily characterize the phaneron, Peirce also regards them as representing congenital tendencies of the mind, and admits that so far he agrees with Kant. But he makes a careful study of the facts in various fields in order to confirm the pervasiveness of three modes of being (1.374); for he regards the list of categories as "a table of conceptions drawn from the logical analysis of thought and regarded as applicable to being" (1.300). It is difficult to evaluate his performance, since the analogies he finds between features in different subject-matters are very tenuous, the argument is often post hoc, and he himself points out in one case at least that the categories he finds in one domain do not correspond precisely with those in another (1.452). He uses (and thereby abuses) propositions in the general theory of conics to illustrate fundamental metaphysical distinctions, and the outcome is very mystifying metaphysics indeed (1.362). Finally, it must be remem- bered that Peirce admits his triad of categories does not exhaust all the categories (1.525), so that there is reason to suppose that his predilection for trichotomies was nurtured by his studies in the logic of relations; although what the intimate connection is between these studies and his metaphysics Peirce leaves the reader to guess at random. 4 This approach has many obvious affiliations with the "presupposition- less ' studies of essences by Descartes, Husserl, and Santayana, although in the light of Peirce 's devastating critique of the Augustinian-Cartesian philosophy in his earliest papers, too much can not be made of this similarity. And after the nature of Thirdness has been discussed it will be seen how full of presuppositions Peirce 's analysis really is.</page><page sequence="4">368 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Let us turn to the categories themselves. The Category of First- ness indicates the aspect of freshness, life, freedom, variety, and spontaneity in the phaneron. Thus it would seem that Firstness presents the phase of atomicity, specificity, or sheer quality in ex- perience. A quality is just what it is, and in its sheer immediacy is utterly disconnected with any other quality. On the other hand Peirce regards Firstness as a "pure nature" or quality to which embodiment and localization are essentially foreign (1.303). A quality is eternal, independent of time or of any realization (1.420); it is simply a "may-be," whose nature is that it might be a specific moment in a phaneron. Nevertheless Firstness is not a general or universal, since to be a universal involves reference to embodiment and localization (1.304). It is not easy to reconcile these various characterizations of First- ness. Peirce seems to shuttle back and forth between regarding First- ness as the absolutely specific, immediate quality in the phaneron, as a determination which is not an "abstract suchness" (1.303, 1.306) on the one hand; and on the other hand, regarding Firstness as pure potentials, involving a variety and spontaneity which "is not defi- nitely there," mere "may-bes" not necessarily realized (1.373). He thus alternates between conceiving Firstness as being simply a dis- tinction within the phaneron, and conceiving it as a disembodied but substantial essence. Firstness is at the same time a mere "possibil- ity " and the element of spontaneity; it is declared to lack generality, and also to be of the nature of a general, capable of further de- terminations (1.447). Peirce himself acknowledged that "possibil- ity" was a misnomer for firstness, since it mistakenly suggested a relation to what exists (1.531). But he adds a final touch to these confusions when he identifies Firstness or quality, not with immediate, physically inefficacious quality, nor with an abstract isolated pos- sibility, but with the power bodies have of determining future mani- festations of inefficacious qualities (1.422). Firstness is then con- ceived as a dynamic relation, and so an element of law or regularity (Thirdness) is introduced into what started out to be the element of spontaneity. Further difficulties arise when the connection of qualities with feelings is examined. A feeling for Peirce is an element of imme- diate consciousness, a quality of it which is not an event (1.306); and a quality in general is something which is vivid and conscious (1.357). There is thus a tendency to identify qualities with f eel- ings, and so it is only a short step to impute feelings to whatever has qualities, for example, to inorganic matter. Indeed, "dead matter" can excite feelings in us, only because dead matter isn't dead at all (1.311). Consequently, Peirce must be included among those who</page><page sequence="5">PEIRCE'S GUESSES AT TILE RIDDLE 369 use with abandon an uncritically formulated principle of continuity. Like can come only from the like, and so the qualities which humans enjoy are communicable and find their counterparts in non-human situations. "I am confident," Peirce declares, "that a bull and I feel much alike at the sight of a red rag" (1.314). Far be it from me to question this assertion, especially since I do not know what it means. I do not see, however, how it and similar statements are reconcilable with Peirce's logical pragmatism. He himself declared that in immediate experience there is no knowledge, so that if First- ness indicates the element of spontaneity, every description must be false to it (1.357). And I think this is true, because of that which is wholly immediate nothing whatsoever can be said, for the simple reason that the wholly immediate is not the subject-matter for any saying. We turn to the second category. Secondness indicates the ele- ment of brute fact, struggle, actuality. It points to fact, within which distinct elements stand in opposition to one another, for all existence is always a matter of blind force. Facts are determinate with respect to every character. They involve physical things act- ing upon one another hic et ntnc; these physical things are the sum of all the consequences of their so acting here and now. But Peirce points out that the individual mode of behavior indicated by Second- ness is not determined by any law (1.440); a stone falling here and now is not made to do so by any law of nature (1.323). Hence the proposition that every event is precisely determined must be aban- doned, since it is only approximately true (1.402). Secondness thus points to the element of contingency, of some- thing "accidently actual" in the phaneron (1.427). Peirce would have been sympathetic with recent attempts to revive causality as a distinct category not analyzable into uniform succession (1.325). For Secondness denotes a necessity which is natural, and also uncon- ditional, forceful, ultimate, a quality of operative events. At the same time, Secondness points to a radical indeterminism in the be- havior of nature, so that Peirce anticipated in general outline the statistical interpretation of natural laws. Unfortunately, but perhaps inevitably, Peirce 's discussion of Secondness is almost entirely in anthropomorphic language. We may cite as examples his characterization of fact as something which "fights its way into existence; for it exists by virtue of the opposi- tions which it involves" (1.432) ; and "the existence of facts consists in fight" (1.435). This anthropomorphism Peirce often regards as a virtue, and once again a principle of continuity is employed to read strife, struggle, effort, which are features of human life, as generic traits of all nature. But where shall one draw the line-why not</page><page sequence="6">370 JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY read desire, revulsion, love, into every nook and cranny of the world as well? Peirce, like many contemporary thinkers, did not hesitate at times to draw just such conclusions. Now the world may, in- deed, be populated with many more qualities than we ordinarily sup- pose. But why should we uncritically admit them, at the behest of a dubiously stated principle of continuity? Why should we over- look the fact that the qualities we experience are functions, in part at least, of the interaction of our own bodies with the rest of nature, and that they can not therefore be imputed to segments of the world where such interaction is not going on? An equally serious shortcoming is Peircee's failure to analyze the meaning of contingency, and to state how he conceives an event to exhibit a contingent aspect and also to illustrate a uniformity. Is the contingency of an event an absolute character of it, an im- mediate quality of a hic et nunc operation; is it a relational char- acter, so that an event has a contingent aspect with respect to one set of circumstances but not to another set; is it synonymous with the sheer plurality and variety of things; or is it all these things and something else besides? This problem is especially important for Peirce, because as we shall see, uniformity is taken by him as a temporally derivative character of events. Let us examine the final category. The category of Thirdness introduces the element of determination by law. A law is the mode of being which consists in future facts (of Secondness) taking on determinate general characters (1.26); a law is how an endless future must continue to be (1.536). Thus, Thirdness involves the idea of something general, which can not ever be completely ac- tualized and so refers to an indefinite future. Thirdness or law, according to Peirce, is akin to thought; it can be produced and grow, it can be communicated and is general. It addresses itself to two realms: as general, it concerns itself with the realm of possi- bility or quality; as factual, it refers to the actual world (1.420). Since Thirdness is involved in all communication, the correct analy- sis of the category leads inevitably to the study of the nature of signs. But we will examine this aspect of the matter in the next section. At this point, let us see the use Peirce makes of his categories in his cosmogonical speculations. According to him, every sound meta- physics must be evolutionary. This dictum is based largely on the further dictum that what needs to be explained is not the variety, freshness, and unpredictability of things, but the uniformities which they exhibit. Uniformity must be "explained" by showing how, out of a primal spontaneity, together with a tendency in the flux to take on habits, laws or habits have evolved (1.175). In a sense,</page><page sequence="7">PEIRCE'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE 371 therefore, Thirdness is not as "ultimate" a category as Firstness, since regularity grows out of pure chance or Firstness (1.407). In the infinitely distant past there was no law, only chaos together with a tendency toward uniformity or the elimination of inde- terminacy (1.409). Hence the three active elements in the universe are chance, law, and the tendency for things to take on habits. Is it possible to make a coherent scheme out of all this? In the first place, let us recall that the categories should be regarded as distinctions within the phaneron, not as active elements out of which whatever exists is to be constructed. However, if we also recall that phaneroscopy has nothing to do with the question of how far the phaneron corresponds to any reality, what meaning shall we assign to Secondness and Thirdness which specificially involve ref- erence to the actual world? Can anyone, least of all Peirce, main- tain that the nature of law is to be learned independently of the operations of "real" beings and of the use of the discursive methods of the sciences? Indeed, if there is nothing in immediate conscious- ness except feeling or quality (1.317), how can the phaneron ex- hibit elements of Secondness and Thirdniess? Peirce himself declares that law unrealized is merely a pure first, a quality possessed, and is not a "genuine" law. Secondly, is the idea of law as something active anything other than Plotinian and Schellingian poetry? It is true that Peirce calls Thirdness a law only when we, contemplate it from the outside, while if "we see both sides" it shows itself to be akin to thought (1.420). But change of terminology does not always solve a difficulty, and Peirce does not show how the radical indeterminacy of fact is com- patible with the activity of thought or law in determining what future facts are to be. Thirdly, what is to be said for the dictum that uniformities, and only uniformities, require explanation? Is it not patent that we sometimes seek to explain a regularity and at other times the lack of regularity? For what, anyway, is an explanation? Is it not the case that we "explain" an event or law when we exhibit it as an element in a more comprehensive order or uniformity? Thus we explain why a glass breaks when hot water is poured into it, by showing that types of relations, like the flow of heat, the elasticity of a substance, and the unequal expansion of a substance, are ex- hibited in the explicandum. These types, if they are to explain, must be pervasive modes of behavior, must be what are called " regularities." Peirce himself is compelled to take note of them. He can not possibly get order and connection by simply taking them as growths from a primal chaos; he must take for granted some form of order, e.g., a tendency in things to take on and conserve</page><page sequence="8">372 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY habits. For the hypothetical chaos is completely unintelligible, and can not be the explanation of anything. One may explain a specific law by showing it to be the consequence of a more inclusive order. But one can not explain order as such, since it is the principle of explanation of everything else. What order we take as primary in any inquiry depends upon the state of our knowledge and the de- mands of the problem; some order we must assume, just as some plurality must be taken for granted if anything is to be explained. Peirce was motivated in his cosmogony by a bias toward a spiritual- istic interpretation of the cosmos, and by an understandable reaction to philosophies of his day which attempted to derive the variety of things from a primal homogeneity. The moral is that it is just as much a mistake to deny an ultimate specificity and variety, as it is to deny an inexpugnable order. It is instructive to compare Peirce with Spinoza. Both recognized nature to possess a structure and also to contain an inexhaustible variety. Peirce chose to emphasize the latter and to regard the former as derivative. But I think Spinoza was both sounder and wiser when he included in Part I of the Ethics Prop. 15 as well as Prop. 28. Finally, one must seriously question Peirce's facile reduction of laws of nature to "habits." No doubt there is an analogy, often a fruitful one, and no suggestive hypothesis should be neglected. But do we know the nature of human habits so well that we can pretend to throw light on the nature of laws by using the former to explain the latter? What real evidence is there for Peirce's assumption that natural laws are like habits which human beings take on and occasionally drop? It is true that almost all our scientific terms, even the most neutral ones, are infected with meanings carried over from the specifically human scene. But this should not be taken as a license to exercise one's speculative fancy and so regard proc- esses in all parts of nature as simply human processes writ large. The issue is not between affirming inumutable laws of nature and affirming the contrary. The flux is what it is, and why should a naturalist on a priori grounds deny anything of it? But whatever the flux is, the issue is to examine any allegation concerning it with scrupulous care, in philosophy 'as well as in science. And if it is alleged that laws grow and change, while at the same time laws are not identified with any segment of the flux, especial care should be taken to determine the sense in which laws "change," considering that change is taken as a fundamental character of the flux itself. II Although the triad of categories is a persistant melody running through most of Peirce's writings, many of his doctrines can be</page><page sequence="9">PEIRCE'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE 373 understood better in connection with his theory of signs. The magnificent series of papers in the Joutrnal of Speculative Philoso- phy, in which he broke with the Cartesian tradition dominating modern philosophy, was inspired by his recognition of the function of signs in thought. Like Aristotle, Peirce was impressed by the fact that language is the medium in which the rationality of the world becomes expressed and communicated; and he went so far as to say that "the woof and warp of all thought and all research is synmbols, and the life of thought and science is the life inherent in symbols" (2.220). "My language," he declared, "is the sum total of myself, for the man is the thought. The identity of man consists in the consistency of what he does and thinks, and consistency is the intellectual character of a thing, i.e., is its expressing something." Representation or the operation of signs (mediation or Thirdness) is therefore one of the fundamental categories, and to its study Peirce devoted his best energy. Peirce's ideas on signs are the most difficult and obscure of all he set down on paper. Only a meager outline is here attempted. Anything whatsoever (e.g., physical object, image, quality, thought) may be a sign, so that signs differ from one another in several im- portant ways. But in any case, every sign involves a triadic rela- tion. For in every case where a sign functions, there is first, the sign with its own material quality; secondly, there is the object of which it is a sign, and which it represents in some respect (the ground); and thirdly, there is the thought to which it is addressed, the interpretant to which it is a sign. In Volume II Peirce dis- cusses each one of these three aspects of the sign, each aspect yield- ing three divisions.5 And first, when we attend to the material quality of signs, we find three types: a sign may be a pure quality or possibility, some- thing which as a pure quality is disembodied, even though it can not actually function as a sign until embodied (a qualisign) ; or it may be an actual existent, a physical thing or event (a sinsign); or finially, it may be a general law, rule, or habit (a legisign). Every sinsign clearly must involve qualisigns, while every legisign func- tions through sinsigns which are instances or "replicas " of it. Thus, in one sense, each time "three " occurs on a page there is a distinct word, each being a sinsign; but in another sense, these distinct sinsigns stand for the very same word (legisign), which is a general rule or convention for the production of sinsigns. All conventional marks are signs not because they can be seen or touched, but because they are replicas of a type which signifies through its instances (2.244). 5 In a later volume he will distinguish ten trichotomous divisions, giving sixty-six independent classes of signs.</page><page sequence="10">374 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Secondly, when the sign is studied witlh respect to the relation between it and its object, the following three types are found: a sign is an icon when it refers to an object because of its own in- trinsic features, which nevertheless it possesses in common with its object (e.g., a diagram or picture) ; it is an index when it is really (dynamically) affected by its object (e.g., a street cry, the rolling gait of a man as a sign of his being a sailor, or a weather-cock) ; it is a symbol, when it operates to be interpreted by virtue of a law or association of general ideas (e.g., a proposition, all conventional signs). Peirce regarded this as the most important division of signs. The only way we have of communicating and thinking, ac- cording to him, is by means of direct or indirect use of icons (2.278). But icons generally function as constituents of indices, which in turn are constituents of symbols; and symbols, being general, in- volve laws referring to the indefinite future, and so require legi- signs and sinsigns to function (2.293). Thirdly, when the sign is examined with respect to what its interpretant understands it to represent, the following three types are found: when the sign is taken as representing a kind of possible object or quality, when it represents an object merely with respect to its characters, it is a rheme (in modern terminology, a proposi- tional function) ; when it is taken as a sign of actual existence, when it represents its objects with respect to the actual existence of the object, it is a dicisign; when it is taken as a sign of law or regular- ity, it is an argument (2.25.2). If we combine these three sets of distinctions in all possible ways, we get twenty-seven (i.e., 33) classes of signs, only ten of which are independent. Peirce discusses them with great subtlety. We can not report his analyses, but turn instead to some of the applications he makes of his studies on the role of signs in discursive reasoning. (a) The nature of meaning. It is not intended to add here an- other specimen to the sixteen meanings of "meaning" captured by Ogden and Richards. I only wish to point out that most analyses of meaning have gone off the track because they identify meaning with some essense, image, or thought, instead of studying the struc- ture of the situations in which meanings occur. Peirce's discussion of signs should make us aware that "meaning" is a triadic relation involving a sign, its object, and its interpreter, so that an exclusive concentration upon one of these terms must of necessity yield an inadequate analysis of the nature of meaning. It may be thought that the specific introduction of the interpreter as a factor in the analysis of meaning, involves the introduction of irrelevant psy- chology which will only becloud a very beclouded problem. But quite the contrary is the case. For this analysis isolates the differ-</page><page sequence="11">PEIRCE'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE 375 ent factors in a meaning situation, allows us to explore the general conditions under which signs may adequately represent their ob- jects irrespective of any specific interpreter, and then emphasizes the ineradicable role of the interpreter. Thus we can discover that a sign must be a "logical map" or icon of its object if it is to represent it adequately; and we can also consider the social factors which enter into the activities of the interpreter which determine how he interprets signs, without however altering the validity of the first analysis. Meanings are not qualities or essences; they are the structure of certain situations in which such triadic relations are exhibited. Consider, furthermore, the problem as to the nature of proposi- tions. A proposition is sometimes identified with judgment, under- stood as a psychological act; sometimes with a fact or state of affairs; sometimes with a substantial, non-temporal, non-spatial entity or essence; sometimes with a sentence in all its particularity. Peirce, on the other hand, is able to avoid both the hypostasis and the psychologizing of propositions by analyzing them as dicent sym- bols which are legisigns. Hence a proposition is a sign, and requires a three-fold reference: it is a sign which is connected with its ob- ject by an association of general ideas; it is dynamically connected with its object if it is true, and is interpreted as representing a situation located in the realm investigated; and it also has a de- terminate material quality, determined by a general rule or con- vention, so that "cogito" and "1 think" stand for the same propo- sition. It is also relevant to mention in this connection that most of the recent work in symbolic logic has devoted exclusive attention to the iconic feature of signs, and has neglected their very important indexical, symbolical, and argumentative aspects. The dissatisfac- tion which many philosophers have felt with symbolic logic may perhaps be explained on this ground. And it is not too much to say that an adequate philosophy of logic will not be achieved until the neglected features of signs receive a complete study. (b) The doctrine of fallibilism. Every sign addresses itself to some thought or interpreter, and this in turn, according to Peirce, is a sign, which must address itself to another thought, and so on without limit. This indicates the nature of all discursive thought, and it is largely for this reason that he denied knowledge to be immediate apprehension. All cognition requires mediation, inter- pretation, and reference to an indefinite future. There can be no absolute finality or complete certitude, since the process of inter- pretation is an unlimited one. The method of science is self-correc- tive. We can not doubt all things at once; but without being</page><page sequence="12">376 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY dogmatic or sceptical, we can construct hypotheses, submit them to empirical tests, reconsider the hypotheses and tests in terms of other hypotheses and observations, and so on endlessly. Thus while the sciences aim at exactitude, universality, and complete certitude, these are ideal limits which they can never reach, and which it is suicidal for them to claim to have reached. All our knowledge, in the natural sciences as well as in mathematics, is fallible. The import of this doctrine will be clearer if we bear in mind that the complete certitude Peirce denies we can attain, is not a psychological state of strong conviction, but is a complete logical ground for the propositions we assert. The following considera- tions will bear this out. (1) Peirce makes clear that it is the fallibility of discursive thought which he is asserting, and that he is not denying the im- mediacy of direct experience. Kant 's sharp distinction between observation and reflection he believes is mistaken, because all sig- nificant observation involves interpretation, so that reasoning does not begin after observation is over (1.35). The consequences of this criticism, as everyone knows, are momentous for the theory of science. And he has a crushing retort to those who claim absolute certainty for the objects of direct experience: "Direct experience is neither certain nor uncertain, because it affirms nothing-it just is. . . It involves no error, because it testifies to nothing but its own appearance. For the same reason, it affords no certainty" (1.145). (2) The claim to infallibility is only a hindrance to inquiry, since what we want to know concerning any proposition is whether it is well supported by evidence. The claim to finality, however, con- fuses the question of the logical value of the evidence with the question as to the psychological certitude we may possess. Accord- ingly, since the first rule of reason is "Do not block the way of inquiry" (1.135), we may dismiss as obstacles the claims that we have absolute certitude, that there is something we can never know, that something or other is basic or absolutely simple, and that some law or other has received its perfect formulation. (3) It is a very crude analysis which declares that things are sharply cut off from one another, like the traditional pictures of atoms as billiard balls. The contrary is the case, according to Peirce, for "all things swim in continua. " Our concepts, too, shade off into penumbral regions of indeterminacy, so that our knowledge "swims in a continuum of uncertainty and indetermi- nacy'" (1.171). Hence the "laws of nature" must be interpreted as describing the approximate behavior of large groups, and do not describe without serious qualifications the behavior of their in- dividual members (1.156).</page><page sequence="13">PEIRCE'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE 377 (4) A pragmatic theory of meaning involves an implicit ref- erence to the future in every judgment about matters of fact. To call a piece of stone hard, is to predict how it will behave and what effects it will have in the future (1.615). Hence every present judg- ment is subject to correction, since it involves an endless series of verifications. Science is therefore not so much a body of estab- lished truth, as a diligent search or process of inquiry into truth (1.44). Against the doctrine of fallibilism many thinkers will no doubt raise the objection that we can not be said to "know," unless what we know is in fact the case. Anyone claiming to "know" that the earth is flat, it will be said, claims what is false, for we could know that proposition to be true only if the earth were indeed flat. Hence, if there is such a thing as knowledge, it must be absolutely certain; on Peirce's view, however, it will be urged, we may have opinion and belief, but never authentic knowledge, since knowledge is not subject to revision. To this objection there is only one reply. Knowledge so defined that when we have it we can not possibly be in error, is the ideal goal to which we strive; but it is Peirce's claim that we have not yet anything to illustrate such a knowledge beyond every possible doubt. It may well be that certain propositions claimed as knowledge will never be significantly challenged. The indubility that attaches to such propositions comes, however, not from any analysis of the nature of knowledge nor from a psychologi- cal sense of certitude, but from the fact that they are supported by evidence overwhelming logically. Nevertheless, in all discursive thinking there is always the possibility that we are mistaken in what we allege to know. There are therefore no ultimate first principles intuitively reached which are the bed-rock of all certitude. There is only science as a self-corrective process, steering midway between a stultifying scepticism and an unimaginative dogmatism. (c) Logic and mathematics. But what does Peirce do with logic and mathematics, it will be asked. Can he successfully ex- tend the principle of fallibilism to apply to them? The attempt to do so is indeed one of the most interesting features of Peirce's writ- ings on logic; and it merits careful study because he was bitterly hostile to the psychologizing logicians of his day. Logic in its broadest sense is understood by him to be general semeiotic, or the science of what must be and ought to be the nature of true representations or signs (1.444, 1.539). Logic is thus in- extricably related to language. Corresponding to the three-fold nature of signs, it has three departments: critical logic, the theory of the conditions for the truth of signs; speculative grammar, the theory of the nature of signs in all their aspects; and speculative</page><page sequence="14">378 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY rhetoric, or the theory of the conditions of reference of signs to their interpretants (2.93). The content of speculative grammar has already been indicated; and apparently Peirce wrote nothing systematically on speculative rhetoric, in spite of his belief that general methods could be stated for attacking the solution of prob- lems (2.108). There remains to indicate something concerning the nature of critical logic. The task of critical logic is the classification of arguments with respect to the form of their constituent propositions and the fre- quency with which true premisses of a determinate type yield true conclusions. Each argument requires a habit of inference, which when formulated is the leading principle or canon of that type of argument. These habits are general since they refer to an indefinite future, and in a determinate class of arguments commit us to few or no false conclusions (2.148, 2.446). Some leading principles are perfectly general or formal: they are involved in every set of premisses, and are the logical principles par excellence; others have a more restricted generality, and are material principles (2.466, 2.589). The consequences of taking leading principles or generalized habits as the basis for valid inference are many. It enables Peirce to supply an objective, matter-of-fact foundation for all inference, and so indicate the relevance of material considerations in formal logic. The naturalistic strain in him shows itself at its best in his discussions of the metaphysical grounds of logical canons of infer- ence (2.710ff). It also enables him to treat in a unified manner both necessary and probable reasoning, since the former is a limiting case of the latter when the leading principles employed have rela- tive truth-frequencies whose values are always unity (2.696). It permits him to do justice to the purely mechanical element in in- ference, and admit that logical machines perform inferences even though they do not think (2.59). And it permits him to avoid a crude empiricism with respect to logic, by associating the canons of deductive or explicative inference with the analysis of signs, so that he can retain his naturalism and still admit that the experi- ential element in logic is all but nil (2.65). Nevertheless, not everything that Peirce says about inference is crystal clear or consistent. There remains an unbridgeable gap between probable and necessary reasoning which he reluctantly admits when he asserts that a class of arguments whose relative truth-frequency is unity, does not therefore belong to the class of necessary inferences (2.369). And when he asserts that the proc- ess of substitution, so vital in formal reasoning, is non-inferential, simply because the propositional forms employed have no specific</page><page sequence="15">PEIRCE'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE 379 meaning or reference, he exhibits serious limitations in his under- standing of the distinctive marks of inference (2.496). Let us turn, however, to his analysis of deductive reasoning and to the incidence of the doctrine of fallibilism upon it. We can best do this in connection with his discussion of mathematical reasoning. Peirce was profoundly influenced by F. A. Lange's Logische Studien and always maintained that both logic and mathematics were "ob- servational sciences." This aperQu depends on recognizing that all reasoning is by means of and upon signs. In mathematics, for exam- ple, we construct a diagram (i.e., any complex sign) according to a general rule; we observe relations between parts of the diagram not stated explicitly by the rule; we show that the diagram is a fair sample of all the diagrams determined by the rule, so that these rela- tions hold always (or at least in a certain proportion of cases) for any such diagram; and finally we state these relations in general terms as the necessary (or probable) conclusion of the investigation 6 (1.54, 1.66). In the sense, therefore, that explicative reasoning is diagrammatic, it requires observation, since we must construct dia- grams, at least in imagination, and observe them (1.240); and it will be seen that the discussion does not depend on the status of the controversy between opponents and defenders of "imageless think- ing." Hence, mathematics is no more infallible than other positive sciences of observation, and every mathematical inference is accord- ingly a matter of probability (1.248, 2.192) even though it may be beyond every reasonable doubt. Whatever else may be said of this extension of the principle of fallibilism to mathematics, Peirce has rendered a service in pointing out how insecure logically are all claims for the self-evidence of mathematical propositions. The history of logic and mathematics amply bears out the substance of Peirce's warnings against an arro- gant infallibilism; it shows that here as elsewhere, general principles are but slowly apprehended, require to be carefully tested out, and the limits of their application are never completely free from doubt. Nevertheless, there is a good deal of confusion in his contention that mathematical reasoning is "probable." His illustrations indicate that he means by that characterization simply that we, and thousands of others, may have blundered in adding a column of figures or in deducing the consequences of a set of premisses. But there is an im- portant difference between the assertion that "7 + 5 -12" is only 6 In this emphasis upon the role of diagrams Peirce anticipated much of the mathematical philosophy of Hilbert, although his motivation is clearly different. Like Hilbert, he denies that mathematics ever requires the aid of logic (1.247, 2.191), although this dictum seems to depend upon his taking "logic" in this context to be a science of fact, and not the formal science of the consequences of hypotheses.</page><page sequence="16">380 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY probable because we may have erred, and the assertion that "all men are mortal" is probable because the evidence from bio-chemistry and physiology is incomplete and because there is a reference to a contingent future. In the first case we are dealing, with the connee- tion of relations having the utmost generality possible and not sub- ject to change; in the second, the subject-matter is a segment of an incompletely determined flux. And Peirce himself, as we shall see, stood out firmly against confusing probability with ignorance. Peirce's views as to the nature of mathematics are amazingly up to date. He saw clearly that pure mathematics is a hypothetico- deductive science, that it does not make categorical assertions about what exists (1.53), and that all a priori arguments about matters of fact are just rubbish (2.137). But he did not always see the impli- cations of these insights. Thus he thinks that "two straight lines can have only one intersection" is an evident proposition (1.130), and that the postulates of geometry are only approximately true (1.131). He can not therefore be regarded as having anticipated Poineare and Duhem in their profound studies on the conneetion between applied mathematics and physics. (d) Nominalism. It is clear from what precedes that Peirce (could not agree with those for whom the only mode of being is that of individual objects which crowd out a place for themselves by sheer force. Such a view he characterized as nominalism, and he called himself a realist because he recognized the mode of being of law or Thirdness. Peirce takes great pains to make clear that by a law or universal he did not mean a "thing" or a "particular." When a man believes that the property hardness is not invented by men as the word "hard" is, he says, "but is really and truly in the hard things and is one in them all, as a description of habit, disposition, or behavior, then he is a realist" (1.27n). The mode of being a law consists in the fact that future acts will take on a determinate general char- acter. Whatever is general, is something which is the object, not the creature of thought. And it can not be identified with any finite set of particulars, since "its being is in the instances which it will determine " (2.249). Peirce's realism is thus of the "moderate" kind. Universals or laws are not capable of localization in space and time, not something added to the particulars so localized. They are the modes of behavior and the relations between modes of behavior of things in space and time. In spite of his flirting with the idea of "pure possibilities," in spite of his saying that a typical mathematician must be a Plato- nist for whom the universe of "actual" existence is but an arbitrary locus in the eternal, the substance of his reflections on universals is</page><page sequence="17">PEIRCE'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE 381 to tie them indissolubly to the flux of things. The supposition of universals with no reference to the flux is as meaningless as the sup- position of a flux which did not embody universals (2.330). But there is no doubt Peirce was not always faithful to his best insights into this matter. Most puzzling is his philandering with the idea of final causes, so that he sometimes thinks of laws and ideas as operative and efficient. Thus, he declares that when an idea is communicated "it had caused something to happen in your brain" (1.213); that while heredity is a law and not a force, it "like other laws doubtless avails itself of forces" (1.215); and that "every general idea has more or less power of working itself out into facts" (2.149). These expressions may be simply metaphors. It is, how- ever, a metaphor which strangely persists in much of the discussion of Thirdness, and must make Peirce's readers question the integrity of his realism. For to endow laws with efficacy is to particularize them into things, and is an invitation to the nominalist to ask his unanswerable "When? Where ?"' Nor is the reader 's doubt allayed when Peirce permits himself to say that the number system is our own creation, and that mathematical reasoning holds simply because it deals only with the creations of the mind (1.149, 2.192). It is a high price, even for fallibilism, to explain the unusual logical cer- tainty of mathematics by regarding its subject-matter to be nothing more than an entertaining convention. III Peirce was justly proud of his having been brought up in the laboratory and of so having acquired the experimental frame of mind when still young. And indeed his best developed writings are the contributions to the theory of deduction and to the analysis of prob- able reasoning. The substance of his discussions of scientific method centers around his perception that science is more sure of the correctness of the general procedures it employs than it is of any specific result achieved by them. Those procedures involve the specific application of a self-corrective hypothetico-deductive method, and Peirce was convinced of the universal applicability of that method. He was eager to defend it against all comers, like a knight his fair lady whom he has chosen from all the world. He could, therefore, consistently attack the positivists for their doctrine that all hypotheses must be capable of direct verification (2.511n), and also declare that the full meaning of a proposition is to be found in what it prescribes us to do to gain perceptual experience (2.330). Even without waiting for his complete writings on pragmatism, which will appear in later vol- umes, it is possible to form a fair estimate of the studies on scientific method contained in these volumes.</page><page sequence="18">382 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Peirce made much of the distinction between explicative and ampliative reasoning. Explicative reasoning is either necessary or probable, ampliative reasoning either inductive or presumptive. We have already considered the main features of the first, and shall return below to a more careful analysis of probable inferences. What is ampliative reasoning? In general, says Peirce, it is such that "the facts summed up in the conclusion are not among those stated in the premisses. They are different facts, as when one sees that the tide rises m times and concludes that it will rise the next time. These are the only inferences which increase our real knowledge, however useful the others may be" (2.680). But let us see what its species are. Induction consists in inferring the constitution of a class from the constitution of samples drawn from it. We determine by in- duction the nature of a cargo of wheat through judicious sampling; this process determines for us, by empirical means, the ratio with which certain characters occur. Presumptive reasoning, on the other hand (also called abduction, retroduction, hypothesis), consists in inferring an explanation, cause, or hypothesis from some fact which can be taken as a consequence of the hypothesis. Presumptive reasoning is therefore the provisional adoption of a hypothesis, be- cause every possible consequence of it is capable of verification, so that by pursuing this method its disagreements with facts will be revealed (1.68). The difference between induction and presumption is that the former infers the existence of phenomena homogeneous to those already observed, while in the latter something heterogeneous to that already observed is concluded, even something impossible for us to observe directly (2.640). Now Peirce believes that these forms of inference are different from explicative probable reasoning, which he also calls statistical deduction. For the latter is probable, as we shall see more fullv below, in the sense that though in a particular case its conclusion is false, yet in the long run and with a definite ratio, similar con- clusions would be approximately true. But induction, for example, is probable only in the sense that though it may give a false con- clusion, yet in the long run where the same process is used, a differ- ent but approximately true conclusion would be drawn (2.703). Thus, in probable reasoning the predicted conclusion is verified in the long run in a definite ratio of all the cases; in ampliative reason- ing, the predicted conclusion will be changed in a good proportion of the cases, but will become approximately correct in the long ran (2.709). But it can be shown that the distinction between statistical deduc- tion and the species of ampliative reasoning is only a psychological</page><page sequence="19">PEIR2;CE'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE 383 one, and refers simply to the various degrees of completeness our knowledge may possess. The distinction does not touch the logical question as to the validity of these forms of inference. For consider: If we reason at all, we must reason from premisses, and if we reason validly we do so because the conclusion is obtained in accordance with the leading principle or canon of the argument. When Peirce asks how it is possible that a man can observe one fact and then pro- nounce judgment concerning another fact not involved in the first, and when he then adds that such reasoning has no definite probabil- ity (2.690), he is surely inconsistent with his own analysis. If the inference is made in virtue of some leading principle, it does have some degree of probability, namely, the relative truth-frequency as- sociated with that principle. If the "inference" does not involve a leading principle, no reasoning takes place in any usual sense of the word. Thus, I sample a bag of beans and find half the sample is white. If I know nothing concerning the representative nature of the sample, I can conclude nothing about the color of the beans in the bag, although I may make a guess, consider my guess a hypothe- sis, and then proceed to test the hypothesis in the usual way. But if I do know that samples drawn in the way I drew this one are repre- sentative of the beans in the bag, I can conclude something about the constitution of the bag by statistical deduction; and the argument is probable in the sense to be defined presently. Ampliative inference is thus the experimental process by which we determine approxi- mately the numerical values of the relative truth-frequencies in- volved. But as Peirce himself admits, its species are inverse forms of deductive probable inference, and their validity (the only rele- vant question in logic) is the validity of statistical deductions (2.511, 2.718). We need discuss therefore only the theory of deductive probabil- ity, which Peirce adopted from Venn and developed in an original way.7 The following are its essential features: (1) Probable infer- ence, like all inference, depends for its validity upon determinate relations between propositions. (2) No proposition is probable in- trinsically, but only with respect to other propositions which are evidence for it. Probability is thus a relation between propositions. (3) Whether a proposition has or has not a degree of probability on definite evidence, does not depend on the state of mind of the person entertaining the proposition. Psychology is as little (or as much) relevant in probable inference as it is in necessary inference. (4) An inference is probable in so far as it belongs to a class of in- 7 A rigorously systematic discussion of the theory was never given by Peirce. It has been left for German students (Von Mises, Reichenbach, Tornier) to discover independently the fundamental principles of the truth-frequency theory.</page><page sequence="20">384 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ferences in which the frequency of the conclusions being true is a determinate ratio of the frequency of the premisses being true. Prob- ability is the limiting value of the fraction whose numerator is the number of times both antecedent and consequent are true and whose denominator is the number of times the antecedent is true, as the number increases without limit. Hence probability is not, as on Keynes' view, an unanalyzable concept. (5) The same proposition may have different degrees of probability in accordance with the sort of evidence which is marshalled in its support. But the relevance of the evidence can not be determined on formal grounds alone. It is clear that since probability is the limit of an endless series, we can never assert categorically the value of a probability. Hence the assertion that such and such is the probability of a proposition is always a hypothesis, always subject to correction. And hence, also, the sole business of the experimental sciences, since we can not ex- haustively study all of nature, is to carry on sampling operations which will indicate approximately the values of different probabili- ties. The question remains, therefore, under what conditions the proc- ess of sampling will lead us to an approximately true knowledge of the constitution of a field. Peirce prepares his reader by first re- jecting in toto all theories of probability which are based upon the principle of equal distribution of ignorance; second (this is a corol- lary from the first) rejecting the use of inverse probabilities; and third, denying that the validity of sampling depends on any mate- rial assumptions such as the uniformity of nature (2.102, 2.749). According to him, sampling is a valid process whatever be the con- stitution of the universe, since its validity follows from the manner in which the sampling is conducted. And the following are the conditions under which sampling is a reliable process: first, the sub- ject-matter must have a determinate nature; second, the sampling should be carried out without bias, the samples must be "fair"; and third, the characters whose distribution is investigated must be pre- designated or predicted prior to drawing a sample, if that sample is to serve as evidence for any hypothesis concerning the constitution of the field. And Peirce concludes that while in any given case the process may lead to false results, it will, if pursued far enough, ap- proximate more and more closely to the truth. Now it is true that the method of sampling Peirce discusses is, in general outlines, the one pursued in the sciences. But isn't Peirce claiming more for the method than is warranted? Thus, the asser- tion that if samples are drawn "fairly," i.e., without bias, they will ultimately yield a "fair," i.e., representative, sample of the consti- tution of a field, is either a bald tautology, or is a material assump-</page><page sequence="21">PEIRCE'S GUESSES AT THE RIDDLE 385 tion to the effect that the specific mode of sampling is carried on in such a way that every variation in the field will turn up in our samples at some time or other. But if the amount of independent variety in the field should be indefinitely large (or even too large to handle with the methods at our disposal) we may never obtain representative samples no matter how, or how far, we carry on the process. Some material assumption, e.g., the existence of a limit in a rapidly converging series of variations, or the existence of a finite number of types or classes in nature, seems to be required if the process of "fair" sampling should yield representative ones. It is true that such a material assumption is itself a hypothesis, and must be evaluated in accordance with the usual canons. But this only goes to show that we can get no absolute guarantee in advance that any given method will work, no matter how trustworthy it may have shown itself to be. I also can not escape the impression that in spite of Peirce's vehement denial of the principle of antecedent equiprobabilities, it returns to plague him. The process of sampling depends on the fact that more samples of a certain kind appear than others. But why do they ? Because, the answer is, more samples of that kind occur in the field studied. But since samples not yet drawn exist only potentially in the field, it is legitimate to ask why there should be potentially more of one kind than of another. And the answer seems to be that if all the relevant characters in the field were combined in every permissible way, and if all these permissible combinations were anTtecedently equally probable, then there would be more of one kind than of another. Because of the sharp distinction Peirce makes between induction and presumption, he tends to obscure the identity of the processes employed, say, in evaluating the constitution of a cargo of wheat and in determining the correctness of the theory of gravitation.8 This has as a consequence an unnecessary restriction of the frequency theory of probability, a restriction which is being removed by modern students. But already Royce showed that in evaluating a theory we are taking samples from all its logical consequences. There is therefore no good reason to doubt the universal applicability of the frequency theory of probability and the essential identity of scien- tific method in all departments of science. IV The editors of this edition deserve the congratulations of all stu- dents for their self-effacing and intelligent labor in bringing a sem- 8 He declares he had committed a fundamental error in his Johns Hopkins essay on "Probable Inference," but he does not state explicitly what the error is (2.102).</page><page sequence="22">386 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY blance of order into a wilderness of manuscript. They have almost achieved what Peirce thought impossible for mortal man to do. Each volume has been supplied with very full indices, and in several cases with helpful explanatory notes. In the light of the enormity of the task and the excellence of the achievement, it may seem ungracious to find fault. But I think it is unfortunate that Peirce's larger manuscripts have been broken up and distributed throughout the volumes; this is especially true for the completed Grand Logic, the several chapters of the Minute Logic, and the Lowell Lectures. One may also question the judgment of the editors in neglecting to in- clude in these early volumes certain outstanding papers to illustrate Peirce's doctrines: e.g., his review of Frazer's Berkeley for his views on nominalism, or his essay on the "Fixation of Belief" for his doc- trine of fallibilism. Because of the topical arrangement of the papers, the historically interested reader will be able to estimate the extent to which Peirce's ideas underwent change only by a painful leafing of each volume. It is hoped the editors will manage to in- clude a table in the final volume indicating where the component parts of the larger manuscripts are to be found, and possibly also the chronological sequence of the papers.
