<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Pendet Homo Incertus": Gray's Response to Locke Part Two: "De principiis Cogitandi" S. H. CLARK WRITING IN LATIN offers a kind of liberation for Gray. Whereas the use of latinate idioms in his English verse often seems convoluted, affectedly archaic, the reverse movement, the translation of contem- porary concepts back into classical terms, permits a certain disen- gagement, a self-reflective scrutiny. For example, sentiment is repre- sented as fountain in both "The Progress of Poesy" and the "Alcaic Fragment": Thine too these golden keys, immortal boy! This can unlock the gates of joy; Of horrour that, and thrilling fears, Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic tears. (11.91-4) O lachrimarum fons, tenero sacros Ducentium ortus ex animo; quater Felix! in imo qui scatentem Pectore te, pia Nympha, sensit! (11.1-4) 0 fount of tears, that have their sacred sources in the tender spirit; four times blessed is he who has felt you, holy Nymph, gushing forth from the depths of his heart! It is difficult not to feel that the English is over-excited: the prosaic literalism of "keys" is swept aside amidst the haste and indistinctness of the subsequnt personifications. The Latin, in contrast, although 484</page><page sequence="2">GRAY'S RESPONSE TO LOCKE 485 more intimately personal, has a discretion in its self-revelation: where "immortal" and "sacred" lavish a cosmetic religiosity, "pia" and "sacros" are quieter, more civic, uninflated, permitting the subtle mutual qualification of "animo" and "pectore." It is a more precise statement about a fountain (particularly "scatentem," welling up), and hence a more impressive presentation of tears, less easily assimilated into the rhetoric of sympathy. This perhaps fails to make allowance for the specifically vatic nature of the English poem, but the same insta- bility is apparent, for example, if one contrasts the "Sonnet on the Death of Mr Richard West" with the disciplined anguish of the Latin threnody on the same event in the second book of De Principiis Cogitandi. So, against Coleridge's condemnation of the "translation of prose thoughts into poetic language,"1 I would argue that composing in Latin, far from being a prolix and stiflng search for equivalences, allows a kind of troping of the English concept. Gray's Latin style is no less composite and derivative than his English: it does tend to be terser and more specific, but it is not a question of translating the abstract into the particular. Instead, the relation is more one of tenor to ve- hicle, or focus to frame:2 transposition into an alien linguistic con- text provokes redefinition of a whole semantic field, and allows the emergence of new meaning. And this "impertinence," to use Paul Ricoeur's term, serves as a creation or reactivation of metaphor.3 In the first part of this essay,4 I examined how the pervasive influence of Locke's thought shaped Gray's English writing; I shall now go on to explore the response of his Latin poetry to this epistemology, and the attempt of De Principiis Cogitandi to restore strangeness, difficulty, and mythical potency to its assumptions. This troping back is first prominent in "Latin Verses at Eton" written 1 Biographia Literaria, or, Biographical Sketches of my Literary Life and Opinions, edited by James Engell and W. J.

Little enough of this is apparent for the opening twenty lines, a series of generalized propositions in a physico-theological idiom, in which a celebratory description of the physical universe is designed to incul- cate a due sense of humility in man. The intrusion of books into the state of Nature, however, introduces an element of heightened self- consciousness, and suspicion of the preceding sweeping antitheses: Hic ubi rimari, atque impallescere libris Perstitit, anne valet qua vi connexa per aevum Conspirent elementa sibi, serventque tenorem; Sufficiant scatebrae unde mari, fontesque perennes Iugis aquae fluviis, unde aether sidera pascat, Pandere? Does man, when he pursues knowledge and grows pale over his books, gain the power to disclose by what force the elements, joined together through eternity, retain their harmony and maintain their course un- changed? Or to disclose whence the gushing springs fill up the sea and the unceasing streams the rivers of fresh water, and how the ether nourishes the stars? "Rimari" means to observe scientifically, or, literally, to peer with one's eyes, yet what is seen is already an interpretation. The scientific cruxes invoked-the binding forces between atoms, the origin of springs (again), and the composition of the aether- all stress the recal- citrance of nature to sensory investigation. One might expect at this point some cheerful mockery of the pretensions of the new science, but instead, the imperative to disclose becomes self-directed, and the poem takes a sudden lurch inwards: nequaquam: secreta per avia mundi Debile carpit iter, vix, et sub luce maligna Pergit, at incertam tendit trepidare per umbram. (11.26-8) By no means! He takes his feeble way across the remote and lonely regions of the world, scarcely advancing through the half-light and moving fearfully through the uncertain shadows. What had previously seemed firmly externalized, though in a thor- oughly literary world, now becomes an introspective quest, bleakly</page><page sequence="4">GRAY'S RESPONSE TO LOCKE 487 secular, without acknowledged beginning or foreseeable end.S "Mundi," which would normally imply expansive vistas, is drawn down by "secreta," "sub luce maligna," and "umbram," into a subterranean realm of uncertainty: allusions to Virgil's description of crossing the Styx and entry into Hades further stress its purgatorial nature. The se- quence of adjectives is interesting: we are virtually obliged to read "incertam ... per umbram" as a transferred epithet, particularly after the opening "Homo incertus,' and the same device recurs in "secreta,' "debile," and "maligna." This repeated divesting of adjectival quali- ties has the effect of a virtual paring down into an interior void. Man is his penumbral world: he brings to it only the capacity to be pas- sively formed. Fata obstant; metam Parcae posuere sciendi, Et dixere: veni huc, Doctrina, hic terminus esto. (11.29-30) Destiny opposes him; the Fates have put a limit to knowledge and said, "Come this far, Learning, but let this be your boundary." This endless aimless pilgrimage is then juxtaposed with the stark clarification of limits of "metam sciendi." The transposition of a di- vine Providence into the classical "Fata" and "Parcae" allows the ar- bitrariness, even brutality, of this demarcation to emerge. "Doctrina" seems to represent not so much an inclusive ideal of learning, the "grateful Science" of the "Ode" (1.3), as that which a man can con- ceivably amass as knowledge: the unnamed traveller is literally that which he has learnt. The lecture delivered by the "Fata" (11.30-37) forms an obvious contrast to the earlier boastful anthropomorphism. The immediate texture of sensory impressions there celebrated van- ishes as illusory: all that remains is a twilight region of shadow and whirlpool. What is most striking is the unqualified insistence on ab- solute closure: Non super aethereas errare licentius auras Humanum est, et scire hominem; breve limite votum Exiguo claudat, nec se quaesiverit extra. (11.31-3) 5 The theme of initiation by descent appears in various other guises; as Norse heroics in "The Descent of Odin," as romance extravaganza in the "Translation from Tasso," and as in burlesque in "Lines Spoken by the Ghost of John Dennis at the Devil Tavern," espe- cially 11.14-35.</page><page sequence="5">488 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES It is not given to man to wander more freely above the upper air, but to know Man. He should confine his little desires within narrow bounds and not search beyond himself. "Claudat" seems to spring shut, like a trap, an effect reinforced by the contrast between the humiliating diminishment of "exiguo" and the spacious "extra." The unfairness is evident in the virtual conflation of two senses of "errare": man is compelled to wander, but to wander is to err, so, metonymically, he is guilty because of his punishment. It is possible, particularly in view of the preceding "licentius" and "votum," to read the final four lines as primarily a sexual prohibition: Errat, qui cupit oppositos transcendere fines, Extenditque manus ripae ulterioris amore; Illic gurges late hiat, illic saeva vorago, Et calgantes longis ambagibus umbrae. (11.34-7) He errs who wishes to pass the limits set for him, and reaches out his hands in longing for the farther shore. There the raging torrent stretches wide and the fearsome whirlpool, and the shadows darkening in endless obscurities. "Cupit" and "amore" are explicitly terms of desire: "gurges" becomes a synonym for passion: the "saeva vorago" becomes a powerful image of sexual destructiveness. The lines, however, refuse to be so confined. The wish to cross the prescribed "limits" of our "little reign" ("op- positos transcendere fines") surely contains something of Shelley's definition of love: The great secret of morals is love; or a going out of our own nature, and an identification, of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own.6 This is an offering rather than an evasion, and the hint of absurdity in the gesture of the outstretched hand cannot detract from its dig- nity. The indeterminacy of "illic" allows a narrative chiasmus to occur: suddenly it seems as if the hand is receding from us into darkening shadow, as if our own momentary possibility of contact has been lost. 6 A Defence of Poetry, in The Complete Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, edited by Roger Ingpen and Walter E. Peck, 10 vols (London: Ernest Benn, 1926-30), vii, p. 118.</page><page sequence="6">GRAY'S RESPONSE TO LOCKE 489 It is obviously hard to decide how far it is justified to read this adolescent school-exercise as a specific response to Locke, though it is worth recalling that Mark Akenside began his esoteric The Pleasures of Imagination as a butcher's apprentice in Newcastle. The explicit intention of the Essay is "to prevail with the busy Mind of Man, to be more cautious in meddling with things exceeding its Com- prehension" (1:1:4), but a host of classical analogues can also be found which recommend a stoic acquiescence in limitation, the most ob- vious example being the epigraph taken from Persius. The poem's anxious theological precision, however, distinguishes it as peculiarly eighteenth century, although there is little to confirm a direct reading of Locke.8 The passage on the disproportion of the senses (11.46-68) can be traced back to the Essay (2:23:12), but its most obvious source is Pope, and in itself indicates no more than the popular dissemina- tion of Locke's work. The continuity, however, between this text and Gray's later confrontation with Locke in the epic fragment, De Prin- cipiis Cogitandi, offers a more substantial connection. The poem is first alluded to in a letter to Richard West in April 1741: I have spoken with such freedom on this head, that it seems but just that you should have your revenge; and therefore I send you the beginning not of an Epic Poem, but of a Metaphysic one. Poems and Metaphysics (say you, with your spectacles on) are inconsistent things. A metaphysical poem is a contradiction in terms. It is true, but I will go on. It is Latin too, to increase the absurdity. It will, I suppose, put you in mind of the man who wrote a treatise of Canon Law in Hexameters. Pray help me to the descrip- tion of a mixt mode, and a little Episode about Space. (TGC 1:97 p. 183). The crucial sentence is the third one: "a metaphysical poem is a con- 7 "Quem te Deus esse/ lussit et humana qua parte locatus es in re/ Desce," Satires iii 11.71-3: "learn what God has commanded you to be, and in what station you are placed in human affairs." 8 Gray's personal bibliography, begun during his first term at Cambridge, lists two editions of Locke, which were probably in his possession at Eton.

This antagonism reverberates far beyond the im- mediate issue of achieving a palatable mode of versification for ab- stract argument. What status can poetry aspire to while adhering to an epistemology that would seem to reduce it to, at best, decorative ornamentation? Being written in Latin only "increases" an "absur- dity" that is inherent in the idea of poetry itself. The banter becomes plaintive, a literal appeal for a viable "mixt mode" of writing, more psychic "Space": the initial "freedom" of personal voice is intimidated and belittled by a "Metaphysic" that is significantly compared to "Canon Law."10 Yet this translation into Latin divests Lockean concepts of their sacrosanctness and interrogates their pretensions to dictate the terms of defining a self. Their authority is not exposed or debunked by this scrutiny, but instead revealed in all its traumatic grandeur: Unde Animus scire incipiat: quibus incohet orsa Principiis seriem rerum, tenuemque catenam Mnemosyne: Ratio unde rudi sub pectore tardum Augeat imperium; et primum mortalibus aegris Ira, Dolor, Metus, et Curae nascantur inanes Hinc canere aggredior. Nec dedignare canentem, O decus! Angliacae certe oh lux altera gentis! Si qua primus iter monstras, vestigia conor Signare incerta, tremulaque insistere planta.

(11.1-15) From what origins the Mind begins to have knowledge; from what beginnings Memory arises and sets in order the sequence of events and her slender chain; whence Reason spreads its gradual mastery 10 For more in this vein, see Gray's undergraduate references to philosophy, where an element of alarmed fascination occasionally breaks through the defensive facetious- ness: "the Term is now begun again, &amp; I have made such a wonderful progress in Philos- ophy, that I begin to be quite persuaded, that black is white, &amp; that fire will not burn, &amp; that I ought not, either to give credit to my eyes or feeling; they tell me too, that I am nothing in the world, &amp; that I only fancy, I exist: do but come to me quickly &amp; one lesson of thine, my dear Philosopher, will restore me to the use of my Senses &amp; make me think myself something" (7GC 9, p. 18).</page><page sequence="8">GRAY'S RESPONSE TO LOCKE 491 in the savage breast; and whence anger, grief, fear, and insubstantial cares are first born to wretched mortals; it is of these matters that I begin my song. Do not disdain the singer, thou glory! thou second sun of the English race! Wherever thou first point the way, I am trying to mark thy faint footprints and to follow, albeit with hesitant tread. Better still (for thou are able to do all things), thyself lead the way to the holy threshold (if I approach with reverence and a pure heart) and throw open the mighty portals of secret Nature. Disclose, father, the unseen causes of things and their awful source; for to thee, thou great priest of truth, the hearts of men and the innermost places of the lofty mind lie open. The extravagance of this opening apostrophe attempts to reactivate the mythological potency dormant within the language of reason it- self. The enigma of origins is stressed to the point of tautology, and an unbridgable divide appears to open between the prosaic Lockean schema of Mind, Memory, and Reason and the unanswerable "unde" ("For man to tell how human life began/Is hard; for who himself be- ginning knew?").' I But the resultant conceptual impasse deprives this empiricist trinity of any claim to immutable logical detachment, and allows them to be reanimated as symbolic agents, waging an internal War maintain'd in the Breast of every particular Man, who labours to subdue himself by establishing the Empire of Reason over his Passions &amp; Desires. (CB 2 p. 681) One would expect the faculty psychology of "Ira, Dolor, Metus et Curae" to be opposed by Courage or Love or Pity in the struggle for "imperium" over the unruly breast. Instead they confront the founding principles of the Lockean epistemology. The status of Mind, Memory, and Reason becomes no more objective than that of the overtly literary personifications which oppose them. All the participants in this psy- chomachia are equally the creation of "mortalibus aegris," fictive, without substance. "Inanes" offers a good example of the open-ended reverberation that Gray can achieve in his Latin verse. It is directly attached to "Curae" in the sense of futile or idle. Yet in the context of a direct invocation of Locke, any reference to emptiness must trigger associations of the tabula rasa. The term expands out of its context II Paradise Lost, viii, 11.251-52, in John Milton: Poetical Works, edited by Douglas Bush (London: Oxford Univ.

The image of "caecas rerum causas, fontemque severum" (1.13) has now become explicitly psychological. Psycho- logical, but not purely self-expressive; it is important to make this distinction, for there is a toughness, an intellectual accountability, in the later poem's use of philosophical reference. "Vestigia incerta," for example, appears to refer to Locke's famous section on memory (as does the earlier "tenuem catenam"): In all these cases, Ideas in the Mind quickly fade, and often vanish quite out of the Understanding, leaving no more footsteps or remaining Characters of themselves, than Shadows do flying over Fields of Corn; and the Mind is as void of them, as if they never had been there. (2:10:4) Locke's footsteps are "incerta" (here, as always, an immensely powerful term for Gray) because they preach doubt; because the poet feels his own inadequacy in following them; because footprints fade. It is this final literal meaning that leads into Locke: all ideas are subject to a physical decay, both our present understanding and our access to the past are in a state of continual erosion, and so the very enterprise of thought is endowed with an elegiac pathos. All that it can hope to do is engage in a perpetual holding operation, temporarily pre- serve ("signare") its own disappearing traces. The classical idiom enables a profound ambivalence in the presen- tation of Locke himself. He is a high priest ("veri magne Sacerdos") with powers to guide and initiate: in contrast to the poet and his fellow mortals, both stigmatized as "aegris," he is wisdom personified. Yet despite his power to act as "lux altera, Nature still remains "obscurae," causes are "caecas," the fountain "severum." The possibility emerges that he has not so much dispelled mystery as become allied to it. Nature becomes a pagan temple, demanding a pure heart as price of admission to her secrets ("sancum ad limen"): the ritual of exami- nation performed within carries overtones of menace and literal sacrifice. 12 Johnson, Lives 1:460.</page><page sequence="10">GRAY'S RESPONSE TO LOCKE 493 The act of disclosure was crucial in "Latin Verses" as well, where the brutally interrogative enjambement on "pandere" (1.24) precipi- tated the sudden lurch inwards. A similar crisis is apparent in the final lines of this passage, with the stark imperative "pande, pater" reinforced by the subsequent "corda patent hominum." To question is to lay open, and neither the "altae penetralia Mentis" nor the most obscure enigmas of the natural world are to be spared the probings of this intellectual scalpel: Obscurae reserans Naturae ingentia claustra (1.12) Throw open the mighty portals of secret Nature. Ecce autem naturae ingens aperitur imago Immensae variique patent commercia mundi (11.52-3) Then, behold a vast image of boundless Nature is disclosed, and the activities of the varied world are laid open. Tum species primum patefacta est candida Lucis (1.81) Then, for the first time, the bright face of Light is revealed. In primis spatii quam multa par aequor Millia multigenis pandant se corpora saeclis Expende. (11.179-81) First of all, consider how many myriads of bodies through so many ages have appeared in the tracts of space. This insistent revelation of ultimate origins is most forcefully present in the opening lines, but never long submerged: non illa leves primordia motus, Quanquam parva, dabunt. Laetum vel amabile quicquid Usquam oritur, trahit hinc ortum: (11.18-20) For these beginnings, though small, will give rise to no trivial activi- ties. Wherever anything delightful or attractive comes into being, it is to these it owes its origin. Principio, ut magnum foedus Natura creatrix Firmavit ... (11.32-3)</page><page sequence="11">494 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES In the beginning, when all-creating Nature confirmed the great cove- nant ... Inde potestatum enasci densissima proles (1.191) Thence is born a multitudinous offspring of powers. The opposing themes pivot on the ambiguity of "recludo," as both to lay bare and to inspire with life: tactus tamen aura lacessit Iamdudum levior sensus, animamque reclusit. (11.73-4) A slight breath has already stimulated his sense of touch and released his soul. The activation of the sense of touch in the womb allows the influx of sense impressions, and hence can be specified as the point of origin of the self.13 This leaves two questions unanswered: firstly, what is the status of the slight breeze, "levior aura," and more importantly, what relation does the soul bear to the mind so formed? In his anno- tations to Plato, Gray observes: Clear and certain Knowledge rare &amp; in few instances; forced to supply the Defect by Comparison and Analogy. Necessity of tracing Things up to their first Principles. (CB 2 p. 645) and implements this quite drastically in his description of the forma- tion of the mind. Locke himself carefully refrains from discussing "the Physical Consideration of the Mind" (1:2:2): Gray has no such reticence: Nunc age quo valeat pacto, qua sensilis arte Affectare viam, atque animi tentare latebras Materies (dictis aures adverte faventes) Exsequar. (11.176-9) 13 Compare Locke's statement, "Therefore I doubt not but Children, by the exercise of their Senses about Objects, that affect them in the Womb, receive some few Ideas, before they are born" (2:9:5).</page><page sequence="12">GRAY'S RESPONSE TO LOCKE 495 Now I shall explain by what means and what art sensible matter takes its way to and penetrates the secret places of the mind (give my words a favourable hearing). The origin of intellect is traced back to Nature's giving of form to atoms: these in turn emit images ("notitiae," "simulacra," 1.51), which enter the brain, and provide the material out of which the mind, by a second act of creation, is composed.14 Such an explicitly atomistic derivation of the self would appear to leave little scope for any concept of imagination: the initial defer- ence towards Locke's achievement ("Nec dedignare canentem" 1.6) verges on the abject, and the poem is liberally strewn with self-belittling pleas for indulgence. The extended assertion of the power of poetic inspiration (11.16-31) culminates in the declaration that the Golden Muse "non alia se iactat origine" (1.31), but this "boast of no other origin" remains uneasily perched between an imperious proclama- tion of her self-begetting and an inglorious admission of her ultimate dependence on sense-ideas. Such veiling ambiguities contribute little or nothing to the poem: its relative autonomy owes far more to the forthrightness of its materialism. Writing in Latin encourages, in- deed compels, Gray to translate Locke into the terms of classical phi- losophy. This produces a radically polarized reading, which dissolves the Essay into a constant antagonism between elements of Lucretian atomism and of a Platonic myth of exile in the body. Does the soul fall into matter, or is it created from it? Gray tends to argue the latter while remaining emotionally committed to the former. The debt to Lucretius is explicit and pervasive. Gray himself refers to the poem as "Master Tommy Lucretius" (lUC 115: p. 225), and even Mason is obliged to acknowledge, however reluctantly:15 It is clear, however, from the Exordium itself, that he meant to make the same use of Mr. Locke's Essay on the human Understanding, which Lucretius did of the Dogmas of Epicurus. 14 The parallel is further reinforced by the recurrence of such terms as "primordia"' (1.18,1.188); "pandere" (1.14, 1.180). 15 The Poems of Mr. Gray. to which are prefixed Memoirs of his Life and Writings, 2 vols (Dublin, 1775), 1, pp. 153-54. See also T. J. B. Spencer, "Lucretius and the Scientific Poem in English," in Lucretius, edited by D. R. Dudley (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1965), pp. 131-64.</page><page sequence="13">496 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Technical philosophical terms are invariably transposed into Lucre- tian terminology; and the poem is dominated by such concepts as 'primordia' (atoms, first-beginnings), 'principium' (basic law), and 'foedus' (natural law), and the presentation of Nature as both 'creatrix' (1.32) and 'saeva' (1.159), fecund and pitiless and impossible to resist: Nec vario minus introitu magnum ingruit Illud, Quo facere et fungi, quo res existere circum Quamque sibi proprio cum corpore scimus, et ire Ordine, perpetuoque per aevum flumine labi. (11.172-5) And by no less varied entrances, that great power forces its way in, whereby we know that we act and are acted upon, and that objects exist around us, each with its individual form, and progress in due order, borne along on the endless stream through the ages. As this passage indicates, it is also the giver of form, bounding out- line, 'circumcaesura' (1.185), to what otherwise would be mere chaos, clamouring for existence, 'extremo ... in limine rerum' (1.187). The dissolving of Locke's corpuscularian tendencies back into a more rig- orous and integrated atomism is not accompanied by any endorse- ment of this impersonal vitalism. Instead, there is a peculiar sense of encirclement, of a desire to fend off, preserve some vestige of a privileged psychic enclave. The concern with privacy and encroach- ment everywhere apparent in Gray here takes on an almost phenomeno- logical dimension: consciousness's last stand. The elevation of touch over sight in the poem has often been noted, but usually in biographical or psychoanalytical terms.16 This is surely unnecessarily restrictive. The immediate intellectual justification for this precedence is that touch is concerned with primary qualities,17 whereas there is always something potentially illusory about the world of color and perspective revealed by sight. More important, how- ever, seems to be its greater quanrtitative vulnerability, the sheer sur- 16 Jean Hagstrum, for example, argues that it displays nostalgia for "a pregenital, pancorporal sexuality, the physical love of boyhood" felt towards West and Walpole: "Gray's Sensibility," in "Fearful Joy": Papers from the Thomas Gray Bicentenary Conference at Carleton University, edited by James Downey and Ben Jones (Montreal: McGill-Queens Univ.

The body becomes a fabric, 'sensile textum' (1.41), literally woven out of palpitating nerve-ends: amplius ille Imperium affectat senior, penitusque medullis, Visceribus habitat totis, pellesque recentem Funditur in telam, et late per stamina vivit. (11.66-69) As the eldest, it claims wider sway, and has its abode deep in the marrow and the vitals, spreading into the outermost web of the skin, and has its being everywhere among the threads. This ought to contribute to a general emotional heightening eminently compatible with the Lockean hedonic scale. But perception is not access to the world: it is the world breaking in. Comminus interdum non ullo interprete per se Nervorum invadunt teneras quatientia fibras, Sensiferumque urgent ultro per viscera motum. (11.205-7) Meanwhile, while no intermediary, they themselves attack at close quarters, battering on the delicate fibres of the nerves spontaneously, and driving the sense-carrying impulse throughout the vitals. There can be no hope of quarter or treaty ("non ullo interprete"): the clamouring mob of ideas is engaged in a continuous assault ("invadunt") on the defenceless nerves, utilizing both hand-to-hand combat ("com- minus") and battering-ram ("quatentia") to gain access to "arcem cerebri," the citadel of the brain (1.48). The siege becomes a torrential flooding in the extended simile on "Sensation, the Origin of our Ideas" (Gray's note to 1.50): Ac uti longinquis descendunt montibus amnes Velivolus Tamisis, flaventisque Indus arenae, Euphratesque, Tagusque, et opimo flumine Ganges; Undas quisque suas volvens, cursuque sonoro In mare prorumpunt: hos magno acclinis in antro Excipit Oceansus, natorumque ordine longo Dona recognoscit venientum,ultroque serenat Caeruleam faciem, et diffuso marmore ridet.

Nevertheless, the simile insists on the reduction of the outer world involved in perception: its geographical expansiveness evokes the glamorous scale of external nature, and then contracts it to an underground world of caverns and liquid. The status of "Oceanus" is itself indeterminate. Does he exist prior to the flowing in of sense- impressions? The rivers are described as his children, but in what sense are they his offspring? Is the mind subject to a similar constant fluctuation, essential amorphousness? Gray awkwardly tries to com- bine an insistent metaphor of flux with the creation of a relatively permanent self by situating the presumably boundless "Oceanus" within the fixed boundaries of "antro." But the anthropomorphism of such terms as "acclinis," "excipit," and "natorum, cannot dispel an anxiety that that such stability is no more than a momentary illusion, to be immediately swept when the sluice-gates of sensation are opened. The Platonic influence is most apparent in the initial description of the foetus (11.32-8), the account of birth, (11.75-84), and, more tacitly, in the light imagery running through the poem. Principio, ut magnum foedus Natura creatrix Firmavit, tardis iussitque inolescere membris Sublimes animas; tenebroso in carcere partem Noluit aetheream longo torpere veterno: Nec per se proprium passa exercere vigorem est, Ne sociae molis coniunctos sperneret artus, Ponderis oblita, et caelestis conscia flammae. (11.32-8) In the beginning, when all-creating Nature confirmed the great cove- nant and ordered divine souls to grow in sluggish bodies, she did not wish that ethereal part to grow dull with long imprisonment in a shadowy cell; nor did she allow it to exercise its special powers in</page><page sequence="16">GRAY'S RESPONSE TO LOCKE 499 isolation, lest it despise the jointed limbs of the mass to which it was bound, forgetful of their weight and aware only of its celestial flame. The covenant ("foedus") with Nature can easily be seen as a sentence. The language of confinement, ostensibly directed against the con- strictions of the womb, becomes aimed at the body itself ("teneroso in carcere . .. longo . .. veterno") where the soul has been ordered ("iussit"). It must be mollified lest it feel nothing but contempt for the limbs to which it has literally been bound ("coniunctos"). The implications of punitive exile becomes even clearer at birth: Idque magis simul ac solitum blandumque calorem Frigore mutavit caeli, quod verberat acri Impete inassuetos artus: tum saevior adstat, Humanaeque comes vitae Dolor excipit; ille Cunctantem frustra, et tremulo multa ore querentem Corripit invadens, ferreisque amplectitur ulnis. (11.75-80) This happens all the more at the moment when he exchanges the fa- miliar soothing warmth for the cold of the atmosphere, which strikes at his unaccustomed limbs with a bitter onslaught. Then, yet more cruelly, Pain, the companion of human life, is waiting to receive him and tears out with violent hands the child who in vain delays and utters many querulous cries, clasping him in its iron embrace. The "solitum blandumque calorem" might, with some justice, be de- scribed as the amniotic equivalent of Eton College: the fall from pro- tected innocence is equally absolute. Although the cold strikes at the child's limbs, its moral savagery is emphasised in the epiphet "acri": to be conscious is to be vulnerable. This modulates, via "saevior," into the personification of "Dolor," which acts both as midwife and as accompanying demon. It should be stressed that this agony is not identified with the physical pangs of birth: it is caused by the reluc- tant victim's futile attempt to escape: Cunctantem frustra, et tremulo ore querentem (1.79) This is not solely a Platonic recoil from contamination by matter ("con- tage," 1.47), an anguish at the loss of Eternity. Without entering the brutal confrontation with suffering that characterises mortal life, the child cannot become human: it would remain infinitely malleable,</page><page sequence="17">500 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES without interior. The iron embrace ("ferreis ulnis") is that of the "stern rugged Nurse" of the "Ode to Adversity" (1.13), for whom pain and growth are inseparable. The awakening through pain allows access to the antithetical prin- ciple of light, here elevated to an equally mythic status: Tum species primum patefacta est candida Lucis (Usque vices adeo Natura bonique, malique, Exaequat, iustaque manu sua damna rependit) Tum primum, ignotosque bibunt nova lumina soles. (11.81-4) Then, for the first time, the bright face of Light is revealed (in such a way does Nature balance good and evil by turns and with just hand make amends for the harm she inflicts); and then it is that the new- born eyes first drink in the sunlight unknown before. The embrace of "Dolor" has become transfigured into an upward gaze towards Light, an imbibing of sunlight as if suckled by it. Does light serve as reward or redemption or consolation? It seems to be used two ways in the passage: firstly, as that which enables the sense im- pressions received through sight (e.g., 11.158-161), and secondly, in an opposition between an internal spark ("roseum lumen;' 1.24; "cae- lestis ... flammae," 1.38) and the divine "Lux," with which it craves reunion, and from which it must be shielded (11.97-108). The usages inevitably overlap, in fact rarely separate out. This is closely based on Locke: And how covetous the Mind is, to be furnished with all such Ideas, as have no pain accompanying them, may be a little guess'd, by what is observable in Children newborn, who always turn their Eyes to that part, from whence the Light comes, lay them how you please. (2:9:7). Empirical description becomes symbolic parable. But this is not a wilful appropriation by Gray: he activates something already present in Locke's description. The "new-born" mind immediately turns to, desires reunion with, "that part, from whence the Light comes": the instance of the child only allows the bliss of a realm "with no pain" to "be a little guess'd." But this intimation of total illumination cannot justify the intrusion of the principle of concordia discors. The child can only be said to deserve its ordeal with pain as a kind of primal guilt. Piety is preceded by a state not of non-piety, but of impiety: the child is guilty through not yet having been punished.</page><page sequence="18">GRAY'S RESPONSE TO LOCKE 501 This paradox is integral to the nature of "Reflection, the other Source of our Ideas" (Gray's note to 1.135). Qualis Hamadryadum quondam si forte sororum Una, novos peragrans saltus, et devia rura; (Atque illam in viridi suadet procumbere ripa Fontis pura quies, et opaci frigoris umbra) Dum prona in latices speculi de margine pendet, Mirata est subitam venienti occurrere Nympham: Mox eosdem, quos ipsa, artus eadem ora gerentem Una inferre gradus, una succedere silvae Aspicit alludens; seseque agnoscit in undis. Sic sensu interno rerum simulacra suarum Mens ciet, et proprios observat conscia vultus. (11.143-53) It is just as if one of the sister Hamadrydads of old was wandering thorugh unknown glens and trackless country (and utter stillness and the shade's dark chill moved her to lie down on the green bank of a stream). As she lay hanging from the bank over the mirroring water, she was amazed that a Nymph at once came to meet her. Soon she noticed, while she sported, that, with the same limbs and features as her own, it moved forward as she did and, as she did, withdrew to the wood: and she recognised herself in the waters. Thus it is that the mind stirs up by some inner sense images of its own functions and consciously examines its own features. This seems more lightweight, a literary illustration. It should be noted, however, that the landscape is that of the invocation ("novos pere- grans saltus et devia rura," "opaci frigoris umbra"): the imperative urging self-knowledge ("sese explorat") is never to be taken lightly. The innocence, almost fecklessness, of the Nymph's actions insis- tently recall the myth of Narcissus: to discover one's self in the waters is in a sense to be their captive. The simile can be read as a Platonic parable of the entrapment of the soul in sensory flux. It is as if having a self at all involves delusion, loss, and estrangement: the nymph can never again rise from the waters. An unexpected analogue can be found in the "Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat, Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes": The pensive Selima reclined, Gazed on the lake below Her conscious tail her joy declared; The fair round face, the snowy beard,</page><page sequence="19">502 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES The velvet of her paws, Her coat that with the tortoise vies, Her ears of jet and emerald eyes, She saw; and purred applause. (11.5-12) The initial verbs, "reclined" and "gazed,' are reduced to virtual ad- jectives, framing Selima within a static tableau. Her transfixed gaze, however, becomes an actively transforming force. It allows her to be- come "conscious" of herself for the first time: the deferred "saw" achieves an almost revelatory force. But self-consciousness is achieved only through being bound to an ultimately destructive illusion. Selima assumes that she has put on power with her knowledge, that her "ar- dent wish" (1.21) cannot remain unfulfilled, and so falls victim to the "gulf between" (1.27). From hence, ye beauties, undeceived, Know, one false step is ne'er retrieved, And be with caution bold. Nor all that tempts your wandering eyes And heedless hearts is lawful prize; Nor all that glisters gold. (11.37-42) Underlying the final maxim is the distrust of color as a secondary quality: to be "undeceived" is to "know" that the "wandering eyes" cannot be trusted. (We recall Selima's earlier intoxication with the "beauties" of her own appearance: "snowy, "velvet, jet, and "emerald"). All that can be relied upon is "caution" and "heed": an ascetic restraint and unquestioning acceptance of the twilight path. As "Latin Verses" expressed it, "Fata Obstant": to the plight of the transgressor, "Malignant Fate sat by and smiled" (1.28). Here the very covertness of the Lockean injunction within a playful sententiousness renders it invulnerable. In De Principiis Cogitandi, Gray openly addresses the Lockean inheritance, but there are still limits to the extent that he hopes, or indeed wishes to transform it. It is too readily assumed that the "poetic Genius" has no choice but to repudiate this "universe of death." Gray's Latin epic, however, is not concerned to subvert or belittle Locke. Instead it initiates us into the complex figural dimensions of the Essay concerning Human Un- derstanding: its potent mythology of origins, its bleakly persuasive</page><page sequence="20">GRAY'S RESPONSE TO LOCKE 503 topology of twilight and exile, and its disclosure of guilt at the heart of thought itself. The power of reason is shown to derive from what it expels, denies itself, a sacrifice in excess of any preceding illusion; yet it cannot prevent a repressed idealism returning to haunt its lan- guage. I have dealt with the presence of these elements in Locke' own prose elsewhere. Here I have been concerned to establish that Gray's poetic commentary, far from being a secondary and ancillary "em- bellishment;' to use the customary eighteenth-century term, restores an obscured textual potency to the thought that it dramatises. The authority of John Locke represents not a fatal curtailment but a chal- lenge to be risen to and confronted.18 In meeting this demand, Gray deserves to be regarded not as a poignant casualty of the Age of Reason but as its supreme practitioner.
