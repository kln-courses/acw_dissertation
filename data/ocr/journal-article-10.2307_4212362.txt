Viktor Pelevin and Russian Postmodernist Prose SALLY DALTON-BROWN - A postmodernizm ia ne liubliu. Iskusstvo sovetskikh vakhterev. -Pochemu? -A im na postu skuchno bylo prosto tak sidet'. Vot oni postmodernizm i pridumali. Ty v samo slovo vslushaisia. V. Pelevin, 'Zhizn' nasekomykh'" Under the dominance of socialist realism; Soviet literature achieved a generic simplicity which permitted the majority of orthodox texts to be classified as didactic fairy-tales, incorporating easily recognizable themes and stylistic tactics.2 Since the gradual loosening of these stylistic and thematic fetters in the fifties, Russian literature and prose, that most inherently iconoclastic of genres (in Bakhtin's view), in particular, has been struggling towards postmodernist freedom and fragmentation. In this article, an introductory look at the major features of the Russian avant-garde movement since the early seventies permits some general definition of the characteristics of Russian postmodernist writing; this provides necessary background to an analysis of the work of the prose writer Viktor Pelevin (born I 962), whose innovative stories have already gained the accolade of the subsidiary Russian Booker Prize (given to work other than novels) in I993. Pelevin's work is the most essentially 'postmodern' of contemporary Russian prose. Creating ludic texts in which the ontological ramifications of the 'creative word' itself form the basis of his narrative play, Pelevin invites the reader to enter the 'game' of the text, and to discover that there is nTever any end to the game, never any return to 'reality', and no possibility of winning.

There are of course other definitions, but none which in my view so aptly encapsulates the essence of the movement.</page><page sequence="2">VIKTOR PELEVIN 2 I 7 Postmodernism is a term which can be defined in various ways, the least useful of which leans on chronology;3 other definitions often derive from comparisons between postmodernism and modernism, as in Brian McHales's definition of modernism as fiction dominated by epistemological uncertainty, and postmodernism as the literature of ontological questions.4 Whereas in modernism the loosening of the link between signified and signifier implied confusion and ideological crisis but not necessarily chaos, postmodernism severed the link. The doubtful veracity not only of the mimetic method in art, but of the phenomena which form the object of mimesis, was quickly established in postmodernist theory.5 Jean Baudrillard has suggested the concept of simulation, which implies that the real is unattainable or irrecover- able, having disintegrated under the weight of media images which in the present day simulate reality. Central to Baudrillard's writing is the concept of the code, most clearly formulated in his Symbolic Exchange and Death (I976). The code has superseded the sign; whereas the sign signifed the object to which it referred, the code simulates the object to which it refers (virtual reality being one example of simulation, cloned reality or hyperreality). Hyperreality, in Baudrillard's definition, is a version of the well-known 'world as text concept': 'the territory no longer precedes the map, nor survives it. Henceforth it is the map that precedes the territory that engenders the territory.'6 Once society becomes infiltrated with the code, then everything becomes undecidable; and all objects become inter- changeable in an era of simulation, which has been partly created by culture having become part of capitalist production; art 'has fallen into the world',7 become commodity or artefact, media icon or packaged nullity. Surfaces simulate reality; surfaces are reality, for postmodernism is about packaging. Language itself has become 'verbal spectacle'; Jean-Francois Lyotard, in The Postmodern Condition (I979), argued that metanarratives (which provide teleology for action, society or science) are no longer reliable, for they are part of a 'language game'.

Postmodernist literature is fragmented, self-referential, endlessly sceptical, even chaotic, a game played within hyperreality according to consciously artificial rules. Postmodernism in Russia discounting the avant-gardism of 1920S movements such as the Oberiuty (links between this period of the avant- garde and the post-I 970 period is a topic for more extensive study) -- theoretically began in the seventies with the new avant-gardism which gathered at the end of that decade around the idea of the Metropol' journal (I979), an attempt at creating a forum for free expression headed by Vasilii Aksenov, Andrei Bitov, Viktor Erofeev, Fazil' Iskander and Evgenii Popov. The label of dangerous innovators, of 'alternative' writers, has hung around the necks of these writers for some years.8 Other writers, such as Sasha Sokolov, Venedikt Erofeev, Eduard Limonov, Liudmila Petrushevskaia, Vladimir Sorokin and Valeriia Narbikova, have since been added to the group, and other names are appearing all the time; apart from the emerging talent Tat'iana Shcherbina, there are lesser-known names such as (Evgenii) Kharitonov, Shaparov, Shinkarev and Levkin, Rudnev, Radov, Zuev, Klekh and Kudriakov. Poets such as Lev Rubinshtein, Dmitrii Prigov and Timur Kibirov, or those working in the visual and performance arts are, arguably, more at the forefront of postmodernism than prose writers. However, it is in the prose forms in which the struggle both for and against postmodernism in other words, the attempt to achieve a consciously postmodern mode of writing, as well as the problems associated with such a self-referential style - is most clearly to be seen. Russian prose over the last ten years has not really learned how to play the postmodernist game nonchalantly. It tends to overlay the self-conscious 'game' of creating hyperrealities with a tone deriving from a sense of grim struggle for survival with no real likelihood of winning or of escape. Postmodernist prose itself becomes a referent for the post- glasnost' paradoxical condition of despairing and confined freedom. The anti-ideological basis on which Russian avant-garde prose was initially formed led both to the creation of a particular focused type of postmodernist ethos, and, paradoxically, may be leading to anti- postmodernism. In the seventies, avant-gardists reacted against the more accepted literary trends of the time; those of socialist realism, still much in evidence after the Thaw, and the two major post-fifties literary 8 An indispensable work for those interested in the literature of the avant-garde is Robert Porter's Russia's Alternative Prose, Oxford and Providence, RI, I 994.

Urban prose arguably created a basis for avant-gardism, in texts depicting reality which had become disseminated within subjective, ideologically tainted, viewpoints (one can think of Trifonov's urban tales with their depictions of confused intelligenty unable to appreciate the truth of the Stalin years). Mikhail Epshtein, the leading postmodernist critic in Russia, has argued that Russian postmodernism initially arose during the Stalinist thirties, an era of simulation during which ideological constructions were imposed with such force that they became hyperrealities (for they referred to a non-existent reality).9 However, literature did not begin to express this concept until later, with texts from the seventies characterized by the conscious awareness of the 'impossibility of describing realistically, of "reflecting" surrounding reality, since reality has been permeated by ideology'.' 0 The parodic function of much avant-garde literature may suggest that Russian literature, despite its history of living within the simula- crum created by ideology based on nothingness, found satire the path to referentiality. The satire, however, is not directed particularly at political targets, but rather at hyperreality, namely, literary hyperreal- ity, as for example in Andrei Bitov's well-known postmodernist Pushkinskii dom (written I 964-7 I, published abroad I 978), a work which subverts themes and ideas from Russian classical literature.'" This tendency towards a game of allusions has been well developed by Viacheslav P'etsukh, whose fovaia moskovskaiafilosofiia (i 989) is a parody of Dostoevskii's Prestuplenie i nakazanie, and his Istoriia goroda Glupova (i989) a continuation of Saltykov-Shchedrin's Istorija odnogo goroda, while several of his short stories allude to Chekhov (such as 'Nash chelovek v futliare', for example). P'etsukh suggests that there is nothing to write about except the metareality of art, parodied in his so-called 'realist' style, which operates purely according to the mysterious and illogical laws of fictive happenstance. Amongst other writers who also operate within this metalanguage is Evgenii Popov, whose spoof preface to his 'Restoran "Berezka"', subtitled 'poema i rasskazy o kommunistakh' (I99I), a subtitle which the work hardly validates, make his parodic intent clear, while Popov's constant message that the 9 M.

The need to satirize not merely the emptiness of language, but the destruction such a verbal vacuum has caused, is apparent in the new modes in which several writers, often labelled postmoderriists, have begun to write during the last decade: the dystopian or apocalyptic text and the 'mythical' text.'3 Such novels and povesti as Vladimir Voino- vich's Moskva 2042 (1 986), Vladimir Makanin's Dolog nash put' and Laz (I99I), certain stories of Liudmila Petrushevskaia such as 'Novye Robinzony' and 'Gigiena' (I989, I990), Oleg Ermakov's Znak zveria (1992), have depicted a nightmarish, post-holocaust Russia. Several of these writers have also indicated that they are seeking beyond destruction for a new voice, one rooted in a pre-ideological past. Writers such as Makanin (Otstavshii and Utrata, I987, and even before, in Golosa, I980), Liudmila Petrushevskaia (in her skazki) and Anatolii Kim in his texts based on Greek myth and folklore, such as his Poselok kentavrov (I992) or his Onliriia (I995), in their creation of 'new legends', or folkloristic versions of contemporary events, and even Aleksei Slapovskii in his 'religious' Pervoe vtoroe prishestvie (I993), appear to be reaching for new metanarratives. Their 'mythical' works possibly derive from that post-postmodernist 'hidden desire to find metafound- ations capable of uniting humankind'.'4 Russian culture finds itself today ambivalently desiring to 'invent new forms of cultural wholeness', at the same time that it is deeply suspicious of 'such potentially totalizing models'.'5 12 E.

When Popov writes in the preface to 'Magazin "Svet", ili Sumerki bogov' of the 'author' as a person who 'does not know what to write, for whom, where, why, from what and about what', he deliberately denigrates the position of the author, so long enthroned as educator and enlightener.

This character is strangely, yet inconclusively, prophetic, a figure symbolized by the chest of the title, which can be unpacked (as in Andre Gide's Les faux- monnaieurs) only to a degree, for it always opens onto further enigmas. 17 The writer is enticed within the confusing heteroglossia of the text (full polyphony is never reached due to the lack of clarity in narrative voice), only to find himself rebounding from his own subjectivity, as the unnamed narrator warns when he states that any meanings which we insert into the gaps in the text are our own.'8 The text utilizes many of the familiar devices of postmodernism such as the central 'gap' (or unexplained mystery/lack of significance), narrative heteroglossia, aspects of mass literature (the text in many ways parodies a detective novel, with Milashevich the object of investigation) and, chiefly, the metafictional idea of self-commentary; the novel is about postmodernist writing per se. Lizavin, researching Milashevich's life, is fascinated by the latter's strange style. Much of the writing of Milashevich, filled as it is with 'hints, hesitations, decadent shifting of pieces, misty symbolism and unexpressed thought' (p. 4'), appears on fantiki, sweet-wrappers. Milashevich's fantiki, 'splashes of time' ('byzgi vremeni', p. 67), are not merely a means of expression, but the ideas and philosophy themselves ('fantiki byli dlia Milashevicha bol'she, chem [...] sposobom obdumyvat' na bumage idei svoei filosofii. Oni sami byli ideei i filosofiei', p. I I 3). His fantiki present the world as an 'eternal collection of instants, the smallest, removed from time' ('vechnyi nabor mgnovenii, izmel'chennykh, iz"iatykh iz vrem- eni', ibid.). They are also described as atoms, from which either coal or diamond can be made (ibid.). Like Milashevich, Kharitonov attempts to provide the reader with a series of snapshots of ideas, characters, places, pieces of writing which 16 Mark Kharitonov, Linii sud'by, i1i Sunduchok Milashevicha, Druzhba narodov, 1992, 1-2, (hereafter Linii sud'by). 17 At one stage a link is made between the writing of the novel's shadowy 'hero', Milashevich, and the Apocrypha, but without any explanation. The eleventh of the text's eighteen chapters is entitled 'Ormuzd and Ahriman', referring to the Zoroastrian concept of two world forces - the good Ormuzd and the evil spirit Ahriman. However, the chapter is simply about Lizavin's spell in hospital; any philosophy is markedly absent, however, from this chapter. Another title is equally tantalizing: chapter nine is called 'The Lost Garden, or, God's Cunning', but this simply refers to a painting. 18 Kharitonov, Linii sud'by, p. 146.

It is clear that Kharitonov plays an enjoyable game of hints and suggestions with the reader,'9 but it can be argued that the game is a serious one, for Kharitonov is particularly concerned with time in the text (the familiar old themes of death, eternity and memory); he, like Aleksandr Blok, attempts to recreate the music of time in his work.20 His Vozvrashchenie neotkuda.( I995) is in many ways more concerned than Linii sud'by with surface rather than significance; the opening lines of the text, under the chapter heading of 'Voices in Emptiness' consists of a series of disjointed statements constructed on the basis that you can never distinguish between dream and waking dream. How serious is the game to be found in other postmodernist prose writing? As the critic Mikhail Zolotonosov has said, Russian post- modernist writers 'arrived on a scene littered with leftover debris; they learned not to take anything seriously and began constructing their own world out of these fragments, like parts from a children's construction set'.2' However, as Epshtein, again, has stated, 'any object is deconstructed in the very process of its construction. In Russia, nothingness comes to light [. . ] as the self-erasure of the positive form.'22 The development of much avant-garde prose has dealt with transgression and taboo, death and textural closure, fragmentation and metafictional self-strangulation. One can discern anger in the narrative voice; violence is constantly being done to the body of the text; we discover narrative rape, defilement and dismemberment, resulting in a prose of self-mutilation. Russian postmodernist prose is a literature of closure and/or fragmentation, which tends to turn in on itself, squeezing the flesh of the text until it disintegrates. As Mark Lipovetskii has stated, Russian culture as a whole in this postmodernist age has 'nowhere to go, it has ended, drained itself [ ischerpalas'] to the bottom'.23 It is unsurprising that death is the 'integral symbol' of Russian postmodernism.24 A brief look at the seventies avant-gardist texts indicate that, as well as the iconoclasm of the subject-matter (that is, the concern with sex 19 This is a game which he continues outside the boundaries of the text; see his answer to a question posed on the occasion of his winning of the Booker Prize, that the journalist interviewing him could 'read the doctoral dissertation of Anton Lizavin' on Milashevich: 'Premiia za luchshii russkii roman goda vruchena', Literaturnaia gazeta, I 6 December I 992, P. 7. 20 Ibid. 21 M.

They focus on the despoliation of the body, which becomes a metaphor for the hypocriti- cal prudery of the political patristic text, now stripped bare by the hooligan hand of the authors. Thus, a text such a Limonov's Eto ia Edichka (I 979) with its discourse on the taboo subject of homosexuality, is not merely a sensationalist novel, but an attempt to avoid the discredited tendency towards euphemism.26 Venedikt Erofeev's samizdat text Moskva-Petushki (written I 969- I 970, published abroad in 1973) is a brilliantly eclectic parody of socialist- realist themes and slogans, which reaches its apogee with the applica- tion by the narrator of Kantian terminology to a discussion on drunken hiccups. This is a philosophy of the pulses, philosophy tested on a body which is slowly poisoning itself with alcohol as an antidote to the greater poison of propaganda. As in Limonov's work, the physical is both stripped bare and revealed to be despoiled, infiltrated, in work which parodies or ignores an intellectual sphere debased by years of Stalinist lies. Innocence is forgotten in such texts which close themselves within the border of the bodily, and what remains is the honest sensation of penetration, a deliberately physical objective correlative for socialism's rape of the mind. Also apparent is a sense of claustropho- bia within the borders of the body, a feeling that the poisoned mind offers no channel for escape, that disintegration, then death, is the inevitable fate of the ailing protagonist. One brilliant example of such a text of infiltration is Viktor Erofeev's Russkaia krasavitsa (I 99o-92),27 which begins with a description of the body of the heroine, Ira, as a 'country' invaded by the hand of the 25 Such texts, it can be argued, are only partly modernist, for they emphasize the conventions they contravene. The assertion of Ralph Cohen, that 'the very concept of transgression presupposes an acknowledgement of boundaries or limit' ('Do Postmodern Genres Exist?', Genre, 20, 1987, 3-4, pp. 24I-58 [p. 246]), is one which emphasizes this paradoxical affirmation of conventions. 26 Limonov is a modernist writer only in content, not in form; his genres are stylistically quite conservative, despite his choice of 'shocking' subject-matter. With the exception of his Dnevnik neudachnika, i1i sekretnaia tetrad', New York, I 982, a collection of short pieces, ranging from paragraphs and haiku-like three-line pieces, his texts tend to follow a standard Bildungsroman line. 27 The title is Russkaja [sic] krasavitsa (first word in Latin script, second in Cyrillic) in the I 990 version.</page><page sequence="9">224 SALLY DALTON-BROWN doctor seeking to test her pregnancy.28 The good-time girl and beauty Ira is depicted as the Virgin Mary, as Russia herself, endlessly despoiled by carnal Communism, which seeks, in its desire for power, to be the ultimate possessor. Irina's suicide in order to join her dead lover is an example of the, sterility of such possessive love; she dies before giving birth.29 There is no alternative, no way out (despite the novel's skilful moving of the boundary between death and life), and the ending of the text returns the reader, with a 'hello', to the beginning. Postmodernist literature is literature which devours itself, or dismem- bers itself, as can be seen in texts by the propagators of grotesque prose, such as Vladimir Sorokin. Sorokin has spoken of his work as 'conceptualist', meaning that he describes not the reality ofphenomena, but the reality of one's relationship to phenomena; but his prose is not so much the prose of subjectivity as of destructive subjectivism, in which the subject annihilates itself.30 However, Sorokin's body-texts like Erofeev's have political referentiality; Sorokin's Tridtsataia liubov' Mariny (I995) is a novel in which the body of his heroine, Marina, becomes the 'criterion of ideological truth'.3' Moskva-Petushki, Russkaia krasavitsa and many of the grotesque works are 'closed' texts, ending with finitude, reduction, an inescapable return to one's starting point; one might argue that a dominant metaphor of avant-garde writing is that of a closed circle in which birth and death form a 'locked' narrative, as epitomized by the hanging, pregnant body of Erofeev's poor Ira, who has chosen the only escape from her life and from the narrative, or by the plot of 'Telo Anny, ili konets russkogo avangarda', in which a modernist writer is 'swallowed' by a woman.32 28 The content of Erofeev's Russkaia krasavitsa, or Sorokin's Serdtsa chetyrekh, is undeniably shocking to a Russian literary readership unused to sexual description, let alone cannibalism, but the texts in stylistic terms are modernist only to a degree. Ira's stream-of- consciousness monologue displays the fragmentation associated with the modernist style, but the text has, as Porter has argued, 'an essential Russianness', eschewing 'any base imitation of western risque writing', Russia's Alternative Prose, p. 150. 29 I disagreee with Robert Porter that she achieves a kind of immortality, ibid., p.

In Erofeev's 'Zhenkin tezaurus' (I993) the son of a degenerate father wakes to find his own sperm dripping from his father's lips; a neat transgression of two Russian taboos (homosexuality and incest) ends with a telling image of fertile potential swallowed by the past, the seed returned to the body which gave it life, and the fact that the swallowing figure is a male rendering (unlike 'Telo Anny', in which it is a woman) the image one of greater sterility. Apart from the text of infiltration and closure, modernist Russian prose has also produced works of fragmentation, in which the result is much the same - a depiction of destruction but is achieved through different means. Verbal dismemberment is the focus. Sorokin often slips into meaningless babble, as in Serdtsa chetyrekh; Viktor Erofeev's recent texts included in the compilation Izbrannye iii Karmannyi apokalipsis (I 993) show this arresting concern with reducing the verbal skeleton of the text to splintered bones, as does Valeriia Narbikova with her texts of deliberate irrationalism (see the first page of her Plan pervogo litsa, I993, for a broad hint towards the importance of the irrational).34 Despite the label of 'empty wordsmithery', which one influential critic has attached to her work,35 it can be argued that there is an innate perversity to Narbikova's pose, seen for example in the creation of metonymic images followed by a denial of any link which might underpin metonymy, a creation of meaning which is then denied. Narbikova plays a teasing game when she hints at pattern, telling the reader that 'a text will remain from us' ('ot nas ostanetsia tekst') 'as a witness of the fact that we existed', a statement rendered rather indistinct by the next phrases, expressive of a catch-22 situation. The text will be 'an incomplete witness, because, when it's a matter of the text, any full witness is unjust, and if it is just, then it is incomplete'.36 33 See V. Kuritsyn, 'Postmodernism: The New Primitive Culture': 'I like the line taken by the young critic Stanislav Lvovsky, who has noted that a snake- devouring itself by its tail may give itself quite a hard time before it finishes the job.

In the work of Liudmila Petrushevskaia, within her earthy, intensely physical (for abortion, drunkenness, dirt and, particularly, illness are omnipresent) stream-of-consciousness narration, fact is pared away. Names, dates, and consecutive narration are kept to a minimum as Petrushevskaia emphasizes the fragility of the linguistic 'shell' within which the paranoid or grieving thoughts of her characters are to be found; the shell may crack at any minute, allowing consciousness to be swallowed by madness. Perched above the abyss in a text such as Petrushevskaia's I992 Booker Prize-nominated Vremia noch', the protagonist, Anna, finally does crack, loses verbal control, and the text fades away into unpunctuated chaos. Similarly, Vladimir Makanin's 1993 Booker-winning Stol, pokytyi suknom, i s grafinom posredine ends with the narrative fading, unpunctuated, into the void, into the silence of self-destruction. The death of the protagonists of both Vremia noch' and Stol, like the death of Erofeev's Ira in Russkaia krasavitsa, or the already dead Milashevich in Linii sud'by, is one form of finitude. The deliberate creation of words which loop around themselves in tortuous logic, strangling themselves to death, or which lose all form until they become shouts, screams, strings of meaningless letters, is another form of anti- creation. Amidst all this destruction, where is the postmodernist game that allows the character to -enter and to win, as in Nabokov's Zashchita Luzhina (I930), in which Luzhin, arguably, enters a higher level of cosmic play (for Luzhin's suicide may be yet another move on the celestial chess board)? In the work of Viktor Pelevin, one finds the construction of an artificial universe which at every turn calls into question the nature of its creation. There is no way out, but the insertion of a strong element of humour turns this Russian postmodern- ist grimness into a more lightly ludic type of text; despair becomes ludicrous. Pelevin's texts deal lightly with philosophical ideas, in particular the epistemological relationship of observer to phenomena. His texts are metafictional (and, as part of textual self-reflexivity, one finds that his characters are conscious parodies of socialist realist 'creators'). Ultimately, his inventive texts are 'joke' texts; his 'Zhizn' nasekomykh' is in parts a verbal cartoon strip, relying on bizarre spatial distortions between the size of characters, and on a rapid, distorted movement which takes the reader from episode to episode as if from cartoon frame to frame.37 37 Somewhat like a Tom and Jerry animation drawn by Hieronymous Bosch, perhaps? This article, it should be noted, does not include reference to Pelevin's latest works, published after 1993, that is, the three works published in 1995-96 after Pelevin's brief absence from journal pages in I 994.</page><page sequence="12">VIKTOR PELEVIN 227 Pelevin's textual type or mode of writing can be called that of the 'reverse image' text. His work is highly visual, and his texts usually focus on a few well-chosen metaphors often only one extended metaphor per text, as in 'Zheltaia strela' or 'Prints Gosplan' - which lose their status as created images and become 'real', reversing the status of image/phenomenon (or signifier/signified). Reality, however, is never ultimately. signified in this simulated world. What man has created is shown at times to be the creator of man's universe, as Pelevin follows his own mocking line of thought on man's ability to believe precisely what he wants to and the consequences thereof. Pelevin structures character and reality in his text in a symbiotic relationship, manipulating the ideas of real and unreal with fluidity and unexpected- ness, dislocating the smooth flow of event and circumstance in order to show his characters as endlessly transitional, moving from the status of man as creator to man as created. As the reader finds himself manipulated into the reflexive position occasioned by the conscious artificiality of Pelevin's prose, he realizes that humour has become the main concern. The texts dissolve into mirth; the image in the mirror laughs back in a carnival anarchy which offers some solace, for carnival laughter is eternal and death-defying. The texts reveal themselves for what they really are: comic-book reflections of the world. This is pop- art which, like Warhol's or Lichtenstein's pictures, offers its own images -as ridiculously sacred, yet it is pop-art told with a Nabokovian artistry which delights. Pelevin's concern with man as creator and created often has political overtones. Pelevin has shown a definite concern with propaganda in his short story collection Sinii fonar' (i 99 i) and in 'Omon Ra' (I 992); even his 'Zhizn' nasekomykh' (I993) can be read in part as a veiled political allegory. His political humour is best seen in 'Deviatyi son Very Pavlovny', the title of which is ironic, for instead of the brave new world of Chernyshevskii's Vera, we have the life and thoughts of a lavatory attendant in a story which looks at changes under perestroika through the changes in a men's lavatory. The place is transformed: 'instead of the severe lavatory pans of the conqueror socialism, some kind of pinky-violet banqueting bowls were put in, and by the entrance a turnstile, like in the metro, only entry cost not five, but ten kopecks'.38 In 'Deviatyi son', Pelevin also addresses his primary area of interest - solipsism. Vera's friend and mentor, another cleaner called Maniasha (a parody of Chernyshevskii's Masha), has inculcated a solipsistic philosophy in Vera, who now believes that 'we create the 38 V.

One must remember, however, that this concept has a corollary: 'from one point of view, we really do create everything around us, but from the other we ourselves are simply the reflection of what surrounds us' (Sinii fonar', p. 148). In Pelevin's 'Oruzhie vozmezdiia', the solipsistic concept is expressed more poetically. The story focuses on the German propaganda claim to have developed a major new weapon towards the end of World War II. Pelevin 'quotes' from a certain P. Spetsiuk's book, 'Pamiat' ognennykh let', in which the true nature of the 'weapon' is revealed: When a great number of people believe in the reality of a certain object (or process), it begins to manifest itself: in the monastery religious miracles occur [. . .]. If you place a candle before a mirror, you will see its reflection. But if you could by some unknown means introduce the reflection of the candle into the mirror - for the laws of physics not to be broken, a candle is duty bound to appear out of empty air, before the mirror. (Siniifonar', pp. 288-89) Thus, when rumours about the new weapon began, the weapon itself became manifest. Pelevin incorporates into this concept both a political and a metaphysical significance, referring both to the power of propaganda and of solipsism. Propaganda is also the main theme of his povest', 'Omon Ra' (I992), a text based on the Soviet space pro- gramme.39 Driven by the need to prove that they are not technologically backward by comparison with the Americans, the Soviets plan a mission to place a transmitter on the moon that will broadcast the words 'Peace', 'Lenin' and 'USSR' to the world as a sign of Soviet achievement. For the hero, Omon Krivomazov, whose preferred surname is 'Ra', because he would like to be like the Egyptian sun-god,40 the mission will be fatal. He and the other cosmonauts hardly prepared by a diet of Soviet rhetoric about the moon and close study of the works of Lenin - set off, whiling away the hours during this technologically complex mission by discussing pop music and sleeping. When Omon 39 'Lunokhod', published as a separate story in Siniifonar' (pp. 265-7 I), appears as part of the narrative in 'Omon Ra', Znamza, 1992, 5, pp. I I-63 (pp. 36-40). On the text, see S. Chuprinin, 'Sbyvsheesia nebyvshee', Znamia, 1993, 9, pp. i8i-88 (pp. I82-83); noting that 'Omon Ra' has been read as a satire on the Soviet space programme, Chuprinin still prefers to call Pelevin's work 'pure art'. Kostyrko, in his discussion of 'Omon Ra', also agrees that it is not overtly political, and argues that it is about 'metaphysical and etemal' concepts. S. Kostyrko, 'Chistoe pole literatury', Jovyi mir, I992, I2, pp. 250-59 (pp. 256-57). See also A. Melikhov, review of 'Omon Ra', Neva, 1993, 5-6, pp. 335-36. 40 'Omon Ra', p. 33. All quotations are taken from the Znamia edition (see footnote above; further references will appear in the text in parentheses). Omon's first name is given to him by his father in the hopes that his son will be a policeman (from the acronym OMON, which stands for 'Otriad militsii osobogo naznacheniia'); Omon's brother, whom his father hopes will be a diplomat, is given the even more ridiculous name of Ovir, from the acronym OVIR, for 'Otdel viz i registratsii inostrannykh grazhdan'.</page><page sequence="14">VIKTOR PELEVIN 229 steps out onto the surface of the moon, protected against vacuum only by swimming goggles and nose plugs, he expects to die. Certainly he does not expect to find himself alive, albeit the target of bullets. Fleeing, he stumbles upon a stage set where another drama of Soviet space supremacy is being played out against a carefully blacked-out back- ground, and realizes that he has never left the earth at all; the entire procedure has been a gigantic farce. Even Laika, the dog supposedly sent up in one of the first satellites and left to starve to death, makes an appearance (dressed in a major-general's uniform, and with two orders of Lenin) in this Soviet game of propaganda bluff. Pelevin's ironic view of Soviet history and propaganda is explored in several stories in Siniifonar': Russian history now becomes peopled with characters such as a cocaine-sniffing Red officer guarding the Smolnyi in October of 19 I 7 ('Khrustal'nyi mir'), or filled with experiments such as the one described in 'Otkrovenie Kregera', based on the idea that Lenin's book Lev Tolstoi as a Mirror of the Revolution is a coded prophecy about the progress of socialism (this farcical story is somewhat reminiscent of Will Self's 'Quantity Theory of Insanity', with its madly experimental logic). The genre of 'Otkrovenie Kregera' is a wonderful mixture of letters, minutes, service reports, recommendations, decod- ing, and taped recordings. Although many of the texts have an orthodox siuzhet in which plot is constructed so as to move the reader towards climactic points, Pelevin's texts are ludic passages in which rules are constantly being overturned. In the story 'Mittel'spil', it turns out that the two men and two prostitutes depicted in the text have all had sex changes.4' Identity is never a constant, as we see in 'Problema vervolka v srednei polose' in which the narrator changes into a werewolf (with a shadow in the shape of a human - whereas the humans possess animal-shaped shadows). Introducing the Berkeleian concern with whether reality can exist if there is no observer to observe,42 Pelevin's narrator questions 'who' is the observer ('Zheltaia strela', p. I17). In his 'Zhizn' nasekomykh', reality moves between the human and the animal in a text in which anthropomorphism is not only satirically motivated but is also a reinforcement of the flexibility of identity. The epigraph to the text, taken from Brodskii,43 suggests this; as the world fades around the observer the hum of insects fills the silence, and another entire world is 41 This story appeared alongside two other Pelevin pieces in translation in Glas, I993, 4, although in a rather different version. 42 V.

After all, the world of insects is the kind of world which the philosophical moth Mitia would describe, were he to write a book ('Zhizn' nasekomykh', p. 2 I). One can compare this text with Liudmila Petrushevskaia's Dikie zhivotnye skazki, which began appearing in Stolitsa 22 (I993) and which are being published at the rate of one an issue delightfully humorous stories about a range of characters such as the chess-playing leopard Eduard, the hyena Zoia and the mosquito Tomka. The plots are simple but effective, seemingly moral tales (like Solzhenitsyn's animal fables), but are not to be taken seriously.46 This is a comic-book world, like Pelevin's. Pelevin's own attitude to literature is mocking, like that of many postmodernists (and modernists). In a hilarious scene from 'Zhizn' nasekomykh', Sam (an American mosquito) and Natasha (a fly with hopes of hooking a foreigner who will rescue her from Russia) indulge in sex. As they murmur erotically at each other, Natasha's mother drones set phrases of literary criticism from the Magadan Ant, a local newspaper, the jargonistic cliches forming a ridiculous background to the groaning pleasure of the two insects. Pelevin's dig at literary criticism is not confined to the droning ant's recitation; two characters (who turn out later to be minute organisms within the cigarette smoked by the mosquito Sam in Pelevin's spatially distorted world) discuss postmodernism itself and suggest that it is something dreamed up by bored watchmen (p. 41). Pelevin also has an insect play Chekhov's Gaev in a surreal version in which the hapless ex-landowner ends up with an aquarium on his head, placed there by 'Justina', and dropping a bamboo sword (7Zhizn' nasekomykh', p. 4); a group of insects hold a Proust festival, which quickly appears to turn into a drunken orgy, and in 'Mardongi', Pelevin suggests slyly that literary critics use computers in order to analyse works, stating parodically that: 'the latest research on an IBM ES-554o has established a definite link between the word "harmony", repeated in the book, and the ritual of preparing 44 Not a happy combination for critic Pavel Basinskii, who places Pelevin's 'Zhizn' nasekomykh', rather unfairly, with Sorokin's grotesque prose.

Competitiveness, acts of violence, betrayal, near misses with death, are all commonplaces of this insect world but what remains in the mind are the lighter moments - the Elvis-fan rat Nadezhda enrolling for 'rock 'n' roll' lessons ('Elvis Presli', Stolitsa, 1993, 3 I, p. 57), or the leopard Eduard being faced with a paternity suit brought by the mother of fifteen mice who live in Eduard's sock-drawer ('Dedushka Edik', Stolitsa, I993, 52, p. 58).</page><page sequence="16">VIKTOR PELEVIN 23I boiled dog, the national dish of the Navajo Indians' (Siniifonar', p. I 79). Pelevin perhaps hints here to the critic that analysis of his texts is unlikely to provide any major insights. The blurred boundary between life and death is the most significant focus for Pelevin, who teases the reader by introducing this profound theme only to deal with it ironically, just as he does with any other significant concepts to which he refers (whether it be Egyptian mythology, Teilhard de Chardin, .or the work of Berdiaev). In 'Buben verkhnogo mira' he describes corpses being resurrected in order to be auctioned off as husbands for girls suffering a local shortage of men. He discusses the consciousness of a shed in the absolutely charming 'Zhizn' i prikliucheniia saraia Nomer XII', in which a shed whose greatest desire is to be a bicycle finds himself locked in battle with a barrel of pickled cucumbers which attempts to stifle his soul and reduce it to vegetative subconsciousness (the shed wins, and does eventually become a bicycle). In 'Vstroennyi pominatel" he discusses an avant-garde art movement called 'vibrationalism' in which the artists creates a lifelike puppet with a 'remote destruct and a built-in memory of death'. Vibrationalism is concerned with the idea of whether the puppet can hear the ringing sound of approaching death, and understand its significance (Siniifonar', p. 2 I 7). The question hinted at here is whether even an artificial construct has consciousness, and can comprehend the awful threat of annihilation of that consciousness. In 'Vesti iz Nepala', a radio broadcast announces to the assembled characters that they are in fact dead, and the comment is made: 'O, the horror of Soviet death! What strange games people play while they perish! Not knowing anything except life, they take death to be life' (Siniifonar', p. 285). 'Vesti iz Nepala' begins and ends with the same words; the characters are caught in an eternal loop as life and death constantly twist and turn in ourobourotic fluidity. In 'Sinii fonar" the question is asked 'how can you tell who's alive and who's dead'? (Sinii fonar', p. i63), a question which Pelevin rephrases as 'how can one know who's awake and who is dreaming?', the premise of the wonderfully funny story 'Spi'. It appears that the blurring of the creator/created divide has returned the reader, even in Pelevin's energetic prose, to a literature of closure, from which there is no way out, only an endless circularity or movement from dream to waking, life to death. In the story 'Ukhriab' Pelevin shows a rather bleak view of man's closed existence. The hero, one Maralov, has a revelation about the structure of the universe late one night. Waking the next morning he finds he cannot remember precisely what he had understood, but he can remember the meaningless word 'ukhriab', which starts to haunt him, appearing on every page of any book he tries to read, or occurring</page><page sequence="17">232 SALLY DALTON-BROWN in conversations.47 Maralov thinks at first that 'ukhriab' stands for the substance of the universe, some kind of being which has swallowed everything, but then thinks that there is something else which has torn through existence, making a hole in Maralov himself; the 'ukhriab' is something more: Ukhriab - was, firstly, a sound wave, secondly, something in letters, and thirdly, a meaningful combination, existing to cover the hole [..] Ukhriab it's nothing other than a symbol [.. .]. And it's necessary to reveal it with the help of the symbol itself, that is, the ukhriab. (Siniifonar', p. 248) The 'ukhriab' is a symbol which can only be understood through the symbol itself, in other words, a self-referential icon (a type offantik, perhaps). Pelevin here discusses language itself, its ultimately meaning- less nature, how it exists only to 'paper over the holes' which represent for us the terrifying nature of reality. It is not surprising that Maralov, who has arrived at the place where language is but a flimsy shield against reality, where words, both written and spoken, constantly form the gnomic 'ukhriab', should die, for he has lost language, therefore meaning, and reality. Maralov journeys to a place where he sees a hole which becomes the 'ukhriab', jumps in and dies, his body being found some days later. Life is language, suggests Pelevin, life is the created image which then creates man's universe. Existence is a journey towards discovery of the ultimately nonsensical nature of reality, its 'ukhriab'. The human race is depicted as travelling, hopelessly confused, through a universe the key to which has been lost. In his I 993 text 'Zheltaia strela', life is likened to a train in which we sit backwards. Reality unfolds in a reverse order, as Pelevin suggests by numbering the twelve sections of the text backwards. (For the purpose of this text, Pelevin rather amusingly creates an entire culture around train images (including funeral rites passengers are tipped out of windows together with their seat cushions): passengers sing Boris Grebenshchikov's 'Poezd v ogne', read Pasternak's JVa rannikh poezdakh or a book about train trips in India.) The serious message is clearly evident; man is a passenger of time travelling 'towards a destroyed bridge', i.e. towards death ('Zheltaia strela', p. Ioo), and the question of whether one can alight from this train is moot. The protagonist, Andrei, does so, but shortly before describing Andrei's descent from the train, Pelevin states that all journeys are perhaps over before they begin, calling into question the validity of Andrei's new journey ('Zheltaia strela', p. I 2 I). 47 Pelevin teases the reader by suggesting that this meaningless word may have something to do with the two words 'ukhab' and 'khrebet' ('bump', and 'spine' or 'ridge').</page><page sequence="18">VIKTOR PELEVIN 233 Life is many things to Pelevin: death, a train journey, the passage of a ball of dung across the sky, a computer game (as in 'Prints Gosplan', in which the narrator is simultaneously within a computer game, attempting to ascend all twelve levels of the game in order to reach the room with a princess, and living a normal life in a technical institute). Or perhaps life is a form of Darwinian struggle for survival of the fittest ('Zhizn' nasekomykh', p. 60), a text which is no more, we are told, than 'the hallucination of the drug addict Petrov', who is himself the hallucination of a drunken starshina ('Zhizn' nasekomykh', p. 38). One thing is for sure, that one can never know, as Mitia the philosophical moth states after a strange experience in the 'tunnel of eternity'. The experience is vivid, but fades, the knowledge disappears like a sweet which has been eaten; all that is left is the sweet wrapper (fantik, p. 54). Like Milashevich's fantiki, Pelevin's texts provide surface rather than sense, image rather than content or referent; in this ludic literature the medium is the message. Pelevin suggests to the reader that with each text there is another game. Yet, press 'enter', and you find yourself not in another level of the game, but back at the beginning, or dead. Is this mockery arising from despair, or simply a good joke carried through to annihilation? Pelevin's postmodernism does not allow any conclusions; the terror of the void (of which 'reality' may ultimately consist) and the echo of ludic laughter coexist in this prose of provocative possibility and amusing finality.</page></plain_text>
