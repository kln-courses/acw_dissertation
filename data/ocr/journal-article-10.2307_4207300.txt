<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEER, Vol. LJV, No. 3,July 1976 Despotism and Anarchy: The Sociological Thought of L. I. Mechnikov JAMES D. WHITE IT iS understandable that when Lev Mechnikov's book La Civilisation et les grands fleuves historiques1 appeared in I889 elaborating a theory of Oriental despotism and hydraulic societies, it should have aroused comparatively little interest. It is rather more remarkable, in view of the subsequent popularity of this theory, that Mechnikov and his ideas should have been allowed to pass so completely into oblivion. His name has been overlooked not only by historians of social thought but even by Karl Wittfogel in the survey of earlier contributions to the theory of Oriental despotism in his otherwise definitive work on that subject.2 Mechnikov, however, merits study not merely by virtue of being a predecessor of Wittfogel, but of being an original thinker in his own right. There is no detailed biography of Mechnikov. This is a pity for few scholars can have led a more eventful life, one which linked all the major revolutionary movements in the latter part of the nine- teenth century, as can be seen from the biographical sketch compiled by his friend and associate llisee Reclus. His theoretical writings are a kind of commentary on his active championship of freedom and equality and on his travels to the farthest corners of the globe. Lev Il'ich Mechnikov was the elder brother of the famous Russian biologist Il'ya Mechnikov. He was born in St Petersburg in I838, the son of a Ukrainian landowner of Rumanian origin.3 His early years were spent in Kharkov where he entered the University in 1856 to study medicine. His participation in student disturbances, however, led to his being expelled from the university in his first year. He then went to St Petersburg and entered the Medico-Surgical Academy and later St Petersburg University. Since the study of medicine by no means exhausted his varied interests, he also enrolled at the Institute of Oriental Languages and the Academy of Arts. These varied James D. White is a member of the Institute of Soviet and East European Studies, University of Glasgow. 1 lion Metchnikoff, La Civilisation et les grandsfleuves historiques, avec une pr6face de M.

WHITE academic pursuits were curtailed in I858 when he was expelled from St Petersburg as he had been driven from Kharkov, for his active part in student disturbances.4 In the same year as the abrupt termination of his education, Mechnikov was fortunate enough to be employed as interpreter on a Russian diplomatic mission to the Near East, a function for which his brief connection with the Institute of Oriental Languages had pre- pared him. It must be added that throughout his life Mechnikov had a marvellous linguistic facility, mastering at various times the chief languages of Europe, so that he spoke and wrote English and French as perfectly as his native Russian. He is also said to have assimilated Japanese with great rapidity.5 Although Mechnikov was obviously well suited for a career as an interpreter, he was not consti- tuted to move in diplomatic circles. Following a duel and some harsh wvords with his superiors his employment was terminated to the great satisfaction of both parties.6 By i86o Mechnikov had made his way to Italy where he spent some time in Venice to further his study of art begun while at St Petersburg. It was not long, however, before he made contact with Garibaldi and joined his forces, taking part in the liberation of Naples. He was badly wounded by an exploding mine at Volturno in October I 86o but, even before he had fully recovered his health, he threw hiim- self into the task of working for the liberation of the Slav peoples from Austrian and Turkish rule. In this connection he made the acquain- tance of Bakunin and thereafter conducted propaganda work in Italy and Spain on behalf of the anarchists, a task in which his gifts as a translator and interpreter were put to a more congenial use than they had been for official Russian delegations. During the eighteen- sixties he also contributed several articles on political themes to Herzen's Kolokol and to Chernyshevsky's Sovremennik.7 While the occupation of an anarchist revolutionary was absorbing it was not particularly remunerative, so in I874 Mechnikov, having quickly learnt Chinese and Japanese, accepted the invitation of the Japanese Minister of Education to take charge of a school in Ieddo specializing in teaching Russian to Japanese students. In this en- deavour he had considerable success and when he returned to Europe in I876 he brought with him the manuscript of L'Empire japonais based on his travels in the East and illustrated throughout with his own drawings and sketches, some of them in the Japanese style.8 4 Rlis6e Reclus, preface to La Civilisation . . ., p. vi. 6 'Nekrolog' (Obshcheye delo, Geneva, I888, no. 109, p. 12). 6 Reclus, op. cit., p. vii. 7 ibid., p. ix. 8 ibid., p. x.

The lectures which he gave at Neuchatel appeared the following year in book form under the title La Civilisation et les grands fleuves historiques with an introduction written by his friend and colleague ltlisee Reclus. It is a work which bears the imprint both of Mechnikov's interest in geography and his commitment to anarchism. Mechnikov's life and career is not unlike that of the more famous figures in the anarchist movement with whom he came into contact. Before his voyage to the Far East his exploits in Italy had brought him close to Bakunin, and as in Bakunin's case his anarchism was strongly influenced by the ideas of Proudhon. Mechnikov, however, was un- able to accept Proudhon uncritically since the latter's paradoxical and metaphysical mode of argument inspired by Hegel's dialectics, seemed to him too imprecise a tool for the analysis of complex social phenomena. Proudhon, moreover, it appeared to Mechnikov, was at his best in denouncing existing society. But, Mechnikov objected: 'It would be quite insufficient to understand that a great deal of evil, ignorance, brute force and arbitrariness inhere in all of our social institutions, if there were no indications, no guarantee of the possi- bility, if not certainty, of something other in the future.'10 The attempt to provide precisely that guarantee occupied Mechnikov for some time to come. In the latter part of his life the evolution of Mechnikov's views parallels almost exactly that of Kropotkin. Both men were travellers, geographers and ethnologists and in both cases their political ideas were inspired by the scientific discoveries of their day, and especially by the awakening interest in the science of man and of society. The humanistic response to the social implications of the works of Darwin and of Malthus led Kropotkin and Mechnikov separately and almost simultaneously to put forward as an alternative the concept of co- operation as a factor in the evolution of human society.11 There are consequently many similarities between Kropotkin's Mutual Aid and Mechnikov's later writings, especially his article 'Revolution and 9 ibid. 10 L.

WHITE Evolution'.'2 Both Mechnikov and his more illustrious contemporary were concerned not only to demonstrate the possibility of a future society based on co-operation, but also to explain the evolution of earlier societies using the same principle. The premises of social co- operation laid down by Mechnikov in 'Revolution and Evolution' led naturally to the development of his theory of history elaborated in La Civilisation et les grandsfieuves historiques which appeared three years later. In 'Revolution and Evolution' Mechnikov delineated what he considered to be the true province of sociology, and in doing so strove to make precise what had been left vague by both Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. He was concerned in particular to define where biology ceased and sociology began. Mechnikov con- sidered Comte's definition rather unsatisfactory since Comte chose to regard social science as applicable only to human beings, thus deliberately creating a gulf between natural and social science. Arbitrarily selecting the human individual as the starting point for his enquiries, Comte observed that one part of human activity was based upon egoistic instincts such as the need for nutrition or personal preservation in general. These instincts belonged to the biological domain. To sociology Comte assigned the remainder, that portion of human activity which was not rooted in individual self-satisfaction, but what he termed 'altruistic instincts'. Comte believed that the physiological roots of altruism lay in sexual attraction, the natural result of which was the association of a male and a female for the preservation of the species-an end not personal to either of them. For Mechnikov the only virtue of Comte's definition of sociology wYas its implicit inclusion of the phenomenon of association or co- operation. Since Mechnikov did not accept that sociology is the study of the human phenomenon alone and argued that among animals social groupings based on co-operation take precedence over the family, his definition is much wider than Comte's. Indeed, Mechnikov states: 'Natural science teaches us that association is the law of every existence. What we call society in common speech is only a particular case of that general law."13 For Mechnikov, therefore, wherever there is association, there is ground for sociological study, even at the lowest end of the evolutionary scale, since 'to botanists and zoologists is due the capital discovery of the unquestionable fact that (with the single exception of the lowest, uni-cellular ones) organisms are societies.' The human individual, in so far as he consists of associa- 12 L.

Thus Mechnikov argued: If sociology is to interfere with such matters, it should be only to enquire what is the mysterious reason inducing the elementary plastoids or cells to unite together, and thus form those primordial societies which are, perhaps, the starting point of sociological evaluation, but which cer- tainly are the starting point of all progress in vegetable as well as animal life. The reason seems the more mysterious because such aggregations are by no means imposed on the cells or plastoids for their personal preservation, since we see myriads of those 'absolute individuals' multi- plying and prospering in their unsociable loneliness, and even attaining to such a complex structure that eminent observers even doubt whether they really are monocellular.15 But if French Positivism had erred by drawing too rigid and artificial a boundary between science and sociology, no less serious was the misapprehension propagated by Herbert Spencer that, since society was an organism, sociology could be absorbed by zoology. Admittedly, Spencer had cautioned that society should not be con- founded with biological organisms, offering as essential distinctions the fact that biological organisms are discrete, whereas plants and animals are concrete and also that, unlike biological organisms, society's sensibility was not concentrated in a specific sensorium, each of its members being capable of experiencing pleasure or pain on its own account. Since Mechnikov did not consider these objec- tions to the identity of the two provinces insuperable, he found it quite understandable that Spencer should have been regarded as belonging to the school that admitted no division between social and biological organisms.'6 If sociology is to be regarded as an extension of biology, 'if it must be seen in terms of Darwin's "survival of the fittest"' then the impli- cations for political theory are plain. Whereas, according to Mechni- kov, the political programme derived from French Positivism is 'a kind of learned patriarchy, somewhat like a scientific papalism or the Chinese Tribunal of Ceremonies, the 'struggle for life' school puts forth the Kulturkampf, either Social Democratic or Bismarckian."17 Spencer himself was more inclined to favour the old laissez faire doctrine of no governmental or revolutionary interference. All three of these political variants were, of course, abhorrent to Mechnikov, as philosophies which had their roots in an erroneous understanding of the nature of society. While Spencer had come nearer to the truth than Comte by emphasizing the continuity 16 ibid., p. 424. 16 ibid., p. 425- 17 ibid.</page><page sequence="6">400 JAMES D. WHITE between the realm of biology and sociology, his failure to perceive exactly where the links lay led him and his interpreters to apply the principles of biology to society where they were inappropriate. Comte, if only artificially, had at least posited sociology as an autonomous zone. Mechnikov, however, would not deny that biological laws had any relevance to society: the areas of operation of physical, biological and sociological laws overlap. Mechnikov avers: It seems plain that we ought not to search for any natural region or province which could be called sociological throughout, and thus monopolized by merely sociological studies, because there is no such region in the world which could be styled organic in the absolute sense of the word, exclusive of phenomena of an inferior organic character."8 The world as a whole demonstrates such unity and continuity that there is no definite point where the sphere of the natural sciences ends and biology begins, just as there is no point at which biology gives way entirely to sociology. The best reason for distinguishing biology strictly from the physical sciences is that one cannot satisfactorily account for organic phenomena by Newtonian physics alone: the surplus is so great that a specific principle must be sought. The same is true for biology and sociology. The borderline, Mechnikov suggests, between the various branches of science is a cognitive one arising from the impossibility of subsuming cosmic phenomena under a single law or principle.'9 Here Mechnikov contends that co-operation, whether between individual living cells or human beings cannot be accounted for by the Darwinian principle of the struggle for survival. Indeed, Mechni- kov argues, one cannot perceive any benefit accruing to the cells or plastoids from their aggregating together and thus forming the first rudiments of a social or collective organism instead of pursuing their individual advancement, were there not a principle quite distinct from struggle pervading cosmic evolution in its organic stages. That principle, the consensus of a number of more or less individualized forces arriving at an end, not personal to one but common to all, was, according to Mechnikov, specific to sociology. He conceded, however, that it may be the struggle for life which impels individual men or animals to form societies, but this is simply an example of how the realms of biology and sociology impinge. Just as the laws of war are not identical with the terms of an alliance, the phenomenon of co-operation demands a principle distinct from that of the stimulus which called it into being.20 18 ibid., p. 429. 19 ibid., p. 431. 20 ibid.</page><page sequence="7">DESPOTISM AND ANARCHY 401 Mechnikov perceived three scientific laws which govern the world and correspond to three divisions of phenomena to which they apply: Newtonian gravity which is descriptive of what he terms 'anorganic' phenomena; biology, which belongs to the organic world; and sociology which covers the phenomenon of co-operation.21 Mechnikov's view of society, therefore, based as it was on the principle of co-operation was a highly optimistic one for the future development of mankind. The inescapable conclusion is that society in its very essence is inimical to any form of compulsion and that the absence of authority does not imply that society will break down into lawless anarchy where the weak are at the mercy of the strong and each individual will at once join in a furious scramble to satisfy his own private appetites and passions. This apocalyptic vision stems from an erroneous conception of society and the elements which com- pose it. On the contrary, the removal of authority simply means that the law specifically governing society, the law of co-operation, would then come into full play. Society would need no ordering or organizing, because society as such was order and organization. Here then was an argument for an equitable and just social order with no need to appeal to ethical or moral criteria, but based firmly on the objectivity of science. The question which springs to mind, and which Mechnikov left largely unanswered in 'Revolution and Evolution', is: if the essence of society is free co-operation, how does one account for the presence of organizations of social compulsion and control? Is the State, for example, to be considered a non-sociological entity? The answer, Mechnikov suggested, is that the phenomenon of co-operation, like society itself, undergoes a peculiar evolution in which elements of compulsion are gradually discarded until the goal of complete voluntary association is reached. The more primitive societies will, therefore, be distinguished by the presence of a greater degree of compulsion, and the more advanced societies with less, so that social evolution would naturally culminate in the complete anarchy of free co-operation. This elegant socio-historical system had much to commend it from Mechnikov's point of view as an anarchist, but was sadly lacking for Mechnikov the anthropologist. Quite simply it was untrue that the more primitive the society, the more oppression it suffered; and social progress was not invariably accompanied by increased free- dom. As Mechnikov admitted: Examples can be gathered in history and ethnology of societies not highly civilized, the members of which enjoy a freedom unknown to the 21 ibid., p. 435.</page><page sequence="8">402 JAMES D. WHITE most liberal European monarchies and republics in our days: such were the communities of Cossacks in Southern Russia in the seventeenth century, and such are . . . the Abyssinian Shakos. But these people con- tent themselves with co-operation in a degree which would appear very meagre from our civilized point of view. On the other hand, we see geographical regions-e.g. the Lower Valley of the Nile, or the Yang-tze- Kiang and Hoang-ho-where physical conditions require from the in- habitants far more co-operation than they were able to yield freely and consciously in their state of civilization; and, in fact, those countries have always been, and are still, classical for their despotism . . .22 Even if one allowed that those peoples who had endured despotism were the ones who lit the torch of civilization and progress, it was still necessary to explain why social compulsion should be associated with some peoples and not with others. This was the task undertaken by Mechnikov in his La Civilisation et les grands fleuves historiques. In this work Mechnikov reiterated the premises which he had established in 'Revolution and Evolution' on the nature of society, namely that '. . . co-operation is the principal characteristic of social life. If, in the realm of biology, beings more or less individualized, from the living cell to man himself, struggle for existence or for some private and personal end, in the sociological sphere, on the contrary, they unite their efforts to achieve a common purpose.'23 Thus, Mechnikov argued, in this sense the domain of sociology is to be found wherever there is the phenomenon of co-operation; though in this sense one could not define precisely the dividing line between individual organisms and societies. As Mechnikov had already explained, in his terminology two men carrying a burden might be considered as a sociological unit, whereas a hundred men lodging in one house for their lifetime or meeting together every day for twenty years at the Library of the British Museum would not; they would simply be a collection of individuals.24 Mechnikov then elaborated his concept of an ascending order of types of co-operation. The lowest type, which he calls 'mechanical' co-operation is distinguished by the presence of connective tissues, fibres or membranes and is to be found chiefly in polycellular organisms. Next comes the intermediary type of co-operation termed by Mechnikov 'physiological necessity' resulting from the differentia- tion of cells and organs, owing to which no individual member of the whole organism could exist without the others. The highest stage of free association is attained when biological units contract a union together, the purpose of which is not for the personal benefit of any 22 ibid., p. 435. 23 La CGivilisation . . ., p. 15. 24 Metchnikoff, 'Revolution and Evolution', p. 433.</page><page sequence="9">DESPOTISM AND ANARCHY 403 of the parties involved. Sociological progress, therefore, implies the lessening of compulsion and the increase of freedom.25 It is not, of course, natural selection or the struggle for existence which is the driving force behind the evolution of society, since Mechnikov reserved that law for the biological sphere only. There appears to be no motive force impelling the development of the lower types of co-operation towards the higher, or at least none so far dis- covered by physics, chemistry or biology. Sociology, as far as Mechnikov is concerned, is an area in which what is normally thought of as causality does not operate. When entities combine to form a sociological unit, they do so, as it were, in the interests of progress as such. Mechnikov in fact found it convenient to describe this process in teleological terms: . . . since in our days teleological or anthropomorphic language is no trap for anyone I may be permitted to use these terms to express my meaning more exactly. Because nature requires solidarity in beings, without which she would be unable to bring about the higher forms of the future, she first of all habituates them to communal life by coercion, she then softens them by differentiation and finally, when she has judged them ripe for voluntary collaboration in their work, she lets go the reins of constraint and subordination and leaves reproduction, the most important task from a biological point of view to their most private and arbitrary instincts and inclinations.26 Taken in the context of the totality of Mechnikov's system, it is doubtful if his teleological or anthropomorphic terminology can be regarded simply as a stylistic device: teleology is rather the ines- capable implication of his sociological method. His reluctance to make this clear is understandable in view of the long-standing tradi- tion that teleology has no place in scientific method and explanation. Positivism, which has long dominated scientific thinking, would tend to view as truly 'scientific' only a discipline from which metaphysical notions such as teleology have been fully exorcized. In striving for scientific status, sociology, itself a product of Positivism, naturally accepted this assumption. Mechnikov's sociological method therefore ran counter to the received opinion of most of his contemporaries and was unlikely to gain him many sympathizers. Yet, if one ascribes rational and purposeful action only to the human species, the selection of conceptual tools remaining to explain the phenomena of nature and society is meagre indeed. One is left to consider development in these spheres in terms of probability and natural selection, probability to supply the raw clay of evolution and natural selection to fashion it. This overlooks the fact that purposeful 26 La Civilisation .. .., pp. 26-7. 26 ibid., pp. 27-8.</page><page sequence="10">404 JAMES D. WHITE or conscious action must itself be the product of evolution, that 'teleological' or organizing behaviour is to be found on the lower reaches of the evolutionary scale, albeit in a rudimentary form. Mechnikov makes this entirely plausible assumption in return for the insights he provides into the evolution of society. In the earlier part of his book Mechnikov discussed sociological progress as it appears in nature: the main content of the work, how- ever, is devoted to progress with regard to human society. Here Mechnikov noticed three ascending stages of social co-operation analogous to those encountered in nature. In human society, it seems to him, social development enters a new upward spiral, and, typically, Mechnikov describes three types of social formations. At the lowest level are the coercive social organizations, the despotisms of the East. The second type is what Mechnikov calls 'subordinate groupings', in which society is divided into interdependent groups brought about by the division of labour. The third and final type of social organization is the 'co-ordinated grouping' characterized by free association and the absence of social controls-in short-anarchy.27 These forms of social organization form the basis of Mechnikov's view of human history, the progress of humanity as a whole from the lower forms of social organization to the higher, is a process which had yet to be completed. In answer to the objection that not all peoples had traversed the path of progress which he had touched upon in his article 'Revolution and Evolution' Mechnikov offered as a solution his theory of hydraulic societies. As a preliminary, however, he dismissed the idea put forward by several previous writers, such as Letourneau, that progress and civilization had been made possible by the innate abilities of the higher 'racial' types, the fact that some people remained at a low level of civilization being taken as a mark of their racial inferiority. It was simply a matter of pointing out that while some of the 'higher' races, according to Letourneau's classification, such as the Egyptians, did found civilizations, others, like the Bedouin, their near relations, had remained exactly as they were from time immemorial. What produced civilizations, Mechnikov argued, was not the race to which peoples belonged, but the conditions in which they found them- selves.28 Mechnikov considered that the first step by which a given people may raise itself on the way to advancement in civilization is to subor- dinate itself to a despotism. For, he remarks, although there are free peoples in considerable number in various parts of the world, they are without exception no further advanced than the Stone Age as 27 ibid., P. 35. 28 ibid., p 79ff.</page><page sequence="11">DESPOTISM AND ANARCHY 405 regards science, art and industry, whereas all the advanced nations have at some time experienced despotism.29 In order to advance materially and culturally a people must com- bine its efforts and submit to stern discipline. The despot himself, however, is a mere symbol: it is not he who oppresses his subjects, but their own impotence to transform their surroundings individually without the combined effort and the discipline which this involves. In Mechnikov's opinion, it was typical that all the four great civilizations of the ancient world, the Egyptian, the Assyrio-Baby- lonian, the Hindu and the Chinese, were despotic. All of them, more- over, were associated with great river systems, the utilization of which for irrigation purposes made their high level of culture possible. Mechnikov, however, cautions that he is not propounding any variety of determinism or 'geographical fatalism'. He stresses that: it is not in the environment itself, but in the relationship between the environment and the aptitude of its inhabitants to provide voluntarily the element of co-operation and solidarity imposed on each by nature that one must look for the raison d'eAtre of a people's primitive institutions and for their further transformations.30 It would, of course, be quite inconsistent with Mechnikov's method- ology for him to speak in terms of fatalism or determinism when deal- ing with a sociological question, since that type of causality could only be properly applied to the inorganic world. It must be remarked that Mechnikov's sociological method is singularly apt in explaining the formation of hydraulic societies, for, as he indicated, it is not the presence of the river, but the phenomenon of co-operation which creates the civilization; the special problems in utilizing the river create the need for that co-ordination. There is, however, no causal chain which guarantees that that need will be met, nor is it conceivable that the whole population should con- sciously decide to submit to despotic rule or that one far-sighted genius among them should by dint of wiles, ruses and intimidation subdue the multitudes to his tyrannical power. It is, on the other hand, more reasonable to suppose that, just as groups of living cells combine together to form a more complex organism, so groups of men sacrifice their individual interests in collaborating together for the common good. In neither case need individual consciousness play any significant part. It is then the role of a stimulus towards collective organization that Mechnikov assigns to the great historical rivers. He writes: The historical rivers, the great educators of humanity, are not dis- tinguished from the others by the volume of their waters: the Nile has 29 ibid., pp. 36-7. 30 ibid., p. 41.</page><page sequence="12">406 JAMES D. WHITE three times less than the Danube. But all of them without exception are possessed of one remarkable characteristic which reveals the secret of their glamorous destinies: they all transform the land which they water sometimes into a granary of abundance where millions of men may gather in a few days their sustenance for a year and at other times into infectious swamps strewn with the corpses of countless victims of floods, famine or disease. The specific environment which these rivers form cannot be exploited other than by the severely disciplined collaboration of teams of men recruited from the generally heterogeneous populations from up and down the river, different in language, race, customs and appearance. The canals of the Kiang-nan and the dykes of the Huang-ho probably represent a carefully contrived collective work of more numerous generations than the pyramids and temples of Egypt. The least negligence in the digging of a ditch, the maintenance of an em- bankment, simple laziness, the selfishness of one man or a group of men in these exceptional surroundings can be the cause of a public calamity, of an irreparable general disaster. Thus, under pain of death, the beneficent river imposes a close and continuous solidarity on the multi- tudes who may ignore or hate each other. It condemns each one to labours whose common utility is not perceived until later, and of whose plan of action, at least initially, neither all or even half of the individuals involved can be aware. Here, then, is the real source of the fearful and respectfiul worship of peoples for the River, this god which feeds and rules them, which destroys them and gives them life, which deigns to vouchsafe its secrets to the chosen few, but which a simple mortal must serve without understanding its imperative commands. 31 If one compares Wittfogel's treatment of the same subject one finds that Mechnikov anticipated to a remarkable extent the basic ideas underlying more recent interpretations of Oriental society. It may be noted, however, that Wittfogel neglects to provide a 'sociological' treatment of the subject in Mechnikov's sense of the term: These patterns come into being when an experimenting community of farmers or protofarmers finds large sources of moisture in a dry but potentially fertile area. If irrigation farming depends on the effective handling of a major supply of water, the distinctive quality of water- its tendency to gather in bulk-becomes institutionally decisive. A large quantity of water can be channelled and kept within bounds only by the use of mass labour; and this mass labour must be coordinated, disciplined, and led. Thus a number of farmers eager to conquer arid lowlands and plains are forced to invoke the organizational devices which, on the basis of premachine technology offer the one chance of success: they must work in co-operation with their fellows and subordi- nate themselves to a directing authority.32 Although the discussion of Oriental despotism and a description of 31 ibid., pp. I88-. 32 Wittfogel, op. cit., p. i8.</page><page sequence="13">DESPOTISM AND ANARCHY 407 the four great river civilizations occupies most of Mechnikov's book, this, it must be recalled, is, according to his general scheme of world history, only the first and most elementary form of social organiza- tion. The era of the hydraulic societies is followed by what Mechnikov terms the Mediterranean period during which the chief centres of civilization were the Mediterranean oligarchies of Carthage, Greece and Rome. He considered that the European Middle Ages can best be classified as a subdivision of this period, since, in his opinion, the organization of society whether based on slavery or serfdom was basically the same. Mechnikov regarded the distinction between slaves and serfs to be merely verbal, for the principle upon which these societies are based is differentiation and division of labour. It is true that in these societies subordination of individuals and groups was not so severe as in the ancient despotisms, but association and collaboration were still achieved by the application of constraint.33 The modern or Oceanic period begins with the European voyages of discovery. The period has two subdivisions, the Atlantic era which saw the exploration and colonization of America and Australia, and the opening up of Japan and China to European influence. The second division, the Universal era which began with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, was destined, Mechnikov thought, to realize the essence of society, to abolish all compulsion and institute mutual association based on a truly voluntary principle. Anarchy would then prevail.34 Mechnikov's synthesis of world history is interesting because of its uniqueness, though outwardly it bears some resemblance to those of Hegel and Marx. Like Hegel, and Marx to a lesser extent, Mechnikov saw history as the gradual unfolding and development of freedom. Yet, although Mechnikov might have found this aspect of the Hegelian scheme congenial, he was clearly as irritated by Hegel's metaphysical method as he was by Proudhon's. He shared too much the deep respect of the Positivists for science to be impressed by Hegelian dialectics. One may surmise, however, that in some part at least Mechnikov's sociological method was expressly designed to put the Hegelian philosophy of history on a more scientific footing. Indeed, in i866 he wrote: I know that at the present time dialectical criticism has stopped short at the theory of society; in the physiological and chemical laboratories there are being formulated and in part have already been formulated perhaps newer and more perfect methods for studying social questions than any type of dialectics.35 33 La Civilisation . . ., p. 44ff. 34 ibid., p- 159- 35 Mechnikov, 'Prudonova "teoriya" . . .', op. cit., p. I792.</page><page sequence="14">408 JAMES D. WHITE These methods are presumably the same which Mechnikov used in his writings on sociology. Mechnikov paid scant attention to Marx. The two references to him in 'Revolution and Evolution' suggest that Mechnikov regarded him as belonging with Adam Smith and David Ricardo to the 'economic empiricist' school. This approach Mechnikov considered 'inadequate to satisfy the modern demand for positive knowledge of the natural laws pervading the evolution of human societies.'36 As far as Mechnikov was concerned, to speak of the evolution of societies in terms of the evolution of economic systems was as great an error, if not greater, than to treat society in terms of the 'struggle for exis- tence' of the Darwinians. While it is indisputable that economic systems conform to certain inherent laws, and though these laws may well affect social development, society as such must, on the other hand, possess natural laws peculiar to itself, and it is the task of the sociologist to find them. He who takes economic laws to be those of society is deluding himself. There is, however, a sense in which the systems of Marx and Mechnikov complement each other. About the great periods of history, which Mechnikov designated as Mediterranean and Atlantic, he said little more than that they were characterized by the type of relations based on interdependence through differentiation of func- tions or the division of labour. These were, for Marx, broadly speak- ing, the era of class society. This was the historical span, and the phenomenon of differentiation or class divisions to which Marx paid most attention in his works, giving concreteness and substance to what Mechnikov had left vague and abstract. Yet, if Marx gave a better understanding of the middle reaches of world history from the point of view of radical politics, Mechnikov certainly gave a more convincing explanation of its beginning and end. If, as Marx stated, 'in the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will',37 Mechnikov was able to provide the insight afforded by his sociological method into why and how this should be possible -why it was that men should be able to react rationally to a situa- tion independently of their consciousness. The importance of Mechni- kov's conception of spontaneous social organization reappears with even greater force at the end of history, since this factor ensures that a co-ordinated society is not only possible but inevitable once political coercion and control have been removed. Marx was unable to furnish such a guarantee: he could demonstrate that capitalism would 36 Metchnikoff, 'Revolution and Evolution', P. 412. 37 Karl Marx, 'Preface to a Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy', in Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Selected Works, I, Moscow, I969, P. 503.</page><page sequence="15">DESPOTISM AND ANARCHY 409 collapse and that a new social order would emerge; he could show that human nature was adaptable and changeable, but not that it was basically socialist. Marx's view of society as an organism deter- mined by relations of production broke down at this crucial point. While it could be shown that the economics of slavery, feudalism and capitalism divided society into classes, he was unable to suggest a model for the future socialist economics whose structure would ensure a classless society. The refusal of Mechnikov to deal with economic topics is the most serious weakness in his approach to history and the society of the future, though in fact his whole approach demands a discussion of the role played by economic systems in social development. If, as Mechnikov argued, human society must reach a high level of civiliza- tion to mature so that nature may let slip the reins of constraint and allow it to function on the basis of voluntary co-operation, this can mean that anarchy can only be attained if society has reached a certain level of material progress. This must be Mechnikov's mean- ing, since he makes clear that by 'civilization' he refers to industry, science and art.38 Sociology then, in Mechnikov's sense, must in some way be related to material progress, in particular to economic development. What this relation is, Mechnikov did not make clear, nor did he pose the question of what precisely the level of civilization must be before a state of anarchy became possible. Many of these lacunae can be attributed to the fact the Mechnikov's book is more an outline of his system than the full exposition, which no doubt would have come to fruition had he lived to complete its elaboration. It was probably because of this lack of elaboration that Mechni- kov's work aroused no interest in Western Europe, even within the anarchist movement. His work, however, received greater attention in his native Russia, which was altogether fitting, since he had never severed his ties with the Russian revolutionary movement and most of his political works appeared in Russian emigre journals. In I889 La Civilisation et les grands fleuves historiques39 appeared in Russian translation, incomplete, however, because of the censorship: the full translation did not appear in Moscow until 1924.40 Even in Russia Mechnikov's work did not gain great popularity. In spite of the fact that it appeared at a time when many Russian scholars were con- cerning themselves with questions of social and historical develop- ment, there were too many other schools of thought to which they might turn for Mechnikov to gain any substantial following.

WHITE comparison with Marx, Comte, Spencer, Buckle and Mill, Mechni- kov had little to offer, since the Russians' interest in historical and social theory was essentially a practical one concerning the future development of their own country, and in particular whether or not it must necessarily pass through the capitalist stage. On this point, of course, Mechnikov had nothing to contribute. One of Mechnikov's advocates was Plekhanov, the prominent Russian Marxist, on whom Mechnikov exercised possibly some in- fluence. In I889 Plekhanov wrote an obituary of Mechnikov and a favourable though not uncritical review of his book which, in his opinion, 'touches upon the most basic questions of the philosophy of history and for some of them provides a completely satisfactory answer.'4i That this was not simply courtesy to a writer recently deceased can be seen from the fact that in his most celebrated work, On the Question of the Development of the Monist View of History published in I 895 Mechnikov's work was cited to support Plekhanov's materia- list view of history.42 He was also mentioned in two other works by Plekhanov of the same period.43 It is certainly significant that Plekhanov, the Marxist who was most impressed by Mechnikov, should also be the writer who put forward the theory of the Russian state as an Oriental despotism, as he did in his introduction to The History of Russian Social Thought.44 It is equally remarkable that the argumentation for this idea followed that of neither Hegel nor Marx, but that of Mechnikov. The despotism which Plekhanov describes is not Hegel's dawn of civilization nor is it Marx's 'Asiatic mode of production': it is the necessity for co-operation and co-ordination leading to the establish- ment of a strong centralized authority. The stimulus towards co- operation in this case was not the need to harness a great river, but to protect Russia against the nomadic tribes of the East: the centralized authority this gave rise to was, of course, the Russian autocracy. Plekhanov, it is true, did not acknowledge any debt for this conception to Mechnikov, yet the similarity remains. As far as Mechnikov's sociological methodology was concerned, Plekhanov dismissed this as 'undeniable deviation towards ideal- ism' 45 and most Russian Marxists were no doubt inclined to agree with him. Mechnikov's ideas on sociology, however, were much better received in a rather unexpected quarter, namely by the Russian 41 G. V. Plekhanov, 'O knige L. I.

In contrast to the Social Democrats and the Narodniks, whose main concern was Russia's future economic development, the liberals were more preoccupied with political possibilities, in particular with the question of whether or not representative institutions could succeed in Russia. The official dogma on this subject was that Russian society, being fundamentally different from that of Western Europe, was most naturally suited to an autocratic political regime. In disputing this quasi-Slavophile doctrine of the existing regime, liberal scholars took upon themselves the task of investigating on a comparative basis the dynamics of social development in Russia and the West. Both Paul Vinogradoff and Maxim Kovalevsky, who be- came the outstanding scholars in this field, followed Mechnikov in arguing that in all societies political power and privilege develop from a pristine state of free association and self-government, but that they in turn would give way to democratic institutions as the forces of free association reasserted themselves. Autocracy or any other form of political coercion, they concluded, was neither innate nor permanent in any society. In Russia, as in the West, the natural tendency of society was towards self-government. This interesting trend within Russian social thought as repre- sented by Mechnikov, Kropotkin, Kovalevsky and Vinogradoff and characterized by its concern with co-operation, mutual aid or self- government would certainly be more widely known if it had suc- ceeded politically. When, however, the Russian autocracy fell it was not replaced by the kind of democratic institutions that any of these thinkers had in mind. The forces in Russian society of co-operation and mutual aid created, not copies of the British parliament or organs of local self-government, but the Soviets, which were claimed by a quite different current within Russian social thought.</page></plain_text>
