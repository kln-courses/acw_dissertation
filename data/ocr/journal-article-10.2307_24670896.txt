Giulea University university of uayton, 3uu college ram, uayton, υ η 41 ,ע40כΛν1 Dragos.Dragos. Giulea@notes. udayton. edu Abstract The noetic turn—perhaps the most important development in Jewish theologi cal discourse after that from prophetic literature to apocalypticism—denotes the translation of the biblical and particularly apocalyptic ontological and epistemo logical categories, generally conceived according to the norms and categories of everyday knowledge, into noetic categories. God, his throne, light, angels and heavens are re-conceived from a noetic perspective. Noetic perception takes the place of direct vision, hearing and dreams in apprehending the heavenly mysteries of the apocalyptic literature. The noetic turn introduces new ontological layers and degrees in heaven, new doctrines regarding the levels of divine concealment and manifestation and new theories about human epistemic capacities. This turn exerts a momentous influence on philosophically educated authors of Jewish and Christian cultures, on such classics as Philo, Clement, Origen, Halevi, Maimonides and Gersonides and many other thinkers of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Keywords Judaism, noetic turn, apocalypse, vision, merkavah, intellect 1. Introduction One of Philo of Alexandria's accounts of a visio Dei begins with the follow ing description of the ascent of the intellect to heaven: Next, it [i.e., the mind, νοΰς] is lifted on high (πτηνός αρθείς) and, after exploring the air and the phenomena that occur in it, it is borne further upwards (ανωτέρω φέρεται) towards the ether and the revolutions of heaven. Then, after being carried around in the dances of the planets and fixed stars in accordance with the laws of perfect music, and following the guidance of its DOI:DOI: 10.1163/157006310X529218 © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011</page><page sequence="2">24 D.

(Philo, Opif. 70)' The text continues by describing the noetic entities contemplated in the intelligible world, namely the noetic paradigms of the sensible things (αισθητών έν εκείνη τά παραδείγματα και τάς ιδέας θεασάμενος) and, at the end of the entire spiritual journey, the encounter with the Great King himself (αυτόν τον μέγαν βασιλέα), God {Opif. 71). The account reflects the main lines of an ascension similar to those of the apocalyptic literature where the visionary journeys in the heights beyond the confines of the vis ible world. It is there that the apocalyptic seer contemplates the heavenly king on his throne and enjoys the vision of the divine glory and of the countless hosts of angelic beings glorifying and serving God.2 According to one of Martha Himmelfarbs observations, the category of ascension involves an emblematic turn from prophetic to apocalyptic nar rative. Unlike the prophets, who receive the divine vision within a terres trial environment, apocalyptic seers ascend to the heavenly temple: "Ezekiel is the only one of all the classical prophets to record the experience of being physically transported by the spirit of God, but even Ezekiel does not ascend to heaven."3 Modern scholars have also investigated the ontologies and epistemologies present in the apocalyptic literature and emphasized the heavenly temple as a central category of this literature.4 !) For De opificio mundi I will make use of David T. Runia's translation from Philo of Alex andria:andria: On the Creation of the Cosmos according to Moses (Leiden: Brill, 2001), 64.

For the other Philonian writings, I will follow the English translation from Philo: With an English Transla tiontion (ed. F. H. Colson and G. H. Whitaker; 10 vols, and 2 suppl. vols.; Loeb Classical Library; Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1949-1956). Colson s and Whitaker s Greek text is also based on Cohn and Wendland.

The Alexandrian operates with a more refined language which allows him to make more precise ontological and epistemological descriptions. To put it briefly, employing a Greek philosophical language, Philo is able to qualify the heavenly realities of the biblical and apocalyptic theology through noetic terminology, then to distinguish the noetic nature of those entities which alypticalyptic in Judaism and Early Christianity (London: SPCK, 1982); Martha Himmeifarb, Tours Tours Tours of Hell: An Apocalyptic Form in Jewish and Christian Literature (Philadelphia: Univer sitysity of Pennsylvania Press, 1983); Jon D.

Giulea / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 inhabit heaven and those noetic capacities a human being needs in order to access that particular realm. While Himmelfarb points out the passage from prophetic to apocalyp tic discourse, I would like to propose a theory which may be the next important turn in Jewish religious thought, a theory regarding a concep tual and linguistic phenomenon which 1 call the "noetic turn." Arguably one of the most important paradigm shifts of late antiquity, if not the most important in terms of theological vocabulary and conceptual instru ments, the noetic turn denotes the translation of the ontological and epis temological categories of the apocalyptic discourse into noetic categories.5 The noetic turn should also be explained against the Platonic distinction between the noetic (intellectual, invisible) and the aesthetic (sensible, sense-perceptible, visible).6 For Plato, intellectual perception already repre sen ted a particular epistemic capacity associated exclusively with the noetic or invisible realities.7 Noesis, therefore, should not be understood as a mere 51 It may be argued that the turn is actually from both the biblical and apocalyptic ontology and epistemology to the noetic perspective. However, keeping in mind Himmelsfarb's dis tinction between prophetic and apocalyptic ontologies and the fact that Philo also places the divine temple in heavens and invests ascension as the main method of accessing the divine, it seems, consequently, more accurate to affirm that the noetic turn represents a transformation of the apocalyptic mindset and vocabulary (in both biblical and extra biblical texts). fi) While Aristotle is generally correct when he affirms that the pre-socratics did not make the distinction between noes 15 and aisthesis (see De an. III. 427a; Metaph. 1009b)—because they had not yet connected the noesis with an object of thought more subtle than matter— it is also true that Heraclitus and particularly Parmenides expressed serious reserves regard ing sense-perception and proposed nous or noesis as a higher epistemic capacity, more appropriate in the search of the truth; cf. Francis F. Peters, "Noesis (Intuition)," "Νοέιόη (Object of the intellect)," "Nous (Intellect, Mind)," in his Greek Philosophical Terms: A His toricaltorical Lexicon (New York: NYU Press, 1970), 121-39. It is Plato, however, who associates epistemeepisteme (the true knowledge) with noesis and noetic and invisible ideas, in opposition with doxadoxa (the opinion), aisthesis (sense-perception) and sensible things; e.g., Phaed. 79d; Rep. 478a-480a; 508a-51 Id; Tim. 27. The distinction will remain essential for middle Platon ists, Hellenizing Jewish and Christian thinkers such as Philo, Clement or Origen, and later Neo-Platonists. Aristotle, in spite of placing the Platonic forms within things, still con ceives of the nous as the faculty of true knowledge (episteme) which holds intelligible things {ta[ta noetd) and forms (ta eide) as the objects of investigation. In contradistinction, as he shows in Dean. 431bl7-432al4, sense-perception (aisthesis) remains the faculty proper to sensible things (ta aistheta). 71 See, for instance, Plato, Rep. 476a-480a; 508a-511d. E.g. Rep. 508b-c (trans. C. D. C. Reeve; Indianapolis: Hackett, 2004), 204: "What the latter [i.e., the good] is in the intel ligible realm (έν τω νοητω τόκω) in relation to understanding (πρός τε νοΰν) and intelligi</page><page sequence="5">D. A. Giulea / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 27 process within the mind. Such an understanding would be entirely a reboursrebours to the manner in which the Greek philosophers, and later the Hel lenistic thinkers from Philo to many Christian authors, conceived of this capacity. Not only a pure event of the mind, noesis was, especially in reli gious discourses, the particular epistemic capacity able to perceive such divine and impalpable realities as God, angels, souls, or the heavenly glory. Those realities apprehended through noesis were, therefore, noetic, extrin sic to, and independent from, the human mind. In what concerns the ontological aspect of the noetic turn, the iden tification of God with the Nous represents a definite paradigm already encountered in Xenophanes (for instance, frg. A 1), Pythagoras (frg. Β 15), Anaxagoras (frg. A 48), Archelaos (frg. A 12), or Democritus (frg. A 74).8 In Philebus, Plato ascribes to the cause (τό αίτιον) which brings everything into being such a diversity of titles as productive agent (τό ποιούν; 26e7), demiurgic agent (τό δημιουργούν; 27b 1) and Nous (28d8). The Nous gov erns the universe (30c, 30d8) and actually represents Zeus' intellect (30d).9 Aristotle will further define God in noetic terms, since the first mover (πρώτον κινοΰν) will be characterized as a god and divine intellect, and its main activity (ενέργεια) as νόησις (Metaph. 1072b).10 God will, moreover, ble things (τά νοούμενα), the former [i.e., the sun] is in the visible realm (έν τω όρατώ) in relation to sight (πρός τε όψιν) and visible things (τά δρώμενα)." For the Greek text, see S. R. Slings, Platonis Rcmpvblicam (Oxford: Clarendon, 2003), 253. A similar idea occurs in Rep. 534a (Reeve, 229; Slings, 286): "Belief (δόξαν) is concerned with becoming (γένεσιν); understanding (νοήσιν [i.e., intuition, the activity of the νοΰς]) with being (ούσίαν). And as being is to becoming, so understanding is to belief; and as understanding is to belief, so knowledge (έπιστήμην) is to belief and thought to imagination (διάνοιαν πρός είκασίαν)." " See Hermann Diels and Walther Kranz, eds., Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (3 vols.; Zurich: Weidmann, 1964), 1:113 for Xenophanes, 1:454 for Pythagoras, 2:19 for Anax agoras, 2:47 for Archelaos, 2:102 for Democritus. 91 For the Greek text, see Platonis Opera (ed. I. Burnet; 5 vols.; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1964). Timaeus reflects a similar perspective, since in this dialogue the maker (ό ποιων; 31b2) of the universe also receives the titles of god (30a2; d3), Father (37c7) and again Nous (47e4). 101 See Werner Jaeger, Aristotelis Metaphysial (3d ed; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1963), 253. In Eth. Nic. 1178b21-22, Aristotle defines God's activity (ένέργεια) essentially as contemplative (θεωρητική) and, consequently, the highest human activity should also have the same nature; see Aristotelis Ethica Nicomachea (ed. I. Bywater; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1962), 216.</page><page sequence="6">28 D. A. Giulea / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 be be defined as νόησις νοήσεως (Metaph. 1074b; Eth. nic. 10.1177b-l 178b)." The middle Platonists and Philo will continue to develop this noetic lan guage in connection with divine realities and divine knowledge.12 This lan guage can also be encountered in other religious materials of late antiquity, such as the Hermetic Corpus and the Chaldean Oracles. With Philo, the Platonic distinction between the noetic and the aes thetic makes its way into Jewish thought. He translates the ancient biblical and apocalyptic languages through these new categories. With this turn, the religious ontology of ancient Judaism—a God dwelling in heaven on a glorious throne surrounded by glory and myriads of angels, etc.—is trans ferred to the noetic realm. Once accepted in the theological discourse, the ontological distinction between the noetic and aesthetic worlds involves the epistemological distinction between the noetic and aesthetic percep tions, between noesis and aisthesis. 2.2. The Noetic Turn beyond the Open Heaven and the Eye of the Spirit 2.2.1. The Image of the Open Heaven in Scripture and Apocalyptic Materials As Mircea Eliade and other specialists in the semantics of religious symbol isms explain, religion is always interested in reaching the core of existence, the place where God lives, the center of everything or the center as such. Seen from this perspective, religion becomes a search for the center of existence—a sacred itinerary, a pilgrimage (whether metaphorically or simply literally understood).13 As mentioned above, Himmelfarb shows n) It is not aleatory, then, that the highest science or knowledge (επιστήμη) which humans should search is the science of the divine, e.g., Metapb. A.983a5-7: ή γαρ θειοτάτη και τιμιωτάτη; τοιαύτη δέ διχώς αν εϊη μόνη; ήν τε γαρ μάλιστ' αν ό θεός έ'χοι, θεία των επιστημών εστί, καν εϊ τις των θείων εϊη. Cf. Aristotle, Eth. eud. 1249b20: τον θεόν θεραπεύειν και θεωρεΐν in Aristotelis Ethica Eudemia (ed. R. R. Walzer and J. M. Mingway; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 125. ״&gt; Cf.

Giulea / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 29 that the prophetic method of accessing the divine—the visio Dei taking place on earth—changes to the method of ascension in apocalyptic litera ture. Confirming Eliade's logic, Christopher Rowland indicates that the change of the divine indwelling from the earthly sanctuary to heaven entails the change of the method of accessing God's glory from terrestrial vision to ascension and visio Dei in the celestial realm.14 As As Rowland also observes, the ancient biblical expression "open heaven" was frequently employed as an emblematic indicator of divine theophanies in apocalypticism or the New Testament.'5 The following examples will illustrate this thesis: Bring the whole tithe into the treasury; let there be food in my house. Put me to the proof, says the Lord of Hosts, and see if 1 do not open windows in the sky and pour a blessing on you as long as there is need. (Mai 3:10)'6 Then he gave orders to the skies above and threw open heavens doors; he rained down manna for them to eat and gave them the grain of heaven. (Ps 78:23-24) On the fifth day of the fourth month in the thirtieth year, while I was among the exiles by the river Kebar, the heavens were opened and I saw visions from God. (Ezek 1:1) Take courage, then; for formerly you were worn out by evils and tribula tions, but now you will shine like the luminaries of heaven; you will shine and appear, and the portals of heaven will be opened for you. (1 En. 104:2)17 And I created for him [i.e., Adam] an open heaven, so that he might look upon the angels singing the triumphal song. (2 En. [J] 31:2 [OTP 1:152-54])'* 141 Rowland, The Open Heaven, 80. After making the observation that the usual apocalyptic cosmology presupposes the throne of glory placed in heaven, Rowland affirms: "The cos mological beliefs were such that it often became necessary for anyone who would enter the immediate presence of God to embark on a journey through the heavenly world, in order to reach God himself." 151 Ibid., 78: "One of the most distinctive features of the apocalyptic literature is the con viction that the seer could pierce the vault of heaven and look upon the glorious world of God and his angels. Frequently this is expressed by the conventional expression the heavens opened (T Levi 2:6 Greek; Acts 7:56) or the belief that a door opened in heaven (/ Enoch 14:15; Rev 4:1) to enable the seer to look and indeed at times to enter the realm above to gaze on its secrets." 161 Unless otherwise mentioned, I will make use in this article of the Oxford Study Bible: The The Revised English Bible with the Apocrypha. 171 Cf.

Ab. 7:3 [OTP 1:885]) And afterward it happened that, behold, the heaven was opened, and 1 saw, and strength was given to me, and a voice was heard from on high. (2 Bar. 22:1 [OTP 1:629]) She said to him [i.e., Eve to Seth], "Look up with your eyes and see the seven heavens opened, and see with your eyes how the body of your father lies on its face, and all the holy angels are with him, praying for him and saying, 'Forgive him, Ο Father of all, for he is your image.'" (Apoc. Mos. 35:2 [OTP 2:289]) And behold there came suddenly a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love and in whom I have pleasure, and my commandments.. And there came a great and exceeding white cloud over our heads and bore away our Lord and Moses and Elias.

(Mark 1:10)2U Then he added, "In very truth I tell you all: you will see heaven wide open and God's angels ascending and descending upon the Son of Man." (John 1:51) "Look!" he said. "I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God." (Acts 7:56) He [i.e., Peter] saw heaven opened, and something coming down that looked like a great sheet of sailcloth.

"During a general baptism of the people, when Jesus too had been baptized and was praying, heaven opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove" (Luke 3:21 22־); "No sooner had Jesus been baptized and come up out of the water than the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove to alight on him" (Matt 3:16).</page><page sequence="9">D.

(Rev 4:1) I saw heaven wide opened, and a white horse appeared; its rider's name was Faithful and True, for he is just in judgment and just in war. (Rev 19:11) Employing the Platonic distinction between the noetic and the aesthetic, I would regard the expression the "open heaven" as aesthetic or literal, in order to distinguish it from the noetic discourse. In this aesthetic way, the expression the "open heaven" presupposes a firmament similar to that of the Genesis narrative (Gen 1), as a curtain separating heaven and earth, and also presupposing the possibility for this firmament to be open as a curtain.21 Unlike the aesthetic perspective present in the Bible and apoca lyptic writings, Philo advances the Platonic distinction between the sense perceptible and the noetic. This distinction does not presuppose a heavenly firmament to be open and crossed, but requires the acquisition of a special epistemic capacity, the noetic perception, the only one able to undertake the passage from the sensible to the noetic realm. 2.2.2.2. The Eye of the Spirit: An Intermediary Stage between Biblical Epistemology and and Philo's Noetic Perception? While the author of 1 Enoch already talks about the opening of the eyes as an epistemic condition for the vision of God (for instance, 1 En. 1:2 and 89-91, an expression which also occurs in Ascen. Isa. 6:6), certain other texts make use of a phrase which changes the whole instrument of percep don from ordinary sight to something more spiritual: the "eye of spirit." This phrase appears for example in: "And I saw the Great Glory while the eyes of my spirit were open, but I could not thereafter see, nor the angel who (was) with me, nor any of the angels whom I had seen worship my Lord" (Ascen. Isa. 9:37 [OTP 2:172]).12 211 Heavens are also open to allow the rain to descend from the heavenly stores, as for example, Gen 7:11, Deut 28:12, and 2 Bar. 10:11 show. In I En. 33-36, the stars, winds, dew, rain and cold come forth through the gates of heaven. Likewise, 1 En. 72-76 informs us about the gates of the stars, sun, moon, winds, cold, draught, frost, locusts and desola tion.tion. Cf. 2 En. 6:1; 13:3; 14:2. 221221 For the critical text, see Paolo Bettiolo et al., eds., Ascensio Isaiae: Textus (CC; Series apocryphorum7;Turnhout: Brepols, 1995). Ascen. Isa. 6:6 and 9:37 come from the section of the text called "the Vision," which was probably produced in the second century C.E., according to Knibb (OTP 2:150). The expression is further remarkable since Philo himself</page><page sequence="10">32 D. Λ. Giulea /Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 The dream represents another visionary epistemic capacity distinct from sensible sight, a way of perceiving the heavenly realities. It is already pres ent in such theophanies as those of Gen 20:6-7, 1 Kgs 3:4-15, 1 Sam 3 and 1 En. 13:8: "And look, dreams came upon me, and visions fell upon me. And I saw visions of wrath, and there came a voice, saying, 'Speak to the sons of heaven to reprimand them."23 Chapters 83-90 of the first Eno chic corpus, also called Enoch's Dream Visions, relate a large variety of visionary experiences which the apocalyptic hero receives in the oneiric condition. In contradistinction to the traditional ways of envisioning the epistemic access to divine realities (the open heaven, direct vision, dream vision, vision through the eye of the spirit etc.), Philo will propose the noetic or intellectual perception, the noesis. 3. Philo and the Emergence of the Noetic Turn in Jewish Thought While Aristobulus reckoned that God is everywhere present in the uni verse and his power is manifested through all things (μόνος ό θεός έστι και δια πάντων ή δύναμις αϋτοΰ φανερά γίνεται), the concepts of noetic world and noetic perception do not appear in the extant fragments attributed to him.24 The noetic turn was simply not part of his mindset. When Aristo offers a definition of the nous as the "eye of the soul" (Opif. 53). The Enochic book of Dream Dream Visions (1 En 83-89) and its later additions (1 En 91:1-11,18,19; 92; 94-104) appears to constitute a corpus of second century B.C.E. materials (164-160 B.C.E.), according to Nickelsburg and VanderKam, 1 Enoch, 9. 231 1 En. 13:8 (Nickelsburg and VanderKam, 33).

Thus, he represents the paradigmatic Sinai theophany as a divine descent (κατάβασις θεία) and a fiery occurrence, gigantic and everywhere present (δια πάντων μεγαλειότητα), without combusting the burning bush, nor anything on earth.25 From an epistemological perspec tive, there is no indication that the spectators of this luminous theophany made use of other epistemic capacities than their ordinary sight. Aristobu lus informs us that not only Moses, but the whole Hebrew people contem plated this energy of God (πάντες θεωρήσωσι την ένέργειαν τοΰ θεοΰ),26 and he emphasizes that all were witnesses of the great theophany (τό τους συνορώντας έμφαντικώς έκαστα καταλαμβάνειν).27 It is, however, in Philo of Alexandria in the first century C.E. that we find for the first time a coherently developed noetic ontology and a noetic epistemology. Philo gives us the following definition of the intellect: "for what the intellect (νοΰς) is in the soul, this is what the eye is in the body; for each of them sees (βλέπει), in the one case the objects of thought (τά νοητά), in the other the objects of perception (τά αισθητά)."28 The intellect (also called reason, λόγος, in Det. 83 and Post. 53) is further described as a special gift (έξαίρετον γέρας) from God (Deus 45; cf. 47), a fragment of the Deity (Somn. 1.34), a ruler of the soul and a sort of god of the body (Opif. 69; Agr. 57). It is the image of the divine and invisible being (that is, God; Plant. 18) and the only faculty through which we can comprehend God (Ebr. 108). Its essence, however, remains unintelligible and unknown to us (Mut. 10). Operating with ontological and epistemo logical categories that come from Plato's Timaeus 27, Philo articulates a doctrine of the intellect as the power of the soul able to perceive, beyond the sensible universe, something of the noetic world. While deploring the impious doctrine of an unproductive God (a vast inactivity [πολλή the most likely date for the work of Aristobulus (OTP 2:833)." For an English translation, see A. Y.

This descent does not have a particular location because God is everywhere (ώστε την κατάβασιν μή τοπικην είναι, πάντη γαρ ό θεός έστιν;έστιν; ibid. 8.10.12-14 [GCS 43/1:453]). 26י Ibid. 8.10.12 (GCS 43/1:453). 271 Ibid. 8.10.17 (GCS 43/1:454). 281 Philo, Opif. 53. Philo also compares the nous with "the sight of the soul (ψυχής γαρ δψις), illuminated by rays peculiar to itself" (Deus 46).</page><page sequence="12">34 D. Λ.

So to what is invisible and intelligible (τω άοράτω και νοητω) he assigned eternity (άιδιότητα) as being akin and related to it, whereas on what is sense-perceptible he ascribed the appropriate name becoming. (Op if (Op if (Op if (Op if 12) The text shows, therefore, that, according to Philo and following Plato, there are two worlds (the noetic and the sensible) and two correspond ing epistemic capacities (the intellect [νους] and the sense-perception [αϊσθησις]): For God, because he is God, understood in advance that a beautiful copy (μίμημα) would not come into existence apart from a beautiful model (παραδείγματος), and that none of the objects of sense-perception (τι των αισθητών) would be without fault, unless it was modeled (άπεικονίσθη) on the archetypal (άρχέτυπον) and intelligible idea (νοητήν ίδέαν). Therefore, when he had decided to construct this visible cosmos (τον όρατόν κόσμον), he first marked out the intelligible cosmos (τον νοητόν), so that he could use it as a incorporeal and most god-like (άσωμάτω και θεοειδεστάτω) paradigm (παραδείγματι) and so produce the corporeal cosmos (τον σωματικόν), a younger likeness (άπεικόνισμα) of an older model, which would contain as many sense-perceptible kinds (αισθητά) as there were intelligible kinds (νοητά) in that other one... Then, taking up the imprints of each object in his own soul like in wax, he [i.e., the architect] carries around the intelligible city (νοητήν πόλιν) as an image in his head. Summoning up the representa tions by means of his innate power of memory and engraving their features (τους χαρακτήρας) even more distinctly (on his mind), he begins, as a good builder, to construct the city out of stones and timber, looking at the model (το παράδειγμα) and ensuring that the corporeal objects correspond to each of the incorporeal ideas (των ασωμάτων ιδεών). The conception we have concerning God must be similar to this, namely that when he had decided to found the great cosmic city, he first conceived its outlines (τύπους). Out of these he composed the intelligible cosmos (κόσμον νοητόν), which served</page><page sequence="13">D. A. Giulea / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 23-57 35 him as a model (παραδείγματι) when he completed the sense-perceptible cosmos (τον αΐσθητόν) as well. {Opif. 16-19)29 The noetic nature of the two agents of this double creation—God and his Logos—is also an intrinsic part of this theological scheme.30 While God the Father is the real Demiurge (ποιητής; Ο ρ if. 21), his Logos plays the role of the "instrument" by which God creates the world {Cher. 127; Abr. 6) and also of the noetic "place," in fact the very noetic cosmos where God draws the intelligible or eidetic project of creation; Just as the city that was marked out beforehand in the architect had no loca tion (χώραν) outside, but had been engraved in the soul of the craftsman, in the same way the cosmos composed of the ideas (ό έκ των ιδεών κόσμος) would have no other place (τόπον) than the divine Logos (τον θείον λόγον) who gives these (ideas) their ordered disposition. (Opif. 20) If you would wish to use a formulation that has been stripped down to essentials, you might say that the intelligible cosmos (νοητόν κόσμον) is noth ing else than the Logos of God as he is actually engaged in making the cosmos (θεοΰ λόγος ήδη κοσμοποιοΰντος). (Opif. 24) The double creation theory and the idea that the noetic paradigms are placed within the Logos recur in De opificio in a passage that calls the noetic world in addition, incorporeal; Now that the incorporeal cosmos (άσώματος κόσμος) had been completed and established in the divine Logos (έν τω θείω λόγω), the sense-perceptible cosmos (ό αισθητός) began to be formed as a perfect offspring, with the incorporeal serving as model (προς παράδειγμα τούτου). (Opif 36)" 291 The distinction is operative as well in other passages, for example Leg. 1.1: "For using symbolical language he [i.e., Moses] calls the mind (νοΰν) heaven, since heaven is the abode of natures discerned only by mind (αί νοητα'ι φύσεις), but sense-perception (αϊσθησιν)(αϊσθησιν) he calls earth, because sense-perception possesses a composition of a more earthly and body-like (σωματοειδή και γεωδεστέραν) sort." 3I&gt;) God himself is called the mind of the world (τοϋ των ολων νοϋ) in several places, e.g. Leg.Leg. 3.29; Abr. 4 and 192. Most likely, the idea appears for the first time in Thales, frg. A 23: νοΰν τοΰ κόσμου τον θεόν (Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, 1:78). 311 The term "incorporeal" is also used as synonymous with noetic in various other passages where Philo employs the term "invisible" as synonymous with noetic; e.g. Opif. 29: "First, therefore, the maker made an incorporeal (άσώματον) heaven and an invisible (άόρατον) earth and a form of air and of the void (άέρος ίδέαν και κενοΰ). To the former he assigned the name darkness, since the air is black by nature, to the latter the name abyss, because the</page><page sequence="14">36 D. A. Giulea / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 The passage is significant in its confirmation that the term "incorporeal" (άσώματος) refers not to entities deprived completely of real existence— pure abstractions—but rather clearly, and repeatedly, to a noetic sort of existence. This existence is more subtle than aesthetic realities, although not completely immaterial. According to the Alexandrian, the entire reality is actually constituted of various degrees of materiality and noetic levels. God is the mind of the universe and dwells in his Logos. The divine Logos itself, as an intelligible reality per se, is everywhere present in the visible universe through his two powers, which Philo calls either "goodness" and "authority" (Cher. 28), or "God" and "Lord" [Mos. 2.99). He also talks about a heavenly intelligible light, kindled before the sun and the source of light for all sensible lumi naries: sun, moon, stars, planets, etc. (Opif. 33). Unlike the luminaries, the heavenly light remains perceptible only through the intellect. Never theless, this light does not seem to be a simple eidetic paradigm of every possible luminary, a mere Platonic abstract Idea, since it is a real substance which procures the visible light of all the luminaries. Philo thus conceives of certain mediating elements between the intelli gible and sensible universes. These elements can trespass from one world into the other, especially from the immaterial into the material. In a cer tain way, they represent a revelation of the upper world. Morning and evening, for instance, although they cross the Limit or Boundary (Horos) of heaven and enter the sensible world, are described as incorporeal and noetic entities, since only the intellect can perceive them (Opif. 34). Like wise, intelligible air, which is the breath of God, and the aforementioned intelligible light, may change their subtle constitutions into heavier mate rialities and provide the air (that is, life) and light of the visible world: Both spirit (πνεΰμα) and light were considered deserving of a special privi lege. The former he named of God, because spirit is highly important for life (ζωτικώτατον) and God is the cause of life. Light he describes as exceedingly beautiful, for the intelligible (τό νοητόν) surpasses the visible (τοΰ όρατοΰ) in brilliance and brightness just as much, I believe, as sun surpasses darkness, day surpasses night, and intellect (νοΰς), which gives leadership to the entire soul, surpasses its sensible sources of information, the eyes of the body. That void is indeed full of depths and gaping. He then made the incorporeal being (άσώματον ούσίαν) of water and of spirit, and as seventh and last of all of light, which once again was incorporeal and was also the intelligible model (άσώματον ήν και νοητόν... παράδειγμα) of the sun and all the other light-bearing stars which were to be established in heaven."</page><page sequence="15">D. A. Giulea / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 23-57 37 invisible and intelligible light (τό δέ άόρατον και νοητόν φως) has come into being as image (είκών) of the divine Logos which communicated its genesis. It is a star that transcends the heavenly realm (ύπερουράνιος άστήρ), source of the visible stars (πηγη των αισθητών αστέρων), and you would not be off the mark to call it "allbrightness" (παναύγειαν). From it (άφ' ής) the sun and moon and other planets and fixed stars draw (άρύτονται) the illumination (φέγγη) that is fitting for them in accordance with the capacity they each have. But the unmixed and pure gleam has its brightness (αύγης) dimmed when it begins to undergo (τρέπεσθαι) a change from the intelligible to the sense-perceptible (κατά την έκ νοητοΰ προς αίσθητόν μεταβολήν), for none of the objects in the sense-perceptible realm is absolutely pure. (Opif. 30-31)32 A few epistemological remarks should be added to our discussion. As in certain biblical passages and the apocalyptic literature, Philo still maintains heaven as the preeminent geography of divine indwelling. The human being who intends to reach that realm has to ascend to those heights {Leg.{Leg. l.l).33 Nevertheless, in what concerns the access to that realm and the access to God, Philo advances a clearly innovative method: the noetic perception, the noesis. While still conceiving of ascension as the favored method of accessing God, Philo alters the nature of this ascension. Instead of transportation to heaven, direct vision, dream vision or other methods, he has the intellect perform the ascent. 2נ) Stars were also heavenly beings, according to Philo, who criticized Anaxagoras' theory that stars simply consist of fiery metal (Sown 1.22; Aet. 47). "They are living beings possess ing minds (Gig. 60; Plant. 12; Opif 73) and, more than that, divine souls (Gig. 8), divine natures (Opif. 144; Prov. 2.50; QG 4.188) and a host of visible gods (Act. 46). For further discussions, see Alan Scott, Origeti and the Life of the Stars: A History of an Idea (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 63-75. 351 Philo even affirms that the noetic natures are located in heaven, while the aesthetic ones are on earth. One of the conditions of possibility for the ascension to heaven is given by the Philonian assumption that the universe is arrayed as a ladder of elements, which is in fact a Stoic doctrine about the arrangement of the universe. As Allan Scott shows, Philo admits the Stoic doctrine about the array of the cosmic elements according to their weight: earth at the bottom, water above the earth, air above the water and fire on the highest level. Fire, not ether, is the true substance of heaven. (See Scott, Origen, 66. Cf. Aet. 33; 115). The doctrine presents some contradictory points since Philo also accepts the Peripatetic view-— opposed to the Stoic one—according to which the ether is actually the substance of heaven (see Her. 87, 238; 240; 283; Deus 78; Mut. 179; Somn. 1.139; 145; QG3.6). For the idea of mystical ascent in Philo, see for example Peder Borgen, Philo of Alexandria, An Exegete for for His Time (Leiden: Brill, 1997), 194-205 (ch. 11: "Illegitimate and Legitimate Ascents").</page><page sequence="16">38 D. A. Giulea / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 23-57 According to the Philonian pedagogical curriculum, the exercise in arts and sciences (τέχναι και έπιστήμαι) should be followed by the itinerary of the human mind within the noetic world.34 The passage about the ascent of the mind given in the introduction of this paper continues in this way: And when the intellect has observed in that realm the models and forms of the sense-perceptible things (αισθητών... τά παραδείγματα και τάς Ιδέας) which it had seen here, objects of overwhelming beauty, it then, possessed by a sober drunkenness, becomes enthused like the Corybants. Filled with another longing and a higher form of desire, which has propelled it to the utmost vault of the intelligibles (των νοητών), it thinks it is heading towards the Great King himself. But as it strains to see (ίδεΐν), pure and unmixed beams (άκρατοι και αμιγείς αύγαί) of concentrated light (αθρόου φωτός) pour forth like a torrent, so that the eye of the mind (τό της διανοίας δμμα), overwhelmed by the brightness (μαρμαρυγαΐς), suffers from vertigo. {Opif. 70-770-71)35 According to Philo, the priests and the prophets, more than scientists and ordinary people, reach the highest level of humanity and become "born of God," an expression which means that they have risen wholly above the sphere of sense-perception (τό δέ αΐσθητόν πάν ύπερκΰψαντες) and have been translated into the world of the intelligible (εις τόν νοητόν κόσμον ματανέστησαν) and dwell there registered as free men of the commonwealth of Ideas, which are imperishable and incorporeal (άφθαρτων και άσωμάτων ιδεών πολιτεία). {Gig. 61) 4. Divine Mysteries and Noetic Perception Previous scholars have observed that the revelation of heavenly mysteries represents an essential feature of Jewish apocalyptic literature.36 Benjamin 341341 E.g., Congr. 11-25· As the curriculum actually has to lead to the acquisition of philo sophical knowledge, philosophy has to lead to wisdom, which is the science of divine and human things (επιστήμη θείων και άνθρωπίνων [Congr. 79]). 351 See also Leg. 1.38. Beyond these passages where Philo ascribes the ascension to the mind (considered the most important part of the soul; Opif. 69), there are also passages where he talks about the ascent of the soul beyond heavens to God, e.g., QE 2.40, 47. jr'1 See Gunter Bornkamm, "Μυστήριον κτλ," TWNT 4 (1942): 809-34, esp. 821; Row land, Open Heaven, 14; Bockmuehl, Revelation and Mysteries, 31-32; John J.

Giulea / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 23-57 39 Gladd even argues that this paradigm of thought starts with Daniel. He further notices that mystery language in apocalyptic literature is frequently connected with three epistemic capacities specialized in perceiving the heavenly and eschatological mysteries of God, namely the true eye, ear and heart, in opposition to the ordinary eye, ear and heart.37 Philo preserves the tradition of understanding mysteries as heavenly secrets and translates it into philosophical language, operating once again a noetic turn from the biblical language. Now, the epistemic capacity which Philo deems appropriate to explore the divine mysteries is the nous, the noetic perception. The intellect is highly involved in the process of initiation and embodies, in fact, the key faculty of initiation: "[T]he mind (νοΰς) soars aloft and is being initiated in the mysteries (τά του κυρίου μυστήρια μυήται) of the Lord."38 Once consecrated, the mind becomes a minister and servant (ίερωμένην διάνοιαν λεχτουργόν και θεραπευτρίδα) of God, doing everything that delights the master (Post. 184). Long before Philo, Plato was the first to compare the ascent of the mind and the noetic vision of the Ideas with the luminous experience that the initiates in mys teries gain at the culminating point of their initiation.39 In a similar fash ion, according to Philo, the itinerary the human intellect follows into the invisible and noetic realm is compared with an initiation into the divine mysteries. Eerdmans, 1998), 10; George W. E. Nickelsburg, "'Enoch' as Scientist, Sage, and Prophet: Content, Function, and Authorship in 1 Enoch," in SBL Seminar Papers, 1999 (SBLSP 38; Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars Press, 1999), 203-30, esp. 221; Benjamin Gladd, Revealing the Mys terion: The Use of Mystery in Daniel and Second Temple Judaism with Is Bearing on First Corinthians Corinthians (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2008). They make extensive investigations on the con cepts of raz, sar, and mysterion in Daniel, sapiential literature, apocalyptic and Qumran texts, Aristobulus, Artapanus, the Orphica, Pseudo-Phocylides, Philo, Josephus, and early rabbinic literature. While the origins of these terms are Babylonian and Greek, they denote—in almost all these Jewish sources—a divine or heavenly secret revealed to human knowledge. Bockmuehl, for instance, defines "mystery" in the following terms: "By 'Mys tery' is meant any reality of divine or heavenly origin specifically characterized as hidden, secret, or otherwise inaccessible to human knowledge" (Revelation and Mystery, 2). 371 Gladd, Revealing the Mysterion, 274-77. There are also some biblical references where this type of epistemic sensory language is also used in connection with the knowledge of God, e.g., Deut 29:4; 28:45; Isa 6:9-10; Jer 5:21; Ezek 12:2 (ibid.). They are directly con nected with the idea of mystery of the kingdom, for instance in Matt 13:9-13. 38&gt;38&gt; Philo, Leg. 3.71. 391 See Diotima's discourse in Symposium 210a-e. Cf.

Giulea / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 23-57 While commenting on the Passover narrative from Exodus 12, Philo avers that the passage actually refers to those who overcome the realm of passions and, thus, can have a comprehension of God through his works in creation {Leg. 3.94-99).40 In addition, there is an even more advanced stage of initiation, namely that of the direct vision of God through the nous:nous: There is a mind (νοΰς) more perfect and more thoroughly cleansed, which has undergone initiation into the great mysteries (τά μεγάλα μυστήρια μυηθείς), a mind which gains its knowledge of the First Cause (τό αϊτιον γνωρίζει) not from created things (ούκ άπό των γεγονότων), as one may learn the substance from the shadow (άπό σκιάς), but lifting its eyes above and beyond creation (ϋπερκύψας τό γενητόν) obtains a clear vision of the uncreated One (εμφασιν έναργή τοΰ άγενήτου), so as from Him to apprehend both Himself and His shadow (άπ' αΰτοΰ αυτόν καταλαμβάνειν και την σκιάν αύτοΰ). To appre hend that was, we saw, to apprehend both the Word and this world. The mind of which I speak is Moses who says, "Manifest (Έμφάνισόν) Thyself to me, let me see Thee that I may know Thee" [Exod 33:13]; 'for I would not ask that Thou shouldst be manifested (έμφανισθείης) to me by means of heaven or earth or water or air or any created thing at all (τίνος άπλώς των έν γενέσει), nor would I find the reflection of Thy being (την σήν ίδέαν) in aught else than in Thee Who art God, for the reflections in created things are dissolved (αί γαρ έν γενητοΐς έμφάσεις διαλύονται), but those in the Uncreate (αί δέ έν τω άγενήτω) will continue abiding and sure and eternal.' (Leg. 3.100-101) 5. God's Inaccessible Core and the Limit of Noetic Perception Philo not only transfers the heavenly realm and the vision to the noetic level, but adds even more refinement to his discourse about the knowl edge of God. An ancient biblical and apocalyptic feature, anthropomor phism is no longer a discursive tool for Philo's refined speech and for all those thinkers who followed the noetic paradigm, from Clement and Ori gen to Halevi, Maimonides and Gersonides. As we have seen above, there are various degrees of divine concealment and revelation or manifestation in both noetic and visible worlds. Another particular theoretical element which seems to remain a constant feature of the entire noetic trend is the 4,11 See also Sacr. 63 for the definition of the Passover as the passage from passions to the practice of virtue (την έκ παθών εις ασκησιν αρετής διάβασιν) and Sacr. 62 for the idea that this passage represents the "lesser mysteries" (τά μικρά μυστήρια).</page><page sequence="19">D. A. Giulea / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 23-57 41 postulation a dimension of the divine which remains impenetrable and inaccessible for the noetic perception, namely, the essence of God. While certain anti-anthopomorphic stances are already present in Aris tobulus, Philo is the real initiator of apophatic theology in its proper sense, namely that negative language usually employed to describe this inacces sible dimension of God.41 As Danielou and Starobinski-Safran observed, Philo developed his apophatic terminology within the exegetical context of biblical theophanies, as for example in the apparition of God to Moses or to Abraham.42 In De posteritate Caini, while describing the wise man as always longing to comprehend the Ruler of the universe (κατανοήσαι τον ηγεμόνα τοΰ παντός), the author concludes with the next skeptical passage: [I]t follows, then, that not only other things with which we are familiar, but that whose movement surpasses them all in swiftness, the mind (τό πάντων όξυκινητότατον, ό νους), would come short of the apprehension of the First Cause (της καταλήψεως τοΰ αιτίου) by an immeasurable distance (άπεριγράφοις(άπεριγράφοις... διαστήμασιν). (Post. 18-19)43 Unlike this concealed dimension of God, his external manifestation repre sents the accessible, knowable dimension of the divine. The "external" manifestation is God's divine existence (ϋπαρξις), in the sense of ek-stasis, ex-sistentiaex-sistentia (the outward manifestation of the unmanifested principle), also called God's active power (δύναμις), glory, or rays. The following passage from De posteritate Caini illustrates this idea: 411 See Harry A. Wolfson, Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and Islam (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1947), 121-58 and Ekkehard Miihlen berg, Die Unendlichkeit Gottes bei Gregor von Nyssa (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1966), 58-64.

Wherefore in the great Song there come these words as from the lips of God, "See, see that 1 AM" (Deut 32:39), showing that He that actually is (τοΰ δντως δντος) is apprehended by clear intuition (άντικαταλαμβανομένου) rather than demonstrated by arguments carried on in words. When we say that the Existent One (τό δν) is visible (όρατόν), we are not using words in their literal sense, but it is an irregular use of the word by which it is referred to each one of His powers. In the passage just quoted He does not say "See Me," for it is impossible that the God who is should be perceived (κατανοηθηναι) at all by created beings. What he says is "See that I AM," that is "Behold My subsistence (ϋπαρξιν)." For it is quite enough for a mans reasoning faculty to advance as far as to learn that the Cause of the Universe is and subsists (εστι τε και υπάρχει). To be anxious to continue his course yet further, and inquire about essence or quality (ουσίας ή ποιότητος) in God, is a folly fit for the worlds childhood. Not even to Moses, the all-wise, did God accord this, albeit he had made countless requests, but a divine communica tion was issued to him, "Thou shalt behold that which is behind Me, but my Face thou shalt not see" (Exod 33:23). This meant, that all that follows in the wake of God is within the good man's apprehension (καταληπτά), while He Himself alone is beyond it (αυτός δέ μόνος άκατάλεπτος), beyond, that is, in the line of straight and direct approach, a mode of approach by which (had it been possible) His quality would have been made known; but brought within ken by the powers that follow and attend Him. (των επομένων και άκολούθων δυνάμεων καταληπτός); for these make evident not His essence (ού την ούσίαν) but His subsistence (την δ' ΰπαρξιν) from the things which He accomplishes (έκ των άποτελουμένων).'14 As we will further see, Exod 33:23 will remain the central biblical refer ence for future Jewish and Christian authors regarding this vital distinc tion of the noetic tradition between God's essence and his manifestations. As the text about God's appearances follows immediately after Philo's excursus about God's incomprehensibility, the two ideas are strongly con nected and certainly equally valid at the same time. While defending a strict apophaticism of the divine essence (ousia), the author still agrees 44י Post. 167-169.

The Noetic Turn in Its Major Lines of Development: Jewish Thought The noetic turn will constitute a major trend in Judaism and Christianity in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The distinction between noetic and aesthetic, essential for the Platonic and Aristotelian systems, will play a similarly critical role in many philosophically inspired Jewish and Chris tian speculations until a new philosophical paradigm, namely, German transcendentalism from Kant to Hegel to Fichte to Schleiermacher, will inspire a new theological paradigm. In the following pages I will point out some of the most important representatives of the mainstream Jewish and Christian theological and philosophical views in order to offer the reader a glimpse of the wide extension this paradigm had in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.46 The noetic turn will re-emerge at the rise of classical Jewish philosophy and become a locus communis in the writings of such main stream authors as Sa'adiah, Judah Halevi, Maimonides and Gersonides.47 As Gad Freudenthal shows, Sa'adiah Gaon, already at the beginning of the tenth century, calls God "the worlds Intellect" ('aql al-dlam), an expression rendered in Hebrew as da at ha-olam u-vinat ha-olam.48 This note is significant because it confirms that already in the tenth century 45) See Spec. 1.41-49 for ουσία vs. δόξα, δυνάμεις, ένέργειαι. Cf. Deus 61-62 and Somn. 1.230-231 for the distinction between ov and ϋπαρξις. 461 A detailed investigation of all the authors and theological and philosophical systems who developed the noetic paradigm, with all their theoretical contexts and details, would require a future investigation larger than an article. 471 To a certain extent, calling them philosophers might suggest a particular separation from theology. They were, in fact, as much theologians as Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Wil liam Occam. They wrote extensive commentaries on the Bible and, in addition to this, Sa'adiah and Maimonides were rabbis. Consequently, they were philosophically educated theologians as aforementioned Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Occam. This idea is significant because it shows us that both trends—the philosophical and the everyday biblical— coexisted in the frames of the same religious culture.

Wolfson, at first, shows that Judah Halevi describes the world of the heavenly merkavah as spiritual: [T]he world of spiritual entities, alam al-ruhaniyyan ('olam ha-ruhaniyyim), is identified with the aggadic Pardes which is understood by Halevi as the celestial throne-world. "That is to say, therefore, that in this case at least the spiritual entities comprise the array of objects known from the pleroma of the merkavah mystics: the glory, the attendant angels, the chariot, and the throne.55 Halevi conceives of the biblical expression the "holy spirit" as a spiritual and ethereal substance and the "Glory of God" as a manifestation of this substance in various forms: A very subtle physical visage may surround a spiritual (הרוחני) entity, and this is known as the "Holy Spirit." Spiritual images called the "Glory of God" [such as that which descended upon Mount Sinai] are really made up of this visage.5^ He envisions the "Glory" either as a spiritual substance taking different forms or as the whole merkavah universe: As to the term "Glory [k'vod'} of God": the more literal meaning refers to the ethereal entity (הדק ההולך) controlled by Gods will to appear in an image, representing how God wishes to appear to the prophet. The broader meaning includes the angels and spiritual vessels, such as "the throne," "the chariot," "the firmament," "the wheels," "the wheelworks," and other entities which exist eternally. These are thus called "Glory of God," just as a king's vessels {"kevudah"]{" kevudah"] are called his glory, as in "and the vessels before him."57 Halevi makes also the distinction between the accessible part of this heav enly universe—throne, angels, to which should be added the back parts of God—and the inaccessible one, the face of God: 551 Ibid., 190-91. 561 Kuzari 2.4.3 (Korobkin). Kuzari 1.87.3 equates the Holy Spirit and the Active Intellect (השכל הפועל), while 1.1.15 identifies the Active Intellect with an angel and 1.1.20 describes it as an ethereal entity (רוחני ההוא). 571 Kuzari 4.3.49 (Korobkin).</page><page sequence="24">46 D. A. Giulea / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 Perhaps this is what Moshe was referring to when he said, "Please show me Your Glory," to which God acquiesced, provided that Moshe would not look at His face, which no mortal is able to do. [It was this Glory] to which God referred when He said, "You will see My back." This Glory [has various com ponents], some of which can be perceived by prophetic vision. The lowest level can be perceived even by ordinary man; the "cloud" and the "consuming fire" are two which were commonly seen. But the Glory gradually ascends in its ethereality until it reaches a level which no prophet can perceive.5" In addition, Wolfson shows that the terms "spiritual" and "intellectual" function as synonyms and denote the same celestial throne-world: Halevi describes the fate of another rabbi who entered the Pardes, Elisha ben Abuyah, as degrading the commandments "after contemplating the Intellects (אלעקליאת)".(אלעקליאת)." From this context, then, it may be concluded that Halevi iden tifiedtified the mystical Pardes with the realm of spiritual beings which are the immaterial Intellects.מ Halevi is not unique. Wolfson mentions, too, a document which discloses the same terminology and philosophical paradigm, namely the Pseudo Empedoclean Book of Five Substances: In that text one reads about an "intellectual vision" (הראות השכלי) through which one can know the spiritual or intelligible forms (רוחניות צורות שכליות) which are the "impressions (or traces) of God" (השי״ת רשומי) within the world of the Intellect (6.(עולם השכל" Maimonides also identifies the angels which move the heavenly spheres with Aristotelian separate intellects: This is also what Aristotle says. But there is a difference in the terms; for he speaks of separate intellects (עקול מפארקה), and we speak of angels [T] hese separate intellects are also intermediaries between God, may He be 581 Kuzari 4.3.49-50 (Korobkin). In 4.3.12 Halevi expressely affirms that God's essence is incomprehensible. Maimonides professes a similar opinion that Moses asks for something which is beyond human epistemic capacities, namely the essence of God; see Guide 3.9; cf. Herbert A. Davidson, Moses Maimonides: The Man and His Works (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 338 and Kellner, Maimonides Confrontation, 194-98. w) Wolfson, "Merkavah Traditions," 191. ft" Ibid., 193.</page><page sequence="25">D.

Since the whole realm is conceived of nine hosts of angels and the Active Intellect, Maimonides depicts the heaven as consisting of ten distinct categories of intellects: The globes are nine according to their [i.e., philosophers who followed Aris totle] reckoning; namely, the one that encompasses the universe, the sphere of the fixed stars, and the spheres of the seven planets. The tenth intellect is the Active Intellect.62 Gersonides also identifies the light of the first day of creation with the separate intellects, namely the angels.63 There is, however, a significant distinction between the noetic universes envisioned by the Greek philoso phers and that of the Jewish and Christian theologians. The entities which populate the religious noetic universes are thrones, angels and glory, instead of abstract noetic ideas which function as paradigms of the things that inhabit the visible world.64 From an epistemological perspective, Jewish medieval theologians distin guish between the epistemic faculty used in a visio Dei and the ordinary sight. For instance, Wolfson shows that they used various synonymous expressions to denote this capacity, most of them of biblical and rabbinic origins, such as "the spiritual eye," "the inner eye," "the vision of the heart," 611 Guide 2.6 (Pines, 262). Cf. Halevi, Kuzari 4.3.47. f'2) Guide 2Λ (Pines, 257). 631 Wars 6.2.5 (Feldman, 3:438): "This light refers to the Separate Intelligences that are the movers of the heavenly bodies." It is in the same chapter that he discusses whether the human intellect is able or not to apprehend this primordial light. Gersonides affirms that, unlike Rabbi Juda bar Simon who denies it, all the other Rabbis consider that the intellect can perceive this light, although not perfectly. Moreover, the apprehension of the primor dial light procures immortality. 641 Wolfson mentions the existence of this idea in Jewish medieval texts: "These forms [mentioned in the Book of the Five Substances] are akin to the Plotinian conception of intelligiblesintelligibles (τά νοητά) within the second hypostasis, Nous, that make up the intelligible world (κοσμός νοητός). Yet, for Halevi, the spiritual forms are not simply the intelligible ideas within the mind of God; they assume the character of the entities known from the world of ancient Jewish throne-mysticism" (Wolfson, "Merkavah Traditions," 193-94).</page><page sequence="26">48 D. A. Giulea /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 etc. Wolfson's conclusion is that all these expressions refer to intellectual perception: That is to say, in the Islamic-Jewish Neoplatonic tradition the vision of the heart is an intellectual intuition of that which is incorporeal and thus invisible in a physical sense. The eye of the heart (עין הלב) is synonymous with the eye of the intelect (5׳/(עין השכל This epistemic capacity, however, is restricted to the prophets and pious people, as Halevi shows: The prophets thus undoubtedly see this Divine realm with their inner eye (בעין הנסתרת), and are witness to images (צורות) that are appropriate to their nature. They describe these images as if they had physically seen them. Their descriptions are correct in relation to what one's discretion, imagination, and perception (המחשב והדמיון והחוש) perceive, but are not correct with regard to the actual entity about which they are prophesysing, which is what the intellect (השכל) seeks.66 Thus, the whole Halevian analysis of the visio Dei phenomenon reaches new complexities in terms of psychological processes and explanations. Halevi and also Maimonides, postulate the existence of a prophetic faculty which perceives the heavenly realm and mediates the vision to the intellect, namely imagination.67 Halevi critiques the Greek philosophers who thought that this sublime contemplation could be experienced directly through the intellect alone, without the mediation of imaginative faculty: ,י5'־ Ibid., 222. M) Kuzeri 4.3.36 (Korobkin). Cf. 4.3.34 and 37. i7&gt; See Maimonides, 2.36 (Pines, 369): "Know that the true reality and quiddity of prophecy consist in its being an overflow overflowing from God, may He be cherished and honoured, through the intermediation of the Active Intellect, toward the rational faculty in the first place and thereafter toward the imaginative faculty. This is the highest degree of man and the ultimate term of perfection that can exist for his species; and this state is the ultimate term of perfection for the imaginative faculty." A few lines later, Maimonides offers a definition of the imaginative faculty: "You know, too, the actions of the imaginative faculty that are in its nature, such as retaining things perceived by the senses, combining these things, and imitating them. And you know that its greatest and noblest action takes place only when the senses rest and do not perform their actions. It is then that a certain overflow overflows to this faculty according to its disposition, and it is the cause of the veridical dreams. This same overflow is the cause of the prophecy" (Pines, 370).</page><page sequence="27">D. A. Giulea / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 23-57 49 Do not believe the philosopher who claims that his thoughts are properly attuned to the order of things to the point where he comprehends all the essential aspects of Godliness—using his intellect (בשכלו) alone, without the need for physical representations, and that all he needs to see are certain words, writings, or pictures of real or imaginary scenes... Without a physical manifestation to effectively represent all the necessary aspects of the Divine order, these ideas cannot penetrate into the intellect (68.(השכלי Jewish commentators talk about imagination because they conceive of the vision of God through a unique and momentary grasp of the intellect too close to perfection and to the way God sees everything in the universe through a unique perception of his intellect. The human intellect, of its own accord, is not able to perceive the essence of things. Such insight may be granted by a special grace, but even in that case it would be of only certain types of objects.69 Prophets always have a very complex vision in which all the details are received through the internal eye: "He sees in the vision all the qualities and instruments which indicate God's ability, such as an outstretched arm, a drawn sword, fire, wind, lightening, thunder, etc."70 Halevi informs his reader that the intellect does function during the vision as an epistemic faculty which combines all the details received through the imaginative powers in a unitary vision: God granted an "internal eye" (עץ נסתרת) [that is, prophecy] to a select group, which allows them to see certain fixed entities with their own eyes. In turn, their intellects (השכל) use these visions to comprehend these entities and their internal workings... These people's internal eyes are possibly like having the power of imagination (הכת המדמה) while the intellect is active.71 Nevertheless, as Maimonides affirms, one of the mortals actually enjoyed a visiovisiovisio Dei directly through the intellect, namely Moses: "the imaginative faculty did not enter into his prophecy, peace be on him, as the intellect overflowed toward him without its intermediation."72 Maimonides also thinks that the vision of God in general should not be understood in a literal way, as the Onkelos does, but in an intellectual fashion: 681 Halevi, Kuzari 4.5.2 (Korobkin). 691 Ibid., 4.3.31. 7'" Ibid., 4.5.3 (Korobkin). 7" Ibid., 4.3.34 (Korobkin). 721 Maimonides, Guide 2.36 (Pines, 373).</page><page sequence="28">50 D. A. Giulea / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 23-57 Know that the three words to see [ra'oh], to look at {habbit], and to vision [hazoh][hazoh\ are applied to the sight of the eye and that all three of them are also used figuratively to denote the grasp of the intellect (לאדראך אלעקל). As for the verb to see, this is generally admitted by the multitude. Thus it says: And he he saw, and behold a well in the field. This refers to the sight of the eye. But it also says: Yea, my heart hath seen much of wisdom and knowledge; and this refers to intellectual apprehension (אדראך עקלי). Every mention of seeing, when referring to God, may He be exalted, has this figurative meaning—as when Scripture says: I saw the Lord; And the Lord became seen to him; And God saw saw that it was good; I beseech Thee, let me see Thy glory; And they saw the God of of Israel. All this refers to intellectual apprehension (אדראך עקלי) and in no way to the eye's seeing, as the eye can only apprehend a body, one that is placed in some direction and, in addition, with some of the accidents of the body, I mean the body's coloring, shape, and so forth.73 All these texts lead to the partial conclusion that medieval Jewish thinkers, as Philo almost one millennium before them, translate the key elements of the apocalyptic ontology—the heavenly throne, angels and glory—through noetic terminologies.74 Likewise, noetic perception replaces apocalyptic epistemic faculties. 7. The Noetic Turn in Its Major Lines of Development: Christian Thought In order to have a better perspective of the wide-ranging influence of the noetic turn we have to mention, too, the Hellenizing Christian context. The noetic turn has a very early and powerful impact within Christian environment. I will limit my discussion to some general observations on two significant authors of the earliest period, Clement and Origen.75 ™ Ibid., 1.4 (Pines, 27-28). For the distinction between Maimonides' philosophy and targumic interpretation of biblical theophanies, especially regarding the vision of the kuvodkuvodkuvodkavod and shekhina, see Menachem Kellner, Maimonides Confrontation with Mysticism (Oxford; The Littrnan Library of Jewish Civilization, 2006), 189-215. 741 Wolfson and Moshe Idel, for instance, show that merkavab and hekhalot traditions are essential in understanding Halevi's key theological assumptions; for Idel, see "The World of Angels in Human Form" [Hebrew], in Studies in Philosophy, Mysticism, and Ethical Litera tureture Presented to Isaiah Tishby on His Seventy-Fifth Birthday (ed. J. Dan and J. Hacker; Jerusalem: Magnus, 1986), 1-66, esp. 15-19. 751 Many other authors, actually the most representative among the Greek and Latin authors from Athanasius to Thomas Aquinas and Occam, should be mentioned here. For a</page><page sequence="29">D. A. Giulea /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 51 The doctrine of a noetic translation regarding God's nature and the heavenly beings receives one of its clearest illustrations in Clement of Alex andria. Already the Protreptikos shows that God himself and his image or representation/statue (agalma) are noetic, not aesthetic: ήμΐν δέ ούχ ϋλης αισθητής αίσθητόν, νοητόν δέ τό άγαλμα έστιν. Νοητόν, ούκ αΐσθητόν έστι [τό άγαλμα] ό θεός, ό μόνος δντως θεός.76 While responding to Theo dotus's commentaries on the Johannine prologue and also on the titles of the Logos, Clement affirms that none of the existing realities is without form and substance. He expressly formulates this general philosophical principle in these words: While every thing that has come to be has a substance, [noetic beings] have a different form and a different body than the bodies of this world... The Monogenes is peculiarly noetic and possesses his proper form and substance, exceedingly pure and absolutely sovereign, and enjoys the power of the Father without mediation.77 Clement also clarifies that neither the pneumatic and noetic beings (τά πνευματικά πνευματικά και νοερά), nor the Archangels, nor the Protoctists, nor even the Son himself can be without form, shape, figure, and body (άμορφος και άνείδος και άσχημάτιστος και ασώματος).78 In addition to this, the Alexandrian conceives of degrees of materiality between all these celestial scholarly investigation of the idea of divine sense (nous/noesis) in Christian authors, see Anna N. Williams, The Divine Sense: The Intellect in Patristic Theology (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press, 2007). Christian Hellenistic authors will take over the Platonic distinction between the noetic and the aesthetic and sometimes further develop it in such new theories as the famous Origenian doctrine of the five noetic senses. With no doubt, Christian patristic authors read Philo and it is very plausible that the Alexandrian was one of the most (if not the most) important sources of inspiration regarding the application of the Greek philosophical language to theology. See, for instance, David T. Runia, Philo in Early Early Christian Literature: A Survey (Van Gorcum: Assen, 1993); idem, Philo and the Church Fathers: A Fathers: A Collection of Papers (Leiden: Brill, 1995). 7i| Protr. 4.51.6 {ANF 2:186): "But we have no sensible image of sensible matter, but an image that is perceived by the mind alone,—God, who alone is truly God." 771 Extr.

Giulea / Journal for the Study of Judaism 42 (2011) 23-57 entities. He shows that stars, for instance, are immaterial and without form (άσώματα και άνείδεα) compared to the earthly things. Stars are, however, measured and sensible bodies (σώματα μεμετρημένα και αισθητά) from the perspective to the Son, and similarly the Son as seen from the perspec tive of the Father.79 The same idea is similarly expressed through light vocabulary, and celestial realities are also described as noetic. The angels, as noetic spirits (πνεύματα νοερά) by their nature, are not completely imma terial, but have a body of noetic fire (νοερόν πυρ). Moreover, there is a light in which the angelic beings themselves ardently desire to partake, a more purified light than theirs, which Clement calls noetic (φως νοερόν). Nevertheless, Clement describes the Son as an even purer light than the noetic one, and, employing a Pauline expression from 1 Tim 6:16, entitles it "inaccessible light (άπρόσιτον Φως)." Finally, Clement identifies it with the "Power of God (Δύναμις Θεοΰ)" from 1 Cor 1:24.80 The Alexandrian advances another similar point, but this time from an epistemological perspective. Assuming the principle that neither the seer nor the seen can be without form and body (To τοίνυν όρων και όρώμενον άσχημάτιστον είναι οϋ δύναται ούδέ άσώματον), he observes that the seven Protoctists (the first created heavenly beings) always contemplate the Face of the Father, which is the Son. Consequently, the Son has to have a form and body in order to allow the Protoctists the possibility to see him.81 However, the theologian observes that the epistemic capacity through which the Protoctists can see the Son is not an ordinary one. It is not the sensible eye, but the noetic eye given from the Father (όφθαλμω ούκ αίσθητω, άλλ' οϊω παρέσχεν ό Πατήρ, νοερω).82 Following the same line of reasoning, Origen conceives of the inhabit ants of heaven, angelic and human beings as spiritual bodies consisting in a shiny materiality: Now as we have said above, material substance (materialis substantia) pos sesses such a nature (naturam) that it can undergo every kind of transforma tiontion {transformetur). When therefore it is drawn down to lower beings {ad inferiores)inferiores) it is formed [formatur) into the grosser and more solid condition of body (corporis statum) and serves to distinguish the visible species of this world in all their variety. But when it ministers to more perfect (perfection ימ Extr. Theod. 11.3 (SC 23:82). ""י Ibid., 12.2-3 (SC 23:83). """" Ibid., 10.6 (SC 23:80). "2, Ibid.</page><page sequence="31">D. A.

All these beings go to make up the diverse and varying condition of the one world.83 The idea is clearer when considered in light of another text which states that only the Trinity is completely immaterial or bodiless: But if it is impossible by any means to maintain this proposition, namely, that any being (natura), with the exception of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, can live apart from a body {corpus), then logical reasoning compels us to believe that, while the original creation was of rational beings (rationabiles naturas), it is only in idea and thought that a material substance (materialem substantiam) is separable from them, and that though this substance seems to have been produced for them or after them, yet never have they lived or do they live without it; for we shall be right in believing that life without a body (incor poreaporea uita) is found in the Trinity alone.84 At the same time, Origen still defines God through the biblical and kabod terms of light and glory. As the Father is the true Light (lux) and Glory {gloria),{gloria), the Son represents his splendor (splendor) in the form of God (forma(forma dei).85 While there are instances where Origen describes the light of God as a metaphor, he also affirms the existence of an intelligible light 831 Origen, Princ. 2.2.2 (SC 252:248).

In Cels 6.77 (SC 147:370) Origen affirms that the apostles saw on Mount Tabor the transfigured body (σώμα) of Jesus. See also the stress on the corporeality of the glorious form in Fr. Lk. 140. Nevertheless, Origen prac tices a certain precaution, if not a complete rejection, in describing the shape which the glory of a spiritual body may have; cf. Princ. 2.10.2 (SC 252:379). M) Princ. 2.2.2 (SC 252:246-48 [trans. Butterworth). See also Princ. 1.6.4 (SC 252:206 [trans. Butterworth]): "we believe that to exist without material substance (material! sub stantia)stantia) apart from any association with a bodily element (corporcae adicctionis) is a thing that belongs only to the nature of God (dei nature), that is, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit." Cf. Princ. 4.3.15 (SC 268:396-98 [trans. Butterworth]): "But the substance of the Trinity (substantia trinitatis)... must not be believed either to be a body or to exist in a body, but to be wholly incorporeal (ex toto incorporea)." Cf. Princ. 4.4.1 and 4.4.5: natura trinitatis trinitatis (SC 268:402 and 412). 851 Princ. 1.2.7-8 (SC 252:124-28). See below that the form of God represents the lumi nous and glorious dimension Christ reveals to his disciples on Mount Tabor. Origen under stands the Incarnation as the process of taking off (exinaniens se filius) this glorious form and putting on the human flesh (see also Princ. 1.2.8 [SC 252:126]).</page><page sequence="32">54 D.

If then the heavenly powers (caelestes uirtutes) receive a share of intellectual light, that is, of the divine nature (diuinae naturae), in virtue of the fact that they share in wisdom and sanctification, and if the soul of man receives a share of the same light and wisdom, then these beings will be of one nature (naturae) and one substance (substantiae) with each other. But the heavenly powers are incorruptible and immortal; undoubtedly there fore the substance of the soul of man will also be incorruptible and immortal. And not only so, but since the nature (natura) of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, to whom alone belongs the intellectual light (intellectualis lucis) in which the universal creation has a share, is incorruptible and eternal, it follows logically and of necessity that every existence (substantiam) which has a share in that eternal nature (naturae) must itself also remain for ever incorruptible and eternal, in order that the eternity of the divine goodness may be revealed in this additional fact, that they who obtain its blessings are eternal too. Never theless, just as in our illustrations we acknowledged some diversity in the reception of the light, when we described the individual power of sight as being either dim or keen, so also we must acknowledge a diversity of partici pation in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, varying in proportion to the ear nestness of the soul (intentione sensus) and the capacity of the mind (mentis capacitate) .*ךcapacitate) .*ךcapacitate) .*ך Origen asserts a number of times that ordinary epistemological capacities cannot perceive God, but the visionary must actualize special faculties in order to fathom beyond the visible universe. The Alexandrian refers then to intellect or mind {nous), and formulates the second epistemological principle: intelligible things are perceived through intellection. In this way, Moses, the prophets, and the apostles actually did not see God, but rather understood him: י'״ E.g., Princ. 1.1.1 (SC 252:90-92); Comm. ]oh. 1.151-183 (SC 120:136-50); 13.132 137 (SC 222:100-104).

For he who noetically perceived (intellexerit) the Son has perceived noetically (intellexerit) the Father also. It is in this manner then that must suppose Moses to have seen (uidisse) God, not by looking (intuens) at him with eyes of flesh (oculis carnalibus), but by perceiving intellectually (intellegens)(intellegens) him with the vision of the heart (uisu cordis) and the perception of the mind (sensu mentis), and even this in part only. For it is well-known that he, that is, the one who gave the oracles to Moses, says, 'Thou shalt not see (uidebis) my face, but my back' (Exod 33:23). Certainly these statements must be understood by the aid of that symbolism (sacramento) which is appro priate to the understanding of divine sayings, and those old wives' fables, which ignorant people invent on the subject of the front and back parts of God, must be utterly rejected and despised.88 As As nous is also called "vision of the heart," "perception of the mind," and many other names, the famous doctrine of the noetic senses enters the scene at this point of the discussion.89 Besides this, the text unveils the fact 881 Princ. 2.4.3 (SC 252:286 [trans. Buttcrworth, slightly modified]). 891 See also Princ. 1.1.9 (SC 252:108-10 [trans. Butterworth]): "But if the question is put to us why it was said, 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God' (Matt. 5:8), I answer that in my opinion our argument will be much more firmly established by this passage. For what else is 'to see God in the heart' but to understand and know him with the mind {menu cum intellcgcrc atquc cognosccre), just as we have explained above? For the names of the organs of sense are often applied to the soul, so that we speak of seeing with the eyes of the heart, that is, of drawing some intellectual (intclUctuale) conclusions by means of the faculty of intelligence (uirtutc intclligcntiac). So too we speak of hearing with the ears when we discern the deeper meaning of some statement. So too we speak of the soul as being able to use teeth, when it eats and consumes the bread of life which comes down from heaven. In a similar way we speak of it as using all the other bodily organs, which are transferred from their corporeal significance and applied to the faculties of the soul; as Solomon says, 'You will find a divine sense' (Scnsum diuinum inuenies) (Prov 2:5). For he knew that there were in us two kinds of senses (scnsuum), the one being mortal, cor ruptible and human (mortale, corruptibik, humanum), and the other immortal and intel lectual {immortalc et intclUctuale), which here he calls 'divine' {diuinum). By this divine sense (scnsu diuino), therefore, not of the eyes but of a pure heart, that is, the mind (mens), God may be seen (uidert) by those who are worthy {digni)." See also Dial. 16-24 (SC 67: 88-102), one of the most illustrative passages on the doctrine of the noetic senses. Butter worth observes that Origen's reading of Prov 2:5, preserved in the Greek version in Ccls. 7.34 (SC 150:92), is not identical with that of the Septuagint; while the scriptural phrase is έπίγνωσιν θεοΰ εύρήσεις, Origen reads αϊσβησιν θείαν εΰρήσεις; see Butterworth, Origen, 14.</page><page sequence="34">56 D. A. Giulea / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 42 (2011) 23-57 that Origen elaborated this doctrine in the intellectual context of the anthropomorphic debate. In one of their penetrating insights, both Henri Crouzel and John Dillon made the connection between biblical anthropo morphisms—therefore the vision of the form of God—and Origen's doc trine of noetic senses.90 Commenting on Origen's Contra Celsum 1.48 and 7.34, Dillon remarks: It is plain that he has here developed a systematic theory of analogical, "spiri tual" senses for the intellect, or hegemonikon, apparently to solve a series of problems of exegesis posed by anthropomorphic expressions about the godhead and about spiritual life which abound in both the Old and New Testaments.1" 8. Conclusion The use of Greek philosophical terminology in the texts of several classical Jewish and Christian authors such as Philo, Clement, Origen, Halevi, Maimonides, and Gersonides does not represent a mere Greek color attached to their discourse. To the contrary, it deeply affects and substan tiallytially reshapes the Jewish theological vision in its main ontological and epistemological categories. Biblical and apocalyptic ontologies and episte mologies, generally conceived according to the norms and categories of everyday knowledge are translated and re-conceived according to the dis tinction between the aesthetic and the noetic. Heavenly realities are re defined through noetic categories and new ontological doctrines regarding the levels of divine concealment and manifestation are now elaborated. Human access to the divine is re-conceived through sophisticated episte *" See also Crouzel, Origene et la connaissance, 262 and John Dillon, "Aisthesis Noete■. A Doctrine of Spiritual Senses in Origen and in Plotinus," in Hellenica et Judaica: HommageHommage a a a Valentin Nikiprowetsky (ed. A. Caquot et al.; Leuven: Peeters, 1986), 443-55. Dillon also shows that there are some traces for a noetic correlate of sense-perception in the Platonist heritage before Origen. For other secondary sources on the idea of spiritual senses, see, for instance, Karl Rahner, "Le debut d'une doctrine des cinq sens spirituels chez Origene," RAM RAM 13 (1932): 113-45; Crouzel, Origene et la connaissance, 505-7; Marguerite Harl, "La 'bouche' et le 'cceur' de lapotre: Deux images bibliques du 'sens divin de Phomme ('Pro verbes' 2, 5) chez Origene," in Forma Futuri: Studi in onore del Cardinale Michele Pellegrino (Turin: Bottega d'Erasmo, 1975), 17-42; or Bernard Julien-Fraigneau, Les sens spirituels et la vision de Dieu chez saint Symeon le Nouveaula vision de Dieu chez saint Symeon le Nouveaula vision de Dieu chez saint Symeon le Nouveau Theologien (Paris: Beauchesne, 1985). ,״ Dillon, "Aisthesis Noete" 445; cf. 449.</page><page sequence="35">D.D.

In addition, the representatives of the noetic trajectory frequently take anti-anthropomorphic stances and postulate that God's essence is beyond human noetic perception. A new hermeneutical rule appears several times in the writings of these authors: they criticize the literal reading and the anthropomorphic language of the Bible and apocalyptic literature, and manifest discontent with the every day epistemological language of the Bible, apocalyptic literature and literal interpreters. Consequently, the noetic turn represents a fundamental change in Jew ish theological discourse, perhaps the most important after that from pro phetic literature to apocalypticism. Its emergence, however, does not put an end to the apocalyptic discourse in Jewish and Christian thought, but critiques and reformulates the basic ontology and epistemology of biblical and apocalyptic thought. Beginning with Philo, the noetic and the apoca lyptic paradigms will coexist for centuries in both Jewish and Chistian cultures. Most likely, the noetic turn will entail an axial trend in Jewish and Christian thinking, introducing all these key philosophico-theologi cal structures in the theorization of numerous classical Jewish and Chris tian authors of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.</page></plain_text>
