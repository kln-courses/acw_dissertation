<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL? by Peter Alexander and Peter Downing I Peter Alexander (In representing causal statements I shall use o, fi, . . .for individuals and A, B, . . . for kinds or classes of individuals. I shall also use "things" intentionally as an ambiguous term for objects or events.) I. THE PROBLEM It is presumably admitted that laws, whether causal or not, are universal in form; they are appropriately stated in universal categoricals or unrestricted hypotheticals. I assume that this is not at issue in the question set. I take our question to be this: given that causal laws are universal statements, can they be said to be about, to apply to, to hold for, individual things? To say that they are purely general would be to say that they are about, apply to, hold for, not individual things but only kinds or classes of things. This would imply that there are no irreducibly singular causal statements, that singular causal statements are disguised causal laws or that the meaning of "causal" essentially involves generality because it involves the idea of constant conjunction. Mario Bunge (Causality, N.Y. 1963), although putting an anti-Humean view, says "single scientific laws, of whatever kind, do not hold for concrete, specific, individual instances; scientific laws hold only for classes of facts" (p. 270). Henry Margenau (The Nature of Physical Reality, N.Y. 1950) holds the principle of causality to be ". . . a metaphysical requirement. It demands that (theoretical) constructs shall be so chosen as to generate causal laws" and, he says, "We wish to regard causality as a relation (not between immediate experiences, 15</page><page sequence="2">16 PETER ALEXANDER but) between constructs, in particular as a relation between states, or conditions, of physical systems. The principle of causality asserts that a given state is invariably followed, in time, by another specifiable state ... causality is a property of physical laws and not of observations" (p. 95) and again "there is no causality among matters of fact ... even when the transition from partial to total causes is made" (pp. 395-6). Such views are familiar from writings in the philosophy of science. Bernard Mayo has recently argued differently ("The Incoherence of Determinism", Philosophy, April 1969) but with similar effect. The view that there are no irreducibly singular causal state- ments seems to me, and has seemed to others, implausible and inconvenient. We make singular causal statements without supposing that they are disguised laws and without, apparently, having experience of constant conjunction between the cause and the effect. Some philosophers regard historians as using singular causal statements as the basis for generalization. There is something strange about saying that any causal statement is general but not to be contrasted with singular causal statements which say the same except in respect of their generality. Finally, we normally regard both singular causal statements and causal laws as stating a stronger relation between cause and effect than regularity views allow. I propose to attempt to remove some of the difficulties attached to saying that there are irreducibly singular causal statements from which causal laws may be reached by generalizing, in the belief that this will help to show that causal laws need not be purely general. I rely to a large extent on the writings of C. J. Ducasse, William Dray, Richard Taylor and Max Black. I think that all their views present unresolved problems but that they contain valuable suggestions for a plausible account of singular causal statements which is closer to common sense than some more usual views. II. SOME MISCONCEPTIONS I believe that discussions of causality have been bedevilled by a number of misconceptions, some of them resulting from mere</page><page sequence="3">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? 17 prejudices, others from the desire to grind certain empiricist axes. There is a tendency to separate everyday ideas of causality from the idea of causality in the physical sciences and to regard everyday ideas as crude and uninteresting by com- parison. However, there is little evidence that "cause" is a scientific technical term; there is no theory to which one would immediately turn to find out what it meant; one does not find entries under this heading in dictionaries or encyclopaedias of science or special definitions of it in actual scientific writings. So much is this so that some philosophers have argued that scientists do not use the concept at all. I believe this is to go too far. Although scientists seldom use the word "cause" in their technical writings, they frequently use the word "effect", and related words, and even more frequently, I believe, the concept of cause. "Cause" is used as a technical term only by some philosophers of science (e.g., E. Nagel and F. S. C. Northrop), when one suspects that causal necessity is sometimes confused with the necessity associated with deducibility. When scientists do use the concept, it seems clear to me that they take it over from everyday discourse as one with which we are all familiar and which needs no special definition. I await evidence to the contrary from actual technical scientific writings; I remain dissatisfied with the unsupported statements made by philosophers of science. Those who wish to distinguish a scientific from the everyday concept appear to be putting forward an interpretation of the sciences which is subservient to certain epistemological and logical beliefs which we need not accept. I have no objection to the use of technical terms by philosophers as long as it is clear what they are doing; my complaint here is that an inaccurate picture of scientific discourse is likely to result. I believe that light can be thrown on the sciences by an understanding of everyday uses of the concept of cause because the same concept figures in the sciences. My next point is that discussions of causality have often been influenced by ulterior motives which obscure the main issues. I take the main issues to concern the meaning of "cause" and the criteria for applying it to complex cases. However, many who have discussed causality have hoped thereby to solve the</page><page sequence="4">18 PETER ALEXANDER problem of induction or to save the thesis of extensionality and the main reason for adopting a regularity view appears to lie in Humean beliefs about observability. But one who is con- cerned to elucidate the meanings of causal statements is under no obligation to make life easier for the formal logician or the Humean empiricist; his obligation is to discover what we do mean by them rather than to say what we ought to mean by them in view of certain logical and epistemological beliefs. A. I. Melden ("Desires as Causes of Actions" in F. C. Dommeyer, ed., Current Philosophical Issues, Springfield, Illinois, 1966) has referred to the application of the Humean causal model to the relation between desires and actions as "a really first-rate philosophical error" (p. 150). This is a remark with considerable historical point since the influence of Hume has been so powerful that even some philosophers who are anxious to reject the Humean model appear to have difficulty in avoiding some of its doubtful features. There is an enduring tendency to confuse the meaning of "cause" with the criteria for applying it to various situations and consequently, I believe, to regard causal laws as purely general. III. HUME'S ACCOUNT It is worth looking briefly at Hume's analysis in an attempt to pinpoint the origins of some of my difficulties. It is probably obvious that our present question arises directly and most sharply from it. It is consequent on Hume's definition of "cause" in terms of constant conjunction that there cannot be irreducibly singular causal statements and that all causal statements are law-like and purely general. This is the point of his statement that we are able to draw "from a thousand instances, an inference which we are not able to draw from one instance that is, in no respect, different from them" (Inquiry, VII, 2). The causal relation cannot hold between individual things but only between kinds or classes of things; to say that the lighting of that match caused that explosion is really to say that the explosion followed the lighting of the match and that, in such conditions, explosions invariably follow the lighting of matches. The only irreducibly singular</page><page sequence="5">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? 19 statement here is that the explosion followed the lighting of the match and that is not a causal statement. The matter most germane to my argument is Hume's view of production. He frequently talks of "cause or productive quality" (e.g., Treatise, I, iii, 14; p. 155. Page references to the Treatise are to the Everyman Edition, 1939), and he also says such things as "Here then is a passion placed betwixt two ideas, of which the one produces it and the other is produced by it" (Treatise, II, ii, 2; vol. II, p. 6). Just before the famous passage on causal efficacy he sets himself to enquire into "the efficacy of causes, or that quality which makes them to be followed by their effects" (I, iii, 14; p. I55). Then he says "I begin with observing that the terms of efficacy, agency, power, force, energy, necessity, connection and productive quality, are all nearly synonymous and therefore it is an absurdity to employ any of them in defining the rest. By this observation we reject at once all the vulgar definitions which philosophers have given of power and efficacy; and instead of searching for the ideas in these definitions, must look for it in the impressions from which it is originally derived" (I, iii, 14; p. 155). Hume is sometimes taken to be asserting here that the idea of cause does not involve the ideas of production and efficacy, and that we have in fact no idea of them. This is reinforced by statements later in section 14. However, even later he says "But as it is more probable that these expressions do here lose their true meaning by being wrong applied, than that they never have any meaning; it will be proper to bestow another con- sideration on this subject, to see if possibly we can discover the nature and origin of those ideas we annex to them" (p. i61). Finally he concludes that causal necessity is "an internal impression of the mind, or a determination to carry our thoughts from one object to another" and not anything in the conjoined objects themselves (pp. 162-3). Thus Hume does not intend to remove the ideas of efficacy, necessity, production, and so on, from the idea of cause; he merely objects that we cannot define "cause" in terms of production because a definition of "production" would be "the same with that of causation" and would give "a synony- mous term instead of a definition" (I, iii, 2; p. 8o). But what else can be expected of an explicit definition than the equating</page><page sequence="6">20 PETER ALEXANDER of synonymous expressions? In spite of appearances, I think that his real objection was that it is no use defining "cause" in terms of production because we do not understand production any better than we understand cause, so the definition would not produce enlightenment. It is necessary to define both in other terms; his analysis of cause is also intended to be an analysis of productive quality. Hume had already laid down the terms in which he would allow himself to understand; he would not accept any definition which was not based on impressions and their relations. By concentrating on the origins of the idea of cause he could, he thought, explain it in terms of basic experiences accessible to everyone, because he thought he had successfully circumscribed the limits of accessibility. The result appears to me to be unsatisfactory except as the development of a theory. It emerges that neither term means what philosophers sometimes, and plain men usually, take it to mean. When we say that one thing caused or produced another we do not normally mean merely, or always, that there is constant conjunction between things of those kinds, even along with an internal impression of the mind. In the process of definition Hume, in spite of his intentions, lost an essential part of the meaning of "cause", namely, the force of the idea of production, and succeeded at most in giving a test by which anyone could tell how to apply the term at least as well as anyone else. I contend that, in spite of Hume, we do understand cause and production, even if we find it difficult to give an account of them, and probably long before we are sure how to apply them to the more complex situations. It may be impossible to give explicit definitions of them; understanding may involve appreciating their relations to one another and to a cluster of other concepts which we acquire along with them. It is clear, even on Hume's analysis, that "a caused P" does not mean the same as "a. was followed by P"; on what grounds can we say that "A causes B" does not mean the same as "A is always followed by B"? In the first place, "A causes B" can be used to explain "A is always followed by B". It makes sense, in reply to someone who says "Isn't it odd that in our experience A is always followed by B" to say that it is not odd at all since</page><page sequence="7">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? 21 A and B are causally connected, and this is to say something more than that A always will be followed by B. We use the causal expression to make a distinction between constant con- junctions and causal sequences; even if it is mysterious how we tell the difference we do mean something different by these. In a similar way, "a was followed by P" can be explained, sometimes, by "a caused P" and this preserves a common sense similarity of meaning between "caused" and "causes". It makes sense to ask, when a has made P happen, whether a-things always make f-things happen, under those conditions or under any conditions. The strength of regularity views lies in the fact that it is very difficult to find examples of constant conjunction for which there is no causal explanation. Thus if A is invariably followed by B we take it that there will be some causal explanation; the fact that "A is invariably followed by B" and "A causes B" always appear to be true together tends to support the Humean supposition that they mean the same. It by no means follows. It makes perfectly good sense to say "Because A is invariably followed by B, probably A causes B" but only if we are giving a reason and not if we are giving a meaning. We may admit that the fact that A is always followed by B is evidence for A's causing B but then we cannot say that they mean the same, since if X is evidence for r then X and T cannot be identical. The meanings of "A causes B" and "a caused P" are given by the relations of these expressions to large numbers of other expressions more or less closely connected with them. Instead of saying "Heat causes rails to buckle" we can say "Heat makes rails buckle" or simply "Heat buckles rails". A partial explanation of these is given by "Heat expands rails, so they must bend if the gap between them is too small". These are also related to "Heat caused the rails to buckle", "Heat did that", "All the conditions were such that when the temperature rose the rails had to buckle" and "Because that happened, this happened". These are all in turn related to "I (He) made this happen" and "I (He) did this". Most importantly, I believe, these are also related to the verb "to make". We understand what it is to make something, for example, the figure of a man out of putty. When I claim to have done this my claim does not mean merely that certain</page><page sequence="8">22 PETER ALEXANDER actions of mine, described independently of the product, were followed by the appearance of the figure of a man, even along with the claim that such actions are always followed by such appearances. The action was one of making the figure of a man. It involved changing the shape of the putty into a new shape; it included the action of changing the shape of the putty. This was making something happen, that is, causing something. These are more general ways of describing what I did. In similar ways, "to cause" is related to large numbers of more specific verbs such as "to mould", "to squash", "to move", "to bend", "to break". And so on. I have only sketched the beginning of an in- vestigation of the meaning of "cause". When we have grasped all these liaisons we have come to a full understanding of the concept. Of course, things we observe have connections with all these ways of talking; they indicate occasions for their correct use, provide verifications and situations to be described in these ways. The good Humean does not, of course, deny that we do distinguish between constant conjunctions and causal se- quences; he is inclined to say that we ought not to do so because there is no test for the difference, no basis in experience for the distinction. However, saying that we can observe As and Bs but not the connexion between them involves the error of supposing that to verify a statement we must establish a one-one correspondence between the words of the sentence used and what we observe. As Peter Geach has said (Mental Acts, London, 1957, p. 41), "We must resist the perennial philosophical temptation to think that if a thought is to be true of reality, then it must copy it feature by feature like a map." The fact that we do make distinctions which the Humean account does not allow gives a prima facie reason for thinking that it has failed to elucidate our concept of cause. IV. REFINED REGULARITY VIEWS My objections to Hume's account may not hold against every version of the regularity view. In particular, the consequence that apparently singular causal statements are covertly general</page><page sequence="9">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL? 23 might be avoided by a refined view. I mention only the most determined and ingenious attempt I know to give a regularity account of singular causal statements which is closer to common sense. J. L. Mackie ("Causes and Conditions" in American Philosophical Quarterly, October, 1965) claims to show "how even a unique sequence can be directly recognized as causal" (p. 262). His account is long and complex but I shall summarize its main features, I hope without doing it any violence. In order to be justified in making a singular causal statement, "a caused P", we should have to know that a was an insufficient but necessary part of a condition which was itself unnecessary but sufficient for P, within a certain restricted causal field. (This whole condition Mackie calls an "inus" condition.) The idea of a causal field involves the way in which we describe the phenomena in question, which allows judgments of ir- relevance. It follows from these requirements that we must have made judgments about necessity and sufficiency and these involve non-material conditionals, respectively counter-factual and factual, which are disguised arguments having as their premisses simple factual universals. In establishing all this we use a complex form of elimination based on Mill's Method of Difference. It turns out that singular causal statements do not depend upon the repetition of the events or conditions they mention but only upon repetitions of other events or conditions which are described in the simple factual universals con- stituting the premisses of the arguments leading to the state- ments of necessity and sufficiency. Mackie stresses that when we make singular causal statements or statements of necessity and sufficiency we may not be in a position to specify, except in a "gappy" form, these factual universals, but we do mean to say that there is some set of such statements. It seems to me that Mackie's claim that this shows how even unique sequences can be directly recognized as causal is, in a sense, not fulfilled. It shows how a singular statement of the form "a caused P" can be recognized as causal independently of the corresponding causal law "A causes B" but it implies dependence upon universal statements which, on a regularity view, are indistinguishable from causal laws. Mackie himself says of his account ". . . the causal laws involved are no more than straightforward universal propositions" (p. 262, and see</page><page sequence="10">24 PETER ALEXANDER also pp. 254-5). Moreover, I believe that the delineation of the causal field already involves judgments of causal relevance. Thus it is, at best, in a very weak sense that the recognition of unique sequences as causal is direct. The important point is that it involves knowing already, through causal laws, what it is for something to cause something else. It therefore does not allow an account of the acquisition of the concept of cause which is any different from the unrefined Humean account. I think Mackie in effect denies any distinction between "causes)) or "produces", on the one hand, and "is constantly conjoined with", on the other. He does say "Singular causal statements are involved in almost every report of an experi- ment: doing such and such produced such and such an effect" (p. 262) but nevertheless his account has the result of reducing the notion of production to that of regular sequence. Thus, if there are objections to Hume's account on this score they hold also against Mackie's account. His account seems helpful as an account not of the meaning of singular causal statements but of the way in which we may decide when they are properly applied to cases which are not clear, that is, of the way in which we might justify the description of particular occurrences by singular causal state- ments. It is difficult to see how it could explain the acquisition of the concept of cause, involving as this does some notion of production. Moreover, casual observation strongly suggests that small children learn what it is to make something happen long before they learn general causal statements. It is a mistake to think that because the adult scientist is interested in applying the concept of cause to more complex situations than the child or the plain man, and so needs refined criteria, that his concept is therefore a different and more complex one. V. SOME ANTI-HUMEAN VIEWS Between the years 1923 and 1957, C. J. Ducasse has put forward various versions of a definition of "cause" which is intended to avoid reference to constant conjunction and repetition. It admittedly presents problems but nevertheless</page><page sequence="11">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? 25 many criticisms which have been levelled against it are ir- relevant because based on misunderstandings. What I want to seize on is his view that particular instances of causal con- nexion are perceived and not inferred and that this perception does not depend upon prior knowledge of causal laws. His brief definition is "the cause of the particular change K was such particular change C as alone occurred in the immediate environment of K immediately before" (Truth, Knowledge and Causation, London, 1968, p. 4) and he holds that this allows us, in favourable circumstances, to perceive a causal connexion. He says, "Hume's view that no connexion between a cause and its effect is objectively observable would be correct only under the assumption that a 'connexion' is an entity of the same sort as the terms themselves between which it holds, that is, for Hume and his followers, a sense impression. For it is true that neither a colour, nor an odour, not a sound, nor a taste, nor any other sense impression 'connecting' the cause and the effect is observable between them" (p. 8). Empirically discovered causal laws are, according to Ducasse, arrived at by induction from singular causal statements. An occurrence could be unique in the history of the universe and yet be, and be known to be, a case of causation (p. 27). William Dray, considering the use of the concept of cause in history (Laws and Explanation in History, Oxford, 1957) says "in many cases discovery of individual causal connexions precedes the formulation of causal laws, the laws . . . requiring prior knowledge of the particular cases, rather than the cases requiring support of the covering causal law" (p. io6). We might in practice arrive at the causal conclusion "Speed causes road accidents" by generalization from a number of particular diagnoses of the form "The cause of this accident was excessive speed". He says, "We should only advance to asserting the law in addition to the individual diagnoses if the same cause turned up repeatedly in the kind of investigation concerned" (p. 107). Richard Taylor (Action and Purpose, Eaglewood Cliffs, N.J., 1966) argues that the causal relation is primitive, unanalysable and an ultimate philosophical category and that singular causal statements based on observation state connections of fact. Everyone knows what causation is because he thinks of himself as an efficient cause (p. 21).</page><page sequence="12">26 PETER ALEXANDER Max Black ("Making Something Happen" in Determinism and Freedom in the Age of Modern Science, ed. Sidney Hook, N.Y., 1957) begins from what he says we all call "making something happen". He says "You are thirsty, but there is a glass of beer within easy reach; you stretch out your hand, bring the glass to your lips, and drink. Here is what I call a perfectly clear case of making something happen. When you brought the glass nearer, that was a perfect instance of what all of us call 'making something happen' " (p. 31). He contrasts this with another example, which is not a clear case. "On hearing the opening of this paper, a member of the audience leaves the room, to be found later in the nearest saloon. To establish that my remarks made him leave the room would require a specific investigation" (ibid.) Such an investigation would be pointless and out of place in connexion with the first example; there is no question whether or not the man in that case really did move the glass. There are, of course, large numbers of abnormal and problematic cases where we would not feel so sure of ourselves but Black urges that there are also many normal cases, such as the one he describes, of which we should have no hesitation in saying that someone had made something happen, for example, made a glass move. He takes such cases as paradigms for the application of the expression "making something happen" and that is to say that we treat them as standards, like the standard metre rod, to which we appeal in attempting to resolve doubtful cases. Given that we have the concept, as we clearly do, not all the cases can be abnormal or problematic although, of course, any given case may be. Like Ducasse, Black says that causal relations are observable, or rather that we can just see things making something happen; he says "The verifying situation is right before our eyes" (p. 41). When we pass from primitive uses to other uses "derived by resemblance, analogy and metaphorical extension" (p. 35), for example, in some scientific contexts, the paradigm case still helps to illuminate these and because they are derived from it they cannot throw doubt upon it. "This remains true no matter how much the original description of the situation might be augmented or elaborated by scientific explanation, provided only that the additional information did not conflict with the original assumption of 'normality'. A scientist might</page><page sequence="13">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL? 27 explain why the pressure of the fingers required the glass to change position without slipping through the hand; . . . But such accounts, informative as they might be, have no tendency to discredit the correctness of the use of the expression 'making something happen'. They could not do so because the descrip- tion of the paradigm case is complete. If the description left gaps to be filled by scientific data as yet unknown, none of us would be able to use the expression 'making something happen' correctly. The expression would be a blank check drawn on an uncertain future" (pp. 35-6). Finally, "to make something happen is to cause something to happen" (p. 36). Black next asks, "What is it about the clear case that we treat as relevant in using it as a standard of comparison?" and extracts a list of criteria (pp. 36-7). The list (where P = the person who moved the glass, O = the object moved, M = its motion and A = the action performed by the agent) is: I. What happened was made to happen by P; 2. What he made happen was a motion (M) of O; 3. P made this happen by doing something (A); 4. In doing A, P was acting freely; 5. A occurred throughout the time that M was oc- curring; 6. M would not have occurred unless A had occurred; 7. When A occurred, M had to occur. The reactions of the well-trained Humean to Black's account are likely to be immediate and predictable. He will object to the idea of cause being linked to that of a human agent acting freely; he is likely to say that we usually regard the cause as preceding the effect and not as cotemporal with it; he is likely to have difficulty in understanding the counter-factual (6) and the idea of necessity involved in 7 and to say that these lead us back to the idea of constant conjunction which this account is intended to avoid. It is important that Black stresses that his list is not intended to constitute the meaning of "making something happen" but rather the criteria, or some of them, for its application or, as he puts it later "presuppositions for the proper use of causal language, not the meanings of the assertions made by means of such language" (p. 41). The idea of making something happen is in some sense primitive but the listed criteria are 2</page><page sequence="14">28 PETER ALEXANDER often needed for deciding of a problematic case whether or not it is a case of making something happen. I think he means that the criteria are not all necessary conditions for the application of "making something happen", and he clearly does not think that the list is complete; but given a complete list, if that were possible, some selection from the list would be presupposed in applying the expression to various kinds of situation. Black also says that "the notion 'would not have happened unless' is as primitive and unproblematic as the notion 'making some- thing happen'. Both are applicable in the same circumstances, long before any question of scientific terminology arises" (p. 39). There is no need, here, to discuss other features of Black's view in detail. My purpose is not to defend, as a whole, any of the four views from which I have quoted but rather to draw suggestions from them for the more positive part of this paper. In the course of this I hope that in a roundabout way I shall meet some of the familiar objections to views of this sort. VI. LEARNING ABOUT CAUSES I have said that I do not think that any regularity analysis catches what we mean by "cause". In this section I wish to consider whether it is logically possible to acquire the concept of cause in such a way that we could make singular causal statements without depending upon causal laws. If it is logically possible then the claims of regularity views that we acquire the concept by the observation of constant conjunctions between things of certain kinds and that the meaning of "cause" essentially involves the idea of constant conjunction would be considerably weakened, along with any view which implies that causal laws are purely general. It is important to note that we may have a concept, and understand an expression, without having a complete set of criteria for applying it or refusing to apply it in any conceivable situation. The test for understanding an empirical expression is that we should be able to apply it rightly to some experienced situations and that we should be familiar with its relations to certain other expressions in our language, not that we should be able to apply it infallibly whenever it applies.</page><page sequence="15">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? 29 I wish to suggest that in fairly primitive experience I may just find myself making something happen and that when I have done that I have acquired our fundamental concept of cause. Of course, at this stage I will probably not be able to explain "cause", let alone define it. The philosopher who is not satisfied until he can give some sort of analysis of it, may think that an account of the acquisition of the concept does not take us very far; but one thing that seems clear to me is that no more must be put into the analysis of the concept than is necessarily involved in its acquisition. We must be careful, here, not to be misled by our language. The great generality of the expressions "making something happen" and "causing" might lead us to suppose that to have the concept of making something happen we should need to have had a great deal of experience of different kinds of happenings from which to generalize, as if we could not see what it is to make something happen without first seeing the need for a general way of talking about breaking something, or bending something, or moving something, or etc., etc. It looks as if we might have to experience many of these things and see that they had features in common which would allow "making something happen" to apply to all of them indifferently. But "making something happen" has a different sort of generality from, say, "mammal", which refers to certain specific charac- teristics observable in anything correctly so-called; there is not this kind of resemblance between, say, breaking a cup, infecting an organism with typhoid and driving someone to drink, which are all instances of making something happen. Yet to understand what any one of these things is is to under- stand what it is to make something happen and to be in a position to apply the expression to the others. To understand what it is to make something happen it is not necessary to know all the kinds of instances it has. Imagine me at a very early age in a great state of ignorance about events in the world around me. I am aware of objects moving and changing but I have not yet learnt what it is for something to make these things happen. I have enough linguistic experience to know that the same word can be applied to different situations and I have heard individual things referred to as being bent, broken, as moving, and so on. A</page><page sequence="16">30 PETER ALEXANDER cricket ball is stationary on the floor in front of me; I push it and it rolls away. I may notice by myself or as the result of a smile from a parent that I have done something, that what I have done has changed something else. I try to do it again and I have acquired the concept of making something happen; I am in a position to try to make something different happen. Most of us have watched a very young baby do something for the first time, seen its attention fixed by the result, seen it try to do it again and show signs of disappointment if it fails. But have I really discovered what it is to make something happen, to make the ball move? Have I not merely seen, as I have often seen before, one movement and then another? But the difference here is that I moved my hand and felt the pressure of my finger on the ball before it moved. I felt the difference between touching it and pushing it harder and harder and so, eventually, between touching it and making it move, and this difference was correlated with seeing it not moving and then seeing it moving. There is an experiential difference between seeing one thing merely following another and making something follow which gives some basis for distinguishing. Of course, there is a great deal more to be learnt about whether and how I can do it again and why I sometimes fail but these further questions presuppose possession of the concept. But did I find that I made the ball move? Is it not necessary to know that no other changes in the environment were responsible, that I and nothing else made the ball move? But to ask this question would be already to have the concept of making something happen. (Yet if I did not ask this question it is implausible to suppose that I would ever go on investigating such things and learning from experience.) To discover that changes of a certain sort are, or are not, responsible for changes of another sort I would have to understand what it is for something often or always to make something happen. I could not discover what it is for something not to make the ball move until I had the concept of something making it move; there would be nothing for me to notice. Suppose we say that all I need to know is that changes of certain sorts are not regularly followed by the ball's moving and that apart from my action only changes of those sorts</page><page sequence="17">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL? 31 occurred at the time. But this could not be evidence for my having made the ball move unless I already had the concept of something making it move. No amount of observation of constant conjunctions could lead me to the idea of my or anything else's making the ball move; what could lead me to it is something more and different in the way of experience. It may be said, however, that the baby might always be mistaken in thinking that he had made something happen, so he hasn't really acquired the concept. However, the baby can't always have been mistaken; there must be thousands of occasions on which he has pushed off his blanket or spat out his food or dropped his rattle, occasions which we would all admit as genuine examples of making something happen. Very well then, my opponent may say, there are many such occasions but there are also many others on which he is mistaken and he can't distinguish these so, still, he can't really have the concept. This does not matter. The baby is in a position to distinguish kicking off his blanket, something he has done and felt himself doing, from the passing of a car, something he has not done. To have the idea of making something happen he need only have the idea that he did it and that it would not have happened just like that unless he had done what he did. He may be mis- taken, sometimes, in identifying situations but there is a sense in which he knows what he is looking for. Suppose he has a pain every time he sees a car go past. Might he not think that he made the car go past? But why should he ? What is there to connect him with the car? What did he do? Even for adults, the last possibility we consider is that we are making something happen to something distant from us and with no obvious connexion with us, although we know about theories of action at a distance. Black takes the ideas of making something happen and "would not have happened unless" to be equally primitive and unproblematic; Taylor takes causality to be an ultimate philosophical category. I agree that the idea of making some- thing happen is at least primitive in the sense that irreducibly singular statements involving it describe observable oc- currences. By comparison, the idea of a kind of thing's being regularly followed by another kind of thing seems complex and sophisticated. As I have suggested, the idea of my making</page><page sequence="18">32 PETER ALEXANDER something happen may be got from certain experiences aided, no doubt, by linguistic experience of an elementary sort such as hearing people refer to things as being moved, broken, squashed, and so on. The idea of a kind of thing's being followed always by another kind of thing would appear to require wider experience of events, greater linguistic sophistica- tion and greater powers of abstract thought. "Always" pre- supposes "now" and "then", and "kind of thing" presupposes "thing". It is now important that I try to deal more fully than Black does with the transition from my making something happen to other things making something happen or, more specifically, from the application of the idea to situations involving human agents to its application to situations not involving them. This may perhaps best be approached by asking whether, if I am right, our concept of making something happen would be anthropomorphic and what we are to say about the wind blowing the trees and the waves tossing pebbles about. Black admits that on his account it may be anthropomorphic and says, "If this be anthropomorphism, we must make the best of it" since "a candid examination of causal language will show that our prototypes involve persons" (p. 37). He was developing his view within the context of a discussion of human freedom and so had a special reason for considering an account of causation that depended upon human agency. He goes on to argue that in different situations we may discard the criteria of the human agent, allowing the motion of an inanimate object to count as that which makes something happen but as he is not particularly concerned with this he, unfortunately, does not develop it. What is anthropomorphism and why is it wicked? Cause would be an anthropomorphic concept if it essentially involved the idea of human agency, given the way we apply it. We presumably frown on this because it gives a mistaken picture of some occurrences and commits us to statements which are clearly false. It is a mistake to suppose that when the wind blows the trees there is a human, or even a living, agency at work. A concept is objectionably anthropomorphic if, being applied to situations in which we suppose no human agency to be at work, it essentially involves the idea of human agency.</page><page sequence="19">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL? 33 The mere fact that its origins can be traced to situations involving human agency is not enough to make it objectionably anthropomorphic. It seems perfectly possible that we may acquire a concept in situations involving human agency and at the same time see that it can be applied to situations not involving human agency. Not all the circumstances of the original learning situation need be part of the concept acquired; a paradigm need not give the meaning of an expression but may just exhibit one of the situations to which it is properly applied. If we were taught to use "red" by being shown pillar-boxes we need not thereafter think that any red thing must ipso facto have a rectangular slot. I might get the idea of a force's being exerted by feeling what it is like to exert a force without supposing that the meaning of "exerting a force" involves that feeling. In moving something myself I could acquire the concept of making something move rather than the concept of my making something move. The concept of a person involves the ability to do different things; not all the things done by persons can only be done by persons. In learning what it is for a person to make something move I may be acquiring at the same time the concepts of a person doing different things and of different things making something move. Learning about making something move is not like learning about seeing something move: no experience tends to make me think of inanimate objects seeing things move; no experience suggests that only persons make things move. I have heard a very young child say "The hill makes me run" without anything in its speech or actions suggesting that the hill had human qualities. Most of our earliest experiences are such as to help us to keep separate the idea of a person and the idea of making something happen. Human agents are also patients. I am pushed and pulled and buffeted not only by my elders but also by inanimate objects. I learn very soon that there are pressures I cannot resist; as I crawl into the sea a wave bowls me over and I can do nothing to prevent it. In this situation the characteristics that make me a person are irrelevant, my powers of action are useless; in relation to the wave I am just a thing and not a person. I am no better than a pebble. I am in a position to see that when I make something move and feel</page><page sequence="20">34 PETER ALEXANDER the pressure on my hand, the fact that I exert the pressure and the feeling I have when I do so are unimportant in making something move, except, as we can see, as drawing my attention to it. In seeing what I am doing I also see what inanimate objects can do. Generalization sets in, and with it the re- cognition that human agency is inessential. The experience of my own inability to resist the wave enables me to think of necessary connexions between inanimate objects. Just as I can push something and make it move, so a wave can make me or a pebble move. I don't have to discover more about what "making something move" means; my ignorance is about such things as how much force it takes to move various things, whether the same amount always does for the same thing, when I can safely predict that I can make something move and when I can safely say what has made something move. It is here that repetition becomes important. Of course, I may make mistakes in applying the concept but it doesn't follow that I have not got it. Indeed, if I feel disappointment, having made something move and then failed to make another thing move what else can this indicate but the possession of the concept? As we grow older we become less sure of ourselves but this need not indicate that we become doubtful about the meaning of "making something happen". We understand it in the same way but we become interested in more complex situations and so less sure about when it is proper to apply the concept. We still have no real doubts about Black's "perfectly clear cases" which are before our eyes. They still serve as paradigms, if we admit that there may be many paradigm cases, and it still makes sense to say that these are what we call "making something happen". Black perhaps gives the wrong picture by comparing them with the standard metre rod, because we have no one standard to which everyone can and must refer. Nevertheless, each of us has within his reach a multitude of perfectly clear cases for his own use or to show others should the need arise. Anything that it is in my power to make happen will do. How do I know that it is of a relevantly similar kind to the earlier cases? The question does not arise; the mere fact that there is something I can do to an external object is enough; doing something to an external object just is making something happen. Any particular prediction may fail</page><page sequence="21">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL? 35 but if I can do anything at all I can show someone what it is to have made something happen. Having succeeded in drinking some beer I have made something happen and I would usually not allow anything to count against that. I would allow some- thing to count against it only if I had some reason for doing so and usually I have no such reason. It is because of the importance of these last considerations that I have not suggested that we acquire the concept originally from our early experiences of things making us move, which might seem a more promising way of avoiding anthropo- morphism. It seems to me that we might acquire a full-blooded concept of cause, involving the notion of production, in the way I have suggested. This might involve a number of different experiences but not repetitions of similar situations, that is, experience of constant conjunctions. Having the concept, we face problems when we ask, about complex events involving only inanimate objects, "What made that happen?" but these problems concern the criteria for applying the concept rather than the meaning of "making something happen". Scientists ask questions of this sort in particular circumstances and do not get involved in questions of meaning. The questions which philosophers are really concerned about are perhaps not questions of meaning either but rather questions about general criteria for the application of the concept, which are sometimes confused with questions about meanings or requests for definitions. The good empiricist will no doubt be worried by the im- plications of my view for observation. Can we, even in perfectly clear cases, observe things causing other things ? It is important to remember, as Black points out, that "cause" and "make happen" are schematic words of great generality. We are inclined to overlook this when we use expressions such as "a caused f" in discussions of causality. Whenever we give an instance we can replace "caused" by some more specific verb. For example, instead of "The falling slate caused the window to break" we can put something like "The falling slate broke the window". "Caused" and "made happen" stand for numbers of more specific verbs, such as "cut", 'broke", "made", "crushed", "melted", and so on. Because of this</page><page sequence="22">36 PETER ALEXANDER "cause" is more open-textured than these verbs and this is why it is more difficult, and perhaps impossible, to define it or to give general criteria for its application. This partly explains the endless arguments about how to define "cause". (Similarly, "fact", "event", "material object".) The schematic character of "cause" makes it appear plausible to deny that we can observe one thing causing another but it would surely be ridiculous to deny that we can sometimes see a slate break a window or a steam hammer crack a nut. Unless we could be sure of some such cases we could not be unsure of others. Indeed, to say this sort of thing is a normal way of speaking and, where it is proper to speak in this way, to talk of constant conjunctions would be mere philosophers' jargon and, besides, desperately uninteresting. To say that someone who swallowed arsenic died because death regularly follows the swallowing of arsenic would be a perverse use of "because". We are not so much interested in sequences as in consequences and we think these can be distinguished. I am inclined to conclude that singular causal statements can be used to describe observed occurrences without reliance on causal laws and that at least some causal laws may be arrived at by generalization from singular causal statements. It follows, I think, that causal laws need not be purely general since they may be, in part, about the observed occurrences which those singular causal statements describe. I am well aware that there are problems which I have been unable to mention here and, indeed, the subject now looks to me too large for a single paper, but I am reasonably confident that the problems are not insuperable.</page><page sequence="23">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? by Peter Alexander and Peter Downing II Peter Downing Mr. Alexander maintains that there are 'irreducibly singular' causal statements, and that from this it follows that causal laws need not be purely general. The view that there are irreducibly singular causal statements appears to commit Alexander to rejecting two theses: (i) that singular causal statements are analysable into statements containing specific generalizations, for example that a statement of the form 'a's having f caused a to have g' is analysable into statements containing specific generalizations of the form 'Everything which has f has g' or 'If anything had f it would have g' or 'Everything which has h and f has g' or 'If anything had h and f it would have g', etc. (2) That singular causal statements are analysable into statements containing incompletely specified generalizations, for example that a statement of the form 'a's having f caused a to have g' is analysable into statements containing generaliza- tions such as are contained in 'a has some property h, such that everything which has h and f has g', 'a has some property h, such that if anything had h and f it would have g', etc. That Alexander is committed to rejecting (2) as well as (I) emerges perhaps most clearly from section IV of his paper, where he criticizes Professor Mackie's analysis of causation. Mackie makes it clear that he is not committed to thesis (i) (American Philosophical Quarterly, October, 1965, p. 250) and Mackie's theory is indeed of type (2). It is thesis (2) that Alexander attributes to Hume when he says that according to Hume to say that the lighting of that match caused that explosion is to say that the explosion followed the lighting of the match and that, in such conditions, explosions invariably follow the lighting of matches. Thesis (I) is, I think, clearly false. If I say that Jones's 37</page><page sequence="24">38 PETER DOWNING pride resulted in his bankruptcy, I am not committed to the view that pride is always followed by bankruptcy, nor am I committed to specifying some factor F, present in this par- ticular situation, such that pride combined with F is always followed by bankruptcy. Thesis (2), however, is not easily refuted. The refutation of Hume's analysis of causal laws (which Alexander is concerned with in part of section III of his paper) does not affect thesis (2), since it leaves open the possibility of analysing causation in terms of statements which are not 'accidental' generalizations, but which are nevertheless general in form, for example, in terms of law-like conditionals of the form 'If anything had f it would have g'. In this con- nexion it is worth noting that Mackie leaves it to some extent open what meaning is to be assigned to 'sufficient condition' and 'necessary condition' in his analysis (p. 252). To refute thesis (2) it is not enough to show that we could, in principle or in practice, make singular causal statements or judgments without having accepted any causal law as true, since it might be replied to this that the mind has a natural tendency to generalize, at any rate to think in terms of incompletely specified generalizations. Moreover, it is quite consistent with (2) to hold that causal laws may be arrived at by generalization from singular causal statements. For example, even if one were to analyse 'a's havingf caused a to have g' as, say, 'a has some property h such that if anything had h andf it would have g', it would still be possible to allow that if on many occasions a thing's havingf causes it to have g this constitutes evidence for the generalization that whenever a thing has f this causes it to have g, this generalization being interpreted as 'Everything which has f has some property h such that if anything had h and f it would have g'. It might be thought that thesis (2) can be refuted by pointing out, as Alexander does, that 'in fairly primitive experience I may just find myself making something happen, and that when I have done that I have acquired our fundamental concept of cause', that 'there is an experiential difference between seeing one thing merely following another and making something follow', and so on. However, it seems to me that such arguments remain inconclusive until we consider what such 'findings' and 'experiences' amount to. For example, is</page><page sequence="25">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? 39 the experiential difference in question comparable with the experiental difference between hearing a high note and hearing a low note, or with the experiential difference between seeing that something is blue, and seeing that something is red? I shall return to this problem later. Alexander mentions, without dissenting from it, the view that the causal relation is primitive and unanalysable. He himself says that 'cause' may be indefinable and he appears to regard it as more important, for his purposes, to discuss the ways in which we acquire the notion of causation than to attempt an analysis of it. He seems to imply that attempts to analyse the causal relation arise from a confusion between questions about general criteria for its application, and questions about meaning, and he thinks that the possibility of substitutions such as that of (a) 'The falling slate broke the window' for (b) 'The falling slate caused the window to break' underlines a characteristic of the causal relation which makes it difficult and perhaps impossible to define. While agreeing with Alexander's rejection of the 'regularity' analysis of causation, I am inclined to think, in contrast to Alexander's view, that the possibility of substitutions such as that of (b) for (a) above suggests that an analysis may be possible. More- over, I think that analysis may provide a way of solving some of the problems raised in Alexander's paper. I have no space here to attempt an adequate analysis, and will therefore confine myself to making some suggestions as to what form such an analysis should take. It seems to me that in an analysis of causal statements it is necessary to utilize a certain kind of conditional statement such as is typically made by sentences like 'If Jones worked hard he would be promoted', 'If Smith left now he would catch his train', and so on. These statements are not necessarily 'counter-factual', nor do they have to be made by means of subjunctive conditional sentences (see John Watling, 'The Problem of contrary-to-fact Conditionals', Analysis, March, 1957, and M. R. Ayers 'Counterfactuals and Subjunctive Conditionals', Mind, July 1965). Their logic is not easy to formalize and empiricists have doubts about them, but I am inclined to agree with Alexander that 'one who is concerned to elucidate the meaning of causal statements is under no</page><page sequence="26">40 PETER DOWNING obligation to make things easier for the formal logician or the Humean empiricist'. We constantly speak and think in terms of such conditionals, and although their logic presents diffi- culties, it is not totally intractable. It is widely agreed that conditionals are non-truthfunctional, that they are not state- ments of logical necessity, and that, typically at any rate, they are neither necessarily true nor necessarily false, and it is fairly widely agreed (and in what follows I shall assume) that opposite conditionals of the form 'If p, q' and 'If p, not q', or 'If p, q', and 'If p, r' (where q and r are contraries) cannot both be true (I have argued for this in Mind, October, 1961). I am convinced that conditionals have a logic of their own, that they cannot be reduced to or 'justified' in terms of material implications, whether of the form 'p q' or '(x) (fx gx)', and that they cannot be explained away as being arguments rather than statements. I shall now investigate some of their logical characteristics, partly in order to provide some justi- fication for this conviction, but mainly in order to help establish the relevance of conditionals to the analysis of causation. I. The statements which in this paper I describe as 'con- ditionals' have a characteristic which might be described as 'strengthenability'. For example, we can strengthen the statement that if Jones left at six he would miss his train by adding 'whether or not he took a taxi'. This serves to contrast conditionals with material implications. Thus, 'If Jones left at six, whether or not he took a taxi he would miss his train' is equivalent to 'If Jones left at six and took a taxi he would miss his train, and if Jones left at six and did not take a taxi he would miss his train', and it seems clear that this statement entails but is not entailed by 'If Jones left at six he would miss his train'. In contrast '((p.q) D r).((p. e q) D r)' is equivalent to 'p D r', as a truth table will reveal. 2. Conditionals also differ from material implications in that general material implications related to them in a certain way do not entail them, thus: (i) A generalization of the form (x) (fx = gx) does not entail a conditional of the form 'If a had f it would have g'. For example, 'Everyone who takes arsenic dies of it' does not entail 'If Jones took arsenic he would die of it'. (ii) A generalization of the form (x) (xRa = gx) doesn't</page><page sequence="27">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL? 41 entail a conditional of the form 'If b had R to a, b would have g'. The characteristic of conditionals here illustrated enables one to distinguish them from certain other statements typically made by means of subjunctive conditional sentences. Thus on the ground that Bizet was a Frenchman we may say, 'If Verdi had been a compatriot of Bizet, Verdi would have been French', or, on the ground that Verdi was Italian, we may say, 'If Bizet had been a compatriot of Verdi, Bizet would have been Italian'. The detailed interpretation of sentences of this kind presents some difficulties, but I think that they can all be interpreted as making categorical and/or disjunctive statements. A further point about them is that they are always entailed by generalizations which are related to them in the way just illustrated. Thus the above two statements are entailed, respectively, by the statement that everyone who was a compatriot of Bizet was French, and the statement that everyone who was a compatriot of Verdi was Italian. For this reason they are to be distinguished from what I describe as 'conditionals'. In this connexion it is perhaps worth em- phasizing the possibility of certain ambiguities. Thus we might use the sentence 'If Jones had come to the meeting he would have voted for sanctions' in such a way that the statement made follows from the statement that everyone who came to the meeting voted for sanctions, especially if the sentence is interpreted as equivalent, say, to 'If Jones had been identical with one of those who came to the meeting he would have voted for sanctions' or to 'IfJones had had all the properties of one of those who came to the meeting he would have voted for sanctions', but we could also use the original sentence to make a statement which does not follow from the generalization, a statement such that we might admit that everyone who went to the meeting voted for sanctions, yet deny the truth of the statement and maintain that if Jones had gone to the meeting he (being Jones) would not have voted for sanctions. 3. Although opposite conditionals of the form 'If p, q' and 'If p, not q' are contraries, there is no such incompatibility between two conditionals of the form 'If p, q' and 'If not p, q'. For example, it is no doubt true both that if I now sneezed the sun would rise tomorrow, and that if I did not now sneeze the sun would rise tomorrow.</page><page sequence="28">42 PETER DOWNING 4. A related point is that conditionals do not in themselves entail that a causal connexion holds. A sentence of the form 'If, p, q' can, of course, be used to make a causal assertion, but it can also be used to assert a genuine conditional (distinct from a material implication) which does not involve causation as part of its meaning. For example, suppose Jones believes that whether or not he performed a certain ritual it would rain within the hour, a belief which certainly doesn't commit him to the belief that performing the ritual would cause the rain, he could quite correctly report a part of what he believes by saying 'If I performed the ritual it would rain within the hour'. Suppose now that Jones performs the ritual and it rains within the hour. He might now express the other part of what he believes by saying, 'If I hadn't performed the ritual it would have rained within the hour', but Smith, who is more super- stitious than Jones, might reply, 'No, if you hadn't performed the ritual it would not have rained within the hour'. If Jones's statements were material implications he would only need to draw Smith's attention to the fact that it rained within the hour to prove his point, yet surely Smith can accept the fact that it rained within the hour, yet reject the view that it would have rained within the hour if Jones had not performed the ritual. Since the antecedent of Jones's second assertion is false, the truth of the conditional assertion will not follow from the truth or falsity of its components, and he will have to resort to other means to defend his position. 5. Conditionals, as I have argued before (P.A.S., 2nd February I959) but on grounds different from those given below, are temporally asymmetrical in that, roughly, their antecedents must contain a reference to some time earlier than any time referred to in their consequents. I shall now put forward two sets of considerations in support of the weaker thesis that conditionals cannot be temporally 'backward looking', that is, roughly, that there cannot be conditionals whose consequents refer to some time earlier than any time referred to in their antecedents. (i) That there can be temporallyforward looking conditionals, that is, conditionals whose antecedents refer to some time earlier than any time referred to in their consequents, seems beyond dispute. Such conditionals can, for example, be deduced</page><page sequence="29">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? 43 from causal statements such as 'Rain this month would result in good crops next month'. But if opposite pairs of conditionals of the form 'If p, q' and 'If p, not q' are contraries, whereas pairs of conditionals of the form 'If p, q' and 'If not p, q' are compatible, it follows that we cannot deduce from a forward looking conditional a backward looking contrapositive. This suggests that forward looking conditionals may not have contra- positives, that they may involve a relation from antecedent to consequent such that the negation of their consequents cannot (logically) stand in this relation to the negations of their antecedents. But if this is the case it follows that there cannot be backward looking conditionals. (ii) Consider the following statements: i. If Jones left the house by 5-30 and took a taxi he would catch the 5.45 train. 2. If Jones either didn't leave the house by 5-30 or didn't take a taxi he would not catch the 5.45 train. 3. If Jones left the house by 5-30 and caught the 5-45 train he would have a drink in the buffet car at 6. 4. If Jones took a taxi and caught the 5.45 train he would not have a drink in the buffet car at 6. These statements certainly seem to be consistent. I and 2 present no difficulty, 4 could be true because if Jones took a taxi he wouldn't have enough money for a drink, 3 also seems acceptable, especially if we add the assumption that since Jones wrongly thinks the station to be only ten minutes' walk away, if he left the house by 5-30 he would not take a taxi. From this assumption and statement 2 it follows that the antecedents of 3 and 4 are false, but this doesn't affect the consistency of I to 4. Yet in I and 2 we have a conditional and its inverse. If backward looking conditionals are possible, a backward looking conditional of the form 'If not q, not p' must surely be deducible from 'If p, q and if not p, not q', but in that case we can argue as follows: (a) If Jones caught the 5.45 train he would have left the house by 5-30 (by I and 2), if Jones caught the 5.45 train having left the house by 5-30 he would have a drink in the buffet car at 6 (by 3), therefore if Jones caught the 5.45 train he would have a drink in the buffet car at 6.</page><page sequence="30">44 PETER DOWNING (b) If Jones caught the 5.45 train he would have taken a taxi (by I and 2), if Jones caught the 5.45 train having taken a taxi he would not have a drink in the buffet car at 6 (by 4), therefore if Jones caught the 5.45 train he would not have a drink in the buffet car at 6. Since opposite conditionals are contraries, the conclusion of (a) and the conclusion of (b) cannot both be true. Con- sequently the assumption that backward looking conditionals are possible has enabled us to deduce a contradiction from premisses which certainly seem to be consistent, by means of the seemingly valid principle " 'If p, q and if p and q, r' entails 'If p, r' ". If it were argued that something stronger than i and 2 is required to justify the deduction of a backward looking conditional these premisses could be strengthened in various ways, along the lines I indicated when describing characteristic I of conditionals. It seems, therefore, hard to escape the conclusion that there cannot be backward looking conditionals. Conditionals, as I have characterized them above, are, I think, suitable candidates for use in an analysis of causation. The two most obvious reasons for this are, perhaps, first, that because they are temporally forward looking (or at least cannot be backward looking) they make possible an approach to the analysis of causation which provides a clear and non- arbitrary answer to the question, 'Why cannot an effect precede its cause?', and secondly because their 'strengthen- ability' harmonizes with the way in which we often reason about causation. For example, we often back up an opinion to the effect that it was X and not Y that caused Z by asserting that whether or not Y had happened, if X had happened Z would have happened. Such a backing would be pointless if this assertion were not something stronger than 'If X had happened Z would have happened'. Because of characteristic 4 of conditionals, it will not do to analyse, for example, (a) 'Rain will make the grass grow' as (b) 'It will rain, and if it rained the grass would grow'. Some- thing stronger is needed. If we add the inverse of the conditional we get 'It will rain, and if it rained the grass would grow, and if it didn't rain the grass wouldn't grow', but (amongst other</page><page sequence="31">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL? 45 difficulties) this turns out to be too strong, since 'Rain will make the grass grow' is consistent with the possibility that if it didn't rain someone would use a sprinkler and the grass would grow just the same. It does seem, however, that (a) entails (b) and that an analysis of (a) might be provided by adding to (b) something involving the truth or falsity of certain relevant conditionals. I shall not pursue this problem further as I think it is now possible to consider what bearing this approach to the analysis of causation has on some of Alexander's suggestions. First, can we experience or observe causation? If some object changes from having some propertyf to having some contrary property g, I can observe the object and I can observe the change, and I can judge that the object's having f caused it to have g. It certainly seems that I can make such a judgment without having previously come to believe in some appropriate generalization. The judgment will very probably be the result of the observations made on that particular occasion, but it needn't be inferred from them. In fact it needn't be an in- ferential judgment at all. Nevertheless, in the sense of 'observe' in which I can observe the object, or in which I can observe the change, I surely cannot observe the causal relation between the object's havingf and its having g, a relation which, if I am right, involves a temporally asymmetrical conditional relation plus something further which, I have suggested, probably amounts to the truth or falsity of further conditionals. It may, of course, be perfectly correct English to say that I 'noticed', 'found', etc., that the object's having f caused it to have g, and, as Alexander says, I can find myself making something happen, I can see a slate break a window or a steam hammer crack a nut, and so on, but if such episodes are to be capable of being not just the cause but the occasion of my acquiring the concept of cause, they must involve something more than mere seeing or observing in the sense that I can see or observe an object or an occurrence. They must involve a thought. I must judge, come to believe, or notice that something is the case, or perhaps wonder whether something is the case. Moreover, the content of the thought must be that (or whether) a certain relation holds, that (or whether) the events which I observe are con- nected in a certain way.</page><page sequence="32">46 PETER DOWNING Does the necessity for this thought make it wrong to say that we experience causation? When one speaks of someone's observing or perceiving something, one is often describing what might be termed an 'empirical relation', that is, a relation between individuals such that it can, in principle, be truly said of these individuals, 'This is the same individual that existed previously' in a sense of 'same' which appears to be unanalys- able, or at any rate not analysable in terms of similarity, common origin, etc., and such that the relation could in principle hold between the individuals for a time, then cease to hold between them, then hold between them again, and so on. Suppose now we describe as an 'immediate experience' an experience which can be described in a manner not in- volving any empirical relation. As a definition this might be thought unsatisfactory, at any rate by a convinced Pheno- menalist, on the ground that we cannot understand what an experience is without understanding what an immediate experience is, but at least it seems to provide a way of dis- tinguishing experiences which might be described by phrases such as 'being in pain', 'having a headache', 'hearing a sound', 'having a vision', from other experiences described as 'seeing a tree', etc. If we use the phrase 'immediate experience' in this way, it seems that a judgment of immediate experience, for example the judgment that someone is in pain, will not involve conditionals, but as soon as one examines judgments about experience in a wider sense of 'experience', the question whether they involve conditionals arises. Some Phenomenalists would argue that judgments about trees, tables, etc., involve conditionals, but this does not concern us. I have argued, however, that causal judgments do involve conditionals. Most of such judgments are about the physical world, but even if I judge, say, that my hearing a sound caused me to have a headache, I am judging not merely that certain immediate experiences have occurred or are occurring, but that a relation holds between them, a relation which involves conditional connexions. Hume does not allow for such conditional con- nexions. That he suspected that something had gone wrong may perhaps be inferred from the passage 'it is evident that whenever we infer the continued existence of the objects of sense from their coherence, and the frequency of their union,</page><page sequence="33">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? 47 it is in order to bestow on the objects a greater regularity than what is observed in our mere perceptions' (Treatise, Part IV, Section II). In my view, Hume ought to have seen similar difficulties in his account of causation, but at least he was right if he suspected that we sometimes think in terms of relations which in some sense are not observed. If an 'experience' which is the occasion of someone's acquiring the concept of cause must involve a conditional thought, it is open to someone who opposes the view that there are 'irreducibly singular' causal statements to argue that conditional statements are analysable into statements con- taining, say, incompletely specified general conditionals. Thus the fact that we use words like 'see', 'find', 'observe', etc., in causal contexts does not refute thesis (2). On the view of causation which I have sketched it certainly seems possible to move from a set of singular causal judgments of the form 'a's having f caused it to have g', 'b's having f caused it to have g', and so on, to the generalization 'Whenever a thing has f this causes it to have g', but on this view of causation it is far from certain that such a generalization ought to be classified as a causal law. A generalization of this form is not a conditional, hence one cannot in the case of some in- dividual c deduce from the generalization that if c had f this would cause it to have g, but if even singular causal statements involve conditionals, it seems reasonable to stipulate that anything which is to count as a causal law should have the same character. Consequently, it may be appropriate to accept as a causal law a statement of some such form as 'if anything had f this would cause it to have g', but it seems necessary to reject the weaker 'accidental' generalization mentioned above. Thus, the move from singular causal statements to causal laws seems to involve something more than straightforward generalization. A final difficulty. The principle of exportation ('r, and if r and p, q' entails 'If p, q') does not in general apply to con- ditionals, since given the truth of a statement of the form 'r, and if r and p, q', it may nevertheless be true that if p, not r and if p and not r, not q, from which can be deduced 'if p, not q', and hence the falsity of 'if p, q', but if I am right about the temporal asymmetry of the conditional relation, there</page><page sequence="34">48 PETER DOWNING seems to be no good reason against accepting a modified version of the principle of exportation which contains the additional stipulation that r should refer, say, only to times earlier than any times referred to in p. Such a principle har- monizes with the use of conditionals in the analysis of causation, since we often seem to hold beliefs to the effect that because and only because certain things have already happened, if some further thing were to happen it would have a certain effect. But now how are we to interpret 'If anything had f this would cause it to have g'? If it is to be analysed along the same lines as singular causal statements it will amount to the con- ditional 'If anything had f it would have g' plus some further stipulation involving the truth or falsity of certain conditionals. But if the modified principle of exportation is applicable the conditional in this analysis will be entailed by 'For any given time there is some condition C obtaining prior to that time such that if C obtained prior to that time and something had f at that time that thing would have g', and it seems probable that 'If anything had f this would cause it to have g' will also be entailed by something of the form 'For any given time there is some condition C obtaining prior to that time such that . . . etc'. A possible objection to this analysis is that it allows a law to be true 'by accident', to depend on something that only happens to be the case, and which might, conceivably, be altered by some trivial event such as a click of the fingers of a very special kind. From the fact that for any given time there is a condition C obtaining prior to that time such that... etc., it follows that no such trivial event ever has taken place or ever will take place, but it might be true that if such an event were to occur no such condition as C would obtain. This difficulty could perhaps be met by stipulating that it is impossible, in some very strong sense, that at any time there should not obtain such a condition as C. If such a stipulation is required in any causal law, this gives added point to my suggestion that the move from singular causal statements to causal laws involves something more than straightforward generalization. It also has the effect that in 'It is a causal law that if anything had f it would have g', a relation is involved</page><page sequence="35">ARE CAUSAL LAWS PURELY GENERAL ? 49 between a thing's havingf and its having g which differs from that involved in a singular causal statement of the form 'a's havingf caused a to have g'.</page></plain_text>
