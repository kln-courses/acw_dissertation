<plain_text><page sequence="1">something to interest every biologist, not only for plant pathologists, but also for specialists in such related sciences as genetics, physiology, and biochemistry; and indeed, there is much for young students of biology. The book has an important place in the literature of plant pathology and of other biological sciences. Carefully, and to a degree philosophically, it de- velops the history of plant pathology and projects its future. The book is in ten parts. Each part is devoted to a major division of the science. Most of the book-parts two through ten-contains the papers pre- sented before the nine symposia of the Anniversary meeting. There are six papers on physiology, seven on genet- ics, seven on fungicides and the chem- istry of fungicides, six on fungi, five on nematology, eight on the structure and the multiplication of viruses, and five on epidemiology. The authors of these papers are among the most distinguished in their own fields. For example, G. J. M. van der Kerk, of the Institute for Organic Chemistry, The Netherlands, con- tributes a paper on the "Chemical Structure and Fungicidal Activity of Dithiocarbamic Acid Derivatives," and Gerhard Schramm, of the Max Planck Institute for Virus Research, Germany, discusses "The Role of the Nucleic Acid in the Infection with Tobacco Mosaic Virus." It is significant that these two con- tributors came from foreign lands. Twenty-one of the 44 papers included in the symposia were presented by scientists brought here from England, Australia, South Africa, Germany, The Netherlands, Honduras, Mexico, and Canada. Part One of the Golden Jubilee vol- ume contains the seven major ad- dresses concerned with the history and development of plant pathology. Again, the prestige of the authors and the quality of their papers are outstanding. E. C. Stakman of the University of Minnesota relates plant pathology to the world's scientific and social development; John A. Stevenson of the United States Department of Agriculture traces the development of the science in North America; and J. G. Harrar of the Rockefeller Foun- dation discusses an international ap- proach to the study and control of plant diseases. Other contributors to this section are S. E. A. McCallan and George L. McNew of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Re- search, J. C. Walker of the University of Wisconsin, and James G. Horsfall of the Connecticut Agricultural Ex- periment Station. All in all, "Plant Pathology" reflects much credit on the various commit- tees of the Society that were respon- sible for the presentation and publi- cation of these papers, the contents of which point to the significant role of biological sciences in the future of mankind. The editors and publisher should be complimented on the production of this book which not only is very read- able but also is handsomely bound in gold. Paul R. Miller, Crops Research Division, U. S.

Were an ichthyologist to see the title of this handsome book before he saw the volume itself, there is a good chance that he would consider it no further. Obviously not even a work many times this size could treat ex- haustively with all tropical fishes, let alone those known to be suited for en- joyment in aquaria. Nevertheless, the choice and extent of the information included in this substantial volume are most satisfying, even to a pro- fessional fish biologist. The offering is furthermore greatly enriched by more than three hundred photographs, (by Brian Barrett) including more than a hundred excellently reproduced in color. The value of the illustrations is strongly enhanced by the prevalent inclusion of both sexes, with their careful designation. In capsule form, these plates offer one of the richest displays of sexual dimorphism in the animal world. Nearly a third of "All about tropical fish" is an aquarist's vade mecum. Ob- vious care was taken, however, not only to provide instructions for build- ing, setting up, and maintaining aquaria, but also to creating under- standing of an aquarium as an eco- system. Indeed, the first thirteen chap- ters are a skilful digest of information on the physiological ecology of fishes and the manipulation of an aquarium environment to meet the needs of finny inhabitants chosen for it. Chapter titles encompass the follow- ing subjects: choice, setting, and maintenance of aquaria; aquarium limnology; dietetics of aquarium fishes; enemies, diseases, and humane treatment of animals; aquatic plants; biology of fishes; freshwater tropical aquarium fishes of more than twenty families; miscellaneous tropical ma- rines. The chapter on "Kindness and cruel- ties" is really quaint in its naivete, although to some readers it may be annoyingly anthropomorphic. For example, "bullies abound in the fish world, as they do elsewhere" and "few aquarists realize the terror instilled into their pets by unskilled catching." Disposal of aquarium fish by flushing them down the toilet is regarded as "extremely cruel"!. Although this work was obviously aimed at aquarists, it contains much of value for the student and the re- searcher in ichthyology as well as for teachers of ichthyology and behavioral biology. Considering the profusion of fishes (estimates of species numbers go as high as 40,000), relatively little information exists concerning most of them. Exceptions to this are most common among the food and game species and, as the present work so ably demonstrates, in the many aquarium kinds. In this book, there is a wealth of comparative, guideline information on such diverse subjects as courtship, nurture in relation to fecundity, gestation period, territori- ality, genetics, change of habits with life history stage, principles of ani- mal coloration (including sexual dichromatism), thermal and chemical preferenda, and space and nutritional requirements. It is a worthy addition to a field of literature long dominated in the English language by the works of Innes (e.g., "Exotic Aquarium Fishes"), and Stoye ("Tropical Fishes for the Home Their Care and Propa- gation"). Much of the observational and experimental data included are firsthand experiences and are addi- tions in fact to the knowledge of the groups represented. K. F.

(1959) $5.50. *Function of the Human Body. AR- THUR C. GUYTON. 584 pp., illus. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadel- phia, Pa. (1959). These two college texts represent a field of biology teaching which on the secondary school level has been usurped by the non-biology oriented teacher, and the same trend is now appearing in the colleges. The Turner book is a standard col- lege health text of long standing in its latest revision. There is still an emphasis on human anatomy with some physiology included. Each chap- ter seems to begin with an anatomical treatment followed by its health as- pects. There is an interesting appen- dix explaining common prefixes and suffixes found in medicine. Also, there is a long and extensive treatment of common diseases included as an appendix. AIBS Bulletin * April 1960 47</page><page sequence="2">The Guyton book is a new human physiology text for college students who are taking the course as a service offering for a variety of curricula. Diagrams are quite excellent. Chem- istry background is not assumed, and the effort made to interpret the chem- istry of human physiology to such students is very well done. There is an easy, readable style with an emphasis on human physiological problems of great interest to college students. However, this seems to be a time when health books should assume a reasonable anatomical knowledge by the time the student reaches college. One of the telling criticisms made of health courses is the repetitiveness of much of the material included in such a course. One is obviously anatomy. While there is a health aspect dis- cussed for each body system, a great deal of the chapters in the Turner work is devoted to anatomy. Safety is confined to one chapter. There is no discrete treatment of physical growth where the research is proving to be of significance and interest to the student. The physiology text has taken up a great many malfunctions of bodily processes in order to better explain the normal. Homeostasis is a running theme. Of course, the college health course and the human physiology course for those students not bound for research are different courses, yet it is apparent in many colleges these are taken for the same reasons. Per- haps the time is now to establish a course with health overtones but with a solid physiological basis such as found in the Guyton text. I would like to see the text which combines the features of both these books for the student majoring in physical educa- tion, teaching, and related science fields of engineering, hygienists, etc. The material and treatment in both of these books would be a good place to begin.

(1959). $10.95. This is the third edition of a book that was published thirty years ago by the senior author. Many American biologists have used this book as a source of correlation procedures, pos- sibly because of its title and avail- ability. This I believe was a very unfortunate event which should be rectified by the appearance of other books on the subject. Throughout the book the authors have utilized exam- ples from the business and economic fields, neglected the associated theory, used terminology that does not con- form with current practice, made in- correct statements, and all in all have in the reviewer's opinion complicated or oversimplified the subject of cor- relation and regression analysis. Some of these objectives from a biologist's point-of-view may be justified by con- cluding that the book was written by economists and for economists with a very limited background in mathe- matics and statistics. Although the authors admit the omission and commission of some of the above items to which the reviewer objects, one wonders whether or not there is a justification for such a book as described by the authors: "This book is not intended to cover the entire field of statistics, but rather, as its name indicates, that part of the field which is concerned with studying the relations between variables . . . "No attempt is made in the body of the text to present the mathe- matical theory on which the art of statistical analysis is based. In- stead, the aim throughout has been to show how the various methods may be employed in practical re- search work, what their limitations are, and what the results really mean. Only the simplest of alge- braic statements have been em- ployed, and the practical procedure for each operation has been worked out step by step. It is believed that the material will be readily compre- hensible to anyone who has had courses in elementary algebra." By such a procedure the authors dis- cuss: introductory concepts, simple linear and curvilinear regression, mul- tiple linear and curvilinear regres- sion, significance of regression and cor- relation results, miscellaneous topics and the "uses and philosophy of cor- relation and regression analysis." I feel quite sure that readers with a background in elementary algebra will be completely frustrated when read- ing this book while research workers, who should have inquisitive minds, will have the same feeling as a result of omission of at least simplified as- pects of the theory. Fisher's and Stu- dent's papers of the twenties are pre- sented as though they are something new, for the authors state, "During the last two decades, the English statisticians 'Student' and R. A. Fisher have been developing more exact methods of judging the reliability of conclusions, partic- ularly where those conclusions in- volve correlation or are based on small samples. These new methods have as yet received but little recog- nition from American statisticians (reviewer's italics)." I feel quite sure that there is not one statistician in this country who would agree with this statement. Any- one familiar with the fitting of a line to data by the method of least squares will realize that normal assumptions are involved only when conducting a test significance or establishing con- fidence limits for a parameter. Yet, the authors state early in the book (page 62), "The method by which this line is fitted rests upon the assumption that the scatter of the individual ob- servations around the fitted line will approximate a normal distribution." They continually call the estimate of the error variance, e.g., s2y.x. the "standard error of estimate" and fail to mention that the fitted regression can be used to estimate various para- meters, each with its own standard error. If the dependent variate is zero when all the independent variates are zero, the authors state that the fitted line must go through the origin. This is a very poor procedure if one desires a best least squares fit to his data. Throughout the book they use the cumbersome procedure of using a divisor of n instead of n-1 when computing an estimate of the standard deviation and consequently must cor- rect for this deviation from the ac- cepted practice by appropriate adjustments on various formulas throughout the book. Simple algebraic proofs or diagra- matic explanations of the theory are omitted. Emphasis is placed on the presentation of machine calculation formulas and the omission of the basic formulas from which they were de- rived. Consequently, the equations have little meaning to the reader who is interested in understanding corre- lation and regression analysis. The reviewer still believes that the two best books on regression analysis are those of Quenouille (1952. Asso- ciated Measurements. Academic Press, N. Y., N. Y.) and Williams (1959. Regression Analysis. John Wiley and Sons, Inc. N. Y., N. Y.) Although both books serve various purposes, I believe that Quenouille's book will best serve the needs of biologists. However, the biologist with a poor facility for mathematics will not un- derstand either. Irrespective of what the reviewer thinks of this book, Ezekiel and Fox should be given credit for attempting to present this material to non- statisticians and their presentation should help to improve the next book on this subject.
