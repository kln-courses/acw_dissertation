<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Awake ye muses nine": Emily Dickinson's Prototype Poem LUCY BRASHEAR U PON EXAMINING A LETTER Emily Dickinson wrote her friend Abiah Root in 1850, Richard Chase concluded that by age twenty, Dickinson had discovered the themes which formed the basis of her poetry.' In March of this same year Dickinson sent a verse valentine to Elbridge Bowdoin, a young lawyer in her father's law office. This poem, beginning "Awake ye muses nine," has been customarily described as youthful merriment and considered representative of the traditional cult of sentiment associated with comic valentines of mid-nineteenth century New England.2 While Vivian Pollak does not refute the poem's traditional conventionality, in a recent study she analyzes it as a burlesque sermon.3 In neither interpretation, however, has Dickinson's earliest extant poem been examined as a prototype, which, like her letter to Abiah Root, introduces the themes of her mature work. "Awake ye muses nine" consists of twenty hexameter couplets, urging Bowdoin to choose a marriage partner from six young women, five of whom Thomas Johnson identifies as friends of Dickinson.4 According to Johnson, the sixth woman, distingushed by her "curling hair," is the poet herself. Written fully eight years before she started collecting her poems into packets and at least twelve before her burst of creative productivity, this valentine is a remarkable example of apprenticeship work. In its lines the form, imagery, and themes of her mature work are embryonically preserved. Moreover, since Dickinson includes herself, it provides an opportunity to consider this enigmatic poet as she may have perceived her world and her position in it as a young artist as well as a young woman. Thomas Higginson's criticism of Dickinson's measures as "spasmodic" (L 265)5 is unwarranted in respect to "Awake ye muses nine." Its Alexandrine couplets, sharply bisected by dominant caesuras, superficially suggest the decorum of neoclassic poetry. In the body of the poem the majority of lines are divided into almost equal halves: the first half composed of seven syllables, and the second, of six. Acutely sensitive to the subtleties of versification, Dickin- son metrically separates the mock heroic invocation from the body of the poem by shifting to internal as well as end rhyme and by omitting the interior redundant syllable. In this way she creates two lines composed of four equal parts: "Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine, / Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!" Typical of the poet's later style, trisyllabic or</page><page sequence="2">SAB 91 inverted feet are frequently substituted for the prevailing iambs. Although this poem is listed first in the Dickinson canon, it reveals an artistic maturation already well in process. In the popular "Sic transit gloria mundi" valentine written two years later (P 3), Dickinson dispenses forever with the appearance of hexameters, but not their sound, by writing them in the "common particular meter" of hym- nology, a pattern distinguished by alternating lines of seven and six syllables, incorporating the abcb rhyme scheme. In Dickinson's verse letter to her brother Austin, one of the five extant poems presumed to be written prior to 1858, she reveals further experimentation. Whether by chance or design, "There is another sky" (P 2) is an irregular sonnet, composed primarily of three-stress lines. This unusual sonnet letter is particularly notable for its venture into slant rhyme, a poetic pattern already anticipated in the "drum/ home" concluding couplet of the first valentine. Despite an absence of poems charting Dickinson's poetic evolution during these years, she was gradually moving towards the development of the pattern which became her metrical staple, the hymnal "common meter," composed of lines of alternating eight and six syllables, displaying both full and approximate rhymes. Thus, Dickinson's first valentine, as well as her second, acknowledges her as a painstaking artist, skilled in the techniques of conventional rhyme and meter.6 Nonetheless, the syllable and rhyme deviations in the remaining three poems of this period suggest that she was feeling her way cautiously in search of her own poetic idiom. Although Thomas Ford concludes that Emily Dickinson discovered her metrical staple "almost by accident,"7 these early poems indicate that their meter was not so much an "accident" as a result of conscious craft. In addition to disclosing Dickinson's initial attention to conventional metrics, "Awake ye muses nine" also records certain preferred rhetorical characteristics. Brita Lindberg-Seyersted analyzes her syntactic patterns, such as parallelism, balance, and repetition.8 The 1850 valentine exemplifies these techniques as well as certain rhetorical idiosyncrasies, which have become the rubric of Dickinson's poetry, for example, the various ways she implies ambiguity (Seyersted, 234-252). The confusing negation of the line "None cannot find who seeketh" anticipates the poet's indulgence in riddles just as another line "Who will not serve the sovreign, be hanged on fatal tree" denotes an early predisposition for the subjunctive. Other characteristics are also present, the puzzling hyphen for one. Re- gional language illustrated in the phrase "a deal of sad reflection" is quaintly coupled with such poetic diction as damsel, swain, and bower. Strangest of all, however, is not a Dickinsonian commission, but rather the curious omission of her favorite word, the fictive I. The solution to this conspicuous absence,</page><page sequence="3">92 Lucy Brashear however, may well lie in the biographical nature of the poem itself: to intensify the riddle of the sixth young woman, Dickinson may have con- sciously withheld direct reference to herself. Just as the form of "Awake ye muses nine" demonstrates Dickinson's meticulous workmanship, the imagery also underscores a similar precision. Three distinct groups, representing religion, nature, and mankind, celebrate the universal desire for all things to seek union: Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain, For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain. All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air, God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair! In Dickinson's cosmic view of "this terrestial [sic], ball," metaphorically "Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true." As a backdrop to the prevailing theme of marriage, the speaker parodies the Biblical story of the Creation. Rather than emphasize the making of the universe, the speaker stresses the union of Adam and Eve: The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one, Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun .... The forbidden tree of knowledge becomes the tree of marriage and to refuse its fruit-one of the "Six true, and comely maidens"-is to disobey God and "be hanged on fatal tree." In addition to the Genesis references, other Biblical allusions are also given a new context to reinforce the theme of marriage. The speaker reminds the young man that "None cannot find who seeketh" and cautions, "thou reap'st what thou hast sown . . . Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see .. . Although Pollak has traced the sources of the Biblical imagery and argues their parodic intent (70), these images suggest another and more serious level of interpretation-Dickinson's personal religious dilemmas. In a comic poem she conceals her inward anguish to accept without reservation the religious orthodoxy embraced by her family and friends. According to Northrop Frye, "She did not want to repudiate her faith but to struggle with it,"9 a tension which Dickinson intimates allegorically in "Awake ye muses nine." Submis- sion to Christian orthodoxy will be rewarded: "The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be"; and religious apostasy will be punished: "Who will not serve the sovreign, be hanged on fatal tree." Not only the Biblical Adam and Eve obey God's injunction to marry, but the world of nature also hastens to comply: The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives, And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;</page><page sequence="4">SAB 93 The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won, The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon, Their spirits meet together, they make them solemn vows .... Both nature and religious imagery also blend to describe metaphorically the union of human beings. The young man is advised to "Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb, / And seize the one thou lovest .. ." After he has made his choice, he must "give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower .. ." According to the Dickinson concordance, certain of these nature terms-flower, wind, air, earth, moon, jewel, and bird-are among her most consistently used vocabulary. Furthermore, these terms occur in greater frequency than their numerical incidence would suggest. For example, in her later poems the jewel image appears in several variations, agates, diamonds, opals, and sapphires, and the bird image as robins, hummingbirds, sparrows, and crows. Similarly, the flower and tree images also become distinguished by specific nomenclature. Significantly, only the bee, Dickinson's exalted male insect, is granted his own identity. Although Dickinson's world of nature is separate from that of mankind, frequently she uses personified creatures of nature to reveal her particular insights of human activity. In "Awake ye muses nine" the bee and flower images most clearly symbolize Dickinson's concept of marriage. Her ravisher bee courts the flower, an image which Albert Gelpi believes is the "emblem of her yearning to be delivered up to the domination of a Master ... ."10 In Dickinson's valentine the young man is told to "seize" the one he loves and give her, if she so desires, a flower, an image which appears on three occasions in this early poem. Time, another familiar Dickinson image, is presented as part of nature, one of the "things" that "go a courting": "Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide." According to Clark Griffith, Dickinson harbored a "neurotic obsession with temporality," which he called the "chief obsession of her poetry.""1 In "Awake ye muses nine" this preoccupation with time is unwittingly disclosed when the speaker asks the young man, "Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long," and advises him, "nor care for space, or time," an admonition which includes yet another preferred Dickinson image- space. Although the word space anticipates Dickinson's fascination with the image of circumference, this early valentine does not indicate the limitations she later placed on her own spatial environment. Written before she began to narrow the borders of circumference and compartmentalize its interior zone, the youthful Dickinson admits of no limiting barriers to impede the young suitor.</page><page sequence="5">94 Lucy Brashear After illustrating the virtue of marriage by citing precedents from both religion and nature, the speaker moves to the human realm and directly challenges the young man: Now to the application, to the reading of the roll, To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul: Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone, Wilt have no kind companion .... At this point Dickinson writes herself into the poem, not as observer, but as participant, one of the six maidens "sitting upon the tree." In Dickinson's happy version of the Fall of man, these maidens are metaphors of desirable fruit, put there especially for the young man to seize in accordance with God's commandment. Although five of the young women are identified by name- Sarah, Eliza, Emeline, Harriet, and Susan-Dickinson coyly describes herself as "she with curling hair." In a letter to her "preceptor" Higginson in 1862, Dickinson describes her hair as "bold, like the Chestnut Bur" (L 268), a physical attribute she evidently considered an appropriate clue to the riddle of the sixth young woman. In this same letter she also pictures herself as "small, like the Wren." This belief in her own insignificance, firmly entrenched by 1862, is but hinted at in the 1850 valentine: "The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small." Because of these biographical details, Dickinson's first extant poem provides a reference point from which to examine Dickinson herself. For example, the pageant imagery of her mature poetry has contributed to the picture of the poet as a voyeur, who watched life pass outside her window.12 In this poem, however, the speaker bids the young man select a maiden and then "bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum." Evidently at this time Dickinson saw herself as part of the parade, perhaps even the principal character. Eye imagery, another recurring Dickinson subject and one closely associated with the role of spectator, is also introduced. Although Dickinson described her eyes to Higginson as the "Sherry in the Glass, that the Guest leaves" (L 268), she was particularly concerned with the health of her eyes, not their beauty. Nonetheless, the conjunction of eyes and blindness as early as 1850 is unexpected. When the young man appears indifferent to the six maidens, the speaker warns him, "Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see." Despite the Biblical overtones, with uncanny prescience Dickinson ascribes to the young man an eye malady similar to the one which afflicted her in 1863-64 (Sewall, 606-607n). Two of Dickinson's most celebrated images-father and home-have elicited increasing speculation. Of the two, the figure of the father is the more complex since he is frequently described equivocally as both human and divine, illustrated in the first two words of the poem beginning "Papa above."</page><page sequence="6">SAB 95 Although "Awake ye muses nine" is organized into three distinct imagistic groups-religious, natural, and human-the father figure is neither presented in lines referring to God nor in those describing mankind but included among the images of nature. Along with the courtship of the bee and flower, the wind and branches, and the wave and moon, the speaker reminds us, almost in the form of a commandment, that "the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son." Illogically placed as this line may be, the idea of a father-dominated community is one so intrinsic to Dickinson's poetry that it is not surprising to find it is her first poem. Griffith describes Dickinson's father as the "supreme master in a father-dominated household" and compares the father image to her concept of God (280-281). Frye theorizes that "Emily Dickinson seemed to need in her life an older man to act as her 'preceptor' or 'master' " (194). Although Dickinson illustrates both these attitudes in "Awake ye muses nine," her disclosure that the father is obligated to insure the marriage of his son is a minute point but one worth noting. Either as anthropomorphic God or as human parent, the father assumes the marital well being of his son; whereas the daughter, who is pictured as one of several fruit on the tree of marriage, waits in suspended expectation, recommended soley by her "curling hair." If, as Griffith suggests, Dickinson came to believe that "her father failed Emily Dickinson" (167) and that eventually "God failed Emily Dickinson" also (168), the germ of this notion appears in her earliest poem. The second of Dickinson's notable images, the home, appears conspicuously as the last word of the poem. The young man is advised to "bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!" In a study of Dickinson's concept of this image, Jean Mudge concludes that while the word home may describe an actual building, it can refer "simultaneously to something much more, usually to a beloved, security, fulfillment, immortality, a state of peace or rest ... ."13 Although Mudge is speaking in general terms, all of these meanings are embodied in Dickinson's first poetic use of this image. Since the word home is syntactically in apposition to the word glory, Dickinson's valentine ends on a note of surprise. While the speaker's advice to the young man to "bid the world Goodmorrow" suggests the beginning of a temporal life, the concluding mandate to "go to glory home" supposes a heavenly abode. Thus, the theme of immortality, Dickinson's "flood subject," is implicitly manifest in her earliest poem. Of even more consequence, however, the counterpoising of human and heavenly dwellings in a comic valentine is a disquieting augury as it foreshadows Dickinson's compulsive retreat into her Amherst home in prepa- ration for her celestial home. Five themes which are closely associated with Dickinson's poetry and life-love, marriage, death, loneliness, and melancholy-are curiously inter- woven in Dickinson's valentine. Although love poems comprise one of her</page><page sequence="7">96 Lucy Brashear largest and most controversial subjects, this poem is strangely not of love, but of marriage. In it both heaven and nature have established a cosmic require- ment for all things to become one. Like Shakespeare's headstrong Juliet, Dickinson's persona, anxious for the young man to "seize the one" he loves, does not admit the interlude of courtship. Paul Ferlazzo analyzes Dickinson's early poems on marriage as a "kind of wish fulfillment . . . The speaker longs to serve and attend to the wishes and needs of an imagined husband."14 This evaluation, however, does not describe "Awake ye muses nine." Here Dickin- son's persona fails to affirm the act of giving but rather exults in the advantages of receiving: "And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower." Although Griffith believes that Dickinson wrote love lyrics "for no better reason than her belief that this was the accepted thing" (154), her valentine, with its emphasis on marriage, not love, hardly falls into this category. As the poem indicates, marriage as a social requirement is an immediate concern for the young Dickinson. Her later poetry, however, which she is believed to have written after an unhappy romantic experience, describes love far more than marriage. The wife/bride poems, actually few in number, chart the metamor- phosis from the role of human wife to that of bride of Christ, "Empress of Calvary." Although several critics have agreed with Conrad Aiken's explana- tion of Dickinson's withdrawal from life as a "deliberate and conscious choice""15 based upon the need of a poet for seclusion, this early poem reveals that at the beginning of her career Dickinson considered marriage not merely a social prerequisite but the established way to find happiness. By 1858, when she was writing seriously enough to collect her poems into packets, the subjects of love and marriage continued, but her definitions of them had altered. Dickinson's infatuation with the subject of death, which for some appears to be closely associated with her love poems, is so subtly introduced in the 1850 valentine that its presence has gone almost unobserved: "The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride." Although Ford notes this personifica- tion, he concludes that "she did not intend her poem for anything more than lighthearted, good-humored verse" (88). The image of death, however, seeking union with the living is morbidly woven into an apparently comic poem. It is disturbing evidence of Dickinson's early monomania with a subject that absorbed her throughout her entire life. The theme of loneliness and its attendant melancholy, both of which permeate Dickinson's later poetry, are curiously the propelling motivations for "Awake ye muses nine." Marriage, sanctioned by God, is insurance against the eventuality of loneliness and sadness. When the wave and moon "make them solemn vows, / No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth</page><page sequence="8">SAB 97 lose." Similarly, the speaker reminds the young man that a single life is accompanied by "sad reflection, and wailing instead of song." Although Dickinson's valentine is essentially a happy poem, it clearly anticipates the poet's later predilection for the subjects of loneliness and sadness. In Dickinson's second letter to Higginson in April 1862, she describes herself as a fledgling poet, who has written "no verse-but one or two" (L 261). The existence of more than two hundred poems believed to be written before the winter of 1862, however, belies Dickinson's words. Although her first extant poem proves that she was already metrically proficient, the few remaining poems representative of her early period chart her movement away from metrical precision towards a lyrical form which remained rooted in the meters of hymnology but at the same time mirrored her deviations in rhyme and rhythm. As she explains in a poem she sent to Higginson "We play at Paste" (P 320), an artist deliberately throws away experimental work while searching for self-expression: And our new Hands Learned Gem-Tactics- Practicing Sands .... The fact that Dickinson considered "Awake ye muses nine" good enough to circulate indicates that she was writing poetry before 1850 and had already discarded many "gems" of "paste." But it is the poet's presence as a participant, with its resultant autobio- graphical implications, which make this poem valuable in the Dickinson canon. If her poetry is regarded as one long poem, as it has been recently viewed,16 then her first poem serves as a vantage point from which to examine Dickinson in her youth. It is also her earliest references to those themes which became her "flood subjects." Although this valentine is founded upon comic parody, it reflects paradoxically the religious dilemmas of her early years as well as the primary fears of her mature poetry-loneliness, melancholy, and, above all, death. Famed for her love lyrics, Dickinson's first poem does not speak of human love, but rather emphasizes the social necessity of marriage. Denied the sexual freedom of the creatures of nature, whom Dickinson observed created their own eternity in their perpetuating life cycles, she describes marriage as a human alternative. For Dickinson, marriage satisfied three pressing needs to which she repeatedly returns in her later poetry: a surrogate father to render decisions, an acceptable procedure to fulfill her obsession for a "home," and a way to forestall loneliness. It is ironic that at age twenty Dickinson could consider marriage without love, but at age thirty she was willing to accept love without marriage. By thirty-five, however, Dickin- son could no longer ignore time and space as could the young lovers in her</page><page sequence="9">98 Lucy Brashear youthful valentine. Rather than "bid the world Goodmorrow," she bid the world goodbye and reduced the latitude of her circumference to the chrysalis of her Amherst home. As her space decreased, time also stopped while she, as the "White Election," sought immortality by imitating death. In her compulsion to find the "glory home," Dickinson enacted the presentiment of her earliest poem. In a brilliant study of Dickinson's poetry, Charles Anderson cites as "peculiarly Dickinsonian" her technique of arriving at what she had to say "by indirection."17 Such is the method of Dickinson's comic valentine as it obliquely describes herself and her personal aspirations and with prophetic accuracy foreshadows her destiny. "Awake ye muses nine" should not be remembered solely as Emily Dickinson's first extant poem or as one of her happiest and wittiest, but valued as a key to her metrical development and the earliest record of the imagery and themes which inform her later work.
