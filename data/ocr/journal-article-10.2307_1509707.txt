Scholarship on the subject is impressive, both in its scope and its quality.' On the practical side, European Christians, both Protes- tants and Catholics, have been faced with the often daunting task of rebuilding their places of worship. At the same time, they have been at pains to recover the principles of early church planning and design. The themes that have emerged out of this search for the past have had a profound effect in shaping the attitudes of post-war European Christendom. The planning and design of all ancient places of worship (whether Christian or non-Christian) invariably involved two sets of considerations, one theoretical, the other practical. Under the former category there were at least three factors: the conception of the divinity or divinities to be worshiped, the divinity's rela- tionship to places in general and to a specific cult place in particular, and the perceived relationship of divinity to cult devotees gathered to perform cult acts. *The following titles are under review here: Friedrich Wilhelm Deichmann, "Vom Tempel zur Kirche," in Mullus: Festschrift Theodor Klauser (JAC Erganzungsband 1; Miinster: Aschendorff, 1964); D.

These general- izations are valid for the entire geopolitical span of ancient history, and they are equally relevant to the classification and interpretation of early Christian sanc- tuaries and cult places, including martyria, churches, baptisteries, cemeteries sub divo, hypogea, and catacombs. The six studies discussed here are concerned primarily with one kind of early Christian cult structure, namely, buildings that were designed or otherwise appropriated to house the eucharistic cult. Especially in the case of the Durene evidence, there is some consideration here of the architectural setting of early Christian initiation, or baptism, but the primary focus throughout is on churches. Three of these studies (Deichmann, Stissenbach, and Turner) consider the sub- ject from a more theoretical-theological perspective, and the other three are oriented to more historical and practical-pragmatic considerations. Deichmann's study contains the following propositions. First, there were two kinds of religion in antiquity, one iconic, one aniconic. Each reflected a distinct conception of divinity. Second, iconic religion had its prototypes in Egypt and elsewhere in the Ancient Near East. Iconic religion made divinity present under an anthropomorphic or theriomorphic image, a cult image commonly enclosed within the walls of a cella, a sanctuary within a temple. In the iconic tradition both the image and room that enclosed it-and by extension the whole temple-were perceived to be holy things and holy places, as if divinity were present within the cella of the temple. Because of this potent spiritual presence only priests were allowed to approach the image in the cella ("Tempel ... ein Haus der gottlichen Wohnstatt, Statte dauerder Anwesenheit des Numen; hier steht das Gotterbild oder Gottermal, als der Gott selbst ... allgemein ist es nur dem Priester gestattet, mit dem Gott unter seinem Dache wirklich zu weilen").2 Deichmann's third argument concerns aniconic religion, of which he also finds examples in Anatolia, Arabia, and Palestine. Here the presence of divinity was symbolized by nonfigural objects, baityloi, unhewn stones, and in the case of Israel, by the ark of the covenant. In the postexilic period, according to Deich- mann, the Holy of Holies was an empty room without windows. This room was perceived to encompass the invisible divinity: this was, in Deichmann's words, a step from "Kultmal" to "Kultraum."3 Thus, according to Deichmann, the pre- vailing conception of divinity in this postexilic Israelite context was one in 2 Deichmann, "Vom Tempel zur Kirche," 52. 3 Ibid.: "Dieser g6ttliche Raum (i.e., the Holy of Holies) hat nun die Bedeutung des Mals, das er einst umfassen sollte iibemommen. Der Raum umgrenzt den unsichtbaren Gott: es ist der Schritt vom Kultmal zum Kultraum." 320</page><page sequence="3">PAUL CORBY FINNEY which god was liberated from attachment to any material thing (presumably to be understood as a cult image: "Die Gottesvorstellung ist vom Gegenstand gelost').4 Deichmann's fourth argument concerns synagogue worship in the Hellenistic period. In simple language, he sees this form of worship under the rubric "spir- itualization of cultus":5 synagogue worship involved the reading of scripture and the recitation of prayers, but no sacrifice. The synagogue service took place in a purely secular building stripped of all sacral associations and attributes. In synagogue worship the only holy place was the community itself. The Torah scrolls attested the covenant between God and his people, God who was princi- pally present to his people in his word. Thus, in Deichmann's reading of the evidence, Hellenistic Judaism represents a cult cut loose of all attachment to topographical and spatial restrictions, that is, to places.6 The fifth part of Deichmann's argument concerns the earliest Christian cult forms and the earliest Christian places of worship, both of which he sees as lineally descended from Second Temple Judaism. The basic interpretative matrix here is once again spiritualization of cultus: the earliest form of Chris- tianity (Urchristentum) represents the culmination of a process that began in Hellenistic Judaism and was accentuated and intensified after 70 CE. Because of its spiritualization of cultus, Urchristentum produced no sacred architecture (which presupposed the hallowing of place)-indeed in Deichmann's reading of the subject, the very concepts, sacralization of place and of space, are funda- mentally at odds with the spirit of Urchristentum. This rejection of sacred place and sacred space, Deichmann tells us, puts Urchristentum in a unique position vis-a-vis other ancient high cultures and their religions. In support of the spiri- tualization of cultus in Urchristentum Deichmann gives the familiar locus: John 4:21-25. To support the notion that the only true temple in Urchristentum was the ecclesia, Deichmann gives the equally well-worked Pauline passages: 1 Cor 3:16; 2 Cor 6:16; Eph 2:21. On the theory that Urchristentum rejected the idea of an earthly and material temple Deichmann adduces Acts 7:44-50. Thus, according to Deichmann, the earliest Christian conception of a sacred place was not and could not be translated into an architectonic form. As in Second Temple 4 Ibid. 5 H.

Anything to the contrary would have been perceived as idolatrous.7 The sixth and last part of Deichmann's argument purports to explain how it is that early Christianity (understood as Friihchristentum in contrast to Urchristen- tum ) came to adopt a sacred form of architecture. The primary theory here is that Friihchristentum betrayed Urchristentum: second- and third-century Chris- tianity gradually allowed the pagan concept of sacred place to usurp and ulti- mately to replace the earliest Christian idea of sacred place as ecclesia. For a while, according to Deichmann, Christians such as Clement and Hippolytus remained true to the earliest Christian notion, just as for a while some Christians held true to the earliest Christian rejection of all forms of visual art.8 But gradu- ally, because of pressures from the uneducated masses who were converting to Christianity, the old, pre-Christian and pagan idea of sacred place began to reassert itself. The formation of a clerical hierarchy encouraged the sacraliza- tion of ecclesiastical functions and institutions, including the sacralization of place. But even as late as the fourth century, we are told, the place where Chris- tians gathered to worship remained secular and unconsecrated, and caveats con- tinued to be issued all along from Christian clergy and theologians warning against the dangers of sacralizing place. These warnings fell on deaf ears, how- ever, and the pagan view of sacred place ultimately triumphed. Ecclesia became increasingly the denomination of place rather than of community. Eusebius of Caesarea9 drove the last nails into the coffin of Urchristentum when 7 Ibid., 55: "Das Heiligtum des Urchristentums konnte daher keine irdische Gestalt, eine archi- tektonische Form, annehmen. Es gab keinen von Menschenhand gebauten Tempel. Ein solcher ware Gotzenwerk gewesen. So blieb die irdische Kultstatte ein reiner Zweckbau. Auch der Kult heiligte nicht den Kultplatz. Das Urchristentum hatte keine sakrale Architektur. Denn fur den Sakralbau ist die Heiligung des Ortes Voraussetzung." 8 Ibid., 59 n. 27: "Der Ablehnung eines irdischen, architektonischen Heiligtums in der Zeit der Urkirche ging parallel die Bilderfeindlichkeit." Deichmann's authorities include Th. Klauser, "Die Ausserungen der alten Kirche zur Kunst: Revision der Zeugnisse, Folgerungen fur die archaologische Forschung," Congresso internazionale di archeologia cristiana Atti 6 (Citta del Vaticano, 1965) 223-38; and Hugo Koch, Die altchristliche Bilderfrage nach den literarischen Quellen (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1917) passim, esp. 99: "Es liegt auf der Hand, daB das Christentum zu einer Zeit, wo es noch keine 'Tempel' und 'Heiligtirmer,' keine res sacrae hatte, wo es noch alles Dingliche und Stoffliche von der Heiligkeit ausschloss, auch keine Bilder als Kultgegenstande kannte." 9 Eusebius's speech on the church (ve60; TOD 0Oeo) at Tyre appears at Hist. eccl. 10.4.1-72 (ed. E. Schwartz; GCS 9.2; Leipzig, 1908). The speech is at once a panegyric of Paulinus, bishop of Tyre, and a theological ekphrasis of the building, now more correctly called an architectural theoria (on the Christian use of the latter topos, cf. McVey, "Domed Church as Microcosm," 109ff. [see Appendix]); cf. Stissenbach, Christuskult, 75ff., 133ff., which contains the predictable judgment of Eusebian architectural nomenclature: "Wir stehen also vor einer von ausserhalb der Kirche provo- 322</page><page sequence="5">PAUL CORBY FINNEY in 312 CE he hallowed the Constantinian church building at Tyre. With the per- formance of that action (in verbo ) Christianity had joined pre-exilic Israel and ancient paganism in a common perception of the sacredness of real places and of the spaces that enclose them. In his study of early Christian architecture, Uwe Siissenbach concentrates on Constantine's building program and on the introduction of imperial ideologies and iconographies in the formulation and proclamation of this first Christian emperor's program. The book is richly documented primarily with literary sources designed to adumbrate the major theme. As for the beginning of early Christian architecture and the author's theory of architectural development within early Christianity, Stissenbach offers one chapter, "Die Wende in der Bauidee. Das urchristliche und das konstantinische Sakralbauverstandnis." 1 Compared with Deichmann's earlier essay, there is no new theoretical departure here: the picture of Urchristentum is the same, and the proposed discontinuity between the earliest Christian conception of sacred place (on the evidence of the familiar Pauline proof texts) and the Constantinian conception comes in for extensive comment. Constantine, we are reminded, sacralized places and build- ings and things in general (including pictures). Siissenbach's study, however, does not merely repeat Deichmann's earlier efforts. He has added a great deal of new corroborating documentation. Nonetheless, the theoretical framework is clearly indebted to Deichmann (whom Stissenbach acknowledges as one of his main authorities). Still further in the background of her analytical and theoreti- cal framework looms the work of Hugo Koch1' and of Ritschlian historiography in general, the latter enshrined especially in the historical reconstructions of Adolf von Hamack. 12 zierten grundsatzlichen Wende, nicht vor einer Entwicklungskontinuitat. Und das bedeutet, wie schon angedeutet, nicht nur das Hiniiberfiihren einer inoffiziellen Religion in die Offentlichkeit des Staatskultes, sondem auch den entscheidenden strukturellen Wandel zu einer materiellen Liturgie (shades of Ritschlian idealism!). SchlieBlich fanden wir das neue Sakralbauverstandnis, ausgenom- men wieder die tyrische Kirchweihrede Eusebs, ja ebenfalls zuerst vom Kaiser formuliert." The best introduction to Eusebian architectural nomenclature, in my view, is Ludwig Voelkl's "Die konstan- tinischen Kirchenbauten nach Eusebius" (see Appendix). Panegyric, ekphrasis, and theoria clearly fall within the epideictic tradition, which Eusebius exploited extensively; on the classical models see Theodore C. Burgess, "Epideictic Literature," Studies in Classical Philology 3 (1902) 89-261. 10 Siissenbach, "Christuskult," 83ff. 1 Koch, Die altchristliche Bilderfrage, 93ff. 12 Von Harack's attitudes toward early Christian material culture (and toward the study of this subject) are those of the Ritschlian school, although it must be admitted that von Harack did not write extensively on the subject; cf. his Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, vol. 2 (Tiibingen: Mohr- Siebeck, 1931) 479; also Die Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums, vol. 2 (4th ed.; Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1924) 611-18. On the subject of early Christian architecture, a representative Ritschlian argument was given by A. Hauck, "Kirchenbau," RE 6 (1901) 774ff. Hauck, e.g., was a firm believ- er in the illegitimacy of both the concept and the reality of early Christian architecture: "Man hat wohl von christlicher Baukunst gesprochen. Aber in der Verbindung der beiden Worte liegt derselbe 323</page><page sequence="6">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW In Siissenbach's book, as in Deichmann's study, the earliest Christian con- ception of sacred place (the Pauline meaning) functions as a kind of historical norm against which all subsequent developments are to be judged. In discussing the sixth-century Edessene Chronicle, for example, Siissenbach is convinced that the editor must have been a pagan because a Christian could not have used the term "temple" (haikla) to designate the Christian building destroyed by the flooding of the Daisan (201 CE) in this east Syrian town.13 In short, Paul's literary and theological vision of the community as a locus of divinity becomes a historical criterion by which a sixth-century east Syrian editor, who reworked a nonliterary and nontheological document in Syriac, is judged. In fact, what the Edessene Chronicle records is that the "Temple of the ecclesia of the Chris- tians" was destroyed by the Daisan in 201 CE-Walter Bauer's "das Heiligtum der Kirche der Christen" is acceptable, but his "die heilige Kirche der Christen" is not.14 In its present redaction the Edessene Chronicle represents the editorial work of a Nestorian Christian who lived sometime late in the sixth cen- tury. Against Sussenbach (and Bauer, who also argues against the authenticity of this entry) there is no reason to suppose either on internal or exteral grounds that the Nestorian editor invented the "Temple of the ecclesia of the Chris- tians." In the (third-century?) original there could have been a short entry to this effect which could well have been incorporated into the extant redaction. Suissenbach's conclusions about the beginning of early Christian architecture remain dependent on Deichmann's theory. Constantine, we are told, initiated a totally new era, unprecedented in its conception of the role that places and buildings should play in the lives of Christians. In Stissenbach's reconstruction of the early church, there were no anticipations of Constantine's building pro- gram in Urchristentum; moreover, the Constantinian developments openly con- tradicted the normative postures set up in the apostolic period. In sum, Constan- tine paganized Christianity.15 logische Fehler, wie wenn man von dem christliche Staate spricht. Denn so wenig dadurch, daB die Burger eines Staats Christen sind, der Begriff des Staats geandert wird, so wenig wird das Wesen der Baukunst dadurch umgestaltet, dab sie einem christlichen oder einem nichtchristlichen Volke dient." 13 Siissenbach, Christuskult, 100: "Doch ist soviel klar, daB wir es hier mit dem Protokoll eines Heiden zu tun haben, der das Gebaude ja irgendwie als religiose Einrichtung bestimmen muBte. Die Andersartigkeit der christlichen Religion war ihm dazu, wie die Beispiele lehren, sicherlich unbekannt. Ein Christ aber hatte wohl auch hier die entsprechenden syrischen Begriffe fur 'Haus der Kirche' oder 'Hause des Gebets' verwendet." 14 Bauer, Rechtgliubigkeit und Ketzerei, 17ff. (see Appendix). 15 Siissenbach, Christuskult, 103: "Nach dem Gesagten stellt sich mit Konstantin also auch ein vollig neuartiges christliches Sakralbauverstandnis ein, das nicht nur im BewuBtsein der ersten drei Jahrhunderte keinerlei Vorbereitung findet, sonder auch der apostolischen Tradition scharfstens widerspricht." 324</page><page sequence="7">PAUL CORBY FINNEY Harold Turner's magnum opus is the last of the more theoretically oriented studies under consideration. His is a big book, covering a great many subject areas, so it is impossible to do justice to its scope here. Instead I will focus on one aspect of Turner's book, namely, the light it throws on architectural begin- nings in early Christianity. Turner makes it clear that this part of the story is at the heart of his purpose overall. In part Turner the phenomenologist is faithful to Husserl: his study is concerned with concrete expressions of religious phenomena. Turner is at pains to describe observable religious phenomena as the latter are transmitted in cultic and architectural and theological forms that turn on the question of sacred place and sacred space. But another facet of Turner's literary persona is far from the phenomenology of religion: his book is also a didactic-theological study with a strong analytical thrust. Indeed, Turner's didacticism borders on apologetics. Within the broad scope of world religions, past and present, Turner identifies two genera (with numerous species, subspecies, and a frequent interpenetration of the two generic types) of worship places. The first genus is the temple, a house for a god, a sacred place, a domus dei; the second (in Turner's view a Semitic type) is a house for the people of a god, a "meeting-for-worship house,"16 in Christian nomenclature a domus ecclesiae. Turner's primary objective in this study is nothing less than to prove of the latter genus "that even at the phenomenological and historical level the meeting-house type presents the authentic norm for the Christian tradition."'17 It would be redundant to rehearse all of Turner's arguments here, since his theoretical framework is the same as that of the two studies just discussed. Jesus Christ, we are told, became the definitive locus sacer, replacing all previ- ously existing temples and cult sanctuaries. This new locus sacer in persona then passed into the ecclesia, which at the time of its formation gathered for worship in places that had a neutral and secular character. Gradually, because of circumstances external to the historical evolution of the ecclesia, the true Christian conception of sacred place was diverted and perverted: material realia, places and buildings, came to be perceived as sacred. The domus ecclesiae con- cept was abandoned in the early church but revived in the sixteenth century,'8 and in Turner's judgment, the twentieth century has become once again an 16 Turner, From Temple to Meeting House, 11 - 12. 17 Ibid., 12. Turner argues (as does Deichmann) that the temple type, both in concept and in exe- cution, was an intrusive element in early Christianity, foisted upon the church by external, pagan traditions (ibid., 157-77). He associates the temple type with the phenomenon of civil religion (ibid., 336ff). 18 Ibid., 205-26. 325</page><page sequence="8">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW environment in which the original and authentically historical norm of church design has been rediscovered. 19 There is considerable similarity in tone and purpose between Turner's study and a programmatic pamphlet authored in 1963 by Andre Bieler (with the par- ticipation of Karl Barth and other Calvinist notables).20 Bieler's little pamphlet aimed to define the "Protestant Principle" (understood as the Swiss Reformed position) vis-a-vis church architecture and the design of spaces for worship. He stated the program with exemplary clarity and brevity: 1) the idea that a place can be sacred is a pagan notion foreign to the earliest attested forms of Christianity; 2) communication with divinity in pagan sacred places required the interven- tion of a priesthood-this latter institution is also fundamentally contrary to the historical and spiritual forms of the oldest attested Christianity; 3) the only sacred place in early Christianity was the person of Jesus Christ-this sacred presence then passed to the ecclesia. It is clear, or should be made clear, that these are primarily theological pro- positions, and that they point unmistakably to the Calvinist wing of the Refor- mation. Calvin himself was fastidiously consistent in his exegesis of Acts 7:33 (Exod 3:5), 7:47-49 (in the latter vs Luke has Stephen recite Isa 66:1), and 17:24.21 In all three places he was anxious to underscore the error of those per- sons who imagine that divinity can be localized in a place. The same point, mutatis mutandis, is urged with respect to sacred images in book 1, chap. 11 of the Institutes: the creation of sacred images localizes God and reduces divinity to proportions and forms that are absurdly incommensurate with God's size and 19 Ibid., 309-22. 20 Andrd Bieler, Liturgie et architecture: Le temple des chretiens (Geneva: Labor &amp; Fides, 1961); cf. also "Rundfrage iiber den protestantischen Kirchenbau," Werk 46 (1959) 271- 80, a round table discussion organized by the editorial board of Werk. 21 Corpus Reformatorum vol. 48 (ed. W. Baum, E. Cunitz, E. Reuss; Braunschweig: Schwetschke, 1898). At Acts 7:33, responding to the report (Exod 3:5) that God told Moses to take off his shoes because the place he was standing on was holy, Calvin counters: "Respondeo, hunc Dei praesentiae non loco haberi honorem, et hominum causa praedicari loci sanctitatem." On Acts 7:47- 49 he says that people who imagine that God can be tied to a place do him injury, they worship him supersti- tiously who think that his "numen" can be affixed to a temple; people who worship God, says Cal- vin, according to their own nature (which is space-bound and place-bound) deceive themselves- men must rise above their place-bound nature to seek God spiritually. At Acts 17:24 Calvin exhorts: go outside of yourself, do not measure God by your own mental capacity, do not form any images of God according to your carnal understanding, set him above the world, distinguish him from created things; the man who does not ascend above the world gropes about in empty shadows and appear- ances: "In summa, superstitio Deum in templis manu factis habitare fingit." 326</page><page sequence="9">PAUL CORBY FINNEY majesty.22 With respect to the question of localizing divinity, Calvin returns to the same themes in his exegesis of Exod 25:8 and Deut 12:5,23 both of which he subsumes under the rubric of the Second Commandment. On the former pas- sage ("Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst") Calvin says that one must be wary of imagining anything inconsistent with the true nature of God, as if divinity could be enclosed within a tabernacle, and on the authority of Acts 7:44 and Heb 8:5 he submits the entire Israelite cult furnish- ings (tabernacle, altar, table, ark) to a spiritual and allegorical reading, whereby these things become shadows and images of heavenly realities. As for the Deu- teronomic passage ("You shall seek a place which the Lord your God will choose ... and make his habitation") essentially the same principal of interpre- tation applies: the place which God is said to inhabit cannot be construed as literally the place of his presence-instead God grants to an ignorant humankind a visual symbol redolent of his presence, but in his nature he remains absent ("Atqui nomen Dei habitare dicitur in loco, non sua natura, sed hominum respectu: dum pro ipsorum ruditate, visibile praesentiae suae symbolum statuit ante oculos").24 In point of fact, a great deal of Calvin's exegetical work as well as the con- structive theology which he set forth in the Institutes was inspired by his opposi- tion to idolatry. For Calvin, the localizing of divinity in a man-made place con- stituted a prime example of idolatrous behavior, and he appealed especially to Stephen's speech and the Areopagus speech to argue that the early Christians had been ever vigilant in their opposition to this error of reductionism. To summarize, the studies by Deichmann, Stissenbach (in so far as he is con- cerned with the beginning of early Christian architecture), and Turner (in the same degree) are constructed on a theological proposition: God cannot be con- tained in a place. In antiquity this idea was propounded by various philosophers and theologians. It can be found in the pages of Hellenistic Jewish literature, especially in Philo,25 and it is an idea that was important to the author of Acts. 22 Calvin, Inst. 1.11.1-15, esp. 1.11.2 (every figurative representation of God contradicts his being): "He (Isaiah) teaches that God's majesty is sullied by an unfitting and absurd fiction, when the incorporeal is made to resemble corporeal matter, the invisible a visible likeness, the spirit an inanimate object, the immeasurable a puny bit of wood, stone or gold." 23 Corpus Reformatorum, vol. 52, cols. 403-5 (Exod 25:8: "Et facient mihi sanctuarium, ut habitum in medio eorum"); cols. 391 -93 (Deut 12:5: "Sed locum quem elegerit Iehova Deus vester e cunctis tribubus vestris, ut ponat illic nomen suum ad habitandum, quaeretis, venietisque illuc"). 24 Ibid., col. 392. 25 De som. 1.21-34, 149, 215; De op. mun. 145 ff.: man's mind or soul is the true temple of divinity. Wenschkewitz identified ("Die Spiritualisierung") two kinds of spiritualization of cultus. The first, on the evidence of the prophets, the Psalms, the Hellenistic and Greco-Roman Jewish apo- crypha and pseudepigrapha, and certain New Testament loci, he called "naive." The second, on the evidence primarily of Hellenistic Stocism and Philo, he called the reflective (or philosophical) type. What we now know (a fact which Wenschkewitz could not have known), on the evidence of the 327</page><page sequence="10">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Furthermore, from the second through the fifth centuries CE, the idea was carried forward on the wings of a Patristic florilegium26 that set forth certain Platonizing Stoic commonplaces concerning God and the ways of perceiving divinity. Sub- sequently, in the later history of Christianity there have been numerous writers, such as John Calvin, who wanted to underscore the error of localizing divinity. The studies of Deichmann, Siissenbach, and Turner, therefore, should be understood in this context, namely, the history of a theological (or phil- osophical-theological) idea. But these three studies also assume that this philosophical-theological idea (i.e., divinity cannot be localized) shaped not only all early Christian attitudes but also all early Christian behaviors vis-a-vis place of worship. The early Christian norm, we are told, was indifference to place. The use of an archaeological argument from silence is made to support this presumption; the absence of identifiable Christian places of worship before 200 CE allows the inference that the earliest Christians cared little about the places where they worshiped. From the third century on, it is argued, the archaeological survival of domas ecclesiae further corroborates the presump- tion: the earliest identifiable Christian places of worship show Christians gather- ing in residential structures, secular places to which the worshiping community attached no special religious value. Gradually, however, the theological norm and its architectural expression in domus ecclesiae gave way to a different con- cept and a different architectural reality, namely, sacralization of place in the form of basilicas. What this development is supposed to reveal is a kind of spir- itual recidivism: Christianity gradually slipped back into pre-Christian (and anti-Christian) attitudes and forms of worship. In his recent handbook27 on early Christian archaeology, Deichmann has reasserted this fundamentally Qumran Scrolls, is that Wenschkewitz's second type was by no means restricted to Jewish Hellenis- tic philosophers in the Diaspora (such as Philo), but instead it had profound resonances in the home country among late Hellenistic Palestinian Jews; cf. Klinzing, Die Umdeutung. 26 The component parts of this florilegium have never been assembled carefully and commented on in full, but it would be useful to do so. The tradition is attested widely, e.g., Clement, Strom. 7.5.28, 1-7.6.30,1; Minucius Octavius 32; Origen C. Cel. 1.5 (von Amim, Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta, frg. 265), but these are only three among dozens of sources that corroborate the existence of this florilegium. This tradition aims to prove that man is the true temple of divinity. Although there are what I have called "die entfemten Vorganger" ("TOPOS HIEROS," 212 n. 45) there is no doubt, in my opinion, that the immediate source of this Christian florilegium was the Stoic-Hellenistic doxographic tradition which Greek-speaking Christians had access to under a host of variant forms (Hermann Diels, Doxographi Graeci [4th ed.; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1965] passim) and which Latin Christians also knew through Cicero and his sources in the De natura deorum. For one very famous Christian's exploitation of this florilegium-doxographic tradition, namely Augustine, see the superb article by Pierre Courcelle, "Parietes faciunt christianos?"

In the matter of architectural beginnings, for example, he has gone back to the essay he wrote in 1964, and reaffirmed the conclusions he drew in that study. Moreover, he has seen fit to criticize28 Richard Krautheimer (on whom, see infra) for the latter's failure to recognize the religious roots which supposedly provide the key to interpreting both the absence and the presence of Christian architectural forms in the pre- Constantinian period. Deichmann's work on this subject amounts to a kind of dogmatic history. One can only speculate about the author's motivation. It is not clear that Deich- mann is aware of the many pitfalls inherent in adducing literary-theological sources as the basis for the writing of history. In any case, the rudiments of dog- matic history are unmistakable in Deichmann's work. Prompted evidently by Calvinist historiography conjoined to several New Testament proof texts, this author argues a proposition whose components are part philosophy and part theology (Acts 7:48; 17:24: it is inconsistent with the true nature of divinity to localize god). He then turns this proposition into a historical "norm" and judges early Christian historical developments against the norm. The fact that the evidence is either very spotty (as in the case of literature) or nonexistent (as in the case of archaeology) helps the cause of arguing from silence. Further- more, Deichmann ignores the fact that the literary evidence does not really speak to the question of what happened in the real lives of early Christians. In the end this kind of intellectual exercise may or may not be useful in some con- text other than history, but it contributes little to our understanding of what really happened in the past. In moder scholarship Richard Krautheimer's work is the basic point of departure for the historical study of the beginnings of early Christian architec- ture. In 1939 he published an essay on the subject, which in turn was repub- lished (with a postscript) in 1969.29 In 1965 Krautheimer summarized the results of his investigations on this subject in his authoritative contribution to the Penguin History of Art (see above, n. 1). On the subject of beginnings, Kraut- heimer distinguishes three periods: 50-150 CE, 150-250 CE, and 250-313CE. 28 Ibid., 85: "Die Darstellung bei Krautheimer (referring to the third mentioned work reviewed here) ... wo das Fehlen der religiosen Wurzeln eines Kultbaus in der urchristlichen Periode nicht erkannt ist." To which the best rejoinder is that Krautheimer had the good sense to refrain from the theological speculations in which Deichmann indulged. 29 The original essay, entitled "The Beginning of Early Christian Architecture," RR 3 (1939) 127-48, was reissued (with a postscript and additional bibliography) in Richard Krautheimer, Stud- ies in Early Christian, Medieval, and Renaissance Art (New York: New York University Press, 1969) 1-20. 329</page><page sequence="12">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW For the first period there is no extant archaeological evidence, at least none that constitutes direct evidence of Christian beginnings. The historian must rely instead on the very fragmentary entries in the familiar theological-literary sources which report the meetings of Christians for worship. Krautheimer's view of this first period can be reduced to one simple observation: Christians gathered for worship "in whatever place suited the occasion."30 Depending on the geographical locale and the time period, Christians worshiped in the Jerusalem temple, in synagogues, in private apartments or in houses. Most Christians, Krautheimer believes, congregated in the latter setting (and specifically in the dining area), where they fitted their eucharistic liturgies into the available residential spaces. This is a feasible reconstruction, even though it depends on sources (such as the New Testament, epecially Acts) whose eviden- tiary value is problematic, indeed elusive. Within this earliest period of Chris- tian history Krautheimer does not discuss the matter of putative attitudes toward sacred place. Given the nature of the evidence (or lack of it), Krautheimer's silence on this subject is a sign of good historical sense. It is also clear that in Krautheimer's reading of the subject, the earliest Christian attitudes toward real places to be utilized for worship were motivated in great degree by practical considerations, such as the size of the community, its organization and its finan- cial resources (or lack of them). For his second period, Krautheimer envisages a substantial growth of Chris- tian populations in places like Asia Minor, North Africa, and Rome, and he is convinced that Christians in these territories increasingly required larger and more complex buildings for worship. This is the period when Christian com- munities (churches) began to acquire title (or at least real control) of whole buildings, which they converted to meet the needs of assembly and worship. For the most part, in Krautheimer's view, these converted structures were residential in character; on their exterior these former houses would have contin- ued to resemble the other domestic structures in their immediate environs. Only in the interior of these buildings were significant changes in the disposition of space introduced; the Dura house church is the primary surviving example. This period is typified under the rubric domus ecclesiae: apartments and houses that were made over on their interiors in order to accommodate a community of wor- ship. In Rome such structures are commonly denominated tituli, which means they are identified by the names of the putative former owners who are thought to have donated (or otherwise conveyed under circumstances that cannot be reconstructed)31 their once private properties to the church for architectural 30 Krautheimer, Early Christian Architecture, 24. 31 The legal conditions by which local pre-Constantinian churches (understood as ecclesiae, i.e., corporate entitites under the shadow of religio illicita) acquired real property (a public action requir- ing, inter alia, the recording of a deed) is a subject bedeviled by a plethora of speculation in the 330</page><page sequence="13">PAUL CORBY FINNEY conversion and use as a place of worship. In Rome several of the earliest domus ecclesiae (or tituli) may have been installed in apartments within larger tenement complexes. Krautheimer gives the example of SS. Giovanni e Paolo. Here we have second-century shops on the ground floor joined to apartments above, in a building connected to a bath com- plex sometime before the mid-third century. On the upper floor a large hall, made by joining together several smaller residential spaces, may have served as a place of Christian assembly in the later third century. In the last third of the century a confessio was installed, and roughly a century later a basilica replaced the original structure. Krautheimer envisages similar scenarios of architectural adaptation and gradual conversion at San Clemente and Santa Pudenziana (in this latter example, a second-century bath house probably constituted the origi- nal architectural matrix which was converted into a church). In Krautheimer's third period domts ecclesiae continued to be used, but there may have been occasional construction of Christian churches de novo, at least toward the very end of the third century and in the early years of the fourth. He cites San Crisogono in Trastevere, a hall church which may have been designed and constructed as a Christian building in the period before Constantine. San Sebastiano could have been designed and built, in Krautheimer's view, just before Constantine entered Rome in 312 CE. Willy Rordorf's study (the second entry listed at the beginning of this review) is also based on literary and archaeological sources. He begins with a fairly exhaustive discussion of the places where Christians gathered, according to the New Testament sources, namely, in Jerusalem, Asia Minor, Syria, Rome, and Greece. He concludes that for the first and most of the second centuries many Christians worshiped in spaces that were made available to the commun- ity by church members-apartments and private houses. Rordorf then considers a smattering of later second- and third-century literary-theological sources (Irenaeus's Letter to Florinus, Acts of Justin and his Companions, Ps- Clementines, Acts of Peter, Acts of Thomas, Passion of Caecilia) on the use of residential structures for missionary preaching purposes. He concludes these buildings may have served for worship purposes in the capacity of "churches." Domus ecclesiae is a term that is attested in the Ps-Clementines and in the Pas- sion of Caecilia; and Rordorf thinks, though the evidence is hardly compelling, that use of the whole building, and not just of a room within it, is implied by the domus ecclesiae nomenclature. Naturally, Dura constitutes the primary absence of hard evidence. A useful introduction to the subject is Bovini, La proprietd ecclesiastica (see Appendix). On legal problems, specifically the government's view of Christians' juridical status (i.e., Christians as individuals [citizens or noncitizens] under the law, and Christians as members of a corporate entity that was illegal), see A.

Rordorf mentions briefly the Roman titular churches, and he discusses the famous North African (Cirta): vessels, books, lamps, clothing, jars and other vessels, though none of these is an architectural feature.32 As for the orientation of rooms within the typical domus ecclesiae, Rordorf bases his observation on evidence provided by Tertul- lian and Clement, namely, that prayer was oriented to the east.33 Rordorf finds archaeological confirmation of this theological-literary evidence in the Dura 32 The source, which dates from the early period of the Donatist controversy, is the so-called Gesta apud Zenophilum (Appendix I) which appears in S. Optati Milevitani Libri VII (ed. Karl Ziwsa; Leipzig: Freytas, 1893) 186-88. Munatius (Menetius) Felix, "flamen perpetuus" of Numi- dian Cirta received orders to confiscate the possessions of certain Christians whose property was housed in a building described as "domus in qua christiani conveniebant." Munatius confronted Paul, the Bishop of the community, at the house, and the Christians there produced 2 gold lamps, 12 silver vessels, a silver kettle, 7 silver lamps, 2 wax candles, 18 bronze lamps, 82 women's tunics, 38 women's veils, 16 men's tunics, 13 pairs of men's shoes, 47 pairs of women's shoes, and 19 thongs. The library cupboards yielded an additional silver box and a silver lamp. The triclinium yielded 4 jars and 6 barrels and one large tome-the latter may suggest that the meal cult (eucharist?) was cele- brated in the dining room. Munatius Felix then went to the houses of certain lectores where he gath- ered many additional volumes and two fascicules, or parts of volumes. The domus in question was clearly just that, a house that was being used by Christians. He argues that the conditions of domus ecclesiae varied from place to place, but all shared certain common interior features which are those mentioned in the case of the church at Cirta. 33 Nat. 1.13.1 (ed.

At 43.8 Clement closes this lovely passage with Ps 141:2: "Let my prayer be counted as incense before thee, and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice!" Both Tertullian and Clement present their thoughts on this subject in contexts which are literary and theological. This is in con- trast, e.g., to the prescriptions concerning liturgical orientation to the east in the Syriac Didascalia apostolorum 57.5-6 (ed. Richard Hugh Connolly; Oxford: Clarendon, 1929); cf. Otto Nussbaum, Der Standort der Liturgen am christlichen Alter vor dem Jahre 1000 (Bonn: Hanstein, 1965) 395ff. The lost Greek archetype of this sixth-century Syriac text probably should be dated to the early third century-in any event it might be argued on principle that a church order is likely to be a better reflection of real practices in the early church than is a literary-theological text. 332</page><page sequence="15">PAUL CORBY FINNEY house church, i.e., the Dura house church which was plundered on 19 May 303.34 At the end of his study Rordorf turns to the problem of distinguishing between early Christian buildings that were domus ecclesiae and those that were new constructions, designed and executed de novo, buildings conceived for exclusively religious functions and that served only in a religious capacity dur- ing the history of their occupancy in the third and fourth centuries. The sources he consults on this subject are mostly the traditional literary-theological loci communes of the Patristic era. According to Rordorf, Christians gradually aban- doned the domus ecclesiae framework in favor of bigger and independent build- ings, because of a growing Christian population. He questions whether the basilical type of church building existed before the Constantinian period. It is not entirely clear what Rordorf means by basilical type, but he wants to derive the Christian basilica in its Constantinian form from secular, hall-like basilicas. On historical and archeological grounds (as argued by John Ward-Perkins),35 this is a probable connection. Rordorf asks whether Christian buildings of this sort existed in the second and third centuries. Because there were so-called basilical synagogues in the pre-Constantinian period, Rordorf thinks this must have been true of churches as well, but this argument from analogy fails to be convincing. The third and last of the historically oriented studies to be considered here is Michael White's 1982 dissertation. For students and scholars interested in the question at hand, this study is indispensible. It is valuable on other subjects as well, including the author's comparative discussion of Mithraism and Judaism. On architectural beginnings, White offers a clear and concise historiographic overview which traces various views of the subject back to the late nineteenth century. He discusses the attempts of Georg Dehio, Walter Lowrie, Louis Duchesne, and Gregory Dix, inter alios, to derive the earliest Christian architec- tural forms from the Roman atrium house.36 Although this theory has long been abandoned by historians of early Christian architecture, White finds reasons, connected with his evolutionary model, to retain at least parts of the atrium house theory. He also discusses the attempts of the late John Ward-Perkins37 to establish (on the evidence of San Giovanni in Laterano, 314 CE) an early fourth-century terminus a quo of the first Christian basilical plan and (on the 34 Rordorf, "Gottesdienstraume," 121, 122 (citing A. von Gerkan at RG 42 [1934] 226ff). At the east end of the south room, no. 4 (Kraeling's so-called Assembly Hall) there is a bema that projects from the east wall. Rordorf, relying on von Gerkan (who is often unreliable) speculates that this platform was surmounted by a "Bischofsstuhl." This is excessive interpretation, but if room 4 was used for church assembly (as seems likely), then one fact is clear: the community faced east. 35 "Origins of the Christian Basilica," 69 - 90. 36 White, "Domus Ecclesiae," 11- 18. 37 Ibid., 20ff. 333</page><page sequence="16">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW evidence of Johann Peter Kirsch and Richard Krautheimer) to establish a diachronic-architectonic relationship between fourth/fifth century Christian basilicas and earlier Roman places of Christian assembly. (Within Roman tene- ment complexes these are the residences which were thought to constitute struc- tural nucleii of the later Roman titular churches).38 In setting forth his developmental model of early Christian architecture, White distinguishes five periods,39 defined not so much by chronological termini as by stages of development that varied in absolute time from place to place. As far as architectural history is concerned, this is the most important part of White's study. These five stages possess what might be best called a predictive and heuristic value. They need to be applied and tested in the field, in each and every archaeological context where there is even the suspicion of Christian architectural activity, from the late first century through the end of the fourth. In my opinion, White's five stages represent a quantum leap in our understanding of the incremental process by which Christian architecture was brought into the world. White's view of this subject represents the most intelligent construal of the evidence to date, although admittedly the subject, especially at the lower end of the development, is bedeviled by archaeological evidence that is either very meager or nonexistent. Nevertheless, it seems feasible that White's model of architectural development will be fully vindicated over time. White's five-fold model reads as follows: 1) the house church period (or stage) in which private houses were used (without architectonic alteration) as places of Christian assembly; la) the first intermediate stage between house church and domus ecclesiae in which there was selective and partial architectonic alteration on the interior of domestic structures to accommodate Christian assembly. White's examples: the Villa beneath the Basilica Euphrasiana at Parentium-Parenzo (Porec), Istria, and the so-called chapel wing in the Roman Villa at Lullingstone Park near Eyns- ford; 2) the domus ecclesiae period (or stage) in which private houses were archi- tectionically altered (completely on the interior) to accomodate Christian assem- bly. Dura gives the best attested example; 2a) the second intermediate stage between the domus ecclesiae (as defined by the Durene evidence) and the addition (by "remodeling") to the domus ecclesiae of larger rectangular hall-like structures (aula ecclesia )-the latter is a harbinger of basilical planning but lacks, mutatis mutandis, some or all of the formal features of basilical architecture. The examples are San Crisogono, SS. Giovonni e Paulo, San Clemente, the church at Qirqbize in Syria, the "Juli- 38 Ibid., 21ff. 39 Ibid., 25-40, 475-519. 334</page><page sequence="17">PAUL CORBY FINNEY anos" church at Umm-el-Jimal (which White puts in Syria), the north hall of the church of Theodore at Aquileia, and the building (or buildings) beneath the Jus- tinianic octagonal structure at Philippi (about which nothing has yet been pub- lished).40 3) the third period (or stage) which introduces basilical planning and the exe- cution de novo of Christian basilicas. At the very least this stage of construction was bankrolled substantially by Constantine, and it seems not unlikely that the full basilical plan of a Christian church was introduced for the first time under his tutelage. In other words the Emperor was the main player in bringing about this third stage of development. Insofar as architectural origins are concerned, the essential part of White's study is his emphasis on a developmental model which underscores the gradual transformation of already existing architectonic spaces and places. This incre- mental approach clearly squares with the archaeological evidence, especially with reference to the transition from stages 2a to 3. White is at pains here to point out that the basilical form was anticipated in the third-century aulae ecclesiae. Furthermore, as White demonstrates, identical architectonic changes did not occur simultaneously in all places. Especially in provincial territories (White cites the Magreb and Britain as examples) there is convincing archaeo- logical evidence to suggest that the archaic architectural modes of Christian assembly (e.g., stages la and 2a) were still in use long after the Constantinian revolution had changed the shape of urban places of Christian assembly (e.g., in Rome). This is an essential distinction, one that students of early Christianity will want to take to heart (if they have not already done so, at the promptings of Walter Bauer and Helmut Koester, on the evidence of literary sources).41 The underlying message here is synchronic diversity of architectural practice: dif- ferent forms for different people according to different liturgical and demo- graphic and social conditions. White's larger purpose in his study is to ferret out the historical factors that caused architectural change and development in the early Christian period. He points to factors such as the social composition of the church, its growing popu- lation, its gradual acquisition of wealth, both real and personal, as well as changes in the liturgy and in the definition of church offices and their incum- bents. Regarding the issue of social composition, White reveals his intellectual formation at the outset of this study. He clearly belongs with the revisionists: 40 For a discussion of Church D (containing the Octagon) at Philippi (with reference to earlier work on this structure) see Stylianos Pelekanides, "ANAZKAOH OIAIHII2N, HICpacTtKa tfi; Ev 'A0ivatx 'ApXaoXoytKii 'Etatpetia (1973) 55-69, esp. 58-65. 41 Bauer, Rechtgldubigkeit und Ketzerei, with a postscript by Georg Strecker (see Appendix); Hel- mut Koester, "TNf2MAI AIA0OPOI: The Origin and Nature of Diversification in the History of Early Christianity," HTR 58 (1965) 299- 311. 335</page><page sequence="18">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Edwin Judge, Wayne Meeks,42 and others, who have questioned the received opinion of the low social and economic condition that supposedly typified the rank and file of the pre-Constantinian church. Like his mentors, White is at pains to disabuse the reader of the notion that all early Christians were poor and came from low social origins. The architectural evidence, consisting both of literary sources that bear on the subject and of archaeological remains, belie this standard view of the early church. At the very least, in White's opinion, sub- stantial modifications of the received opinion are in order. White has convinced himself that many or most of the house churches that came into Christian ownership were donated and/or financed by rich community members; he believes further that many of these rich Christians went on to assume leadership roles and hold ecclesiastical offices in the pre-Constantinian church.43 By exploiting especially the architectural sources he has added a new chapter to the revisionist theory, and he has made a very strong case for the for- mative roles played by rich patrons within the earliest Christian communities. But perhaps even more important for the history of early Christian architecture is White's underscoring of one signal fact: among the numerous features which shaped early Christian architecture a major consideration was money, or its equivalent, land. For example, whether the Dura house church was conveyed to the local church by a rich patron or was acquired through purchase by pooling of community resources (White thinks the former), the indisputable facts remain: (1) this community had title to, or possession of, real property; (2) the building and the land it sat on possessed real and considerable value, in terms of the local economy; and (3) the Christian renovations on the interior of the build- ing (especially in Room 6, the baptistery) were extensive and costly. White may be correct in speculating that the renovations were contracted out to profession- als, but in any event the Christian transformation of this building was accom- plished at considerable expense. In short, the Dura house church reflects wealth which resided somewhere within the domain of this obscure Syrian Christian community, either in a rich patron's purse, or in the coffers of several less wealthy people, or in both. It is good to see this fact underscored: too often stu- dents of early Christianity neglect the tremendous growth of real and personal property which accrued to the church over the course of the second and third centuries and which contributed to the successes of the new religion, especially in urban centers. 42 For a critical review of Wayne Meeks's The First Urban Christians (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1983), see Morton Smith, "Perils of the Paulines," The Washington Post Book World 13:15 (10 April 1983) 15; for a survey of literature published between 1970 and 1980, see Daniel J.

Early Christian attitudes toward cult places and sacred places are clearly a crucial consideration in the growth of church architecture during the pre-Constantinian period. Part of the evidence regarding such atti- tudes is literary and theological in character; part is archaeological. White's study deals with both kinds of evidence, and the author presents a balanced and intelligent reconstruction on both sides of the evidentiary fence. In any discus- sion of the role that sacred place played (or did not play) within early Christian- ity, it is essential to clarify the extent and the nature of the evidence. The authors of the three studies discussed at the outset of this essay failed to do just that, and hence they produced what must be judged a distorted and quasi- historical reconstruction of the past. Place (topos, locus) in early Christianity is a concept that is nuanced in three distinct contexts. First, early Christian writers used the term often in the tradi- tional secular manner to denote geographical and geopolitical identities. Second, these same writers used the term theologically. The most familiar metaphor in this latter category is the amalgam of place and person: the Johan- nine Jesus, for example, became a locus sacer. Paul extended the metaphor to include a community of persons, the ecclesia, which was viewed as the exten- sion in time and space of Jesus' sacred place-person. The theios aner concept, which Peter Brown has brilliantly adumbrated in recent times, falls under the same theological typology:44 Antony was functionally a sacred place-person, and so was Simeon. Third and last, early Christian writers used the idea of place philosophically.45 The familiar usage invokes (in a rather anti-Hellenic manner) the negation of place as an attribute of divinity. The god of the Areo- pagus speech, for example, is a divinity who cannot be confined within any place-this rapidly becomes the theos achoretos of middle Platonism and, not coincidentally, of the Greek Christian apologists writing in the second and third centuries. In sum, place in early Christianity is a complex concept. In the first instance, its meaning depends upon its literary context. It may refer to geographical realia, or to theological and philosophical concepts. Furthermore, beyond ques- tions of literary interpretation, there is the nonliterary evidence of churches and 44 "The Rise and Function of the Holy Man in Late Antiquity," JRomS 61 (1971) 80-101; and also Ludwig Bieler, OEIOE ANHP (1935/1936; reprinted Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchge- sellschaft, 1967). 45 The literature on the philosophical topos is endless.

If and when such a history appears, its value will consist in the author's ability to identify the dif- ferent meanings that attached to place in the different locations (literary, material, and personal) where early Christians found meaningful epiphanies of the holy.
