The elegance of the provided food and alcohol (usually), and the arrangement of the hierarchical seating plans, vary over time. Indeed, ar ranging the hierarchy of seating has always been an exacting, complex pleas ure for hosts and hostesses. Public and, more often, private dining groups supply opportunities for displaying (and distributing [potlatch]) wealth, cadg ing nourishment, enjoying company (the standard justification), celebrating milestones, and manipulating status (among those both present and absent). Stronger stuff now often replaces wine in Euro-American venues, song is usu ally prerecorded, but women (not to mention attractive "boys") are less fre quently warm flesh objects of and for pleasure, sometimes hired merely to spice the evening or available as permanent and reusable or disposable pos sessions. 1.

Plautus, Terence, Horace, Petronius, and Martial mention details in passing. The etiquette of dining, lovemaking, and the initiation of verbal exchanges illuminate Roman hierarchies - salve and ave, greetings and faretheewells, in the public streets or in another man's atrium,2 etc. The gestures and postures of every community also nuance mo mentary or durable equalities and their breaches. Classicists have begun to investigate certain nonverbal and paralinguistic features of narratives and im ages. Here one includes convivial diners' elevation, order of seating and being served, or lovers' relative elevation on a couch (and who penetrates whom), or the distance from which a greeter waives, possibly clasps a hand,3 and/or hugs and kisses another of same or "opposite" sex.4 Jon Hall's helpful study of the functions of greetings reminds one that any seemingly trivial exchange may encode several messages. They may ini tiate equal exchanges, or express dominance and condescension, or con versely, deference by volunteering the first gesture or word. Honorifics convey respect, such as domine from a slave to master, or other greeting-up terms from a client to a patron (e.g., patrone mi [ad Att. 7.29]).5 The rituals of the salutatio6 reinforced, verbally and visually, Roman hierarchies. The client's offering of honor and the patron's recognizing that ceremony (resalutare) display the nexus - the pressures of personal obligation, a client's access to protection and other services as well as the patron's expectations of public status-acknowl edgment. Meeting with such verbal and nonverbal tact and respect, publicly displayed, warmed Cicero's status-hungry novus homo heart (e.g., Cic. Q. Fr. 2.15.2, Att. 2.22.3; contra, Clodius' negative numbers: Att. 4.3.5 [Hall 418 n.6]). The successful manipulation of these semi-public mini-dramas increased the influence and security of both Roman patrons and clients. Both, however, were 2. Such salutationes can be relaxed and amiable, or formal and demanded.

Breaches of the norms, the protocols, capture the attention of poets and painters, a fact that is hardly surprising, given the human desire to enjoy the discomfiture of others (pace Hall 426). These faux pas can evoke cruel laughter. The Italian world of the later Republic and earlier Empire may expect less openly articulated deference than the more explicitly hierarchical and cere monial societies that followed in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, but certainly it practiced more candid expressions of power relations (deference) than one encounters today in most bourgeois levels of contemporary Euro American societies. Horace, in the middle of the well attested period consid ered by both books under review, calibrated the proxemics of patronage - closing down distances or expanding them, depending on the status of his in terlocutors. He repels the boor in the forum, but he can visualize himself as the same kind of pest, when he seeks entree to the house of lofty Maecenas (Sat. 1.6,1.9.56: difftciles aditus primos habet). In the former, comical situation, Horace (Sat. 1.9.76-7, cf. Plaut. Pers. 745-8), seeking to escape an unwanted hanger on, recalls a litigant's welcome touching of him in the forum, specifically touching his ear to summon a witness: "Licet antestari"? Ego [Horatius] vero I oppono auriculam. This haptic earlobe ceremony must be very early; already the summoning of the witness appears in the XII Tables. One can barely per ceive the formation of an interesting legal procedure arising from a prior form of casual civic intercourse. One now finds a feast of titles on ancient food-ways, including both diet and dining habits.

Matthew Roller's book treats one element (posture, also proxemics) of an es sential aspect of Roman social life, dining habits beyond the basic ingestion of nourishment, the required refueling of the animal body. He analyzes literary, epigraphic, and pictorial evidence, representations of diners and their providers as they recline, sit, or stand.9 Eating pig brain pate or fried fillet of electric eel while prone, dorsal, or crouching has never appealed to many be cause of the physics of human digestion and skeletal comfort. He correctly identifies these three basic body-positions or postures of individuals. He does not examine as thoroughly proxemic complications of the parties: "place set ting." This last category includes hierarchies of distance, serial order, the eti quette of orientation to the host: who sits in the places of honor (e.g., consularis) and who has the worst view, etc., in this display of civilized deportment. Plutarch's brother Timon and their father disagreed about this hostly obliga tion (Mor. 615 C-E). Standing to eat on various occasions is a sign not only of lesser status, but sometimes even of a degraded one. Soldiers who disgraced themselves could be required to eat standing. Caligula required high magistrates to stand in his vicinity while he dined - a proxemic mark of disrespect.10 Romans in mourning declined to recline at meals. C. Terentius Varro, the survivor of Can nae (numquam recubans), and Cato Minor, after Pompeius' defeat at Pharsalus, would only sit at meals (Front. Strat. 4.5.6; Plut. Cat. Min. 56.7). The fast-food popinae did not afford a place to recline, so patrons used stools or benches. The easy equality required of diners at ordinary commercial establishments made them anathema to the status-anxious Juvenal because they disarticulated so cial distinctions by posture, deportment, and placement privileging (Sat. 8.172-8). Keenly attuned to differences in class (legal and social status), gender, and age, Roller examines "how power relationships among the diners are as serted, displayed, and contested" (4) by means of posture in the Italian world be tween 200 BCE and 200 CE (ll).11 He takes issue with the handbooks' gastronomic topics from antiquity through the Renaissance. See, recently, for a provincial cuisine, H. E. Cool, Eating and Drinking in Roman Britain (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006). 9. A.

Body Language in the Greek and Roman Worlds (Swansea: Classical Press of Wales, 2005) 215-38, consider implications of dining posture and the gendering of pos tures. 10.

Inadequate data bases (elite Roman literary texts differ from "subelite"12 Italian images in stone, metal, fresco, and mosaic); insufficient attention to articulated sub-hi erarchies (among, e.g., free adult males); and unobserved slippage between all extant representations (ideologies projected) and alleged "snapshots" of small scale lived reality, social practice.13 Roller built his database on a core vocabulary of reclining words (cubo, *cumbo, *clino) assembled from electronic sources (PHI, TLG) and catalogues of images, e.g., of grave stelae, funerary altars, kline monuments, and Cam panian paintings, etc. He recognizes that extensive related materials on loaded tables exist beyond his announced temporal, geographic, and generic limits, and usefully brings in such information when needed.14 Roller taps into contemporary fascination with the body as locus of social cynosure: its vulnerabilities, needs, deformities, beauty, and expressive ca pacities (laughter, tears, winks). The Romans train bodies in self-revealing and other-controlling techniques: self-presentation, surveillance of others, presta tion, and status-manipulation. Dinner parties occur among nearly all statuses as well as to all ages and both genders. They were more frequent and flexible in their arrangements than certain other opportunities for self-display such as oratory and celebrations of military achievement (such as receiving honors or holding a triumph). "Privilege, leisure, [and] autonomy" (13) always seek and find spaces for expression - immediate performances public and private for contemporaries, and iconographic mementos for imagined posterities (fa milial and civic, such as grave altars, ash urns, and commemorative statues in the forum). Those intended meanings were usually immediately readable by Italic contemporaries, but the intervening epochs obscure the understanding of decoders today. A further complication noted by Roller is modern scholarship's reflexive inclination to read Roman practice by the dim light of Greek. How useful and in what ways are Etruscan funeral frescoes, Plato's philosophical dialogue, Symposium, Plutarch's extended ninety-five Quaestiones Conviviales (Mor. 612c 784d),15 or even Athenaeus' anecdotal Deipnosophistae for understanding the literary cenae of Plautus, Cicero, Horace, and Trimalchio, a fortiori for under 12. A case can be argued for this neologism (not in the online OED) that describes people of pretensions: those hoping either to join the elite or determined (like Tri malchio) to ape that class's customs and fiscal extravagance. 13. Roller sets aside civic dining. This Italian institution fed large crowds assembled for this purpose in public spaces. Such euergetism depends on tax-collections and public benefactions (endowments; cf. Dunbabin, The Roman Banquet [above, n. 8] 72-102, and reff., a survey of the monuments for "Public Dining"). Trimalchio's tomb will show his two-denarii banquet for the public and the host sitting high on a dais (Sat. 71). Thus, the banquet functions on three levels: the actual private cena, the historical benefaction, and the marmoreal and funereal commemoration of that public banquet. 14. P. 13, n. 18 lists studies of feast and sympotic conventions in the ancient Near East, Greece, Etruria, etc. 15.

Roller (65-7) disputes the view of Clarke (Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans [above, n. 8] 227-33) and others that Pom peian convivial paintings are based on Hellenistic sympotic originals. He be lieves that Italians did not need to import a template for party behaviors within their "cultural horizons." Roller situates his study of posture - a subject allegedly (formulaically) "almost entirely neglected by classicists" (10)?within the larger field of non verbal behavior. While he plainly recognizes the attention already paid to ges ture, he minimizes the essential connection between two aspects of "the silent languages, languages without words." Roller finds special importance for pos ture in "situations where social hierarchies are being constructed and dis played."16 This self-evident claim seems only truer, if one enlarges the topic to proxemics, incorporating the relationships of bodies to other bodies as well as the position of each one itself. Thus, sitting or reclining postures are more in formative when related to the couch positions at a convivium - who is found where in relation to the host and principal guest at, say, Trimalchio's bash. Roller devotes three chapters to three groups divided by gender (male [1], female [2]) and by age (children [3]), the last and least of the three (deter mined by the available images). Chapter One treats first literary evidence for the pleasures of the otiosi.17 Roller surveys mostly Italian poets and prose au gen des Verhaltens in den weltlichen Oberschichten des Abendlandes (Basel: Haus zum Falken, 1939) = The Civilizing Process: 1. The History of Manners (ET: E. Jephcott, New York: Pantheon Books, 1978), or the popular, useful work of M. Visser, The Rituals of Dinner: the Origins, Evolution, Eccentricities, and Meaning of Table Man ners (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1991). 16. P. 10. Roller's reflexive claim of his subject's comparative and strange neglect is unnecessary and untrue, although he has taken the topic to a higher level.

Neither book under review mentions the clas sic study of ancient gestures, C. Sittl, Die Gebarden der Griechen und Rbmer (Leipzig: B. G. Teubner, 1890), but Sittl wrote little on dining postures and laughter. 17. Brian A. Krostenko's study, Cicero, Catullus, and the Language of Social Performance (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001; reviewed by this reviewer in Semi otica 144 [2003] 359-75) considers the republican elites' convivial language but not their postures or other habits of bodily performance. Roller distinguishes between the elite's otium, a brief break from their negotia of clientage and office holding, and the subelite's different otium, their quintessential civic freedom and freedom from public business. Lauren H.

Sit ting, or better, reclining and not expending energy to bring food into reach (i.e., being served), unsurprisingly denotes higher status (21). Next Roller dis cusses ash urns with "convivial scenes" found on only 11 of 698 examples in one catalogue, and 19 of 708 funerary altars in another.18 This rarity may sur prise the reader, since both media flourish most 50 CE to 150 CE, a period of lavish parties and stone-spectacles, as both Trimalchio's entertainment and objects rescued from the ash and dirt attest.19 Many Roman funeral monuments exhibit "hierarchical scaling," crude examples of symbolic sizing in which smaller figures indicate lesser impor tance (29). Roller interprets many of these smaller figures on convivial images as recording (or dreaming of, when not wealthy) the availability of adoles cent male attendants for sexual as well as for gustatory dining services (33). Whether or not the dead enjoyed all the pleasures of wine, women (or boys), and song that are illustrated, they want to be commemorated as having had the opportunities. Debates continue as to whether these grave images repre sent the deceased in their former earthly life or anticipate the banquets of the next world (Dunbabin, The Roman Banquet [above, n. 8] 108).20 Belonging so cially was important (36) in both, whatever your legal status in either. Even without food, garlands, or food tables, the presence of a lectus, a drinking ves sel, and the de rigeur reclining position provide sufficient shorthand for the familiar and coveted convivial gestalt. At the Lemuria and Parentalia, memo rializing the Roman dead, feasting mimed an image of life in the good old days. Drinking in the tomb (Dunbabin, The Roman Banquet [above, n. 8] ch. 4) was a special treat. Roller, who is commendably cautious about interpreting and generaliz ing, tries to identify the houses of subelites at Pompeii by their square footage (46-7) and their dining rooms by triclinia indications (three couches, some times three on a couch). Campanian dining frescoes show heterosexual and trait of Roman "libertine" reality. Jane Whitehead, "The Cena Trimalchionis and biographical narrative in Roman Middle-Class art," in P. J. Holliday, ed., Narra tive and Event in Ancient Art, ser. Cambridge studies in new art history and criti cism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993) 299-325, evokes sermo plebeius in furthering R. Bianchi Bandinelli's construct of a concomitant ars ple beia. See the latter's "Arte plebea," Dialoghi di Archeologia 1 (1967) 7-19. Trimal chio, however, will pop up in every discussion, faute de mieux. 18. Convivial images on sarcophagi emerge only ca. 220 CE, so Roller excludes them (26 n.29), but Dunbabin's study (above, n. 8) extends well into the Christian ban quet material - two chapters on late and last banqueteers. 19. Petersen corrects or at least seriously complicates typical views of the freedman subelite in Roman art and art history that are based on Petronius' comic but sav age burlesque. The relation between Trimalchio and Nero already complicated the issue of Petronius' targets. Indeed, Nero reclined when he attended bloody amphitheatrical events (Suet. Nero 12.3). 20. A Rhodian funeral altar (ca. 125; Dunbabin, The Roman Banquet [above, n. 8] fig. 83) shows a grieving woman next to an indecorous drunken banqueter sprawled on his couch with dangling cup and with the one "elbow up behind head" con vention to indicate a figure entirely intoxicated. This reductio ad absurdum, un expected on a personal memorial, could still apply to both readings of Dead Drinkers.</page><page sequence="8">Review Articles 625 perhaps homosexual (certainly homosocial) couples in such rooms, perhaps portrayed precisely on the walls of rooms chosen for dining. Many rooms in a Pompeian house could serve this purpose, once the right furniture was brought in. Mixed couples are the Campanian standard. With two important exceptions, only men recline at Trimalchio's splashy convivium.21 Roller agrees that hosts usually invited down; that is, their guests were their client es or oth ers beholden to them. These paintings are more grandiose material fantasies than the funerary monuments; they exhibit luxury rooms and products some times presumably beyond the purchase of those who commissioned them. These images were available for guests to spin ecphrastic narratives, follow ing Clarke's analysis (Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans [above, n. 8] ch. 8). A very few show tipsy revelers falling over or passed out (pi. II, III, V; cf. Suet. Claud. 8.33) - a story or stories lie behind this, not just an idealized image of a happy dead soul. Nilotic Pygmies dining or having sex constitutes a sepa rate category for Roller and Clarke, a parody of actual Italian people in actual spaces. Images of lovemaking appear inset in some larger images of love making in rooms that Italians may have employed for lovemaking (78). Much uncertainty remains about this aspect of subelite identity formation, but Roller argues that the "grand houses" do "not display the pattern of usage identified earlier for subelite houses" - especially pictures of reclining dining (83). Roller provides a valuable appendix arguing that no style of sedentary drinking party called commissatio ever existed, that in Italy food generally ac companied drink, and that commissatio describes a more active reveling through the streets, before or after attendance at a reclining convivium in a din ing room (68,181-8). When Roller examines the four most extensive, extant ac counts of Roman conviviality,22 he reports that trays and food courses always accompany the wine. The commissatio, however, describes negatively deca dent and immoderate activities, at least moderately transgressive behavior, rather than normative practice. The Romans liked to refer to the prisci mores parentum, the Romulean aurea aetas, and their like - the remote if vague period when all men were brave and women properly behaved themselves - sitting at the banquet, for example. Roller argues that a buttoned-up ideology was useful for moralists and anti quarians (Var. Antiq. fr. 30a = Isid. Etym. 20.11.9; Val. Max. 2.1.2), and for no bles and freedmen to contrast to the "bad new days." Either the days of yore never existed or the female sitting habit was quaint already by Plautus' day, if one may judge anything by noble Alcmena's dinner with Jupiter/ Amphit ryo in eodem lecto (Amph. 800-11 at 805). Roller does not address the fact that no other guests were present for this welcome home love feast, even if we ac cept the Plautine scene as totally Roman (100-3). Roller argues that women 21. Fortunata, the presumptive hostess with little to do, is the exception who proves the male rule, and Scintilla, arriving late, also gets into that envied reclining po sition. Whitehead suggested that Trimalchio's tomb statue would show him re clining on a Mine - as if at one of his beloved banquets (303, 306, ill. 87, and Sat. 71.6), or, since he wants his dog there, as on many other funeral monuments. These memorials were billboards to their munificence and prestige. Some such memorials combine ships, sigma-banquets, and even the grotesque Nilotic Pyg mies (e.g., ill. 90) that Clarke discusses with their stibadia for alfresco dining. 22. Plaut.

This rule continues through the Augustan period, even though women's posture - like their sexual self-control and their inclinations towards alcohol - re mains part of (censorious, male) Roman discourse. The postures of elegiac puellae, therefore, can shed no light on their social and marital status, itself a contested issue. Joint reclining on one couch, the women below the men, was the rule. This provided the ingenious lover with another Ovidian opportu nity (Ars 1.229-30): dant... aditum convivia .../ est aliquidpraeter vina quod inde petas. In Juvenal's wretched age, women recline to dine (discumbere), and do even worse. They defend Dido, philosophize, and get themselves drunk (Sat. 6.42S-56).23 In the texts, the women recline, for instance, Psyche does so with a god, Cupid (Met. 6.24: accumbebat summum torum maritus, Psychen gremio suo complexus).24 The women get their backs up into chairs, "posturing" on the freedmen's proper funerary monuments (121) of the Imperial period. Roller explains the few admitted literary exceptions, such as Milo's sitting wife in Apuleius' Metamorphoses (1.22), as exceptions that emphasize these sitting women's lack of urban elite sophistication (123). Urban women of the sube lite on stone monuments, however, recline alone or with attendants present. They position themselves thus, but rarely if a man is present (130). When the sexes appear together, the seated woman is not in reach of the wine, not cen tered in the image, and privileged only vis-a-vis servants but not the male master (as proxemic analysis shows, fig. 2 &amp; 15). This stark contrast between postures represented in elite literature and subelite monuments requires ex planation. Roller posits that the freedmen or libertini needed to emphasize, in their funerary seZ/-representation, the propriety and solidarity of their conju gal units - no convivial promiscuity or other excess for them, despite whatever the elite condescension of Petronius might allege about their inclinations (137). Where does that leave the women cavorting at drinking parties on Pom peian subelite mural decoration?25 The overtly erotic clothes (gauzy with straps slipping) and ideal somatotypes verge on the threshold of sexual trans gression.26 Very little sex takes place in the actual dining room paintings - no coitus (145), so Roller suggests that the images present "ironized, exagger ated, even parodic image[s] of certain potentialities inherent" (143) for post prandial sex with boys, girls, etc. (such as Apul. Metam. 10.20). Roller seems to mean that the painted portrayal of randy situations invites diners' attention and amusement but may restrain the actual persons from having pre- or post prandial sex (143). Such sex would be "an extreme result most unlike the nor mal unfolding of actual convivia." Pudor will trump "heightened state[s]" of arousal, after thoughtful analysis and four jugs of wine (148). Really? Roller also informs us that none of the many murals of sexual activity show "clear markers of conviviality" such as drinking cups or additional triclinium 23. Plut Mor. 619D without caricature puts the Roman host's wife (or children) next below him. 24. The dining practices of this (and other novels) deserve closer study along Roller's principles. 25.

Self-positioning tombstones emphasize the subdued pro priety of imagined antique virtue, not the sexual excess of murals, or even the normal subelite woman's reclining while dining, as her "betters" did. The age at which male children were considered adults is assumed to be ca. 15 years. Few freeborn children appear dining and reclining with adults in visual genres (158).28 The "handbook view" holds that only wearers of the toga virilis, simultaneously viewed as sexual beings, would recline (158). Roller ar gues for exceptions to that rule, such as Antonius' son Antyllus entertaining older men at Alexandria before donning the toga virilis (Plut. Ant. 28.7-12). Plutarch's source, his grandfather's doctor friend Philotas, unfortunately did not report the youth's dining posture, but he was the host. Children enjoyed only "restricted participation" at convivia to protect them when very young, to acculturate and initiate them into its sights when somewhat older (167). Normative discourse in visual and literary texts expects them to sit, if present. Roller discusses some unusual (and tendentious) passages concerning the per haps exceptional behavior of Verres' son (Cic. Verr. 2.3.23,2.5.81), young Nero and Britannicus (Tac. Ann. 13.15), and Petronius' tale of the Pergamene boy (Sat. 85-7). Antyllus, likewise, was in an exceptional position, in his exalted fa ther's absence, so it is not surprising if, hosting a banquet, he were "re hearsfing] the role of the socially dominant adult host... [he] would shortly become" (174), had he been allowed to live. Thus, Roller has made a good case that reclining dining posture connoted "social privilege, leisure, luxury, and pleasures ... associated with elite adult males" (175). Sitting and standing were "degrees of detraction from that leisure" (177), the latter a posture of instrumentality, also known as serving, a slavish condition. The student of nonverbal behaviors benefits from Roller's study of the hierarchy of postures. Not absolute elevation,29 but "relative states of relaxation and tension" (178) mark superior status, proxemic superiority. The freedmen seem inclined to the biographical mode in their funeral monu ments. All Romans and wanna-be Romans seem obsessed by banqueting pro tocols, and that fascination and snobbishness have not disappeared. The 27. Roller admits that two large scenes, from the Villa Famesina and the Villa at Cen tocelle, discussed in Clarke (Looking at Lovemaking: Constructions of Sexuality in Roman Art [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998] 93-107, esp. ill. 29-30) seem to contradict this claim, and certainly many drinking vessels show sex scenes (145 and n.113). Pygmies can do anything, though, as Clarke's latest book, discussed below, makes clear. Their non-ideal figures make them one "designated vehicle ... for parody and satire" (146). The caricatures of the antics of these macromastic, steatopygic, and macrophallic somatotypes (Clarke 1998: 43) pro vide a comic foil for other, serious business in the "house of the doctor" at Pom peii. 28.

John R. Clarke has captured several corners in Roman visual culture where ar chaeology, art history, and literature intersect. He digs trenches in its best-at tested third of a millennium (100 BCE-CE 250). He now explores syzygies of "humor, power, and transgression in Roman visual culture, [nominally] 100 BC-AD 250." His texts mostly date between 60 BC and AD 79. Now "with Roman eyes and ears" (132), we are "looking at laughter" - an unintended synaesthesia. The handsome University of California Press volume revisits considerable material that Clarke had already examined in earlier studies for other purposes. Clarke's earlier books discussing ordinary Romans and their representations of sexual pleasures30 introduced us to much material subver sive and frequently unromantic. Reflection "required [yet] another book" (2). Clarke divides this book into three parts: visual, social, and sexual humor. These categories overlap. Laughter is a difficult matter to analyze, whether humorous, cruel, or in sane. Crude obscenities can be more or less funny than exquisite, erudite ob jets d'art. The slippage between narrower elite and broad, vulgar tastes, and between ancient conceptions and modern preconceptions, requires sensitive discrimination. We don't get the amusement from cripples, freaks, and dwarfs that Juvenal and perhaps our great grandparents did. Res ridiculosae, ioci, face tiae, and laughter pervade ancient Roman life - the lawcourt, the banquet, the stage, the triumph,31 and even more religious rituals.32 Spectators at the am phitheaters observed metatheatrical "staged" bloodied executions with crim inals performing mythical roles such as the judgment of "Paris" (cf. Apul. Met. 10.29-35) and the sparagmos of "Orpheus." It is not clear that these fatal mimes seemed "farcical" to the spectators, although they were "entertainments" (23 4), as Kathleen Coleman has shown.33 Clarke too briefly adumbrates a clutch of psychological, sociological, and philosophical theories of humor (3-9) before applying Bakhtin's fruitful liter ary theory of carnivalesque topsy-turveydom (e.g., the Lupercalia) to his vi 30.

It recalls Michael Grant's Eros at Pompeii (London: Oc topus, 1975; repr. New York: Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, 1997) and Catherine Johns' wider-ranging Sex or Symbol. Erotic Images of Greece and Rome (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1982). Clarke knows Corbeille's 1996 study (above, n. 16) of Roman laughter, but their oratorical and visual data bases rarely overlap. 31. Now see Mary Beard, The Roman Triumph (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007). Clarke, an art historian, accepts the received lacunose story of the tri umph as transmitted archaic ritual (e.g., taunts and inversions). Beard's book calls into question nearly all Handbook wisdom concerning the spottily attested events of triumphs. 32. Cic. de orat. 216-89; Petr.

Clarke finds the Russian literary Formalist's concepts of inver sion and burlesque, indeed grotesque, useful for understanding Roman, Pom peian, and Ostian senses of visual humor. The approach is promising, although the theories are suggestively rather than rigorously applied. Reversals of class values (then, if not now) decorated semi-public bars, baths, latrines, and even bedrooms and dining rooms in private houses. Clarke notably and intelli gently seeks out images whose original contexts are preserved or at least recorded. Clarke approaches humor sociologically, examining the humorist, his au dience, the butt, and the reception of the "joke," when possible (5). Mikhail Bakhtin's concepts of inversion and transgression, upper and lower body strata activities, provide useful tools for explaining frequent reversals in Roman visual spectacles, both the live ones (staged, triumphs, gladiatorial combats) and the fixed (paintings, statues, reliefs, etc.). Clarke consequently believes that Roman visual humor is more subversive than supportive of pre vailing power structures (8), a counter-intuitive thought that requires more argument than Clarke offers. Since others, following Bakhtin, have argued that comic inversions both loosen and reinforce social hierarchies (e.g., N. Z. Davis, Society and Culture in Early Modern France [Cambridge: Cambridge Uni versity Press, 1987]), no simple hermeneutic emerges - because humor is "con text sensitive." The ludicrous problems deserve Clarke's responsible attempts to ascertain for each image the patron, artist, viewer, and original location (10), four difficult questions. Pompeii, Ostia Antica, Rome, and the Rhone valley (for some later ceramics) provide most of his contextualized material, some of it from latrines and taverns, some of it found on and in tombs and temples. Clarke follows Anthony Corbeill in emphasizing Roman anxiety about masculinity and its delicate balances (18).34 Clarke emphasizes the primacy of images for Romans, recalling their affection for mimes and public executions carried out as mythological scenic farces, e.g., Daedalus crashing down into the amphitheater, Orpheus being mauled by bears, and even Pasiphae (Mart. Lib. Sped. 5) split apart from the crotch by sex with a real bull. The stage's stu pidi and the arena's criminals act out spectacles of their terminal humiliation for audiences, far beyond the dreamy (and usually not farcical) Campanian murals that he cites as parallels (25, statistics for the mythological paradigms). The identification of humor must often remain uncertain for later epochs. Clarke finds the vigilant dogs of Campania's entry way mosaics funny, and reminds us of Encolpius' drunken double-take (Sat. 29.1-2). Proceeding from "unswept floor" and "skeletons partying" mosaics, Clarke advances to an Aquileian relief of Jupiter hurling a thunderbolt at a defecating man (60-2). This image, dubiously read as an admonition, also has both a Petronian an tecedent (Sat. 71.20) and rather many posted public notices: defense de defequer or Cacator cave malum. Clarke perceives many examples of Roman visual humor as a form of building proprietors' psychological warfare. He suggests that humorous 34.

The fascinum - originally a spell but then a phallic object - provided powerful charms (69), with or without dangling bells attached. Clarke boldly argues that the handsome Aethiops and the dwarfish and grotesque Pygmaios were later inventions in Roman psychological history to "merge the fascinum with human bodies" (73). "Naughty pygmies" may protect shortly vulnera ble defecators in the Ostian Baths of Neptune (II, 4,2), the customers' orifices briefly open, as in the experience of the dangerous sneeze (78).35 Clarke pro vides other examples (80-1): defecators and protectress Fortuna at Pompeii, and transgressive but apotropaic pygmies in other latrines at Pompeii and Timgad. Chapter two on "Comic Theater" discusses masks in theaters and houses at Pompeii. Transgressive scenes abound, from comedy and tragedy as in the House of Theatrical Pictures (I, 6,11); informal graffiti feature peculiar faces and words. Clarke claims to view these once ordinary scenes as Italian view ers did, not as "omniscient scholar-viewers ... [see these images and now offer anachronistic] erudite interpretations" (83). This preference creates a quickly demolished straw man. The Aithiops, once merely "other" (e.g., at Palestrina's Nile mosaic) or exotic, at least from the time of Octavian's defeat of the Egyptians (and Antony) at Actium in 31 BCE became ludicrous, clown-like, and not least macrophallic - often cheerfully dancing, urinating, ejaculating, and/or defe cating (91, House of the Sculptor VII, 7, 24). They scamper, caper, and even re-enact a burlesque of the judgment of Solomon at the House of the Doctor (Plates 4-8) -an allegedly "sophisticated parody" of the Hebrew tale (102). Elsewhere, deformed pygmies wander through sacral African landscapes for the amusement of Italian owners and guests: "hilarious" parody, Clarke claims (107). Clarke explores different groups and audiences ("class conflict") in chap ter 6. A drinker's haven with an outdoor image of an ass mounting a lion sup plies a useful test case (PI. 11, Pompeian Tavern: VII, 6, 34-5). Is it an esoteric reference to an historical anecdote,36 a reference to an "Aesopian" animal fable but one not recorded in ancient texts, or a "site-specific" image? Using draw ings and descriptions made in 1855, when this building was unearthed, and a facade with a parallel program, Clarke produces a reconstruction that re places the painting in its find spot (fig. 51). Clarke argues for propitious, or 35. On the poetics of sneezing, see A.S.

That is, they intend to encourage hope of wine, women, and winning at games of chance. But, this Mercury's moneybag is empty - an inversion - and similarly the ass unexpectedly treads the lion. The ensemble of the three images thus suggests to "New Art History" (120) that these im ages' meaning depend on the viewer's own experience, not a canonical inter pretation by a licensed interpreter from the educated elite. You never know what will happen in a tavern. Clarke turns to another town and another drinking-hole, the Ostian Tav ern of the Seven Sages. Here an ensemble juxtaposes one higher level of philosophers with a lower level of perhaps once as many as twenty-four men seated on a latrine bench.37 Both those painted sets of characters above and below comment on passing wind and bowel movements, but those above are labeled in Greek and speak in meter, while those below produce vulgar chat ter, feces, and urine (125-31). Clarke moves from lower to upper echelons in ch. 7, from tavern to the large "House of the Menander" (1800 m2). Paintings there mock the physiques of Greek gods and heroes.38 For example, one finds Aphrodite and Theseus caricatured by doll figures. Aeneas and Romulus appear at Pompeii in both heroic and parodic form - even dog headed (Fullonica of Ululitremulus, ex terior, and Masseria di Cuomo, interior, figs. 72-3, plates 16-17). Clarke sees anti-Roman and anti-Augustan resentment in the dual spoof, but given the ubiquity of comic images that he has collected, caution seems advised.39 Artists and patrons may be more interested in mockery of the "classics" than in political comment. The same problem arises when one sees "Hercules and Omphale" as equivalent to intentional parodies of Antony and Cleopatra.40 The double transvestism41 has multiple meanings, but the further the fresco's date from pre-Actium propaganda, the less persuasive or timely the "joke." Clarke dates the painting of this Pompeian Fourth Style semi-public image in the house of M. Lucretius (IX, 3, 5) to after 62 CE, perhaps a hundred years after the point had gone stale. 37. See A. Koloski-Ostrow, "Finding Social Meaning in the Public Latrines of Pom peii," in N. de Haan and CM. Jansen, eds., Cura Aquarum in Campania, Bulletin antieke beschaving 4 (Leiden: Stichting Babesch,1996) 79-86, or idem, ed., Water Use and Hydraulics in the Roman City (Dubuque: Kendall/Hunt, 2001) for surveys of Roman hydraulics and toilet science. 38. Clarke notes (146) that the paintings never parody native Roman deities, but Ro bigus hardly lends himself to anthropomorphic caricature - even on 25 April. 39. Augustus had parodied Olympians at banquet - with Augustus himself parad ing as his patron deity, Apollo (Suet. Aug. 70.1). The Lectisternia were also pro faned. 40. Clarke 173, follows Paul Zanker, Augustus und die Macht der Bilder (Munchen: CH.

The advertisement should prepare viewers for part HI, sexual humor?although Roman obscenity pervades these pages. Erotic images record 'the sexual act itself without shame or blame" (164). This claim is not always true for the ludicrous images collected here, though. His Ovidian epigraph caps the story of Mars and Venus' adultery and Vulcan's entrapment of them for their blame and shame {turpiter, turpis; Met. 4.188-9: superi risere diuque/ haec fuit in toto notissima fabula caelo). Divine dal liances, however, certainly did not license or approve Oscan humans engag ing in bestial sex (168: swan, bull, wooden cow) and other improprieties. Clarke ponders the sleeping Hermaphroditi, the bisexual beings that af ford at best a gamey humor "about... genitals and gender" (180). Others may find the amusement lame, but Clarke argues that this creature protected its stymied viewers because its physiological surprises led them to apotropaic laughter.42 He deems laughter "a powerful good-luck charm" (184). Clarke identifies a furtive sacrificer to Priapus as impotent and foolish (185, PI. 21: Villa Myst. cubiculum 4, east wall of north alcove) -1 don't see why. Clarke describes giant penile freaks' aggressive poses - Priapus himself and Mercury - as salubrious and "intrinsically funny and apotropaic" (189). Perhaps he means that normal men (and women?) would envy their gross deformity, un like the illustrated "poet" afflicted by a pathologically enlarged scrotum (PI. 108: Suburban Baths, dressing room 7, scene 8). The climax in chapter 9 con cerns the depiction of human sex. Clarke rapidly reviews breaches of Roman erotic decorum.43 He analyzes deftly taboo sex acts in dressing room 7 of Pom peii's Suburban Baths (194-216, figs. 95-109). If the dressing room (for men and women) is a place of danger (an Evil, or a too friendly, eye), Clarke claims that the "naughty locker labels" (195) may arouse anxious bathers' success fully apotropaic, even prophylactic laughter. Clarke has created impressive digital reconstructions of men and the images painted in that risky room. Enthusiasm arguably carries Clarke away in his ecphrastic analysis of scenes 3 and 4. We do not see a fellated man hiking up his tunic or the fella trix's "expected reluctance" to perform. We have no evidence that he is an "in tellectual" (one scroll in a hand can mean many things) or that fellation was "difficult to obtain" (196-7). The scenes are anciently pornographic, arguably, but I don't experience "side-splitting parody" (201X44 much less sexual arousal. The scenes include larger sexual groups with recliners, kneelers, and acrobatic tribads assuming indelicate and humorously awkward postures. Back at Salvius' downscale bar (fig. 54), Clarke attempts to identify portray als of effeminate fellows, cinaedi. Two men's rotund bodies, crossed ankles, dress, hair, and their feckless verbal and gestural interchange with a barmaid 42. Johns, Sex or Symbol (above, n. 30) 104-5 considered many of these issues. 43. Clarke, discussing (192-3) active and passive roles in Rome and Washington, D.C., forgets that both William Clinton and Monica Lewinsky violated Roman rules of "oral purity." The mouth is a busy, multitasking social and sexual organ. Some times, as Freud (allegedly?) implied, a cigar is not just a cigar. See Corbeille, Con trolling Laughter (above, n. 16) 249: Index, s.v. Mouth. 44. Clarke's enthusiasm leads him to discern items in pictures that cannot be found, or to interpret damaged images plausibly but beyond the evidence (e.g., Fig. 66, Pasiphae's invisible "cow").</page><page sequence="16">Review Articles 633 might support this interpretation of sexual inversion, especially in compari son to five other more "macho" men in the three other, contiguous frames. The male clientele presumably would enjoy images of both "straight" coun terparts dicing, wenching, and drinking, while a woman - a barmaid and a servant at that - puts down these blatant homosexuals!45 Another interesting question about Roman visual humor: if "the only way to maintain a position of superiority [towards frowned-upon sexual acts on Roman walls] is to laugh at the image" (231), then the patrons of the painters, who are the exhibitors of the images, are policing their guests, forc ing them to endorse their own sexual values. Then laughter serves as an in strument of control more than of release, a common mode of Mediterranean manipulation. In the novels of Petronius and Apuleius, the laughter of char acters certainly serves this purpose in scenes of humiliation too numerous to catalogue here.46 Clarke appends a coda on Rhone Valley relief medallions (215-27). They provide some rare and desirable post-Pompeian, Gallic comparanda, images and even some texts (e.g., the cryptic fig. 110, inscribed BENE FUTUO, VOLVI ME; fig. 114: VIDES QUAM BENE CHALAS). Virtuosic sexual postures of un expected agility and dexterity delight the unoffended eye the more, when artists add acrobatic elasticity or incongruity to the salacious mix. Clarke does not explore the psychodynamics of visual copulatory humor beyond noting violations of taboo and the endless pleasures of transgression (226,231). These objects, unimpressive pots and lamps, were portable, so their original Sitz im Leben remains unclear. Food and sexuality have always been good to think with. Each has its special postures, gestures, vocabulary47 and tabus. The Romans sometimes combined them in ingenious ways that produced pleasure or pain for partic ipants and observers. The Romans praised and blamed both frugality and lav ish hospitality; they idealized and enjoyed both parsimony and excess in consuming pleasures of the flesh. If one contrasts prandium and cena, the for mer may be characterized as frugal, restorative, daily routine, isolated, and it is experienced upright for the purpose of essential nourishment. The latter supplies luxury, inessential festivity, conviviality, and it is experienced while reclining for the purpose of pleasure 48 45. Clarke casually broaches the topic of humor in contemporary pornography (214 15). He finds little humor in it, but others would disagree. Of course, there are different genera of pornography designed for different purposes. 46. For examples, Garland, The Eye of the Beholder (above, n. 34), Corbeill, Controlling Laughter (above, n. 16) ch. 1, and this reviewer's article "Humiliation and immo bility in Apuleius' Metamorphoses," Transactions of the American Philological Associ ation 131 (2001)217-55. 47. The language of dining was distinguished and elegant, while that of copulating was probably low and vulgar, when not fully euphemistic, as in the peculiar con ventions of Roman elegy. 48. Cf. the structuralist essay of Florence Dupont, "Grammaire de 1'alimentation et des repas romains," in J.-L. Flandrin and M.
