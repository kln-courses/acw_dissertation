CROUSE [Ph.D.] Honorius Augustodunensis: De neocosmo: A Critical Edition of the Text with Introduction and Notes. This dissertation presents a critical edition, based on twelve manu- scripts, of the De neocosmo, a brief commentary on the creation nar- rative of Genesis. The annotations emphasize the influence of John Scotus Eriugena, and suggest certain affinities to the Platonists of Chartres. In recognition of the rhymed prose style of the work, the text is presented in the format of verse. Because of the many obscurities surrounding Honorius, the edition is furnished with a long accessus ad auctorem, in two parts. The first contains a historiographical and critical discussion of the problem of his identity, with the conclusion that there is inadequate reason for supposing his origin or place of education to have been other than that area (Southern Germany or Austria) where his mature activity was centered. The most plausible referent of "Augustodunensis" is Augs- burg; the name, "Honorius," is probably a pseudonym. The second part of the introduction deals with problems of doctrinal and literary history. There is a summary review of the tradition of hexaemeral literature, which emphasizes Eriugena and the twelfth- century revival of Platonism as factors modifying the influence of Augustine. From that standpoint, Honorius' use of his sources is dis- cussed, and the special emphasis of his interpretation of Genesis is evaluated in the context of twelfth-century humanism, especially in relation to the School of Chartres.

The Exodus material makes it clear that Midian and Israel were in close early relationship, while Exodus 18 seems to refer to the reception of Israel into an existing Midianite framework. The Numbers priestly contro- versies appear to reflect the tensions from within the Israelite com- munity produced as a result of this alignment. About iioo B.C. the Midianites were replaced by the Ishmaelites, who seem to have endured as a league until c. mid-8th century B.C. In turn they gave way to one of their number, the Qedarites, who dur- ing the Assyrian period dominated the Syrian desert confederacy of d.Atar-Samain. By the early Babylonian period the Qedarites had reached the Delta. Prominent in Nehemiah's time, they were subse- quently displaced by the Nabateans. ARLIS JOHN EHLEN [Th.D.] The Poetic Structure of a Hodayah from Qumran: An Analysis of Grammatical, Semantic, and Auditory Correspondence in IQH 3:19-36. The immediate aim of this study was to resolve the poetic structure of a single Hebrew work from the Second Temple period. The develop- ment of a methodology to trace the evolution of prosodic forms through the entire history of Hebrew literature was a more ultimate goal. The usefulness of such information for both isagogical and exegetical pur- poses is apparent. In the hope of uncovering the forgotten structural secrets of this poetic tradition, the opening chapter lays down a broad theory of poetry, drawing upon recent developments in linguistic analysis and stylistics. The characteristic effect of all poetry, it is here held, rests on parallel- ism in the broadest sense: the listener is to perceive numerous pairs and series of corresponding elements. The linguistic elements of which such pairs and series may be composed are of various kinds, but they may be classified as auditory, grammatical, and semantic. The three main chapters of the thesis trace in detail these three types of poetic correspondence as observed in a thanksgiving song from Qumran (IQH 3:19-36), which is quoted in translation and in a specially designed transliteration of the Hebrew text. The study demon- strates that the total prosodic effect of this poem cannot be adequately</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS 517 appreciated unless all three types of correspondence are taken into account as building a richly interrelated structure. WILLIAM W. EVERETT III [Ph.D.] Body Thinking in Ecclesiology and Cybernetics. Why is the human body perennially used to describe and interpret societies and superpersonal realities? What are the implications of this phenomenon of "body thinking" for theology and ethics? The thesis examines two cases of body thinking - Roman Catholic ec- clesiology and the cybernetic-general systems theory of government of Karl W. Deutsch. Catholic use of the body as a model for the church has shifted from one of "imitational causality" to one of fluid permea- tion - from an emphasis on mind to one on spirit. While the body model and its scheme of reference change, the basic symbolic importance of the body - to express the drive for human perfection - remains. Deutsch's work offers a possible new model of the body which might safeguard some Catholic reforms while retaining the themes of survival and perfection already discovered in body thinking. This cybernetic version of body thinking is explored from theological and sociological perspectives in a cross-critical fashion. Body thinking appears as a form of "rational sociality" which should be subordinated to the theo- logical concept of Kingdom. The origins of body thinking are seen to lie in the viewed leader and the necessity to integrate motivational drives and rational perception in social life. WADI' Z. HADDAD [Ph.D.] Al-Qddi Abfi Ya' 1 Ibn al-Farra': A Hanba- lite Muslim Jurisconsult and Theologian of Baghdad: His Life, Works, and Religious Thought. The thesis treats Abfi Ya'la's political, social, and intellectual and religious milieu, his family background, education, career, disciples, works, and controversy regarding anthropomorphism. It discusses Abfi Ya'la as a speculative theologian (mutakallim) and compares salient points of his theology with Mu'tazilite and Ash'arite theology. The thesis includes an Arabic edition of Kitdb al-Mu'tamad - a theological work - and a comprehensive abstract of it in English. Abfi Ya'l was a considerable force in Baghdadian society, for many years the uncontested leader of the Hanbalites, and a major factor in the resurgence of Sunni IslAm. Politically he held a pragmatic and</page><page sequence="4">518 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW quietist philosophy. Religiously his piety and rigor led him to actively combat the social evils of his society, and his position against the Shi'ites, Mu'tazilites, and Ash'arites was on several occasions vindi- cated by the Caliph. He was a prolific writer and a mujtahid. Eight of sixty-six works attributed to him survived. The discovery of Kitdb al-Mu'tamad dis- pels the myth of Hanbalite uniformity and anti-rationalism and es- tablishes him as perhaps the first Hanbalite to use the method of kaldm. His influence extended far beyond his generation through his disciples and works. JOSEPH ELMER HATHWAY [Th.D.] The Structure of the Christian's Appropriation of the Grace of God in the Church Dogmatics of Karl Barth. Using a quasi-Hegelian model of thesis-antithesis-synthesis as a com- prehensive way of stating Barth's analogical methodology, this study offers an analysis of the over-all structure of Barth's mature theology, concentrating on the function of the Holy Spirit as the power of syn- thesis throughout the structure. The study yields the following three main conclusions: i) Barth developed a theology of the appropriation of grace consistent with the over-all structure of the Church Dog- matics. 2) Yet he failed to develop the concept of the Holy Spirit in the doctrine of creation as the basis of man's self-positing over against God. This could and should be developed within a Barthian frame of reference, in order to be able to speak of man as capable of sanctifica- tion. And 3) Barth regularly excluded (and opposed) any concept of reciprocity (in the sense of interaction) between God and man. In- stead, he expressed the relation of God's action (grace) and man's response (appropriation of grace) solely in terms of parallel action. We believe that a concept of reciprocity is both an authentic element in the Christian tradition and a necessary one for developing an adequate doctrine of sanctification, which Barth failed to do. DELVIN D. HUTTON [Th.D.] The Resurrection of the Holy Ones (Mt. 27:5Ib-53): A Study of the Theology of the Matthean Passion Narrative. The account of the resurrection of the sleeping saints (Mt. 27:5Ib- 53) is the focal point for analyzing the theology of the Matthean pas- sion narrative. The methodology utilized is that of editorial criticism (Redaktiansgeschichte). Matthew's redaction of Markan material and his editorial activity in the larger blocks of peculiar tradition demon-</page><page sequence="5">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS 519 strate his understanding of Jesus' passion as inseparably bound to the establishment of the church as the eschatological people of God and to the revelation of the Son of Man at the parousia. An examination of the literary characteristics of 27:5 b-53 discloses a semi-poetic struc- ture which is modeled upon Septuagintal apocalyptic traditions. A com- parison with the empty tomb tradition in Mark and the Gospel of Peter leads to the conclusion that the resurrection of the saints was originally part of the grave-watcher cycle and belonged after 28:2-4 as the climax to the epiphany of the risen Lord to the guard at the tomb. The detailed exegetical analysis confirms the eschatological character of the tradition in its Matthean form and supports the thesis that the prodigies accompanying the crucifixion were a testimony to the escha- tological significance of Jesus' passion. Finally, the incipient theologia gloriae of Matthew's passion narrative is contrasted with the interpre- tations of Jesus' passion expressed by the other evangelists. EUGENE M. KLAAREN [Ph.D.] Belief in Creation and the Rise of Modern Natural Science: A Study in the Representative Natural Philosophy and Theology of Robert Boyle and other Seventeenth- Century Figures. This thesis aims to strengthen the argument that religion was posi- tively determinative of the rise of modern natural science. A Colling- woodian framework of systematic historical inquiry is employed in focusing attention upon mid-seventeenth-century English thought. In general, it is argued that belief in creation, including orientations to God as Creator, order in creation, and man as creature, was effectively presupposed in the new science. Specifically, a voluntarist theological orientation to creation, centered in will, power, and law facilitated the emergence of the new science over against the traditional ontological orientation to creation as nature and the enthusiastic, although short- lived, spiritualist fusion of Creator and creation in alchemy. By exam- ining Robert Boyle's theology and natural philosophy in relation to Bacon, Newton, Descartes, and the spiritualist Johan Baptist van Helmont, the critical and constructive efficacy of Boyle's representa- tive voluntarist orientation to creation is shown. Boyle manifests a religiously grounded modern structure of mind which features the critical differentiation of various disciplines and the final reality of individuals. Boyle also manifests a positive religious spirit of reform. As a totality, creation is presupposed as a legal-mechanical reality structured by the law of the great Creator and Author, which in turn orders created atoms.</page><page sequence="6">520 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ERNEST L. LASHLEE [Ph.D.] The Via Regia: A Study of Caspar Schwenckfeld's Ideas of Personal Renewal and Church Reform. The study seeks to uncover Caspar Schwenckfeld's basic vision and to trace its effects upon his life and thought by examining the his- torical development, structure, and dynamics of his ideas of personal renewal and church reform. The results of this investigation indicate that the nobleman's ideas of renewal and reform were rooted in his experience and conception of the saving presence 'of the glorified, hu- man flesh of Christ, the inhabitatio Christi in corde. Personal renewal is, he argued, a process of radical and substantial change - initiated by inner baptism, perfected through true Christian living, and consum- mated at the Last Judgment - through which the "old man" is freed from the dominion of nature and sin and transformed into a "new man" through the birth, growth, and guidance of the Christus incorda- tus. His idea of church reform was anchored to this conception of personal renewal and expressed in terms borrowed from his Christology and anthropology. The church is that band of all elect, reborn men whom Christ had foreordained to salvation and whom - after His ascent into glory - He "gathered together" under the guidance of the apostles and other Servants of the Lord. Through the sin of its minis- ters, however, the church has "fallen" and been "scattered." Only in the fullness of time - which the nobleman believed had "already be- gun" - and through the renewal of individual, reborn Christian men and a new, apostolic ministry, will God again gather a true, assembled church and restore the immediacy between Christ and His people. ELAINE H. PAGELS [Ph.D.] The Hermeneutical Debate between Origen and Heracleon in Origen's Commentary on the Gospel of John. This thesis examines those passages of Origen's Commentary on John which evince his controversy with the Valentinian theologian Heracleon over the exegesis of the Johannine gospel. It analyzes how their respective exegetical traditions are related to one another and what issues divide them. Analysis of Heracleon's position proceeds not only from the quoted fragments, but also from internal evidence of indirect quotation in Origen's Commentary. Starting from the earliest extant exegeses of the gospel of John - that of the Ophite gnostics which Hippolytus recounts - it traces the emer- gence of two conflicting exegetical traditions in the second century - the "ecclesiastical" tradition of Justin, Melito, Irenaeus, and Tertullian, based on the kerygmatic schema, and on typological methodology, on</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS 521 the one hand, and, on the other, .the so called "gnostic" interpretation developed by such circles as the Naassenes, the Peratae, and the Val- entinians. Chapters II-VI examine Heracleon and Origen's participation in this continuing theological debate. Analysis of the relevant passages indi- cates that Origen and Heracleon share, in distinction from earlier exegetes, a concern to explicate the application of the gospel writings to present experience. They disagree, however, over the fundamental theological issue that, this thesis claims, divides Valentinian theology from that of the "orthodox" - the problem of election and human freedom. Heracleon, we claim, adopts and extends the Valentinian teaching of the "elect seed," a teaching which may include a doctrine of reproba- tion. "Hylic," and "pneumatic," then, characterize not physically determined "natures" but rather topoi, that is, standpoints of man in re- lation to the divine election. Midway between these two unalterable elec- tions, according to Heracleon, stand the "psychics," to whom God has given a range of choice between salvation and reprobation. Heracleon sees the theology of the "orthodox" as the expression of this median standpoint. In exegeting John, therefore, he interprets the "Jews," the baptism of John, and the Passover as metaphors for the "orthodox," and for its practice of baptism and eucharist respectively. Heracleon offers, beyond this, his "spiritual exegesis" which applies to the elect, i.e., to the pneumatics, alone. Origen agrees with Heracleon - against, for example, Irenaeus - that traditional "ordodox" exegesis is "literalistic." He rejects, however, the Valentinian doctrine of election so emphatically, however, that he radically extends his teaching on "free will" (cf. his teaching on crea- tion and eschatology). His own "spiritual exegesis," he claims, based on the premise of free will, includes and accounts for all three levels of experience - the physical, psychic, and pneumatic - which the Valentinians had explained in terms of election doctrine. His exegesis of John, then, as well as the exegetical methods he develops, can be ac- curately understood only in the context of his historical situation and his theological controversy with the Valentinians. R. EUGENE RICE [Ph.D.] Religion, Democratic Ideology, and Change: A Study of the Traditionalistic Populism of William Jennings Bryan 1896-1925. The original purpose of this thesis was to examine the relationship between Bryan's seemingly contradictory commitment to "progressive"</page><page sequence="8">522 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW democratic reform, on the one hand, and religious fundamentalism, on the other. It soon became evident, however, that this relationship could be understood only through a careful analysis of Bryan's ideological conception of the nature and function of American democracy, and an extended examination of the interaction between politics and meaning. The democratic ideology articulated by W. J. Bryan was firmly en- sconced in the evangelical Protestant "ethos" that dominated late nine- teenth-century rural America. It was an ideology that was directly related to the populist demand for the "rule of the people," while, at the same time, being communal and religiously particularistic - we have called it a "traditionalistic populism." This religio-political conception of America as a democratic Christian nation required both relative economic equality and cultural homogene- ity. Thus, it not only provided the symbolic basis for Bryan's "pro- gressive" response to the fundamental economic strains of his time (analyzed under the rubric of class politics), but also led to his in- volvement in such divisive cultural issues as prohibition, immigration restriction, and the anti-evolution crusade. This analysis demonstrates how political action, in addition to being utilized in the defense of eco- nomic interests (class politics) and group prestige (status politics), can be employed in the maintenance, reinforcement, and defense of patterns of meaning (cultural politics). In the conclusion of the thesis the populist conception of social Christianity articulated by Bryan is contrasted with the religio-politi- cal views dominant in the two most signficant movements in American religious life during these years, the Social Gospel and Fundamentalism. JANE K. SMITH [Ph.D.] An Historical and Semantic Study of the Term "Islam" As Seen in a Sequence of Qur'dn Commentaries. Combining the historical and the semantic approaches, this essay attempts to understand what the term isldm has meant, what it now means, and whether or not there has been a change in its understanding from the time of the Prophet to the present day. The means for carry- ing out this investigation is an analysis of Qur'an commentary, con- sidering the work of one exegete representing each of the fourteen Islamic centuries. The term isldm occurs eight times in the Qur'an; this study considers what has been said in each case about the verses in question and attempts to relate the interpretation expressed to the particular historical and political circumstances out of which each author wrote.</page><page sequence="9">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS 523 Conclusions were reached in two areas. Insofar as isldm refers to the individual response of man to God, such differences as were found were insignificant and apparently unrelated to the factor of time. In its understanding as the name of a group of those who have submitted, however, there have been some significant changes in its usage, speci- fically related to historical progression. While once it referred to in- dividual and group meanings in a single expression, it has come to be used exclusively as one or the other. PETER FOX SMITH [Ph.D.] The Religious Dimension in Wagner's Art: A Study of his Parsifal. Throughout his life Richard Wagner adhered with an unwavering consistency to the essentially Romantic conviction that art was the religious experience without equal. The manifestations of this belief in the dramas which he created express the several different religious commitments that he held at various times during his life. There is in Tannhiuser and Lohengrin the mysticism of his earlier years, and the first stages of his Ring Cycle tetralogy reveal the influence which pagan thought had upon him during his days as a revolutionary. Bud- dhistic leanings are present in Tristan and Isolde, a religious national- ism is evoked in the conclusion to The Mastersingers, and a Christian aura pervades Parsifal, his final creation. Throughout his life, as well, Wagner's ideas on art (expressed in a mountain of essays and articles) correlate in a fascinating manner with his dramas. The religious dimension in these writings and in the dramas which precede Parsifal are presented in this thesis as the frame- work for the analysis of this culminating work of one who believed that in some marvelous way the sacred could live on in art through an empty and spiritless age when for some the presence of the holy could no longer be felt in more orthodox expressions of the religious experience. RICHARD E. WHITAKER [Ph.D.] A Formulaic Analysis of Ugaritic Poetry. Much of the poetry of the Hebrew Bible is believed to have been a part of an oral tradition before it was put into written form. It has been clearly demonstrated by Cassuto and others that the poetry of the Hebrew Bible represents a continuation of the poetic tradition found in the Ugaritic alphabetic texts from Ras Shamra. This thesis analyzes the Ugaritic poetry to determine whether it has</page><page sequence="10">524 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW those marks of traditional poetry which Parry and Lord recognize as the characteristics of an orally created poetry. Examining traditional usage of epithets, line patterns, formulae and clusters of formulae associated with specific themes, the thesis clearly demonstrates that the Ugaritic poetry has all of those characteristics which one would expect in an orally created poetry. The final substantive section of the thesis provides an analysis of 146 cola of a single text, noting the traditional and formulaic usage in that text and documenting the use of the formulae elsewhere in the Uga- ritic corpus. HAROLD FIELD WORTHLEY [Th.D.] The Lay Offices of the Particular (Congregational) Churches of Massachusetts, 1620-1755: An In- vestigation of Practice and Theory. In investigating the powers exercised and functions fulfilled by the ruling elders and deacons of the particular (congregational) churches of Plymouth and the Bay through the middle of the eighteenth cen- tury, this study draws data not only from the apologetic-polemic litera- ture of the times, but also from the extant running records kept by the churches during that period. The ruling eldership, originally conceived as a divinely-authorized balancing factor between clerical power and the brethren's privilege, fitted best with the comparatively modest definition of the teaching eldership common to those churches in their early exclusivist phase. After 1657, as the churches were gradually led to adopt a more inclu- sivist outlook, the ruling eldership sank into desuetude. The diaconate, originally confined to serving the tables of the Lord, the ministry, and the poor, declined in prominence as the churches in- novated by creating ad hoc prudential and disciplinary committees, the better to recognize influential non-officer members of the church and community. But by the beginning of the eighteenth century, such committees themselves had become a routine part of church organiza- tion, their membership reflecting the existence of a de facto profes- sional laity. Then the deacon qua church officer was appointed with increasing frequency to such committees, particularly those dealing with church censures, thereby laying in practice the basis for the nineteenth- century picture of the deacon as patriarchal lay minister and com- munity moralist.</page></plain_text>
