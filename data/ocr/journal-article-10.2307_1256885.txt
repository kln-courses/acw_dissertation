<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STATE CONCEPT OF IMERINA, COMPARED WITH THE THEORIES FOUND IN CERTAIN SCANDINAVIAN AND CHINESE TEXTS A paper read before a meeting of the British Association at Dundee, 1947. BY MARY DANIELLI A paper was published in 19451 in which was described the relationship of the berserks of Norse literature to the state ceremonial of the Scandi- navian chiefs and kings. It was shown that these twelve men, who appeared suddenly in the royal hall at Yule and conducted rites of initiation for young men of their own and the royal rank, were chosen from among all the initiated men of rank associated with a chief. These men often ruled their own very distant territories almost as if they were independent chiefs, but were obliged to come to their suzerain's court at special times. This organisation was not merely a Norse one, but was shared by the whole Teutonic complex of peoples and appeared to be remembered, if it was not actually practised, even in England by the Anglo-Saxon invaders, who left behind them such evidence as that of the poem " Beowulf" and perhaps, but by a different route, the later " Gawayne and the Grene Knight ", whose resemblance to the Norse stories was pointed out by Dr. Heather." The purpose of the above study was partly to show the use that could be made of the appropriate anthropological techniques in interpreting documentary evidence of certain kinds where studies in the field are not possible. In a further investigation on Chinese documents3 it has been possible to confirm and to extend the knowledge of a particular form of state concept, the barest outlines of which were given in the preliminary paper on the Scandinavian material. But the whole subject became particularly significant when it was possible to show that a form of the state idea deduced from these library studies of archaic societies was still in existence in Madagascar. Since this paper was written a preliminary investigation had been made into the situation in modern China. The results, summarised in a Note in Folk-Lore, March 1949, show that the " astrologer " or geomancer, counterpart of the " mpan- andro " in Madagascar, is still a functioning personality there also. 1 " Initiation Ceremonial from Norse Literature ".

But in the course of the investigation the author encountered Dr. M. A. Murray's work on the witch covens of western Europe4 and experienced some difficulty when considering it. Dr. Murray argues that these covens were organised in groups of twelve round a leader and had some other characteristics also found in the Scandinavian system. The Scandinavian system was, however, not an organisation of witches.5 An opportunity then followed to investigate in Madagascar an alleged N S / w BE S Diagram I : Madagascar Diagram I.

The results of this investigation6 are discussed in the present paper with relation to the ritual pattern which is its main subject. In Imerina the population is at present divided into roughly three classes, nobles or princes (Andriana), freemen (Hova), and persons of 4 The Witch Cult in Western Europe. Oxford University, 1921. 5 This situation was actually commented upon by L. W. Kingsland in a letter to Folk-Lore, to which I replied (see Correspondence, March and September 1946) briefly, because I was at the time collecting facts bearing on the situation but was still insufficiently advanced to be certain of anything except the general results to be expected. 6 A brief description of this cult is given in Folk-Lore, June, 1947 " The Witches of Madagascar: a Theory of the Function of Witches and of their Organisation based on Observations of an Existing Cult ".</page><page sequence="3">I88 The State Concept of Imerina slave descent (Hovavao). Ritually the nobles of Imerina are divided into twelve families or clans,7 each of which looks to one of twelve villages surrounding Tananarive as its place of origin, where the tomb of its founder is to be seen.8 Tananarive is the capital of Imerina and was the residence of the king with whom all twelve clans are associated. The principal Andriana of each of these families was a hereditary feudal land-owner and councillor of the king: he was supposed to assist at all the councils of the king and to sit with him in the palace courtyard to assist in the dispensation of justice. Now this, within the structure of the social pattern under discussion, is similar to the background of the berserk situation, and is defined by the specific grouping of twelve round a leader. Compare also the appearances of Odin seated in a circle with his twelve gods-councillors, each of whom was also thought of as a feudal landowner. But although the grouping is the same as that of the witch covens of Europe discussed by Dr. M. A. Murray, neither the Andriana of Madagascar nor the berserks of Scandinavia are identifiable with witches : the relationship between the two will be returned to later in the paper when the state pattern has been described. In theory the twelve Andriana villages were orientated round Tanana- rive according to a strict theoretical pattern. A similar pattern is given in a Scandinavian document of about the eleventh century A.D. which purports to give the history of the settlement of Iceland. This island was occupied mainly by groups of chieftains and their dependents who pre- ferred flight and the taking up of a new life abroad to submitting to one of their number who had determined to become king of all Norway. The arrangement of the document itself9 is peculiar: it divides Iceland into quarters; beginning in the east, continuing through the south and west to the north, it describes the settlement of each quarter as being under the headship of one particularly illustrious man or woman, after whom the people of the quarter appear all to have been regarded as if they were 7When these clans are named by Malagasy they usually number six : probably each clan is divided into two for the purposes of the theory, to correspond with day and night, sun and moon etc. There is no confusion about the supposed number of Andriana villages, which is twelve. 8 See diagram I. Tananarive is not the first capital of Imerina, which was at Ambohimanga and with which a continuous connection was maintained. Hence the Andriana may actually have been transferred from one set of villages to an- other : this may be one of the reasons why only some of these twelve villages can actually be pointed out in the environs of Tananarive, losses or confusion having occurred in this process. Such transferrings may have happened so often that agreement between the theory and practice is not expected and may even never have existed. 9 The Libellus Islandorum.

Now each of these quarters was divided into three sections, each section being ruled by a single magistrate. These sections were called Things, and they were local law-courts, each of which supplied a given number of men to the annual national meeting known as the Allthing. In fact these twelve local courts were placed round the coasts of Iceland,12 more or less N N I . . I i I ii 1S Diagram 2: Iceland Diagram 3: Madagascar Diagram 2. This diagram illustrates the theoretical situation described in the Libellus Islandorum. In theory the Icelandic plan was based on the typical four-sided dwelling hall: hence the diagram is constructed as a square. Each of the four sections, north, south, east and west was known as a quarter. The intersections of the square in continuous lines are explained in the accompanying text.

The Allthing was the equivalent of the king's court in a kingless country, where all quarrels between quarters and sections in the 10 See diagram 2. 11 Translations of portions of this work are to be found in vol. i of the Origines Islandicae. 1 1There appear in fact to have been four Things in the northern quarter, owing to the development of a feud between two halves of one of them: but this was felt to be anomalous and only three Things were represented at the Allthing.</page><page sequence="5">Ig9o The State Concept of Imerina quarters were dealt with by the heads of all the local courts, the twelve Things, sitting together under the substitute for the king, the Lawspeaker. Theoretically this annual meeting was in the centre of Iceland, and it can be seen therefore from the following paragraph that this is another resemblance between the Icelandic and the Malagasy systems. When the Icelanders met at the Allthing, the pattern of the concept of the state was reproduced by the setting up of a temporary town, such that all the people from the north quarter had camps in the northern part and in the vicinity of their own chiefs, i.e. the twelve magistrates, and so on, and the area seems to have been rather elaborately laid out for this purpose. Schematically this arrangement reminds us of that in diagram I. In Imerina, not only do the Malagasy think always in terms of north, south, east and west where we think of right hand and left hand but, from the proximate to the most distant, directions are always given in this way: the world is seen as orientated round some central object. What this object is depends, of course, on the occasion: it may be two persons who are discussing the direction of a journey, it may be a whole village in relation to other villages, or it may be the fireplace of the house to the north or east of which a man has left the hat he sends his child to seek.13 Hence, in any given case, we have four directions crossing one another at a given point, and whose equal extent from that point can be limited at any desired position.14 If the limitation is made sufficiently wide, the whole world may be included within its borders. But this system of thought has a focus : the dwelling house, and from a study of this more details of the scheme can be learned. The house is traditionally orientated so that the wall in which the door is placed faces west: hence the other walls face north, east and south.15 In old-established villages, particularly those which stand within the old fortifications, there are still no exceptions to this rule. All such houses have been established with a foundation rite 13 It is still customary in China to refer to direction in this way (Prof. Walter Anderson: personal communication). Dr. Arne Runeberg of Helsinki gave us the following information from his own region: " The Aland islanders are commonly known to use the concepts ' north ', ' south ' etc. in cases where other people would express themselves in terms of right, left, in front of, etc. : e.g. ' he is sitting east of us ', ' the south end of the table ' etc." He quotes also a story that when God had created the Jutlander, he asked at once " where is north, where is south and where is my foodbag? " and the Jutlander's expression of self-confidence " Here is north, here am I, and here is my foodbag." In the same way a know- ledge of his orientation is essential to a Malagasy, cf. the final page of my paper op. cit., note 24. 14 See diagram 3. 15 The walls of the house are one form of limitation or boundary described in the above text, so that the argument may be followed on diagram 3. But compare this with diagrams I and 5.</page><page sequence="6">The State Concept of Imerina 1 9 performed by a special officer, the "mpanandro", maker of days. This is the geomancer, sometimes called " astrologer". He measures out the foundations of the house on a piece of ground chosen according to certain rules of his profession, places the corner positions in the intermediate cardinal points, and by means of diagonals joining these positions marks the centre.16 In some or all of these five positions offerings are laid beneath the ground. But the meaning of what the " mpanandro " does is profound: in these acts he is a creator, a beginner of undertakings. In general, apart from the founding of houses, he has to see that anything one of his consultants undertakes is begun on a day which will start him well : and if ill-luck follows in spite of his advice another man must be consulted. The "mpanandro" is, as his title indicates, the maker of time. The ritual calendar is in his hands, and thus he is the supreme official to everyone in the community.

This illustrates the procedure of the " mpanandro " in founding a house. The crosses mark the four corner positions (the continuous lines being the walls) and the centre (the discontinuous lines being the diagonals used to find this. Diagram 5. This is drawn after the diagram in the " Tantara ny Andriana " There is no reason why the diagram should not have been drawn as a square, which is the normal shape of an old Malagasy one-roomed house. The diagram is slightly simplified, the names are given in English instead of in Malagasy, and the month names are omitted, their order in the year being substituted: the position of the names as they appear on the original diagram has been preserved in this numbering. Diagram 6. This has been slightly simplified from Legge's diagram (Yueh Ling, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxvii). The outer frame is a representation of the " four seas ". This is perhaps comparable with the deep fosse surrounding Malagasy towns, with entrances at two or four of the cardinal points of the compass. Both Malagasy and Scandinavian schemes are supposed to be sur- rounded by seas : in fact, of course, since they are islands, both are surrounded by sea: but this is an accident so far as the ritual is concerned. It is simply part of the ritual theory to conceive of the territory involved as though it were an island. 16 See diagram 4.</page><page sequence="7">192 The State Concept of Imerina without his having begun it, including the commencement of the day itself. When he orientates a house in the manner described, he does not establish merely a house, a structure of bricks and wood : he sets time in motion for the person who is going to occupy the house, normally a young man recently married who is beginning his independent existence, and it is a deliberate part of the " mpanandro's " intention that the calendar should be arranged round its four walls, as it is that the house itself should be arranged in conformity with the idea of space (see diagrams 2, 3, 4) and with the state concept (see diagram I). In the collection of legendary and historical documents known as the " Tantara ny Andriana " there appears a diagram of the arrangement of the months round a room," and I was myself shown the same system by several " mpanandro " in Imerina at the present time. The room is shown divided into quarters by means of diagonals drawn through the intermediate cardinal points, with the centre specially marked,18 and the year is shown, as is the division of Iceland in the Scandinavian scheme, to begin in the east. There are three months marked to each of the four quarters, so that the quarters themselves can relate either to time or to space or, since the kingdom of Imerina was itself divided into four quar- ters,19 to the state concept. Therefore whichever of these three is taken (e.g. mentioned in course of discussion, etc.), it must be assumed that the others are also implied; and this is a fact which must never be lost sight of in assessing Malagasy thought processes.20 It was mentioned on p. 19o and illustrated in diagram 3, that the scheme for Madagascar is an expandable one: it may be applied at any desired centre and may reach as far from this as desired. If a diagram of the scheme is constructed for Iceland, the same observation applies. The small inner square of discontinuous lines in diagram 2 represents the theoretical position of the Allthing in relation to Iceland itself (repre- 17 Published in Tananarive by the Imprimerie Officielle, 19o8. A " tantara " is a history of a clan from its mythical beginnings to the latest migration and present situation of any particular family bearing the clan name. 18 The verbal description of the Malagasy scheme is attached to the person of the creator king, the founder of the unified state of Imerina, Andrianampoinimer- ina, who codified the laws. The name is a title rather than a personal appellation, and means " the prince in the centre of Imerina ". 19 According to the " Tantara ny Andriana ". On the strength of this statement diagonals dividing the plan into quarters are added to diagram I. 20 This remark applies only, of course, within the limits of the present argument. It does not necessarily follow that because a Pueblo Indian marks out his cere- monial ground in four quarters that he makes the same implications from this as does a Malagasy. It is probable that the Icelander and the Chinese of the relevant periods did do so, but this can only be stated because it has been shown that there is in these cultures evidence for the existence of the whole scheme.</page><page sequence="8">The State Concept of Imerina I193 sented by the continuous square). If we also use evidence which can be supplied from the mythology, we find that the conception of the whole world is also constructed on the same lines. This has been expressed in diagram 2 by drawing in the outermost square of discontinuous lines. There is, of course, no fixed measurement or scale in the drawing of these diagrams (2, 3): the squares are drawn at random on the diagonals, only their relative distance from the centre being known. The annual meeting at the Allthing of the twelve chief magistrates or local rulers of Iceland, who were at the same time descendants of Norwegian princely houses, for the purpose of dispensing justice to the assembled representatives of the whole country may be roughly compared in some ways2' to the principle of the meeting of the Malagasy feudal lords at the court of the sovereign for the same purpose. There was no king in Iceland, but his place among the twelve was taken by a thirteenth individual known as the Lawspeaker, since part of his duties was to recite at the Allthing the code of Icelandic law (he was, in fact, largely chosen for his knowledge of this-knowledge which seems in turn to have been largely correlated with illustrious descent). The Lawspeaker presided over the twelve and their assistants, and from his knowledge of the law and with the advice of the meeting pronounced final judgment in the cases. At these meetings the calendar for the coming year was announced, and when necessary amended, but no details seem to be available of how this was done, so that the specific pattern of the time concept is in this case not fully demonstrable. If, however, earlier research is correct in visualising the ritual as the performance of an annual seasonal cycle, then the twelve gods would fall readily into their places as the twelve months, and the twelve chiefs would derive from this. The chief god of the Scandinavians before the settlement in Iceland was Odin, who sat at the head of a council of twelve gods to give judgment to his people. It can be shown that the Scandinavian chief and his twelve berserks were equivalent in ritual to Odin and these twelve gods, and it can be shown that his hall was the ceremonial centre of the chief's life, just as Valhall was the centre of Odin's administration, berserks on the one hand and gods on the other taking part in initiating candidates for admission to the ceremonies. This is to say that the focus of the organ- isation built on the theoretical pattern of twelve assistants to a chief is in Scandinavia, as in Madagascar, the dwelling house. And both the 21 But it is not suggested that if the legal systems as a whole in their day-to-day application were compared, they would be found to be identical in the two cultures.</page><page sequence="9">194 The State Concept of Imerina Scandinavian and the Malagasy ruler were obliged to begin a reign with the construction of a hall or palace for themselves whether or not they then proceeded to live in it. Further, each of the twelve Scandinavian gods, Odin's councillors, was the ruler of a territory, and the owner him- self of a hall or house surrounding the lands and hall of Odin himself, reminding us of the scheme shown in diagram I. It may be suggested that the relation of these territories and dwellings to those of Odin was similar to that of the twelve magistrates of Iceland, with their halls and lands, to the central temple and sacred ground of the Allthing. And if this was the case, then the pattern is similar to that of the twelve Andriana villages of Imerina surrounding the capital Tananarive. The Allthing was instituted only after long consultations over the traditional methods of government, and the despatch at the expense of the community of a man to make specific observations upon them in the land from which the Icelanders had brought them. It was not, in fact, an invention, but a modification of the traditional Norwegian concept. But the king of Imerina was thought to be protected by twelve king- gods-not anthropomorphic and four of them, perhaps gods of the quarters, were more important than the rest-who were connected in- directly with the cardinal points,22 and therefore with the space concepts of the Malagasy and with the rest of the scheme. Unfortunately it has not been possible to discover the connection between the worshippers of a particular god or idol and their social status or geographical situation. This part of the system was deliberately destroyed in 1869 and an intensive special study would be needed before it could be re-constructed in detail. The gods were housed in villages surrounding Tananarive, at least in theory, and this suggests a link with the comparable theory of the twelve villages. It is tempting to suggest that in the last resort each of the Andriana clans associated itself with one of these gods, particularly since the first Andriana of Imerina were the sons of its first king,23 just as the twelve Scandinavian gods are said to have been the sons of Odin, who was regarded not only as a god but as the first king of his people. There existed in the ritual of Scandinavia and throughout the Teutonic 22 By the fact that each had one day of a month as his own on which his ad- herents did no work : as already shown each month in Madagascar has a position relative to the cardinal points. 23 The king in Imerina was regarded and addressed as a visible god during the period of his reign. The first king of Imerina, Andrianampoinimerina, was not, however, the originator of the system: an earlier ruler is said to have founded the custom of the sovereign's taking twelve wives and probably he him- self merely modified an existing custom.</page><page sequence="10">The State Concept of Imerina 195 area, apparently linking Odin with his twelve gods,24 the idea of a trilogy of important gods including Odin himself. This trilogy was carried into the state concept. In all the local courts in Iceland described above it was for instance obligatory for the presiding magistrate to be assisted by two others. This trilogy links up with a ritual conception of the universe as being divided into three sections: these are Heaven, with which man's soul, literally a portion of the wind, his breath, and the time computations of the ritual calendar based on observations of the heavenly bodies, are connected: Earth, with which man's body, the territorial division and orientation and the products of the land are connected: and Air, by which is denoted living man, breath and body joined together governing the land and making it produce what man needs. For Scandinavia, apart from these suggestions, there is little to show how these ideas worked out in the structure of society. But in Imerina the "mpanandro ", the maker of days or astrologer, is the representative of Heaven. The representative of Earth is the " mpisikidy ", or witch doctor as we usually understand the term, who is consulted when misfortune falls upon oneself or one's undertakings : a relationship actually exists between the witch doctor and the witches (evil) which is not in any way possible to the representative of Heaven. The representative of Air, or man himself, is the holder of the title Andriamanitra i.e. anyone in a ceremonial situation who, in virtue of his authority, even if he is no more than a simple house- holder, has to consult either of the other members of the trilogy.25 Turning now to China: the gist of the scheme is contained in a diagram supplied by Legge.26 Diagram 6, which is simplified from a Chinese original, is in illustration of the text which it accompanies in the Book of Rites. It is said to be a plan of an imperial palace. The focus of the scheme is therefore shown from the outset, as in Madagascar, to be the dwelling house. In Legge's diagram no diagonals dividing it into 21 The trilogy appears to be variously made up, but usually is composed of Odin and two of the twelve gods. The idea of the trilogy arises eventually from Scandinavian (or Teutonic) mythology where it is stated that before the creation there is a world of ice below (the end), darkness, venom and all evil, and there is a world of fire above (the beginning), light, purity and good. Between the two is a meeting point where fire meets ice and here man and the visible world are created (the middle) and continue to function. For the relevence of the bracketed words (beginning, middle and end) the reader is referred to my paper, " The 'Mpanandro' (Maker of Days) of Imerina, Madagascar," Folk-Lore, Dec. 1949. 25 It should be borne in mind that authority is an inheritance from a line of ancestors and is not an attribute of an individual. It must be ceremonially acquired by an heir. The title Andriamanitra is a title of the reigning king and a name by which God is invoked: but it is also applied to any person in certain ceremonial situations. 26 See diagram 6.</page><page sequence="11">I96 The State Concept of Imerina quarters are shown (cf. those given in diagram 5), but they have been added in diagram 6 from the evidence supplied in the Chinese text. It can thus be seen, then, that the plan was divided into quarters, and the position of the centre, the point where the diagonals cross, was marked as being of some importance. The positions of the twelve months marked round the circumference are said to represent twelve rooms which the emperor occupied in turn in the succeeding months of the year. Ob- viously as given in this plan they more resemble the " places " in the room described in the two papers (op. cit. notes 6 and 24) on Mada- gascar, which are simply the positions of the months round the walls of a room as shown in diagram 5, and are not in fact rooms at all. But when the application of the scheme to territorial units is considered, the importance of the situation is obvious : it allows for the roomy arrange- ment, if a bad pun may be permitted, of twelve towns round a capital. It links diagram I in this paper, especially when its diagonals are in- cluded, with diagrams 2, 5, 6 and 7, and if thought of as a kings' palace not only illustrates the Chinese theory but also brings to mind a mysterious palace composed of twelve rooms round an orientated square central court discovered in the city of Ur. And in fact this diagram applies to more than an imperial palace and is important in connection with a well-known problem in Chinese studies. This problem is the phenomenon of the " nine provinces " which, with the terms " all within the four seas " and " the four quarters of the realm " is used as a synonym of the phrase " the whole kingdom ", and is often, but fortunately for the anthropologist not by Legge, translated into English by some such unspecific but unambiguous term. Attempts have been made to show that the territory of China did once comprise nine provinces orientated in the manner of the inner square of diagram 6, and arranged roughly at least in the same way-not with any great success. But this lack of success does not mean that the Chinese did not conceive, for purposes of ritual, of the territory of China being a squar, divided in this way into nine smaller squares. The Norse pattern is the least formalised of the diagrams shown in this paper, and in fact no diagrammatic representation of the scheme has in this case been found: that given in this paper has been specially con- structed from the evidence in the Norse texts. It is possible that but for the peculiar geographical conditions in Iceland which forced settlers to occupy the coastal regions all round the island, leaving the inhospitable interior almost desolate, there would have been very little evidence of the attempt to express the theory geographically.</page><page sequence="12">The State Concept of Imerina I97 In the case of Madagascar the diagrammatisation goes much further. This may, of course, be due to the fact that the society is still functioning, so that the signs are readily observable. Nevertheless it should be noticed that diagram 5 was in fact constructed by Malagasy and that at least one maker of days with whom I discussed the system in the field possessed a similar diagram drawn by his " grandfather " probably from a still older model. Ellis constructed a similar diagram in the eighteen thirties.27 The attachment of the scheme to any house, and the arrange- ment to some extent of all houses and of villages in accordance with the scheme, keeps it constantly in mind in a diagrammatic form: it is thus also to the field observer obvious as a factor in the environment of the people. But the Chinese possessed a genius for diagrammatisation, and to work out the scheme as given in the various documents for this culture (see note 3) is quite an experience. For where, in the other cultures, lz Diagram 7: China. Ritual plan of the Chinese state relationships are expressed in general terms,28 in China they are given in a precise and formulated manner which renders them the more easy to learn and to remember, but puts them quite out of step with physical fact. The larger and more complex a civilisation becomes, the less amenable is it to representation of this kind, until finally, as can be observed in following the history of the scheme in a rough sequence through the various Chinese texts, it becomes quite detached and de- velops into philosophies such as Taoism. As an example of this tendency to diagrammatisation, there is given above29 a plan which is a reconstruction from the texts of the Chinese 27 The term " grandfather " is an elastic one used to refer to an illustrious ancestor and not necessarily to a precise individual in the lineage. The maker of days referred to was a man of about seventy years. Ellis, History of Madagascar, vol. i, London, 1938 : p. 447- 28 Cf. diagrams 2 and 3. In these there are no precise measurements or demarca- tion indications to decide where on the diagonals the limits of towns or territories are to be drawn. 29 See diagram 7.</page><page sequence="13">I98 The State Concept of Imerina method. It was pointed out earlier that both the Norse and the Malagasy schemes had a capacity for expansion which was exemplified in the one case by the reproduction annually in little at the Icelandic Allthing of the plan of the whole Icelandic community (diagram 2), and in the other by the habit of thinking always in terms of north, south, east and west of any given central point whatever the distances involved (diagram 3). This same capacity is far more apparent in the Chinese scheme. This, as will be seen in diagram 7, begins with the divided central square seen in diagram 6, and it is divided, as is the earlier diagram, into nine smaller squares by joining those points opposite to each other on the perimeter of this whole square which mark the positions of the twelve months. It should be observed that precisely the same pattern would be obtained for Scandinavia if the intersections of the continuous square in diagram 2 were also joined in this way, or for Madagascar if the similar positions of the months in diagram 5, were marked and joined. The meaning of diagram 7 is as follows: the whole square may be taken to represent the Chinese empire; then the nine divisions of this are its major provinces, of which the central one is the royal province; the royal province is itself divided into nine smaller squares on the same principle as the original division, and of these the central square represents the royal capital in the centre of the royal province; this city is again divided as above and in this case the central square is the king's palace. That even the palace was supposed to be similarly divided has already been demonstrated in diagram 6, from Legge. This type of arbitrary division can never, it is obvious, have had any precise general substantiation: but it is possible that at some point in the diagrammatic scheme (e.g. the ritual palace which is shown in diagram 6) the spatial relationships were accurately reproduced. This suggestion is borne out by the fact that there appears to have been from very ancient times in China a school of officials whose business it was to make measure- ments of land surfaces large and small, to lay foundations and to keep plans and charts,30 as well as to observe the calendar and to announce days on which activities should be undertaken and those on which they should be avoided, etc. There appears to have been quite a hierarchy of these men, but the prototype is one of the three principal figures of the earliest books of the Shfi King, Shun. It will be realised from what has been already said that he has at the present time a counterpart in the 30 At a fairly late date Chinese geographers attempted to make scientific maps of the world outside China, representing China as the central square in a scheme of nine kingdoms on the model of diagram 6.

It is in fact the business of the " mpanandro "31 to preserve the theoretical and ritual pattern of the state, and so to lay the founda- tions of every building, every city, so to arrange the actions of everyone in the state, that this pattern is constantly before the eyes and in the imagination of all. If it has now been established that in the pattern of twelve chiefs attached to a superior whom they call chief or king, we are dealing in the first place not with a witch cult but with a ritual pattern of the state (in the cultures under discussion), we have then to inquire why in the case in which it occurs the witch cult should be organised on the same pattern, and what is its relation to the state pattern as a whole. In the paper on the witches of Madagascar (see note 6) it was suggested that functionally a witch cult32 attached in this way to a state cult might have the special object of enforcing the laws of the state by undertaking the punishment of the disobedient ostensibly at the instance of the ancestors who had laid down the pattern in the first place. This appears, in part, to be the situa- tion in Madagascar. The " mpisikidy ", or witch doctor (not the " mpan- andro "), who interprets the signs and announces the remedy, and who may even direct a witch in order to frighten the recalcitrant into sub- mission, may act as an intermediary. All members of the community serve the same powers, the gods and the ancestors : but the witches serve in a special capacity, as it were as an embryonic police force, and have therefore their own forms of service adapted to their special capacity. The form of their organisation is laid down for them by the same indivi- dual and with the same mechanism as is the form of the state itself. The " mpanandro ", the guardian of the state theory, has also the task of assigning destinies to individuals, and these destinies are assigned by known rules according to the month in which an individual is born. Ac- cording to these rules, all children born in the fifth month of the year must become witches. The witch cult therefore has an integrated relationship to the state concept. For if we couple, as we may if the preceding arguments are correct, the association of a destiny and a 31 It should be noticed that this " astrologer ", although he deals with houses literally in his assigning of destinies and foundation rites, takes no sidereal measurements and in fact, does not know the names of the stars. His calendar is lunar. The term geomancer, used of the modern Chinese counterpart, is more satisfactory. "8 Distinguishing, of course, between a witch cult and the almost universal unorganised practice of witchcraft, and observing also that in Madagascar such a witch cult may be a philosophical fiction rather than a social fact.</page><page sequence="15">200 The State Concept of Imerina month with that of a month and a relation with the cardinal points of the compass, that is to say a spatial position, it is then possible to suggest that at some point of the scheme in fact, and at every point in theory, one of the twelve positions corresponds with the destiny of witch. For instance, one of the twelve Andriana clans in Imerina might be expected to provide a person who is at least regarded as responsible for the death of a king: one of the twelve chiefs would be regarded as a witch, all his clan as witches under his guidance. However, the evidence for such a statement as regards Madagascar is quite inconclusive, although it is believed that a certain important village near Tananarive is populated mainly by witches. But it is perhaps at least worth notice that in the account of the betrayal of Christ we have described precisely this situation: the death was brought about by one, and by one only, of the twelve followers of the " king ". On the other hand the book of Leviticus provides a pattern for the camp of the twelve tribes of Israel which quite reasonably may be compared with diagrams 2, 5, 6 in this paper. There is, however, no evidence at all that a witch cult of the pattern described by Dr. Margaret Murray for pre-Scandinavian Western Europe, or by the present author for Madagascar, depended upon the state ritual of this same pattern in Scandinavia. Witchcraft was, of course, practised, but we do not know and have no justification even for surmising, that it took this form. If, however, any speculation may be hazarded along the lines suggested by Mr. Kingsland, it would not be, in view of the evidence presented in this paper, to the effect that the Scandinavian berserks were a coven of witches, but that one of the ber- serks may have been a witch, the head of a clan or family of witches." 33 It was only recently that I happened to see A. M. Hocart's " In the Grip of Tradition ", Folk-Lore, Sept. 1938. The section headed " The Dictator ", p. 265 to the end of the first paragraph on p. 266 is exceedingly interesting in this connection. Hocart says : " Of our twelve disciples eleven were good, the twelfth a traitor. It is important because of the earliest company of twelve I have yet traced. The Vedic king in the course of his consecration on twelve successive days calls at the house of each of twelve court personages. Of these the first eleven are called his jewels, but the twelfth is an obscure personage, the discarded queen who represents Nirriti, the earth as the abode of decay." Of these personages " every- one represents a god whom we know, from other evidence, to have been in charge of some star or constellation lying near the ecliptic, the only exception being the 'Way '." It has also just been brought to my attention that in Sweden there used to be persons known as " Summoners of the dying " who would climb upon the house roof and call away by name the souls of those who were having a difficult death (Reidar Christiansen, The Dead and the Living, pp. I9, 21, Oslo, 1948). There may well be a relationship (i.e. of category) between these persons and those who in Madagascar knock upon the doors and call the names of the dying.</page><page sequence="16">The State Concept of Imerina 201 One more observation may be made concerning the twelve positions in this scheme. If, as seems likely in some and is certain in other cases, a god is identified with each of these, it is possible that some conclusions may be arrived at as to the nature of these gods, and certain ambiguities concerning them can be understood. For instance gods named as among the twelve are often highly defined figures in other connections, and yet as one of this company seem to have a curious anonymity, to become confused with one another and to resolve into something very like sticks and stones. These gods, in fact, are not as a company primarily con- cerned with moral qualities, with special powers and local custom etc. but are intended to mark positions in a diagrammatic scheme. From their position they may assume certain attributes, e.g. seasonal, and they may be distinguished by individual names, and according to ceremonies performed in their seasonal cycle, they may be involved in different myths and have certain stories attached to them. Some, at least, of these systems, however, have an annual cycle which does not correspond with solar time, so that the spring gods, for instance, may be playing their roles in what is really autumn etc. and it may be a considerable period before the ritual first day of the first month of the year coincides again with its solar equivalent. The twelve gods of the system therefore are really functionally distinct only if they exist also outside the system as it were in an individual capacity as seen in local worship; within the system, providing there is a god for each of the twelve positions, the name and other characteristics are of small importance and can be altered within wide limits. The names of the twelve may therefore show all sorts of inconsistencies, intrusions, even some may be lost, later local deities, or popular heroes' names may supplant those of an older time, and still the system itself remains unbroken. For this reason all informa- tion about it, from early or late sources, should be collected, even when e.g. only seven actual names can be given or if thirteen or fourteen are included, and even when two or more such confused sets of twelve seem to be involved : the names themselves are relatively unimportant. The position in the system, on the other hand, is much more so. It will be seen from the foregoing that the author has avoided the adoption of any general critical theories with regard to the presentation of the material, and it has not been the object of this paper to present any such general critical discussion, but simply to demonstrate the existence of systems of this kind in several societies. It is a matter of considerable interest that sets of ideas in many ways so similar to each other should be encountered in societies so different in other respects as P</page><page sequence="17">202 The State Concept of Imerina those discussed above, but it should not be concluded from this paper that the similarities are the result of e.g. diffusion. On the evidence given it is not permissible to draw any such conclusion and it may well be that when these systems are individually and fully investigated some other explanation, or a combination of explanations, will seem better to fit the facts. In the meantime the assemblage of all available relevent facts which will show the nature, distribution and variations of such systems is likely to be the most profitable method of procedure. I should like to record my thanks to Professors J. H. Hutton and H. Th. Fischer for their critical advice on the manuscript, to Prof. G. Haloun for his help and advice in the study of the classical Chinese material, and to Dr. H. Ellis Davidson for her comments on the Scandinavian section.
