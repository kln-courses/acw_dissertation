<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics DAVID M. BETHEA One of the more fascinating aspects of Nabokov's artistic method is the way he "covers his tracks" when referring to potential intertextual sources or "influences." He prefers his readers to believe that each work has emerged fully formed from the broad forehead (as opposed to dark loins) of his Zeus-like consciousness. Or so the prefaces to his novels, with their disclaimers as to matters of genealogy and their repeated references to the "Viennese delegation," would have us think. It is not that Nabokov hesitates to engage in intertextual punning or name-dropping, which practice clearly enriches the links within his own works to the classics of world literature and culture-to those names, titles, characters, lines of verse, emplotted situations, titbits of literary (and nonliterary) history, and so on, whose subtle interweaving makes Nabokov, like Joyce, one of the central figures in twentieth-century high modernism. However, to judge by the master's obiter dicta, this intertextual play is not meant in any serious way to undermine the originality of a novel's or story's central idea. Cincinnatus C. is not, despite the many intriguing parallels, an intertextual brother to Joseph K., since at the time (1934) he wrote Invitation to a Beheading (Priglashenie na kazn"), Nabokov-Sirin supposedly "had no German, was completely ignorant of modern German literature, and had not yet read any French or English translations of Kafka's works."' My own point in these preliminaries is not to gainsay Nabokov, as he may be telling the truth,2 but rather to underscore his expressed need to distance himself from Kafka and to assert his own independence (the one influence he will admit being of course "the melancholy, extravagant, wise, witty, magical, and altogether delightful Pierre Delalande, whom I [Nabokov-Sirin] invented").3 In this respect, Nabokov beats his bqte noire, the Freudians, to the punch: even as he "protests too much" about how critics have hurled the "harmless missiles" of "Gogol, Tolstoevski, Joyce, Voltaire, Sade, Stendhal, Balzac, Byron ... [the list goes on to include other greats as well as fictional authors]"4 in his direction as sources for his style and ideas, he wins. Either 'Vladimir Nabokov, Invitation to a Beheading (New York, 1965), 6. 2At least his biographer thinks so. Brian Boyd, Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years (Princeton, 1990), 415: "Nabokov denied that he had been influenced by Kafka, and there seems no reason whatever to doubt his disclaimer." 3Nabokov, Invitation, 6. 4Ibid.

In chess parlance, this comes under the classification of anticipating the next move. The purpose of the present essay is to retrace Nabokov's steps, and uncover his intertextual tracks, in the very "American" Lolita, by returning to one of the central texts of Russian Symbolism, Fedor Sologub's Melkii bes (The Petty Demon, 1907).5 My argument will be that, rather than looking at the more obvious intertextual clues in Lolita, such as those involving Poe, M6rim6e, Shakespeare, Joyce, Cervantes, or Hugo,6 which point to Western sources and are more easily recoverable by the author's primary (anglophone) audience, the genuine or deeper structural sibling in this case comes from a source closer to home-the fin de siecle Russian Symbolist/Decadent movement that Nabokov experienced at a still impressionable age and that, to a degree he often hinted at but was not willing to admit outright, was powerfully formative.' Of Blok, for example, undoubtedly a stronger influence on him in his early years than Sologub, Nabokov wrote Edmund Wilson in 1943, "I am glad you are studying Blok-but be careful: he is one of those poets that gets into one's system-and everything else seems unblokish and flat. I, as most Russians, went through that stage some twenty-five years ago."' What I will be suggesting is that in Lolita Nabokov is not merely invoking Sologub in a mockingbird game of "trivial pursuit," but actually engaging The Petty Demon at a deeper striation, with the result that the central concerns of Sologub's novel are precisely those of Nabokov's, 5Melkii bes was written 1892-1902, excerpted serially in Voprosy zhizni, and published separately in 1907. For the purposes of the present study I am using the following edition of Sologub and the translations of his work are, unless otherwise indicated, my own: Fedor Sologub, Melkii bes. Stikhotvoreniia. Rasskazy. Skazochki (Moscow, 1999). 61 take these names from some of those that appear in Appel's annotations to the opening pages of the novel. See Vladimir Nabokov, The AnnotatedLolita, ed. Alfred Appel, Jr. (New York, 1970), 321-36. Other names, such as Rimbaud, Verlaine, and Maeterlinck, could be added virtually at random, simply by leafing through Appel's annotations. But a pattern (certain figures-Poe, for example-seem freighted with greater meaning and "emplottedness" than others) does appear to emerge: one could call it primarily "French" (Poe was a favorite among the French Symbolists) and "symbolist" and/or "romantic." This is because Nabokov, raised in the atmosphere of Russian Symbolism, imbibed the latter through its filtering and enthusiastic "russianizing" of Poe, Baudelaire, Verlaine, Rimbaud, and numerous other (mostly French) Symbolists, all of whom were translated by those such as Briusov and Balmont. On this last point see especially the astute remarks in A. Dolinin, "Bednaia 'Lolita'," in Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita, ed. A. Dolinin (Moscow, 1991), 6. 7"Though he has denied the influence of the Russian Symbolists upon him in an interview, Nabokov says that he had digested 'the entire population' of the 'so-called' Silver Age in the soft-cover ivory Sirin volumes which he purchased at a certain table at Volf's, a large St. Petersburg bookstore" (Andrew Field, Nabokov: His Life in Part [New York, 1977], 95). 8Simon Karlinsky, ed., The Nabokov- Wilson Letters, 1940-1971 (New York, 1979), 94. In the Russian version of Lolita, Nabokov gave the name of Quilty's anagrammatical biographer as "Vivian Damor-Blok" (= Vladimir Nabokov), whereas in the English version this biographer is camouflaged as "Vivian Darkbloom." The point is that Blok's shadow, the shadow of the greatest and most "infectious" Russian Symbolist, is present as Nabokov's "co- author" (parodied of course) in the creation of the diabolical double Quilty. Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita, trans. V. Nabokov (New York, 1967), n.p.; Nabokov, AnnotatedLolita, 6. One should also mention in this regard the five "B"s (Blok, Belyi, Briusov, Bal'mont, and either Bunin or Baltrushaitis) of the "new" Russian poetry that the autobiographical hero Fedor had accepted with ecstatic approval ("voskhishchenno, blagodarno, polnost'iu, bez kriticheskikh zatei") in his adolescence in The Gift (Vladimir Nabokov, Dar [Ann Arbor, 1975], 85).</page><page sequence="3">50 David M. Bethea but in reverse.9 At issue here then is not intertextuality at a "micro" but at a "macro" level. Nabokov, as I will try to demonstrate, is returning to some of the key aesthetic and ethical problems with which he got his start in prerevolutionary Russia: How does one approach ethically the human incarnation of beauty? Is the Beautiful Lady (of Solov'ev, Blok, and Belyi fame) an angelic or demonic (or daemonic-Nabokov plays with the different spellings) presence in the life of the beholder? Is the world (and word) structure that filters everything we see and do really Manichean or still perhaps Judaeo-Christian? In the pursuit of beauty, at which point does one's aesthetic seeing and feeling (the lovely patterns on a butterfly's wing, the way the human body moves gracefully in a young person) intersect and implicate one's ethical seeing and feeling? What are the rules of zhiznetvorchestvo, that very Symbolist game of "life creation" that incorporates others, often unbeknownst to them, in making myth (or mythos, literary plot) out of one's personal life? But then, having returned to these formative issues, Nabokov again brilliantly covers his tracks, by projecting them onto an American literary-cultural chronotope that has no memory of The Petty Demon (Sologub does not seem to be directly cited in the text of Lolita) or of a young Russian's first encounter with it. Sologub's The Petty Demon was clearly a book the young Nabokov read and pondered. According to Andrew Field, it was one of the period volumes in Nabokov pare's library.'0 More to the point, as one of the most celebrated (and notorious) of Symbolist texts, it was, along with Blok's lyrics and Belyi's Petersburg, bound to strike a resonant chord in the adolescent Nabokov. Intriguingly, we have virtually no references by Nabokov himself to Sologub or his novel in his surviving correspondence." Moreover, one of the very few times Nabokov said anything about Sologub in print was a characteristically dismissive judgment that, if taken at face value, could only suggest that the decadent author would be the last person Nabokov would take seriously or deem worthy of returning to: "that very minor writer for whom England and America show such an unaccountable predilection."'2 On the other hand, we also have a number of fairly significant intertextual allusions to Sologub in general and The Petty Demon in particular in Sirin's early Russian work, allusions which to a significant degree counteract The New Republic assessment 9The well-known Cold War-generation Slavist Ernest J. Simmons once tossed off a formulation that was more prescient than he realized: "Sologub introduces into the novel [The Petty Demon] the extensive episode of the seduction of the handsome young schoolboy Sasha by the erotic and sadistically-minded demi-vierge Ludmila. It is a Lolita situation in reverse, and the scenes are wantonly delightful and flecked with humor and not a little satire" (Fyodor Sologub, The Petty Demon, trans. Andrew Field [Bloomington, 1970], xii). At the time (1962, in the translation's first edition) Simmons made the comparison of the seduction scenes in Lolita and The Petty Demon, one has to assume that his point was not one of literary genealogy (that is, Nabokov is actually engaging Sologub in his American novel) but one of "typology," of fortuitously parallel structures. Other than this brief remark by Simmons, the precise links between The Petty Demon and Lolita have not, to the best of this reader's knowledge, been studied in a systematic way. 'O"Apart from an occasional best-seller such as Fyodor Sologub's The Petty Demon and some old Solovyov and Rozanov the library [of V. D. Nabokov] contains very few of the Sirin books, the publishing house which printed most of the modernists of the time" (Field, Nabokov: His Life in Part, 95). 1"An exception is a brief discussion of a Sologub poem with Andrew Field in Vladimir Nabokov, SelectedLetters, 1940-1977, ed. Dmitri Nabokov and Matthew J. Bruccoli (San Diego, 1989), 487. 12Vladimir Nabokov, "Cabbage Soup and Caviar," New Republic 110 (17 January 1944): 92.</page><page sequence="4">Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics 51 and could be seen to imply that he saw the earlier writer as a part of the tradition he was wrestling with and trying to make his own."' In Mary (Mashen'ka, 1926), for example, Nabokov-Sirin's first novel, the unsavory character Alferov spits out a piece of chocolate that then sticks to the wall of the pension, a probable reference to Peredonov, who both likes sweets and is notorious for spitting on the walls in The Petty Demon.14 And in Invitation to a Beheading, as Vladimir Alexandrov has pointed out, the symbolic representation of children (compare the proto-Lolita Emmie as well as the young Cincinnatus) comes very close to that found in Sologub.15 Most convincing, however, are the numerous allusions to The Petty Demon in Despair (Otchaianie, 1936), a novel that, with its emphasis on the aesthetics of crime, doubles, and the obsessive behavior and potential madness of a first-person narrator, provides a powerful precedent for the thematics and architectonics ofLolita.'6 Here we encounter a character named Ardalion (Peredonov's first name), a cane/walking stick that gets turned against its owner (a motif in both novels), a reference to a melkii demon (an obvious play on melkii bes), another character called Perebrodov (vs. Peredonov), a case of spitting straight in the face of a less-than-hygienic girlfriend (Lida vs. Varvara), and various other explicit reminders of the Sologubian genesis of Hermann's type of "petty" evil.17 In other words, Nabokov may have successfully reinvented himself for his American audience in Lolita, but there is every reason to believe that, if we can slow down his conjuror's tricks to a speed visible to our reader's eye, we will see that the differing roles and interrelationships of Sologub's Peredonov, Sasha, and Liudmila are being replayed through Humbert's crime of seduction, his "safely solipsizing" of the heroine, in Lolita. First, the literal level of meaning in Sologub's text. The Petty Demon is the story of an evil presence (hence the title) in a provincial Russian town at the turn of the century. One '3Although relatively little has been written on Nabokov-Sirin's intertextual relations with Sologub in the 1920s and 1930s, two recent exceptions to this trend should be cited: Ol'ga Skonechnaia, "Otchaianie V. Nabokova i Melkii bes F. Sologuba: K voprosu o traditsiiakh russkogo simvolizma v proze V. V. Nabokova 1920-1930-kh gg.," in Vladimir Nabokov-Sirine: Les Annees Europeenes, ed. Nora Buhks (Paris, 1999), 133-43; and Iu. Leving, "Rakovinnyi gul nebytiia (V. Nabokov i F. Sologub)," in Vladimir Nabokov: Pro et contra, vol. 2, ed. D. K. Burlaka (St. Petersburg, 2001), 499-519. Both of these pieces make strong cases for the presence of Sologub (particularly Melkii bes and Tiazhelye sny) in such Nabokov-Sirin works as Otchaianie (Despair), Priglashenie na kazn' (Invitation to a Beheading), and Dar (The Gift). '4See Vladimir Nabokov, Sobranie sochinenii russkogo perioda v piati tomakh, vol. 2 (St. Petersburg, 1999), 120, 697. The edition also cites the lamb dinner being served at thepension as a possible reference to the character Volodin in The Petty Demon, who is regularly likened to a baran ("ram") and who, like Alferov, is set up as a sacrificial victim, but the allusion strikes this reader as somewhat far-fetched (pp. 56, 693). '5Vladimir E. Alexandrov, Nabokov's Otherworld (Princeton, 1991), 107. Alexandrov cites the following important passage from Melkii bes as evidence: "Only the children, those eternal, tireless vessels of God's joy in the earth, were alive, and ran, and played. But sluggishness was beginning to weigh even upon them, and some faceless and invisible monster, nestling behind their shoulders, peered from time to time with eyes full of menace into their faces, which suddenly went dull" (Sologub, Melkii bes, 88 [Alexandrov's translation]). Much of the Gnostic or Manichean structure of Invitation to a Beheading can also be seen to interact in productive ways with Sologub's major fiction, including Melkii bes. '6Again, for more on the numerous connections between Despair and The Petty Demon, see the discussion in Skonechnaia, "Otchaianie V. Nabokova i Melkii bes F. Sologuba." '7See Nabokov, Sobranie sochinenii 3:415/759, 431/762, 453/766, 458/766, 463/767, 465/768, 483/770, 498/771, and 522/776.</page><page sequence="5">52 David M. Bethea of the central ironies of the novel and one Sologub cultivated in his various prefaces is to whom or what exactly the title refers: Is it the protagonist, Peredonov, who gradually goes out of his mind, commits murder, and himself appears as the incarnation of petty evil (and who was thought by some critics to be an autobiographical portrait of the sadistic teacher Teternikov)? Is it the subplot revolving around Aleksandr (Sasha) Pyl'nikov, whose appearance in town seems somehow to incite Peredonov's mad acts (note how the nedotykomka begins to appear to Peredonov shortly after the latter first sees Pyl'nikov in church and, curiously, whenever the nedotykomka is on stage Pyl'nikov is absent, and vice-versa'8) and whose tutelage in amoral paganism and eroticism at the knee (literally) of the Rutilova sister Liudmila can be viewed in terms of traditional Christian teaching as itself "demonic"? Is it the atmosphere of the entire town, which seems "possessed" by poshlost' (vulgarity, pettiness), which produces victims (Peredonov in the first instance) that are symptomatic of the problem without necessarily being the source of it, and which is embodied in the gray, indeterminate, yet forever moving and tormenting nedotykomka? Or is it, finally, in a Gogolian reading Sologub encouraged, the "petty demon" that resides in Russia as a whole and that, to borrow Baudelaire's line, is the still larger implicit target: "Hypocrite lecteur, - mon semblable, - mon frbre"?'9 Thus, the ontological nature of evil is a, perhaps the, crucial starting point in Sologub's novel.20 It is so because all actions and reactions by the narrator and characters, all perceptions and conclusions as to why the world is the way it is, are filtered through that starting point. (By the same token, it is this same starting point from which Nabokov, mutatis mutandis, will initiate his plot about malign intent in Lolita.) What this means on a metaphysical level is that Sologub's universe is, a priori, Manichean and false, created not by a benevolent God but by a Gnostic demiurge.2' Likewise, as Tomas Venclova has elegantly argued, it is ruled by demonypyli (demons of dust), these carriers of spiritual entropy first introduced by Briusov in his 1899 poem by that name (Sologub was present among the audience in St. Petersburg when Briusov first read the verses in public) and then developed conceptually by Merezhkovskii, who saw in this foregrounding of the diabolical as lukewarm and petty an obvious continuation of Gogol (Gogol' i chert [ 1906]), and Viacheslav Ivanov, who personified this dipintegration of spiritual light/energy as the deity Ariman (as opposed to Lucifer, the grand demonic personality) (Rodnoe i "Mentioned in Tomas Venclova, "K demonologii russkogo simvolizma," in Christianity and The Eastern Slavs, III, ed. Boris Gasparov et al. (Berkeley, 1995), 152-53. 19"It is true, people love to be loved. They like it when elevated and noble sides of the soul are depicted. ... And that's why they don't believe it when the depiction in front of them is reliable, precise, gloomy, evil. They want to say, 'He's speaking about himself.' No, my dear contemporaries, it is about you that I have written my novel about the Petty Demon and its terrifying Nedotykomka, Ardalion and Varvara Peredonov, Pavel Volodin, Dar'ia, Liudmila, and Valeriia Rutilova, Aleksandr Pyl'nikov, and others. It's about you" (Sologub, Melkii bes, 14). Baudelaire was a favorite of the Symbolists. 20A lone escapist from humble origins who knew poverty and humiliation firsthand, Sologub did not begin with any of the initial idealism of a Blok or Belyi. The biographical and historical reasons mediating (but not necessarily explaining) Sologub's special brand of aesthetic Symbolism lie beyond the scope of this essay. 21For a Gnostic reading of Melkii bes see Irene Masing-Delic, "'Peredonov's Little Tear'- Why Is It Shed," in Fyodor Sologub, The Petty Demon, ed. Murl Barker (Ann Arbor, 1983), 333-43.

Just as the town is constantly described in terms of dirt and dust- "Again the weather was overcast. The wind blew in gusts and bore funnels of dust (pyl'nye vikhri) along the streets. Everything was illuminated by a sad, almost un-sun-like light cast through the cloudy mist"-so too are its inhabitants-Grushina's skin is said to be "all covered with wrinkles that were fine and as iffilled with dust (zapylennye)."24 Even the nedotykomka seems to appear, and, paradoxically, draw its haunting strength from, the debilitating presence of dust, disorder, indeterminacy, shape-shifting: The nedotykomka ran under the chairs and into the corners and began to let out a shriek. It was dirty, evil-smelling, disgusting, terrifying. It was by now clear that it was inimical to Peredonov and that it had turned up precisely on his account, and that previously it had not existed at any time or in any place. ... Here it is alive, sent to terrorize and destroy Peredonov, magical, of differing shapes; it follows after Peredonov, tricks him, laughs at him, now rolling on the floor, now pretending to be a rag, a piece of ribbon, a branch, a flag, a cloud, a dog, a column of dust on the street (stolbom pyli), and all the while crawling and running after Peredonov, exhausting him, wearing him out with its shimmering dance.25 The secret knowledge or gnosis that the parodically questing character (here Peredonov, "the Don [Quixote] done over"26) seeks is everywhere covered by the demonic dust particles. Indeed, in Sologub's pessimistic worldview, the secret is the dust. There is no transcendence. Princess Volchanskaia is a Beautiful Lady who will never come. Varvara, whose debauched head belongs to Aldonsa and whose weirdly beautiful (bewitched?) torso belongs to Dulcinea ("the body of a tender nymph"27), is the bride as both cousin (the taboo of incest) and slut. "And this is how it often happens, for in truth it is the lot of beauty in our time to be trampled and cursed."28 Into this fallen world comes Sasha Pyl'nikov. He is a beautiful child with epicene features,29 a veritable young Dionysus, while the dancing, drinking Rutilova sisters are 22See Venclova, "K demonologii," 134-60, esp. 134-42. 23Ibid., 138 (original in Russian). 24Sologub, Melkii bes, 88, 41. This last instance is cited in Venclova, "K demonologii," 146. 25Sologub, Melkii bes, 228 (emphasis added). Compare this passage and the immediately subsequent phrasing (for example, "Khot' by kto-nibud' izbavil, slovom kakim ili udarom naotmash"') with Sologub's 1899 poem (written a few months after hearing Briusov's "Demony pyli") "Nedotykomka seraia" (Fedor Sologub, Stikhotvoreniia, ed. M. I. Dikman [Leningrad, 1975], 234). 26Andrew Field, "Preface," in Sologub, Petty Demon, trans. Field, xix. 27Sologub, Melkii bes, 62. 28Ibid. 29Note how the very first reference to him by Grushina describes him as a "disguised maiden" (pereodetaia baryshnia). He is also alluded to repeatedly by this superstitious community as a "shape-shifter" (oboroten). See Sologub, Melkii bes, 109-10.</page><page sequence="7">54 David M Bethea his maenads. Physically, he is distinguished by luxuriant hair (especially his dark eyelashes), a trademark of Dionysus. And from the very beginning he is associated with ecstatic religion and ritual: Peredonov moved forward, toward the middle rows [of the church]. There, at the very end of the row, to the right, stood Sasha Pyl'nikov. He was praying in a modest fashion and often getting down on his knees. Peredonov looked at him: it was particularly pleasant to see Sasha on his knees, as though someone being punished, looking forward at the radiant altar doors, with a concerned and beseeching expression on his face, with entreaty and sadness in his black eyes, shaded as they were by long, blue-black eyelashes. He was dark-complected, gracefully slender (stroinyi)-a fact especially obvious when he sat, calm and erect, on his knees, as if under somebody's sternly observant glance-and with a high and broad chest. He seemed to Peredonov the very image of a maiden.30 Note here, before any of the action surrounding the Sasha-Liudmila subplot gets underway, the chasteness of Sasha's young body coupled with the sincerity/purity of his inner world, his soul. It is this "intact" quality, seen against the backdrop of its potential sadistic defilement (Sasha on his knees, his modesty, his position as one being punished, and the like), that attracts the demonic Peredonov to him. Other motifs that point unmistakably to the myth of Dionysus are: women helpers as snake handlers (Liudmila's dream) and flower bearers (the scents from Liudmila's perfumes); the reversal of social roles during Dionysian festivals, including cross-dressing by boys and men (Liudmila's clothing of Sasha in female attire); and the appearance of the young Dionysus as beardless (Liudmila praises Sasha's lack of usiki and boroda) and partially nude (Liudmila eventually strips Sasha to the waist).31 And finally, of course, there is the climactic scene of the masquerade ball, where the "geisha girl," a la Dionysus, is "torn apart," or nearly (hence the parody), by the mad celebrants. While the myth of Dionysus is central to the "pagan" subplot in The Petty Demon, just as the myth of the nymph (or "nymphet") will be significant to the nontranscendent world of Humbert Humbert, I would like to pause here for a moment to focus on the function of the aesthetic realm in Sologub (and, by implication, Nabokov). As stated, there is no escape from the poshlyi (vulgar, petty) world of Sologub's demiurge. However, through their erotic play, which is essentially foreplay, Sasha and Liudmila come as close as is humanly possible to exiting this prison. Following the Symbolist notion of the sexual/procreative act itself as degradation and animality (Solov'ev, the Merezhkovskiis, 30Ibid., 114-15. 31See Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth, eds., The Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3d ed. (Oxford, 1996), 480-81: "Typical features of Dionysus and his religion-including wine and ivy; divine epiphanies and ecstatic forms of worship; women dancing, handling snakes, or holding flowers; the divine child and nurturing females; and bulls with and without anthropomorphic features-all are prominent in Aegean, especially Cretan religion and art. ... Festivals of Dionysus were often characterized by ritual licence and revelry, including reversal of social roles, cross-dressing by boys and men, drunken comasts in the streets, as well as widespread boisterousness and obscenity. ... No other deity is more frequently represented in ancient art than Dionysus ... later [after 430 BC] he usually appears youthful and beardless, effeminate, and partially or entirely nude."</page><page sequence="8">Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics 55 Blok and Belyi, and so on), Sologub raises the art of making love without performing intercourse to a new level. (Again, to leap ahead of ourselves a little, it is precisely this line that Humbert crosses and ethically criminalizes in his "solipsizing" of Lolita.) For example, Liudmila is interested in Sasha first and foremost because he is not mature: "The best age for boys," said Liudmila, "is fourteen-fifteen years old. He [Sasha] still can't do anything and doesn't understand fully, but he already has a presentiment of everything, absolutely everything. And he doesn't have a disgusting beard. ... "You [Liudmila's sisters] don't understand a thing. I don't love him at all in the way you think. To love a boy is better than falling in love with a vulgar mug with a moustache. I love him in an innocent way. I don't need anything from him."32 It is precisely this notion of "staged" eroticism-the combination of physical youth and beauty, bright colors, exotic smells, limited caressing or touching, the ritualized exchange of pleasure and pain (the sadomasochistic theme), the playing at sacred boundaries/taboos (child abuse, the undercurrent of incest), and so on-without "penetration" or mature heterosexual relations that is Humbert Humbert's dream, only with the roles reversed. "I am not concerned with so-called 'sex' at all," says Humbert. "Anybody can imagine those elements of animality. A greater endeavor lures me on: to fix once for all the perilous magic of nymphets."33 The enchanted hunter even goes so far as to define, in terms of temporal boundaries, the exact parameters of his mythic prey (the "nymphet"), just as Liudmila (in the above quote) had been quite precise about the age of her young Dionysus: Now I wish to introduce the following idea. Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than they, reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as "nymphets." ... You have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite melancholy, with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a super-voluptuous flame permanently aglow in your subtle spine (oh, how you have to cringe and hide!), in order to discern at once, by ineffable signs-the slightly feline outline of the cheekbone, the slenderness of a downy limb, and other indices which despair and shame and tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulate-the little deadly demon among the wholesome children; she stands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic power.34 Perhaps the key to the attraction that the younger partner holds for the older one in both relationships, other than the fact that the bashful epicene and the nymph-like tomboy35 32Sologub, Melkii bes, 165-66. 33Nabokov, Annotated Lolita, 136. 34Ibid., 18-19. 35Just as Sasha's sexual identity is made deliberately ambiguous/androgynous by Sologub (that presumably is part of his charm), so too is Lolita's by Nabokov: she wears a "boy's shirt" and "tomboy clothes," has "boy knees" and "little doves" for breasts, and so on (ibid., 48, 50, 51, 122).</page><page sequence="9">56 David M. Bethea are as physically lovely as they are sexually ambivalent, is that they are unaware of their beauty or "daemonic" (projecting an inner spirit) status. Stated simply, they are viewed as blank pages to be written on, which inevitably raises the issue of art and the role of the older partner as artist or shaper of this virgin material. Thus, the emphasis on punning and proto-poetry that goes with the seduction scenes in both novels is part and parcel of this foreplay, the sense that these neophytes are being introduced into a kind of game that is verbal and erotic at the same time and that does not necessarily lead anywhere, except back to itself (the aesthetic principle): Liudmila asking Sasha "Kto zhelaet?" (Who wishes/ desires?) but then teasing him with the same phrase parsed differently "Kto zhe laet?" (Who is that barking?), or even better her double entendre on rozochki (meaning either "roses" or "birch rods"-that is, the source of pleasure or pain); Humbert singing along with Lolita the "Carmen/barmen" ditty (presumably Lolita does not know who the original Carmen is) at the moment that her legs are extended across his lap.36 The structural parallels between the two plots reach an apogee in their respective "lap" scenes. The notion of lap (lono in Russian, but also na koleniakh, as in sitting "on [someone's] knees") is suggestive in both cultural contexts, as Nabokov (if not Sologub) was well aware. It evokes connotations of nurture and comfort, as of a mother holding a smaller child "on her lap" or "at her breast" (lono can mean figuratively both "lap" and "bosom"), but it also can become eroticized, particularly when the place being offered is male and close to the genitals (as in Humbert's case).37 The figure doing the sitting is symbolically in a more vulnerable or submissive position (note the link here between Sasha in church "on his knees, as though someone being punished," and his repeated pose later in the text on Liudmila's knees). The fact that we see the child shift its status before our eyes from someone traditionally protected to someone explicitly eroticized and fetishized, while sitting on a "protector's" knees, is precisely what has made the two stories so controversial. So-called moral outrage (again, something Sologub rightly or wrongly seems not at all concerned about) meets aesthetic titillation in an exceptionally potent brew. Furthermore, it is during these lap scenes qua pseudo-epiphanic moments that the adult characters declare (Liudmila openly to Sasha, Humbert significantly only to himself) their fervent faith in their pagan religions: Liudmila tells Sasha she is a iazychnitsa (pagan) and he is her otrok-bogoravnyi (god-like youth); Humbert exclaims, as he surreptitiously masturbates against the pressure of Dolly's body, that Lolita has been "safely solipsized."38 And it is during these very lap scenes, I would argue, that the notion of crime, which is absent in Sologub's text, enters the picture in Nabokov's, exposing what could be called, at least for the younger writer who had lived through the excesses of Symbolist myth-making, the limits of decadent aesthetics. 36Sologub, Melkii bes, 157; Nabokov, Annotated Lolita, 60-64. There are numerous instances of punning as erotic foreplay in the Liudmila-Sasha relationship. It can be argued that this more subtle use of language is a positive counterpoint to the linguistic degeneration in the Peredonov plot-for example, the idiotic rhyming of Tishkov (Sologub, Melkii bes, 87). Intriguingly, the reference to Carmen in Lolita, with its theme of female "possession" and jealousy, was an habitual topos among the Symbolists, Nabokov's favorite Blok in particular. See footnote 8 above. 37In the Russian version of the novel Nabokov repeatedly uses the term lono to describe Dolly's "seat" on Humbert that Sunday morning. See Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita (Russian version), 48. 38Sologub, Melkii bes, 238-39; Nabokov, Annotated Lolita, 62.</page><page sequence="10">Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics 57 Looking more closely, what exactly is at stake in these parallel lap scenes and what are the significant affinities, and inversions, shaping them? First of all, with regard to Sologub, a strong argument can be made for the total absence of an ethical realm. Gorky understood this implicitly and this is what so incensed him about the unregenerate "decadent."39 What I mean by absence of ethics is that no one is immune to the "demonic" in Sologub's world-there is no one who is ethically above the fray. Liudmila and Sasha are, for the time they have together (and clearly Liudmila understands that these days are numbered), god-like aesthetically, that is, Sasha is the otrok-bog and Liudmila his guide and worshiper, but not ethically. Their virtue has nothing to do with kindness or goodness or self-abnegation, but with beauty and form and self-affirmation. Likewise, Peredonov and all the denizens of his lower world are "evil" not because they hurt or torment others (which they do), but because they defile and disfigure-that is, they contribute to the absence of beauty and form. Hence the ethical is simply not a category that is engaged in The Petty Demon. Moreover, this a priori understanding affects the intimate scenes involving Sasha and Liudmila in intriguing ways, particularly when certain details are juxtaposed with Nabokov's presentation. For example, the closest we come to force or coercion in Sasha and Liudmila's erotic foreplay is the time Liudmila wants her young god to disrobe to the waist: [Liudmila] drew Sasha to herself and began to unbutton his shirt. Sasha tried to fight her off, grabbing hold of her hands. His face took on a frightened look and shame akin to fear overcame him. And because of this it seemed as though he momentarily lost his strength. Liudmila knitted her brows and with determination began to undress him. She took off his belt, then somehow pulled off his smock (bluza). Sasha fought her off more and more desperately. They struggled, circling around the bedroom and bumping into tables and chairs. An intoxicating sweet smell came from Liudmila and went to Sasha's head and overpowered him. With a swift shove in the chest Liudmila toppled Sasha onto the sofa. A button popped off the shirt at which she had been tugging. Liudmila quickly exposed Sasha's shoulder and then began to pull his arm out of this sleeve. Fighting back Sasha struck Liudmila by mistake on her cheek with the palm of his hand. Of course he hadn't wanted to hit her, but the blow, which landed on her cheek with all his strength, was powerful and loud. Liudmila shuddered, wobbled a bit, turned blood red, but did not release Sasha. "You wicked boy, fighting [like this]," she screamed with a choking voice. Sasha was terribly embarrassed, dropped his hands, and guiltily looked at the whitish stripes, the traces of his fingers, imprinted on Liudmila's left cheek. Liudmila took advantage of his confusion. She rapidly pulled his shirt off his shoulders down to his elbows. Sasha came to his senses, tried to pull away from her, but it turned out even worse for him-Liudmila nimbly jerked the sleeves from his arms, and the shirt fell down to his waist. Sasha felt the cold and a new rush of shame, clear and merciless, which caused his head to spin. Now Sasha was exposed to his waist. Liudmila held him firmly by the hand, and with a trembling hand slapped him several times on his naked back, then looked into his lowered and, beneath the blue-black eyelashes, strangely twinkling eyes.40 39See discussion in S. D. Cioran, "Introduction," in Petty Demon, ed. Barker, 17-18. 40Sologub, Melkii bes, 237.</page><page sequence="11">58 David M Bethea This is really the climax of the Sasha-Liudmila relationship. Though they both break down in tears due to their respective struggles-Sasha from shame and Liudmila from her young god's momentary recalcitrance-within a few paragraphs Sasha begins to understand the depth of Liudmila's feelings and Liudmila confides to him her pagan profession defoi. The experience is not presented in any way as a "deflowering" of Sasha by the older aggressor; if anything, it brings them both closer to an impossible, because finally unfulfillable, desire. There is no room, no space, for the relationship to develop beyond this status of the young Dionysus naked to the waist in the presence of his adoring female worshiper/bacchante: "Liudmila hastily kissed Sasha's arms from his shoulders to his fingers, and Sasha didn't pull them away, now aroused, now plunged as he was in passionate and cruel dreams. Liudmila's kisses were warmed with adoration, and now it was as if not a boy, but a youthful god was being kissed in secret and trembling worship of flowering Flesh."41 By the same token, there will be no rape, no penetration, for that is not what Liudmila wants (she cannot in any event "enter" him) or what (though he has intimations) Sasha is capable of. Thus, as the inner logic of these scenes seems to dictate, the pyl' that is in Sasha's name (Pyl'nikov) and is in the pollen-sprinkled (pollen being flowers' "dust" - "tsvetochnaia pyl"') aromas that refine and aestheticize their trysts (Liudmila uses a "raspylitel"' or atomizer to spray her scents) is the positive flip-side of Peredonov's negative "dirty" and "dusty" (pyl'nyi) world. Based on these semantic ties, some scholars have argued that Sasha and Liudmila's world is essentially no different from Peredonov's- that is, it too is demonic, fallen, a kind of alluring mirror inversion of the nedotykomka's realm, with which it alternates.42 It is also true that Sasha begins to experience demonic tendencies because of what Liudmila has awakened in him: when his aunt comes home to his "mad" cavorting about the house (while thinking about Liudmila and "what she wants" he is overcome by "wild gaiety") she accuses him of "acting possessed [by the devil]" ("besnovat'sia") and "going mad" ("besit'sia").43 Be this as it may, Sasha and Liudmila are extremely ambiguous, yet for the most part positive, figures in the novel: they are the closest of all the characters to gods (pagan ones) and the divine; they turn their dust (pyl) into beauty (flowers); they are trapped in the demiurge's prison but they try for something better; they learn a pleasure laced with pain that is not degrading but refining; and they embody an aesthetic principle that is as far as possible from social amelioration and Christian conscience (the ethical principle). Similarly, it is this version of total aestheticism in the absence of an identifiable morality that Nabokov confronts in his "lap scene" and its aftermath in Lolita. If one could identify the central difference in how Sologub and Nabokov treat the erotic foreplay-cum-aestheticization of reality in their novels it would be this: what happens to Sasha at the hands of Liudmila is, all things considered, a positive "awakening." Whether Sasha cannot physically be "abused" by this older (though still young) woman, or whether the lessons that he learns from her are the best his fallen world can yield up, 41Ibid., 239. 42See, for example, Venclova, "K demonologii," 150-55. 43Sologub, Melkii bes, 240.</page><page sequence="12">Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics 59 it is clear that their playing at the religion of Dionysus is not a conventional morality tale. If Sasha obeyed his inhibitions, succeeded in fending off Liudmila's overtures, and simply went back to being a chaste and dutiful youth, there is absolutely no indication in the text that this outcome would produce either a happier or psychically more fulfilled young protagonist. Quite the opposite. In their coming close to, or perhaps even achieving, the truth of pagan worship-the glimpsing of a god in the flesh-there is no identifiable irony. For the moment he has with Liudmila, before he becomes a hirsute, pomaded, and dumbly "penetrating" samets (male adult of the species), Sasha could be Dionysus. That seems to be Sologub's point. Not that he will not inevitably become another feckless prisoner in Peredonov's world (the Manichean theme), but that for this brief interlude he and Liudmila, celebrating the beauty of their bodies without having sex, can taste something "other." With Nabokov the issue of what Humbert does to Dolly Haze is much less ambiguous, the morality of his actions much clearer. First and foremost, by reversing the sex roles and making Humbert considerably older than Liudmila, Nabokov brings the theme of what today is termed "child abuse" much closer to the surface. Humbert knows he is a criminal and realizes the depths of his degradation (which makes him superior to Hermann in Despair"), yet the fact that he supposedly "cannot help himself' does not mitigate the crime in his ethically staunch creator's eyes. For what is not consummated in Sologub's world is in Nabokov's: first Humbert masturbates (presented with elaborate verbal pyrotechnics and circumlocution-a parody of aesthetic foreplay45) as he "safely solipsizes" his prey on the sofa, then he eventually has sex with Lolita after her mother has died and he has "captured" her for the night (to be repeated again and again elsewhere) at the Enchanted Hunters hotel. The point is that by displacing the real Dolly to a safe solipsistic remove and making her permanently into Lolita Humbert has affirmed the girl's semi- divine, semi-daemonic status by denying her her personhood: she exists not as amoral foreplay, where both parties participate equally in the pagan worship, but as the unwitting (hence manipulated) situational rhyme partner with Annabel. In effect, Nabokov takes Sologub and moralizes him by showing the inherent dangers in using other human beings as material to realize one's private dreams (the zhiznetvorchestvo theme), whether "wet" or innocent, no matter how refined or verbally dressed out. Nabokov also builds off the dangerous inwardness of the situation by linking it directly to masturbation (solipsistic behavior = playing with oneself) and then, eventually, to actual sex, penetration, which Lolita complains of as hurting her (first physically but then, and more pervasively, emotionally, psychologically): 44"I am unable to foresee and to fend inevitable attempts to find in the alembics of Despair something of the rhetorical venom that I injected in a much later novel. Hermann and Humbert are alike only in the sense that two dragons painted by the same artist at different periods of his life resemble each other. Both are neurotic scoundrels, yet there is a green lane in Paradise where Humbert is permitted to wander at dusk once a year; but Hell shall never parole Hermann" (Vladimir Nabokov, "Foreword," Despair [New York, 1965], 9). 45Nabokov, Annotated Lolita, 59: "I want my learned readers to participate in the scene I am about to replay; I want them to examine its every detail and see for themselves how careful, how chaste, the whole wine-sweet event is if viewed with what my lawyer has called, in a private talk we had, 'impartial sympathy."'</page><page sequence="13">60 David M. Bethea It was something quite special, that feeling: an oppressive, hideous constraint as if I were sitting with the small ghost of somebody I had just killed. As she was in the act of getting back into the car, an expression of pain flitted across Lo's face. It flitted again, more meaningfully, as she settled down beside me. No doubt, she reproduced it that second time for my benefit. Foolishly, I asked her what was the matter. "Nothing, you brute," she replied. "You what?" I asked. She was silent. Leaving Briceland. Loquacious Lo was silent. Cold spiders of panic crawled down my neck. This was an orphan. This was a lone child, an absolute waif, with whom a heavy-limbed, foul-smelling adult had had strenuous intercourse three times that very morning. Whether or not the realization of a lifelong dream had surpassed all expectation, it had, in a sense, overshot its mark - and plunged into a nightmare. .. "You chump," she said, sweetly smiling at me. "You revolting creature. I was a daisy-fresh girl, and look what you've done to me. I ought to call the police and tell them you raped me. Oh, you dirty, dirty old man." Was she just joking? An ominous hysterical note rang through her silly words. Presently, making a sizzling sound with her lips, she started complaining of pains, said she could not sit, said I had torn something inside her. ... She appeared at last [from the filling-station restroom]. "Look," she said in that neutral voice that hurt me so, "give me some dimes and nickels. I want to call mother in that hospital. What's the number?" "Get in," I said. "You can't call that number." "Why?" "Get in and slam the door." She got in and slammed the door. The old garage man beamed at her. I swung onto the highway. "Why can't I call my mother if I want to?" "Because," I answered, "your mother is dead."46 The irony everywhere present in Nabokov is totally absent in Sologub (at least with regard to the Liudmila-Sasha episodes). This irony is felt because there is obviously a dissonance between the point of view of Humbert and that of the implied author. Earlier, during the Sunday sofa scene, Humbert's behavior had been precisely not "chaste" (despite his disclaimers); indeed, such phrases as "learned readers" lend themselves to the somewhat buffoonish, tongue-in-cheek tone, as if at some level Humbert does not believe himself (which is probably true). Now again, at this crucial juncture in the text (intercourse has finally been accomplished, Part Two is about to begin), Humbert's words constantly comment ironically on themselves. His jocose melodrama and overstatement ("small ghost," "Loquacious Lo," "cold spiders," "absolute waif," "heavy, limbed, foul-smelling adult," and so on), which might seem in other circumstances to take the edge off the seriousness of the moment, here only cause us to see through their smokescreen to the real pain being glossed underneath. On the very day that Humbert realizes his obsession by crossing the final boundary, "[tearing] something inside her" through his brute act of penetration, he informs her of the actual condition of her orphanhood, and in so doing tears something else inside her. He has, in a cruelly literalized metaphor, "overshot [his] 46Ibid., 142-43.</page><page sequence="14">Sologub, Nabokov, and the Limits of Decadent Aesthetics 61 mark." What is more, Lolita now has "absolutely nowhere else to go" except back into the clutches of her captor, the "pentapod monster."47 In conclusion, we might say that the pyl' that is the dust and dirt of Peredonov's realm but also the pollen and flowering scents of Liudmila's and Pyl'nikov's has become the "haze" (the unfortunate Dolly's and Charlotte's surname) of Humbert's enchanted, but deeply immoral (not amoral) story. Indeed, if Sasha's counterpart in Lolita is the young heroine, then Humbert's partner in Sologub is not so much Liudmila as Peredonov himself-a more refined and cultured and, yes, occasionally sympathetic Peredonov, but still one trapped in his own obsessions and blindly buffeted about by his lower urges. The grotesque and ontologically tautological "Double Don" (Pered6nov) has become the innerly beastly and identically two-beat, tetrasyllabic "Humbert Son of Humbert"(Himbert HUimbert).48 Likewise, Symbolism/Decadence, zhiznetvorchestvo, and Russia have given way to post-symbolism, the morning after, and a Nova Zembla called America. The hazy, pseudo-exculpatory logic (after all, the miscreant does deserve one evening a year in the alleyways of Paradise) and alluring language (comic and lyric by turns) of Humbert's cautionary tale ostensibly belong to the madman in his cell. But the sure sense we readers get that this tale is cautionary and that the place Humbert's hypertrophied longings must go is, despite the aesthetic foreplay, where they must always go in such cases belongs to the enveloping sanity of Humbert's creator. More to the point, the very vulgarity, poshlost', that lies at the heart of Humbert's lifelong project-for what is poshlost' in Nabokov's mind if not the penchant for dragging others into one's indecent and all-too-predictable dreams?-is the same profound lack of originality that confuses the hero with the author49 (also Sologub's problem) and condemns the text as pornographic when what it is is a masterfully executed send-up of the expectations that go with literary titillation. This, the poshlost' embedded in much symbolist zhiznetvorchestvo, is what Nabokov took from Sologub, the exquisite aesthete, and turned on its head. And the symbolist magic moment, the coming of a Beautiful Lady or Sophia (an eroticized Holy Wisdom) to a uniquely privileged mortal? It is nothing more and nothing less than a coming of the most basic biological sort. Thus, if in The Petty Demon the one bright spot is the young Dionysus and his bacchante before they become the same defiled lovers as Peredonov and Varvara, then in Lolita the picture of the young nymph, no matter how mesmerizing to the hunter, simply cannot exist in the reader's eye without the countervailing image of the "hugely pregnant" and soon-to-die Mrs. Richard F. Schiller. The phrase "Lolita had been safely solipsized," surely the most pregnant in the novel, was rendered tellingly by Nabokov himself in the 1967 Russian 47Ibid., 144, 286. 48As Nabokov says in his 1964 Playboy interview, "the double rumble is, I think, very nasty, very suggestive. It is a hateful name for a hateful person. It is also a highly kingly name, but I did need a royal vibration for Humbert the Fierce and Humbert the Humble. Lends itself also to a number of puns" (cited in Nabokov, AnnotatedLolita, 321-22). 49See, for example, Skonchenaia, "Otchaianie V. Nabokova i Melkii bes F. Sologuba," 142, where the scholar explains how both Adamovich and Sartre, identifying/confusing the hero of Despair (Hermann) with the author in their moral judgment of the latter, show themselves criminally "drawn into the world of Nabokov's obedient characters" (okazalis' vtianuty v mir poslushnykh nabokovskikh personazhei).</page><page sequence="15">62 David M Bethea version as "Real'nost' Lolity byla blagopoluchno otmenena"50-"Lolita's reality had been safely cancelled out." It is this cancelling out that lies behind all the intertextual gamesmanship and gives to the work what could otherwise be mistaken for mockingbird lightness and brightness a true humanity and moral gravitas. 5ONabokov, Lolita, 49.</page></plain_text>
