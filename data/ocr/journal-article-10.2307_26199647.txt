AL FARUQI Georgetown University, Washington DC Although the nature of political identity has been vigorously debated among Muslims since the rise of Islam, their debate has not informed the Orientalist presentation of the subject. The Orientalist attitude is summed up in W. Montgomery Watt's remark: in the Islamic world, the concepts implicit in men's practice are more important than the writings of political theorists',1 thus reducing with a single sweep of the pen all Muslim thought to sheer fantasy. A comparable attitude in respect of Orientalist accounts of the formative period of Islamic law has been challenged by modern scholarship.2 However, the presenta tion of Islamic political identity continues to be shaped by the basic postulates of Orientalist dogma.3 Those postulates are: Islam started as a tribal ideology; it clashed with Judaism; it eventually transformed 1 W. Montgomery Watt, Islamic Political Thought (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1987), p. x. Similar views are expressed by other Orientalists, just too many to list here deriding the 'confusion' of the Prophet or of Islam in general. Not so long ago, to cite two examples in one, von Grunebaum (Modern Islam (Vintage Books, 1964), 7-8) quoted with approval from Kroeber, who 'characterized the Islamic message as a reduction and a simplification of the religious concepts of the contemporary faiths, particularly of Christianity', and himself averred that 'Islam [is] more realistic but also more vulgar [an] adjustment to the world' as it adopts a simplistic 'discarding of the intricacies of Trinitarianism ... [ which is] the recourse of a certain primitive rationalism'... and so on. 2 See e.g. Muhammad Mustapha A'zami, On Shacht's Origins of Mubammadan Jurisprudence (New York: Wiley, 1985). 3 I use 'Orientalism' to mean the ideological discourse that formed the basis for the study of Islam in the Western world from (at least) the nineteenth century. It has been generally disavowed and critically evaluated in recent years: see Edward Said, Orientalism (New York: Pantheon Books, 1978), for a general discussion of Orientalism in literary criticism; Asaf Hussain, Robert Olson, Jamil Qureshi (eds.) Orientalism, Islam and Islamists (Brattleboro, Vt: Amana, 1984) deals more with scholarly approaches, as does my 'From Orientalism to Islamic Studies' in Religion and Education, 25/1-2 (1998) 20-9.

AL FARUQI itself into a religion with ideals fabricated by a few ivory-tower theologians detached from the reality, the actual beliefs and practices, of the Muslim community. In this paper, the basis and frame work supporting this dogma are examined and evaluated. At the same time, the concept of political identity expressed in the term umma is elaborated through analysis of the Qur'anic text and the formative historical context. I. ISLAM: A TRIBAL IDEOLOGY? Umma: Tribe or Religious Community? That Islam started out as a nationalistic or, even more narrowly, a tribal movement is a false assumption of long standing. That assumption turns upon an understanding of the concept of umma, which, in the words of Gardet, is at the heart of the Muslim's identity.4 The word umma (sixty occurrences in the Qur'an) has as a primary meaning in Muslim literature, a religious community bound by faith and transcending all other markers of belonging. It was and remains extensively so used. This understanding was challenged in Orientalist literature, both in terms of the etymology of umma and its usage in the Qur'an. At first glance, it would seem that the Qur'an ascribes to umma widely differing meanings, ranging from 'community' to 'exemplary human being' to 'lifespan'. Generally, no comprehensive explanation is offered to account for all the meanings together—though West today. Those writers (Muslim as well as non-Muslim) who have adopted its principles and postulates can be called Orientalists, while several great Western scholars of the recent past cannot: an example is Louis Gardet, L'Islam (Paris: Desclĕe de Brouwer, 1967). 4 Ibid. 214. Gardet has an understanding of the lived dimension of the concept that survives to this day: 'II est une notion qui pendant des siĕcles a fait vibrer le coeur du musulman. II nous faut la transcrire de l'arabe, car elle garde des resonances qu'une langue europĕenne ne saurait exprimer aisĕment. C'est Yumma, ou plus exactement, Ywnmat al-nabi. La racine la plus probable d'umrna est umm, "mere". L'umma, c'est la communaute—au sens a la fois de peuple et de nation—ceux qui veulent "vivre ensemble"... A travers les divergences de pays, de races, de cultures, de langues vehiculaires, se maintient en filigrane une vocation d' unite toujours renaissante, et qui marque jusqu'au comportement quotidien.' Gardet correctly apprehends that such a notion can be common to all Muslims only if solidly grounded in their faith. Watt's understanding that, at some undefined time, the Muslims started interpreting umma in their Scripture away from its original meaning has no historical basis; but if true would not have led to such a widespread and consistent understanding throughout Islamic culture.</page><page sequence="3">qur'Anic concept of identity 3 Muslim authors have correctly explained most of them around the concept of a religious community.5 But in Orientalist literature, the seemingly disparate meanings (which, indeed, cannot be reconciled if one starts with umma as 'tribe') have led most authors simply to admit failure, with some resorting to accusing the Qur'anic text of incoherence and a definite 'confusion regarding the precise meaning of the term'.6 The Etymology of Umma Most contemporary authors7 accept Watt's thesis that umma is a synonym of qawm or 'tribe', taken in its ethnic and linguistic definition. All refuse (or ignore) the derivation of the word from the root amma as classical Arab philologists have contended. Besides Gardet, Massignon and Paret also acknowledge the essentially religious connotation of umma. However, Paret still emphasizes the 'ethnic' or 'linguistic' characteristics of the community that becomes part of a salvation plan,8 so that the primary sense is tribe with the religious dimension as a (later) add-on. Massignon on the other hand tends to agree more with the classical Arab linguists, insisting on the essentially religious connotation of the term and the community.9 The Orientalist thesis, best expressed by Watt (and adhered to thereafter on his authority), maintains that the concept of religious community (the Muslims' and Arab linguists' understanding of umma), is a late 'invention' that could not have occurred to the Prophet in a time and place where only tribal structures prevailed: conditioned to his cultural environment, the Prophet could only have conceived of tribal entities and so offered a 'nationalistic' rather than a religious ideology.10 On this premise or on the fact of limited usage of the word 5 See Naslf Nasir, Mafbiim al-umma bayna l-din wa-l-tdrikb (Beirut: Dar Amwaj, 4th edn. 1992) and Radwan al-Sayyid, al-Umma wa-l-jama'a wa-l-sulta (Beirut: Dar Iqra', 2nd edn. 1986). 6 Frederick Denny, 'The Meaning of Umma in the Qur'an' in History of Religions 15/1 (Aug. 1975), 34-70.

AL FARUQI among the Arabs of the time, some scholars11 have held that umma is a loan word from Hebrew, Aramaic or Akkadian sources, brought into Arabia through Christian and Jewish usage. Watt reasons that, since umma had only restricted usage in pre-Islamic Arabia and is present in other Semitic languages where it means 'tribe', then the word was borrowed and it must, in pre-Islamic Arabia and the Qur'an, have meant 'tribe'. But restricted usage does not imply (or, for that matter, disprove) a foreign origin.12 It indicates that the referent has become uncommon, or has come to be indicated by a different word. If umma expresses a referent that is uncommon, the hypothesis that it must mean 'tribe'— a concept common in Arabia—is void. For a loan word, it is reasonable to assume that it is borrowed to indicate something not expressible in local terms. But as umma means only 'tribe' in the other Semitic languages, it is unlikely to have been borrowed to express this mean ing. On the other hand, if the word in Arabic was an obsolete usage for 'tribe', supplanted by other words, then there must be a reason to go back to it—to infuse the concept with a new meaning that the familiar current words for 'tribe' could not hold. Watt's argument is circular and postulates, rather than explains, the origin of umma. It does not register the fact that a presence in all Semitic languages indicates a common root; nor does it consider that a word's being used in multiple shades of meaning is a sign of ease, of linguistic mastery of the various ramifications of the deriva tives associated with the root. In short, Watt's argument amounts to the absurd claim that umma is a 'foreign' word, borrowed even though it is supposed to mean simply 'tribe', and yet lacking a clear meaning in the mind of the Prophet. 11 e.g. Arthur Jeffery, The Foreign Vocabulary of the Qur'an (Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1938). Other scholars, e.g. Julius Wellhausen in The Arab Kingdom and its Fall, tr. M. Weir (Beirut: Khayyat, 1963) derive umma from umm. But umm is not a verb and if an original Semitic word must itself derive from a verb root. 12 In fact the word was not widely used in the other Semitic languages either. See the corresponding roots in A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature, compiled by Marcus Jastrow (New York: Pardes, 1950); and Lexicon in Veteris Testament Libros, ed. Ludwig Koehler (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1958). Also see Josef Horovitz, Jewish Proper Names and Derivatives in the Koran (Hilesheim: G. Olms, 1964, reprinted from Hebrew Union College Annual, 2 (1924)).

J. for his help in locating and discussing various Semitic roots.</page><page sequence="5">qur'Anic concept of identity 5 The Orientalists' Understanding of Umma in the Qur'an Did umma always mean 'tribe'? At the time of the revelation of the Qur'an, there were not only reified religions in Arabia, proselytizing and defining themselves in non-ethnic and non-tribal terms (Christians, Jews, Sabeans), but also a strong local tradition of prophets (Hud, Salih, Shu'ayb and others), whose stories were everyday fare. To claim that, at the time, the only con cept of belonging available was the 'tribe' is simply gross historical inaccuracy. Yet Watt insists the word umma could only mean 'tribe', and is always so used in the Qur'an. He produces three arguments for this thesis. According to him, the fact that the Qur'an stopped using the word after 625 ce indicates that it has no significant connotation. He conjectures (without evidence) that the Jews of Madina made fun of the word, whereupon its use in the Qur'an ceases. This argument plainly does not establish that umma means 'tribe'; and it raises more questions than it answers. Why does the Qur'an continually refer to the community of Muslims as 'the believers' (conceded by Watt), rather than use a common word that means 'tribe'?13 Why would the Jews make fun of umma if the word simply meant 'tribe' and was being so used? And why did the Prophet use it in the so-called Constitution of Madina, signed by the Jews, to refer to the Jewish tribes collectively? The strangest arguments, however, are those offered by Watt to contest Paret's affirmations that the word umma always relates to a religious context and refers to some God-fearing people. He avers that the whole of the Qur'an is religious and so the religious connota tion is not a meaningful element of the concept. One would have thought the opposite—that, in a pervasively religious text, even the word 'tribe' would acquire a religious inflection. To refute Paret's second claim, Watt finds in the Qur'an an allusion to the punishment promised to any umma that is not God-fearing. From this he infers that umma is not a religious concept since ir is referring to people 13 Watt claims that it is replaced by the word qawm. But qawm means 'group' and has to be qualified before it can mean tribe or nation or religious com munity; it is used in all these senses in the Qur'an. Watt himself notes that it has in some verses a 'distinct religious reference', though he contradicts himself a few lines later by averring that it never 'acquired a specifically religious connotation'. Worse, he quotes in support of the thesis that qawm is a 'natural' (i.e. racial or ethnic) group a verse of the Qur'an referring to a qawm of unbelievers! Their tribal bond, presumably, is unbelief!</page><page sequence="6">6 MAYSAM J. AL FARUQ1 who are not 'religious'! Again, it is the opposite that is obvious: umma is being defined with respect to belief in God or lack thereof—in and through religious terms. The umma of the unbelievers is not defined ethnically or linguistically but religiously: against the 'believers' stand the 'unbelievers' and not, say, the Persians. Watt's other argument from the Qur'an is that prophets are sent to an umma, which means that the umma existed before the coming of the Prophet, and was then an ethnic belonging. But in the Qur'an, the umam (pi. of umma) are always referred to as the umma of a particular prophet who is to be its witness on the Day of Judgement.14 It is in anticipation of the prophet that a group are referred to as an umma, as a potential umma that becomes a real one in association with its prophet: 'every time there came to an umma their apostle' (Qur'an 23. 44). On such arguments rests the Orientalist rectification of the 'fantasies' that make up Muslim political thought. Did the meaning of umma evolve in the Qur'an? In contrast to Watt, other Orientalists believe that while the Prophet's concept of community was essentially tribal, umma came eventually to assume a religious dimension. The failure of an originally tribal mission caused it to be recast in religious terms. This thesis, set out by Paret in a most confused paragraph 5 is reiterated by Denny: The most recent ummah to receive a messenger from God, according to the Qur'an is that of the Arabs. It seems that as the Medina venture matured and became strong, the earlier notion of a specifically Arab ummah evolved into one of Muslims, people who had 'submitted' to the new religion but who were increasingly led (partly because of the Jewish rejection of Muhammad's claim to prophecy) to symbolize and celebrate their specialness as a people of God in Arab terms. The resacralization of the sacred enclave in Mecca (the Ka'abah [sic]) and the command to pilgrimage are examples of this, not to 14 e.g. Qur'an 4. 41; 28. 75. All translations of the Qur'an in this paper are, except where expressly indicated otherwise, taken from The Message of the Qur'an by Muhammad Asad (Gibraltar: Dar al-Andalus, 1980), with occasional slight modification. 15 Paret, Shorter Encyclopedia: 'The Arab ummah, which Muhammad had originally taken for granted was only created by him after much hard work. If it at first represented a community of Arabs, this was more or less a secondary phenomenon. The essential thing was the religious foundation on which it was based. The ummah of the Arabs was transformed into an ummah of the Muslims.'</page><page sequence="7">qur'anic concept of identity 7 mention the dramatic change in the direction of prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca (2:142-45). The 'arabization' of Islam, in conscious terms, was a result of the prophetic career of Muhammad and not an inevitable development.16 In other words: the Muslims in Makka started with an Arab identity but (for reasons not altogether evident) turned to the concept of a wider religious belonging in Madina; then, having been rejected by the Jews, they reverted to their Arab identity, symbolized and affirmed by the establishment of Makka as the direction of prayer (qibla). It is hard to see why Arabs would stop identifying as Arabs or return to an identity that is pretty difficult to renounce in the first place, and harder still to explain why the Prophet would from the start cast a nationalistic ideology in religious terms and claim prophethood. The thesis, such as it is, hinges on the historical argument: the shift in attention and direction provoked by the Christian and Jewish rejection of Islam. To assess this argument, we need to determine the Qur'an's attitude to the various groups in Arabia that it addresses. 2. 'Muslim': Ethnic or Religions Identity? The Qur'an calls on Christians and Jews to recognize the mission of the Prophet on a religious basis, presenting it as a continuation of the earlier missions. Christians and Jews are referred to as umam, defined by their religious beliefs, and are never referred to as Arabs. If the Qur'an had in mind an Arab super-tribe, it should have emphasized their Arabness—and it never does. The Prophet's call should have been the same to all—Jews, Christians and mushrikin (Associationists)—since they were all Arabs, but it never was. The Jews' and the Christians' religious beliefs are affirmed in many respects and they are called upon to accept the new Prophet, not as an Arab, but as a continuation of these beliefs. But the religious views of the Associationists, though they are no less Arab, are never accepted. Even after the Christians and the Jews reject the Prophet, the Qur'an refers to their faiths as revealed religions, whereas the Associationists' religion is never acknowledged, however Arab they were, not even after they agreed to submit to the temporal rule of the Prophet if he would only acknowledge their gods17 as he did the (allegedly non-Arab) 1 Denny, 'Meaning of Umma\ 35-6. Emphasis added. 17 The Makkans tried to resolve their problem by offering the Prophet wealth and power if he desisted from attacking their gods. See any of the biographies of the Prophet—e.g. Muhammad b. Ishaq, Sirah Rasul Allah; in translation: Alfred Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad (London: Oxford University Press,</page><page sequence="8">8 MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI religions of the Christians and the Jews.18 If 'Arab' had been the rallying cause, all religions should at some point have been either accepted or rejected equally since their adherents were equally Arabs. It makes little sense to maintain that there was a conscious attempt by the Arab Muslims to revert to 'Arab' traditions and to 'celebrate their specialness as a people of God in Arab terms' because they were rejected by Arab Christians and Jews! Even if Christianity and Judaism did not originate in Arabia (a claim far from proven in the case of Judaism), Arabia's Jews and Christians were Arabs, sons of Arabs, and no Associationist would have dreamt of calling al-Nabigha al-Dhubyanl or al-Samaw'al non-Arabs. The Orientalists themselves acknowledge the fact when they maintain that the Prophet's call was tribal and addressed to the Christians and Jews originally on the basis of their Arab identity. However, they abruptly shift position when these Jews and Christians reject the Prophet: at that point they somehow become non-Arab. Their rejection throws the Prophet into the arms of the 'Arab' Associationists—who, though they rejected the Prophet with no less vigour, somehow retain their Arab ethnicity and lure the Prophet into (re)adopting it. The manifest inconsistency of the argument arises from the Orientalist assimilation of 'Islam' with 'Arab'. The confusion of Associationist (a religious identity) with Arab (an ethnic identity) extends also to Christianity and Judaism, sometimes seen as Arab and sometimes undeclared. It is also behind the unchallenged Orientalist dogma that a 'break' with the Jews and the Christians, after their rejection of the Prophet, allegedly provoked the institution of the pilgrimage and the change of the qibla from Jerusalem to Makka, ushering in the 'Arabization' of Islam and a change in the religious beliefs. 1955, re-edited, 1967), or Hitti, History of the Arabs (New York: St Martin's Press, 1956). 18 Although the word mushrikin is often translated as 'unbelievers' or 'pagans', it actually means in Arabic 'those who associate other gods with God' or 'Associationists'. Thus it is not 'unbelievers'; rather, it clearly designates a religion understood as such by the Qur'an, though strongly opposed by it on the basis of its strict monotheism. That it is a religious tradition (albeit not based on a scripture) is attested in the verses referring to the unbelievers from among both the people of the Book and the mushrikin: 'Those who disbelieve (kafaru) from among the People of the Book and the Associationists could not be abandoned [by God] until clear evidence came to them' (98. 1). Translation mine.</page><page sequence="9">qur'anic concept of identity 9 Confusion of religion and ethnicity The Qur'an accepts many traditions and practices from both Christianity and Judaism, and some from the pre-Islamic Associationist religion. All these are acknowledged as 'religious' traditions. Thus the Associationists invited to Islam respond by invoking the tradition of their forefathers, to which the Qur'an responds (43. 22) that its guidance is better. The adoption of the pilgrimage indicates a partial adoption of Associationism, just as the acceptance of Christian and Jewish beliefs and practices indicates a partial adoption of these reli gions. It is inconsistent to affirm that the adoption of Associationist practices is ethnically motivated while that of Christian and Jewish practices is religious. In all these cases, the Qur'an is accepting reli gious practices for, and causing them to be refitted to, its own worldview. As Fazlur Rahman pointed out,19 it applies to these different borrowings the same treatment: they are systematically disassociated from their religious background so that they refer now to 'Islamic' prophets and traditions. Abraham becomes a Hanlf, a Muslim. Jesus becomes a Muslim prophet of God. Nor can one detect here a change in the philosophy of the Qur'an, which from the start maintained that it was a continuation of the earlier messages that had been corrupted. It is true that the Prophet expected the Christians and Jews to accept his message—but he expected them to accept the Qur'anic version of their religion. The Ka'ba and the Qibla issue A major pillar of the Orientalist argument is that the reorientation of the qibla from Jerusalem to Makka was directly caused by the Jews' rejection of the Prophet. Though one can discount the 'ethnic' argument, the question remains whether this constitutes indeed the seminal 'break with the Jews'. A careful analysis of the passage relating to the qibla (2. 142-51) reveals nothing of the sort. As we do the reading, we shall see that it cannot at all be understood either as seeking religious sanction from the Jews or turning to the Associationists. Makka's importance in pre-Islamic Arabia rested on the Ka'ba, built— according to ancient Arabian tradition—by Abraham. That was the centre of the Makkan claim to pre-eminence and the reason why pilgrimage to its sanctuary was more important than to any other in Arabia. Abraham is claimed as their ancestor by most northern ly Fazlur Rahman, Islam (London: Holt, Rinehart &amp;c Winston, 1966), 20. See also his excellent discussion of this issue in Major Themes of the Qur'an (Minneapolis: Bibliotheca Islamica, 1989), 132 ff.</page><page sequence="10">IO MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI Arabs, who trace their genealogy to his son Ishmael: all his descend ants worshipped at the shrine, which housed not only symbols of Associationist gods but also Christian and Jewish symbols. In the Qur'an itself, Abraham's importance can hardly be overstated. Also, it is clear that winning over Makka for Islam remained the primary goal of the Prophet's mission even after his reluctant migration from it. Besides its religious significance, there was a tactical aim in focusing on Makka: since it was the religious centre of Arabia, its conversion would mean (as eventually it did) the quasi-total conversion of all of Arabia. In the Qur'an, Makka retains its religious place despite the Associationists' claims to it. Indeed, it is disassociated from them and linked instead with Abraham. Makka is several times emphatically called umm al-qura, or the foremost city, and the Prophet is specifically sent to reveal 'an Arabic Qur'an, that you may warn the foremost city and those around it' (42. 7). So while its principal religion is implacably attacked, Makka itself remains the heart of the Arabia that the Prophet strives to convert and its Ka'ba, built by Abraham, is the logical choice for the qibla. Jerusalem, unlike Makka, is only associated with some of Abraham's descendants and was therefore not a religious focus. The claim that Jerusalem was 'discarded' after the Jews rejected the Prophet is inconsistent with the way that the Qur'an deals with the religious elements of other traditions. If the Qur'an had wanted Jerusalem, it could simply have disassociated Jerusalem from Judaism; after all, the same had been done with Abraham and Judaism, Jesus and Christianity, and the pilgrimage to Makka and Associationism. There must have been then a major reason for indicating Jerusalem as qibla. The decision was made in Madina, and according to the Qur'an, it was on divine inspiration: 'And it is only to the end that We might make a clear distinction between those who follow the Apostle and those who turn about on their heels that We appointed [for this community] the direction of prayer which you [O Prophet] have formerly observed. This was indeed a hard test for all but those whom God has guided aright. But God is not one to let your faith be in vain' (2. 143). It is clear that 'the direction of prayer formerly observed' is Jerusalem, since it is going to be changed now to Makka. The responsibility for the decision to face Jerusalem is attributed to God and not to the Prophet—'as a hard test' for some of his followers. This could not be a test of the loyalty of Jews, for the appointment of Jerusalem as the qibla could not but ingratiate the Muslims to them. The relevant verses do address the Jews—but not only them. They also address those 'who turn about on their heels'. Since the Jews had never recognized the Prophet as such they cannot be the referent</page><page sequence="11">qur'Anic concept of identity II of 'those who turn about on their heels'. There are clearly two distinct groups affected by the change of the qibla, only one of whom was tested by having Jerusalem be the qibla for a while. That group was the Hanlfs. Hanlfism centred on Abraham, and the Ka'ba was therefore the only house of worship for the Hanlfs. Most of them had adopted Islam, but there were doubts about some of them. In Madina, one Hanif of the Aws tribe, Abu 'Amir,20 had a sizeable following and—having aspirations of his own—resented the leadership of the Prophet. The antagonism was muted since so many Hanlfs (including his own son) had adopted Islam. Nonetheless, a challenge to Abu 'Amir's claims was inevitable as the Prophet consolidated his following in Madina. Jerusalem was set as the qibla, as a way to differentiate between Abu 'Amir's followers, who prayed towards Makka, and those who accepted the Prophet. The move was probably not meant to be con frontational and was intended to indirectly help the Prophet assert his authority over Muslims and Hanlfs alike. But Abu 'Amir, who had accused the Prophet of falsifying the 'religion of Abraham' (which, it should be remembered, the Prophet had proclaimed to follow), could now maintain that the Prophet did not really subscribe to Hanlfism since he had assigned Jerusalem as qibla instead of Abraham's house of worship. Some of the Madinan Hanlfs who had accepted Islam made that very point to the Prophet and continued to pray towards Makka. It is then as a gesture of reconciliation towards the Hanlfs that the Qur'an modified the qibla, explaining the change to Jerusalem as a temporary trial: the commitment to Hanlfism, proclaimed from the start as a true religion, had not changed, and the Hanlfs were clearly told that there had been no intention 'to let your faith be in vain'. The Ka'ba is restored to preeminence, 'so that people should have no argument [any more] against you unless they are bent upon wrongdoing'. However, since this change might distress the Jewish community, the Qur'an explains that God provides different 'ways' with new revelations: there is no slight to the followers of earlier traditions, their religious practices are still honoured—'for every community faces a direction of its own, of which He is the focal point'—and they may follow their own religious practices. As for the Hanlfs, with whom the Prophet had identified and who were therefore much more important than the Jews to his mission, the Qur'an is saying in effect that, the argument of the qibla being settled in their favour, they 'have no argument against' the Prophet any more, 20 Muhammad b. Ishaq, Sirah Rasul Allah; Til ff.</page><page sequence="12">12. MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI so it will be clear who will still follow the Prophet's call and who will try to find new pretexts to 'turn about on their heels'. The whole passage can now be read as a coherent argument. It is prefaced (verse 135) with the crucial claim of endorsing Hanlfism rather than Christianity and Judaism, followed by the reminder that the Muslims do accept earlier revelations (verse 136) in their own way since 'Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob' were not 'Jews and Christians', contrary to what their followers say who do not know 'more than God does' (verse 140). And they say: 'Be Jews' or 'Christians', and you shall be on the right path.' Say: 'Nay, but [ours is] the creed of Abraham the Hanlf [millata Ibrahim Hanlfan], and he was not of the mushrikln [ 135], Say: We believe in God... and earlier revelations [136-9]... Do you [Christian and Jews] claim that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their descendants were Jews or Christians?' Say 'Do you know better or God?'... [140]... The weak-minded among people will say, 'What has turned them away from the direction of prayer which they have hitherto observed?' Say: 'God's is the east and the west. He guides whom He wills onto a straight way' [142]... And it is only to the end that We might make a clear distinction between him who follows the Apostle and him who turns about on his heels that We appointed [for this community] the direction of prayer which you [O Messenger] have formerly observed: for this was indeed a hard test for all but those whom God has guided aright. But God is not one to let your faith be in vain... [143]... Turn, then, your face towards [the Ka'ba ... in prayer]. And those who were given earlier revelations know that this command comes in truth from God... [144] And yet, even if you were to place all signs before [them], they would not follow your direction of prayer; and neither may you follow their direction of prayer, nor do they even follow one another's direction. And if you were to follow their ways after the knowledge [of this command] that has been given to you, you would surely be of the evildoers [145]... Be not, then, among the doubters, for every community faces a direction of its own, of which He is the focal point. Vie therefore with one another in doing good works ... [148]... and wherever you all may be, turn your faces towards [the Ka'ba] so that people should have no argument [any more] against you unless they are bent upon wrongdoing [150]. There is then a 'break' with the Jews, but only as an indirect consequence of the need to reconcile the Hanlfs. Their endorsement was crucial, since the Qur'an presented Islam as a direct continuation of Hanlfism, and only an indirect continuation of Christianity and Judaism as interpreted by their followers. To soften the negative impact of the break, reconciliation and tolerance are offered on the pattern of 'to you your religion and to me mine'. This approach was not feasible with the Hanlfs, since the Qur'an was claiming the same creed as theirs</page><page sequence="13">qur'Anic concept of identity 13 and no distancing from them was possible. Instead, the Hanlfs are provided with a sort of ultimatum: their concerns having been met, they 'should have no argument [any more] against [the Prophet] unless they are bent upon wrongdoing'. The Qur'an now expects from them what it did not expect from the Jews, namely unequivocal acceptance of Islam. Given the religious importance of Makka and Abraham, the Ka'ba ('truly the first house of worship set for mankind... where Abraham stood' (3. 96)) was bound to be restored. Neither ethnicity nor the mythical 'break with the Jews' has anything to do with the change of the qibla. II. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISLAM AND EARLIER RELIGIONS 1. The Christian Paradigm in Orientalist Literature There is no basis for the claim that the Prophet could not, from the first, have conceived of a religious belonging; nor for the claim that he started out with and then, following the Jews' rejection of him, reverted to, a tribal conception of community. There was no rupture with the Jews that functioned as a turning-point, forcing a change of direction (symbolized in the change of qibla). Making the Jews' rejection of the Prophet a crux has been read into the history of Islam from Christian experience: a prophet (Messiah) is sent, the Jews reject him; he sets out to the 'Gentiles' and brings about a new tradition. That paradigm does not correspond at all to the historical situation in the formative period of Islam. It is clear that the predicament of Jesus is radically different from that of the Prophet. Jesus's mission was directed at his people, the Jews. Not only did he preach among them, but the gospels also attest to the fact that he directed his mission to the House of Israel. The Prophet, on the other hand, started preaching among the Associationists, and throughout his life they remained his main audience. To understand and explain a message, we need to take account of its primary audience. The idea of the Prophet presenting himself to the Associationists as a prophet of the Jews is absurd—they had already rejected that religious tradition. Why in any event would he consider himself a prophet of the Jews or of the Christians (or, worse, of both at once), when he did not belong to either community? How could he plausibly claim to speak to the Jews from within their tradition when he never subscribed to it? And why do so in order to appeal to the Associationists, his</page><page sequence="14">14 MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI main audience? It is conceivable for a prophet to appeal from and to an earlier tradition of his own people (as Jesus did for the Jews, and as, indeed, the Prophet did with Hanlfism, which had emerged from within Associationism), but to appeal to them from another religious tradition, and one, moreover, that they had specifically rejected (6. 157-8)? Surely, there must be a better way to establish to one's people one's prophetic credentials? The Orientalists' main reason for applying the Christian paradigm (besides being conditioned to their cultural environment) is that the Qur'an alludes to biblical material. This has then been read by them as a flawed subscription to Judaism and Christianity. That reading is wrong on two counts. First, there is a clear distinction between reporting material and its interpretation: thus Christianity builds on biblical material but provides a clearly different interpretation of it, just as the Old Testament builds on ancient Mesopotamian traditions but from its own perspective. Secondly, it is wrong to suppose that the Qur'an is drawing on religious material that 'belongs' to the Christians and the Jews, and so is 'foreign' in Arabia. Most of the so-called 'biblical' stories were well known and spread throughout the Semitic world. The stories of Abraham (the presumed ancestor of the Arabs), Ishmael, Noah, Job, and others were part of the common cultural stock and antedated both Christianity and Judaism. As to specifically Christian and Jewish precepts, these—though not part of the Associationists' beliefs—were still held by a relatively large number in Arabia and so part of the Arabian scene. The Prophet's own tribe and background were solidly rooted in Associationism, and to some extent, in Hanlfism. But both Christianity and Judaism had emerged in the Semitic world (with Judaism probably developing in Arabia proper), so it is absurd to consider them as having been 'foreign'. Christianity spread first amongst speakers of Aramaic and Arabic. Contacts between the Arab Fertile Crescent and Arabia proper had always been maintained. What would be strange is if the new religion had not built on the available heritage, as viewed and modified by its own perspective. It makes no more sense to present Islam as a mangled and flawed rehashing of Christianity than to present Christianity as a mangled and flawed rehashing of Judaism. The fact that the Qur'an claims to follow Christianity and Judaism does not indicate that it subscribes to either. It claims both traditions but the differences between the two (something of which the Qur'an (2.113) is quite aware) did not allow continuation of both at the same time. If either Christians or Jews had been the primary audience of the new message, then certainly, claiming to them to speak in the name of both Christianity and Judaism at once would be tantamount</page><page sequence="15">qur'anic concept of identity 15 to prophetic suicide. As to the Associationists, the primary audience of the Prophet, they had rejected both Christianity and Judaism. To then claim continuity with these required a rationale quite different from that of Jesus addressing his own religious community, the Jews. There were essential similarities between the new monotheism and its earlier forms. Such similarities (as well as important divergences) had to be explained to the target audience, and a new claim to monotheism could not but acknowledge its precursors. Because the Prophet accepted Judaism and Christianity as similar religious claims he expected Jews and Christians to accept him in return. But he did not claim to follow them; rather, he claimed to include and transcend their traditions. That is why he was able to claim both at once and neither in particular. The Qur'an had to explain the new differences from, and the old differences between, the two earlier traditions. It attributes the latter to merely human conjectures and errors interpolated into and distorting the original, central message. The Prophet, then, was not presenting himself to the Associationists as a new prophet of the Jews but as a new prophet to all, with a new message centred on the Associationists. As such he spoke from outside the Christian and Jewish traditions. His message was the one that 'solved' the differences between Jews and Christians, over which they argued interminably amongst them selves and with each other (2. 113). Their essential monotheism is accepted, but so too their criticism of each other: the claims of exclusive divine chosenness and of the divinity of Christ are equally rejected. It is only because it presents itself from outside, neither addressed to the Jews nor to the Christians, that the new message could be portrayed both as new and as a continuation, bringing together the similarities and differences of the earlier traditions, while primarily addressing the Associationists. 2. The Relationship hetiveen Islam and Associationism The three main religious traditions of Arabia, namely, Christianity, Judaism and Associationism are too different for Islam to present itself as a continuation of all three. The new message will be based on one of these, and it is only normal that the Prophet would claim his own tradition, namely Associationism. Most of the practices and claims of the latter are accepted but with the new interpretation brought about by the Hanlfs. The fact that the Associationists will all become Muslims has obscured the visceral link between Associationism and the Prophet. If he had presented himself as belonging to the other traditions, he might have obtained no hearing at all. Thus the Qur'an (29. 45-8) assures them that the Prophet belongs to neither of the</page><page sequence="16">MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI other religions, and that he had no previous commitment to their doctrines: And do not argue with the followers of earlier revelation otherwise than in a most kindly manner... and say 'We believe in what has been revealed to us as well as that which was revealed to you, for our God and your God is one and the same and it is unto Him that we surrender ourselves. [46] For it is thus that We have bestowed this divine writ from on high upon you [O Messenger], Some of those to whom it is sent believe in it; and so do some of the others [who received earlier revelations]. And none could knowingly reject Our messages except the unbelievers. [47] And you did not [O Messenger] before this message recite or transcribe one with your own hand—else those who are trying to disprove you might indeed have had cause to doubt [48]. The last verse cited (29. 48) is traditionally taken by Muslims to indicate the Prophet's ignorance of biblical material, thus reinforcing their belief in the miraculous nature of the Qur'an. But the verse is simply affirming, for the benefit of the suspicious Makkans, that the Prophet had never subscribed to Christian or Jewish traditions and that this is a revelation specific to them: "You were not [O Muhammad] present [at Mount Sinai] when We imposed the Law upon Moses... neither did you dwell among the people of Madyan, conveying Our messages unto them... but you are sent as an act of your Lord's mercy to warn a people to whom no warner has come before you....' (28.44-6). The Qur'an is thus addressed to a particular group, identified not as 'Arab' but as a people without scripture—and those could only be the Associationists, who had a religious tradition but no scripture. However, its message also meant to be inclusive (thus claiming earlier revelations and integrating them in its history of revelation) and not exclusive of, or threatening to, existing groups. Accordingly, there are overtures towards the Christians and the Jews, with whom the Muslims are instructed to engage with civility. For, while it maintains its own interpretation of their scriptures, the Qur'an (5. 48, also 22. 34) always maintains the validity in God's eyes of the Christians' and Jews' distinct practices, beliefs, and way of life: 'And to each of you We have determined a religious path and a religious law; and if God had so willed, He would have made you all into one community; but [He did not do so] in order that He may try all of you in what He has given you. Vie with one another then in good deeds' (5. 48). Muhammad's message is then grounded solidly in the Associationist base, a base it needs in order to take root and spread about. If the Associationists are not posited as the primary audience of the Qur'an, the interpretation of the text cannot but be severely distorted. But the mistake of reading Christian historical experience into Islamic</page><page sequence="17">qur'anic concept of identity !7 history by positing the Jews as the primary audience of the Qur'an does not arise from any lack of similarities between the religious missions of Jesus and the Prophet. Some of the characteristics of the former can be found in the latter. Both justified their message on the authority of their people's existing religious beliefs. Thus Jesus uses Jewish scriptures—but relies on a contemporary interpretation of them, which sets him against their more conservative guardians. Similarly, the Prophet appeals to the Associationists—but relies on a contemporary interpretation (namely, Hanlfism, the latest offshoot of their tradition), which sets him against the conservative guardians of the Ka'ba. Such similarities correspond to a universal, rational pattern: a reformer arises from within his community, seeking justifica tion from their 'misinterpreted' past. The error of the Orientalists (from which so much of the misrepresentation of Islamic history and theology has flowed) was to have transposed the particulars of forma tive Christian history and not its general characteristics. III. RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL IDENTITY: TERMS AND CONTEXT Before moving on to discuss the concept of identity in the QurJan itself, it is necessary to define the terms to be used in the discussion in order to avoid the inconsistencies of the Orientalist discourse. 1. Identity and Identification According to Watt, ethnic and religious identity can be assimilated in the case of Islam. But these are very different. The primary marker defining tribal belonging is a given, anthropomorphic trait (ancestry, ethnicity, culture, language, laws and customs). Of these, natural traits are given and can never be acquired. A Tamil may learn Arabic and live with Arabs but he cannot deny his Tamil ancestry. An ideology based on a given natural trait is fundamentally different from one based on traits that can be acquired or elected. In the case of Islam, the Qur'an does not restrict the new religion to Arab or any other ethnicity. The Prophet, who had sent his missionaries to the leaders of Abyssinia and Byzantium, and among whose Companions non-Arabs were prominent and respected figures, was clearly thinking of a universal following. There is, of course, reference in the Qur'an to an umma of Muslims. Both Watt and Denny take that as a restrictive conception since it</page><page sequence="18">l8 MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI includes only Muslims.21 But such restriction is a matter of semantics. An Arab Associationist or a Christian or a Jew is self-evidently outside the Muslim umma. This is a matter of inevitable designation, just as 'humankind' does not include 'monkeys'. Are the Christians a 'tribe' because they do not include Buddhists? In other words, there is a difference between identity and identification. A physical characteristic provides identity by necessity and one cannot but be, say, male or female, white or black, Russian or Nigerian. Religion on the other hand is a system of belief that is elected. This is voluntary identifica tion and it cannot be assimilated to a physical characteristic. A tribal or ethnic bond is "given" (even if one chooses to ignore it), but a bond of faith is "entered upon". To assimilate umma and tribe (as Watt does, making the umma a super-tribe made of 'Muslims' rather than 'Arabs' or Aryans') is absurd unless there is a way to define 'Muslim' in terms of natural traits. The recipients of the Qur'an are not an ethnically defined group, not Arabs as such, but a people without scripture. Nonetheless, it explicitly refers to itself as clear Arabic speech, and maintains that line consistently. But this too is not an ethnic appeal. The Qur'an is addressed to a cultural context, the reality of which it straightforwardly acknowledges. It is sent to Arabic speaking people, so it is in Arabic. This recognition of local context is not the same as an ethnic restriction. One could, for example, being French, conceive and issue a 'universal' declaration of human rights that is, though in French, not billed as French, nor requires allegiance to any sort of French 'tribalism'. The given local context is simply a necessary constraint that cannot be negated. The relation of the Qur'an to its context was exploited by the Makkans to maintain (like the Orientalists) that such an identity was a limitation that must preclude a claim to a universal divine source, which (for them) could only be proven through miracles of the kind they kept demanding. To this the Qur'an (41. 44) responded sharply: 'Had We made this a non-Arabic Qur'an, they would have then said: "Why are its verses not clear? How is that, a non-Arabic [Qur'an] and an Arab [prophet]!" ' The Qur'an acknowledged its given context, underlining in that response the absurdity of denying it. The given identity embedded in local context can also be used as a basis of identification—that is the essence of tribalism, racism, etc. However, while one cannot deny one's 'tribe' or 'race', one is free not to make it a source of identification. An ideology or a religion is always a source of identification, which may or may not use a source 21 Denny, 'Meaning of Umma\ 36.</page><page sequence="19">qur'Anic concept of identity 19 of identity as its basis. A religion that claims universality cannot base its 'identification1 on a given natural trait, though it can still acknowl edge its local cultural context or identity. A Persian Christian is Christian even though Christianity spread first among Aramaic- and Arabic speaking people. Similarly, a Muslim is a Muslim regardless of the background of Islam, since the Qur'an does not make a claim of allegiance to 'Arabness' that could restrict 'Muslim'. Nor can one say that this allegiance is implicitly assumed: a system of identification clarifies its source and makes it explicit, for its main aim is to elicit allegiance. 2. Identity in Pre-Islamic Arabia Social identity in pre-Islamic Arabia was provided by relations with and between tribes, made up of clans descended from a common ancestor. These tribes were fiercely independent and followed laws and traditions specific to themselves. Nevertheless, there was clearly an awareness of a larger ethnic identity defined by language; within this category, a difference was made between the Arab and the musta'riba tribes of the north who—according to tradition—acquired the Arabic dialect at a later date. In addition, there was a religious identity, separate from both ethnic and tribal identity. Each tribe had its own ancestor who provided it with its name, and each subscribed to the religion of its choice—namely, Christian or Jewish or, for the majority, Associationist. Each tribe may also have had, in the vein of earlier Mesopotamian tradition, its own protecting 'god' (with due recognition of a distinct creator god). However, by the time of the Prophet, only the important cities claimed individual gods—such as Makka and its god Hubal. The nomadic tribes mainly worshipped the creator god, Allah, and the sun and moon gods.22 The tendency of members of a tribe to subscribe to the same religion is not part of the definition of the religion—rather, it is the result of normal social influences within the same group. There were also individuals who claimed their own religion within their tribe, as was the case with the Hanlfs. In that there was no compulsion in Arabian society to subscribe to a certain creed, we can label the religious identity as a personal identity. None of these identities—personal-religious, tribal-social, linguistic ethnic—was able to support, on the basis of a shared reference, a shared political order. This lack was evident in the grave social problems 22 For pre-Islamic beliefs, see G. Ryckmans, Les Religions arabes preislamiques (Louvain, 1951). Also Hitti, History of the Arabs.</page><page sequence="20">2.0 MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI remarked and addressed in the Qur'an.23 With no inter-tribal legal order, the system of revenging raids or killings had led to endless wars that were taking their toll on the populace. The only way to protect oneself was through alliances with powerful tribes that might deter a potential enemy from aggression. This in turn led to tribal coalitions that could then impose their terms on others, especially concerning caravan routes. Thus the divisions became ever more polarized and wealth less equally distributed. The dissatisfaction of the poorer, weaker segments (clans or tribes) of the populace was one of the major reasons for the success of the social reform that was an important dimension of Islam. That Islam did include social reform is evident from the social and economic laws it instituted. But on what could social reform be based in order to win the allegiance of all? The Arab ethnic identity could not serve this purpose, at least not initially. It could and did emerge only when the Arabs faced non-Arabs-Persians or Byzantines, for example. Thus the Arab Christians joined in battle on the side of the Muslims on the strength of their common ethnic (linguistic) heritage, though they refused to accept the faith.24 The social-tribal identity (being defined through a close common ancestor) was far too restrictive to be broadened to include all the tribes. Of course, one could go back to Abraham, father of all Arab tribes whether Jewish (through Isaac) or Christian and Associationist (through Ishmael). To some extent, both Hanlfism and Islam did just that, but they used Abraham as a religious rather than an ethnic figure. Since all tribes already claimed him, it was hard to use him otherwise than as the source and symbol of an ethnic identity that would be roused only if and when confronted by another ethnic identity. A super-tribe (or 'nation') might be forged over time by one of the tribes through force of arms or through a sustained external threat to all tribal entities. In the Arabia of the time, however, the individual tribal identities were too powerful and well marked to be simply transcended on tribal 23 The Qur'an refers to many of these ills: infanticide, raids, vendettas, the absence of a law that would punish criminals protected by the tribal bond, etc. The social situation in Arabia before Islam is referred to by every commentator on the Qur'an in the discussion of the relevant verses. Al-Azraql's Akhbdr Makka (Makka: Matabi' Dar al-Thaqafah, 1965), is a very good source of information, as is Al-Agharil by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahanl Beirut: Dar al-Thaqafah, 11955-1964], Hitti, History of the Arabs, provides a short, useful summary in English. 24 T. W. Arnold, The Preaching of Islam (Lahore: Sh. Muhammad Ashraf, repr. 1979), 45-52.</page><page sequence="21">qur'Anic concept of identity 21 terms. A single tribe could not impose its own identity system on all others. Instead, as we noted, tribes formed competing coalitions, each serving its own interests, with the most powerful of them imposing their rules on others. This was hard for customarily independent tribes to submit to, and therefore could not work for long. More importantly, it could not provide a programme for a new order, for new socio economic relations and laws. Tribalism served tribes and their specific interests, not other tribes. Tribal identity could not provide for disinterested inter-tribal law. That could only come from a reform pro gramme whose authority transcended and was recognized by all tribes, but could not be claimed as the exclusive belonging of any particular tribe. That left religious identity as the only one on which to base an ideology of reform.25 Associationism, with its 'tribal' emphasis on more than one god and hence more than one reference and identity, could not serve the purpose. Judaism had its own form of tribal restrictiveness, and moreover it was not strongly given to proselytizing. Christianity, viable in both those respects, was tied to its concept of the Trinity, which, even in its variant interpretations, clashed with the prevailing Semitic background. The only source of religious identifica tion remaining was Hanlfism, whose strict monotheism affirmed a single transcendent source of authority, and whose simple, clear moral message was firmly secured by its belief in an inevitable Day of Judgement. This familiar creed did prove capable of broadening into a new source of religious identification, which in turn provided the basis (and the motive) for a new social and political order. With the sanction of divine will, a unitary source of law above the particular tribal laws that had led to unending conflicts, it was possible to establish the new social laws—for example, forbidding inter-tribal feuding and usury, enjoining common poor-taxes—in definite and absolute terms that could not be claimed by any single tribe. Islam's religious mission included a clear socio-economic programme that attracted the discontented (the poor, the weak, and the alienated) to the new order. That order could not have been founded (as the Orientalists argue) on tribal or ethnic identities. It could only have been founded, as it was, on a 'universal' religious source of identification. The rise of Hanlfism and the intellectual weakening of Associationism 25 A pre-Islamic example is the pact known as hilf al-fudul. This proved a vain attempt to limit commercial and tribal abuse—except that it left a lasting impression on the future Prophet who, though a youth, attended the meeting with other representatives of the Hashim clan.</page><page sequence="22">22 MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI at the time made the defeat of the latter relatively easy. As for the ethnic (Arab) identity, it was weak to begin with, and, in the event, the Arabization of the new empire proceeded so swiftly that it did not pose much of a challenge to the new religion. The tribal identity, however, being so entrenched in Arabia, proved most difficult to contain. The Prophet's new religion did not conquer it for long: the virulence of the internecine war that convulsed the caliphate during the rule of 'Uthman and 'All attests to its staying power. It was only over a very long time that the tribal identity, outweighed but not erased by the religious identification, would finally be diminished—thanks in large part, no doubt, to non-Arab converts. Be that as it may, the only reason it could be diminished at all was precisely because the basis of identity in the Qur'an was not tribal and ethnic. IV. POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS IDENTITY IN THE QUR'AN We can now derive the concept of political and religious identity in the Qur'an through an account of, first, the root meaning of umma and its important connotations, and then of ten different usages of umma in the Qur'an. 1. Umma: The Root and its Connotations The word umma is listed in Lisan al-'arab, the thirteenth-century dictionary, under the root amma or amama, meaning 'to seek' or 'to go intentionally forward', 'to seek the right path': qasadahu aw qasada al-tariq al-mustaqlm or 'he sought it/him or he sought the straight path'. The amm is what is sought, possibly replacing ma'mum, as in ammahu amma. Of the two intertwined notions, the fundamental one is that of seeking (as in seeking someone or something), also expressed by qasada. The verb amma is abundantly used in this sense in pre-Islamic poetry as well as by the Companions of the Prophet (e.g. amamtu rasul Allah, meaning 'I sought God's Messenger', cited in Lisan al-'arab). From this root derives the word imam-, amma al-qawm means taqaddamahum or 'to precede them (the group)', to walk ahead of them, to lead them. Imam is then the leader, the precedent and therefore the model for the qaivm or group, their reference and the symbol of their way of life. Thus al-Nabigha, the great Christian poet of the pre-Islamic era says: 'they achieved greatness in their life 'ala imam [literally,</page><page sequence="23">qur'Anic concept of identity 2-3 on an imam], his father and his father's father before him' (cited in Lisan al-'arab). From the same root comes the word umm or 'mother'. A primary meaning of umm is the flag followed by an army, that which shows the way. The imam of the qawm is also called the umm of the qawm; umm here has the connotations of 'reference', 'way', 'path', 'source', 'identity': in other words, it is the defining tradition that the group takes as its goal and therefore as its source of identification. Hence the word 'mother', the provider of one's identity. That umm is used as a synonym of a source of identification rather than of identity may be surprising.26 It is used abundantly in the Qur'an (e.g. 101. 9) in the sense of 'goal', and as such has an actionalist dimension that is associated therefore with identification rather than passive or received identity. Interestingly, there is no expression in Arabic equivalent to 'procreating': parents are simply the medium for the arrival of the child. One is either 'created' in the passive or given (granted) to one's parents, but not 'procreated'. Thus the biologi cal identity is not literal. This connotation of umm—as source of identification and as a synonym of goal—may be a residue of the matrilineal system that prevailed in early Arab society, when the husband moved in with his wife's tribe among whom the children were raised. Thus it was through the mother (umm) that one identified with a 'tradition' (umma), namely the maternal tribe's ways and cus toms. That is why umm can be used as a synonym of imam. It is clearly used in the sense of 'path', 'tradition', 'way' and 'goal' throughout pre-Islamic and Islamic literature. A saying of the Companions of the Prophet quoted in Lisan al-'arab states: 'If they [the people] obey them (meaning Abu Bakr and 'Umar), they would become righteous and their umm would be straightened.' Linguists have also found the word umm linked with the word wnma or ummetu in other Semitic languages.2 If umm was originally used in the sense of identity (mother as source of identity), it must have 6 'Surprising' relations between words may often reflect the residue of beliefs and practices no longer consciously remembered or understood. An example from Greek: the words nemos and nomos are etymologically related but their meanings ('grove' and 'customs or traditions') are not, and the relationship is not understood until one learns that the sacred territory of the original nomadic tribes that settled in Greece used to be marked by trees. Eventually, nemos loses the meaning of temple and gains that of grove, though it still relates to religion rather than to trees. See F. M. Cornford, From Religion to Philosophy (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1912, repr. 1991), 29 ff. 27 For sources see n. 12 above.</page><page sequence="24">24 MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI shifted to mean a source of identification sometime before the advent of Islam, since umm is used systematically in pre-Islamic literature in the latter sense. Thus it is the root, and not just a single derivative, that underwent a shift in meaning, which leads on to a complex net work of related meanings. All these related concepts point to the same notion—that of umma being a goal, and thus providing a source of identification rather than identity. It is from amma and umm, according to the Arab linguists, that we get imma and umma, both meaning the tradition followed by a group of people and, by extension, the group of people actually following the imam and the tradition that he embodies. Thus, rather than numbers of individuals or ethnic markers such as language or race (that can be expressed by jama'a, qawm, qabila, sba'b—respectively: 'group', 'clan', 'tribe', 'people'), umma refers to that which, transcending the group, is materialized in the tradition, laws, or religion that the group has sought or has voluntarily followed, umma then has to do with identi fication, while qabila or sba'b have to do with the given, or identity. It follows that 'group' or 'people' is not a primary meaning for umma but a derived one: only the group that follows a certain law is an umma, not any group. 'What is sought and followed', i.e. laws and traditions, constitutes the only reference of the umma. Umma can therefore designate a large or small number of people, or indeed an individual. Lisan al-'arab quotes Abfl 'Umar al-Shaybanl as saying: 'umma when it applies to a man who is unlike any other is taken to mean that his seeking is independent and solitary. Thus [al-Nabigha] al-Dhubyanl said: "And could a man who has an umma err if he obeys it."' The meaning of umma in the sense of an individual can be found also in the Prophet's badltb in reference to Zayd b. 'Amr b. Nufayl.28 The cluster of meanings associated with the word umma derive coherently from the root amma. None of them has a direct relation ship to jama'a meaning 'group of people'. Rather, umma has the sense of laws and customs (and hence religion) that is the source of identifi cation. That is why it can be, and is, used in the sense of 'path', and in the Qur'an, 'path' is abundantly used to mean religion and religious tradition. Umma is used of all religious groups. In the Qur'an (43. 22), it is used of the Associationists who, when invited to become Muslims, respond that 'we have found our forefathers on an umma and by their footsteps do we guide ourselves'. The Christian poet al-Nabigha had used it; and it was used by the Prophet to describe the Jews in 28 Ibn Kathir, Al-bidaya wa-l-nihaya (Cairo: Dar al Fikr al 'Arabi, 1982), 239.</page><page sequence="25">qur'Anic concept of identity 2-5 the Constitution of Madina—which means that they probably identi fied themselves as such. On the other hand, the Makkans and the Associationists in general are referred to by the Qur'an as ummiyyun, and the hadith (cited by Lisan al 'arab under the root amma) speaks of the umma of the ummiyyun. Muslim tradition has taken ummJ (pi. ummiyyun) to mean 'illiterate', which is its most widespread meaning in Arabic literature. Current scholarship,29 on the other hand, has ruled that the word means 'unscriptured' or 'scriptureless'. According to the Qur'an (3. 75), the Christians and Jews used the word to designate the Associationists who were ignorant of and did not follow the Christian and Jewish scripture.,IJ In that sense, ummiyyun referred, for the Christians and the Jews, to those outside their traditions, the goyim in a sense, who have no special bond with God. Though the root j-w-' exists in Arabic, the word goyim does not. It is quite possible that ummi was used to express the meaning of goyim.31 The Qur'an reports (3. 75) that the Christians and Jews used it dismissively of the Associationists, claiming that they had no reason to uphold treaties with the ummiyyun. The Qur'an uses the term ironically of the Christian and Jews themselves: 'And some of them are ummiyyun who do not know the Book but rather their own wishful beliefs3 and conjectures' (2. 78). In sum, the ummiyyun are those who ignore the Scripture from within or from outside the traditions of the Jews and Christians. It is in this sense that the Qur'an refers to the Prophet as ummi, sent to these ummiyyun 29 Denny provides a survey of the meanings associated with ummi according to various scholars in 'Meaning of Umma\ 39-42. 30 See the discussion of this usage in Muhammad Shahrur, al-Kitdb wa-l-Qur'an: qird'a mu'asira (Beirut: Sharikat al-Matbu'at li-l-tawz!( wa-l-nashr, 1992), 139. 31 In Qur'anic usage, there are of course none of the theological ramifications of the word goyim as used by the Christians and the Jews, since in Qur'anic philosophy no one stands outside God's reach and all people receive a prophet from God. 32 The word amaniyya here translated as 'wishful beliefs' is defined in Lisan al-'arab as the plural of amniyya, 'lie', from the root m-n-y, to wish. That is because those who 'say' their wishes rather than reality are lying, hence yamnl which means to lie. The contemporary of the Prophet, the poet Ka'b ibn Zuhayr uses it in this sense: fa-md yaghurranka ma mannat wa-ma wa'adat, inna l-amdniyya wa-l-ahlama tadlllu. Guillaume, in J. Kritzeck and R. Winder (eds.), The World of Islam: Studies in Honor of Philip Hitti (New York: St Martin's Press, 1959), clearly errs when he translates the word as 'amens'.

AL FARUQI who are neither Christians nor Jews. If the word meant 'scriptureless', the expression 'ummi Prophet' would be self-contradictory since a prophet is by definition associated with scripture.33 In addition to 3. 75 and 2. 78, 62. 2 refers to the Prophet as an apostle 'from among the ummiyyun and their like (wa-akharlna minhumY, that is the Christians and the Jews who are ummiyyun in the sense identified in 62. 5, as some of 'those who carry the Torah' but are more akin to a beast of burden that carries books it cannot understand. Classical Muslim interpretation of the Qur'an acknowledges the fundamentally religious nature of the word umma. No one, to my knowledge, has ever ascribed to the term the meaning of 'tribe'. However, most also refer to the meaning of jama'a or 'group of people', a term that has no tribal connotations, to explain those usages of umma in the Qur'an that do not expressly identify a bond of faith. Even then, the commentators generally insist on the meaning 'com munity of faith'. Thus, Baydawl34 explicitly maintains that the original meaning of the term is derived from the concept of 'goal' also underlying 'way' and imam. Tabarl35 explains that umma, when used for 'group of people', implies that the people used to be a community of faith. The general consensus, as expressed by Ibn al-jawzl,36 is that umma should be understood as 'community of faith' because that is the most obvious and common use for it in the Qur'an. With regard to the other meanings of umma?7 the commentators usually take j3 Horowitz, in Jewish Proper Names and Derivatives, advocates this meaning. However he assumes that it is a corruption of the Hebrew am ha-ares and on that basis, concludes that it does not therefore apply to the Prophet or the Associationists. But the term is clearly related to its root, amma, and it definitely applies in the Qur'an to the Associationists. The word ummi as 'Gentile' is often understood as 'heathen' and 'pagan' by Western authors who interpret the matter from the perspective of their traditions. That some of those who did not subscribe to these traditions are 'pagans' or, rather, 'Associationists' is just a matter of fact, not of definition. It becomes a negative term when applied to the Christians and Jews themselves in an ironic vein: for the Prophet did not subscribe to these religions, but they did, and in breaking their own traditions they showed themselves to be umml or ignorant of them. 34 See 'Abdullah b. 'Umar Baydawi, Anwar al-tanzil wa-asrar al-ta'wil (Beirut: Dar Sadir, 1974), in loco, 2. 213, 16. 200, 43. 22. 35 Muhammad b.

Tabarl, for example, maintains that umma in the sense of 'a set term' is used because an umma exists within a certain period of time.38 The failure on the part of many commentators to link jama'a and faith is partly due to the fact that the Qur'an uses umma when a proper name for a religious community is not available or not appropriate, with the result that it takes on the coloration of 'group of people'. For example, in the passage in which the children of Israel are faced with the test, which many will fail, of resisting the temptation to drink from a river (2. 249), only a particular 'group of people', not all of the 'children of Israel', are acting. The 'children of Israel' are an umma, but the actions described can be imputed only to some of its members. But often, the umma mentioned by the Qur'an lacks a proper name; hence the Qur'an refers to it simply as an umma, and it is normal, then, that the word would seem synonymous with 'a group of people acting in a certain way', whereas in the example just given, the reference to the followers of a religion by name makes that mistake impossible. This common sense deduction has eluded the commentators because of their exasperating tendency to rely on an atomistic verse-by-verse reading of the Qur'an. Even contemporary analysis falls in that trap. Thus Naslf Nasir, who, like Baydawl and Abu Hayyan al-AndalusI39 makes the assimilation of umma to 'goal' his main thesis, stumbles on the same verses. He solves the problem by assuming that the Qur'an meant umma both in the sense of goal (yielding the concept of a community of faith) and in the sense of origin (yielding the concept of social group), in order to establish a new Muslim community intended, in his view, to transcend and overtake the existing social order described by the second sense. This thesis of historical and social evolution is belied by the fact that the Qur'an refers to historical religious communities as well as present non-Muslim communities (such as the Christians and the Jews) as umam. Nasir's argument is the direct consequence of the failure to see that jama'a is simply a necessary dimension of the word umma.40 38 Tabari, Tafsir, in loco, 7. 34. 39 Muhammad b. Yusuf Abu ayyan, Tuhfat al-'arlb li-ma fi l-Qur'an min al-sharlb (Baghdad: Matba'at alanl, 1977), 36. 0 Naslf Nasir, Mafhum al-umma. Nasir's analysis remains very close to the classical commentators, though his understanding, in one of the meanings he ascribes to the word jama'a, has gone beyond 'group of people' to become assimilated to 'tribe'. Al-Sayyid (al-Umma wa-l-jamd'a) provides a useful and comprehensive survey of all the references to umtna in the classical texts.</page><page sequence="28">28 MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI 2. The Meanings of Umma in the Qur'an A survey of the meanings of umma in the Qur'an shows that the meaning of 'tradition followed by a group of people' is present in all the ways in which it is used.41 1. Utnma in the direct sense of 'path' or 'custom' is already used in the second Makkan period. A group of Associationists invited to Islam respond (43. 22): 'We have found our fathers on an umma and by their footsteps do we guide ourselves.' The relation to 'seeking' is clearer in the next verses, which they are asked if they should not accept a better guidance if it came their way. The construction of the phrase recalls that of al-Nabigha's verse in which people would reach greatness by being 'aid imam, literally 'on a leader', meaning in elliptical Arabic style, being on the path or way embodied by the imam. (This is excellent Arabic and there is no lack of either "logical consistency" or "semantic rigor" in its usage in the Qur'an.42 2. Umma means the group that embodies a certain tradition or way or follows a certain law. In this sense, all of humankind constitute a single umma, being created by God for the purpose of worshipping Him. Any group fulfilling this purpose can be called an umma, hence the use of the word to describe the aggregates of animals and birds and everything referred to in the Qur'an, as 'worshipping' and 'praising' God. Again, umma here has nothing to do with 'tribal aggregates' but derives its meaning from the purpose of the entity—namely to worship God and carry out His will. Humankind constitutes one umma (2. 213 and 10. 19), created to serve the single universal divine will. In reality, as soon as man starts to act, the single umma fractures into those who will follow the moral law and those who will not. Those who believe constitute However, he portrays the Prophet as a revolutionary political reformer (rather than a religious figure). Even so, for both Nasir and al Sayyid (as probably for all Muslims), the Muslim umma is not tribal; rather, it is the product of a new ideology that offers a new social paradigm, actualizing an ideal that transcends the particular groups that existed before its time. 41 It is obviously impracticable to quote here all of the relevant Qur'anic verses. They are: from the second Makkan period—15. 5; 21. 92; 23. 43, 44, 52; 27. 83; 43. 22, 23; third Makkan period—6. 38, 42, 108; 7. 34, 38,159,181; 10. 19, 47, 49; 11. 8, 48, 118; 12. 45; 16. 36, 63, 84, 89, 92, 93, 120; 28. 23, 75; 29. 18; 35. 24, 42; 40. 5; 42. 8; 45. 28; 46. 18; Madinan period—2. 128, 134, 141, 143; 3. 104, 110, 113; 4. 41; 5. 48, 66; 7. 160, 164, 168; 13. 30; 22. 34. 42 Denny's comment on the Qur'anic mastery of Arabic, 'Meaning of umma\ 61.</page><page sequence="29">qur'Anic concept of identity 2-9 a single umma—and that is not restricted to the Muslims: 'This community of yours (O believers) is one single umma and I am your Lord; therefore worship Me [alone]. But men have torn their unity wide asunder [forgetting that] unto Us all are bound to return. And yet whoever does the good deed and is a believer, his endeavour shall not be disowned' (21. 92-4). On the other side, those who disbelieve and share the 'immoral' path are the umma of the unbelievers, which could indeed have comprised the whole of mankind (43. 33). The unity of the people here would result from their universal rejection of God if they had infinite wealth at their disposal. In contradistinction to the umma of the believers, there is the umma of all those who refuse to believe and instead 'associate another will with God's' or 'serve another will than God's' (3. 113; 5. 69; 7. 159, 168, 181). From within all the religious groups, there is an umma that does the good and will be rewarded (2. 134, 141; 3. 104; 45. 28), and another bent on the evil path that will be punished (6. 42; 23. 44). 3. This conceptual umma of all believers (with its counterpart, the umma of all unbelievers) can be seen in the actual groups to which the primordial single umma gave rise, and which can be further identified by the specific creeds into which the primordial message became differentiated. This is a third understanding of umma— the specific religious traditions seen as variant interpretations of the original message (2. 213): All mankind were once one single community; [then they began to differ] whereupon God raised up the prophets as heralds of glad tidings and as warners, and through them bestowed revelation from on high, setting forth the truth, so that it might decide between people with regard to all on which they had come to hold divergent views. Yet none other than the self-same people who had been granted this [revelation] began, out of mutual jealousy, to disagree about its meaning after all evidence of the truth had come unto them. But God guided the believers unto the truth about which, by His leave, they had disagreed: for God guides onto a straight way him that wills [to be guided]. 4. An umma is the religious law and tradition followed and embodied by a group, therefore by extension, the group itself. Thus umma can also refer to the actualized, reified historical entity in time and place: a community that lived by a certain law, had specific rituals or mansak,43 and then withered away (2. 134, 141). 45 The specific path or customs that an umtna follows are also described as tnansak, rites or religious ceremonies. Thus each nmma has its appointed</page><page sequence="30">3° MAYSAM J. AL FARUQ1 5. The umma may comprise many or a few adherents, even no more than one. An individual following God's law perfectly and in stark opposition to all people is an umma on his own. This is a dignity accorded in the Qur'an uniquely to Abraham—the only one from among his qawm that came to the understanding of the divine law and submitted to it. This fifth meaning is also found in the badith where the Prophet uses umma with reference to Zayd b. 'Amr. The individual who has the courage to be totally obedient to God though surrounded by pagans (as Abraham is in 16. 120) becomes a model for humanity, a human and religious exemplar. 6. Umma can mean a tiny group of people devoted to God—a sixth shade of meaning found in 28. 23. Moses meets a small umma watering their flock. At first sight, it looks as if they are a 'clan' or 'tribe', but on closer examination, the usual meaning of umma emerges. In the passage preceding this verse, Moses had asked God to deliver him from the 'unjust' people (the unbelievers pursuing him from Egypt), and in Madyan he stumbles on a small but just community. It is now with the Midianites that he is going to live; he will wander the desert with his new clan, receive revelation on the Mount of Sinai and preach to them (28. 44-5). Hence he is their prophet, and they his umma. A similar problem is found in 7. 160, where the Jewish people are said to have been divided into twelve umam or asbdt (pi. of sibt).44 Sibt as a specific clan or group of people is clear from 2. 60, when Moses strikes the rock bringing forth twelve springs, one for each of the asbdt or tribes. Lisdn al-'arab and Arab linguists in general define sibt as similar to the Arab qablla, but in the sense of being the rite. The parallel with 'path' is evident in, for example, 22. 67: 'to each umma we made a rite which they follow'; and Abraham prays to have God show him 'our rites', how his community is to worship God. These rites change with each revelation, though the reason for their institution is the same: 'and to each umma we have appointed a rite so that they would remember the name of God over the sustenance He gave them from their flocks' (22. 34). In other words, mansak refers to objectified customs and traditions. 44 There is a grammatical difficulty in 7. 160: the Qur'an uses the feminine form of 'twelve'. This would be expected if both terms (asbat and umam) were feminine. However, sibt being masculine, the masculine form of 'twelve' is expected for nouns of mixed gender. Arab and Muslim commentators and grammarians have differed on how to explain this use and run through the whole gamut of possible reasons. Some thought that 'twelve' qualifies only umam and not asbat. Others maintained that sibt could be either feminine or masculine. Still others considered that sibt is being used as a predicate, and that one should understand the phrase as firqata asbdta, where the feminine firqa would then</page><page sequence="31">qur'anic concept of identity 31 progeny of a single, close ancestor—in other words more akin to clan. But in 4. 163 the asbat are expressly mentioned in the string of recipients of divine revelations: 'We inspired Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, the asbat, Jesus, Job...In the Qur'an, the word sibt is used only in connection with the twelve tribes of Israel; it is not used in the sense of qawm, nor does it apply to other people. It could therefore be that these asbat are umam in that each is given a distinct religious calling. Strengthening this possibility is the fact that the word sibt is used in the sense of umma in the hadlth in which the Prophet calls his grandson, al-Husayn, 'a sibt among the asbaf, in the same way that he called Zayd an umma (cf. Lisan al-'arab, under s-b-t). 7. Alternatively, umma can refer to a large group of people, as in 16. 92-3: do not use your oaths as a means of deceiving one another, simply because some of you may be [a larger umma] more powerful than others. By all this, God but puts you to a test—and [He does it] so that on Resurrection Day He might make clear to you all that on which you were wont to differ. For, had God so willed, He could surely have made you all one single [umma] community... In other words, the Muslims are asked not to make false or vain oaths on the strength of their numbers. 8. Just as those who follow and embody the umma are by extension identified as the umma, the word can take on the connotation of the time or life-span of the community. This eighth shade of meaning has a near equivalent in the English 'generation', which can mean the period of time and the people of that period. In the Qur'an (11. 8) the judgement of a community is delayed till a time that is also the end of its lifespan: 'And thus it is: if We defer their suffering to an umma, they are sure to say: "What is preventing it [from coming now]?"' 9. Each umma has an appointed term, which cannot be changed (e.g. 10. 49, 15. 5, 23. 43). The concept of 'time' is integral to that of require the feminine form of 'twelve'. Lastly, al-Jawharl correctly pointed out that normally, after a number above ten, the singular form of the noun is used not the plural as in umam and asbat. Therefore, he concludes, the words asbat and umam are appositional qualifiers of 'twelve', making 'twelve' the qualified (rather than qualifying) term. His explanation is the most logical, grammatically speaking, and would imply that asbat is either synonymous with umam or that umam is used to qualify asbat. In the latter case, it would be enhancing the meaning of asbat. Since umma is more general than sibt, umma would then be expanding its meaning to indicate the universal paradigm behind the specific rite.</page><page sequence="32">32 MAYSAM J. AL FARUQI umma in the sense of its 'age' or 'life', which is always as long as 'one's existence'—i.e. quite long. In 12. 45 it is used in the sense of what feels like a lifetime to Joseph, languishing in an Egyptian jail until a freed fellow prisoner remembered to speak on his behalf: 'At that, the one of the two [erstwhile prisoners] who had been saved, and [who suddenly] remembered Joseph after all that time (umma), spoke thus: "It is I who can inform you of the real meaning of this [dream]; so let me go [in search of it]".' 10. The meaning of umma wasat, or the ideal umma, is the one that matters most to Muslim theology and identity. In that humankind were created for a single purpose, they are a single umma. How they act will determine the actual umma in history. The ideal is when the umma in act coincides with the potential umma. The ideal umma is the umma of all believers, who come from the various historical umam. They are the ones who, since they stood for the moral law, can witness against their own people. Hence the affirmation that from each umma on the Day of Judgement a witness will be drawn (e.g. 4. 41, 28. 75), normally the prophet himself that was sent to them. Similarly, in inter-umma relations, the righteous umma (which must be a metacommunity since there can be evildoers in every umma including the Muslim one)45 will be called to witness against other umam on their collective transgressions, for which they will be punished as a collectivity (e.g. 7. 38, 45. 28). This ideal umma is called an umma wasat, a 'middle' community, in that it follows the golden mean, not straying into the extremes for which man has a natural penchant.46 The 'middle' umma is not defined as a physical entity, though of course it becomes one when all those who are righteous are counted in. The Qur'an (49. 14-15) differentiates between the Muslims who take their religion only as identity and those who actually believe and act In Qur'an 47. 38 and 9. 38, this reified and objectified Muslim nmnia (said to have submitted but not believed) is threatened with obliteration if it does not believe in and uphold the moral law. However, the single umma that ought to be associated with the Qur'an as a final, universal divine message gave the commentators some pause, facing as they did a religiously fractured world. The problem was resolved by considering that the world community was indeed the umma of the Prophet, but made of two segments: one that already confessed belief (the Muslims) and was responsible for preaching the faith, and the other that would become Muslim eventually, if the preaching was persuasive. 46 See Fazlur Rahman's discussion of this theme in Major Themes of the Qur'an, 17 ff.</page><page sequence="33">qur'Anic concept of IDENTITY 33 on it: 'Say you submitted but did not believe'. The verse is addressing the Bedouins who agree to take on the new reference as if it were only an identity similar to 'one's ancestor's faith' rather than a conscious act of identification as required by the concept of umma. That is why it is from among all the Muslims (and beyond them, from all of humankind) that the Qur'an calls for the umma ivasat to arise: 'Let there arise out of you an umma that invites to the good, that enjoins what is right and forbids what is wrong; those are the felicitous' (3. 104, emphasis added). It is a meta-community constantly in the making but clearly defined, which is why the Qur'an uses a verb form (equi valent to a subjunctive here) that covers past and future: 'You would be (kuntum) the best umma evolved for mankind, enjoining the good, prohibiting evil and believing in God' (3. 110), to whom, as the verse continues, most of the followers of earlier revelations would have belonged 'had they believed (and indeed some do believe) [and] that would have been for their own good'. This ideal umma exists then through and in every righteous individual. It is made in the flesh and blood of all those who submit to the divine law. Inasmuch as it includes past, present and future members embodying the law, it is the meta-historical ideal community closest to the path prescribed by God, an ideal community always to be realized, in which every individual equally applies the divine law fully and with full consent of his or her own will, thus becoming, like Abraham, an umma on his or her own. Conclusion The building block of Muslim collective identity is a religious con cept and a source of identification rather than a source of identity. It is defined neither racially nor ethnically. It is not political in nature: rather its definition is firmly rooted in religion. The Muslims see their community as a religious community, requiring adherence to religious beliefs and laws rather than to political structures. One could have an umma, made of a small group of people on an isolated island, without any formal state structure. However, if a state is to be developed, the religious identification will play a defining role in that its mandate must be respected—namely, to provide the Muslims with the proper environment in which to live according to the faith, and in which the rights guaranteed by the faith are upheld. There is no specifically political identity assumed or provided for in the Qur'anic umma.
