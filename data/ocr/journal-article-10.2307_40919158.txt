<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOW AND ABSENCE IN THE EARLY EKELÖF ArisFioretos Yale University EkelöF'S POEM "osynlig närvaro" ("invisible presence"), first published as the fourth entry in sent pã jorden (1932; late on earth), bears upon questions of poetic articulation (Dikter 16-17). As such, it must be understood to express concerns that generate the texts of Ekelöf's debut collection in general. Demonstrating a paradoxical relationship be- tween visibility and invisibility, the poem conveys a disturbingly im- penetrable presence. The lack of a substantial core in this presence, intimated by the title and recurring in other late on earth poems, permits a rotating motion of polarities, such as those of sight and sound, interior and exterior, presence and absence. The vacillating between these polarities will be the concern of this paper. The poem reads: gryningen kom med brüsten blick, fönstret stirrade länge i ögonblicket som foli bort dâ väckarklockan ringde . . . en gäspning släpade sig över golvet och drunknade i lavoaren, vinden öppnade badrumsfönstret, gardinen dansade pâ tvären . . . därute drack vattendropparna ljus i dimman som speglade gatuförsäljarnas osynliga rop och de stora svaria trädena liknade ljudlösa rop med armarna i lüften . . . [Paris 29] Frederic Fleisher, thus far the only English translator of the poem, renders it in the following way (Ekelöf, Eight Sw. Poets 14): dawn came with a shattered gaze, the window stared at length Scandinavian Studies 62(1990): 319-30</page><page sequence="2">320 Scandinavian Studies at the moment that fell away when the alarm clock rang . . . a yawn dragged itself across the floor and drowned in the washstand, the wind opened the bathroom window, the curtain danced sideways . . . outside the water-drops drank light in the mist that mirrored the invisible cries of the street peddlers and the large black trees resembled soundless cries with their arms in the air ... The semantics of Ekelöf s text refuse any easy crystallization into understanding. As has been well documented in Ekelöf scholarship, this refusal was one of the capital reasons for the abundant criticism his debut received at the dawn of Swedish modernism.1 The way of writing poetry revealed by late on earth was seen to upset the usually unquestioned rules governing the transmission of belief, emotion, and perception from text to reader, hitherto taken for granted by an audience raised on Mascoll Silfverstolpe or the young Gullberg.2 Georg Svensson's pejorative com- ments on the incomprehensibility of Ekelöf s "uttrycksform" ("form of expression"), is instructive in this respect, since it was precisely Ekelöf s reluctance to administrate his poetic practice in accordance with estab- lished usage of poetic discourse that caused the irritation. Svensson calls it a "förödelse" ("disaster") in his review in Bonnier s litter ära magasin, adding that, . . . naturligtvis kan det ligga nâgot patetiskt och fantasieggande over ett skönt fragment, som slitits ur sitt sammanhang, men att basera en hel uttrycksform pâ desorganisation och intellektuell och emotioneil viljelöshet är esteticism av osundaste sort [75]. (. . . in a beautiful fragment torn from its context, there may of course be something pathetic and stimulating to the imagina- tion, but to found a whole form of expression on disorganization and intellectual and emotional lack of will is an aestheticism of the most unhealthy kind.) Falling back on cumbersome value criteria such as hygiene or health, Svensson's opinion about late on earth is indeed supremely deaf to the importance of Ekelöf s early work. It may nevertheless be worth tracing some of these aspects of Ekelöf s disastrous "form of expression" as they occur in "invisible presence," in order to read the way in which the poem performs its disorganization of traditional poetry in favor of a different</page><page sequence="3">Early Ekelöf 321 manner of articulation. This articulation may indicate the originality of Ekelöf s writing in the early thirties, as well as the poetical novelties that forced its readers to trail behind. **** The poem displays a number of stylistic features we know from Ekelöf s inventory of poetic techniques at the time. Some already docu- mented observations on the style in late on earth may also characterize "invisible presence" and point to its exemplarity. The poem reveals an attenuating abstraction and an attempt "att applicera ett s. k. non-figurativt bildseende [Moberg 15]" ("to apply a so-called nonfigurative imagina- tion"); one also notices "de syntaktiska och grammatiska destruktionerna [Landgren, Den poetiska världen 99]" ("the syntactical and grammatical destructions") characteristic of Ekelöf s poetry at the time, and a "reducer- ing av den poetiska Vokabularen [Olsson 65]" ("reduction of poetic vocabulary"); lastly, the "utstrykande av all subjektivitet och erfarenhet [Olsson 65]" ("erasure of all subjectivity and experience"), and "tanken pâ döden i li vet, likgiltigheten [och] tröttheten [Landgren, Ensamheten 65]" ("the thought of death in life, the apathy [and] the fatigue") can be singled out as typical features. Indeed, the "radikalt normbrytande och brutalt provokativa draget" ("radically norm-breaking and brutally provocative feature"), to use Bengt Landgren' s description {Den poetiska världen 98) of late on earth, bears that Mallarméan imprint we have learned to expect from the author of En natt vid horisonten? The language of the poem appears as a self-sufficient entity, positing an anonymous world where the enigmatically bleak reality is meticulously deprived of expressions of subjective intent. The impersonal tonality not only gives voice to a fragmented and mechanical set of events but also performs a withdrawal from the realm of sensory perception that inversely, ex negativo, introduces a positive element in that very void it leaves behind by privileging the intrinsic attributes of language. The text that asserts the erasure of the I or self is not affected by this deprivation, however, since it must be thought of as the nucleus that engenders the assertion. It may seem, therefore, as if the rhetoric of "invisible presence" promotes a paradoxical presence in the very absence of thematically anchored subjectivity. The poem performs a verbal furnishing of Mallarmé' s Nothing or Absence, though sparsely. The hollow markers of this furnishing - a "yawn" and an open "bathroom window," mirrored "invisible cries" and "black trees" "with their arms in the air" - are inscribed in the text through a rhetorical figuration that includes the repetition of aposiopeses at the end of each stanza and, more importantly, anthropomorphisms and a</page><page sequence="4">322 Scandinavian Studies catachresis. Thus the invisibility thematized by the text is made present through rhetorical devices that fill out the vacuum surrounding a con- sciousness devoid of activity and participation. By disorganizing the usual perception of the physical world, the poem by the same token establishes an autonomous poetic reality from which conventional comprehension is excluded. This is a movement that can be seen to recur throughout the poems of Ekelöf s debut, though it may require a certain misapprehension to view it with that feeling one has, according to Svensson, "när man ser ett vackert föremal, som tappats i gol vet och slagits i tusen spillror [75]" ("when one sees a beautiful object dropped on the floor and shattered into a thousand pieces"). In fact, if the dismembered parts of Ekelöf s poetic world are governed by a unifying principle - but that may be doubted - this precept may well reside in the homology of the rhetorical structure of each individual text, rather than in the grammatical or descrip- tive consolidation of their arrangement. Readings not aware of this pos- sibility are bound to repeat Svensson' s essentially aestheticizing evaluation, based as it is on unquestioned notions of the poetic text as an organic whole, harmonious and excelling in euphonic beauty. In "invisible presence," a principle of equality distributes an equal portion of thematic dignity to each perceptual fragment, image, and stanza. This equalization occurs through a series of short sequences that more often than not consist in nominal phrases. Throughout the poem, the temporal mode is phrased in the preterit: "came," "stared," "rang," "dragged," "drowned," "drank," and so forth - a catalogue of verbs that, in its repetitive unfolding of a temporality that is precisely not present, underscores a disorganization of conventional reality through which the imaginary world of the poem, in its turn, gains in corresponding actuality. The independent thematic sequences of the text, nearly synonymous with the three stanzas of the poem, depict a room at dawn. A gradual centering takes place, from the approaching morning to a considerably more narrow perspective - to a punctum, in fact, being the very moment when the sudden ringing of the alarm clock punctuates the poem, and sets its narrative chronology in motion. This ringing moment initiates a curious activity: a yawn drags "itself across the floor" and drowns "in the washstand." Near the washstand, the wind opens a bathroom window, and - passing by way of the poetically rewarding transit of an aposiopesis - we are once again introduced to the early morning, the bleak light penetrating the mist, the street peddlers, and the black trees that resemble "soundless cries with their arms in the air." The break with normal rules of perception in "invisible presence" corresponds to a privileging of deliberately fragmented iconic qualities. Ekelöf s contact with contemporary nonfigurative painting - predominant-</page><page sequence="5">Early Ekelöf 323 ly various forms of post-Cubism, such as Art concret and Purism - has rightly been stressed by several scholars, including Ulf Thomas Moberg and Anders Olsson.4 In the case of "invisible presence," it is evident that its Mallarméan diction is permeated by a manner of elocution whose technique is imported from that kind of painting.5 The poem reveals an attempt to capture objects or emotions through a dense diversity of perspec- tives, thus reflecting and transforming an inherent multi-dimensionality in a way that does linguistic justice to its motif. On the typographical level, for example, one finds a consistent use of small letters, recurring throughout late on earth, that accentuates an uninterrupted linking together of seemingly arbitrary events. On the lexical level, words are usually excerpted from the vocabulary of a "denaturerad prosa" ("denaturated prose"), to use a term provided by the title of another poem in the collection. At the level of syntax, the sequentiality is underscored by a paratactic omission of conjunctions condensing the poetic texture. As for sonority, the use of alliterations and assonances further emphasizes the very absence created by the poem. In addition, finally, various expressions that recur in the text endow the inarticulate with an onomatopoetically twisted articulation: the ¿f-sound of "gäspningen släpade sig" in the second stanza, for example, or the 0-sound of "osynliga rop" in the third. The poem is one of the few Ekelöf commented on himself ("osynlig närvaro" 33-36). Yet Ekelöf s considerations in the autobiographical mar- gin of his text seem to trouble the reading of it in a particularly instructive manner. Under the vignette "Diktaren om dikten" ("The Poet on the Poem"), the title of a series of essay istic reflections first published in the periodical Samtid och framtid (4 [1951]), Ekelöf commented on two poems from his first volume. One of them is "invisible presence." The scenario of the text, he then tells us, är square de Châtillon, Paris, i fjortonde arrondissementet dar jag en tid bebodde en liten vâning. Stämningen är dagen efter. I "ögonblicket som foli bort" torde den för lasaren osynlige lägenhetsinnehavaren ha begrundat vad det var han inte kom ihâg. . . . [F]ramför allt minns jag en tiggare, en osynlig närvaro eftersom jag pâ grund av stängda persienner aldrig sett, bara hört honom. . . . Men dikten är ocksâ nâgonting annat. Kubismen hade denna tid (20-talet) ingâtt i en fridsammare och pâ satt och vis "lycklig" period. Det var framför allt Picasso och Braque som inaugurerade fönsterbilden med det karakteristiska järngallret. Detta är ett försök i ord till en sâdan bild:</page><page sequence="6">324 Scandinavian Studies fönsterdöbattanger öppna, gardin, spjäljalusiner, träd därute och i förgrunden en i olika attityder komponerad "närvaro."6 (is the Square de Châtillon, Paris, in the fourteenth arrondisse- ment, where for a time I occupied a small flat. The mood is the morning after. In "the moment that fell away," the inhabitant of the flat, invisible to the reader, should have established what it was he did not remember. . . . [F]irst of all I remember the beggar, an invisible presence, since I, owing to closed blinds, never saw him, only heard him. . . . But the poem is also something else. At this time [the 1920s], Cubism had entered a more peaceful, in some ways "happier" period. It was primarily Picasso and Braque who inaugurated the window image, with the characteristic iron grille. This is an attempt in words at such a picture: shutters open, curtain, Venetian blind, trees beyond, and in the foreground a "presence" composed in various at- titudes.) Ekelöf stayed in Paris from the end of September 1929 to June 1930. He originally planned to study music. In a fictional letter to a friend, written some five years later and printed in the fragmentary attempt at an autobiography, En självbiografi (1971), the Parisian stay is discussed (88-91). While cautioning that "[m]innet bedrar" ("[m]emory betrays"), Ekelöf writes: Forst minns jag den ofantliga, ohyggliga ensamheten. . . . I det ena rummet var fönsterluckorna alltid stängda. . . . [E]nsamheten . . . spann sina spindeltrâdar over fönstren och slog sin klo i min själ. Pâ bordet lâg en anteckningsbok öppen. Dar skrev jag en tanke dâ och dâ. . . . Det avlövade trädet utanför mitt fönster künde inte växa mer övergivet och mer undergivet an jag själv. . . . Ibland kom en gatusângare in i den lilla gränden och ställde sig dar för att sjunga. Klagande gammalmansröster, slitna och färglösa som det mulna ljuset en höstdag. oändligt lângsamma, släpande melodier och tiggande tonfali. Gatuförsäljarnas rop trängde ocksâ in dit, men man künde aldrig höra vad det var de salde, det lät bara som spridda lockrop utan nâgon mening. . . . För övrigt nâdde mig bullret av vârlden utanför endast som obestämda ljud man hör i sömnen [88-89]. (First I remember the immense and frightful loneliness. ... In one of the rooms, the window shutters were always closed. . . . [T]he loneliness [spun] its spider web over the windows and [dug] its claw into my soul. On the table, a notebook lay open.</page><page sequence="7">Early Ekelöf 325 Now and then I wrote down a thought in it. ... The defoliated tree outside my window could not grow more abandoned and more resigned than I myself. . . . Sometimes a street singer came into the small alley and stood there to sing. Complaining old-mens' voices, worn and colorless as the clouded light on a fall day, infinitely slow, dragging melodies and begging tones. The cries of the street peddlers also intruded, but one could never hear what it was they were selling; it sounded only like dispersed cries without any meaning. . . . Besides that, the noise of the world outside reached me only as the undefined sounds one hears in sleep.) The setting is familiar: an interior, invaded by ennui and voided of affirmative action, is juxtaposed with an exterior, a noisily intrusive apparition, but one deprived of the signification that usually goes along with sound. The "dispersed cries without meaning," mentioned in this autobiographical account and belonging to the realm of exteriority, only reach the passive subject "as the undefined sounds one hears in sleep." This perforation of the bar that separates inner actuality from outer reality, silence from sonority, consciousness from corporeality, is paralleled in Ekelöf s late account by the intrusion of undetermined sound into sleeping. Impossible to block out and yet bereft of any meaning, the vacillating of such an intrusion is the principle governing the rotating motion of polarities in "invisible presence." The image of the window, borrowed from Cubist paintings, establishes the vacillation and may be read as its emblem. Ekelöf s fictive letter suggests one way of interpreting the title of the poem. It proffers the street singer outside the window, but invisible to the inhabitant of the flat and singing "infinitely slow, dragging melodies and begging tones." The interpretation in Samtid och framtid, on the other hand, leaves the matter more open. There, Ekelöf speaks about remembering the beggar - an "invisible presence," as he puts it - but also mentions the "inhabitant of the flat, invisible to the reader," who "'in the moment that fell away' . . . should have established what it was he did not remember." This may be worth noticing, since the former char- acter - the beggar, or the street singer singing "begging tones" - belongs to the realm of exteriority, whereas the latter - the inhabitant of the flat - is part of the interior world. Ekelöf himself, reminiscent of the situation and yet warning that "[m]emory betrays," thus prolongs the question of the invisible presence, rather than puts it to rest. The strange and impenetrable presence of which the poem speaks indeed cannot be seen. It may even seem undecidable, given the mutually</page><page sequence="8">326 Scandinavian Studies exclusive suggestions proffered by Ekelöf s two accounts. The presence is devoid of that materiality which would make its identity ascertainable. One commentator, Rabbe Enckell, noticing the general lack of subjectivity in late on earth, writes that, . . . jaget förlorar sin naturgivna kapacitet till självidentitet och man vantar detonationen efter en självsprängning i det själsliga landskapets förtunnade atmosfär. [24] (. . . the I loses its naturally inherent capacity for self-identity, and one awaits the detonation after a self-explosion in the at- tenuating atmosphere of the spiritual landscape.) The observation is cogent, though not free from apocalyptic inclina- tion. The spiritual setting of Ekelöf s poem surely harbors a reified world where objects do not disclose any order that is graspable or, for that matter, possible to utter in harmony with preestablished categories of meaning. "Korrespondensen mellan jaget och sinne världen är störd" ("The correspondence between the self and the material world is disturbed"), Enckell rightly infers (25). There may be perception in Ekelöf s poem, visual as well as auditive, but what is perceived seems deprived of further signification. The text weaves the pattern of a perceptual disturbance. The record of this perception, though no longer interpretable according to traditional doctrines of poetic validity, is eminently textual, thus still readable. In the poem, it may therefore be worth paying attention to the way in which the text performs that absence of perceptual normality which it in fact is about. **** "[OJsynlig närvaro" opens in medias res. A dawn comes with a shattered gaze. This anthropomorphism allows for a reversal of attributes, yet it likewise assumes - in the words of Paul de Man - "an identification on the level of substance" (241). The spiritless morning hour of "invisible presence" is animated, in other words, and given sight. The giving of vision, however, does not stop at this. It continues in "the window [that] stared," and is thereafter temporalized: the window stared "at length," the text has it, "at the moment that fell away." The original has ögonblick, "moment" or "blink," which is an idiomatically economic coagulation of time and momentary sight, temporality and vision. After this curious opening, follows a yawn that drags itself across the floor and drowns in the washstand. The synecdoche here - standing in for a tired subject who is denied more qualified presence - is then left in the bathroom, while the narrative of the poem takes us out through the window, to the trees</page><page sequence="9">Early Ekelöf 327 and the soundless cries. These latter anthropomorphisms - "water-drops" that drink light and "large black trees" with arms - may be read as attempts at figuratively manifesting a presence that cannot be seen. The setting pictured in the poem is spelled out mainly through this confusion of essentially different realms of existence: on the one hand, the realm of objects, deprived of soul and intention; on the other, the realm of consciousness, burdened by languid desolation. Anthropomor- phism is the principal conceit of this confusion, by which human properties are projected into the natural world. By taking the natural world as human, it simultaneously takes the human as something already given (cf. de Man 241). This entwinement of different orders of being thus implies creating a naturalness of man - which, in its turn, suggests that man and nature vanish as categories, as their difference from each other is eliminated. Ekelöf s text demonstrates such an elimination of the dis- tinction between the order of man and the order of nature, between consciousness and reality, and the image of the window may be read as the emblem of its possibility, since it is that phenomenon - establishing the interior and exterior worlds of the poem - which permits Ekelöf to turn normal perception inside out. But if anthropomorphism still allows us to identify something on the level of substance, there is another, more violent figure in Ekelöf s poem that radicalizes the perceptual ambiguities put forth by the text. In Ekelöf s 1951 interpretation of "invisible presence," he largely characterized the method by which elimination is brought into poetic play, when he stated that the poem was "an attempt in words at such a picture [i.e., a Cubist "window image"]: shutters open, curtain, Venetian blind, trees beyond and in the foreground a 'presence' composed in various attitudes." The mention of Venetian blinds makes it easier to picture the morning light that arrives with a "shattered gaze." The curtain that dances "sideways" underscores this arrival, as do the drops of water that prismatically reflect the light they drink in the mist, with the invisible cries from the street peddlers contained therein. The physical world here comes to speak through a transaction of human properties, which then grants natural elements the poetic license of assuming perception and articulation. The window renders possible the exchange between interior and exterior. This essentially rhetorical movement indicates, in the text, the proximity of anthropomorphism to another and more disruptive figure of speech, catachresis - that arbitrary imposition of trope which gives name to a yet unnamed entity by the "misuse" of figurai speech. Catachresis is the misapplication of a word that gives face to the face- less - "the eye of a hurricane," say, or "the leg of a chair" - as is the case with the very moment at which the "dawn came" and "the window</page><page sequence="10">328 Scandinavian Studies stared." This "moment" is an ögonblick, which is a misuse of figurai speech, since it gives face and sight to an entity that most certainly has neither. Through the peculiar twists of the Swedish idiom, temporality is here given eyes to see - even if only for a short while. Prior to any perception, this is the catachrestic moment that inaugurates Ekelöf's poem, marking the instant that initiates the text's process of signification. What makes this more than a random occurrence of trope, however, is that the vision of the catachresis is conferred at the very instant that the text shifts from the figuration of visibility to audibility, "at the moment that fell away / when the alarm clock rang." The rhetorical movement by which the moment of the arriving dawn is made visible occurs at the same instant as the language of the poem speaks of the power of sound. Thus the literal report of this transition - also marked syntactically, by the temporal conjunction "when" in the fourth line - is not so much a denomination of property as the indication of a rhetorical movement. The catachresis of ögonblick coincides, simultaneously, with the ringing of the alarm clock. Hence it grounds an invisibility, since sound cannot be seen, as the poem rightly points out later, mentioning the "invisible cries" from outside. This is an invisibility that is nonetheless made present - all the more so, inasmuch as sound can be seen to be a feature of language that is necessarily immanent to it. Rather than being the passive reflection of a very empty reality, Ekelöf's poem reveals a conception of language as act, as a making- present. Reading - a reading devoted to the figurative fragmentation dis- played by Ekelöf's early poetry - is the only practice in which such a movement may become present. The "presence" of "invisible presence" is therefore not so much an a priori presence as it is "made" present through catachresis. This difference generates the conflict between per- ception and trope articulated by Ekelöf's poem. It is the initial imposition of catachresis that renders possible the poetic process of comparison and identification, organized in various figurative patterns with anthropomor- phism as dominating trope. The moment in which "invisible presence" inaugurates its presence, however, is said to be a moment "that fell away." What the text thus actually makes present can preside only in absentia. As in the case of Mallarméan poetics, figurai language fills out a voided center, allowing it to circulate linguistically by being phenomenalized as time and ringing, temporality and sound, the two inherent features of speech. The text engenders a presence bound to be invisible. It is a presence that can occur only in that Now which always, necessarily, coincides with the act of reading. Yet the poem tells us that this Now is a moment that simultaneously falls away, thereby depriving</page><page sequence="11">Early Ekelöf 329 us of the scene of action that Svensson apostrophized, derogatorily speak- ing about an "intellectual and emotional lack of will" in late on earth. This lack - which now turns out to be rigorously linguistic, but hardly aesthetic - is what Ekelöf s text renders present. The invisibility must occur by a process of signification, a process that reading only unravels. Nothing substantial remains after its having taken place, however, so there may be a sort of "disaster." Yet in that case, it is a "disaster" proper to all language. That this seems to be what Ekelöf s poem speaks about only under- scores the acuity of his debut collection and the understandable momentum it formulated at the dawn of Swedish modernism. From the reader's or critic's view point (pace Svensson), it may be comforting, though decided- ly more unsettling, that Ekelöf s poem thereby also points to that other disaster Novalis touched upon when stating that it would be "Unglück, wenn die Poesie auf die Theorie wartete" (625). This paper was conceived as a contribution to a panel on "Swedish Poetry" at the 78th Annual Conference of Scandinavian Study at the University of Oregon at Eugene, April 28-30, 1988. It originates in a different discussion of Ekelöf that appeared in Tidskrift for Litteraturvetenskap 11.2 (1982): 111-19, under the title "Spridd närvaro." I would prefer not to assume responsibility for this earlier discussion. 1 In general I agree with the assumptions and observations put forth by Bengt Landgren (Ensamheten; Denpoetiska världen), Anders Olsson, and Conradin Perner, the three scholars who have done the most to refine our understanding of the early Ekelöf. Only Landgren {Den poetiska världen), however, devotes more than passing attention to the rhetoric of Ekelöf s poems, and then he does so from a perspective that could be further elaborated, especially with regard to the problematic interplay of theme and figure in the texts. "Invisible presence" - only casually discussed by these scholars, when discussed at all - poses problems of this order in an exemplary fashion. 2 Landgren has sketched the broader strokes of the reception at the time (Den poetiska världen 13-43). 3 Written at the same time, but not published until the réédition of late on earth in 1962, to which it served as appendix. Ekelöf s relation to Mallarmé is the topic of Perner' s dissertation Gunnar Eke löfs Nacht am Horizont. It has been discussed most recently by Olsson (esp. 62-97). 4 See also Landgren's useful, if preliminary, essay "Ekelöf, purismen och art concret." 5 This supposition can loosely be supported by the dating of the poem: "Paris 29." 6 Ekelöf, "osynlig närvaro" 35-36. The version of the poem that was published in conjunction with Ekelöf s article differs in some respects from the version to be found in late on earth. Apart from the modernization of a plural-ending ("trädena" becomes "träden"), alterations are done in order to distribute the center of gravity in the text. Three commas have been omitted, as well as a definite article and the accompanying date.</page><page sequence="12">330 Scandinavian Studies WORKS CITED Ekelöf, Gunnar.
