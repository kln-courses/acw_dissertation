As artists and others produce live art on the Internet, liveness, presence, mediatization, on-line activism, surveillance and identity/gender, among other issues, are being explored. Guest Editor Martha Wilson investigates the subject of "Live Art and Science on the Internet" in this ongoing special section in Leonardo, looking at the work of artists and scientists using the Internet to create work or conduct investigations live and on-line.</page><page sequence="7">CALL FOR PAPERS Nanotechnology, Nanoscale Science and Art Leonardo Special Section Guest Editors: Tom Rockwell and Tami I. Spector Over the last decade, "nano" has become the buzzword signifying everything from imagined atomic-scale robotic utopias to small electronics. For scientists the shift toward nano has also become ubiquitous; what used to be referred to as "molecular" has been reframed as "nano," 27 journals devoted to nanotech/ nanoscience are now published, and the National Science Foundation and other granting agencies have devoted a significant amount of funding toward nanotech/nanoscience. Among engineers, scientists and science-studies scholars, discussions of the potential of nanotech/nanoscience abound, including confer ences that debate the pros and cons of a nano-hegemony and attempt to debunk some of the hype. Artists, however, have only begun to explore this emergent scientific field, leaving it wide open for creative inter pretation. With this special section of Leonardo we hope to ignite artists' interest in the exploration of nan otech/nanoscience and encourage scientists, scholars and educators to contemplate the implications of an art-nanotech/nanoscience connection. Leonardo, in collaboration with the Exploratorium under the auspices of the Nanotech Informal Science Education Network, will publish a series of special sections periodically over the next 5 years exploring the intersections of nanotech/nanoscience and art. We are especially seeking submissions of artworks (visual, performance, sound, etc.) with artists' statements explaining the relationship of the work to nanotech/ nanoscience; essays from scientists, engineers and scholars exploring the connection between nanotech/ nanoscience and art; and essays and visuals aiming at nanotech/nanoscience education that uses the arts as a pedagogical tool. Interested artists and authors are invited to send proposals, queries and/or manuscripts to the Leonardo editorial office: Leonardo, 800 Chestnut St., San Francisco, CA 94133, TJ.S.A.

Performance in the Age of Digital Reproduction Downloads and file exchanges have altered the economics of music of consumption, but have they also rendered the concert hall obsolete? Or have the isolation of ear buds and the ephemerality of digital files actually served to highlight the social significance and sweaty substantiality of live performance? Or are we witnessing the birth of a new "live," virtually social but vitally sweat-free?

In this issue, we present an article from the first issue of Leonardo, published in 1967: FrankJ. Malina's "Kinetic Painting: The Lumidyne System." The reader is invited to read and marvel at the groundbreaking work and thought of this artist documented in Leonardo 40 years ago.</page><page sequence="12">Happy 40th Birthday, Leonardo! Forty years ago in Paris, a group of artists, scientists and engineers got together and decried the lack of professional venues where emerging work bridging the two cultures could be presented, debated and pro moted. Frank Malina, himself a research engineer and a professional artist, convinced publisher Robert Maxwell of Pergamon Press to take on the challenge of publishing a peer-reviewed scholarly art-science technology journal, the first time such a project had been attempted. Thus was the journal Leonardo born. In celebration of Leonardos 40th birthday, we will be organizing and co-sponsoring a number of events and projects as one way to bring artists, scientists, engineers and scholars into creative friction, face to face, on-line and through publication and dialogue: Leonardo Celebrates Leonardo da Vinci Special Section of Leonardo, 2007-2008, edited by David Carrier What, building upon Leonardo's ways of thinking, can artists and scientists tell each other today?

Marks, Anna Munster, Michael Punt, Sundar Sarukkai, Eugene Thacker Editorial Consultant: Joel Slayton The arts, sciences and technology are experiencing a period of profound change. Explosive challenges to the institutions and practices of engineering, art-making and scientific research raise urgent questions of ethics, craft and care for the planet and its inhabitants. Unforeseen forms of beauty and understanding are possible, but so too are unexpected risks and threats. A newly global connectivity creates new arenas for interaction between science, art and technology, but also creates the preconditions for global crises. The Leonardo Book Series, published by The MIT Press, aims to consider these opportunities, changes and challenges in books that are both timely and of enduring value. Leonardo Books provide a public forum for research and debate; they contribute to the archive of art science-technology interactions; they contribute to understandings of emergent historical processes; and they point toward future practices in creativity, research, scholarship and enterprise. Proposals that address these challenges in terms of theory, research and practice, education, historical scholarship, discipline summaries and experimental texts will be considered. Single-authored books are particularly encouraged. When submitting a proposal, bear in mind that we need to know as much as possible about the scope of your book, its intended audience and how best to bring the book to the attention ofthat audience. We need to be convinced that the material is important and that you can communicate clearly and precisely in ways your audience will appreciate. Proposals should include (1) a prospectus describing the book, (2) a detailed table of contents, (3) two to four sample chapters, and (4) an up-to-date r?sum?/curriculum vitae for the author. Full submission guidelines: &lt;leonardo.info/isast/leobooks/guidelines.html&gt;. Inquiries and proposals should be submitted to both: Leonardo Book Series c/o Leonardo 800 Chestnut Street San Francisco, CA 94133 U.S.A. and Doug Sery MIT Press Books 55 Hayward Street Cambridge, MA 02142 U.S.A.
