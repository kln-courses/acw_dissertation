<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION' HARVEY PINNEY S OCIAL science has suffered from certain major deficien- cies. Chief among them has been the lack of a general systematic theory by which to comprehend the gen- erality of social facts and through which some intelligible divi- sion of the field could be made-a division the separate the- oretical entities of which would still be integral parts of the general structure of social theory. A second major deficiency has been the fact that the indefinite and conflicting congeries of social-science theories have had no systematic empirical testing. Some portions of social theory, classical economics, for example, have been absorbed in a system of generalizations so abstract at times as to be inhibited from a genuine attempt at empirical demonstration. A notable attempt to make a substantial con- tribution to this problem appears in the volume under con- sideration. I One of the central objects of Professor Parsons' study is to demonstrate the validity epistemologically of a general theoreti- cal system-a science. His position is partly polemical in that he is, on the one hand, attacking those who hold that "the progress of scientific knowledge consists essentially in the cumu- lative piling up of 'discoveries' of 'fact,' " that "theory would consist only in generalization from known facts" and would 'This article is an extended review of Talcott Parsons' The Structure of Social Action: A Sttudy in Social Theory with Special Reference to a Group of Recent European Writers (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., I937).

It is obvious that a fairly long review of such a substantial work as this can only touch upon certain major emphases and must of necessity leave unmentioned a great mass of reasoning, qualifica- tion, and illustration. The reader is urged to examine the volume itself before forming any too definite conclusions.

His position is further polemical in that, as a disciple of Max Weber, he is engaged in a vigorous defense of the essential struc- ture of Weber's theoretical system and of his empirical conclu- sions. The book, however, goes much beyond these polemics in the development of its central thesis. The facts with which a science deals, in Professor Parsons' view, are not the phenomena with which the science is con- cerned. The term "fact," as employed in the book, is under- stood to be an "empirically verifiable statement about phe- nomena in terms of a conceptual scheme" (41).3 Hence "a fact is not itself a phenomenon at all, but a proposition about one or more phenomena." Furthermore, a phenomenon cannot be completely known; the concepts which describe it to the mind are abstractions the completeness of which is a matter of de- gree.4 "Scientific truth is not an all-or-none proposition, but a matter of successive approximation." The concepts of scientific truth are implicitly or explicitly an integral part of a "conceptual scheme" or theoretical system. Knowledge is inconceivable in terms of an indefinite number of disparate discrete impressions. What makes sense is a system of relationships which is knowable. Hence knowledge of even a given phenomenon is a concept or body of concepts which may be broken down into a series of propositions ("facts") having a definite relation to one another (chair, for example). Deriving 2Those of whom Marshall said: "The most reckless and treacherous of all theorists is he who professes to let facts and figures speak for themselves." 3 Quoting L. J. Henderson: "There is no empirical knowledge which is not in some sense and to some degree conceptually formed" (28). 4 See C. D. Broad, Mind and Its Place in Nature (New York, I929). (Not cited by Professor Parsons.)</page><page sequence="3">I66 ETHICS knowledge from experience is in a sense resolving percepts into concepts and fitting the concepts into a conceptual scheme. "A theoretical proposition .... is either itself a statement of fact or a statement of a mode of relations between facts" (7), and "theory proper is confined to the formulation and logical interrelations of propositions containing empirical facts in direct relation to the observation of the facts and thus empirical verification of the propositions" (24). A system of theory must be empirically verifiable to be valid, and it must also be logically meaningful. It is the function of the theoretical system to make the world of empirical phenomena understandable. It progresses by caus- ing the scientist to explore phenomena in the effort accurately to describe them and to fit the resulting concepts into the general system. "A scientifically unimportant discovery of fact is one which, however true and however interesting for other reasons, has no consequences for a system of theory with which scientists in that field are concerned" (7). On the other hand, from any practical point of view, scientific discoveries of great importance may be quite trivial. The new discovery may be, for example (and frequently is), a new way of looking at the same phenomena. The Copernican versus the Ptolemaic is almost a matter of conceptual orienta- tion-a difference between thinking of the observer as at the center or on the periphery of the universe.5 Likewise, the dif- ference between relativity and the Newtonian physics. Thus one theoretical system gives the most complete explanation of phe- nomena until new facts (as above defined) upset the structure and require a reconstruction or a new theory. The construction and exploration of the new theory-seeking empirical verifica- tion and logical coherence-lead to new insights. This phenomenon need not be put on so grand a scale, for it is 5 See Trigant Burrow, Social Basis of Consciousness (New York, I927), for the use of this comparison in psychology. In this section I am giving a somewhat free interpreta- tion of what I understand Professor Parson's position to be.</page><page sequence="4">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION i67 an everyday experience in the field of sensory perception. Per- ceptions tend to become habitual precipitates of our personal pattern of concepts, and we are constantly discovering that things are not what they seem because we have been looking at them in the wrong way. Psychologists have accumulated a vast assortment of examples of this. It is the contention of Professor Parsons that a scientific theory is an independent variable. As a logical system of facts it is real. It is, also, atemporal-belonging to the class of eternal objects and not subject to the space-time frame of reference (763). It makes an independent contribution to science as a whole. Scientific systems of theory, however, by no means compre- hend all conceptual schemes, nor do they provide complete knowledge of the concrete. To take the last point first, not only is every concept to some degree an abstraction but scientific theory achieves its logical completeness through the use of conceptual tools some of which have a high degree of abstrac- tion. The use of the ideal type is one example. The ideal type is a hypothetical construction which has abstract generality and is an "ideal-typical exaggeration of empirical reality" (605).6 A frictionless machine, a perfect gas, a perfectly rational act, a perfect system of free competition, the Brahmanic philosophy, the Calvinistic theology, are illustrations. Such ideal types are "unreal" in an empirical sense but real in a meaningful sense. Each type, to be ideal, must be a universal-that is, representa- tive of a class in that it contains all the elements essential to that class of objects (6i6). A second example is the analytical element. The analytical element is a general property common to a class of objects-as the mass, velocity, location of a physical object, or the ration- ality of an act. These elements are also universals in that they are universally common to a class (or classes) of objects. Every 6 "The ideal type .... is a hypothetically concrete entity, a state of affairs or a process or a unit in one of these" (6i5).</page><page sequence="5">I68 ETHICS ideal type contains a set of analytical elements by which the concrete phenomenon is described.7 "A complete scientific theory is not attained until all possible concrete types of a class of historical individuals8 (or concretely thinkable type-parts9 of them) can be thought of as exemplify- ing different combinations according to laws, of the same ana- lytical and structural elements" (624). The ideal types contain a system of analytical elements which are pertinent to the the- ory in question, and the whole constitutes an abstraction in so far as the empirical reality is concerned. Thus, when an indi- vidual commits suicide by jumping from a bridge, the totality of the event is not of interest to every scientific theoretical system which may have a part in explaining it. Theoretical physics will analyze and explain the event in terms quite irrelevant to a theory of social action. Systems of scientific theory do not include all conceptual schemes. A conceptual scheme may be unscientific in that it in- volves ignorance and error (erroneous concepts, illogical order- ing of concepts). But a conceptual scheme may also be non- scientific, "involving considerations outside the range of scien- tific competence altogether" (456). Thus the ultimate ends of action prescribed by a religious system cannot be classed as scientific theory-no empirical verification is possible.I" So also the means involved to achieve such ends, such as ritual acts, are outside the scope of scientific theory-they are not subject to empirical verification. This does not mean that unscientific and nonscientific con- ceptual schemes are outside of scientific interest. They are real, 7 "The relations between the values of analytical elements which are important to the formulation of the type are always the same whatever may be their particular values and those of other elements" (6I7). 8 A "historical individual" may be a religious system, a cultural system, or a single act or event. 9 Example: the professional priesthood as an element of Greek society (624). IO "Values are either accepted or rejected; they are not proved or disproved as facts are" (277). "Not only can a 'religion' not be 'demonstrated,' ipso facto, it cannot be 'refuted' by reference to 'facts' " (277 n.).</page><page sequence="6">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION i69 they are objects, and they are of extreme importance to con- crete action. "Untrue" theories, if believed, may have a high degree of importance (social utility) in the motivation of action (276). A theory of social action, therefore, must comprehend them as elements, not as explanations. Facts,that is,propositions may be made about them. They may, for example, be treated as symbols, or as evidences of a state of mind, or as elements in a means-end schema in action on a symbol-meaning level. Since, in the nature of the case, concepts and conceptual schemes suffer varying degrees of abstraction, and since scien- tific knowledge only approaches completeness in an asymptotic fashion, the natural and the social sciences are logically in the same position. So also "logically the natural and social sciences are in the same situation with respect to the standard so often applied, predictability" (582). The difference is one of degree and of purpose. Scientific theory is teleological; complete knowledge of all the facts is impossible; hence "a standard of adequacy of knowledge must be relative to the scientific purpose in hand."" Professor Parsons is concerned with the construction (and emergence) of a theory of action-a theory which he calls the "voluntaristic theory of action." To understand the ultimate system at which he arrives, it is necessary to examine some basic assumptions and definitions. In what Professor Parsons describes as the utilitarian branch of the positivist theory of action2.... the central fact-a fact beyond all question-is that in certain aspects and to certain degrees, under certain conditions, human action is rational. That is, men -Professor Parsons gives no adequate demonstration of useful prediction in the social sciences, though his logical position seems sound. For practical purposes, how- ever, a distinction in degree may be often sufficient to have the effect of a distinction in kind. 12 At pp. 77-86 Professor Parsons gives a "Schematic Outline of System Types in the Theory of Action": "A theory of action is positivistic in so far as, explicitly or im- plicitly, it treats scientifically valid empirical knowledge as the actor's sole theoretically significant mode of subjective orientation to his situation."</page><page sequence="7">I70 ETHICS adapt themselves to the conditions in which they are placed and adapt means to their ends in such a way as to approach the most efficient manner of achieving these ends. And the relations of these means and conditions to the achievement of their ends are "known" to be intrinsically verifiable by the methods of empirical science [i9]. The concept of a rational means-end schema is not, however, sufficiently comprehensive.'3 This is because, by definition, "ra- tional" is limited in its application to a particular type of means- end relationship. "Action is rational in so far as it pursues ends possible within the conditions of the situation, and by means which, among those available to the actor, are intrinsically best adapted to the end for reasons understandable and verifiable by positive empirical science" (58). It is obvious that there is a vast amount of human action which does not fit this prescrip- tion. The minute the ends become unverifiable, then also do the means as efficient methods of reaching the ends. In situations in which the means-end relationship is one of symbolism (ar- bitrary meaningful relationship) rather than of intrinsic cause and effect, the action is nonrational and must be comprehended under a different conception of the elements of action. The core of the theory of action is the unit act'4 which must be defined in terms of properties without which it is impossible to conceive of the "unit" existing. These properties are de- scribed as follows (properties of "act"): (i) It implies an agent, an "actor."I' (2) For purposes of definition the act must have an "end," a future state of affairs toward which the process 13 "As opposed to all types of positivistic theory the basic tenet of the voluntaristic is that neither positively nor negatively does the methodological schema of scientifically valid knowledge exhaust the significant subjective elements of action" (8i). 4 "A unit in a concrete system is the entity which constitutes the common reference of a combination of statements of fact made within a frame of reference in such a way that the combination may, for purposes of the theoretical system in question, be con- sidered an adequate description of an entity which, within the frame of reference, con- ceivably exists independently. The theoretical unit is the specific combination of logical universals in specific logical relations to each other into which these statements of fact are fitted" (35). IS "The unit of reference which we are considering as the actor is not this organism but an 'ego' or 'self.' The principal importance of this consideration is that the body of the actor forms, for him, just as much part of the situation of action as does the 'ex- ternal environment'" (47).</page><page sequence="8">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION I71 of action is oriented.'6 (3) It must be initiated in a "situation" of which the trends of development differ in one or more important respects from the state of affairs to which the action is oriented, the end. This situation is in turn analyzable into two elements: those over which the actor has no control, that is, which he cannot alter, or prevent from being altered, in conformity with his end, and those over which he has such control. The former may be termed the "conditions" of action, the latter the "means." Finally (4) there is inherent in the conception of this unit, in its analytical uses, a certain mode of relationship between these elements. That is, in the choice of alternative means to the end, in so far as the situation allows alternatives, there is a "normative'7 orientation" of action [441. These properties are analytical elements'8 and, as indicated above, appear in the concrete type (ideal type- the unit) in a fixed relationship. When these elements are spoken of subse- quently as a frame of reference,' the element "actor" is dropped. For instance: "It takes a certain number of these con- crete elements to make up a complete unit act, a concrete end, concrete conditions, concrete means, and one or more norms governing the choice of means to the end" (73I), or "ends, means, conditions, norms" (732). It is not apparent from the discussion whether this is intentional or not. Critical reference will be made to it below. The unit act is, of course, an abstraction. There is no linear and isolated means-end operation. The unit act is best thought i6 "An end, then, in the analytical sense must be defined as the difference between the anticipated future state of affairs and that which it could have been predicted would ensue from the initial situation without the agency of the actor having intervened" (49). I7 "Normative here means a teleological element only from the point of view of the actor. It has no ethical connotation for the observer" (49 n.). "A norm is a verbal de- scription of the concrete course of action thus regarded as desirable combined with an injunction to make certain future actions conform to this course" (75). I8 "An analytical element is any universal (or combination of universals) of which the corresponding values (or combination of values) may be stated as facts which in part determine a class of concrete phenomena. 'Determine' here means that a change in these values within the framework of the same universal(s) involves a corresponding change in the concrete phenomena in respects important to the theoretical system" (35). '9 "The scientific function of a descriptive frame of reference is to make it possible to describe phenomena in such a way as to distinguish those facts about them which are relevant to and capable of explanation in terms of a given theoretical system from those which are not" (735).</page><page sequence="9">I72 ETHICS of as a knot through which pass several means-end chains. The pattern of action may be thought of as an infinitely complicated web of means-end chains tied together by unit-act knots. The abstractness of some of the above concepts, on the one hand, and the significance of the voluntaristic theory of action, on the other, may be illustrated by some additional considera- tions. Society may be thought of as having a mechanical solidarity -that is, a system of mechanical relationships in space as rep- resented in a division of labor based on habituation (after Durk- heim, 320), and this mechanical arrangement of parts is the foundation for an organic solidarity of a higher order. A me- chanical whole may be broken up into parts and the concrete part, when separated from the whole, remains the same. Now precisely in so far as a whole is organic this becomes impossible. The very definition of an organic whole is as one within which the relations determine the properties of its parts. The properties of the whole are not simply the resultant of the latter. This is true whether it be an organism or some other unit, such as a "mind," a "society" or what not. And in so far as this is true, the concept "part" takes on an abstract, indeed a "fictional" character. For the part of an organic whole is no longer the same, once it is separated factually or conceptually from the whole [32]. In what, then, is the organic wholeness of society to be found? It is in a system of norms or ultimate value elements which appears only in a social order and which has an empirically verifiable determining effect upon conduct-action. Thus Pro- fessor Parsons finds in Pareto "one of the most important ver- sions of what may be called the sociologistic theorem, that so- ciety is a reality sui genesis; it has properties not derivable from those of its constituent units by direct generalization," and "this takes the form here of the view that one of the central facts underlying the theorem is the existence of a common end (or system of ends) which disappears when individual actions are considered in isolation" (248). Similarly in Durkheim, Professor Parsons finds that "society</page><page sequence="10">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION I73 exists only in the minds of individuals" (442) but that it con- sists of "a single integrated body of norms as carrying moral authority-a moral community" (389). Without a well-defined system of values shared to some degree with other members of the community the concrete individual is not think- able . In biology an organ is thought of as standing in a purely "factual," not a normative relation to the organism as a whole. There is a functional relation between part and whole. In the case of the social factor the individual is not merely in this factual sense a part of society, but shares also in a community of values the "existence" of which is necessary to and partly explains his factual, functional role [3991. Cognate ideas are found in Weber, but Professor Parsons here approaches the problem differently. While treating Pareto and Durkheim in terms of theoretical, deductive systems with in- cidental reference to empirical verification, in the case of Weber he devotes a large amount of space to defending Weber's logico- empirical proof of the action-determining characteristics of the Protestant ethic in relation to the development of capitalism. This in itself is indicative of the basic importance of a system of value elements to Weber's theory of action. It is clear from what has preceded that there is an important element of subjective reference, for the conceptual scheme of Professor Parsons' theory of social action "is couched in terms of subjective categories, that is, categories referring to aspects or parts of, or elements in, the 'state of mind' of the actor" (82). The concepts which describe the system of value elements toward which an action system is oriented may be admitted to a scientific theory because "they are in fact descriptive of an empirical phenomenon, namely, the state of mind of the actor" (295). This state of mind may be observed explicitly in statements relative to a means-end situation which is intrinsic (a cause-and-effect relationship)-that is, rational. It must be inferred when observed in the form of a symbolical means-end relationship (a relationship of meaning, not of cause and effect) where both symbol (ultimate value element or its representa-</page><page sequence="11">I74 ETHICS tion) and action (ritual or ceremony) are indicative of a state of mind but express a nonrational situation.2o These ultimate value systems-systems of norms affecting action-are emergent properties of social organisms. "Emer- gent," as used by Professor Parsons, "has a strictly empirical meaning, designating general properties of complex systems of phenomena which are, in their particular values, empirically identifiable and which can be shown by comparative analysis to vary, in these particular values, independently of others" (749). 21 In the action group of sciences the main principle for subdividing them is that, "with increasing complexity of con- crete systems, there appear successively new emergent proper- ties which give rise to new theoretical problems not relevant to the more elementary systems" (765). In an action system an almost infinite series of ends may be means to other ends-up to the ultimate value ends. Beginning with his analysis of Pareto, Professor Parsons finds a hierarchy of means-end relationships (240). These may be thought of in general categories as technology, economics, politics, and so- ciology. Technology is highly rational-concerned purely with the discovery and application of the most efficient means to any given concrete end. It is not to be rated a science, for technologies "add relatively little to the systematic analytical theory of action" (770). When the means-end schema arrives at the level where tech- nological considerations are subjected to the economic analysis of relative costs affecting both immediate concrete ends and means,22 we have arrived at the first science. Economics may be defined as "the science which studies the processes of rational 20 "It may be said that action involving transcendental ends and ritual may be re- garded for certain purposes as 'expressions' (in one sense, manifestations) of ultimate value attitudes" (259). 21 "According to this doctrine [emergence] what is peculiar to biological theory is the problems raised by the properties of organisms which are not to be found in their con- stituent physicochemical elements or parts" (765). 22 A shift from "maximizing technological efficiency" to maximizing economic utility-"the allocation of scarce means as between their various potential uses" (233).</page><page sequence="12">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION I75 acquisition of scarce means to the actor's ends by production and economic exchange, and of their rational allocation as be- tween alternative uses" (266). The next emergent property in social action is that of power and coercive order-the struggle for power and the necessity of order to keep the struggle within bounds. "This double as- pect of social action systems, the problem of power relations and order in so far as it may be regarded as a solution of the struggle for power, gives another relatively well-marked set of emergent properties of action systems. These may be called the political action elements" (768). Finally, the solution of these questions of allocation of scarce means, the conflict of power, and order, involves reference "to a common value system, manifested in the legitimacy of insti- tutional norms, in the common ultimate ends of action, in ritual and in various modes of expression. All these phenomena may be referred back to a single general emergent property of social action systems which may be called 'common-value in- tegration'" (768). Sociology may therefore be defined as "the science which attempts to develop an analytical theory of social action systems in so far as these systems can be understood in terms of the property of common-value integration. "23 This is Professor Parsons' theory or science of social action set forth in a brief and sketchy fashion. It is based on an epis- temological attitude which Professor Parsons prefers to call "analytical realism. "24 And "above all, the means-end schema 23 "Thus the principle employed is to classify analytical sciences according to which structural element or group of elements of a generalized system of action constitutes the focus of attention of the science in question" (766). 24 Analytical realism: "As opposed to the fiction view it is maintained that at least some of the general concepts of science are not fictional but adequately 'grasp' aspects of the objective external world. This is true of the concepts here called analytical ele- ments .. These concepts correspond, not to concrete phenomena, but to elements in them which are analytically separable from other elements. There is no implication that the value of any one such element, or even of all those included in one logically coherent system, is completely descriptive of any particular concrete thing or event. Hence it is necessary to qualify the term realism with 'analytical'" (730).</page><page sequence="13">I76 ETHICS becomes the central framework for the causal explanation of ac- tion" (750). And by way of tenatively indicating the possi- bilities of the system, Professor Parsons offers a tentative formu- lation of an analytical law: In any concrete system of action a process of change so far as it is at all explicable in terms of those elements of action formulated in terms of the intrinsic means-end relationship can proceed only in the direction of approach toward the realization of the rational norms conceived as bind- ing on the actors in the system [75I]. III Professor Parsons is of the opinion that his theory of social action has been demonstrated logically and empirically. The exposition of the theory and its demonstration occupies some 775 pages. The theory of demonstration involves several fea- tures. In the first place, it is itself emergent-that is, it has grown out of "the reciprocal interaction of new factual insights and knowledge on the one hand with changes in the theoretical sys- tem on the other." Furthermore, Professor Parsons believes the theory to have been induced by the objective character of the phenomena with which it deals. The demonstration involves two major steps. On the one hand, the essential elements of the system are shown to have been latent in the thinking of four men whose personal backgrounds including scientific training and ideological antecedents have been quite varied. Certain of the elements found to correspond have been fairly explicit. The four men are: Alfred Marshall, a moralistic middle-class Eng- lishman immersed in utilitarian individualism; Vilfredo Pareto, a sophisticated Italian nobleman trained in physical science and economics; Emile Durkheim, Alsatian Jew, radical, anticlerical, and a professor trained in law and philosophy; and Max Weber, a member of the upper German middle class who grew up in the midst of the German idealist tradition and was trained in</page><page sequence="14">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION I77 the historical schools of jurisprudence and economics.25 Profes- sor Parsons labors long and often well to demonstrate conver- gence in the theoretical systems of these men along the lines of the voluntaristic theory of action. Part I of the volume concerns itself with the positivist theory of action, showing that, in Professor Parsons' view, it is inade- quate because it fails to account for the normative element and leads to one of the two views mentioned at the beginning of this article. He is much impressed with the problem of order, as formulated by Hobbes, and the apparent inability of posi- tivist theories to solve it. He then turns to Marshall. This is one of the least satisfactory chapters in the book, being highly wordy and lacking in lucidity. The chief item of importance is that Professor Parsons raises Marshall's moralis- tic pronouncements on "activities" as a mode of expressing qualities of character which he valued on ethical grounds to the level of an embryo normative system in a theory of action. Marshall thought free enterprise valuable because it afforded an opportunity for such activities. And activities created wants rather than vice versa. Analysis of Marshall's "concept of ac- tivities reveals the fact that its nucelus is a value element, a system of common ultimate-value attitudes expressed directly in those actions which are at the same time, from another point of view, wealth getting actions" (453) .26 It is not clear from the discussion whether the value element is Marshall's own value attitude or an objective element in his analysis. The latter is certainly not demonstrated. Pareto, Durkheim, and Weber are the important theorists considered. In Pareto the important elements found by Pro- 25 Some reference is made to the character and certain pertinent ideas of Hobbes, Locke, Malthus, Marx, Darwin, Sombart, and Tonnies. An excellent index including both proper names and topics enables the reader to locate the discussions of these men without difficulty. 26 This would seem to come under Veblen's strictures on "metaphysical preconcep- tions" as to a "meliorative trend" and "benign influence"-"teleologic economics."</page><page sequence="15">I78 ETHICS fessor Parsons are as follows. Action "seems to designate the total complex of concrete phenomena comprising the life of human beings in society in relation to each other, seen from the objective and subjective views combined" (I92). This total- ity of action is divided into logical action ("the result of a process of reasoning") and nonlogical action (which proceeds from "a certain state of mind, sentiment, the unconscious, etc."). Pareto was mainly concerned with an analysis of non- logical action. Nonlogical action is accompanied by nonscien- tific theories. Residues are theoretical constants which are "manifestations of sentiments" (200). The sentiments are re- garded as the determining forces in social equilibrium. As the- ories or theoretical propositions accompanying nonlogical ac- tion, the residues "embody ends, or classes of ends of action which cannot be justified in terms of any scientific theory." That is, they are symbolic of ultimate-value attitudes. If the residues involve a course of action which is destructive, correc- tive conduct may be rationalized. " 'A residue which departs from experience may be corrected by a derivation which de- parts from logic, in such a way that the conclusion approaches the experimental facts' " (227, quoting Pareto). Thus Pareto supplies materials for saying that means-end schema in terms of symbol and meaning may serve as indicators of sentiments or value attitudes. On the logical action side, Pareto posits an abstract (and, as he affirms) empirically impossible society based on logico-ex- perimental reasoning which cannot exist even conceptually save teleologically-that is, there must be an end which such a so- ciety can pursue by logico-experimental reasoning-that is, ac- cording to the means-end schema having an intrinsic cause-and- effect relationship.27 It is in Pareto that appears the logico- experimental reasoning strata-technology seeking efficient means to end, and economics seeking the rational allocation of scarce means. The solution of order, and the field of sociology, 27 Society sui generis (see above, p. I 70).</page><page sequence="16">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION I79 is found in the "single common system of ultimate ends" which holds the whole structure of society together. Durkheim is examined primarily in terms of certain basic ideas implicit in his Division of Labor and Le Suicide. He found that contractual relations were "actually entered into in ac- cordance with a body of binding rules which are not part of the ad hoc agreement of the parties" (31 i). Thus there is a set of rules, norms (values implicit) defining immediate ends of specific action chains. But there is also the conscience collective which is made up of an integrated system of value elements having authority. This authority operates primarily by sub- jective compulsion-that is, through an attitude of respect or moral obligation. Here again is society sui generis-a moral community. Empirically Durkheim's work is founded on his study of social differentiation in the Division of Labor and social inte- gration and disintegration in Le Suicide. In the latter he dis- covered a significant relationship between suicide and a break in the integration of an individual ego with a general system of values-the conscience collective.28 A considerable evolution in Durkheim's ideas is traced by Professor Parsons, but the ulti- mate outcome is an independent status for the system of ulti- mate-value elements29-that is, a status independent of heredity and environment. The quality of Durkheim's view of this ulti- mate-value element can be seen in his definition of religion and the function of ritual. "A religion for Durkheim is 'an inte- grated system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, 28 This should, according to Parsons, be preferably translated conscience-not con- sciousness. 29 The conscience collective "is rather a body of ideas which themselves form the effective factor in action, that is, the effective factor is itself present 'in the minds of individuals,' not merely a representation of it. To be sure the ideas are still conceived as representations of something. But this something is not a contemporaneously existent observed empirical entity, but is in part a state of affairs which will come into being or be maintained in so far as the normative elements in fact determine the actual course of action. It is not a present, but a future state of affairs in the empirical world to which they refer. It is this, in one aspect, which makes it impossible to fit such ideas into the category of scientific fact" (389).</page><page sequence="17">i8o ETHICS that is separate and taboo, which unite in one moral community called a church all those who adhere to it' "(4I2). Ritual is not mere "manifestation," for "it is through the agency of ritual that the ultimate-value attitudes, the sentiments on which the social structure and solidarity depend, are kept 'tuned up' to a state of energy which makes the effective control of action and ordering of social relationships possible" (436). The last and, obviously for Professor Parsons, the most im- portant man is Max Weber. The discussion of Weber centers around an empirical problem-the relation of the Protestant ethic to capitalism.30 Capitalism is characterized in Weber's view by acquisition, the pursuit of gain, in a "continuous, ra- tionally conducted enterprise" (505). It involves the "rational organization of free labor" (5o6) and is further characterized by bureaucracy-"a mechanism founded on discipline," in which there is a strong element of the impersonal performance of official tasks. The "spirit of capitalism .... is a set of atti- tudes toward the acquisition of money and the activities in- volved in it" (5I3) which relies heavily on the "disinterested impersonal devotion to a specialized task" (5I5) essential to the functioning of a bureaucracy.3' The Protestant ethic by, in the course of its evolution, transmuting the doctrine of salva- tion by predestination (Calvinism) to salvation by good works (good works being not the cause but the sign of the elect) which came to be identified with the duty to save-to accumulate wealth-was a causal factor in the development of capitalism.32 30 Professor Parsons is the translator of Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. 3I According to Professor Parsons, Weber looks upon this "disinterested impersonal devotion" as a "calling" and as characteristic of modern capitalism. Professor Parsons correlates it with the "instinct of workmanship" but if I understand the two ideas rightly, Veblen's instinct of workmanship is a very different thing-certainly not to be associated with the activities of that class in capitalist society, businessmen, who are the dominant actors in the pursuit of pecuniary gain. 32 "But since individual good works could not affect grace, and outward conduct could at most be a sign of grace, the conduct enjoined could be judged only as a total coherent system, as the expression of the kind of man one was, not as a plurality of dis- connected acts" (526).</page><page sequence="18">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION i8i Thus the Protestant ethic comes to be a system of ultimate- value concepts which sanction the acquisition spirit of capital- ism-not only as a permissive factor but as a compulsive factor requiring good works (accumulation of wealth) as evidence of belonging in the company of the 6lite. This general theory rests empirically upon an extensive tracing of the development of the Protestant ethic, a compari- son of the capitalistic success of Protestants and Catholics, and an elaborate experiment in logico-empirical reasoning by which a significant element of a complex process is "thought away" and the resulting hypothetical situation is examined to discover the possible causal effects of the "missing" (thought-away) fac- tor.33 Empirically, Weber engages in a vast assembly of the facts of religious typology and then, upon examination of India and China, finds that the reason capitalism did not develop in either one lies primarily in the difference in the prevailing re- ligious ethics. The steps are outlined as follows: i. By contrast with other civilizations, rational bureaucratic organiza- tion and closely related forms are major elements in the distinctive social structure of the modern West. 2. There is a congruence of the ethic of ascetic Protestantism with the bureaucratic rational bourgeois element of modern Western capitalism and its Geist. 3. There is a lack of congruence with the spirit of capitalism of the ethical implications of the major Asiatic religions. In so far as they have 33 After von Shelting "the indispensable steps are as follows: (i) Analysis of this complex phenomenon (or process) in such a way that it is broken down into elements of such a character that each of them may be subsumed under a general law (Regel des Geschehens). (2) There is presupposed previous knowledge of such general laws. (3) Hypothetical elimination or alteration of one or more factors of the process, concern- ing which it is wished to raise the question of its (or their) causal significance for the result. (4) Hypothetical construction of what would then (after the elimination or al- teration) be the expected course of events (application of the category of objective pos- sibility). (5) Comparison of the hypothetical conception of a possible development (really that which would have been possible had certain things happened differently) with the actual course of events. (6) On the basis of this comparison, the drawing of causal conclusions. The general principle is that, in so far as the two, the actual and the possible, courses of events differ, the difference may be causally imputed to the factors 'thought away' or considered as changed" (6o-sii).</page><page sequence="19">I82 ETHICS had an influence on secular social life it could not have been in a rational bourgeois capitalistic direction..... 4. In general there is a high degree of correspondence between what, on the basis of "ideal-typical" construction, the concrete social influence of the three religious ethics treated here would be expected to be, and the actual state of affairs..... 5. In a considerable part of the field, though not in all, Weber has been able to trace the unfolding of the actual processes and mechanisms by which this influence has probably been exerted..... 6. Weber has not established and never meant to establish that other than religion elements have not to a highly important degree been in- volved both in the concrete process of development of a religious ethic itself, and in that of its influence on concrete social affairs..... 7.

Professor Parsons ap- proves this method as "a perfectly valid scientific method pro- vided, of course, that Weber's allegations of fact are correct" (513). And then he goes on: "A closer approach to 'proof' is probably not attainable in a field of empirical theses of similar dimensions" (513). Professor Parsons goes even farther: On this basis, then, it seems justified to accept Weber's theory of the relations of Protestantism and capitalism, in the only sense in which it is ever justified to accept a scientific theory. Within the limits of its own claims, it is in conformity with all the facts with which the present author is acquainted. The facts brought against it in the critical literature will 34 Another specific example is given by asking what would have happened if the Persians had won the Battle of Marathon. The argument is that, if the outcome had favored the Persians, the balance of power between the civic cults inside the polis and the professional priestly class outside would have been upset and thus the secularizing process would have been checked. This is so because a Persian victory "(i) would have destroyed the political autonomy of the polis and with it the whole development of citizenship with which the 'state-religion' was bound up; (2) the professional religious element would have been very useful to a Persian regime as a means of domestication and hence the latter would have done everything to promote the former's influence (this happened in Judea)" (613).</page><page sequence="20">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION i83 not stand examination with respect both to their factual correctness as such and to their relevance to and importance for Weber's problems [577].3s With his conclusion of the analysis of Weber, Professor Par- sons finds that Weber's system fits in with the general analysis and adds some thereto: The catalogue of the structural elements of action discernible in or directly inferable from Weber's systematic scheme of ideal types has now been completed. It has proved possible to identify and assign to a clear and definite role in the general scheme every single element of the previous analysis, especially as gained from the study of the work of Pareto and Durkheim. Moreover, every one of these elements, if it emerges in their work in clear-cut form at all, can be given a formulation that will fit both the theoretical schemes and the empirical interpretations of all three writers and do justice to what, according to the best interpretation a careful analysis has been able to put upon them, these writers themselves meant by their theories. This definitely and finally establishes the con- vergence that it has been the principal object of this study to demon- strate. Finally, in Weber there has emerged still another structural ele- ment, the orientation of forms of expression to norms of taste, which fills a gap left in the other schemes [682].36 Finally, Professor Parsons concludes with a set of verified conclusions which include both the demonstration of the volun- 35 "When it is necessary to make a very complex judgment of causal imputation, as in the relation of the Protestant ethic to modern capitalism, the historical individual concerned must be analyzed into a larger number of type-units. Each of these must be subjected to judgments of probability as to its line of development under the relevant circumstances. These judgments rest on construction. Hence the predictability of a hypothetical objectively possible concrete state is naturally subject to error, in the case of the construction of each element, to say nothing of the totality of elements. Hence objective empirical certainty is out of the question; the judgment can be only one of probability. In this sense Weber speaks of adequacy when the great majority of the causally relevant type-units that might have influenced a given historical individual are favorable to the particular thesis" (629). 36 Veblen offered a foundation for a theory of convergence which, while much less precise than that of Professor Parsons, is less an occasion for wonderment also: "That is to say, science and the scientific point of view will vary characteristically in response to those variations in the prevalent habits of thought which constitute the sequence of cultural development; the current science and the current scientific point of view, the knowledge sought and the manner of seeking it, are a product of the cultural growth" (Place of Science in Modern Civilization and Other Essays [New York, I9I9], p. 38).

Words are used in assorted senses; there is such a vast number of "important" points, "deeper" mean- ings, etc., that the reader loses perspective. It is to be hoped that Professor Parsons will restate his voluntaristic theory of action in rigorously logical terms, with economy of verbiage and without reference to other authors. Such a statement would help to get the system clearly in mind in the form in which Professor Parsons conceives it. In general, it is a highly significant piece of work. The at- tempt to devise a scientific system which comprehends social action as far as our scientific and theoretical technology will permit seems to me to be of the utmost importance. The reso- lution of the conflict between positivism and idealism by the development of the unit act, ideal types, and analytical ele-</page><page sequence="22">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION i85 ments concepts, as the basic common elements of action analy- sis which can be applied to the general field of action including the factor of normative or value elements, seems to me a most fruitful step. If I have read the work rightly, it also makes a definite contribution to resolving the Aristotelian-Platonic con- troversy over what is real-the concrete or the ideal-by mak- ing both empirical factors in a general action system. I am not, however, satisfied with the system itself, its em- pirical verification, or its scientific application.37 As first stated the analytical elements of the system include actor, end, situation-including conditions and means-and a norm (44). Thereafter little is said about the actor, and that factor is dropped in stating the frame of reference later on. Even in the "Schematic Outline of System Types in the Theory of Action" (77) the actor is omitted from every type. Hence the structure of social action is stated without the actor. The actor, it should be remembered, is not the organism, but the ego or self (47). Hence the "body forms, for him [the actor], just as much a part of the system of action as does the external environment." So far as the actor is concerned, factors of hered- ity and environment are objective to him-are means and con- ditions-choses external to the actor in Durkheim's phrase. But environment is subject to a division-the material envi- ronment, as the word is commonly used, and the social environ- ment which appears in the voluntaristic theory of action as systems of norms or value elements. The identification of heredity and environment as external to the ego makes it possible to avoid an analysis of the distinc- tion between the two-if any exists-and also leaves the actor 37 Professor Parsons lays down his own criteria by which his work is to be judged: "If a critic is to charge neglect of the importance of such things, he should be able to show either (a) that the neglected consideration bears specifically on the limited range of theoretical problems to which this study has been deliberately limited and that its correct consideration would significantly alter the conclusions about them or (b) that the whole conception of the nature of science and its development here advanced is so fundamentally wrong that these criteria of importance are inapplicable" (20).</page><page sequence="23">I86 ETHICS an extremely nebulous sort of entity, though it is emphasized that an actor which is not in another aspect an organism is em- pirically inconceivable (84). So, also, no method is suggested as to how either the actor or the observer is to distinguish the "social" environment from environment generally, since in any cognitive sense they are inextricably intermingled in conceptual representations to the actor. Indeed, the actor as an unadorned ego seems about as an ephemeral an abstraction as anyone could desire to omit from a theory of action. It is obvious that there is something incomplete here. Per- haps a related element is the absence from the theory of the element of energy or effort. The references to effort are inci- dental, but they do imply that it is a significant element in a voluntaristic theory of action (I4I, I47, 253, 298, 396, 440, 467). Yet effort or energy occupies no place in the structural scheme. 8 It seems extraordinary that a theory of action could be stated and discussed at such length with so little reference to this factor. It is like constructing a science of physics with no reference to force. If one is concerned at all with dynamics, and surely the voluntaristic theory of action is, he must take account of those social forces or valences that approach asymp- totically toward equilibrium or move constantly away from it. I have the feeling that part of the difficulty lies in Professor Parsons' ignoring the psychologists and social psychologists. He does make one reference to the Gestaltists and Koffka, but in general they are not considered. This is peculiar, and yet seems to be a persistent trait of economists and sociologists. They seem to consider themselves superior to the work of scien- tists in the field of psychology. 38 "Finally, there is an element which does not fall within any of these three struc- tural groups as such but serves rather to bind them together. It is that which has been encountered at various points and called 'effort.' This is a name for the relating factor between the normative and the conditional elements of action. It is necessitated by the fact that norms do not realize themselves automatically but only through action, so far as they are realized at all. It is an element the analytical status of which in the theory of action is probably closely analogous to that of energy in physics" (7M9).</page><page sequence="24">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION i87 I think it particularly bad for Professor Parsons in attempting the construction of a theory of social action which, in its great emphasis on norms and the subjective, is so much concerned with social psychology, to fail to profit by the work done in that field. For example, the work of Professor J. F. Brown, of the Uni- versity of Kansas, as represented in Psychology and the Social Order; An Introduction to the Dynamic Study of Social Fields is pertinent to the problem of a theory of social action. Profes- sor Brown describes an organism as a "system of energy" and psychology is defined as the "science which studies the inte- grated and goal-directed behavior of organisms." He then de- velops a system of topology which deals with positional rela- tionships which are independent of distance and direction. He is thus able to construct "regions," or social fields, in which he can locate individuals and groups, indicate direction of psycho- logical forces (by vectors), and develop a scale of relative mag- nitudes of directional forces. In Professor Brown's treatment the ego may also be analytically separated as "the percipient part of the self" but much of the field theory in terms of per- sonality genesis corresponds to that of Freud. Now the significance of the field theory and Freudian con- ceptions of personality genesis lies in their postulating a force concept-vectors in the field theory, basic urges in Freudian thought. Action does not take place except as the result of tensions, and the tensions are generated primarily within the organism.39 The external environment (material or social) may condition-facilitate or repress- the actions which release these tensions.40 39 Professor Parsons says: "Action must always be thought of as involving a state of tension between two different orders of elements, the normative and the conditional." (Since the conditional elements are exterior to the ego-actor, it may be possible to con- ceive of tension between hereditary and normative, or physiological and normative, factors.) 40-The reader should investigate the field theory himself. Unfortunately, Professor Brown's application of his system is none too happy. For a conception of the problem in</page><page sequence="25">i88 ETHICS Without entering into a lengthy analysis of the problem (which would require another book, no doubt), it seems to me quite evident that a theory of action based upon the prime in- fluence of the means-end schema in terms of the rational norm, or systems of value elements in nonrational situations is quite inadequate if it omits the energy concept, especially when the latter is embodied in such extensively developed systems of analyses as the field theory of social psychology and Freudian psychology. In Professor Parsons' case this may be due to an undue reliance upon Weber, whose psychological positions seem to me frequently defective, and to some basic predilections which will be mentioned below. Another approach to the difficulty may be through consider- ation of the means-end schema which plays such an important part in Professor Parsons' theory. He says: "Above all, the means-end schema becomes the central framework for the causal explanation of action" (750). The end is the "anticipated future state of affairs" which is to ensue as the result of the actor's intervention in the situation with the means at his com- mand. Is this a causal explanation of action or a descriptive explanation of the direction action takes? Veblen suggested that the idea of cause and effect is an anthropomorphic metaphysical imputation to consecutive sequence in phenomena.41 For cause and effect cannot be observed. It is, however, a necessary postu- late for understanding-for an explanatory system of logic. Is the postulate that the subjectively held end is the causal factor in action a valid postulate? Personally, I doubt it very much. And even if, in some degree, the end is causal, what causes the actor to adopt the end? Is it, as the theory of action implies, a normative system? And in so far as such a system does de- Freudian terms see Burrow, op. cit. This latter study has much in common with Durkheim's theoretical development from Le Suicide. 4I Veblen, op. cit.

Keyser, Mathematical Philosophy (New York, 1922).</page><page sequence="26">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION i89 termine ends, what gives rise to the system? (This is Weber's basic weakness.) And what determines the valence of action toward immediate or ultimate ends, or immediate ends in con- flict with ultimate ends? When various actors (cyclothymes and schizothymes, for example)42 are exposed to the same norm- ative systems, what accounts for differences in action-both in direction and in valence? The means-end schema does not seem to me to fill adequately the need for a postulate of causality in the explanation of action. And the omission of the actor and the element of force or energy from the theory of action seems to me a great defect. These defects may in part be due to failure to give sufficient attention to ends, value systems, and norms as rationalizations. This was, of course, discussed-especially in connection with Pareto. But the rationalization of interests and emotions in terms of value elements and systems of such elements is such an all-pervading phenomenon that it needs constantly to be guarded against. Thus the postulate of ends as causes of action puts the observer in a most precarious position as regards ac- curate description of the phenomena. Certainly, if Freud and the psychoanalysts have done nothing else, they have demon- strated this.A But Weber and Parsons accept the subjective reference quite readily without, it seems to me, a sufficient "be- wareness" of the dangers in its use.44 On a large scale this seems to apply to Weber's presumed verification of the causal character of the Protestant ethic in 42 See E. Kretschmer, Physique and Character (New York, 1925). 43 See citations in nn. 40 and 4I. 44 Paraphrasing Weber's defense, Professor Parsons says: "Far from the natural sci- ences having the advantage in understandability, in principle the reverse is true. For in nature we can only observe the external course of events and discover elements of uniformity. This is equally possible for human behavior but in addition the scientist is able to impute motives to men, to 'interpret' their actions and words as expressions of these motives. That is, we have access to the subjective aspect of action" (583). Pro- fessor C. J. Friedrich takes a similar view. See the first chapter in his Constitutional Government and Politics (New York, I937). Excellent as the book is, I think it contains defects traceable to the acceptance of this position.</page><page sequence="27">I90 ETHICS the development of capitalism. The empirical proof was accom- plished by a vast comparative cultural analysis which concluded that different religious ethics were the prime factors in the failure of capitalism to develop in China and India. Professor Parsons accepts the demonstration while admitting that an objective analysis of the empirical evidence would take a life- time. I do not, however, accept Weber's proof. There are three reasons. (I) The empirical evidence is on too complex and on too vast a scale for me to consider the religious ethics as ade-- quately isolated independent variables. Weber's failure to give a causal demonstration of the evolution of the Protestant ethic" confirms this position. (2) Spengler, who is also considered to have ranged over a vast field of empirical evidence, comes to quite different conclusions. For instance, Weber takes for his period in China the time since the consolidation of the Empire down to recent times and bases his analysis heavily on Con- fucianism. Spengler, however, estimates that the period in Chi- nese history which is "contemporary" with the rise of Protes- tantism and capitalism was about 8oo-500 B.C., and Confucius lived 55I-478 B.C. The case is similar for India. I am not pre- pared to say that Spengler is right and Weber wrong. I do say, however, that there is enough in the Spenglerian thesis to war- rant not accepting Weber's demonstration of proof by the "as if" "if .... would" technique. (3) Weber's (and Parsons') demonstration has the aspect of a brief-the desire to prove a case. And right here, in a sense, is the crux of the problem. What are the systems of norms governing the theorizing activities of Weber and Parsons? What determines the selection of immedi- ate ends in the development of this particular theory of action? How is the observer to discover the factors which will demon- strate (I) whether the action is rational or nonrational-and to what degree-(2) and how is the observer (as a scientist) to 45 As presented in the volume under discussion.</page><page sequence="28">THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ACTION I9I demonstrate that such ends as he is able to observe are (taken together with the means available) an adequate causal explana- tion of the action-or any causal explanation at all? I raise this question because there seems to be in Weber the "inarticulate major premise" that ideal systems are creative and desirably so. And this seems likely, even though, as Pro- fessor Parsons indicates, some of Weber's polemical position was oriented against certain doctrines of the idealist school (58o). As pointed out above, Professor Parsons accepts Weber's position. It seems to include a postulate of free will-or at least some human creative factor. This creative factor lies in the systems of value elements, norms, which govern the selec- tion of immediate ends. I find it necessary to suppose some such underlying affective factor to account for Professor Parsons' seemingly uncritical defense of Weber's empirical demonstra- tion.46 But, as an observer, I am embarrassed by the potentiali- ties for error in attempting to state what Professor Parsons' system of ends governing his action may be. When Professor Parsons applies his system by suggesting the analytical law (quoted above, p. I76), further doubts arise. It is a concept of increasing rationality in an action system which is "at all explicable in terms of the intrinsic means-end relation- ship." It is a statement of the direction of change, and on the next page (752) Professor Parsons compares it to the second law of thermodynamics and mentions the fatalistic parallel present in Weber's thought relative to the decline of "charismatic en- ergy." But he does not mention Henry Adams, who applied the law to social energy and conceived of reason as the energy of lowest intensity rather than highest-implying a decline in rationality. Professor Parsons makes not even a tentative sug- gestion as to the empirical application of the law. It might be thought of, however, in connection with what Spengler calls the "second religiousness" in the Greco-Roman culture, with the development of what Croce calls "activism" in the fascist 46 See above, p. i82.</page><page sequence="29">i92 ETHICS countries, or with capitalism itself in view of the Marxian doc- trine of inherent self-destroying contradictions or of Veblen's conception of "incontinent variation" which might be equally destructive. A critical analysis of Professor Parsons' theory in relation to a thoroughgoing institutional approach would be interesting, but this paper is already overlong, and such a discussion will have to come another time. It is probable that in the course of so brief a survey of so big a book concerned with so large a subject, I have done Professor Parsons injury in both sins of commission and sins of omission. I suggest, however, that if the reader has been at all intrigued by this discussion, he devote his attention to the work itself; he will be fruitfully repaid.
