<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Non-companion Species Manifesto: Humans, Wild Animals, and "The Pain of Anthropomorphism" June Dwyer _Manhattan College_ For one species to mourn the death of another is something new under the sun [. . .]. But we, who have lost our [passen ger] pigeons, mourn the loss. Had the funeral been ours, the pigeons would hardly have mourned us. ?Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac, 117 In her 2003 Companion Species Manifesto: Dogs, People, and Significant Otherness, Donna Haraway talks about "cross-species sociality" and "how a dog and handler discover happiness together in the labor of training" (4, 52). She speaks convincingly of the emotionally reward ing reciprocity in canine/human relationships. I know what she's talk ing about. My younger son is a veterinarian; I have watched him bond with cats and dogs all his life. We have talked about the complex and rewarding interspecies relationships he witnesses on a daily basis. But it is his older brother, a field herpetologist and reptile zoo owner, whose early years and present-day work started me thinking about this article and the sentiments expressed by Aldo Leopold in the above passage. Most animals don't care about us nearly as much as we care about them. I was particularly struck by this fact as I watched my older son's burgeoning fascination with reptiles. I saw him transform from an imperially minded little boy (who blithely captured whatever cold blooded creature he could find) into a besotted animal lover (who built large cages, sought out appropriate food and veterinary care, read deeply about his charges, and cried when they died). Did he love them? Yes. Did they love him? No. None of Haraway's inter-species sociality was in evidence with his animals, and no "happiness together." Leopold was right; those snakes and lizards would not have mourned my son's disappearance or death. This uneven relationship, which ethologists often allude to in their</page><page sequence="2">74 June Dwyer writings and which fiction writers and film makers are increasingly considering, is the subject of my non-companion species manifesto. I am not exploring the "joyful intersubjectivity that transcends species bound aries" (114) that Barbara Smuts sees as possible between humans and dogs (and also with certain primates). Rather, I am arguing for a bet ter understanding of the non-reciprocal emotional attachment that humans feel for many animals. It is my contention that this imbalance, most often seen with animal researchers and zookeepers, can benefit both the animals and their human counterparts. But there are unwrit ten rules for these interactions and standards of behavior, which if not observed, may produce disastrous outcomes. When humans treat the non-companion animals in their charge respectfully and fondly as non human Others, who cannot love them in return, they will garner both scientific knowledge and even emotional satisfaction from their work and their relationships. If, however, wild creatures are treated as if they are (at worst) stuffed animal companions or (at best) respected domes tic pets, there will be trouble?because these latter relationships pre suppose both a domestication and a reciprocal affection that do not exist. Abiding by the unwritten rules of interaction with non-companion animals and maintaining the appropriate standards of behavior is extremely difficult. Indeed, failing to do so is not a character flaw but rather a very human tendency. The first and most obvious reason for this failure is that we tend to generalize the successes we have with our pets to all animals. If we can have a loving relationship with a dog, why not one with a fox or a wolf? If we can get a horse to love us, why not a zebra? A second and more controversial reason why I think it is so difficult for us to see non-companion animals as different is that we carry with us childhood memories of what it is like to be an animal and therefore retain a deep-seated affinity for them. In her book Animals in Translation, the autistic animal scientist Temple Grandin sug gests that "Emotionally children are more like animals and autistic people [than adults are], because children's frontal lobes are still grow ing and don't mature until sometime in early adulthood" (89). For Grandin, it is the functions of the frontal lobes?the ability to gener alize and conceptualize, as well as the ability to have complex feel ings?that differentiate humans from animals.1 Children, with their less developed frontal lobes are in consequence more animal-like. Sigmund Freud (who had no knowledge of complex brain physiology)</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review 75 came to a similar conclusion about children's affinity with animals. In Totem and Taboo he states that there is no demarcation between children and animals, no "hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals" (127). If we are to believe Grandin's and Freud's hypotheses, it follows that those who are able to modulate their child hood affinities with animals and to compartmentalize their adult rela tionships with their pets will have success in their dealings with non companion animals. Those who remain childlike will suffer disap pointments at their failures to connect. The two texts I will be using to illustrate the rewards and difficul ties of emotional interaction between humans and non-companion animals both deal with bears. The first is the little-known 1993 short story by Alison Baker called "The Heaven of Animals;" the second is the popular 2005 Werner Herzog documentary film, Grimly Man. Not surprisingly, the texts are relatively recent for, as Andrew Isenberg points out in "The Moral Ecology of Wildlife," the "[s]entimentaliza tion of farm animals and pets was common in the nineteenth century, as an industrializing society romanticized its rural past, but an emo tional regard for wild animals is a distinctly twentieth-century [. . .] phenomenon" (48-9). The bears that concern Baker's and Herzog's protagonists generate this kind of "emotional regard." Both individu als feel love, admiration, and a desire to aid their ursine subjects, but Baker's narrator, the director of a bear restoration project, resists the urge to befriend and make pets of the bears in her charge. Although it is decidedly difficult, she is able to behave like an adult, staying focused and professional; in contrast, Herzog's real-life subject, Timothy Treadwell, steps over the line. Treadwell's behavior is partic ularly affecting and painful to watch because he assumes a childlike understanding between himself and the bears he spends time with; in his head he manufactures a reciprocity of regard that does not exist. The observations and behaviors of several animal researchers can help us appreciate the importance of these one-sided relationships, what in human interactions we might call "unrequited love." Although the term "unrequited love" is anthropomorphic, it serves as a useful descriptor. If we break apart the two elements of this phrase, the "unrequited" part tacitly acknowledges the animal's otherness. Researchers and zookeepers, seeing that their affection is not recipro cated, will curb their feelings of control and possession, instead accepting the integrity of the animal as a subject (as well as an object</page><page sequence="4">76 /////( Dnyer of study). The "love" part of the equation is equally important, because it causes researchers and keepers to be more attentive toward their animals. They notice small changes that may have far-reaching consequences in terms of the animal's health and survival. As Frans de Waal has observed, "Attraction to animals [. . .] sensitizes us to the tini est details of behavior" (39). The acknowledgment of this one-sided love will not satisfy sentimentalists, nor is the topic likely to generate a popular children's book or animal movie, but recognizing it is key to appreciating the benefits inherent in human/non-companion animal relationships. Without these attachments, we risk being arrogant, anthropocentric lords of the natural world; with them, we are respon sible and emotionally vulnerable participants in an environment where we have power, but do not necessarily hold the center stage. Before I turn to the texts that explore these relationships, some def initions are in order. I employ the term "companion animal," which came into use in the middle 1970s in U.S. veterinary schools, inter changeably with the older and more emotionally charged term, "pet" (Haraway 12). According to Keith Thomas, pets (in contrast to other animals) are given names, allowed in the house, and never eaten (112 15). To Thomas's description, I would add four further elements that characterize our relationships with our pets: we caress them; we mourn their loss; we talk to them; and we care deeply about their welfare. Medical research goes so far as to suggest that "the quality of contact between human beings and pets is of a higher level than between indi viduals and most other human beings" (Kete 37). In short, we see pets as individuals and treat them very much the way we ought to (but often do not) treat humans in our care. Even though the balance of power is tilted in our favor, we generally respect pets as subjects.2 With wild animals?the skunks we smell in the night, the raccoons that raid our garbage cans, the deer that cross the road in front of our automobiles?we generally share no such affinity, and toward them we accord considerably less respect. If they have distinctive features, we may recognize them, but both our contact with them and our care for them are limited by our inhabiting different spheres. In between the pet and the completely wild animal lies the middle ground of the zoo animal, the lab animal, and those animals that are observed in field studies. These are the non-companion animals who may recognize us, but certainly do not love us. Yet with the exception of caressing them and allowing them the run of the house, those who work with these</page><page sequence="5">South Atlantic Review 77 animals very often extend to them the same treatment that they accord to their pets. That is, they are given names, talked to, never eaten, care fully treated, and missed?often mourned?when they die. Through it all, the animals do not reciprocate these attentions with affection or much in the way of acknowledgement. These are distinctly one-sided relationships. And they are emotionally charged. This pet-like treatment clearly characterizes the relationship between Baker's protagonist and the bears she cares for in "The Heaven of Animals." She has grown up around zoos, a circumstance that has fostered in her both a scientific knowledge about and an emo tional attachment to the animals whom she sees every day. This mix ture of emotional regard and scientific interest is a common phenom enon among animal researchers. According to primatologist Frans de Waal, "Unfeeling scientists do exist, but the majority take great pleas ure in their animals" (38). He enumerates several prominent researchers who have manifested great affection for the animals whom they study: Konrad Lorenz, Edward O. Wilson, Robert Yerkes, Jane Goodall, Cynthia Moss, Bernd Heinrich, and Ken Norris. In particu lar, he singles out Lorenz, who "didn't believe that one could effective ly investigate an animal that one didn't love" (39). It remains, howev er, for the fiction writers and filmmakers, rather than the scientists, to dramatize these non-reciprocal relationships and to suggest their emo tional complexity as well as their ecological value. "The Heaven of Animals" is on one level simply the story of an animal researcher named Taffy who works as curator of canids and head of her zoo's Bear Restoration Project. On another level, howev er, it demonstrates the non-reciprocal, yet beneficial relationships between those who care for animals and the objects of that care. Although the action of the story consists of the preparation and release back into the wild of two orphaned bear cubs named Buster and Gladly, "The Heaven of Animals" alludes to several other kinds of human/animal interaction. The practices of zoos, the attitudes of hunters, and the wanton killing of wild animals by explorers are all woven into the fabric of Taffy's memories as she thinks about the project of releasing the bears and how her attitudes have been informed by her own upbringing. Perhaps because she is a researcher, she does not privilege herself above animals, but neither does she make excuses for human domination. Her recollections are non-judg mental, showing both the positive and negative side of animal/human</page><page sequence="6">78 June Divyer interactions. For example, her own mother was accidentally shot by hunters when, hanging up laundry on the first day of hunting season, she was mistaken for a white-tailed deer as she shook out a white sock. Yet Taffy, who witnessed this event, bears no anger toward the hunter who killed her mother or toward hunters in general. Indeed, she notes that it was a hunter who found and brought in the orphaned Buster and Gladly, so for her, hunters have been both rescuers and killers. She accepts them in both roles. An equal even-handedness appears in Taffy's observations about zoos. When she approaches the aviary where the Stanley cranes are kept, she imagines their saying insistently to her, "Free us." She closes her eyes and sees "acres and acres of Stanley cranes, rising in a single motion from a vast wetlands, singing out in joy and lust as they lose sight of the earth" (90-1). She tacitly acknowledges that their lives have been compromised in the zoo, but accepts what has happened by say ing to them, "You would be lost in the wild now." If her zoo confines animals, it also rescues them. Among them are Walter, a one-winged eagle, who could not have survived had he not been taken in, and of course, Buster and Gladly, who will be released. Her attitude is that in this world even well intentioned people will help, but they will also diminish the lives of wild animals. She is, however, more than a dis passionate observer, for she feels an affinity for those animals. She speaks to them as if they were pets, but she also ventriloquizes their opposing point of view by making them say, as she does with the cranes, "Free us." She does so not to humanize them or control them, but rather to remind herself of their subjective needs and of what humans have taken from them. When she speaks for them, she does n't make the cranes say, "I love you, Taffy" or "Aren't we exotic?" Instead, she has them highlight their removal from the wild. Taffy's assistant, Billings, who works on the bear project with her, also "speaks" for the bears. He gives them different voices to fit their personalities and in so doing, acknowledges them as individual sub jects. He, like Taffy with the cranes, sees animals at the zoo as more than objects for human amusement and enlightenment. His speaking for them implies that he would like the reciprocity of conversation? which, of course, he cannot have. Although the human imagining of animal speech is certainly anthropomorphic, and may be read as a bid to control the animal subject, with Taffy and Billings, it seems to be something else. Taffy is told by a friend that the practice of "channel</page><page sequence="7">South Atlantic Review 79 ing" is "just a method of communicating" where a "spirit selects someone and speaks through that person." Immediately she sees an analogy with animals. "Oh, I see," she says, and then she adds as an aside: "and I do. It's just like Buster and Gladly speaking through Billings" (94). So humans' speaking for animals, at least in this story, reveals a desire for communication and reciprocity at the same time that it tacitly acknowledges the one-sidedness of the relationship. Although Taffy's emotional relationship with Buster and Gladly is one-sided, both sides benefit from it. Taffy notes that when the Bear Restoration Project first started, she tried to avoid the "pain of anthro pomorphism" by numbering, instead of naming the cubs. In other words, she attempted scientific objectivity. But it didn't work because the cubs still came across as individuals. The following year, when Taffy names the newly arrived Buster and Gladly, this does not mean that she has abandoned her scientific side and decided that her charges are nothing more than furry humanoids. She makes clear that they are receiving the same careful scientific treatment as the numbered bears did before them. She notes pointedly that "They pay little or no atten tion to the fact that I'm here: it's a good sign. They've never taken food directly from us, never been caressed by human hands" (92). She fully understands that making pets of them would impede their reintroduc tion into the wild, but this does not stop her from according them a middle ground between pet and wild animal. Not only does she name them as she would her pets, she loves them as individuals. Upon trans ferring them to the den that has been prepared for them in the wild, she says: I'm not fooling myself that I'm helping to save the world, or the animal kingdom, or even a certain species of black bear. The project really has nothing to do with all that. It's only Buster and Gladly that I'm thinking of. (100) Without experiencing reciprocal love from the two cubs, Taffy still loves them and works in their best interests. As a scientist, she careful ly prepares the den for them, selecting an appropriately situated locale and digging out a sleeping chamber, an activity that takes several days to accomplish. She then sedates them, fits them out with radio collars, transports them, and checks their heartbeats for the last time before transferring them into their natural habitat. But as an emotionally involved human being, she also bids them farewell, as she would a pet: "This is the hardest part: scratching their</page><page sequence="8">80 j/fi/c Dwyer stubby ears for the last and only time [my italics], sniffing their bear odor, saying good-bye" (100). The combination of her scientific interest and her emotional involvement allows her to give them their best chance for survival. She is careful because she is a scientist, but she cares because she has become attached to them as individuals, even though they are not attached to her. This unrequited love is reflected in the way she recounts performing the maternal activity of digging out the den for Buster and Gladly and in the way she imagines their emergence from hibernation. She notes that when they wake up in the spring, "they'll be here without their mother" (102). She is referring primarily to their being without their ursine mother?who is dead?but second arily, to their being without herself, who has acted as a surrogate. She can't resist reflecting anthropomorphically that when they wake up, "they won't be scared, because they'll have each other, and they'll have the same old straw they went to sleep with, smelling of bear, mostly, but with just a hint of their old friend Taffy." However, she quickly edits the notion of a reciprocal relationship between herself and the bears, or even one between the two sibling bears, noting, "after a while, they'll separate, probably without so much as a farewell" (102). This interplay between the human scientist and the two orphaned cubs is both ecologically and emotionally complex. Buster and Gladly have benefited from the relationship, but their having been orphaned in the first place may well be due to the death of their mother at the hands of a hunter?we are never given the specifics. And no matter how carefully they were treated, it is impossible to know in what sub tle ways their captivity may have harmed them. Taffy's experience is also fraught?it is intellectually satisfying but emotionally difficult. Like a mother caring for an infant, she has felt love and satisfaction performing the tasks for the cubs' release. Yet, like a lover who has not been loved in return, she has felt the lack of reciprocity or, to use her term, "the pain of anthropomorphism" in the one-sided farewell. She deals with this pain by imaginatively projecting a "heaven of animals" where those who interact closely with animals are finally allowed to inhabit the same realm. Not everyone gets in, but her ani mal-loving mother, who was mistaken for a deer, does. There she is reunited with the family cocker spaniel, a dog so beloved that her name?Taffy?was passed on to a human family member, the story's narrator. There, too, are all the extinct animals like the Great Auks, whose careless over-hunting Taffy learned about as a child.</page><page sequence="9">South Atlantic Review 81 Interestingly, the sailors who unknowingly caused their extinction also inhabit this heaven?because sailors (in Taffy's generous worldview) are rescuers, too. Indeed, when Taffy as a young child inadvertently walks off the deck of a docked submarine that her physicist father has helped design, dozens of sailors jump in to save her. Taffy's imagined "other world," this "heaven of animals" that gives the story its name, is not a place that erases differences between humans and animals. Instead it seems like a kind of scientists' Eden where humans and ani mals (both companion and non-companion) retain their identities but the strife between them and the "pain of anthropomorphism" are no more. It is, as Taffy observes at the very end of the story, "the heaven I'll choose, if I get a chance" (101).3 Most animal scientists would do the same. In the 2005 Werner Herzog documentary Grimly Man Timothy Treadwell, unlike Taffy, thinks that he is able to inhabit the heaven of animals here on earth. The film, which chronicles Treadwell's thirteen summer cohabitation and finally, his death among the brown bears of Alaska's Katmai National Park, is, however, much more than a nega tive example of what can go wrong between humans and the non companion animals they study. Timothy Treadwell was neither social ly well adjusted nor trained as an animal scientist, and so his decision to bend the park's rules and live close to the bears in order to "pro tect" them was controversial on a number of levels. One can blame his instability and lack of expertise for his death, but this seems facile, given the thirteen years that the bears tolerated him as a part of their world. Less obvious, but no less important to our reception of his story is the fact that while Treadwell loved the bears and states open ly in the film that he "would die for them," the man who is telling his story, Werner Herzog, feels no affinity whatsoever for these non-com panion animals. In stark contrast to Treadwell's admiration, Herzog looks at a bear's face and coldly opines that he discovers in it "no kin ship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indif ference of nature." In the bear's "blank stare," Herzog reads only "a half-bored interest in food." Because of the disconnect between Herzog's dismissive gaze and Treadwell's loving trust, the film forces viewers to think about warring points of view that arise when humans and non-companion animals interact. Herzog's film captures the reali tv that humans interacting with non-companion animals do not always act wisely. But even more importantly, it reminds us that our judgment</page><page sequence="10">82 June Dwyer of this behavior is an intellectual overlay of our strong childhood affinity for animals that Grandin and Freud have noted. Some of us control that affinity entirely, others hardly at all. Unlike "The Heaven of Animals" that has a clear adult point of view about proper interac tion with wild animals, Grimly Man evokes in many viewers an ambiva lence about such restraint.4 Timothy Treadwell's remarkable affinity for bears, his uninhibited behavior, and his frightening death magnify the tension between the child and the adult in us. As we watch the film, we realize that his per sona does not compute with what we are used to seeing in nature doc umentaries. Rather than a competent expert like real-life primatologist Jane Goodall or the fictional Taffy, we are treated in Grimly Man to an unrestrained oddball. Goodall and Taffy don't come across as fools or social misfits. They work with the authorities rather than circumvent ing them as Treadwell does. They may be a little eccentric, but they seem serious and knowledgeable. Although like Treadwell, Goodall and Taffy are very much attached to the animals with whom they work, they never talk baby talk to them or sound as unprofessional as Treadwell does several times during the film. If we mute the sound in these scenes, he seems courageous and serious. But when we listen, he sounds like?I want to say "an old lady talking to her cats or a little kid with his puppy." But I need to amend that, because he actually sounds like most of us talking to our pets. We act like Timothy Treadwell with our domestic animals, but when we see a wildlife documentary, we have been conditioned to expect something else. We expect Jane Goodall, the eloquent and observant author of many books; we expect the reserved and thoughtful Taffy who knows Buster and Gladly need her scientific expertise more than they need her love." The childlike Treadwell throws us off balance: he is not an expert, not eloquent, and not well regarded by his peers. We find it both appeal ing and disconcerting that his best friends seem to be bears. We react this way because we have been acculturated to two differ ent kinds of animal narratives. One is the pet story?a boy and his dog, or a girl and her horse. The other is the saga of the naturalist pro fessional?Jane Goodall and her chimps, Taffy and her bears. One is the child/pet story; the other is the adult/wild animal story. Although the child in us wants to be friends with wild animals, our adult selves tell us wild animals are not meant to be pets. Timothy Treadwell con flates these two stories. More often than not, his story seems to be</page><page sequence="11">South Atlantic Review 83 about a boy and his bears, rather than an adult and his wildlife subjects. In any number of scenes in this film, Treadwell comes across as juve nile, a sort of Peter Pan of the wild. We see him talking baby talk to the bears, wanting to be their "friends," and rhapsodizing in one mem orable scene about "bear poop." Wildlife biologists examine animal excrement all the time, but Timothy Treadwell seems less like a biolo gist in this scene than an infant playing with a dirty diaper. And this, we must remind ourselves, is a man who was 46 years old the year he was killed. In his book The Grimly Ma^e: Timothy Treadwells Fatal Obsession With Alaskan Brown Bears, Nick Jans tries to make sense of Treadwell by casting him as a tragic hero and in so doing, tries to universalize his story. Jans says, What killed Timothy Treadwell wasn't a choice of campsite, lack of pepper spray, or even a bear. It was love, the intense, all-consuming passion of a tragic hero?a protagonist moti vated by noble intentions, yet somehow doomed to destroy not only himself but the things he cherished most [. . .].[!]n the process of telling Timothy Treadwell's story, we end up telling our own. (216) I would agree with Jans that we do relate to Treadwell and his story, but it is not because he is a tragic hero. A tragic hero is a man with one unfortunate flaw, while Timothy Treadwell has many flaws. Despite his bravery and love for the animals he is filming, he is immature, vain, and perhaps paranoid. And, more importantly, he seems less a man than a troubled child. There is a scene about midway through the film when it is storming and we see Treadwell in his tent with his teddy bear. Yes, he brought his teddy bear with him to Alaska every year. The observation that this is "our own story," as Jans says, or that we look at Treadwell and "see ourselves," as Herzog says at the end of his film, needs qualification. If this is a story about ourselves, it is a story about ourselves when we were children. Like Treadwell, when we were children and people were mean to us, we went away and talked to our pets. Sure enough, in the film several of Treadwell's acquaintances testify to his social prob lems, and then we see him happily off talking to the bears. Also like Treadwell, when we were children and people didn't understand us, we sulked or we shouted at them behind their backs. This, too, we see in an embarrassing rant against park officials that Treadwell taped of</page><page sequence="12">84 )une Dwyer himself and that Herzog includes in the film. And finally, like Treadwell, when we were children, if we were feeling really put upon and unhappy, we pretended we were special; we pretended we were superheroes who could do things no one else was able to do. This, too, describes Tread well's behavior, for he went to live among dangerous wild animals. Timothy Treadwell's life and his death provide us not with a tragedy, but with a third, unfamiliar kind of nature story?neither the guileless child/pet story and nor the expert adult/wild animal story, but rather an attempt for Treadwell as an adult to enter into Baker's heaven of animals. Treadwell is both a child and a man and his bears are both wild animals and pets. Literary critics have come to appreciate, indeed to look for the virtues of the third space, the borderland, the contact zone. We like to dispose of binaries, and so I think that we, in partic ular, are receptive to the possibility that Treadwell may have found a third way to be with wild animals?that he could relate to them as an animal and still help them as a human. But this was not what hap pened. His third space turned out to be not a new site of inter-species communication, but sadly, one of misunderstanding and death. The failure of Timothy Treadwell's third way becomes particularly predictable if we consider how he misread and manipulated important environmental issues to justify his behavior. In the matter of human stewardship of wild animals in their shared environment, Treadwell, not unlike the fictional Taffy, thought they needed protection. And he was certainly right; many species are threatened or endangered, and humans are daily encroaching into their habitats. His particular bears, however, were not threatened. He said he was saving them from poachers, but there was no record of poaching at Katmai and little rea son to do it, as the penalties were (and still are) very stiff. Furthermore, we are specifically told in the film that bear hunting is legal outside of the park. Another important environmental concern that Treadwell distorted was the habituation of bears to humans. In the film we see him getting angry with tourists who have come too close and are throwing objects to get the bears' attention. Too much habituation of wildlife to humans is clearly inviting mischief on both sides. This is why in "The Heaven of Animals" Taffy and her team refrain from hand feeding their soon-to-be-released bears. We can see why Treadwell was upset by the tourists' behavior: such encounters can end with a dead animal that has lost its fear of humans or a dead</page><page sequence="13">South Atlantic Review 85 human who has lost his fear of bears. However, by living in such prox imity to the same bear population for thirteen summers, Timothy Treadwell was doing the very thing he derided in others?habituating bears to humans. This irony is not lost on his detractors. As wilderness guide Joe Allen observes, "He felt he was the chosen one, and every one else was supposed to stay home and watch his videos, I guess" (Jans 68). Moreover, the Web site of Grizzly People, the organization that Treadwell and his longtime friend Jewel Palovak founded, warns people to stay "at least one hundred yards away" from bears in the wild. This from a man whom we see in his own footage swimming with bears and touching them! Treadwell maintained that it was different with him because the bears were his friends and that he loved and knew them. But no responsible environmentalist or animal scientist believes that friend ship can exist between humans and non-companion animals. Many people will grant that companion animals can be our friends: they love us; they like to be with us; they help us; they sacrifice for us. And we do the same for them. Not so with wild animals. Jane Goodall, who spent decades studying chimpanzees, called one of her early books My Friends the Chimpanzees. Now she thinks the term "friend" inaccurate. Friendship, she says, is different from what I have with the chimpanzees. Friendship is shared goals, aims, helping one another through life, depending on one another?and that's what I don't have with the chimps [. . .]. There's no way the chimps depend on me for anything. What I feel with the chimps is something rather different. It's a closeness, an awareness, an empathy with, a respect for, love of [them] [. . .]. But to me that isn't friendship. Friendship must be reciprocal. (Montgomery 124) Treadwell seems to have thought that there was reciprocity between himself and the bears: he saved them and they saved him. The second part of his assertion is probably true. His friends, relatives, and Treadwell himself all acknowledge that before he started visiting Katmai, he was a troubled individual, having abused alcohol and drugs for many years. Being out in the wild helped him gain perspective, focus, and the ability to exorcise at least some of those demons. As he says in the film: "I had no life; now I have a life." Relating to animals in the natural environment can have a very therapeutic effect on peo ple, but the animals are inadvertent therapists. The bears were indeed</page><page sequence="14">86 June Dwyer helping Timothy Treadwell, but not consciously, as friends would. Treadwell steadfastly maintained that he was helping the bears, and he may have been, although not in the way he intended and certainly not in the reciprocal way of a friendship. His spectacular footage of them has probably inspired a wide audience with the desire to continue pro tecting the Alaskan bears. And his death has inculcated an appropriate fear of their wild nature. But he was never able to acknowledge in the manner of Jane Goodall that the bears did not depend on him for any thing and that although he felt closeness, empathy, respect, and love for them, it was not reciprocated. TreadwelPs lack of objectivity with respect to the bears and his manipulation of environmental issues invites us to think about to what degree it is possible to make objective decisions with respect to wild animals in the environment. He did not even pretend to be scientific: he said repeatedly that he "loved" the bears he watched; he had favorites; he made observations without control groups; he interacted with them rather than trying to stand back and observe them. His extreme involvement and his intensely subjective behavior remind us how difficult it is to be objective. Serious scientists doing animal stud ies in the wild do not behave like Timothy Treadwell, but neither are they ever totally objective. Like Alison Baker's fictional protagonist, most zoologists start out simply observing, but the best of them? Jane Goodall, Frans de Waal, Barbara Smuts, Robert Sapolsky?end up naming the animals they spend so much time with and admit to having favorites. This is not a bad thing. It is evidence that we are a part of what we are studying?whether we be in a lab, a zoo, or in the field, whether we are scientists or simply vacationers out in the wild. It is important that we acknowledge our affinities, even as we try to make useful scientific discoveries and moral choices. We're not making decisions about something we are in charge of; we are making decisions about things we are a part of. But to say we humans are a part of our environment and share affinities with other living things is not the same thing as saying we are all the same or even basically the same. This seems like such an obvious statement to make, but as both Taffy and Treadwell demonstrate, it is very difficult to grant wild creatures their otherness, their own partic ularity. We tend to understand through affinity. With adults observing animals, this usually translates into anthropomorphism?the attribu tion of human traits to animals. With children it is the reverse?</page><page sequence="15">South Atlantic Review 87 zoomorphism, or the assumption of animal traits by humans. Treadwell indulged in both and in so doing, over-estimated the affini ty between himself and the non-companion animals he chose to live with. More than one person in the film observes that Treadwell assumed there was a very porous boundary between himself and the bears. Wildlife biologist Larry Van Daele says, "He wanted to become a bear." Sam Haakanson, curator of the Aleutic Museum says, "He tried to be a bear." TreadwelPs friend, ecologist Mamie Gaede, says, "He wanted to mutate into a wild animal," and helicopter pilot Sam Egli says that he acted like "he was working with people wearing bear costumes." Even Treadwell himself says at one point, "I am one of them." TreadwelPs attitude brings us back to Temple Grandin's theory about the correspondence between children's incomplete intellectual development and their affinity for animals. Although Timothy Treadwell was between the ages of 33 and 46 when he lived with the Katmai bears, he retained the relatively uncomplicated sensibility of a child. As Larry Van Daele observed to Nick Jans, "There's so much more to a bear than Treadwell ever understood. [There's] so much more than this I-love-you, you're-my-friend, I'll-protect-you stuff. They're in a higher realm" (57). In essence, Van Daele was saying that TreadwelPs relationship with the bears lacked an intellectual compo nent, that his knowledge had never progressed beyond the emotional. He was not specifically suggesting that Treadwell had to steep himself in animal science. There are several other ways to gain intellectual per spective about human/animal relationships. Martha Nussbaum has done so by inquiring into animal rights; Randy Malamud has taken another path by investigating the way that cultural expressions about animals help us to understand and respect them.6 There is no one pre scribed intellectual path that Treadwell should have followed, but he did need the distance that intellectual inquiry brings, and that is some thing he never cultivated. By identifying so closely with the bears, Timothy Treadwell oversimplified their nature; he lacked the sense of their complex otherness that intellectual inquiry would have taught him. As a result, he was not able to accept that his intense love of the Katmai bears was unrequited and that they lived, as Van Daele put it, "in another realm." Pulling back and looking at these two bear stories as cases to illus trate my non-companion animal manifesto, we see that in "The</page><page sequence="16">88 June Payer Heaven of Animals" Taffy recognizes her desire to have with Buster and Gladly the "cross-species sociality" and "happiness together" that can be achieved with companion animals. But she indulges in it only in her imagination. She imagines the bears might remember her as they emerge from hibernation and she imagines she might see them again in the heaven of animals. She does not act on her desire for reciproc ity in any way that will compromise the bears' chances for survival. What she calls the pain of anthropomorphism (and I have called unre quited love) is something that she deals with and even appreciates, because it has allowed her a degree of emotional closeness to the bears. While Taffy's story appeals to us intellectually, TreadwelPs hits us more viscerally, dredging up our uninhibited childhood desires to be friends with animals. We understand why Timothy Treadwell is killed and can lay out any number of reasons pointing to its inevitability, yet part of us wishes that he had succeeded. We don't wish him well because he is an appealing character, because he is not. We wish him well because we want what he wants: we want wild animals both to like us and to be like us. Alas, we don't get everything we want?and so we, too, feel the pain of anthropomorphism. The realization that we don't get everything we want is part of our growing up to become respon sible members of society; feeling the pain of anthropomorphism is part of our growing up to become responsible members of the natu ral world. Notes 1 See Animals in Translation, 52-57. 2 My assessment of our relationship to our pets is more generous than Yi-Fu Tuan's in his classic 1984 study Dominance and Affection: The Making of Pets. 3 Although Baker's short story shares the same title as James Dickey's poem "The Heaven of Animals," she never alludes to it, and her particular concept of such a heaven is quite different from his. 4 By way of example I would cite lively arguments generated among members of the Honors Enrichment Program at my home institution when the film was aired. 5 My statement is a simplification (but I think a valid one) of howT expertise is per ceived in contemporary wildlife documentaries. For an excellent in-depth treatment of the genre, see Gregg Mitman's 1999 study Keel Nature: Americas Romance with Wildlife on Film. 6 I cite Nussbaum's Frontiers of justice and Malamud's Poetic Animals and Animal Souls as examples of the growing number of important philosophical and literary inquiries into the human/animal relationship.
