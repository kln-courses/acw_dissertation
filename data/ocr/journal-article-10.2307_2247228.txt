[These Notes (by variou6s hands) do not exclude Critical Notices later on.] O)n the History of, the Process by which the Aristotelian Writings arrived at their Present Form. An Essay by RICHARD -SHUTE, late Student and Tutor of Christ Church. With a brief Memoir of the Author. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1888. Pp. xv., 183. In MIND ii. 392, Shute's early work, A Discourse on Truth; received the attention due to its great freshness, at least, of style; and when, after a few years of remarkable influence as an Oxford teacher, he sank prematurely into the grave, Mr. J. A. Stewart, in xii. 157, gave expres- sion to the sense left with his sorrowing friends of what he had been, even more than of what he had done or was on the way to do. For himself, as is told in the excellent little memoir (by II F. Y. P. ") prefixed to the present volume, he could meet his fate with the dying words (to a friend) now inscribed by his wife on his tomb: " I think that man is happiest who is taken while his hand is still warm on the plough, wlho has not lived long enough to feel his strength failing him or his work every day worse done ". The volume gives an essay he wrote for the Conington Prize Competition in 1882. He was never able to re-write it in the light of his later studies in Aristotle, and it is now published on the responsibility of the friends who were left to dispose of his papers. It is an attempt in a field that has been well worked over in Germany, but Shute displays so much independence of judgment in relation to his foreign predecessors that his friends' decision to lay the results of his survey before English readers is much to be approved. What con- clusions he was led to can best be given in words selected from his own summary at p. 176: (1) " Of the great bulk of the Aristotelian works as we now have them, there was no kind of publication during the lifetime of the master, nor probably for a considerable period after his death ". (2) " We cannot assert with certainty that we have ever got throughout a treatise in the exact words of Aristotle, though we may be pretty clear that we have a fair representation of his thought; the unity of style observable may belong quite as well to the school as to the individual." (3) " The works which are preserved to us come chiefly, if not entirely, from the tradition of Andronicus, and stand in no very definite relation to the list of Diogenes, and consequently we have a very considerable proportion, not a merely insignificant fraction, of the reputed works of Aristotle krrown to Latin antiquity." (4) " The majority of the titles and probably all the definite references are post-Aristotelian, and therefore no safe argument can be drawn from the latter as to the authenticity or- original order of the Aristotelian works, though other very valuable inferences as to the subsequent history of these works result from their careful consideration." (5) As to " another class of works which bear Aristotle's name-of which we can say with certainty that the portions which we have of them are precisely as the final author wrote them but cannot with equal certainty assert that that author was Aristotle- -we can safely assume that these works, and works like these, were those best known to our earliest authorities on the subject, Cicero and his predecessors, and that on them all the praise of Aristotle's style is founded ". " Criticism of Aristotle," it is finally declared, should " always be of thought rather than of phrase, of sentence rather than of word ".</page><page sequence="2">608 NEW BOOKS. English Composition and Rhetoric. Enlarged Edition. Part Second. "Emotional Qualities of Style." By ALEXANDER BAIN, LL.D., Emeritus Professor of Logio in the University of Aberdeen. Lon- don:'Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1888. Pp. xxxii., 325. This volume, coming after the other on "Intellectual Elements of Style " issued last year (see MIND xii. 298), completes the transforma- tion and development of the author's well-known Rhetoric of 1866. Part ii. is essentially, or rather in nearly every respect, a new book. Only in some minor matters is anything to be found common to the new and the old exposition. The former ten-page account of " Strength" disappears in a six-fold longer tracking of the quality through all its kinds and manifestations. " Feeling," taken for purposes of Rhetoric as equivalent to Tenderness or the amiable side of human nature, is in like manner analysed and illustrated through more than 100 pp., where half- a-dozen were given before; and the novel expansion given to the topics "1 Vituperation " and " The Ludicrous " is only less. There is now also supplied at the beginning a classification of Art-emotions, followed by an elaborate consideration (pp. 11-54) of the rhetoKical " Aids to Emotional Qualities ". The volume, as it now stands, is of no small interest to the psychologist as a practical-or rather (borrowing a word from German usage) ' pragmatic '-ssupplement to that theory of the Emotions which has long been one of the author's chief titles to fame. Even in point of theory the careful reader will here meet with new lights; while he can- not but be drawn on by the author's characteristic determination to find the analytic expression of everything that can be analysed in literary effect. Nor is the result the less instructive and useful for guidance, however it may be contended that the best literary work, at least of the creative sort, has always something in it of which analysis can never hope to find the formula. Francis Bacon: His Life and Philosophy. By JOHN NICHOL, M.A., LL.D., Professor of English Literature in the University of Glasgow. Part i. Bacon's Life. (" Philosophical Classics for English Readers.") Edinburgh and London: W. Blackwood &amp; Sons, 1888. Pp. x., 212. This is the thirteenth volume issued of the " Philosophical Classics " series. Like its immediate predecessor, Principal Caird's Spinoza (re- viewed above, in the present No.), it departs, but departs in a different way, from the rule of the series. Of Spinoza no life was given, and even his philosophy was examined rather than expounded. The present volume is all Life, and we have to wait for another to get Prof. Nichol's account of Bacon as a philosopher. It is difficult to say which form of departure from,,the rule of the series is least to be approved. There was certainly no more occasion for the licence in the case of Spinoza or Bacon than in the case of some half-dozen of the other great thinkers already treated in the series. A great deal can, of course, be said on the debata'ble events of Bacon's life, and on his personal character, and it is said by Prof. Nichol with plenty of literary effect; but even if, in the sum :of it all, much could be called new, one does not see how thereby the -understanding of his philosophy is helped forward. For this series, -therefore, there was no great need to enlarge on Bacon's life, and Prof. Nichol might have done very well with a single volume. If the series is confinued beyond Bacon, as sometimes has been promised in a general way and certainly is much to be desired, let us hope that the editor will enforce again the rule of the one volume fairly balanced, according to the circunmstances of each case, between Life and Philosophy. Meanwhile, as regards Bacon and Prof. Nichol, we can but wait, in MIND,.for the coming Part ii.</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 609 Scientific Religiorn or Higher Possibilities of Life and Practice through the Operation of lVatural Forces. By LAURENCE OLIPHANT. With an Appendix by a Clergyman of the Church of England. Edinburgh and London: W. Blackwood &amp; Sons, 1888. Pp. xiii., 473. It is no more possible with this book than with its predecessor Synm- pneumata (see MIND x. 301) to attempt even the most general analysis of contents. That, we are told, was written down by Mr. Oliphant from the dictation of his late wife, he being mere passive instrument in the case; this has come forth from hinmself, but still in a manner of which he can give no further account than that it has been written under an irresistible impulse, that would take effect only in the particular room of his Syrian home whence the spirit of his wife had passed into the unseen. In the first half of the book, the religion of which he has thus become the channel of revelation to the world has its "scientific" character set forth and vindicated, in relation with certain results of recent inquiry and in contrast to the baseless dogmatism of prevailing religious systems. The second half consists in great part of an exegesis of Scripture (carried out with minuter detail by another hand in the appendix), showing the hidden truth enshrined there which has all the time been missed or perverted by the Christian Churches of every name. The "higher possibilities of life and practice " now in view de- pend upon the victory to be gained by the " Divine Feminine" over the "infernal feminine." which has hitherto held sway in our world since the Fall and had already before caused nothing less than a world- catastrophe. In other words, the true position of woman as the proper complement of man (each particular woman, in the seen or unseen, the complement of some particular man), is in process of becoming finally asserted; and hereby the salvation of the world will be wrought. There is a curious, affinity-apparently quite unknown to Mr. Oliphant--- between his own views and those adumbrated by Comte at the end of the Politique Positive; though their methods of deduction or other argumentative support are as widely different as could be. Proceedings of the Society of Psychical Research. Part xii. London: Triibner &amp; Co., 1888. Pp. 270. The longest of four main papers in this latest Part of these Pro- ceedinigs is a very elaborate (150 pp.) " Relation de diverses experiences sur la transmission mentale, la lucidite et autres phenomenes non explicables par les donnees scientifiques actuelles," by M. Charles Richet, Professor of Physiology in the Paris Faculty of Medicine, and editor of thae Revue Scientifique. It gives, with the help of many figured illustrations, the results of an experimental inquiry carried on for six years, pointing in the author's opinion to, though (he must add) not yet demonstrating with certainty, " the existence in certain persons at cer- tain moments of a faculty of [objective] knowledge which has no relation with our normal faculties ". He would call this faculty "Lucidity" (without implying that it has a relation to retinal vision more than to any *other sense), and thinAs that all the phenomena of so-called thought- transference, &amp;c., may be brought under it. New "Experiments in Thought-transference,' by A. Schmoll and J. E. Mabire, occupy 46 pp. of the Part. The other chief papers are from the hand, now for ever still, that has always been most active in the work of the Society since it began to be. One is but a reprint, slightly modified and now entitled " Hypnotism and Telepathy," of the two articles contributed by Gurney to MIND xii. 212, 397, under the name " Further Problems of Hypnotism ".</page><page sequence="4">610 NEW BOOKS. The other (pp. 3-17) records what appears to have been his latest series of "Experiments in Hypnotism," yielding further striking results as to an "intelligent automatism " active in the post-hypnotic state, which the previous series had first disclosed, and as to production of anaesthesia by proximity of the operator's hand, which had been observed a good deal earlier. Evolution and its Relation to Religious Thought. By JOSEPH LE CONTE, Professor of Geology and Natural History in the University of California. London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1888. Pp. xviii., 344. In the first two parts of this book (i. "What is EvolutiQn ? " ii. "Evidences of the Truth of Evolution ") the author gives an exposition of the doctrine of evolution generally, with more special reference to biological evolution. In part iii. (" The Relation of Evolution to Religious Thought," pp. 257-338) he seeks to show the consistency of the evolution-theory in its widest sense with "fundamental religious beliefs ". The first two parts are not only a good exposition of the theory as now held, including its latest developments, but have some distinctive points that claim the attention of biologists. In a chapter on " The Relation of Louis Agassiz to the Theory of Evolution " (pt. i., ch. ii., pp. 32-49), the author contends that "without Agassiz (or his equivalent), there would have been no Darwin "' ; that the great American naturalist "laid the whole foundation of evolution, solid and broad," though he "refused to build any scientific structure on it". Without the establishment of certain " laws of geologic succession - formulated by the author as (a) the law of differentiation, (b) the law of progress of the whole, (c) the law of cyclical movement--no inductive proof of the Darwinian theory would have been possible, and for the knowledge of these laws " we are mainly indebted to Agassiz ". These laws are, of course, no longer to be understood as merely formal laws, but as laws of the actual process of evolution. One of the distinctive points of the author's view is " that the steps of evolution are not always uniform " (p. 239). "JCauses or forces are constant, but phenomena everywhere and in every department of Nature are paroxqysmal." That the transitions between species are in a manner catastrophic, being brought on by rapidly changing conditions, and thus extend over much shorter periods of time than the persistence of species in fixed forms adapted to uniform conditions, serves in part to explain the rarity of transitional forms in the geological record. What - seems to be the comparative fixity of forms in recent times is explained by the tendency of specialisation to arrest successively the advance along particular lines. "Thus, throughout the whole geological history of the earth, the larger number of forms, by specialisation, become rigid and perish, while the fewer, more generalised and more plastic forms take up the march and carry it forward a step, only to be themselves specialised and fixed. . . . Now, obviously, this specialisation and respecialisation can not go on for ever." The advent of man is " in many ways a sign of the completeness of organic evolution ". With man, evolution has been transferred " from the organic to the social plane, from the material to the psychical," and it seems as if, "when the cycle of human evolution culminates," " organic forms will no longer be modi- fied by natural but wholly by artificial selection" (pp. 250-1). The doctrine of evolution is brought into harmony with the requirements of religious thought by the view that "the phenomena of Nature are naught else than objectified modes of divine thought, the forces of Nature naught else than different 'forms of one omnipresent divine</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 611 energy or will, the laws of Natu-re naught else than the regular modes of operation of that divine will, invariable because He is unchangeable" (p. 283). In accordance with his biological theory of "paroxysmal" transitions from one form of life to another, the author holds that " there is a sort of taxonomic scale of force and matter. There are-- (1) the plane of elements; (2) the plane of chemical compounds; (3) the plane of vegetal life; (4) the plane of animal life , and (5) the plane of rational and, as we hope, immortal life" (p. 296). "Although energy by transmutation may take all these different forms, and thus does now circulate up and down through all these planes, -yet the passage fron one plane upward to another is not a gradual passage by sliding scale, but at one bound. When the necessary conditions are present, a new and higher form of force at once appears, like a birth into A higher sphere." The upward movement of energy is one of increasing " individuation ". "According to this view, the vital principle of plants and the anima of animals are but different stages of the develop- ment of spirit in the womb of Nature: in man at last it came to birth" (p. 300). Nature is all mechanics from the outside, all mind from the inside. " For science it is all mechanics, for theology it is all mind. It is the duty of philosophy to reconcile these two opposite views" (p. 317). " This reconciliation, as far as it is possible for us, is found in a personal will immanent in Nature, and determining directly all its phenomena " (p. 321). " Immanence without pantheism, and per- sonality without anthropomorphism," is the phrase in which the author sums up this view. The Philosophy of Religion on the Basis of its History. By Dr. OTTO PFLEIDERER, Professor in the University of Berlin. Vol. iii., translated by ALLAN MENZIES, B.D. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1888. Pp. viii., 356. Referring to MIND x. 285 for Critical Notice of the German original and to xi. 587, xii. 616, for mention of former parts of the English translation, we now note the appearance of the present volume giving the first half of the second main division of the work-" Genetic-speculative Philo- sophy of Religion ". The other half of the division, completing the work, is already in the press and will appear shortly. The translator has, with the author's permission, added a few notes on some works bearing on mythology and early religions which have appeared since the date of the last German edition. Memory, its Logical Relations and Cultivation. By F. W. EDRIDGE- GREENt, M.B., B.S. (Durham); Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (Eng.); Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (Lond.). London: Bailliere, Tindall &amp; Cox, 1888. Pp. iv., 274. The author's doctrine of memory forms part of a physiological andi psychological doctrine that has much in common with phrenology, although the special assumptions of phrenologists are rejected (pp. 35-9). " The mind," in his view, "is made up of a number of faculties, each of which responds to certain impressions, and influences the mind as a whole to seek after those impressions and to avoid their negatives" (p. 48). The brain is "a multiple organ," and each of its parts is the seat of a mental faculty. A classification of " the faculties of the mind," chiefly drawn from phrenology, is given on pp. 66-7. Memory, according to the theory developed, is " a definite faculty, and has its seat in the basal ganglion of 'the brain, separate from, but associated</page><page sequence="6">612 NEW BOOKS. with, all the other faculties of the mind " (p. 3). The optic thalami and the corpora striata are "the seats of sensory and motor memory, respectively " (p. 205). Arguing from cases where there has been " loss of memory of impressions received within a certain period of time " unaccompanied by " loss of function of any of the faculties," the author concludes that " the theory that the memory occupies the same portion of brain as the perception is not tenable " (pp. 47-48). Part i. (pp. 1-217) contains the theory and many illustrative anecdotes. Part ii. (pp. 218-271) gives rules for the cultivation of the memory, " sensory" and " motor ". Leibniz's New Essays concerning the Human Understanding. A Critical Exposition by JOHN DEWEY, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Philo- sophy in the University of Michigan, Professor (Elect) of Mental and Moral Philosophy in the University of Minnesota. (" Griggs's Philosophical Classics," No. 7.) Chicago: S. C. Griggs &amp; C6o. 1888. Pp. xvii., 272. No piece of work was more wanted or was better worth doing for this useful series (as to the aims and compass of which see MIND No. 51, p. 432) than that which Prof. Dewey has here executed; and, considering his subject, he has shown nothing but good juidgment in treating it with a freedom of method, in respect of sidelong view, not adopted by writers of the previous volumes. It is hardly possible, or would be useless if possible, to give a simply " critical exposition " of the Nouveaux Essais by the side of the other " masterpieces of German thought " which the series covers; yet there is no other which it more, or in a way even so much, should interest the English student to understand. In explaining the famous controversial treatise, Prof. Dewey has to keep his eye at once on Locke, against whom it is directed, and on the manifold occa- si6nal (none of them systematic) expositions of Leibniz's characteristic ideas, which are all through implied but seldom expressly declared in the Nouveaux Esscais. The result is that he manages to make of the volume a very welcome guide to the comprehension of Leibniz generally -welcome because affording a most useful supplement, as regards the main conceptions of his philosophy, to the account (excellent as that- in many respects was) given by Dr. Theodore Merz in the volume contri- buted some years ago (see MIND ix. 316) to " Blackwood's Philosophical Classics". We may return to Prof. Dewey's exposition in fulfilling- it is hoped before long-a half-promise made in No. 50, p. 312, to give some detailed account of the important new material for the understanding of Leibniz's relations to Locke latelv brought forward by C. J. Gerhardt. Of this material Prof. Dewey does not seem to have had the opportunity of making use. The Aryan Race, its Origin and its Achievemaents. By CHARLES MORRIS. Chicago: S. C. Griggs &amp; Co., 1888. Pp. vi., 347. The author has very well succeeded in his purpose of giving a brief outline of the history of the Aryan race as ascertained by philologists and anthropologists. The narrative is characterised by directness of movement and grasp of the subject as a whole. His speculations about the primitive home of the Aryans and about the origin of the Aryan race have some originality. There are interesting remarks (see,, for example, p. 296) on the possible influence of climate and physical surroundings in the production of racial types. The short chapter (ch. ix., pp. 215-242) on " The Age of Philosophy" deals more with the preparation in mythology for philosophical speculation than-with philo sophy itself; but this is in accordance with the general plan of the boqk.</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 613 De la Classification des Sciences. Etude logique par ADRIEN NAVILLE, Professeur A, l'Academie de Neuchatel. (Extrait de la Critique philosophique.) Geneve-Bale: H. Georg, 1888. Pp. 46. The author divides the sciences into three groups: " (1) The sciences of the real or sciences of beings. History. (2) The sciences of the neces- sary conditions of the possible or sciences of laws. Theorematic. (3) The sciences of the ideal or of the rules of activity. Regulative sciences." A scientific law, as established in the theorematic sciences, affirms that given such and such a term, another term necessarily follows. The effective sequence of a particular term is established when it is known by historical science that such and such a term was present in the beginning. Thus "historical laws," whether laws of physical develop- ment or of human history, are properly speaking not scientific laws but " general facts "; and their explanation depends on two factors-(1) laws of nature, (2) a certain collocation, among many possible ones, of determinate elements. By supposing a different original collocation of elements therefore, we can, without absurdity, "represent to ourselves in the past a history different from real history ". As the real is a part (and only a part) of the possible, so also is the ideal. Being a different part, it is the object of a separate science. " The science of the ideal is the exposition of those rules of which the practice would assure the realisation of the best that is possible." If these rules could be adequately formulated, all persons would be obliged to accept them theoretically, though the practice of them would still be free. The problem of the particular " sciences of the ideal " is to determine the best ends, and, with the aid of the historical sciences and the sciences of laws, to select those ends that are realisable and to show how they can be realised. The " sciences of the ideal " or " regulative sciences " are divided into (1) " sciences regulative of invention," and (2) " sciences regulative of knowledge ". The first group includes the " theory of good ends and of their hierarchy" (morals), and the "theory of means or theory of arts ". The "arts" are divided into (a) those that aim at producing an immediate satisfaction (aesthetics, theory of play), (b) those that aim at the production of utility (theories of industry, iriedicine, eloquence, education, politics, &amp;c.). Logic, " the science regulative of knowledge " or "of other sciences," is also included in the classification as a " science of the ideal," because "if (theoretical) science does not transform the object that it studies, it at least transforms the mind itself. Science, like art, has for aim and for result an amelioration of realit,y; the reality that is ameliorated is here the intelligence." (La Psychologie de l'Enfant.) L'Art et la Podsie chez l'Enfant. Par BERNARD PEREZ. Paris: F. Alcan, 1888. Pp. vii., 308. Some remarks in the second edition of M. Perez's L'Education Morale des le Berceau (MIND xiii. 301) may have led his readers to hope that he would treat separately the subject of the aesthetic sense in children. This he has now done in the present volume, which, like his former works, is at the same time a study in the psychology of childhood and a practical treatise on education. The titles of its chapters are :-i. " Le gouht de la parure"; ii. "Le sentiment de la nature"; iii. "Le senti- ment de la nature (suite): la grace et le sublime: les fleurs, les vallees, les montagnes, la mer "; iv. " L'art de plaire: politesse, babil, coquet- terie"; v. " La musique"; vi. " Le dessin "; vii. " La tendance drama- tique"; viii. "La lecture"; ix. "La composition litteraire ". These titles by themselves give an idea of the varied psychological interest</page><page sequence="8">614 NEW BOOKS. characteristic of this as of the author's former studies of childhood. A few points of theoretical interest may first be selected for mention. M. Perez notices, as other observers have done, that children pay attention only to the salient features of landscape (pp. 78-9) and that they are not spontaneously "animists" (pp. 45-6). That which is absolutely constant in nature, he finds, does not at first become the object of their aesthetic emotions. Novelty is required to arouse aesthetic interest; and in the case of the heavenly bodies this interest is aroused by changes of position (p. 42). " Language and vocal music are in the beginning one and the same thing, the expression of less determinate feelings." It is only towards the age of four that the separation between the speaking and the singing voice is completely effected (pp. 148-9). In the reproduction of sounds, motor images and excitations play the chief part (p. 152). In the recognition of objects and in the first attempts at drawing, form and not colour is the essential thing (pp. 179, 205). A position on which M. Perez much insists is that "the most important factor of the aesthetic feeling is sympathy.... Hl-uman interest, that is the root and the crown of observation " (p. 59). The feelings aroused by external nature and, still more, by music, are not at first the strictly aesthetic feelings, but a vague emotional excite- ment. This, M. Perez thinks, has its dangers; and as a means of preventing over-excitation of the sensibilities, he suggests training of the intellectual element in the appreciation of art. To teach children music, instead of merely letting them hear it, for example, fulfils this purpose. M. Perez frequently returns to the question whether im- portant intellectual differences between the sexes are observable in children, and is inclined to answer in the negative. His practical con- clusion here is-" Give the two sexes the same education, an education of. liberty, of good sense and of measure, and each of them will profit by it in its own manner" (p. 135). His tendency in detail, however, is towards more minute supervision than seems altogether consistent with this precept. The condemnation of dolls and fairy tales, remarked on by Mr. Pollock in his review of the first edition of L'Education Morale 4es le Berceau (MIND vi. 281) does not reappear, but the suggestion that it is desirable to moralise Punch and Judy (p. 225) betrays the same tendency to over-regulation. Less attention is devoted to the begin- nings of the literary sense in children than to the beginnings of the feeling for natural beauty and for music. In the chapter on reading we miss the varied psychological observations that give so much interest to the earlier part of the book; and it is here especially that the tendency to excessive regulation is noticeable. Two sentences may be quoted in illustration. "4 Ainsi les lectures des enfants sont toutes controlees, discutees, expliquees, indirectement r4gl4es" (p. 265). "Heureux les enfants dont les lectures sont surveillees, partagees, contr6lees! " (p. 307). Yet, while he would check the unprompted reading of children, M. Perez is all for making literary education less severe. He would teach historical facts, for example, by a kind of dramatic games. He also proposes a method of " forming the young writer " by setting him to write compositions on himself and his own occupations and thoughts instead of on the customary subjects for rhetorical exercises. The art of literary composition, he thinks, might thus be learnt by .childTren "en se jouant ". To all this exception may be taken on several grounds, but especially on these two. First, according to what M. Perez has said with reference to music, is, not the proper way of obviating the dangers that lurk in indiscriminate reading-unfavour- able, as he considers it, to " reason and abstract judgments "-to give</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 615 apart from it a sufficient amount of not too easy intellectual discipline? Secondly, is minutely supervised and regulated play real play ? Les Principes du Droit. Par EMILE BEAUSSIRE, Membre de l'Institut. Paris: F. Alcan, 1888. Pp. vi., 427. To this work the author's Principes de la Morale, reviewed in MIND xi. 272, is introductory. The idea of " right," he holds, must be based on the idea of duty; and this idea the theory of law has to take, without further investigation on its own account, from ethics. "Le devoir sert de base au droit cornme l'espace A, la geometrie. Le droit laisse A la morale le soin de remonter au delA? du devoir, comme la geometrie laisse A la metaphysique le soin de remonter au delA de l'espace.?' The volume is divided into an Introduction (pp. 1-31) and three Books: i. " Theorie gdndrale du Droit " (pp. 33-69), ii. " Droit public " (pp. 72-199), iii. " Droit priv " (pp. 202-420). In his Introduction the author seeks to maintain the conceptions of "state of nature," " social contract" and "natural rights," in senses defined by him. The " state of nature," in his view, is not a primitive state that preceded society, but a state that h1ways persists side by side with the " legal state ". It includes all those rela- tions of men to one another and to that which is outside them that do not come under political control. Similarly, the " social contract" is not an agreement deliberately entered into when first the legal state was substituted for the state of nature, but is a tacit contract implied in the constitution of every society. The conception of "natural right" is required to give positive law its "legitimacy," as positive law is re- quired to give natural right its " indispensable guarantees ". The mu- tual relations between politics and natural right are thus defined. " Le droit naturel n'embrasse pas la politique, et il n'est pas embrasse par elle. Le premier devoir de la politique est de respecter le droit naturel, et l'un des objets principaux du droit naturel est de juger la politique, de I'approuver ou de la fl6trir suivant qu'elle est juste ou injuste." The general principle which the author makes the foundation of his philo- sophy of law is that right is "the guarantee of duty2". "The rights of man " " embrace all that each man needs to do or to possess in order to accomplish freely the moral law " (p. 46). " Life and liberty are logi- cally the first of rights, since they are the first and the most constant condition of the accomplishment of duty " (p. 390). M. Beaussire, starting from divisions made by. Grotius and Reid, divides rights into rights to " respect" and to " assistance ". " So long as a man can by himself fulfil all his duties, he has only the right to fulfil them in peace (i.e., to be respected in the fulfilment of them); but so soon as he cannot entirely suffice to himself, assistance is due to him, not for the sake of him personally, but for the sake of the law which governs him and of which all men are the subjects and ministers " (p. 53). Esquisse d'une Philosophie de 1'.9tre. Par J. E. ALAUX, Professeur de faculte, Professeur de philosophie a l1-cole des lettres d'Alger. Paris: F. Alcan, 1888. Pp. 105. The author here presents a summary of a philosophical system which he hopes to develop at some futuLre time. In its present form, he says, " c'est l'esquisse d'une tentative de renouveler la theodic6e, qui, sta- tionnaire, ce semble, depuis Leibniz, ou ne se developpant que dans le sens du pantheisme, laisse tomber ceux que ne satisfait pas un insuf- fisant optimisrae dans un pessimisme d'autant plus redoutable que la logique ne permet point de choix 'entre la foi en Dieu et le desespoir ".</page><page sequence="10">616 NEW BOOKS. The relation of the author's doctrine to that of Leibniz is explained on pp. 82-4. His system is a -monadism, according to which " each sub- stance is the cause of the phenomena that reveal its own being, in virtue of the being that is in it, and under the excitation of other beings ". The " law of being " at which he arrives is summed up thus: " Tout possible est une puissance propre, qui tend A l'etre; tout rdel est un conscient resultant d'une synthese de deux termes contraires et identiques, un moi et un non-moi qui, suscites par Dieu et se suscitant l'un l'autre, se font, sous cette action du suscitateur supreme, exister l'un l'autre, de degre en degr4, de realite en realite, d'8tre en etre, jusqu'i la perfection de l'etre, jusqu'A, l'universelle communaute de vie en Dieu ". La Morale de Socrate. Par Mme. JULEs FAvRE (nde VELTEN). Paris: F. Alcan, 1888. Pp. iii., 328. This is a companion volume to La Morale des Stolciens, noticed in MIND xiii. 136. Translated passages from the Memorabilia and from Plato are arranged according to the general plan of the author's former volume; each group of extracts having for introduction a sketch of the teaching of Socrates on the particular point. The book is in two parts: i. " God-Duties towards God " (pp. 5-40), ii. " The Soul -Duties towards the Soul " (pp. 41-323). Socrates is viewed as the precursor of Christian morality. Critique de la Raison Pratique. Par EMMANUEL KANT. Nouvelle Tra- duction franqaise avec un Avant-Propos sur la Philosophie de Kant en France de 1773 A 1814, des Notes philologiques et philosophiques, par F. PICAVET, AgreWg de philosophie. Paris: F. Alcan, 1888. Pp. xxxvii., 326. M. Picavet's edition, with preface, of Condillac's TraitJ des Sensations, was mentioned in MIND xi. 303. He here puts forth a translation of the Kritik d. practischen Vernunft, executed with characteristic care, and prefaced by a very interesting account of the appreciation that Kant had found in France before the time when, according to the usual statement, Kantian studies first begin. He shows that Kant's works were common subjects of discussion among French students of philo- sophy during the whole period treated of ; that, from the appearance of the Kritik d. reinen Vernunft, its importance was recognised in France as in Germany; that, during the Revolutionary period, it was the usual remark of those Frenchmen who occupied themselves with Kant, that the Kritik was making a revolution in philosophy not less far-reaching than the contemporary political revolution; and that, when the exposi- tion of Kant's philosophy by Villers appeared in 1801, protests justi- fiably made themselves heard on all sides against his assumption that French philosophers had neglected Kant. Thus, instead of coming at the beginning of the period of French occupation with Kant, Mine. de Stael, " the most illustrious of the writers who admired Kant or caused him to be admired," comes at the end of a period duLring which his doctrines had been repeatedly expounded and discussed. M. Picavet brings his sketch to a close with 1814, the history of Kantianism in France from that time being well known. After a page of final sum- mary, he concludes with these sentences. " Nous nous demandons si l'on pourrait, vingt ans apres l'apparition des ceuvres capitales d'un Comte, d'un Spencer, d'un Darwin, trouver en Allemagne autant d'homnies celebres A des titres si divers, qui aient tente de les com-</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 617 prendre, autant de travaux importants qui aient eu pour but de faire connaitre, d'apprecier les doctrines nouvelles, de mettre meme en relief la valeur du penseur dont les conclusions auraient ete combattues comme inexactes. Et cependant les contemporains de ces trois penseurs n'ont pas ete m81es A des 6v6nements aussi terribles et aussi peu propices a la speculation que ceux dont ont ete temoins les homnes qui vecurent de 1789 A 1814 " (p. xxxvi.). To the translation are appended some valuable " Philosophical Notes " (pp. 297-323). Etudes de Psychologie expd'rimentale. Par ALFRED BINET. Paris: Octave Doin, 1888. Pp. 307. Four studies by one of the most active and effective of French in- vestigators: (1) " Le F6tichisme dans l'Amour (pp. 1-85); (2) " La Vie psychique des Micro-organismes (pp. 87-237); (3) "^L'Intensite des Images mentales" (pp. 239-77); (4) "Le Probl6me hypnotique" (pp. 279-98) ; followed by a "Note sur l'Ecriture hysterique" (pp. 299-306). The third and fourth are of special value in relation to questions which the author himself has done as much as any man to invest with their present interest. The second is a very elaborate and careful study in a new field. In the first, certain morbid forms of erotic passion are brought under psychological law. L'Hypnotisme et la Liberte des ReprJsentations publiques. Lettres A M. le Professeur Thiriar, Representant, Suivies de l'examen du Rapport presentd par M. Masoin A l'Academie de Medecine. Par J. DEL- BOEUF, Professeur A l'Universite de Liege, &amp;c. Liege: Ch. Aug. Desoer, 1888. Pp. 111. In these "Letterg " Prof. Delboeuf utters a protest against the attempt that is being made in Belgium and other parts of Europe to suppress public representations of hypnotic phenomena. He contends both that the dangers of hypnotism have been exaggerated, and that the best means of guarding against those that really exist is publicity. Against the school of the Salp8triere h'e maintains the position, defended by him on other occasions, that hypnotism is in no way connected with neurotic diseases. The phenomenon with which it can best be com- pared is ordinary sleep; and perfectly healthy subjects are often much easier to hypnotise than hysterical subjects. Ilypnotic ' suggestion ' is by no means all-powerful; and memory of what has passed in the hypnotic state "can be perfectly revived". That the practice of hypno- tism should be legaJly restricted, as has been proposed, to medical men, would not prevent its abuse. It is, indeed, only by general knowledge of its effects that its dangers can be obviated. To establish the pro- posed monopoly would, besides, be to show ingratitude to those who, after all, were the means of forcing hypnotism on the attention of the medical profession. Kritik der reinen Erfahruny. Von Dr. RICHARD AvENARIUS, Ord. Pro- fessor der Philosophie an der Universitat Zurich. Erster Band. Leipzig: Fues's Verlag (R. Reisland), 1888. Pp. xxii., 217. It is now twelve years since the author's Philosophie als Denken der Welt gednuss demn Princip des kleinsten Kraftmnaa.sses, or " Prolegomena to a Critique of Pure Experience," saw the light (MEND i. 298). The present volume, which is the first part of the projected " Critique," has the importance of philosophical work that has been long meditated and carefully elaborated. Its form, which, as the author admits, presents 41</page><page sequence="12">618 NEW BOOKS. some difficulty, has been deliberately chosen. The use of symbols that characterises it, besides being adopted as a means of directing the attention to the facts of experience apart from any traditional scientific or philosophical way of looking at them (p. 15), is also connected with the author's conception of philosophy as the formulation of experi- ence from the point of view of a disinterested spectator (p. 10). This conception requires, in his view, that consciousness should be temporarily abstracted from, and, accordingly, that the relations be- tween the observed organism and its environment should be presented in a mathematico-mechanical form. A few elementary symbols having been selected to designate fundamental conceptions, the author pro- ceeds, by constantly ramifying distinctions, to work out the relations of man to his surroundings, physical and social. The most important of the conceptions symbolically designated is that of " System C," or the part of the central nervous system that gathers up in itself the changes proceeding from the periphery, and distributes to the periphery the changes that have to be set going from the centre (pp. 35-6). The relation of the conservation of system C to the conservation of the organism having been formulated, the conditions are sought of the "vital conservation'" of system C itself. Certain "fictions," such as that of "ideal surroundings" and of "the ideal system C in not ideal surroundings " are introduced, and the conditions of approxima- tion to them investigated. After expressions have been found for the changes of system C and the conditions of its conservation (in less or greater degrees up to the "I conservation-maximum") and of its destruc- tion, the maintenance of the individual system C is considered in its relations to the corresponding systems of other individuals and their conservation. This leads to the formulation of the conception of the ';congregal system," or "I;C," the conditions of the maintenance and growth of which are then determined. The most favourable condition thinkable for the maintenance of the " total system"-whether C itself or MC-is found to be "when no partial system maintains itself by diminution, but each by augmentation of the vital conservation-value of others; so that that case would be designated as the perfect relation in which each single partial system should maintain itself perfectly under the greatest thinkable increase of the vital conservation-value of the greatest thinkable number of other partial systems, and in which accordingly the total system also should maintain itself perfectly under the greatest thinkable increase of the vital conservation-value of each single partial system " (p. 165). At the outset of the detailed analysis (p. 25), the question was put: "In what sense and how far can the constituent pacts pf our surroundings be taken as the presupposition of experience? " The result of the whole is summed up in a hypothetical answer to this question, given in the author's symbolical terminology, on pp. 199-200. Kritik der Kantischen Antinomienle7hre. Von Dr. FRANZ ERHARDT. Leipzig: Fues's Verlag (R. Reisland), 1888. Pp. 83. The author of this criticism of Kant's doctrine of the Antinomies, while recognising the solution Kant gave as "right in principle," aims at ?showing by detailed argament that the antinomies are " in themselves false ". The rejection of the doctrine of the antinomies, he contends, does not weaken Kant's system; for the ground of the Kantian trans- cendental idealism is not in the doctrine of the antinomies but, if any- where, in the Transcendental EBsthetic.</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 6,19 Alles in Allen. Metalogik-Metaphysik-Metapsychik. Von LuDWIG HALLER. Berlin: C. Duncker (C. Heymons), 1888. Pp. xv., 480. This (incomplete) posthumous work is an attempt at a speculative doctrine in the spirit of Parmenides and Spinoza. It manifests a certain feeling for the larger constructions of philosophical thought, but is hardly articulate enough for anything definite to be said as to its out- come. (1) Ueber Kant's Zahlbegriff, and (2) Stuart Mill's Zahlbegriff. Von Dr. CARL THEODOR MICHAELIS. Berlin: R. Gaertner (Hermann Heyfelder), 1884, 1888. Pp. 18, 18. The first of these pieces is a criticism of Kant's theory of the fo&amp;mda- tions of arithmetic. The author finds that not arithmetic but geometry is the starting-point of Kant's critical investigations; that he arrives at certain philosophical results from the consideration of geometry, and then tries to bring his conception of number into harmony with these. When arithmetic is considered independently, it is seen that number is the expression of synthesis generally, while space and time are only expressive of synthesis in a special form (p. 13). The conclusion, as regards the relations of the mathematical sciences, is that "geometry is applied arithmetic " (p. 15). The second piece is more a criticism of Mill as representing the traditional English philosophy than a special examination of his con- ception of number. The starting-point of philosophy, according to the author, ought to be a " reflection " (Besinnung) like that of Descartes and Kant, not empirical psychology, as with the English school (p. 16). While Kant's doctrine of number, although he has not rightly understood the nature of arithmetical synthesis, may be corrected by means of his own system, Mill's doctrine is fundamentally defective because based on empirical psychology. Allerlei aus Volks- unnd Menschenkunde. Von A. BASTIAN. Erster Band. Mit 3 Tafeln in Lichtdruck. Zweiter Band. Mit 18 photolitho- graphischen Tafeln. Berlin: E. S. Mittler &amp; Sohn, 1888. Pp. xi., 512; cxx., 380. No less comprehensive title than that which it bears could describe the wealth of material that is to be found in Dr. Bastian's latest con- tribution to the study of the minds of peoples. The second of the two volumes is illustrated by a series of plates (with explanatory text ex- tending from p. 240 to p. 358), which may be regarded as a supplement to the ethnological atlas that accompanied the author's immediately preceding work (see MIND xiii. 306). The ideas,selected for illustration are chiefly Buddhistic and Christian. There is nothing new in the way of theory, but the accumulation of facts- by which the author seeks to exhibit his ideas in concrete form is perhaps more extraordinary than ever. In vol. i., pp. 465-504, he returns to the subject of Theosophy and " spiritistic hocus pocus " discussed by him at some length in a former *work (MIND xii. 308). FRIEDRIx UiEBERWEG'S Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie. Dritter Theil. " Die Neuzeit." Siebente, mit einem Philosophen- u. Lit- teratoren-Register versehene, Auflage, bearbeitet u. herausgegeben von Dr. MAX HEINZE, ord. Professor der Philosophie an der Uni- versitat Leipzig. Berlin: E. Mittler u. Sohn, 1888. Pp. viii., 568. The two earlier parts of the latest (seventh) edition of this standard work were noticed in MIND xi. 688. The third part here follows, and</page><page sequence="14">620 NEW BOOKS. shows the same anxious care in the editor to keep up the character of the work as in every way the fullest and most serviceable History of the compendious class. The new matter incorporated adds 60 pp. to the size of the part as it stood in the sixth edition of 1883. A numerical statement of this kind, however, gives little notion of all that the editor has done for the book. While the additions axe chiefly made in the fourth section devoted to the present generation, but are also consider- able in the first which treats of the period of transition from the middle age, there are important changes in something more than the form of the second section. It 'was -a serious defect of the book in English eyes that Hobbes and others were made, a mere appendage to Bacon, and again Berkeley and others a mere appendage to Locke. The defect is now made good. Hobbes is set ini the forefront of a new independent para- graph; Berkeley gets the like recognition, which was so clearly his due; and there is besides a special paragraph given to English Deism, before the old one given to the 18th century moralists headed by Shaftesbury. The paragraph-division remains what it was in the third section-from Kant to Beneke; but in the fourth there has been the same desire as in the second to give more distinctive prominence to philosophical move- ments that are-or in as far as they are-distinct. One can but admire the extraordinary indistry, joined with discrimination, of the editor in his efforts to omit no bibliographical references of importance; on the philosophical jouLrnals especially he has kept his eye to excellent purpose and effect. It must be added that occasionally (as on p. 197) something is left to be desired in the accuracy with which titles of English books are printed. Der Ursprung der Sprache im Zusammenhange mit den letzten Fragen alles Wissens. Eine Darstellung, Kritik u, Fortentwicklung der vorzutg- lichsten Ansichten von Dr. H. STEINTHAL, a. o. Professor fuir Sprachwissenschaft an der Universitat zu Berlin, &amp;c. Vierte, aber- mals erweiterte Auflage. Berlin: F. Dtimmler, 1888. Pp. xx., 380. This edition is not a little altered from the third of 1877 (see MIND ii. 276), but is hardly at all extended, as that one was so greatly beyond what went before it. The additions have reference to the recent linguistic work (from 1876), and occupy more than a hundred pages, for which room is found chiefly by curtailing the account of Geiger which made so prominent a feature of the third edition. They fall under four heads. (1) The evidence, especiallythat of the Schipka-jaw, for a speechless race of men in the far prehistoric past, is discussed at length (pp. 264-81). (2) Noird's writings (from 1877) are 'subjected to a criticism not more trenchant than they need (pp. 281-319). (3) Wundt's views, as set out both in occasional and systematic form, are appreciatively con- sidered (pp. 319-50). Finally (4), the position of the author and his school is declared, in relation also to other contributions to linguistic theory made within the last decade (pp. 350-80). If there is a certain discontinuity in-the contents of the book, due to the manner in which it has been from time to time recomposed, there is certainly no want of fresh- ness and vigour of treatment either in the new or in the older parts. Die praktische Philosoplbie und ihre Bedeutung fur die Rechtsstudien. Ein Beitrag zur Reform unserer Universitaten von Dr. EDUARD FECHTNER. Wien: A. Holder, 1888. Pp. 87. This, like Prof. Angiulli's book noticed in No. 51, p. 459, is a plea for assigning to philosophy a central position in the higher education. Dr. Fechtner, starting from Mill's saying as to the purpose of the university,</page><page sequence="15">NEW BOOKS. 621 quoted also by Prof. Angiulli, goes on to protest against recent projects of reform that aim at dividing up university-education more and more into specialties -without any bond of union. The true bond of union, he contends, is philosophy; and now that specialising has been carried so far, there is more need of philosophy than ever. It is the interests of the faculty of law that -the author has chiefly in view. After insisting (with much support from distinguished jurists) on the importance of philosophy in general and ethics in particular for the scientific study of jurisprudence, he discusses in a last section (pp. 72-87) the question of the "-philosophical propmedeutic " in the Austrian Gymnasia. Here he finds himself supported in some of his special contentions by Dr. Meinong (see MIND x. 624), and in his general view of the place due to philosophical propadeutic in modern German education by Dr. Paulsen (MIND x. 312). He himself proposes to add ethics to the psychology and formal logic now taught in the Gymnasia, and would find a place for it by diminishing the mass of miscellaneous information which tends too much in modern education to replace the disciplinary subjects. Die holldndische Philosophie im neunzehnten Jahrhundert. Eine Studie von G. VON ANTAL. Utrecht: C. H. E. Breijer, 1888. Pp. 112. A detailed historical study of philosophy in Holland in the 19th century. The author regards Dutch philosophy as tending to an inter- mediate position between "the idealistic philosophy of Germany and the empiristic philosophy of England". "In the first half of the century it is idealistic, in the second empiristic, or-if the expression is preferred -positivistic." RECEIVED also: J.
