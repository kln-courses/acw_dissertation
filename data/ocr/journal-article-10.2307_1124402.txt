The narrow five-colored curtain at the far end of the bridge is raised and the MUSICIANS, excepting the stick drummer, who is not needed until near the end of the play, enter along the inner edge of the bridge, which leadsfrom up right to the upstage right corner of the square thrust stage. Then the CHORUS entersfrom the side door at upstage left and sits down in two rows stage left. Next the STAGE ASSISTANTS enter along the bridge with a prop-a light, four-sidedframe covered with a hanging cloth. Within this, invisible to the audience, is the GHOST. After placing theprop rear center stage infront of the MUSICIANS, the STAGE ASSISTANTS seat themselves stage right and a little behind the MUSICIANS. The drummers raise their drums to shoulder and hip. The flutist raises flute to lips and blows once shrilly. The sound of the flute is answered by the drummers' calls, which are followed by drumbeats, calls, and theflute again. More drumbeats, more calls. Finally, as the Prelude Music continues, the five- colored curtain rises once more and the TRAVELLER and COMPANIONS, unmasked and simply dressed, enter slowly across the bridge. They stop beside the upstage right pillar [four pillars, one at each corner of the stage, support the stage roof], and sing the Prelude Song.) TRAVELLER and COMPANIONS: [Prelude Song] The afterlight of creation, invisible to the eye, The afterlight of creation, invisible to the eye, Still sounds throughout the Universe. CHORUS: [Refrain] The afterlight of creation, invisible to the eye, Still sounds throughout the Universe. ( The TRAVELLER and COMPANIONS walk slowlyfoward andface the audience.) TRAVELLER: [Self-Introduction (spoken)] We come from the Veil Nebula in the Milky Way Galaxy. For millions of years we have searched the Galaxy and beyond for signs of other life, but have found nothing. Recently, however, we have discovered that life once existed on Earth, a planet of the now-extinct Solar System. So we are about to transform ourselves into light and depart for Earth's remains. (The TRAVELLER and COMPANIONSface each other.)</page><page sequence="3">DRIFTING FIRES TRAVELLER and COMPANIONS: [Travel Song (high-pitched)] Breathing in the light of a million stars, Breathing in the light of a million stars, Light-eaters of the skies, we turn to rainbows, Rivers coursing through the veins of infinity. (The TRAVELLERfacesfront, takes afew stepsforward, and then returns to his original position as the passage ends, signifying their arrival on Earth.) In and out of years, past worlds Muffled in the hiss of falling stars, Back and up, out and down, We ride the back of turtle time Bringing us to foreign shores, the ruins Of an ancient world. Here drifting fires Slowly bob on darkness like beacons Cast out upon the sea by a shipwrecked race. These are the flames that once were Earth, These are the flames that once were Earth. TRAVELLER: [Arrival Lines (spoken)] With the speed of light, we have arrived at the remains of Earth but find here nothing but flames. Let's return to our usual form and take a rest before looking around. (The TRAVELLER and COMPANIONS kneel on one knee beside the downstage left pillar, in front of the CHORUs,facing the bridge.) Section 2 (The GHOST begins to singfrom within the prop, without accompaniment, so low as to be almost inaudible. The STAGE ASSISTANTS unfasten the hanging from the top of the frame and very slowly begin to lower it, gradually revealing the fukai mask of a grieving middle-aged woman. By "I do not want to see it," when drums slowly begin, the fullfigure is visible. Dressed in a robe of red, gold, and orange brocade and kneeling on one knee, the GHOST is looking down slightly, as if singing to herself.) GHOST: [Recitative] Oh Sun! You warmed our days, The Moon and the stars Brightened our nights. 235</page><page sequence="4">Beichman FIGURE 20. Umewaka Naohiko, wearing the fukai mask, portrays the GHOST of Drifting Fires.

And the aftertaste of love, [Low-Pitched Song] Endless As my life On this melting frame of earth. [High-Pitched Song] I do not want to see it! I do not want to see it! Tell the night to come. I do not want to see the flames, Earth's blood! (She stands up and starts to walk slowlyforward.) I walk alone In the black light full of tears, Trailing memories and fallen stars. Section 3 (The GHOST makes a circuit about the stage, passing the TRAVELLER. As she is about to reenter the prop, the TRAVELLER speaks.) TRAVELLER: [Spoken Dialogue] I see something move among the flames. Can it be alive? ( The GHOST stops at the sound of his voice, slowly pivots to face him, and then, still silent, turns away and continues toward the prop. But the TRAVELLER persists.) We are travellers from the Veil Nebula, come in search of the remains of Earth. What sort of life are you? GHOST: (Back still to him.) Earth ... How can you know of Earth? TRAVELLER: We have only studied it from afar. To find you here astounded us, for we thought Earth's creatures were all extinct. GHOST: (Back still to him, about to step into the prop.) The Earth is dead. Go back to where you came from. 237</page><page sequence="6">Beichman TRAVELLER: We cannot. We must study Earth (The GHOST turns slowly to him) in order to understand ourselves. We are part of the same Universe. GHOST: Then speak to me of its beginnings. TRAVELLER: It began we know not when and so we say, "Out of Nothing" and "At the moment of Creation, that first, mysterious happening, forever repeated, forever lost in time." GHOST: And the stars and galaxies? TRAVELLER: [Shared Dialogue (half-sung)] From seething clouds of fire and ice, Spurting outwards from the Source, Like blazing eyes to light the dark, they surged and eddied across the skies GHOST: (Beginning to remember again.) And as they aged, grew dense and Rooted, rounded TRAVELLER: [Shared Dialogue (sung)] Into galaxies and stars That hung upon the darkness of the void GHOST: Like jewels upon the cheek of night TRAVELLER: And lived, then died GHOST: And dying, came new stars TRAVELLER: And galaxies of which GHOST: Our Sun was GHOST and TRAVELLER: One: (They take a step toward each other.) 238</page><page sequence="7">DRIFTING FIRES CHORUS: [High-Pitched Song] A great blind bird, grown from the ruins Of a burnt-out star.

TRAVELLER: Please tell me how your people came to be and how they ended. Section 4 (The GHOST goes to center stage and kneels on one knee.)

CHORUS: [Recitative] From it Earth and the other planets formed, Then life emerged from the seas and finally The crown, the blossom of all, GHOST: The first human being, CHORUS: [Melodic Song] Carved out of eternal matter And the light of vanished stars, In the morning thick like milk Looked up at the sky With wondering eyes, and with naked foot Walked the Earth and found it good.

We were born with the memory Of worlds unknown. Then billions of years passed and the Sun, Like any star, began to die. It swelled in the skies, A ball of fire ready to burst and bury the world. The seas boiled over, streets were slippery With the cries of victims and madmen. GHOST: We knew the Earth would be choked in fire And become a flaming hell. CHORUS: The Earth's glass dome split and shattered And burning air poured in. Those who could, fled, but most were lost. For centuries the sky was a forest of bones And after only fire and ash. Except for one old woman, beyond age, Beyond fear, who stayed behind To keep a pact with the Earth, With the Sun, with the stars. Section 5 GHOST: [Sung Dialogue] Walking alone In the afternoon full of fire and death, CHORUS: Dragging the soil and its roots, A sleeping cadaver, GHOST: I disappeared Into the flames CHORUS: Carrying the memory of the world.

TRAVELLER and COMPANIONS: [Song of Waiting (high-pitched)] Shadows of fire redden the darkness, Shadows of fire redden the darkness, faint As our hope. "O let her return!" we pray, But the roar of the wind buries our voices. We lay down our heads on pillows of flame and Wait for the ghost to appear in our dreams, We wait for the ghost to appear in our dreams. Section 2 (The GHOST enters by the bridge, stops at thefirst of the three pine trees along its length, and looks out at the audience over the bridge railing. Dressed in robes of blue and violet, she wears the uba mask of an aged woman and carries a cane. She looks totally decayed and yet so ancient as to be eternal, mad with grief and yet possessing a prophetic inward vision offinal things. She has suffered all there is to suffer, but her spirit has survived and even grown gentle.) GHOST: [Introductory Song] Infinite air, The morning thick like milk, Sweet matter ...

Then, through the side door, the CHORUs and the STAGE ASSISTANTS exit with the prop; last, the MUSICIANS exit over the bridge.) QUOTATIONS AND ALLUSIONS The use of extensive quotation and allusion is one of the conventions of no.a As music, song, and dance overlap to create a rich, multilayered texture, so the incorporation of lines from earlier works, often used in new contexts, gives a sense of the past echoing within the present. Sources for the quotations and allusions in Drifting Fires follow. All translations from the Japanese are my own.

AFTERWORD I have written about Drifting Fires in several other places before.1 Here I will only make some observations intended to be of use in staging the play. These points concern the relationship of music, song, and dance in no; the similarities between a classical no play and Drifting Fires in structure, theme, and plot; and some specific suggestions for interpreting the roles of the Ghost, who is the central character or Doer (shiteP), and the Traveller, who is the secondary character or Sideman (wakiq).2 250</page><page sequence="19">DRIFTING FIRES Aesthetic ideals of no: the relation of song, dance, and music In classical Western opera or ballet, the musicians are in the pit, separated from the performers and basically subsidiary to them. Performers and musicians both follow the same beat, and any disharmony between the two is a blemish on the performance as a whole. In no, however, a controlled dissonance, a constant, purposely unresolved tension between performers and musicians, is essential to the beauty of the performance. Their relationship is one of equality and reciprocity; its visual correlative is the musicians' position at stage center rear, facing the audience just as the actors do. It is not sufficient, therefore, to say that no is multimedia theatre. What makes it unique is not the simultaneous use of several media but the subtle balance of tension and harmony between those media. This aspect is most evident when each medium is represented by a separate group of performers, as in the relation between the musicians and the actors, but it also exists when the same performer's work in two media overlaps-as, for example, when the actor sings and dances. The relationship between song and dance in no has nowhere been more succinctly described than by Zeami Motokiyo (1363-1443), the great no theorist, actor, and composer. In The Mirror of the Flower (Kakyjr), he wrote: All significant movement in our theatre is a matter of sight and sound taken jointly, and is dependent, of course, upon word. It sometimes happens that you see movement simultaneously with sound; in extreme cases, movement may even precede the words in question. When this happens the proper order of hearing and of seeing has been reversed. First people should hear; let the significant movement come a bit later. If this order is followed the impression given is of a perfectly and totally rendered or realized experience of sound-sight. In other words, the experience I prize lies on the frontier, at just that point where there is a transition: the mind moves from hearing a passage toward perceiving the related movement.3 For Zeami, the relation between dance and song was so close that the title for the sixth section of The Mirror of the Flower is "Dance Has Its Roots in the Sound of the Voice," and in it he wrote: Where dance does not issue from the sound of the voice, it cannot be effective. It is when the attention of the observer is led in a transition from the short song which precedes dance-or one might say while the meaning of this poem is still echoing in the mind-to movement itself; it is at just this borderline between sound and sight that the marvelous power of dance exists. Likewise, the same can be said of the conclusion of dance issuing into the sound of poetry: dance concludes with the hearing of sound.4 Although Zeami wrote over five hundred years ago, what he said then still applies to no today. Dance and gesture are usually abstract or symbolic, but even 251</page><page sequence="20">Beichman when realistic they are far from being pantomimic illustrations simultaneous with the words. As Zeami expressed it in The Transmission of the Flower (Fushikadens), the ideal is the creation of "song which is movement and dance which is music." 5 Structure In creating the structure of Drifting Fires, I adopted the schema proposed by Yokomichi Mario more than twenty years ago.6 Yokomichi says that the structure of no is divided into a series of progressively smaller units beginning from the entire play itself and working down to line segments. The three most important divisions, in descending order of size, are the bat (scene or act), the danu (section of a ba), and the shodanv (module7). Of these, only the last element requires explanation. There are about thirty different kinds of modules. Some are instrumental only; others are also vocal. Every module has certain set musical and (if vocal) metrical characteristics, and many are associated with a particular character or point in the plot. The Prelude Song (shidaiW), for example, is in three lines. The first two lines are each composed of twelve syllables divided into two hemistichs of seven and five, while the third line is eleven syllables divided into hemistichs of seven and four. Although other modules can be used to begin a n6, the shidai is the module most often used, and it can also be used to introduce the second act of the play, or a dance. Wherever it is placed, however, its dramatic function is always introductory, its metrical structure unvarying, and its tune, with minor variations, the same. A few short sequences of modules are so common that they can be called typical. The sequence Prelude (shidai)-Self-Introduction (nanoriX)-High- pitched Song (ageutay)-Arrival Lines (tsuki-zerifuz) is one example. Here the Sideman's entrance to the shidai instrumental module is followed by the shidai sung module. The Sideman then introduces himself and announces that he is about to start on a journey in the nanori, describes his journey in the ageuta, and announces his arrival in the tsuki-zerifu. Two other common combinations are Spoken Dia- logue (mondoaa)-Shared Dialogue (kakeaiab)-High-pitched Song and Turning Song (kuriac)-Recitative (sashiad) -Melodic Song (kuseae). There are only a few such combinations, however, and the great freedom with which modules are usually combined makes it impossible to abstract any full-length sequence that could be called typical of all no plays.8 Theme One way of categorizing classical no is to divide them into two types: vision (mugenaf) no, which constitute the majority of the current repertory of about 250 works, and present-time (genzaiag) no. Both varieties take between forty-five minutes and two hours to perform. Vision no are usually presented in two acts separated by an Interlude (ai- kyogenah). The central character or Doer is either a supernatural being or the ghost of a dead human being, while the secondary character or Sideman is a living 252</page><page sequence="21">DRIFTING FIRES 253 human being, often a travelling Buddhist priest. Vision no in which the Doer is human often deal with his or her effort to achieve Buddhist salvation and in this sense differ from vision no in which the Doer is a supernatural being. Drifting Fires is a vision no whose Doer is the ghost of a dead human being. Such no have two further basic characteristics. First, their central theme is almost always the inward transformation of the Doer from delusion (in the Buddhist sense) to enlightenment or at least to partial enlightenment. This inward trans- formation corresponds to the Doer's visible passage from this world back to the next; this world is symbolized by the stage, and the passage between worlds is symbolized by the bridge (hashigakariai). Second, vision no with human Doers almost always have a core narrative around whose repeated tellings the plot revolves-other no very frequently are structured this way, as well. Each step of the plot-the Sideman's entrance, the Doer's entrance, their encounter and dialogue, the Doer's monologue or dance, the Doer's exit, the dialogue between the Sideman and the characters in the Interlude, the Doer's reappearance-involves another partial telling or re- telling of the core narrative. In the best-constructed no there are usually three or more partial tellings and retellings; each brings the Doer a little closer to a total revelation of the episode at the center of the core narrative. With total revelation of this episode comes full expression of the Doer's central emotion, which is what holds the Doer in thrall to this world, and sometimes, in its train, enlightenment.9 Plot In the first act (or scene) of a vision no with a human Doer, the Sideman- usually a travelling Buddhist priest-enters and journeys to a historic site. There he encounters the Doer disguised as an ordinary person. In answer to the Sideman's questions, the Doer tells part of the story or legend associated with the place (the core narrative). When the Sideman asks the Doer why such an ordinary person should know so much about events that happened so long ago, the Doer at first pretends to have no special connection to the place. Finally, though, the Doer reveals that it is really the ghost of the central character in the story it has just told. Having revealed itself, the Doer is overcome with shame. Asking the priest to pray for its release from the bonds of attachment to this world, it disappears, leaving the Sideman alone as the first act ends. Now the Interlude begins. The Interlude performer (aiaj), playing a commoner, a person of the neighborhood, enters. When the priest relates his strange encounter, the Interlude performer says that he must have met the ghost of so-and-so, retells the story of the site in a simple prose style quite comprehensible to medieval audiences (as opposed to the poetry of the first act), and exits. In the second act, the priest prays for the ghost until late at night and then falls asleep. The ghost appears in his dream, this time in its true form, and again tells part of the story surrounding the place. This time, however, its narration is in the first person, and it acts out its own part and sometimes that of other characters as well. The core narrative has been told once, either in whole or in part, in the first</page><page sequence="22">254 Beichman act; then again in the Interlude; and now, for the third time, in the second act. Each telling is different. In the first act, it is narrated in the third person, by the ghost disguised as a living person, often in poetic language. In the Interlude, it is again told in the third person, but by a person of the neighborhood and in prose. Now in the second act it is often told in the first person, with a new immediacy and drama. This third retelling often becomes a reenactment of the past. It may even begin with an assertion that the past has returned. In Nonomiyaak (The shrine in the fields), for example, the Doer enters at the beginning of the second act and sings "At the shrine in the fields blooming/With a thousand autumn grasses,/My flowered cart and its wheels/Turn, turn me back into the past."10 All happens again, in vision or in dream, as it happened then. Only this time it occurs in the curative presence of the Sideman, whose prayers ameliorate the Doer's attachment and therefore speed the Doer on the way to salvation. With the third retelling of the story in song and dance the Doer is transformed from a deluded being to an enlightened or partly enlightened one. Drifting Fires, like a classical vision no, is divided into two parts separated by an interlude. In the first part, the Ghost of the Last Human Being appears without identifying herself to a Traveller who has come from the Veil Nebula to explore the remains of Earth. The historic site is the remains of Earth, and the core narrative connected with the site is the life and death of the Solar System, Earth, and the human race. After this story is told, the Ghost reveals her identity and disappears, ending Act One. I have not yet written an Interlude for Drifting Fires. Given the probability that many authors of classical no did not write the intervals themselves, I do not feel any great urgency to do so. If the Interlude followed the most common pattern of classical vision no, a person who lived nearby would come out, discuss with the people from the Veil Nebula their recent encounter, explain the story of the Solar System, the Earth, and the human race in more detail and in everyday prose, and then exit. Since the Doer is the last human being, however, there can be no person living nearby on Earth. One could use a servant or companion of the Sideman (the Traveller), as is sometimes done in classical no. Or, as was done in the Japanese Interlude written for the Tsukuba performance of the play, take "nearby" in a galactic sense and use a creature from a nearby star or planet. This interpretation allows for a considerable amount of humor as well, not at all inappropriate in a classical no interlude. Other than the prose retelling of the core narration, the major requirement for the Interlude is that the Traveller must not become so interesting as a character that he impinges on the Ghost's theatrical space, which must remain supreme and central for a no to achieve its effect. Act Two opens with the Traveller and his Companions singing of their desire to see the Ghost again and then going to sleep for the night. The Ghost enters in her true form and once again tells the story that the work is built around: the story of the world. This time, however, she does not tell it from the largely third- person point of view of Act One but in the first person. With passionate involve- ment she describes how beautiful Earth was and how it felt to be human, to be born, to die. Then she dances in memory of the world, expressing in movement</page><page sequence="23">DRIFTING FIRES 255 what she has sung of in words. At the end, she steps out into space, carrying with her all that is left of the world. With this single gesture of total denial and total acceptance, she abandons everything that she is and simultaneously becomes something totally other. She is leaving home and returning home at the same time. She is at once completely alive and completely dead. The Doer's transformations The Doer in Drifting Fires goes through three transformations of identity. The first, at the end of Act One, is the transformation from a creature without memory to one who has remembered that she is the Ghost of the Last Human Being. The second is the inward transformation that occurs at the climax of Act Two at the end of Section 3, when she affirms her identity with all the dead. The third is an outward transformation that follows from this inward change and is a return to the nothingness from which she came. When we first meet her, the Doer is reliving again and again the moment when the Earth was destroyed before her eyes, an event so terrible that it has driven everything else from her mind. When the Traveller and his Companions speak of Earth, they unknowingly say the one word that could bring her back to reality. When she challenges them to tell her about the Universe, the outward reason is to make them prove that they are indeed from the same Galaxy, but behind that motive is a childlike hunger to hear of the world she has lost, to talk about what she loves. As they begin to tell the story of the Universe, which is an old and familiar tale to her and to them, her own memory is jogged and, drawn into the wonder of it again, she begins to recall the beauty of the beginning of life and humankind. But as the tale goes on, it again brings her back to the horrible last days, her own death, and the end of life as she knew it. When she comes to the point in the story when she herself died, she must stop speaking because that is where, for her, the story ends; she is now existing in a psychological space of nothingness. At this moment, she also reveals her true identity as the Ghost of the Last Human Being, and her first transformation-from an unidentified but strange creature who has almost forgotten who she is to a being who has remembered herself-is realized. When she returns in Act Two, it is as a spirit full of memory-completely opposite from the being we first saw at the beginning of Act One, whose memory was almost gone. In Act Two, Section 2, she remembers Earth's beauty and how she loved it. Then, in Section 3, she makes an outrageous claim-that she was every human being who ever lived-and appeals to each and every one to come alive again through her. There is an inward transformation: all those she has lost, all the people who ever lived, are imagined to be within her, and she becomes them. This inward transformation is what frees her from attachment to Earth, for now she will carry all humankind with her wherever she goes. She leaves for the void, ready to dissolve back into nothing, but she is carrying all of life within her. That is why I say she is both completely alive and completely dead. The Ghost's return to the void, which is both beginning and end, is the third transformation. It is simultaneous with the red and orange flames of Earth's</page><page sequence="24">Beichman ruins dissolving and giving way to the blue and violet primordial gases, as though the whole process of creation will begin again. The climax of the entire play is the third section of Act Two, especially the lines beginning "Come down to be born again ..." and ending "I am the end." Between "I am the end" and "I am stone: dark stone," I originally had the following lines: "I have died before./I have died with all ofyou./I will die again." I took them out because the Christlike connotations were misleading, but they are in a sense true and perhaps useful as a subtext for the performer playing the Ghost. The relation of the Sideman and the Doer In both classical vision no and Drifting Fires, the Doer's transformations are made possible by the catalytic presence of the Sideman. The most important change is the last-that which frees the Doer (though not always in classical no) from attachment to the past. Considering how important they are, however, most Sidemen are strikingly passive. They never dance (dance is performed only by the Doer and, if there is one, the Doer's companion), and their role consists mostly of inspiring the Doers to tell their story and dance, and then observing as they perform. The similarities between the Doer/Sideman encounter and the relation- ship between an orthodox Freudian psychoanalyst and patient are obvious." The final retelling and reenactment of the Doer's story is analogous to the retelling of a traumatic event in psychoanalysis. And the Sideman, who receives this retelling in silence and without comment, is similar to an orthodox analyst who deliberately suppresses his or her own personality as if to become a mirror in which patients can see their own psyches clearly and work out conflicts in a nonjudgmental, neutral atmosphere. Yet behind the seeming passivity of both the Sideman and the psychoanalyst lies, or should lie, a deep compassion. This compassion, while not expressed outwardly, is inwardly active and powerful enough to create an at- mosphere within which a troubled mind can come to terms with itself. Applying these observations to Drifting Fires, it is clear that the drama lies not in the outward dynamics of the relationship between the Traveller and the Ghost-how their feelings for each other develop, whether or not they come to love each other, and so on-but rather in the inward evolution of the Ghost as she comes to terms with her past. In this sense the work, like many vision no, is more lyric than dramatic and is suited more to no's style of restrained expression than to realism. Restraint is one of the characteristics of no that is most striking in compari- sion to the realism that has dominated European and American theatre since the nineteenth century. The more lyric and exalted in feeling a no is, the more restrained the performer should be in expression. Zeami's famous command, "Move the heart ten parts but the body seven only," 12 means that the performer should feel as intensely as possible but allow only seven-tenths of that feeling to be outwardly expressed in movement. The most extreme example of this dictum is the iguseal (Sitting Melodic Song), in which the Chorus sings while the Doer, motion- less, kneels at center facing the audience. Watching a mediocre performer in an 256</page><page sequence="25">DRIFTING FIRES iguse is likely to induce sleep, but a skilled performance creates a state of intensely expressive immobility that is deeply moving. No masks, like the performer sitting silently in the center of the stage, are immobile but can be tremendously expressive. It may in fact help the performers in Drifting Fires to model their faces on them. The no performer Umewaka Manza- buro (1868-1946) provided another useful image of the proper expression for a maskless performer: "The face should not express emotion, but neither should it look as though you were dead. It must be a face with a soul.'13 In most vision no, the reason for the Sideman's compassion for the Doer can clearly be traced to his profession, which is saving souls. The reason for the Traveller's concern for the Ghost in Drifting Fires, however, is less clear. Yet this very ambiguity can be used to create the sense of mystery and depth (yugenam) that is one of the aesthetic ideals of no. The Traveller knows the history of the Universe well enough to know how Earth ended; and if he knows that, and also knows of no other form of life than his own and that which once existed on Earth, then he must also have considered the possibility that his own form of life may have originated on Earth and that he himself is descended from those who fled Earth at its end. That is, he may well be returning to the ancestor of his own world, and his interest in the Ghost may come not only from cosmic loneliness or scientific curiosity but from a deep sense of kinship. To bring this possibility up openly, however, would place too much emphasis on the Traveller/Ghost relationship, which is not the center of the play- the Ghost is. It would also result in depicting both characters in an inappropri- ately anthropomorphic way-neither can be called human in any ordinary sense-that would trivialize the basic conception of the play. The possibility that the Traveller and the Ghost are related should be raised in such a subtle way that the audience is not even consciously aware of its having been broached unless they think about the play later on. There should be an ambiguous yet inexplicably moving sense of connection between the Traveller and the Ghost which exists outside the words of the play and is expressed by no more than a brief glance of surprise or half-conscious mutual recognition, or through an instant when they come near to one another at a moment of climax, as at the word "One" at the end of Act One, Section 3. By allowing themselves so little opportunity to express this deep sense of connection outwardly, the performers may discover how to express it from a point deep within. Thus they may acquire at certain points, like the no performer kneeling motionless through the Sitting Melodic Song, a mysterious intensity that will move the audience without its knowing why. As Zeami wrote, "Because it is hidden, it is the flower; if not hidden, it cannot be the flower." 14 NOTES 1. "De o matsu Eigo Shinsaku No6a," Nihon Keizai Shimbuna?

For this performance, Umewaka Naohikoaq performed the Doer role and did the choreography, while Richard Emmert composed the music, was musical director, and led the chorus. The other chorus members were Suda Masayukiar (also known as Matsui AkiraaS), Hatta Tatsuyaat, and Stephen Comee. Suda and Hatta doubled as stage assistants. Toda Osamua" was the Sideman. The musicians were Isso Yukimasaav and Isso Yukihiroaw on n flute, Okura Genjiroax on shoulder drum, Okura Shonosukeay on hip drum, and Mishima Gentar6az on stick drum. Matsumoto Kaoruba performed the Interlude, which was written by Shigeyama Akirabb and performed in Japanese.

In the no itself the Doer's climactic telling of a core episode in its own life is not presented as the cathartic experience necessary for salvation. The ostensible agent of salvation is prayer by the Sideman and/or the Doer. But the transformation is not psychologically credible unless one assumes that the repeated tellings of the narrative have created a setting in which the Sideman's prayers can work. 10.
