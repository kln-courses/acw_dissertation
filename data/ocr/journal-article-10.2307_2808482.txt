BRIEF NOTICES EVOLUTION THIS PROGRESS. The Tragedy of Evolution. By Bernard Acworth. Rich and Cowan, London. 7s.6d. net. 7- x 43; 334; 1934. Captain Acworth of the British Navy, author of The Navy and the Next War and Navies of To-day and To-morrow, not liking the present trends in politics, economics, engineering, industry, society, science, religion, or what have you, and attribut- ing these tendencies to the influence of the evolutionary viewpoint, proves to his own satisfaction that evolution never occurred, that God created each species ad hoc sub- stantially as described in the book of Genesis. In his rather cavalier treatment of the geological evidences of evolution his prin- cipal authorities are Sedgwick, who died in I873, and Dawson, who died in I899. Captain Acworth, with his passion for the Absolute, would no doubt reply that the date when a scientist reaches a conclu- sion bears no relevance to its truth, that truth is the same yesterday, to-day and forever. But the conclusions of a scientist at any given date must be based on the evidence then available; if new evidence is discovered the old conclusion may have to be changed. The argument from the geo- logical evidence is not merely "that be- cause man appeared after fish he is there- fore descended from fish" but that there is a graded series of fossil and living forms from fish to man and that as more and more fossils are discovered the gaps in the series are more and more completely filled. There is of course no question of proving past evolution in the same sense that we prove the existence of Julius Caesar. But there is an equal lack of historical testi- mony to special creation. If no one saw the evolution of reptiles into mammals, it is equally true that no one has seen God create a species. The authors of the accounts on which Genesis is based do not claim to have been present at the creation. On the other hand, as Conklin points out in his recent Penrose lecture, Nearly a score of new species of plants, having all the characteristics of true Linnaean species, have been artificially produced by hybridization or oper- ations under experimental conditions with consequent changes in chromosome numbers and associations. These new species are fertile inter se, but are sometimes sterile when crossed with either one or both of the parent species, thus fulfilling the strictest definition of true species as laid down by many systematists. We have thus definite evidence for experi- mental production of new species. Many of Captain Acworth's arguments, such as his repeated statement that Mendel disproved natural selection, are no doubt attributable to misunderstanding of a sub- ject with which he is not familiar. How- ever, in other passages his tone is that of a barrister determine to convince the jury at all costs. We fear that he belongs in the same category as Bishop Wilberforce, ''a man of restless and versatile intellect, who, not content with success in his own sphere of activity, plunges into scientific questions, with which he has no real acquaintance, only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric, and distract the attention of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digressions and skilled appeals to religious prejudice." 467</page><page sequence="2">468 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY THE MEN BEYOND MANKIND. A Study of the Next Step in Personal and Social Evolution. By Fritz Kunz. Rider and Co., London. 5 shillings net. 71 x 5-8; 2.36; no date. For a delightful, billowy ride the good ship Evolution takes wings of the lightest philosophical fabric. As it is with theo- sophical thinking, the hard won theories of science are spun out and stretched to make a bridge that reaches from the inner- most of man to the limits of the imagin- able. The style is straightforward, simple, and sincere, making delightful the clever characterizations of our typical social and mental absurdities. If one were not in- clined at times to stop and look for the parting of fact and fancy the excursion would be perfect, for the thesis is that there is no parting and all is unity. We learn that we are in the fifth phase of human evolution, the intellectual phase, characterized by the accomplishments of the Aryan race. The next, the sixth evo- lutionary billow of humanity, is destined to come from a fusion of races in America, Australia or New Zealand. If these coun- tries fail by misguided leadership Russia is the reserve selection of nature to fulfill the initiation of the age of intuitive brotherhood. Stupid social and economic systems as typified by our legal and finan- cial organizations, will have been sloughed off, and the leisure gained by the elimina- tion of economic cruelty will allow com- pletion of the arts, scientific knowledge, and theosophy. We venture the corollary that the moiling types of mankind will have long since died out from sheer bore- dom. The author points out that we can already see a terrible ennui affecting many young people who have leisure without intellectual development. We quote: (pp. zi5-zi6). "The world will then be a place of beauty, filled with people who have a desire to learn, and not a crass democracy where everyone thinks himself theoretically as good as his fellow, and, in fact, just a little better." And again: "There are some seven groups of ductless glands altogether, represent- ing the seven aspects of nature. Hence, all the other worlds are partially focused in the ductless glands, from the higher point of view, if not from the doctor's point of view." This is partly to say that there are seven phases to human evolution. The seventh phase is the spiritual realm of free souls and the grandeur of that area has not yet been completely imagined for mankind is only far enough advanced to dimly visual- ize the sixth area and is still confronted with the task of making that evolve. We are in the so-called trap of free will and cannot refrain from being conscious, so why hinder the progress of the coming epoch when all true knowledge will help toward its timely flowering? POUR ET CONTRE LE TRANSFORMISME. Darwin-Vialleton. By A. Mignon. Masson et Cie, Paris. 50 francs. 9 x 5-; 52I; no date (paper). The title of this book clearly reveals the object of the author: a comparison of Dar- win's theory with that of the late Profes- sor Vialleton. The latter in an attempt to base his theory only on paleontologic and embryologic evidence admits an evolu- tion of species but denies transformism. This viewpoint is based essentially on the following considerations: (i) transitional species have not been discovered; Archeop- teryx for example, he states, is a bird and nothing but that; (2) the earliest example of some species is organically more com- plex than the descendants now existing; (3) the homology of certain organs and ontogenesis cannot be associated with phylogenesis. Vialleton's belief is that each species springs forth in some geologic epoch, fully armed like Minerva, to evolve, decline and die. The time-of its "birth" and form of evolution is depend- ent on an unspecified "action intelligente." The author, in a manner deserving great praise, presents fully the elements of both theories placing well in relief their weak- nesses. He proceeds also to level criticism at some neo-Lamarckians and at the genet- icists who are advocates of the mutation theory. For him, the theory of the former is a scientific credo based on affirmations, and not facts, the latter have accomplished nothing because so far "la mouche droso- phile, pour torturee qu'elle soit, demeure une mouche." Still it is from the labora- tories that he hopes for future enlighten- ment.</page><page sequence="3">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 469 A book unreservedly recommended for all those who firmly believe in some theory of evolution. EARLY FORERUNNERS OF MAN. A Morph- ological Study of the Evolutionary Origin of the Primates. By W. E. Le Gros Clark. William Wood and Co., Baltimore. $5.00. IO x 6-; xvi + 196; I934. The author believes that the most profit- able method of determining the line of evolution which culminated in man is in studying, in proper perspective, the evolu- tionary development of the whole group of primates. Thus can be noted the trends of evolutionary development which became manifested in the early gen- eralized Primates, and by following them up, recognize which particular trends led to the line of evolution which culminated in Man." In this volume will be found a comprehensive survey of the results of studies in comparative anatomy and palae- ontology of members of the primate group arranged under such headings as: The evidence of the skull, the evidence of the teeth, the evidence of the brain, etc. There are also sections on the relation of the tree shrews to the primates, and on the distribution in space and time, and evolu- tionary radiations of the primates. In the latter chapter is emphasized the impor- tance of recognizing the principle of ortho- genesis in any philosophical study of the evolution of the human race. The in- vestigator will find this discussion of the early forerunners of man particularly use- ful in pointing out the gaps where future studies should be made. The book is well illustrated and documented and contains an index. THE MISSING LINK. Studies in Genesis. By Spencer H. Elliott. Group Publications, London. is. 6d. net. 68 x 4; I43; I934. The curious thing about the title of this book is that comparatively little is said in the book itself about the Missing Link. The "Genesis" of the subtitle is the first book of the Old Testament, not the phylo- genesis of the biologists. For the most part Canon Elliott is concerned with drawing moral and spiritual lessons in the usual clerical manner from the stories of Adam and Eve et al. However, in the first chapter he does consider evolution briefly and concludes that mankind has a twofold origin. On the physical side we may trace back our descent through the various stages of life to the dust of the ground from which we were formed; and we may have to admit that we have kinship with the ape, although we are not descended from him. But we have another pedigree which no ape can share-the human spirit which we trace back to God, Who breathed into mankind that which makes a man a living soul. This, he considers, is proved by the greater mental endowment of man. "The child of two, counting his toes, has al- ready proved himself to belong to a differ- ent order from that of the chimpanzee." Yet the child of two has developed with- out any discontinuity from the child of two weeks, who certainly shows no higher mental capacity than the chimpanzee. May not phylogenetic mental development have followed a similar continuous course? THE DINOSAURS. A Short History of a Great Group of Extinct Reptiles. By W. E. Swinton. Thomas Murby and Co., London. I5 shillings net. 81 x 5a; xii + 133 + 15 plates; I934. Probably few Americans outside of the scientific group are aware that the region extending from Colorado and Utah north through Red Deer River and Edmonton areas of Canada has contributed the most important finds as well as the most numer- ous specimens of dinosaurs. The writer of this book, an authority on dinosaurs, is on the staff of the Natural History Section of the British Museum. He gives to the general reader a well rounded picture of all that exploration and research have con- tributedi concerning these ancient reptiles. Even a chapter on disease is included. The numerous illustrations throughout the volume are well chosen. Each section concludes with a bibliography and in the two appendices are given (a) a list of British dinosaurs including author, hori-</page><page sequence="4">470 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY zon, locality, reference and type specimen; and (b) a glossary and notes. There is a detailed index. THE CONSTRUCTION OF MAN'S FAMILY TREE. By Sir Arthur Keith. Watts and Co., London. i shilling net. 71 x 44; vi + 54; I934. In this little book Sir Arthur Keith traces the history of the various family trees by which zoologists since Haeckel have re- constructed the ancestry of man. He con- cludes that in broad outline Haeckel's schematization has been borne out by later discoveries of fossil primates, that the resemblances between man and the great anthropoids are more reasonably explained by the descent of man from a common anthropoid stock than by convergent evo- lution, and that Klaatsch's theory that the anthropoids are degenerate forms of humanity runs counter to the geological record. GENETICS ENVIRONMENT AND GROWTH. By Barkev S. Sanders. Warwick and York, Inc., Baltimore. $4.00 + postage. 9 x 7 58; xviii + 375; I934. This painstaking study shows, in the author's opinion, that the deductions of the Pearson School from cor- relation studies are untenable, not merely in respect of growth but in all other spheres where an attempt has been made to evaluate the contribution of heredity on environment through this methodology without the use of other correctives. Furthermore the author tells us that: The present study was therefore undertaken for the sake of a more intensive and extensive analysis of the evidence bearing on the relative contributions of heredity and environment to physical growth and development, and a more rigid determination of the tenability of the deductions from correlation studies. The organized data presented in the subsequent pages do not sustain the claims of extreme hereditarianism, more specifically the deductions of the Pearson School which deny the importance of milieu on ontogenetic traits. These are strong words, and Professor Pearson is a considerable person, who has collected and analyzed probably more quantitative data pertinent to the problem of nature and nurture than any other per- son who has ever lived. It is not unrea- sonable, therefore, to examine the basis upon which rests Dr. Sanders' alleged demolition of the structure so laboriously reared by Pearson and his co-workers over a long span of years. Are new and more pertinent observational data brought into the arena by Dr. Sanders? The answer is no. He has collected no new observa- tions. Has he discovered a new and more potent method of analysis? Again the answer is no. All that he has done is (i) to criticise the logic of biometric technique (in the first chapter) on grounds and in a manner that we fancy Prof. Pearson could make very fine hash indeed of, if he felt it desir- able to take the trouble to do so. (z) To review at length the biological literature (in Chapter m) that supports the somewhat trite platitude that heredity and environ- ment are inseparable relative to living organisms, each playing a role in the determination of every ckaracteristic of every organism. Incidentally we suspect that there lives no biometrician so dumb as not to be aware of this. As might be expected the author finds the idea that acquired characters may be transmitted to the progeny a seductive one. (3) To review at great length an enormous body of literature (in the next five chapters) on the general subject of differential growth in relation to environment. A final chapter sums up the author's conclusions. An indexed bibliography of 65 pages close- set in 8-point type, and a subject index complete the volume. The book has two merits. The first is the author's insistence, reiterated again and again throughout the book, on the importance of more and more penetrating investigations of the specific effects of pre- cisely defined environmental variables upon the human organism, rather than general studies of "heredity versus environ- ment." By any technique now conceived of, these latter studies will never convince anyone except their protagonists, the boys who did them, on one side or the</page><page sequence="5">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 47I other. Dr. Sanders' second significant contribution is his bibliography, and the annotations on it, which is, in effect, what the text of his Part II is. This bibliography will make the book a valu- able reference book for a long time to come. The book is very well produced, and the publisher deserves all praise for undertak- ing so tremendously expensive an enter- prise in times like these. THE CHANCES OF MORBID INHERITANCE. Edited by C. P. Blacker. William Wood and Co., Baltimore. $5.00. 81 x ; xi + 449 + 3 plates + 3 folding charts; '934. This symposium on various disease forms which directly or indirectly are supposed or known to be inherited is written espe- cially for the physician faced by the prob- lem of advising his patients on whether they should have children. The diseases discussed are: nervous disorders and epi- lepsy (W. Russell Brain), mental disorders (A. J. Lewis), mental deficiency (H. Herd), disorders of the eye (Stewart Duke- Elder) and of the ear (E. J. McCann), asthma and other allergic diseases (G. W. Bray), blood (L. J. Witts), cardio-vascular (M. Campbell), renal (A. A. Osman), skin (L. Forman), gastro-intestinal (M. E. Shaw), cretinism and goitre (H. Gard- ner-Hill), diabetes mellitus and glycosuria (R. D. Lawrence), tuberculosis (E. R. Boland), neoplastic diseases (A. Piney), congenital abnormality of the skeleton (H. A. Harris). Included are also a very good chapter on genetic principles by R. Ruggle s Gates and one on the analysis of pedigrees by L. Hogben. Although not all the subjects have been well treated, some omitting the results of the more recent studies, still it must be said that this represents a very useful con- tribution. Outstanding and praiseworthy is the fact that the evidence is presented objectively without drawing unwarranted conclusions or attempting to inject eu- genics propaganda. There is a glossary of genetic and psy- chiatric terms and an index of nine pages. The references are at the end of each chapter. L'EvOLUTION. ADAPTATIONS ET MUTA- TIONS. Berceaux et Migrations.

La Pal6eontologie et les Grands Probhemes de la Biologie Gene6rale. By C. Fraipont. Hermann et Cie, Paris. 6 francs. IO x 61; 16; I932 (paper). These are the first two of a series of five brief monographs by Prof. C. Fraipont and associates in which they discuss different aspects of organic evolution and review the evidence which- favors a more or less modified Lamarckism as against the muta- tion theory. In the first, the authors summarize Rosa's Ologenesis theory and accept the latter's assertion that each species appears for the first time simultaneously in all parts of the globe where conditions permit its existence. It is only after the species has passed its maturity and is dying that it is gradually restricted to a smaller area. The authors present maps to show the extent of the habitat of different species as it appears from the earlier geologic record and its reduction in later periods or at present. There is no necessity, conclude the authors, to seek a place of origin for the species nor to set up imagined reasons for mass migrations, etc. In the second, the Lamarckian principle of gradual adaptation is reaffirmed and the author heatedly denies the value of the negative laboratory experiments as proof against the theory. Is this a true revival of Lamarckism at the hands of paleontologists who have always been partial to it or is it the last flicker of life from old French "die-hards?"</page><page sequence="6">472. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY RACING CAPACITY IN THE THOROUGHBRED HORSE. Part I-The Measure of Racing Capacity. Part 11-The Inheritance of Racing Capacity. Carnegie Institution of Washing- ton, Supplementary Puhlications No. 7. By Harry H. Laughlin. Carnegie Institu- tion of Washington, D. C. 50 cents. 98 x 68; z6; I934 (paper). Two empirical formulas are discussed; one for determining an index of racing capacity of an individual horse in terms of age, sex, weights carried, distances run, and speeds attained; the other, for determining an index of the most probable racing capacity of an individual horse in terms of the rac- ing capacities of its direct and collateral near-kin. In the derivation of both for- mulas, as has always been the case in at- tempts to develop single indexes designed to represent complex functional abilities, it was necessary to assign arbitrary weights for the proportional influence of different variables. Whether or not all of the important variables were con- sidered, and whether or not approximately correct weightings were given, obviously, can be known only after the indexes have been used very extensively. It may be presumed, however, that the really im- portant variables were included and that a reasonably satisfactory weighting or stres- sing of each has been obtained. Unfor- tunately the observational data on which the study was based are not included and only the most superficial information is given of the analytical methods used. EMBRYOLOGY AND GENETICS. By Thomas H. Morgan. Columbia Uni- versity Press, New York. $3.00. 8- x 52 Vii + 2.58; I934. Professor Morgan has resorted to several kinds of simplification in order to make his survey of experimental embryology and developmental genetics into a stimulating textbook for college and medical school students and for others in search of an up- to-date and authoritative introduction to these subjects. His aim has been to illus- trate the principles underlying devel- opment rather than to describe the embryology of individual types in detail, and to make the reader attentive to the logical implications of the data of obser- vation and experiment. Verbal explan- ations have been replaced whenever possible by illustrations, and bibliographic refer- ences have been omitted from the text. There is a selected bibliography in the back of the book, however, and an index. GENERAL BIOLOGY STUDIES OF THE WATERS ON THE CONTI- NENTAL SHELF, CAPE COD TO CHESAPEAKE BAY. I. The Cycle of Temperature. Papers in Phvsical Oceanography and Meteorology, published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Vol. II, No. 4. Contribution No. 34 from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. By Henry B. Bigelow. Woods Hole Oceano- graphic Institution, Woods Hole, Mass. $I.OO. ii x 82; I35; I933 (paper). This paper is a continuation of studies on the thermal status of the waters over the off-shore part of the continental shelf, begun in I9I3 by the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries and Museum of Comparative Zoology. Cruises for the collection of temperature readings were made during several months of the year from I927 to I93Z. Results are given in tables and graphically in the form of thermal contour lines on outline maps. The author may be commended for a clear-cut and concise report of basic data of first order impor- tance. THE TEACHING OF BIOLOGY. By William E. Cole. D. AJpleton-Century Co., New York. $2 oo. 7-8 x 5; XiV + z5z; I934. This book deals with the teaching of biology as a unified subject, that being the accepted organization for the secondary school. The treatment is from the imme- diate viewpoint of the teacher, in simple and interesting language, and the treat- ment is thoroughly modern in the light of educational theory and practice. Fea- tures of practical importance are: The abundance of suggested teaching aids;</page><page sequence="7">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 473 equipment, use and arrangement of labora- tories; and appendices including a classified bibliography, a list of outstanding maga- zines of science, addresses of scientific supply houses, and forms for survey blanks for a number of local problems in biology. There is a brief but adequate index. The treatment of the subject as a whole will be especially helpful to anyone interested in the teaching of elementary biology. PRINCIPLES OF ANIMAL BIOLOGY.

LABORATORY DIRECTIONS IN PRINCIPLES OF ANIMAL BIOLOGY. Fourth Edition. By A. Franklin Shull, with the collabora- tion of George R. Larue and Alexander G. Ruthven. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York. $i.oo. 9 x 58; ix + IOO; I934. In the present revision of his well-known college textbook the author has directed his efforts towards a greater simplicity in exposition; but, on the whole there is very little difference between this and the pre- vious editions (cf. this REVIEW, Vol. 5, p. Z48). The same can be said for the Fourth edition of Laboratory Directions which serves nicely to teach beginners some prac- tical applications of the fundamental prin- ciples o biology. HUMAN BIOLOGY FRANKLIN PAINE MALL. The Story of a Mind. By Florence R. Sabin. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. $2.75. 81 x 52; xiii + 342 + 8 plates; I934. Franklin P. Mall was unquestionably one of the leading figures in the scientific world of his time. While always zealously and overtly holding faithful to his first love, medicine, he was more than a medical man. For one thing he was one of the acknowledged leaders of his time in bi- ology, and unquestionably had more to do than any other one person with changing the status of human anatomy in this coun- try from being the lowly hand maiden of surgery to a branch of general biology. Again he was no less a leader in altering the outlook of American universities rela- tive to the dignity, the methods, and the spirit of the teaching of science. He has waited a decade and a half for a biographer. But as he himself would say if he could; it paid to wait! For Dr. Sabin's is a masterly piece of biographic writing-a worthy, just, and adequate treatment of a great subject. And it is done with a devotion that plainly must have made the labor a delight. But fine as is this devotion to the master from a pupil now herself a master, it is not that which makes this a notable book. It is rather the fact that Dr. Sabin has, with great shrewdness and good judgment, set Mall's life as the central jewel in the coruscating background of the most bril- liant period of equal length in the progress of the medical sciences that history has yet recorded- "the period of Claude Ber- nard, Virchow, Cohnheim, FHoppe-Seyler, Schmiedeberg, Lister, Helmholtz, Pasteur, Koch, Ludwig, and His-the period of the foundation of new medical sciences- bacteriology, cellular pathology, bio- logical chemistry, and later immunology." Mall's career as a student started as this period was beginning. He was an impor- tant figure in it. The theme is clear and Dr. Sabin has done full justice to it. The book is, in short, a contribution of first- rate importance to the history of ideas, and not just another biography. The first chapter on early life and educa- tion shows how inadequate was the train- ing the Middle West had to offer a boy of Mall's capacities in the '6o's and '70's. In the autumn of I883 he went to Germany, et incipit vita nova. During the next three years, first with His and then with Lud- wig, his research laid the foundation of his enduring reputation. These were very happy years. At their end he came to Baltimore as a fellow in pathology under Welch in the newly opened Johns Hopkins Medical School. There, except for short interludes at Clark and Chicago, he spent the remainder of his days. Space is lacking to follow in detail the</page><page sequence="8">474 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY course of events in a busy life. The book itself must be read, and then one will see with the utmost clarity how and why Mall influenced students, teaching, re- search, scientific societies, journals, in- stitutes and foundations as he did. We can do our readers no greater service than to urge them to read this book. For it is their book, written for biologists, by a biologist, about a great biologist. NEGRO-WHITE ADJUSTMENT. An Investi- gation and Analysis of Methods in the In- terracial Movement in the United States. The History, Philosophy, Program, and Tech- niques of Ten National Interracial Agencies, Methods Discovered Through a Study of Cases, Situations, and Projects in Race Re- lations. By Paul E. Baker. Association Press, New York. $3.0o. 94 x 6; z7I; I934 This study is based on an investigation of ten national interracial agencies in the United States and was presented as part of the work for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Columbia University. The first 47 pages have to do with the methods of investigation and the history, philos- ophy and program of the interrracial agencies. Section III which forms the bulk of the volume is concerned with A discovery of methods through a study of the activity of interracial agencies in typical situa- tions. Summing up the results of his study the author finds that After this extensive review of the facts our con- clusion must be that present attempts to solve Ameri- can interracial problems are characterized by the presence of two distinct goals and two distinct methods of reaching those goals. These goals are at one extreme a definitely bi-racial society and at the other extreme a completely assimilated race, while the general methods used are either those of conference and cooperation or those of pressure and violence. On the basis of present trends it seems probable that the conference technique will be used increas- ingly, but that the conflict method will grow in favor until it effects such reorganization of society as will give the Negro equal status and so make possible the use of the conference technique on an equality basis. If this occurs, the assimilative process will progressively eliminate race differences and so make unnecessary any further interracial effort. If it does not occur, we can envision between the races only continued conflict which palliative methods of ad just- ment can mitigate but never solve. The volume concludes with a bibliog- raphy and an index. Z, A CHILD WENT FORTH. The Autobiography of Dr. Helen MacKnight Doyle. Byv Helen M. Doyle. Gotham House, New York. $3.00. 8 x 54; 364; I934. Dr. Helen MacKnight Doyle tells vividly her struggles as a pioneer in the practice of medicine. The first part of the book is a personal record of childhood memories of the spacious '8o's in California. Grand- mother had a lace cap and knew how to make brown gravy. No salad and salted nuts days were those; in fact not until our author was enrolled as one of three women medical students in Toland Hall in old San Francisco did she hear of a salad. Women were not wanted in the medical schools of those days and were frankly told so, but Helen MacKnight's Scotch stubbornness carried her through her years of study and internship to a practice of her own. There is much of historical interest concerning San Francisco and the Sierra Nevada country but perhaps the most interesting part of the narrative is the struggle for existence of the pioneer women physicians. The first woman student at Toland Hall was told by one of her pro- fessors: "A woman has no business to study medicine. If she does, she ought to have her ovaries removed." To this she replied: "If that is true, the men students ought also to have their testicles removed!" As regards the physiological and psychological limitations of women in medicine Dr. Doyle relates that three weeks before her baby was born she at- tended a woman in confinement and did the same three weeks after. As Mary Austin says in her foreword: ". . . it is difficult to separate Dr. Nellie's success in a difficult and exacting profession from her success as a woman. And in saying that, one has perhaps stated the final judgment of this whole vexed problem of women in pro- fessions. "</page><page sequence="9">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 475 LA REVOLUTION DEMOGRAPHIQUE. Etudes et Essais sur les Problemes de la Population. Bv Adolphe Landry. Recueil Sirey, Paris. Z5 francs. 9 x 55; zz9; I934 (paper). The first and larger part of this book (I65 pages) contains two long essays on the demographic revolution and depopula- tion and decadence respectively. The first is a careful, cautious discussion of the falling birth and death rates and the ap- proach to a stable population, with special reference to the consequences in manifold directions of these phenomena, particu- larly as they apply to France. Nothing very new is developed in the way of results or ideas, but the author has the merits of conservatism and realism. He handles the facts in a scholarly way, and points out with brutal clarity that there is no simple or miraculous solution that can be applied to check or control a tend- ency towards depopulation once it is well started in any population, and es- pecially in a highly civilized and intelli- gent one. The second essay discusses the association between depopulation and de- cadence, chiefly upon the basis of the history of Greece and Rome (the monde romain, not I1 Duce's home office). Again a scholarly discussion, saturated with pessimism. What Landry's argument seems to lack is an adequate appreciation of the fact that human biology has been, as yet, but very imperfectly explored; and of no region is this more true than of reproduc- tion. Like Malthus his reasoning and his viewpoint are those of the historiog- rapher and "social scientist"so-called. His pessimism is essentially a mirror image of Malthus's and is quite as likely to be made silly by the unpredicted and still unpredictable course of human reproduc- tion in the mass under the impact of altered circumstances. The second part of the book reprints four short essays on various aspects of popula- tion problems. BLINDNESS AND THE BLIND IN THE UNITED STATES. By Harry Best. The Macmillan Co., New York. $6.50. 94 x 64; xxii + 714; I934. An extensive survey which will be found invaluable by social workers and those interested in public health, by legislators, and by physicians. The chief object of the study was to furnish the social econ- omist with a working treatise on a subject which up to the present has been dealt with in a humanitarian rather than in a scientific manner. The blind are regarded as "certain components of the population of the state who demand classification and attention in its machinery of organi- zation." In the seven sections of ihe survey no important phase of the subject has been neglected. How wide the scope of the book is can best be indicated by picking at random a few of the topics of discussion: Causes of blindness, possi- bilities of prevention, the blind by sex, by race, by nativity, marital conditions of blind, extent of education among blind, legal treatment, cost, history of education of blind in United States, public and private institutions for the blind, use of raised print, libraries, homes for adult blind and for children, industrial estab- lishments for blind, pensions, indemnity, private associations and public commis- sions for blind, etc., etc. An enormous amount of statistical data is given; there is a section on conclusions with respect to work for blind, and in a group of five appendices will be found additional tables and illustrations. The volume is indexed. .N JAPANESE IN CALIFORNIA. Based on a Ten per Cent Survey of Japanese in California and Docurmentary Evidence from Many Sources.

The survey, made by twelve people five of whom were of the Japanese race, covered certain definite geographical districts of about iooo persons each. City, town and country dwellers were represented. Out of a total population in California of 97,456 Japanese, 9,4I6 (half of whom were children) were personally interviewed. Concerning the birth rate of the first generation in the United States, records show it to be higher than that of the whites, but not as high as frequently has been claimed. The Japanese married man has had about 3.I children on the average and the Japanese woman 3.3 children. The birthrate of the second generation cannot be estimated for only a handful are old enough to marry but "it would appear that these young people educated in American schools are most likely to imitate their white acquaintances and limit their families very decidedly." The statistical data are arranged in 68 tables. Included in the report is a section on the distribution of the Japanese in the United States. There is an index. MATERNAL MORTALITY IN FIFTEEN STATES. United States Department of Labor, Chil- dren's Bureau Publication No. 2-73 U. S. Government Printing Office, Wash- ington. zo cents. 9' x + I934 (paper). This report, following the recent pub- lication by the New York Academy of Medicine Committee on Maternal Mor- tality in New York City in I930, I93I and I932., gives similar data on maternal mor- tality in i92.7 and i92.8 for the states Alabama, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, Cali- fornia and Oklahoma. In both studies, reported cases of puerperal deaths were investigated by trained field personnel, detailed histories of the circumstances of each death were obtained and the data trans- mitted to their respective committees for analysis. Both committees arrive at much the same general conclusions. It is pointed out that a very large proportion of maternal deaths are preventable; that there is great need for better training of persons responsible for maternal care; that physicians and their organized medical societies must assume the leadership in the field; that the general public must be given widespread education of the impor- tance of prenatal, natal, and postnatal care, the angers of abortion, and of their own responsibilities. The Children's Bureau is to be commended for carrying through this extensive and valuable in- vestigation. Special praise should goto Dr. Frances Rothert for her clear-cut analysis and well written report. TEE MYSTERY OF STIGMATA. From Catherine Emmerich to Theresa Neumann. By Jeanne Danemarie. Translated from the French by Warre B. Wells. Burns Oates and Washbourne, London. 5 shill- I 1 3 ings. 7T x 4I; viii + Z48; I934. A devout and cultured Roman Catholic with a penchant to describe her own mystic feelings writes this book on stig- mata in which she sketches the lives of the nineteenth century stigmatized nun, Anne Catherine Emmerich, her official biographer, Clement Brentano, and her spiritual descendant, Theresa Neumann of Konnersreuth whom the author personally visited. It is on her own personal emo- tions that Mme. Danemarie dwells so that we learn no more about Theresa Neumann than that which has appeared in numerous articles and books (cf. Kon- nersreuth, noticed in Vol. 8, p. I75 of this REVIEW). Written in a style sui generis, this book and the gentle author also might well have been contemporaries of Jacopone da Todi of whom we are reminded by the following words taken from the intro- duction: "Here is the story of the journey that led me to the Stigmatised Woman of Bavaria, all athrob with the martyrdom of her wounds and the clairvoyance of her ecstasies." The work of the translator appears to have been well done.</page><page sequence="11">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 477 EARLY DAYS AMONG THE CHEYENNE AND ARAPAHOE INDIANS. By John H. Seger. Edited by Stanley Vestal. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman. $z.oo. 9 x 6; I55; I934. This interesting book gives an account of the author's experiences among the Indians in the early years of their life on reserva- tions. Most of the officials of the agency were Quakers, full of the noblest inten- tions but with little insight into the ways of thought of their Indian charges. They tried to teach the Indians to farm but, quite understandably, the latter preferred the excitement of hunting buffaloes to the drudgery of farming. Seger started as builder and Jack-of-all-trades on the res- ervation but soon acquired so much pres- tige among the Indians by his courage and conjuring feats that he was made head of the school for the Indian children. His struggles to maintain discipline among his pupils and their parents, who not in- frequently drew a gun or a knife on him, the loyalty of the Indians after he had succeeded in making them his friends, the disputes between the Indians and the white settlers, are all interesting chapters in the history of the relations between the two races. An appendix gives the tribal tradition of the Cheyenne Indians as told to Mr. Seger by one of the chiefs to whom it had been handed down by word of mouth. THE PEOPLING OF AUSTRALIA. (Farther Studies.) By K. H. Bailey, J. B. Brigden, H. Burton, D. B. Copeland, F. W. Eggleston, A. S. Kenyon, F. R. E. Mauldon, H. A. Mullett, G. Packer, P. D. Phillips, W. I. Potter, G. Taylor, S. M.

In this volume we find a continuation of the investigations on the demographic and intercorrelated economic conditions of Australia (cf. Vol. 5, p. 473 of this REVIEW). The present survey gives a sum- mary of the immigration policy both his- torically and from the standpoint of the state of public opinion towards new im- migration; the limitations imposed by the economic conditions of Australia to an increase in population; the apparent im- mediate effects of state aided settlements. The several authors limit themselves to an exposition of the facts which can be used to support either of the two opposing viewpoints: limited immigration or low- ering of the barriers. Each is consistent per se depending on the future; i.e., whether Australia will continue to be an exporting nation or must rely entirely on its own market. In regard to the State planning of communities, all agree that the experience so far has been isastrous for the public exchequer. CHILD MARRIAGE: The Indian Minotaur. An Object-Lesson from the Past to the Future. By Eleanor F. Rathbone. George Allen and Unwin, London. zs. 5d. net. 74 x 48; 138; 1934. Since I846 Indian administrators have passed laws tending to curb child marriage so prevalent amongst the natives. These laws have been ineffectual as is known and the author in rather violent manner lavs the blame on the English and Indian authorities whom she accuses of fearing the effects of applying such obviously un- popular regulations. The descriptions of the sad state of the Indian woman arouse pity. Early marriage, aside from the grave social burden which it imposes, has as direct evil there the high mortality due to lack of hygienic measures in puer- perium. But the author, evidently gifted with a highly developed reform complex, shows lack of political insight in her attack on the already troubled officials, and the short-sightedness common to re- formers in her proposed amendments to the latest statutes (Sarda Act). They are three, two of which would permit pros- ecution by the courts on privately ob- tained information. In addition, her main method of attack would be to grant greater political franchise to women and arouse then their organized protest. It has ap- parently not occurred to the author that the fundamental and immediate need is</page><page sequence="12">478 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY that of alleviating the hygienic condi- tions, and that social evolution would follow as a consequence. KEITH LUCAS. Contributors: H. H. Turner, F. C. Temple, Sir Walter Fletcher, G. LI. Hodgkin, E. D. Adrian, Mervyn O'Gorman, Bertram Hop- kinson, R. H. Mayo. W. Heffer and Sons, Cambridge. 5 shillings net. 74 x 52~; I3I; I934. After the death of Keith Lucas in the World War Sir Walter Fletcher, with whom he had been associated at Cam- bridge, intended to prepare a memoir of him and, with this end in view, asked several of Lucas' friends to write accounts of those aspects of his life with which Fletcher was not himself familiar. How- ever, other duties interfered and the memoir was never written. The papers are therefore here published in their original form with the addition of an account by Professor Adrian, a pupil and later a colleague of Lucas, of his life at Cambridge and of his pioneer work on the excitation of nerve and muscle which Adrian himself has continued so bril- liantly. The chief impressions which the book leaves are of Lucas' personality, the clearness of thinking -which enabled him to state his problems in a form which would permit of an answer, and the me- chanical skill with which he constructed his experimental apparatus. A list of his scientific writings is given. SCIENCE, RELIGION AND MAN. By William J. J. Cornelius. Williams and Norgate, London. iS shillings net. 82 X 52; 387; I934- The author's formal definition of God is "the idea of power exercised by a Spiritual Agency." While for the modern man who does not believe in the existence of God "an absorbing intellectual interest" may be his god "no one can get rid of the necessity of a god." The real nature of God will be revealed. "The adventure we make justifies our action if simply and honestly made, and if proof does not come to us in this life it is because that is reserved for the time when, purified and fit for the vision by transformation, man shall see God as He is.'" Religion is not so simple and is finally decided to be "incapable of exact definition." IncLuded in the volume are chapters on magic and a very much condensed survey of various religions, ancient and modern. There is a bibliography and an index. INCOME IN THE VARIOUS STATES. Its Sources and Distribution. 1919, I920, and 1921. By Maurice Leven. Based upon Estimates of the National Totals by Willford I. King. National Bureau of Economic Research, New York. $3.50. 9 x 6; 306; ig925. This book gives estimates for the various states in I9I9, i92.0, and i92.i of current income-including "(i) wages, salaries and pensions, (z) profits withdrawn from business, (3) dividends, interest, and rent received by individuals, (4) the rental value of homes occupied by their owners, (5) interest upon the sums invested in household furnishings, clothing, and the like, and (6) the value of commodities which families produce for their own con- sumption' -and gains or losses in the value of property owned. The per capita current income of the Southern states is much below that of the rest of the country when the entire population of each state is considered but the current income of the farm population per farmer and family shows no such wide disparity.

This seems to us to be about the best general elementary treatise on what the science of ethnology is about, and what its methods and outlook are, that we have yet seen. It digests and condenses an immense amount of original material</page><page sequence="13">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 479 published in monographs and books mostly not easily available, and often very dull reading if available, to the end of making plain for some eighteen examples how the "savage" actually lives. It is well written and illustrated. Each of the chapters has at the end a brief but well selected bibliography. There is an ex- cellent detailed index. Altogether we recommend this book without reservation to all students of human biology. Un- fortunately many of the half tone illus- trations are very badly reproduced. CLASSIFICATION AND USES OF FINGER PRINTS. (Seventh Edition). By Sir E. R. Henry. His Majesty's Stationery Office, London; The British Li- brary of Information, New York. 3 shill- ings net (Great Britain); 92. cents (New York). 81 x 51; iv + 142.; 1934. All you need to know about finger print- ing is contained in this the seventh edition of Henry's book. There is an interesting although brief resume of the history of finger printing and an account of some of the uses which have been made of finger prints. Directions for making prints are given, but the most of the book is devoted to description of the identifying charac- teristics and classification for filing. This latest revision of Henry's original system (which in turn is based on Galton's) makes it the most widely used system of classi- fication. THE DOCTOR AND CITIZENSHIP. By Thurman D. Kitchin. Christopher Publishing House, Boston. $i.5o. 8 x 54 89; 1934. A collection of short essays about the position of medicine in the community, by the President of Wake Forest College. Nothing new or startling is said, and very much that is trite, and for some time since unoriginal. We gather from the book that the author is a sound, genial, and conservative college president. ZOOLOGY IS IT CRUEL? A Study of the Condition of Captive and Performing Animals. By T. H. Gillespie. Herbert Jenkins, London. 6 shillings net. 84 x 52; i8z + i6 plates; 193 4. This is a book which will interest all animal lovers and bring solace to those who have deplored the captivity of wild animals. The author, director of the Zoblogical Park in Edinburgh, shows quite conclusively the advantages which a wild animal in captivity has over those that are unconfined, provided of course that the zoo is well kept. In the native state there is constant warfare carried on for the preservation of life. In the zoo, animals very soon adapt themselves to their cages which become to them a safe refuge and frequently develop a real affection for their keepers. A number of instances are cited of animals that, finding means of exit from their enclosures, were accustomed to roam the park at night but always returned before day-break to spend the day in confinement. The rhythmic pacing or movements of the body which so many animals exhibit in captivity Mr. Gillespie believes to be common among many wild animals whether captive or free and enjoyed by them in possibly the same way that the dance is enjoyed by human beings. The second section of the book is devoted to performing animals and the third and final section to the development of zo6logical parks. The volume contains a number of well-chosen illustrations and is indexed. ANATOMY OF ANIMAL TYPES for Students of Zoology. By E. A. Briggs. Angus and Robertson, Sydney. ios. 6d. 82 x 53; XiX + Z5o; 1934. This guide for the study of animal types, both invertebrate and vertebrate, will probably have little practical appeal for American zoologists since it concerns itself only with Australian forms. The book will undoubtedly find friends in Australia, however, for it seems quite complete, authoritative and clearly</page><page sequence="14">480 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY written. The author has purposely omit- ted using any drawings and diagrams holding the view, '.... that practical zoology is the study, not of drawings and diagrams, but of animal life in all its phases of structure and function.'' Whether it is desirable to omit illustra- tions in this case must be determined by the users of the volume. This conserva- tive reviewer however, used to seeing a picture of an Amoeba as he studied it, felt keenly the absence of drawings. Cfr COCCIDIA AND COCCIDIOSIS of Domesticated, Game and Laboratory Animals and of Man. By Elery R. Becker. Collegiate Press, Ames, Iowa. $.o. 5? 98 x 68; ix + I47; I934. Besides being based on the author's ex- tensive experimental investigations in the field, this book also embodies a digest of the related literature which runs to some 350 references. The work covers infor- mation on species, hosts, host-specificity, life cycle, pathogenicity, immunity, pro- phylaxis and therapeutics. There are twenty-five plates and text figures which are indispensable for identification and description. Three appendices contain: Recommended readings for coccidiosis in hosts not extensively treated in the text, a host-catalogue of genera of coccidia represented in the vertebrates, and notes on technique. There are both author and subject indices. TROPICAL FISHES for a Private Aquarium. By Christopher W. Coates. Liveright Pub- lishing Corp., New York. $1.00. 7 x 5; xi + 7 2.6; 1933. If you have ever had a gold fish you will like this book, although gold fish are not discussed. The foreword says that not all the fishes suitable for aquaria are listed, but there are over a hundred different species in the index, so that one ought to find a fish to meet almost any specifications. There are 57 excellent photographs. The first four chapters are concerned with gen- eral information about aquaria, care and feeding of fish, but the bulk of the book is devoted to descriptions of species suitable for pets. This is an excellent book since it not only contains valuable information but is delightful reading as well. THE ELASMOBRANCH FISHES. Third Edition. By J. Frank Daniel. University of Cali- fornia Press, Berkeley. $5.oo. io- X 6x ; xi + 33'-; '934. A third edition of this valuable zodlogical text revised by the addition of new ma- terial on the transformation of the endo- style into the thyroid gland; a more com- plete discussion of the lymphatic system; a consideration of the homologies of the carotid artery between Elasmobranchs and higher Vertebrates, and a report of new studies on the nature of the cells forming the wall of an ampulla of Lorenzini. KURZE ANwEISUNG FUR ZOOLOGISCH-SYS- TEMATISCHE STUDIEN. By Bernhard Rensch. Akademische Ver- lagsgesellschaft, Leipzig. 6.1o marks. 9x X 61; ii6 (paper). This is a most useful and clear discussion of the principles governing taxonomy and terminology. It is designed to explain briefly modern systematic categories and nomenclature to those who are specialists in other fields of biology, but need never- theless some understanding of systematic zoology. There is a final section of sound advice to the prospective Systematiker. The book is not over aden with examples and consequently makes easy as welt as highly instructive reading. INSECTS AS MATERIAL FOR STUDY. Two In- augural Lectures Delivered on I7 and 24 November I933. By G. D. Hale Carpenter. Oxford Uni- versity Press, New York. $i.oo. 9 x 6; 38; 1934 (paper). Two short essays, delivered as lectures, present the author's opinions as to the desirability of insect material for the study</page><page sequence="15">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 48I of biological problems. In general, Pro- fessor Carpenter is impressed with the insects as subjects to be used in analyzing problems of ecology and evolution. Of especial interest are the author's views as to the adaptive value of mimicry and protective coloration among insects and the relation of these phenomena to natural selection. THE TERRARIUM.

BOTANY THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF EXTRA- CHROMOSOMAL TYPES IN DATURA STRA- MONIUM. Carnegie Institution of Washing- ton Publication No. 45x By Edmund W. Sinnott, Helen Houghtaling and Albert F. Blakeslee. Carnegie Institu- tion, Washington, D. C. $i.5o (paper); $1.5o (cloth). io x 61; 5o+ I9 plates; I934' This quantitative analysis of the histo- logical characters of Datura mutants of known chromosomal constitution is prin- cipally concerned with the structure of the floral pedicel; the leaves of the various types were relatively constant in structure, the stem never really stops developing and comparable sections are hard to find, and the roots were too highly variable within one and the same type for comparison with other types. As might have been expected, the various polyploid types, in, zn, 3n, and 4n showed differences in cell and organ size corresponding to their chromosome content. The principal point of interest is the analysis of hetero- ploid types, diploid plants with a single extra chromosome. Primary mutants differ very little from the structure of diploid plants but secondary mutants tend to have vascular bundles which are dis- tinctly wider and greater in area than those of diploid. The differences between mutants were mostly of a quantitative character. Besides tables of data there are photomicrographs of representative flower stalks of each of the mutants. As the first histological study of plant hy- brids that is not limited to the F1 gen- eration this contribution deserves the attention of geneticists. THE FLORA OF ICELAND AND THE FAROES. By C. H. Ostenfeld and Johs. Grontved. Levin and Munksgaard, Copenhagen. D. Cr. 6. o. 78 X 5 8; xxiv + I95 + 1 maps; I934. The senior author finished the first half only of this descriptive manual before his death in I93 I and the work was completed by Johs. Grdntved of Copenhagen with the assistance of specialists on several of the difficult genera like Hieracium and Salix. It provides analytical keys for the identification of the vascular cryptogams and the seed plants of Iceland and the Fxroes, with notes on their distribution and on the colloquial names by which they are known to the inhabitants. There are maps to make the place names in- telligible, and there are glossaries and indices which make the book readily usable. It is interesting to note that about half of the genera are represented by only one species. This flora should be very useful to students of plant distribu- tion since many North American plants are represented. THE MYXOMYCETES.

The taxonomy of these forms presents con- siderable difficulty and since discrimina- tions between names and authorities neces- sarily must be made frequently it is a commendable thing to discuss the reasons for the choice as fully as the authors have. Considerable space is given to lists of synonyms and citations of the original descriptions. There is an index and a bibliography.

Stout. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3. 9 X 6; X + I I9 + 36 plates; 1934. The collections of daylilies at the New York Botanical Garden provided the ma- terial on which this manual is based. It describes the species and horticultural clones grown in this country in some detail and there are recommendations as to soils, treatment, and suitability for the garden. There are numerous photographs, four color plates reprinted from Addisonia, a key to species, and an index. Alto- gether it should be a very satisfactory book for horticulturists and gardeners. EPITOME OF BOTANY WITH QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. Part I. By G. A. Kapadia. G. A. Kapadia, Rothfield St., Broach, India. 8 annas. 74 X 47; 44; I933 (paper). This syllabus has about the same content and style as a well-bred student's notes on a lecture course on plant morphology. The principal object is to teach the student the names of the structures which have diagnostic value in classification. There is a short, unillustrated glossary of botan- ical terms, a list of Greek and Latin root-words, and a list of questions on the material covered in the booklet. Al- though this could be used to supplement a second-rate textbook profitably there would be no advantage in using it with a good textbook. A TEXTBOOK OF SYSTEMATIC BOTANY. Second Edition. By Deane B. Swingle. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York. $z.z5. 9 x 5; xv + Z70; I934. This is the second edition of a college text- book planned not only to teach students how to identify plants and to provide them with glossaries and diagrams to aid in interpreting the standard manuals, but also to introduce them to the logical principles underlying schemes of classifica- tion. Brief synopses are given of 6o fam- ilies of spermatophytes. There is an index and there are lists of reference books. MORPHOLOGY INTERCORTICAL SYSTEMS OF THE HUMAN CEREBRUM. Mapped by Means of New Anatomic Methods. By Joshua Rosett. Columbia University Press, New York. $3.00. 10 X 7; xvi + '35; I933. In this book the author describes his work in mapping out the intercortical nerve fibres by the ingenious method, devised by him, of dissecting the tissues along the natural lines of cleavage by exploding them with gas. Although much more work will have to be done before definite results can be obtained concern- ing special regions and functional mech- anisms, the work is important as orien- tation for further study. Adolf Meyer contributes a foreword and Stanley Cobb a preface.

PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY FEATURES IN THE ARCHITECTURE OF PHYSIO- LOGICAL FUNCTION. By Joseph Barcroft. The University Press, Cambridge; The Macmillan Co., New York. $5.50. 84 x 52; x + 368; I934. The argument that runs through this series of lectures is that the fundamental prin- ciples of human physiology are inter- dependent, that in a certain sense one principle implies the others. At the outset I had regarded the body as a noble building on the principles which it exhibits as un- connected features in its architecture. It became clear that the features were far from being inde- pendent. The highest functions of the nervous sys- tem demxnd a quite special constancy in the compo- sition of its intimate environment. The stability of the internal milieu almost compels the principle of the storage of materials and of integration in adaepta- tion. Again an easy stepping stone to integration in [is] the practice of the body to have more than one way of doing many things. But parallel mechanisms may express themselves not only in integrative but in antagonistic processes. Moreover, increased func- tion actively may 'e achieved either by heightening the efforts of units already functioning or marshalling a greater number of units; and so we arrive at the "all-or-none" relation. It seemed almost as though there had emerged an approach to physiology from an unusual angle: not from that of mere structure, whether the structure of organs or of chemical formulae, but from the princi- ples of ;function. This, then, is the outline of a thorough- going and critical review of quantitative evidence on which this series of proposi- tions rests presented skillfully in the form of lectures. It is an impressive chain of reasoning but it would be unfair to say that it makes easy reading; it requires care- ful study but it is worth it. Bibliog- raphies and an index are provided. STUDIES ON THE POSSIBLE INTOXICATING ACTION OF 3.2. PER CENT BEER. By A. J. Carlson, N. Kleitman, C. W. Muehlberger, F. C. McLean, H. Gullicksen and R. B. Carlson. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. 75 cents. 7x 58; vii + 85; 1934 (paper). A laboratory experiment designed to be helpful in a redefinition of alcoholic in- toxication in its social and legal aspects. The specific question to be answered was: Can sufficient beer containing 3.2. per cent alcohol be consumed to produce definite intoxication? The beer was given to human subjects under experimental condi- tions. The measurements taken were: Alcoholic concentration in blood and urine, a series of objective performance tests, and subjective judgments of change in behavior of the subjects by observers. The amounts of beer given were graded from two 12.-ounce bottles up to quantities taxing the capacity of the digestive tract with repetition of dosage at various time intervals and with and without food. A check test was carried out using near beer. The data are presented in tables, charts and correlation surfaces. A brief review of experiments dealing with intoxication is made, but an extensive comparison of the findings is impossible for lack of statistical data in previous studies. The authors found that forced consumption of 3 .2 per cent beer at the rate of 4 to 6 bottles per hour for three and one-half hours (IO9 cc.-I9o cc. of alcohol) produced intoxica- tion in five out of 2.9 cases. The average blood concentration of alcohol was i.2. milligrams per cc., which was within the range where 46 ler cent were found "under the influence ' or at the stage of "stimulation" by other investigators, and this concentration is below the limit of intoxication set by the British Alcohol Investigation Committee. The authors conclude that 3 .2 per cent beer is not in- toxicating, for the ordinary person cannot practically drink large enough quantities</page><page sequence="18">484 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY necessary to reach the required alcohol concentration in the blood. DISEASES PECULIAR TO CIVILIZED MAN. Clinical Management and Surgical Treatment. By George Crile. Edited by Amy Rowland. The Macmillan Co., New York. $5 .oo. 8 x 5a; xi + 427 + folding chart; I934. The principle enunciated here is that the high activity of the brain, the thyroid, and the adrenal-sympathetic system of civilized man gives him not only his unique power and distinction, but also his unique diseases, neurocirculatory asthenia, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer and prob- ably diabetes. Treatment of these hyper- kinetic syndromes includes one or more points of attack, the object in each case being to lessen the factors that are causing the damaging kinetic drive; thus the driv- ing power of the brain may be lessened by rationalization or by excision of the sym- pathetic ganglia, the driving power of the thyroid decreased by thyroidectomy or by interference with its sympathetic nerve supply by ligation, the hyperactivity of the adrenals by denervation. Of these possible points of attack, primary empha- sis is placed on adrenal denervation. Under this treatment, 94 per cent of 76 cases of true neurocirculatory asthenia, the same percentage of 79 cases of hyper- thyroidism, and 96 p)er cent of 37 cases of peptic ulcer, showed cure or improvement. Approximately the first one-third of the book deals with the development of the theory of the interrelated hyperkinetic activity of the brain-thyroid-adrenal-sym- pathetic system, clinical descriptions of the "diseases peculiar to civilized man" and the surgical technique of adrenal denervation. The remainder of the book is devoted to routine clinical histories of patients, most of whom were treated by adrenal denervation. Although joint au- thorship is not noted on the title page, parts of the book are contributed either by or with the assistance of five coworkers. In its entirety, however, the book reveals the boundless enthusiasm and unbridled optimism of the principal author. An extensive bibliography and name and subject indexes are included. LES ULTRAVIRUS. Pathogenes et Sapro- phytes. Techniques d'Etgde. Caracteres Physiques et Biologiques. Maladies A Ultra- virus. Clinique. Anatomo-Pathologie. Epi- demiologie. Jmmunite. By Paul Hauduroy. Masson et Cie, Paris. 6o francs. io x 61; 462.; I934 (paper). Although this might be called a second edition of the author's book Les Ultravirus et les Formes Filtrantes des Microbes pub- lished in I92.9 and noticed in these columns (Vol. 5, pp. 364-365) it is really a different work. Interest and research on the vi- ruses has advanced to such an extent as to add to, modify or negate much of the mate- rial presented in the previous work. The arrangement of the section dealing with specific viruses-those affecting bacteria, plants, fishes, insects, and birds as well as mammals-follows in the main that of the earlier work, but it has been entirely rewritten to conform with the knowledge which subsequent research has brought to light. The author has added a section on techniques as bases for further study, but has omitted the discussion of filtrable forms of non-filtrable germs, as he intends to devote another book to this phase. The book is well-written, well docu- mented and indexed, and should alto- gether make a worthy addition to the bacteriologist's library. L'IMMUNITE PAR MECANISME PHYSICO- CHIMIQUE. By R. Du]jarric de la Riviere. Masson et Cie, Paris. i8 francs. 91 x 61; 73; I934 (paper). For ten years the author has conducted numerous investigations to determine the physicochemical mechanism underlying immunity. In this volume he briefly sum- marizes the results of a few of his experi- ments as an illustration of the value of biochemical and biophysical methods and technique. The monograph is divided into three parts. In the first he reports the changes occurring in the antiseptic power of certain compounds through the action of ultraviolet radiation and in rela- tion to difference in electrolytic disassocia- tion. The second treats of the preciseness of the flocculation technique from which</page><page sequence="19">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 485 Ramon's work on diphtheria anti-toxin derives its importance. In the last and most extensive part the author demon- strates the function of the hemoglobin, adsorption and transportation of toxins and antitoxins, and in particular the effect of bismuth, ,arsenic and mercury com- pounds on the red blood cells of man (syphilitic and non-syphilitic) and other animals. DIET AND PERSONALITY. Fitting Food to Type and Environment. By L. Jean Bogert. The Macmillan Co., New York. $z.oo. 74 x 54; ix +2z2.3; I934. Advice as to what to eat and when to eat it is not lacking in the lives of most of us. Sensible advice, that which is free from superstitious prejudice or is not advanced for the commercial advantage of somebody and which takes any account whatsoever of individual differences is not however, accessible to a vast number of persons. In this book Doctor Bogert presents, in clear although somewhat breezy style, most of what the relatively new science of nutri- tion has to teach the practical man about his diet. In addition, as she says in the Foreword, "You may find that I have almost as much to say about general living conditions and health habits as about diet, but that is because no one can profit from a good diet as much as he shoufd, when his habits of living are wrong. TRAITE DE PHYSIOLOGIE NORMALE ET PATHOLOGIQUE. Tome VII. San(g et Lymphe. Re'actions d'Immunite. (Deux- ieme Edition). By Ch. Achard, Justin-Besangon, A. Bes- redka, Le'on Binet, J. Bordet, L. Cue'not, H. Delaunay, R. Fabre, J. Jolly, M. Laudat, Ph. PagnieZ, G.-H. Roger, E. Schulmann, P.-E. Weil, E. ZunZ. Published under the direction of G.-H. Roger and Le'on Binet. Masson et Cie, Paris. ioo francs (paper); i2o francs (cloth). 95 x 65; xii + 73I; I934- Since I927 when the first edition of this volume (noticed in these columns, Vol. 3, P. I43) of a useful reference work on physi- ology appeared research has increased the knowledge concerning blood and lymph to such an extent that the material had to be thoroughly revised and augmented to make the second editionup-to-date. Nota- ble additions include a chapter on the chemical constituents of blood written by M. Laudat, and one by L. Cuenot on the coagulation of the blood in the inverte- brates. A chapter by Edgard Zunz on coagulation has been substituted for Doyon's treatment of the subject which appeared in the first edition. The docu- mentation has likewise been brought up through I933 and the whole book is more than zoo pages longer than the earlier work. HOMMAGE A LA MEMOIRE DU PROFESSEUR JEAN CANTACUZENE. Tome I et 11. Masson ct Cie, Paris. 25o francs. ii x 7a; xv + 8zz; I934 (paper). Doctor Ion Cantacuzino was born in Rumania, completed his medical and bacteriological education in Paris, was connected for several years with the Pas- teur Institute, and for the last thirty-two years of his life occupied the Chair of Experimental Medicine in the Faculty of Medicine and the Institute of Pathology and Bacteriology in Bucharest. He died in January of this year. It was originally planned to present these two volumes of papers by his students and friends to him on the occasion of his seventieth birthday in November. The papers treat of bacteriological and pathological subjects. The list of con- tributors is a long and imposing one, but space permits us to mention only a few: A. Besredka, A. Boquet, A. Calmette, S. Metalnikov, L. Negre, P. Reiss, G. Teissier and A. Wadsworth. A short biography of Doctor Cantacu- zino and a list of his publications, i23 in number, are provided.

Editorial Board: Samuel T. Orton, John F. Fulton and Thomas K. Davis. The Williams @ Wilkins Co., Baltimore. $8.oo. 9 x 5x; xXi + 667; 1934. A series of papers by thirty-four well known contributors, on aspects of cerebral localization, presented at the thirteenth annual meeting of the Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Diseases on December 28-29, 193z. The volume is divided into three sections representing three different attacks on the problem. The first, the anatomical, indicates the structural differences of various parts of the cortex; the second section deals with the experimental aspect which points to- wards the variation in functional impor- tance of the same cortical area in animals of different phylogenetic levels. The third attack is from the standpoint of detailed clinical observation, particularly on people who have undergone lobectomies. THE HUMAN BODY. Its Structure and Activities and the Conditions of Its Healthy Working. By H. Newell Martin. Twelfth Edition, Thoroughly Revised by Ernest G. Martin. Henry Holt and Co., New York. $4.00. x 52; xv + 701; I934. The twelfth edition ot this excellent text- book follows the pattern of the preceding one but is augmented and modified in accordance with recent discoveries. It is as complete and clear an outline of human anatomy and physiology as could possibly be written for the college student. BIOCHEMISTRY THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF PLANT SAPS IN RELATION TO PHYTOGEOG- RAPHY. Data on Native Vegetation in its Natural Environment. By J. Arthur Harris. Compiled from Original Records and Edited by a Committee of Dr. Harris' Colleagues in the University of Minnesota. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis. $4.50. 9- x 6; vi + 339; I934. A unique situation is involved in the publi- cation of this volume. The laboratory records and field notes of the late J. Arthur Harris collected over a period of about eighteen years and hitherto unpublished have been collected and tabulated by men formerly associated with him, and are now offered to physiologically-minded ecolo- gists for interpretation. Professor Harris undertook a very extensive survey of the physico-chemical properties of the tissue fuids of representative plants from very diverse ecological habitats intending to "analyze the data from two standpoints: first, the extent to which the plant's adaptability to environment-as measured by its ability to vary the physico-chemical properties of its tissue fluids-is a factor in plant geography and the evolutionary proc- ess; and, second, the physical and chemi- cal properties of the environment as a determining factor in the distribution of plant forms." His data include depres- sion of the freezing point of the expressed sap and the osmotic pressure calculated therefrom; the specific electrical conduc- tivity, expressed in ohms; pH value, chlo- ride content and sulphate content; and for each plant the full scientific name and notes on its habitat. About ix,ooo such records are presented here in systematic fashion and the problem of indexing and cross-indexing and coding has been very nicely solved. There is no attempt at analysis or interpretation. There are, however, notes by Harris setting forth his objectives and explaining his methods, and there is a bibliography of the 44 papers he and his collaborators published on this subject. It seems to us that this undertaking is an interesting experiment in scholarship; at the death of a competent investigator a large amount of data, too important to be lost, falls into the hands of his literary executors. How can it best be used? This is one way of solving the problem; we are curious to see how it works out.</page><page sequence="21">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 487 A BIOCHEMICAL STUDY OF THE METABOLISM OF MENTAL WORK. Archives of Psychology No. 164. By Hyman Goldstein. Archives of Psy- chology, Columbia University, New York. $I.00. 9-. x 61; 57; I934 (paper). An important contribution to studies in physiological psychology. The work is divided into two sections: (i) Investiga- tions of tasks involving mental work with overt physical components (cancellation, intelligence test and tapping). The con- clusions drawn were that Increase of the physical component results in greater metabolic change as determined by the bio- chemical methods employed in this investigation, Increase of the mental component without increase of physical component does not result in greater metabolic change, as determined by the biochemical methods used in this study. (z) Investigation of tasks involving mental work with minimum physical component. These studies showed that Metabolic change, as determined by the bio- chemical methods of this investigation, does not differ significantly from that which occurs during "no work." In a discussion of the results obtained the author expresses the belief that If there are any effects produced by mental work per se upon the total metabolic activity, it is evident that the current biochemical methods, particularly those employed in this study, do not appear to be sufficiently sensitive to detect these effects. There may still be very intense biochemi- cal activity present in particular areas of the brain as a result of mental work with- out affecting the total body metabolism. The author presents the results of his experiments in tabular form and concludes with a literature list of 67 titles. HANDBUCH DER BIOLOGISCHEN ARBEITS- METHODEN. Lieferung 428.

The first of the papers describes the build- ings, stalls, and apparatus developed at the Agricultural Experiment Station at Durham, New Hampshire, for respiration and nutrition studies on cattle an dL horses. No one who has ever lived on a farm can fail to be impressed by the automatic mechanical device, described and illus- trated in detail, for the collection, removal, and storage of manure. The second paper describes two types of a differential calorimeter much better adapted for short time metabolism experi- ments on man and small animals than the older and more massive chambers which sometimes weighed fifteen times as much as the person being studied. Both papers are thorough and are well illustrated. THE CHEMISTRY OF THE HORMONES. By Benjamin Harrow and Carl P. Sherwin. Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., Batimore. $z.5o. 9 x 6; vii + ZZ7; 1934. A practical book for the laboratory worker who wishes to prepare active hormone fractions of a chemically pure hormone. The main emphasis is on the chemical procedure. However, of necessity, con- siderable biological information is woven into the very clearly written exposition. Historical information with reference to discoveries and development of techniques forms a secondary but interesting phase of the discourse. There is a chapter devoted to each of the following: Thyroid; para- thyroid; pituitary; adrenal; male, female and plant hormones; insulii; and secre- tion. Each chapter has its extensive list of references, and the volume is indexed by author and by subject. MEDIZINISCHE KOLLOIDLEHRE. Lieferungen Io und Ii. Edited by L. LichtwitZ, Raph. Ed.

Stanford Uni- versity Press, Stanford University, Calif. $s.oo. 8- x 6; viii + 558; I934. The third annual volume of this exceed- ingly useful review of selected topics in biochemistry is as well done as its prede- cessors. There is a good deal of flexibility in the choice of the subject matter treated; some topics are reviewed only biennially, and some less active fields are to be treated more infrequently still. Two subjects appear for the first time in this volume, reviews of the biochemistry of malignant tissues and of dentistry. INTRODUCTION TO PHYSIOLOGICAL CHEM- ISTRY. Third Edition. By Meyer Bodansky. John Wiley and Sons, New York. $4.oo net. 9 x 58; xi + 66X; I934. Many sections of the third edition of this excellent textbook have been revised to include new data which have appeared since the last edition. The discussions of the chemistry of enzymes, the regulation of gastric activity, muscle metabolism, the mineral requirements in nutrition, the vitamines, hormones, blood and other body fluids, have been enlarged.

Masson et Cie, Paris. ioo francs. io x 6y; 594,; I934 (paper). This is an exce lent, systematically, ar- ranged introduction to biochemistry. All the groups of compounds basic to plant and animal life are discussed, and technical instructions given. Although primarily intended for the use of physiologists, the biologist, physician, pharmacologist and chemist should find it a handy reference book. The index is very complete. SEX THE REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS OF THE MAR- QUIS DE SADE. By Geoffrey Gorer. Wishart and Co., London. 8s. 6d. net. 85 x 52; 264; I934. The portrait which Mr. Gorer draws of the Marquis de Sade is very different from the fabulous monster of tradition. De Sade was a radical in politics and an experimentalist in sex. In the former capacity he made influential enemies who used his sexual experiments as a pretext to ruin him. ... if de Sade on several occasions indulged in ab- normal pleasures, he also risked his life to save that of a woman who had caused him to be imprisoned for thirteen years; . . . if a psychologist has attached his name to a form of cruelty, he was actually an inveterate opponent of capital punishment. In his political writings de Sade escaped the uncritical optimism which led many of his contemporaries to look forward to an immediate establishment of Utopia. He had no illusions about the natural goodness of man, but he believed that with complete economic and sexual equality human conditions could be greatly bettered. He anticipated the views of Malthus on population, and the tolerance of the Danish penal code as regards sexual behaviour. As a writer on the psychology of sex de Sade was a pioneer in a significant field of human biology. Unfortunately, however important the study of the sexual perver- sions may be, its spectacular character has had the effect of drawing away the atten-</page><page sequence="23">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 489 tion of investigators of sexual psychology from the still more important study of normal sexual behavior. Mr. Gorer con- siders that Krafft-Ebing's definition of sadism as "sexual emotion associated with the wish to inflict pain and use violence" reflects a misunderstanding of de Sade's own viewpoint and that it would be pref- erable to use Schrenck-Notzing's term algolagnia for all activities in which sex and external pain are united and to "keep the word Sadism for the special group of instincts which de Sade was the first and almost the only person to describe and which constitutes by far his most impor- tant contribution to psychology." Mr. Gorer's proposed redefinition of sadism is "'the pleasure felt from the observed modifications on the external world pro- duced by the observer.... Like all human emotions this is ambivalent, and can be either constructive or destructive.'" In other words Mr. Gorer would equate sadism with the pleasure of self-expression. . . . there can be Sadistic satisfaction in painting a picture, but not in painting a house under another person's orders and following another person's taste; there can be Sadistic pleasure in killing a person, but not if that killing is ordered and independent of the killer. The book includes a foreword by J. B. S. Haldane and a bibliography covering four pages of books by and about de Sade, but unfortunately it lacks an index. GENEALOGY OF SEX. Sex in its Myriad Forms, from the One-Celled Animal to the Human Being. By Curt Thesing. Translated from the German by Eden and Cedar Paul. Emerson Books, New York. $5.oo. 81 x 5a; xii + 286; I934. This book on sex is interesting. Some biologists may consider it sensational and anthropomorphic, and some specialists (as specialists alone can do) will undoubtedly find factual errors within; nevertheless, the writings capture the interest of the reader and hold it. The author has collected a commendable number of natural history observations dealing with various be- havior reactions associated with sexual processes throughout much of the animal world. He has arranged the material in the form of a 'genealogy' in that he at- tempts to depict the development of the sex impulse and its consummation from primitive to complex forms. He discusses the sex secrets of spiders, squid, crayfish and toads with the same realistic enthusi- asm as he shows in dealing with the human organism. The book merits read- ing.

Blakiston's Son and Co., Philadelphia. $4.00 net. 7 X 58 x + 249; 1934. This book really is what the title says it is-recent work on sex physiology. A knowledge of the anatomy and hysiology of sex organs is assumed and the chief topic considered is the recent work on the sex hormones. There is no single list of references, but separate lists are given at the end of each chapter. The citations are much abbreviated, titles of the papers not being included. There is, however, an author index and a good subject index. BIOMETRY CONTINUOUS INVESTIGATION INTO THE MORTALITY OF ASSURED LIVES. Statistics for the Six Years 1924-1929.

Antonino Giuffre, Milano. L. 50. 92 x 62; xiii + 464; I934. This is one of a series of volumes on ele- mentary statistics published under the aus- pices of the Istituto Centrale di Statistica of Italy. It summarizes rather thoroughly, although often with ineffectual criticism, statistical applications in the field of biology: problems of growth, evolution, genetics, anthropology, somatic constitu- tion. The exposition is very clear and the bibliography complete. There is an index of eighteen pages. PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR MODES OF BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION IN CHIMPANZEE TO MULTIPLE-CHOICE PROB- LEMS. Comparative Psychology Monographs, Vol. IO, No. I, Serial No. 47. By Robert M. Yerkes. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. $i.5o. IO x 6X; io8; I934 (paper). Unfortunately the results of this interest- ing series of experiments can only briefly be given. Four sexually immature chim- panzees (3 female, i male) served as sub- jects in the experiments which were under- taken to determine "(a) whether, and if so under what conditions, solution of a cer- tain type of novel problem occurs sud- denly, as if by discovery and with insight; (b) optimal motivational conditions for problem solution; (c) whether adaptation to relational problems may be achieved in radically different ways, as by trial and error versus discovery." Of 2.4 problems 14 (58%) resulted in solution. In 6 of the I4 cases the error was abruptly elimi- nated after 3 or more mistakes. The remaining 8 successful adaptations were mostly achieved by "gradual approxima- tion to perfection of response." The experiments are given in detail together with their summary in tabular and graphic form. The author believes that the fol- lowing practically and theoretically sig- nificant generalizations are justified: (a) Motivational factors are of two sorts, barring intermediates and mixtures; (i) those which prima- rily influence general activity, interest, and alertness, and (X) those which affect specific responses. In this investigation the former appeared to be indispensable, whereas the latter were of slight or even negative value. (b) Given excellent general adaptation to the experimental situation and the experimenter, together with willingness to cooperate by making the circuit through the multiple-choice apparatus a certain number of times daily, marked stimulation by the use of motivational factors interfered with the solu- tion of relational problems by chimpanzee. (c) It is indicated that special rewards and deter- rents neither reenforced correct responses nor in- hibited incorrect responses, for the faitly obvious reason that the same response might be correct for one setting of the apparatus and incorrect for the next." The study concludes with a brief list of references. A FIELD STUDY OF THE BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL RELATIONS OF HOWLING MONKEYS. Comparative Psychology Monographs, Vol. IO, No. 2, Serial No. 48. By C. R. Carpenter. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. $z.i5. io x 68; i68; I934 (paper). The author spent about eight months studying howling monkeys in the Panama Canal Zone and in the Republic of Panama. Most of the intensive study was made on the Island of Barro Colorado, where it was possible to keep groups under observation day after day. The howling monkeys live in clans vary- ing in size from four to 3 5 individuals. A clan tends to occupy a definite and limited territory through which it moves in refer- ence to lodge and food trees at about the rate of eight hundred yards per day. The males usually lead the group and when they encounter potential danger, or other groups of howlers, noisy vocal battles result and the group soon shifts its course</page><page sequence="25">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 49I to avoid contact. The author sometimes met with howls and bluff, often accom- panied with showers of sticks and dung, before flight or indifference was shown. Among adults in a group the sex ratio is approximately z8 per cent males to 72. per cent females. Mating is apparently communal with some preference among individuals. The males are peaceful and cooperative toward all members of the clan. At times single males become sepa- rated from a clan and frequently when these complemental males attempt to join a strange group they are driven away temporarily by vigorous vocalization. The young are infants in arms for about one month, then they ride their mother's hip until nearly a year old. During the second year the young follow the mother more or less closely. The young are weaned and the tendency for play is at its height. Toward the end of the third year play habits decline, sexual development takes place and the young become sober old monkeys. There are sixteen pages of illustrative plates, a bibliography of 74 titles, and an index to this very interesting study of monkey society. THE PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY OF SENSATION. By Charles Hartshorne. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $3.00. 9 x 6; xiv + z88; 1934. Here we have presented to us the theory of the Affective Continuum which, according to the author, is the foundation of inter- sensory resemblances. It implies that whatever qualities exist can b, related as variables intersecting in the same system. It also implies that qualities of human experience correspond in some degrees to the qualities of neural and somatic cellular experiences which by the bond of sympathy which is the psycho-physical relation, form their physiological conditions." A characteristic example will render the meaning clearer: "the smell of a skunk-which in moderate intensity may be enjoyed -is a bitter like smell, a bitterness differently spatial- ized from that of the taste of strychnine, but plainly akin to it." The greater part of this work deals especially with visual and auditory sensa- tions. Aside from minor inaccuracies such as that the wave-length of the visible spectrum is from 400 to 8oo millimeters, we are introduced to a derivation of the affec- tive continuum, e.g.,, "the brightness of highly pitched sounds." The author affirms that if this fact and its implications had been seriously considered by physiolo- gists, the Wever-Bray phenomenon would have been discovered long ago. Not being a philosopher we cannot understand how nor where the author derives the erroneous assertions that nobody is deaf to the brightness range (the upper limit of which is apparently regarded by the author as 8oo cycles). From the viewpoint of an empiricist, the examples given above, together with the statement that some of the evidence discussed is based only on intuition, the disregard of experimental data and last but not least the appendix on the applicability of the affective continuum to theology, are sufficient to classify this book as an at- tempt to reduce psychology to its primi- tive sterile status. In our opinion the author achieves clearness of language and expression only in discussing matter of his own specialty and we find worthy of par- ticular praise his pages on aesthetics. WHO SHALL SURVIVE? A New Approach to the Problem of Human Interrelations. By J. L. Moreno. Nervous and Mental Disease Publishing Co., Washington. $4.00. 9R9 x 6; xvi + 440; 1934. The student of human relations will find this an interesting book. The author first experienced the need for some definite method of social and psychological plan- ning when a member of a staff which was supervising a group of io,ooo Austrians of Italian extraction who were moved during the World War from their homes in the southern Tyrol to a place near Vienna. The throwing together of such a large group, unselected, unaccustomed to the environment, and unadjusted within them- selves produced great unhappiness and friction. To bring about a better social adjustment within this group Dr. Moreno began his first experiments in sociometric planning, later carrying on and extending</page><page sequence="26">492. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY and refining his methods among groups in this country, chiefly in public and train- ing schools in and near New York City. He has also been concerned with the psychological planning of communities for the Department of the Interior. Briefly, socionomy is a science which is concerned with the psychological properties of popu- lations and with the communal problems which these properties produce. Sociom- etry is the mathematical study of these psychological properties. The amount of organization shown by social groups is measured by the sociometric test. By means of this test an individual can make his choice, without restraint, for member- ship in the group for which he is best fitted. In one of the last sections in the volume the writer discusses the importance of maintaining the spontaneability of the in- dividual which requires the concentration of all agencies-technological, psycholog- ical an eugenic. The experimental work is illustrated by numerous charts and graphs. Further notes, a glossary, and a bibliography are included in a series of supplements. The volume is indexed. 7- THE BEHAVIOUR OF ANIMALS. An Introduc- tion to its Study. By E. S. Russell. Longmans, Green and Co., New York. $4.zo. 8 x 5x ; viii + I84; I934. A book which cannot fail to interest its readers. It should be in all biological as well as general libraries. For the general reader interested in natural history no better introduction to the study of animal behavior has appeared. Likewise all students intending to specialize in this line of work will find it valuable reading. Stress is placed on the importance of regarding the animal as an entity rather than stuaying it as a mere bundle of mech- anisms responding to stimuli, on observing and recording fully and accurately an animal's behavior in its daily activities, not only what is unusual but even the sim- plest responses. The author believes that much valuable knowledge of animal be- havior is possessed by game keepers, shepherds, Soog breeders, etc. which the protessional student has generally ignored. He does not find Roule's theory that the salmon, when ready to spawn seeks in- creased quantities of dissolved oxygen in fresh water streams, sufficient to explain why this species seeks a particular estuary or a particular stream which at its mouth frequently contains heavily polluted water which it must pass through before reach- ing the fresher water. The volume is adequately illustrated, each chapter is well documented and there is an index. YOU MUST RELAX. A Practical Method of Reducing the Strain of Modern Living. By Edmund Jacobson. Whittlesey House, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York. $I.50. 7 x 5; xv + ZOI; I934. A "handy" book (third printing), based on the author's earlier work Progressive Relaxa- tion, whereby Americans can keep up their fast pace of living without too great a strain on the system. Dr. Jacobson, of the University of Chicago, has for many years devoted his attention to neuro- muscular tensions and the disabilities which they produce. He has developed a method of relaxation which he strongly recommends to all those who, while physically fit, suffer from exhaustion, insomnia, or nervousness of one kind or another. He gives detailed instructions on how to relax properly even while being active. Progressive relaxation under his system frequently brings improvement where there is no organic disease in cases of indigestion and colitis and he believes that some advancement is being made by the same method in the little understood field of hypertension. Written expressly for the layman the volume is devoid of technicalities. It contains a number of illustrations but is without index. \,&amp; MECHANISMS OF HANDEDNESS IN THE RAT. Comparative Psychology Monographs, Vol. 9, No. 6, Serial No. 46. By Geo. M. Peterson. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. $i.2S. io x 6Q; 67; i934 aper). Right an left handedness seem to occur in</page><page sequence="27">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 493 about equal numbers with rats, the ambi- dexterity occurring less frequently than either of the other conditions. Handed- ness seems to be a stable characteristic though relatively complex. Chance use or previous experience cannot entirely account for the trait for ambidextrous animals do not acquire a fixed preference for one hand after a greater amount of forced practice with that hand. Seven generations of inbreeding were insufficient to establish a simple Mendelian mech- anism for the inheritance of the trait. Cerebral localization of handedness lies in the frontal area of the contralateral hemi- sphere. Destruction amounting to less than 4 per cent of the area of one hemi- sphere will lead to transfer in the prefer- ential use of the hands. Twenty pages of appendices give the tabulated test data, and two pages of Slates give z8 diagrams of local cerebral estruction relative to certain rats under test. There is a bibliography of Z3 titles. INTRODUCTION TO PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOL- OGY. By Graydon LaV. Freeman. Ronald Press Co., New York. $4.50. 8 x 5; xvii + 579; I934. One is tempted to characterize this book as psychology in terms of axial gradients. But that is hardly fair as it would seem to imply that the author is riding a hobby which is not the case. There is more of what is generally taught as biology than is usual in a psychology text. This is to be expected from the author's definition: "'the field of physiological psychology covers these investigations and interests which lie between psychology, physiology, and neurology, and which are not para- mount to any one of them. It is, in a sense, a hybrid, like physiological chem- istry, and serves to emphasize the essential continuity of the sciences." The book is divided into four main divisions: Basic neural mechanisms in behavior, Structuro-functional organiza- tion of neural mechanisms, and Integrative action of neural mechanisms, and neural mechanisms and variable behavior. There are selected references at the ends of the chapters as well as the regular literature citations given in foot-notes. The index includes both authors and subjects. KEEPING A SOUND MIND. By John J. B. Morgan. The Macmillan Co., New York. $z.oo. 7A x 5; ix + 440; I934. This book puts the findings of psycholo- gists and psychiatrists on menta hygiene into non-technical language for the benefit primarily of college students. Its view- point is that mental health depends in Iarge part on the formation of certain mental habits and the elimination of cer- tain others. The chief factor which leads in extreme cases to the functional mental diseases and in less extreme cases to un- happiness and inefficiency is the refusal in one form or other to face reality. Partic- ularly dangerous is .the habit of blaming others for our failures. The ascetic ide- ology which assumes that to be meri- torious an activity must be distasteful is also the cause of much maladjustment. "Modern researches have demonstrated that work is man's best friend. It is a means of prophylaxis against mental dis- ease and a therapeutic agent for effecting cures." The book contains a two-page list of references for further reading and an index. INTRODUCTION TO COMPARATIVE PSYCHOL- OGY. By Carl J. Warden, Thomas N. Jenkins and Lucien H. Warner. Ronald Press Co., New York. $4.50. 8 x x + 58i; I934. This is an excellent reference or text-book, bringing together widely scattered mate- rial on the behavior of infra-human organisms. The present volume is an abridged and simplified edition of a larger and more detailed work by the same authors to be called Comparative Psychology. The first six chapters are somewhat gen- eral, giving historical background, general aspects of behavior and methods of testing capacities. The last I4 chapters are devoted to the description of the reactions of the different phyla.

Although that particular sub- ject fares pretty poorly, the book is a store- house of information. There are subject and author indices. CIVILIZED LIFE. The Principles and Appli- cations of Social Psychology. A Revision and Enlargement of Social Psychology, i92S. By Knight Dunlap. The Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., Baltimore. $4.00. 82 x ix + 374; I934 This is a revised and enlarged edition of the author's Social Psychology, which was noticed in Volume i, page 137 of this REVIEW. Chapters have been added on desire, race and civilization, and the child as a member of the group. Professor Dunlap intends to elaborate the topics of the family, religion, and politics in sepa- rate treatises which will deal with them in more detail than is possible in the pres- ent book. An index and an annotated bibliography, in which he tells-some- times quite pungently-what he thinks of the books cited, are included. DE OMNIBUS REBUS ET QUJIBUSDEM ALIIS CLARET and the White Wines of Bordeaux. By Maurice Healy. Constable and Co., London. 5 shillings net. 78 x 47; I65; '934. This volume well maintains the high standard set by the earlier volumes of the Constable Wine Series. The grands vins of Bordeaux are, at their best, the superla- tively best examples of God's major gift to the gustatory and associated senses of mankind. [Reginald the Office Boy says this is too strong a statement, likely to lead some paranoiac weaned on Burgundy or Rioja to shoot up the office. He is wrong. We have understated the facts. And in any case magnanimity and reasonableness are our strong points. Should any one feel an urge to prove to us by example that there are better wines than the best of Bordeaux, here we are, ready and waiting. No more willing guinea pig ever offered himself for experimentation 1] Mr. Healy knows his clarets and sau- ternes, and rates them, on the whole, very fairly and justly. He describes the proc- esses of their growth and manufacture in considerable detail, and gives excellent advice about buying, storing, and serving them. Naturally the bulk of the book goes to the red wines. There isn't much that can be said about a Chateau Yquem of a great year except to be as lyrical as your powers permit, once and for all, and then maintain a reverend peace. It is good to talk about wine, yes, but still better to drink it. There are some odd biological facts and problems about Bordeaux wines that Mr. Healy touches upon. One of them com- pletely floored Pasteur, by his own admis- sion, after a considerable struggle. ATTENDING MARVELS. A Patagonian Journal. By George G. Simpson. The Macmillan Co., New York. $3.00. 91 x 6T; xiii + Z95 + i5 plates; I934 . This is an extremely entertaining book. The author, Associate Curator of Verte- brate Paleontology at the American Mu- seum went to Patagonia to collect fossils, where they grow weird ones for reasons that he makes quite plausible even to those not nurtured on geology. The first thing he did was to run head on into a lively sort of revolution, barely escaping serious con- sequences. Then with a truck and as- sorted helpers as time went on he ranged over the pampas, certainly one of the most literally God-forsaken countries in which civilized human beings habitually move and have their beings. The essence of Patagonia is wind-lots of it. Air in a tremendous hurry to get somewhere else, in short. And worse, this aerial urge is so nearly perennial as to make no matter. The author writes both vividly and logically. The result is an amazingly good book, that tells the reader what he really wants to know about the physiog- raphy, fauna, flora, the people and their manners and customs, the history, con- fection and virtues of the national drink yerba mate, and a thousand other things. The book is well illustrated with photo- graphs, but unfortunately lacks an index.</page><page sequence="29">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 495 THE PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS OF LEIBNIZ. Everyman's Library Volume No. 9os. Selected and Translated by Mary Morris. E. P. Dutton and Co., New York. go cents. 61 x 44; xxxiii + 284; I934. This Everyman's Library edition of selec- tions from Leibniz's philosophical writings includes the Monadology; Prin- ciples of Nature and of Grace, Founded on Reason; and On the Ultimate Origination of Things. These are given complete. In order to show the development of Leibniz's philosophy extracts are also given from his correspondence with Foucher, Arnauld, Bayle and Clarke, and from his Exposition and Defence of the New System and New Essays on the Human Understanding. Finally in order "to illus- trate the breadth and variety of Leibniz's interests, and also his attitude to other men of learning of his time," a number of miscellaneous extracts from his writings are selected. The book includes an in- troduction by C. R. Morris, a biblio- graphical note, an annotated index of proper names, and a philosophical index. SEVEN FAMOUS NOVELS BY H. G. WELLS. The Time Machine. The Island of Dr. Moreau. The Invisible Man. The War of the Worlds. The First Men in the Moon. The Food of the Gods. In the Days of the Comet. By H. G. Wells. Alfred A. Knopf, New York. $2.75. 81 x 52; xi + 86o; I934. H. G. Wells started what may properly be called his career as a biologist. He has never wholly forsaken the outlook and habits of thought indoctrinated in the South Kensington laboratory. Many of his readers feel that the seven novels here reissued are, taken as a lot, the best work he has ever done. They are, in the order of this edition, The Time Machine; The Island of Dr. Moreau; The Invisible Man; The War of the Worlds; The First Men in the Moon; The Food of the Gods; In the Days of the Comet. They are, one and all, biological romances au fond, and no one without training in biology can get the full savour of them. The publisher has done a real service in making these stories readily available in beautiful format and at an amazingly low price. SIXTH REPORT OF THE UNITED STATES GEOGRAPHIC BOARD, I890 to I93Z . U. S. Government Printing Office, Wash- ington. 8o cents. 98 x 587; ix + 834; I933 (paper). This report contains all important de- cisions made by the Board from I890 up to June I93z. There is an interesting dis- cussion of the problem of making names, and an equally interesting account of the history of the organization. Pages 76-834 are devoted to an alphabetical list of foreign and national geographical names approved by the Board. </page></plain_text>
