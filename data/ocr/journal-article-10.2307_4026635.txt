<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Lyon and Phillip R. Sloan, From natural history to the history of nature. Notre Dame and London: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981. Pp. xiv + 406. J91 1.95. David Goodman, Buffon's Natural History. (The Open University Arts: A Second Level Course, The Enlightenment.) Milton Keynes: The Open University Press, 1980. Pp. 74. Apart from the works under review, there have been several recent collections of selections from Buffon, including the extracts from the Natural History edited by Frank N. Egerton (Arno Press, New York, 1977) and the selections from the Natural History of the Birds and the Natural History of Oviparous Quadrupeds, edited by K. B. Sterling (Arno Press, New York, 1978); and Buffon has recently been much biographized and analyzed. This attention isn't simply a measure of Buffon's importance (why is there no comparable Linnaeus bonanza?), but registers the fact that Buffon is both an enigma, yet a very accessible one. Man of the Enlightenment or not? Profound naturalist or popularizer? Defender or destroyer of the idea of species? All these issues can be debated precisely because Buffon was</page><page sequence="2">322 Book Reviews such a stylist, who ensured that his thought-however perplexing-was at least readily readable. Which Buffon do we find in these two teaching aids, introducing students to the texture of his thought? David Goodman's thoughtful way-in gives us a Buffon notable for its concentration on theories of the earth and dynamic notions of terrestrial development. John Lyon and Phillip Sloan for their part offer a similar perspective. Their introduction casts Buffon as lynch-pin in the transition 'from natural history to the history of nature' (a notion also recently canvassed by Lepenies, rooted in Roger and Lovejoy, and deriving ultimately from Kant); and they give a valuable discussion of the Leibnizian origins of Buffon's conception of time and space as active processes, reproducing to illustrate this translations of Buffon's 'Initial Discourse' and his 'Second Discourse', both dating from 1749. Well and good. Yet, weirdly, what is slipping through the scholarly net is precisely what Buffon's contemporaries surely read him for: his descriptions of animals. Are they perhaps felt to be an academic liability, as though they can hardly be touched by scholars without embarrassment, their depictions-anthro- pomorphic, sentimental, moralistic, rhetorical being too redolent of the old bestiaries. They perhaps illustrate very well the aperqu of Keith Thomas in his Man and the Natural World (Harmondsworth, 1983) that anthropomorphism, though expelled through the door, was always making its way back in through the window. It is certainly time to face the Buffon who admired dogs for having 'no ambition, no interest', and who loathed cats for being 'knaves, servile and flattering', who 'conform to the habits of society but never to the manners', and amounted to nothing more than creatures of 'habitual wickedness'.
