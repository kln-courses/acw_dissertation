FITZPATRICK Lecturer in Philosophy, St Patrick's College, Manly, New South Wales THE ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF EVIL Faced with the problem of evil, theistic philosophers, in their endeavour to show that religious belief is coherent and tenable, usually produce an argument running along the following lines: The presence of evil in the world is justified by the fact that some evils are positively required for the achievement of a certain good (or, perhaps, certain goods) which God wants to achieve; and this good is of such great value as to make the evils which we encounter well worth enduring. Since, then (so the argument goes), the evils of this world are necessary conditions for the attainment of much greater good, God is justifed in permitting their occurrence. This theistic argument has a long and distinguished history, particularly in Christian apologetics. Perhaps its most celebrated formulation is that given by St Augustine: 'Since God is the highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil.'1 This Augustinian formulation of the argument was later endorsed by St Thomas Aquinas and utilised by him in his own attempt to deal with the problem of evil.2 Contemporary theists have also made much use of this general line of argument: Professor P. T. Geach, for instance, in his work Providence and Evil, claims that 'God permits sin only because he wills to produce a kind of virtue that stands in internal relation to the sin; virtue that is exercised in opposition to the sin or for the redemption of the sinner, and thus logically could not exist if the sin did not '.3 Of course, the philosopher who tries to tackle the problem of evil in this way is obliged to explain (or, at least, to suggest) exactly how the evils of this world are required if greater good is to be achieved. The mere statement of the general principle involved - that evil may bejustified if it is a necessary condition for greater good - is clearly not enough: an atheist may quite happily accept the principle but contend that it is inoperative in this case, since the evils which actually exist are not, in fact, required for greater good. If he is to solve the problem of evil, the theist must be able to specify the nature of the good which justifies evil, and to show that the connection 1 St Augustine, Enchiridion, xi. 2 St Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, ia, ii, 3, ad 2um. 3 P.

FITZPATRICK between the evils of this world and the justifying good is an absolutely necessary one. I The particular twists and turns which arguments of this sort may exhibit are not, however, my chief concern in this paper. I wish instead to emphasize an aspect of these controversies which has not generally been recognized, namely, that any actual employment (in either a theistic or an atheistic argument) of the principle 'Evil is justifiable if it is a means to greater good' relies on certain important presuppositions concerning the scope and limits of human knowledge; and, I shall argue, these presuppositions are open to question. Probably the most penetrating examination of the issues involved here has been carried out by Fr M. B. Ahern in his book The Problem of Evil, a work which was published in I97I and has not, to my mind, received the attention it deserves. In this paper I propose to examine the argument presented by St Augustine and others and to assess its value as a weapon in the armoury of theistic apologetics; and in this discussion I shall rely heavily on Fr Ahern's treatment of the topic. If my appraisal of Ahern's position is correct, his argument is defective at one crucial point, although this deficiency can be remedied and the conclusion he reaches adequately defended. Ahern claims that discussions of the problem of evil have frequently been vitiated by a failure to distinguish between a number of different problems, each of which may legitimately be called 'a problem of evil'. To specify these different kinds of problems he distinguishes, first of all, between general and specific problems of evil, and, secondly, between abstract and concrete problems of evil. These two distinctions are made on the basis of different fundamenta divisionis, and therefore cut up their subject matter (i.e. the variously formulated 'problems of evil') in different ways: so, Ahern says, one formulation of the problem of evil is the general problem; and of the others - the specific problems of evil - some are abstract and some are concrete. What does this classification of' problems of evil' amount to? Well, Ahern maintains, 'the problem of evil', as traditionally expressed -- as, that is, it has been formulated by philosophers throughout the years, from Epicurus in the fourth century B.C. to contemporary writers on the subject - has been very much a general problem, in the sense that it has concerned the possibility of rationally affirming the existence of an all-powerful and perfectly good God if there exists any evil whatsoever: the issue, in other words, has been whether the joint assertion of (i) the existence of God, as traditionally conceived in Judaeo-Christian belief, and (ii) the existence of any evil at all, regardless of its nature, its intensity or its distribution, yields a contradiction. In support of his contention that the formulation of the problem has usually been of</page><page sequence="3">ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ON EVIL 2I this general sort, Ahern cites a wide range of such formulations by thinkers from different historical periods. Hume, for instance, poses the problem in the following words: Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?' And a contemporary writer, Professor H. J. McCloskey, sees the problem in much the same light: The problem of evil is a very simple problem to state. There is evil in the world; yet the world is said to be the creation of a good, omnipotent God. How is this possible? Surely a good omnipotent God would have made a world which is free from evil of any kind.' McCloskey says explicitly that it is the existence of evil of any kind which is sufficient to get the problem of evil going; but clearly the same conception of the problem is present in Hume's mind also, since Hume expounds the problem simply in terms of the presence of evil in the world, without adverting to different sorts of evils or to their intensity or spread of distribution throughout the world. The general problem of evil, then, is the problem of whether God's existence can be reconciled with the existence of any evil at all; and I think we must agree with Ahern that this is the way in which the problem has traditionally been presented. But, Ahern points out, evils are of different sorts, occur with a greater or lesser degree of intensity, and may be more or less widespread. The principal kinds of evils, he says, are: (I) moral evils, involving the free choices and acts of intelligent agents; (2) physical evils, i.e. evils affecting the constitution or functioning of physical organisms; and (3) psychological evils, or evils affecting the psychological states of conscious beings: Pain, emotional disturbances, etc., are clear examples. Now, an evil of any of these three kinds may be more or less intense, and may occur more or less frequently throughout the whole of the world, or only in certain parts of it. And the fact that there are these variations in type, intensity and distribution between different evils means that the general problem of evil is not the only such problem: over and above this general problem there are an indefinite number of specific problems, each of them concerned with whether the existence of God would be compatible, not just with the existence of evil tout court, but with the presence of such-and-such kinds of evils, occurring in such-and-such a number of cases, and in such-and-such degrees of intensity. So far, then, we have the distinction between the general problem and the 1 D. Hume, Dialogues Concerning .Natural Religion, part x (quoted in M. B. Ahern, The Problem of Evil (London, 197 1), p. 3). 2 Quoted in Ahern, op. cit. p. 3.</page><page sequence="4">22 F. J. FITZPATRICK specific problems of evil; but Ahern states further that the specific problems themselves may be either abstract or concrete. The problems described in the paragraph above are all abstract, in the sense that they are concerned with the possibility of some good's existing to justify various evils (classified by type, degree of intensity and multiplicity or spread of distribution), none of which may actually exist. The specific concrete problems, on the other hand, are concerned with the real existence of good to justify the evils which are actually present in the world. The concrete problems are typically of the form: Given that evil of such-and-such a type, degree and distribution might conceivably be justified by subsequent good, is there actually good available which will justify this particular instance of that variety of evil? Expressed in this way, it is clear that a given specific concrete problem can be raised only if the corresponding specific abstract problem has already been resolved in the affirmative: the concrete problem asks whether the potentialjustification of evil specified in the solution to the corresponding abstract problem is (or will be) not just potential but actual. As Ahern says, 'Good which, if it existed, could justify the evil, may never actually exist. Because the abstract problems are fundamentally independent of all matters of fact, they can go no further. They are concerned, not with whether evil is in fact justified, but with whether, if evil exists, it could be justified. They require no discussion of whether good to justify evil does exist. " Of course, Ahern realises that the detailed drawing of this threefold distinction between the general problem, the specific abstract problems and the specific concrete problems will prove to have been a labour in vain if it can be shown that the first of them, the general problem, tells decisively against the theist's position. If, that is, it can be shown that a contradiction is involved in supposing both that God exists and that there is evil in the world - any evil, regardless of its nature or intensity or spread of distribution - then it would obviously be pointless to ask whether God's existence is compatible with specific types of possible evil, or with particular specimens of evil in the world. The distinction is of no real importance unless this first hurdle can be surmounted. II In approaching the general problem of evil, Ahern investigates the ways in which we ordinarily try to justify the commission or permission of evils by human beings. In general, he says, evil can be justified only by good; that is, a human being is justified in not preventing, or (sometimes) in actually bringing about, some evil state of affairs only if that evil state of affairs is a necessary condition for the achievement of some good which clearly outweighs the evil in value and makes the endurance of it worthwhile. At least, this is 1 Ahern, op. cit. pp. 7-8.</page><page sequence="5">ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ON EVIL 23 the case with non-moral (physical and psychological) evils; for it is commonly believed, especially among Christians, that the direct commission (as distinct from the deliberate non-prevention) of a moral evil - 'doing evil that good may come', as St Paul describes it - is never, under any circumstances, justifiable, no matter how worthwhile or admirable the good to be gained thereby. On the other hand, there are certainly cases where we are justified in not acting to prevent somebody's performing a morally evil action, because such intervention on our part would make certain immensely valuable goods unrealisable. Ahern provides an apt example: ' . . . parents sometimes allow their children to do things, e.g. join one of the Forces, or go overseas alone, although they believe that new moral challenges will not always be met successfully by them. Absolutely speaking, they could prevent this moral failure, but they believe that failure, as well as other circumstances, may itself be the occasion of moral growth which could not otherwise occur.'1 There are, then, conditions under which human beings may be justified in not preventing, or in actually producing, non-moral evils, as well as in not preventing moral evils. These conditions, Ahern says, are as follows: (i) that the evil state of affairs brought about is apt to produce good which clearly outweighs the evil; and (2) that the good cannot be achieved without the evil, in any way possible for the agent.2 Ahern mentions that on occasions a third condition is commonly thought to apply, namely, that the agent who inflicts the evil should have at least the tacit consent of the person who suffers it; but he recognises that there are many cases in which this third condition does not hold, so that the only conditions that are invariably required for thejustification of evil are the two cited above. In applying these two conditions to God we must make some additional specifications. In particular, the second condition - that the good cannot be achieved without the evil, in any way possible for the agent - must be given a concrete meaning in the case where God is the agent concerned; for God, as theists have traditionally conceived him, is an omnipotent being, free from the limitations of power which severely restrict the scope of action of his creatures. If omnipotence is defined as the ability to do or bring about anything at all, provided it is intrinsically possible, then this second condition, when applied to God, states that the non-moral evils which he permits or directly brings about, as well as the moral evils which he allows to take place, must be absolutely necessary for the achievement of the goods which he wants to produce.3 ' Ahern, op. cit. p. 28. 2 Ahern, op. cit. p. 29. 3 This definition of omnipotence raises several issues which cannot be adequately treated in this paper. A couple of remarks should, however, be made on aspects of the definition which may be controversial.</page><page sequence="6">24 F. J. FITZPATRICK, Now, it is at least conceivable that certain evils may be required, by absolute necessity, if God's plan for the world is to be fulfilled. Moreover, there seem to be some goods of the highest value which could not exist unless they were occasioned by evil; Ahern points to mercy and forgiveness as examples of goods which no power, not even God, could produce unless there were some antecedent evil, and adds: 'Some virtues, such as fortitude, could be fully developed, it seems, only through an element of trial by evil of some kind. Personal faith and trust in God could grow in certain ways only through the testing of faith and trust in God's total goodness and power occasioned by evil. Benevolence towards others suffering evil supposes evil. '1 Clearly, then, since it has been shown that there are some evils which God must permit if certain enormously worthwhile goods are to be produced, there cannot be any contradiction between the presence of evil as such in the world and the existence of God; and this means that the general problem of evil has been solved. What, however, of the specific. problems? Granted that there is no contradiction between the existence of God and the presence of evil as such, is there not a contradiction involved in accepting both God's existence and the existence of the particular kinds, degrees and multiplicities of evils which are present in the world? Is not, for example, the amount of apparently pointless suffering which takes place totally inexplicable on the supposition that an omnipotent and perfectly good God exists? Admittedly, we can imagine situations in which human beings would be justified in not preventing evils of great intensity from taking place (for instance, someone's refusing to volunteer information which would, if known to the enemy, destroy his country's war effort, even though the withholding of that information means that innocent hostages will be brutally tortured and murdered), but we cannot simply conclude from these cases to thejustification of such evils where God is the agent concerned; for the limitations of power which restrict the range of actions open to human beings simply do not apply in the case of God. (i) The strictures of Professor Geach (in Providence and Evil and elsewhere) against the notion of omnipotence seem to be based on the fact that God cannot be said to do certain things (particularly evil acts such as breaking promises) which are nevertheless intrinsically possible. But if we analyse 'God can do X' as 'If God chooses to do X, He will do X', then we can say that God is, after all, able to do these things (i.e., he has the power to do them if he chooses) but that because he is infinitely good he will never, in fact, choose to do them. In any case, even if the notion of omnipotence does turn out to be incoherent, the rival notion of almightiness, which Geach accepts, is close enough to that of omnipotence to be equally serviceable in the formulation of the problem of evil (cf. Providence and Evil, pp. 4-5). (2) The above definition of omnipotence is formulated in terms of absolute (rather than logical) necessity because I reject the view that logical necessity is the only kind of necessity. On the contrary, in my view, the notion of absolute necessity encompasses necessity of both the analytic and the synthetic a priori kinds. Obviously, if there are synthetic a priori necessities, such as that no object can simultaneously have two different colours over its entire surface, then God can no more change these truths to falsehoods than he can suspend the law of non-contradiction or bring it about that some bachelors are married. Acceptance of non-logical necessity is doubtless a controversial move, but attempts in recent times to do away with the synthetic a priori have, I believe, consistently failed. I Ahern, op. cit. p. 32.</page><page sequence="7">ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ON EVIL 25 In order to show conclusively that God's existence is compatible with the varieties of evil to be found in the world, one would, presumably, have to begin by providing a description of the ultimate good (or the whole complex of individual goods) which God intends to achieve. One would then have to show, by an examination of all the kinds and degrees of evils which there are, and the way in which they are actually distributed throughout the world, that this entire collection of evils is positively required, as an absolutely necessary condition, for the achievement of the good in question. Now this project can get off the ground only if it is assumed from the start that our understanding of the nature of the goods which God wants to produce, and our grasp of the necessary connections which might hold between these goods and the different possible sorts of evils, are sufficient to ensure a reasonable chance of success in the venture. This assumption is frequently made uncritically by writers on the problem of evil, especially by those attempting to use the problem as the basis of an argument for God's non-existence; but it may reasonably be doubted whether the extent of our knowledge is anywhere near as impressive as these thinkers suppose. In fact, the Christian religion itself lays great stress on the near-impotence of the human intellect in fathoming the ways of God. This attitude is powerfully expressed in the Book of Job: Then Job answered the LORD: 'I know that thou canst do all things, and that no purpose of thine can be thwarted. "Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?" Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. q Given that the insistence on the limitations of human knowledge in regard to God's providence is a characteristic tenet of orthodox Christianity, it follows that any attempt to argue from evil to the non-existence of God by an uncritical assumption of the contrary view - that if there are sufficient reasons for God's permission of evil the human mind must be capable of grasping them, and grasping them exhaustively - amounts to apetitioprincipii in favour of the atheistic view. This point is of such importance that it is worth emphasising at some length. For traditional Christian theism, the fact that God's ways are difficult (to say the least) for man to understand is a consequence of the fact that the divine nature itself is beyond man's intellectual grasp; in investigating the problem of evil, or any other issue related to God's providence, we are dealing with a being Who so far transcends the created world as to make all human thought about him subject to severe limitations and inadequacies. In a much-quoted passage, St Thomas Aquinas insists that 'we cannot know 1 Job 42: I-4 (RSV edition).</page><page sequence="8">26 F. J. FITZPATRICK concerning God what he is, but only what he is not',1 and we can find this insistence also in the works of Christian theologians and spiritual writers from Patristic times onwards. Of course, Aquinas does go on to supplement the vza negativa or via remotionis (the process of determining what sorts of things God is not) with a defence of the application to God, by a process of analogy, of certain adjectives whose primary use is to denote various perfections in human beings ('wise', 'good', 'powerful', etc.); but he is careful to add the proviso that such perfections pertain to God in a manner which we are unable adequately to comprehend. The positive ascription of these perfections to God is made on the basis of God's being the creator of the universe: since God is the cause of all the reality and perfection which exists in creatures, Aquinas says, he must possess all this perfection in himself, but in some higher way which is in accordance with his nature, and which we cannot properly grasp. This line of argument exemplifies what is known as the via eminentiae: since all the things we experience 'are effects dependent upon a cause, we must be able to be led from them to knowing that God is, and to what must pertain to him in so far as he is the ultimate cause of all - also the differences of creatures from this cause in so far as he is not any of those things which are caused by him - and we know that these are not denied of him on account of any lack on his part, but because he surpasses them all'.2 Aquinas's distinction between the via remotionis and the via eminentiae is paralleled in the Eastern Church by the distinction between apophatic or negative theology, on the one hand, and kataphatic or affirmative theology on the other. It is, indeed, arguable that Orthodox theologians have stressed the transcendence of God much more powerfully than have Western theologians such as St Thomas: certainly the teaching of St Gregory Palamas, with its distinction between the divine essence and the divine energies, and its insistence that the former is utterly incomprehensible to human beings, not only during this life but even in the beatific vision, seems to take the via remotionis a good deal further than Aquinas and other Western theologians were prepared to take it.3 The analysis and description of human knowledge of God is admitted by theists to be an immensely intricate and difficult task, and here all I am concerned to do is to outline the way in which human understanding of the divine nature is, according to traditional Christian theism, profoundly inadequate. The point is that our notion of God is delineated both in terms of the way in which he differs from his creatures (the via remotionis) and also in terms of his transcendence of the entire created order (the via eminentiae); and neither of these sources of knowledge is capable of yielding a precise ' S. Theol., Ia, iii, prologue; cf. also ia, i, 7, ad ium; Ia, xii, I3, ad ium; In Boethii de Trinitate, i, ii, ad ium. 2 S. Theol., I a, xii, 12. 3 Cf. V. Lossky, The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church (London, I957), chapter 4.</page><page sequence="9">ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ON EVIL 27 characterisation of his intrinsic nature. Now, I certainly do not want to imply that this view of man's knowledge of God is totally perspicuous or free from objection. On the contrary, many difficulties arise when we try to make the appropriate distinctions precise and rigorous. But it is important to realise that this is the view to which traditional theism is committed, and hence that it would be a question-begging procedure to challenge the tenability of Christian belief on the ground of the presence of evil in the world if this challenge presupposed that God's nature and purposes can be comprehended fairly adequately by the human mind; and this presupposition has, it seems, been made by a good number of recent writers on the problem of evil. Suppose, now, that this traditional, and severely restrictive, Christian view of human knowledge of God is correct. What difference does it make to the way in which the problem of evil should be tackled? Well, an essential tenet of Christian belief is that God's primary aim or goal in his dealings with the world is to lead men into an intimate communion or fellowship with himself, involving an intensely personal relationship of knowledge and love. But if the goal towards which God is directing us is none other than himself, and if our understanding of God's nature is severely limited in the way just described, then our conception of the good which God is acting to bring about is bound to suffer from a similarly severe limitation. And if we can have no conception of this good which is at all adequate to its reality, neither can we have any adequate conception of the sorts of conditions (including evils) which might be required for its attainment. For all we know, a great number of evils, of various kinds and in varying degrees of intensity, may be required by absolute necessity if the divine purpose for the world is to be realised; and the fact that such-and-such a kind or degree or, spread of distribution of evil may seem to us, in our present situation, to be utterly gratuitous is no reason for believing that it is utterly gratuitous. Due to our profound ignorance of God's nature and of his purposes vis-a-vis human beings, we are in no position to give anything like a final verdict on the issue of whether or not any particular evil or possible collection of evils is absolutely required for the accomplishment of the divine plan. It follows that although the theist must believe that the evils of this world are absolutely necessary conditions for subsequent good, he is under no obligation to show conclusively that these necessary connections obtain, or to describe their nature; for on his own premises there is a sound reason for denying that such necessary connections should be transparent to the human mind. The theist may, then, be content to admit that he cannot explain how the evils of this world are justified, while adding that his inability to produce a decisive vindication of God's justice is only to be expected, given man's pathetically meagre understanding of the divine nature and purposes. This is as much as the theist will be able to say when he deals with the problem of evil in isolation from other issues in the philosophy of religion; but if he</page><page sequence="10">28 F. J. FITZPATRICK is able in some way (for instance, by relying on one or other of the traditional theistic proofs) to demonstrate that there is a being who is both omnipotent and all-good, then he will be able to conclude, not just that there may be a solution to the problem, but that there actually is one - although the nature of this solution will still be unknown to him. But disregarding the matter of proofs of God's existence and the certainty which they provide (if sound) of a genuine solution to the problem, the foregoing argument shows, I believe, that the problem of evil cannot legitimately function as an argument for atheism. For any argument from evil to God's non-existence must presuppose that necessary connections between evil and subsequent good are discoverable by human reason in its present state; and to presuppose this is already to deny a fundamental point of theistic belief and therefore to beg the question against the theist. In his treatment of the specific abstract problems of evil, Ahern argues for this same conclusion, that the problem of evil, considered in isolation from other issues in philosophical theology, cannot lead to a decisive vindication of either theism or atheism. The argument he employs, however, seems to me to be defective. He reiterates the point that God's permission of evil can be justified only by reference to proportionately greater good for which the evil is absolutely necessary, and continues: 'To establish the negative fact that such good is impossible, it would be necessary to have an exhaustive knowledge of possible good and its logical connection, if any, with actual evil. We lack this knowledge. Accordingly, it seems impossible to show, with logical necessity, that actual evil could not be justified with respect to God. '1 Ahern's argument is that any failure by the theist to discern the requisite necessary connections between evil and justifying good does not show that these connections do not exist, because quite possibly they do exist but are not discoverable by human beings in their present earthly state. This procedure, however, faces the obvious objection that if the same line of argument were to be applied in other areas of philosophical debate, it would be impossible for anyone ever to reach a definite conclusion on any issue at all. Suppose that someone holding a certain belief, p, is confronted with an apparently irrefutable argument against that belief. It is always open to him to reply: 'I concede that I cannot see how my adherence to p can be vindicated in the face of this argument, but for all we know there is a counter-argument, at present hidden from us, which would, if known, result in p's being vindicated. It would, after all, be sheer dogmatism to suppose that because I am incapable of hitting upon such a decisive counter-argument it does not exist. Perhaps it does exist, but is readily available only to some being of superhuman intelligence.' We should unhesitatingly reject this reply, since, in general, philosophical argument must proceed on the assumption 1 Ahern, op. cit. p. 50.</page><page sequence="11">ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ON EVIL 29 that if the human mind can grasp the content or tenor of a given proposition, it is normally capable also of grasping and evaluating the various arguments which might be advanced either for or against that proposition. If Ahern's approach to the problem of evil were applied to other philosophical issues it would inevitably produce agnosticism towards any and every proposition which the human mind is capable of entertaining. The theist must provide positive grounds for-believing that the decisive evidence in relation to God's permission of evil is likely to be more inscrutable to us than is the crucial evidence in other areas of philosophical debate. This Ahern signally fails to do, but my argument based upon the theistic appraisal of human knowledge of God does, I believe, succeed in establishing this point. It follows that whereas anyone utilising the problem of evil as an argument for God's non-existence begs the question in favour of atheism by assuming that necessary connections between evil and consequent good should, in principle, be transparent to us, Ahern begs the question in favour of theism by stating baldly, without any supporting argument, that such necessary connections need not be ascertainable by human beings. The issue involved here is really that of locating the onus of proof in arguments about the problem of evil. If my reasoning has been sound, the atheist is notjustified in assuming that any necessary connection which might hold between evil and justifying good should be discoverable by us; for to assume this is already to presuppose that the theistic understanding of human knowledge of God is either straightforwardly false or else incoherent. The atheist must, then, supplement his argument from the existence of evil with a critique of theistic belief on this crucial point. So the onus is on the atheist to show that there is something profoundly unsatisfactory about the theist's appraisal of the scope and limits of human knowledge of God. If he cannot succeed in this task, then he is simply begging the question in challenging the theist to produce a decisive justification of God's permission of evil: for on the theist's premises there are solid grounds for doubting that any such justification should be available. On the other hand, if the theist wishes to deal with the problem of evil by appealing to human ignorance of necessary connections between good and evil, he must also be prepared to defend the conception of the nature of God, and the appraisal of our knowledge of God, on which this belief is based. Ahern's bald assertion that the necessary connections between good and evil may not be discernible by human beings immediately provokes the question 'Why not?'; and to this some answer must be given. We are, then, forced to the conclusion that the danger of petitio principii is a real one for both theists and atheists in their arguments about the problem of evil. In order to avoid this danger, the philosopher who examines the problem of evil as a distinct problem in itself (i.e. in isolation from other issues in philosophical theology) must, it seems, adopt a position of uncertainty</page><page sequence="12">30 F. J. FITZPATRICK or of suspended judgement towards it; that is, he will be forced to conclude that without some independent argument for God's existence the problem cannot be decisively resolved in a theistic way, and that without some inde pendent argument against the theist's understanding of human knowledge of God the problem cannot be resolved in an atheistic way. This inevitable conclusion concerning the problem of evil is what I shall call 'The Uncertainty Position'. III In the foregoing discussion I have been concerned largely with what Ahern calls the specific abstract problems of evil, that is, the problems involved in determining whether or not the existence of any particular combination of evils of given types, intensities and spreads of distribution can be shown to be either compatible or incompatible with the existence of God. The conclusion for which I have argued is that without some further argument at a more basic level neither of these definite and opposed views can be proven. Before passing on to examine some criticisms which have been directed against this approach to theodicy, I must make some remarks about what Ahern calls the specific concrete problems of evil. Unlike the specific abstract problems, these concrete problems are concerned not with possible kinds, intensities and multiplicities of evil, but rather with the actual evils present in the world. Ahern stresses that the actual evils of this world include not only those which exist now, but past and future evils as well, so that, since there is a distinct concrete problem of evil for every single instance of evil, the solution of all the concrete problems is naturally impossible for us: quite apart from the fact that we have no advance knowledge of what evils the future is going to bring, the task of registering and recording all the evils which have occurred in the past is one which is well beyond the capacity of the human intellect and memory. Of course, if we were able to find a single instance of evil which no amount of subsequent good could justify, then the atheist's case would have been established; but if, as the theist believes, the limitations of human knowledge prevent us from concluding decisively, in respect of any possible combination of evils, that no further good could ever justify it, then the same limitations will necessarily serve to invalidate any attempt to draw this conclusion in the case of actual concrete instances of evil. In arguing that the specific abstract problems of evil admit of no definite resolution in favour of either theist or atheist we have, then, committed ourselves to defending the same conclusion about the concrete problems. As Ahern says, a negative answer cannot be given to any concrete problem of evil, if it is taken as an independent problem. Such an answer would require knowledge of a negative fact, namely that no good which justifies the evil will ever exist. No one can know this since all the good facts about the world cannot be known. It follows that the</page><page sequence="13">ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ON EVIL 31 existence of God can be positively disproved only through the abstract problems of evil and not through the concrete problems taken as distinct problems. If a negative answer is given to any abstract problem, God's non-existence is entailed, should the evil actually exist. Since a negative answer cannot be given to any of the concrete problems, apart from the parallel abstract problem, no answer to these problems as separate problems will ever entail the non-existence of God.' IV The Uncertainty Position has recently come under fire from a number of quarters, and it will be instructive to examine how the argument presented above stands up to the various objections which have been raised. One crucial objection concerns the sufferings of animals. In expounding the Uncertainty Position I have centred my attention on the problem of justifying evils which affect human beings, but it is arguable that once we drop this anthropocentric perspective and consider other varieties of evils, particularly those affecting the animal world, the above argument for the Uncertainty Position is no longer cogent. For this argument was founded on the theist's conviction that the ultimate destiny of man must be explained in terms of his natural orientation to the knowledge and love of God, and no such claim can be made in the case of brute animals. It cannot be claimed, that is, that the animals lower than man have as their goal the beatific vision of God; and hence it cannot be claimed that our inability to characterise God's nature in any adequate way prevents us from specifying the goal or destiny of these animals or the necessary connections which might hold between this destiny and the evils which they encounter. In this area, then, we have no excuse for ignorance. For some contemporary philosophers, indeed, the task of reconciling animal suffering with God's goodness presents a far more intractable problem than that raised by human suffering and moral evil, since in the case of the brute animals we can make no appeal to the purificatory or soul-building value of suffering or of the resistance of temptation to sin. Professor Antony Flew, in his book God and Philosophy, outlines some of the standard theistic responses to the problem of evil, particularly those which emphasize the opportunities for human spiritual and moral growth provided by the presence of the various evils. He then adds: Wait a minute. Even if the if-clauses can be satisfied the apologist is nowhere out of the wood yet. First, there are many evils which it scarcely seems either are or could be redeemed in this way: animal suffering, for instance, especially that occurring before - or after - the human period ... Without rating the good of the lower animals above that of the highest, such pain seems plainly a fault. If we consider, as most of us do, that - say.- failure to put a grievously suffering beast out of its misery constitutes a gross defect from human decency, then it is surely inconsistent to con cede that a Creator neglecting to do the same could be Derfectlv zood.2 i Ahern, op. cit.

Rowe has constructed a deductive argument for atheism which is based upon an appeal to the existence of animal, not human, suffering. He asks us to imagine a bushfire in which a fawn is trapped, horribly burned, and lies in terrible agony for several days before death relieves its suffering. So far as we can see, the fawn's intense suffering is pointless. For there does not appear to be any greater good such that the prevention of the fawn's suffering would require either the loss of that good or the occurrence of an evil equally bad, or worse. Nor does there seem to be any equally bad or worse evil so connected to the fawn's suffering that it would have had to occur had the fawn's suffering been prevented.1 The author admits that it is open to the theist, faced with this objection, to reply: 'I admit that I can conceive of no particular good, or set of goods, which might necessitate such suffering and make it worthwhile, but I believe that God knows of the possibility of some justifying good and that he actually provides it on such occasions.' But Rowe, while conceding that justifying good of this sort cannot be shown to be impossible, claims that it would nevertheless be totally unreasonable for a theist to respond to his challenge in this way. He asks: Is it reasonable to believe that there is some greater good so intimately connected to that suffering that even an omnipotent, omniscient being could not have obtained that good without permitting that suffering, or some evil at least as bad? It certainly does not appear reasonable to believe this. Nor does it seem reasonable to believe that there is some evil at least as bad as the fawn's suffering such that an omnipotent being simply could not have prevented it without permitting the fawn's suffering.2 Rowe's argument is ostensibly a powerful one, because if we try to conceive ofjustifying good for which intense animal suffering might be an absolutely necessary condition we do seem to find ourselves completely at a loss. Does the theist, then, have any satisfactory response to the objection? One attempt at a solution which should, I believe, be firmly rejected is that which Professor Geach defends in Providence and Evil. Geach claims that the way the world is structured and organised makes it abundantly clear that the creator of the world is simply not concerned to avoid the sufferings of the lower animals; there is not a sufficient community of nature between God and the animals to warrant his being sympathetic with them in their misfortunes. Geach says: One virtue, if I am right, that God cannot share with his creatures is the virtue of sympathy with physical suffering. It is virtuous that a man should in measure sympathize with the sufferings of the lower animals... But it is not a virtue that can reasonably be ascribed to the Divine Nature. God is not an animal as men are, and if he does not change his designs to avoid pain and suffering to animals he is not violating any natural sympathies ... Only anthropomorphic imagination allows us to accuse God of cruelty in this regard.3 I W. L. Rowe, 'The Problem of Evil and some Varieties of Atheism', American Philosophical Quarterly, XVI (0979), 337. 2 Ibid. 3 Geach, op. cit. pp. 79-80.</page><page sequence="15">ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ON EVIL 33 This attitude seems to me quite indefensible. If we admit - as we must, I think - that any intense suffering experienced by a brute animal is a physical evil, then we must also admit that God, being perfectly good, would not permit such an evil to take place unless there were a compelling reason for him to do so. And if there is such a compelling reason, it must presumably be in terms of the necessity of this suffering if proportionately greater good (not necessarily, of course, good for the animal concerned) is to be realised. But the problem for the theist, as posed in Rowe's article, is: Does it seem reasonable to believe in a connection of this sort between animal suffering and greater good, or is such suffering quite plainly gratuitous? Apologists for theism have generally recognised the problem as one of immense difficulty, and some Christian thinkers have tried to tackle it by proposing speculative theories about the divine plan for animals. C. S. Lewis, for instance, in The Problem of Pain, suggested that at least some of the lower animals might possess spiritual and immortal souls, and that the evils which accrue to them in this life might, therefore, be preparatory to and necessary for a glorified animal existence in the next;1 and Fr M. C. Darcy proposed that an awareness of the various animal natures and characters is of great importance in the emotional and moral development of human beings.2 It is open to question whether speculative proposals of this kind can be defended against objection and developed in sufficient detail to show that Rowe's appeal to 'reasonableness' is inconclusive; but they certainly deserve closer attention than has so far been given them in philosophical circles. At any rate, I wish here to make two points which should, I think, be insisted upon in any discussion of animal pain. The first is a general observation concerning human knowledge of what the sufferings of animals are like, and the second is a suggestion based on God's power to alleviate those sufferings. First, then, there is the fact that human beings are unavoidably ignorant of the nature of animal suffering in itself, and tend to regard it as phenomenally similar, in most respects, to human suffering. Confronted with the sight of an animal which has been severely wounded, we are prone to 'read into' the animal's consciousness exactly the same pattern of pains, emotions and thoughts which we ourselves should experience if subjected to a similar misfortune. But there is no rational ground for believing that animal and human consciousness are anywhere near as similar as this spontaneous reaction on our part would seem to presuppose. The brute animals lack so much that is part and parcel of the human mind's organisation and systematisation of its sensory and affective data - particularly with regard to awareness of temporal duration and the operation of memory - that we must be sceptical of any attempt to interpret animal consciousness on the model of human consciousness, no matter how seemingly natural a response 1 C. S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain (London, I966), pp. I24-30. 2 M. C. Darcy, The Problem of Evil (London, I 971), pp. I3-14. RES 17</page><page sequence="16">34 F. J. FITZPATRICK this may be. The point here is not, of course, that the sufferings of animals are insignificant and may be disregarded, but rather that since we know very little about the nature of such suffering as the animals themselves experience it, we are hardly in a position to suggest which goods, if any, might be required to justify it. Secondly, let us suppose that a theist who has carefully investigated the problem of animal pain is forced to conclude that no attempted solution of the problem is even remotely satisfactory, and that the assumption that justifying good exists does indeed, as Rowe believes, seem on the face of it to be unreasonable. Is this the end of the line for the theist, or can he still legitimately appeal to some unavoidable element of uncertainty? Well, if the theist can present a sound argument for God's existence he will be justified in claiming that there must be some explanation of animal suffering which totally vindicates God's providence, despite the apparent unavailability of such an explanation. He may perhaps wish to add the suggestion that the prima facie unreasonableness of animal suffering is actually used by God as an instrument for testing men's faith in his providence, and is therefore itself a means to greater good. Quite apart, however, from this tactic, based as it is upon the appeal to some proof of God's existence, the theist who finds himself at a loss to account for animal pain may, as a last resort, produce the following argument: Since God is omnipoent, he can prevent animals from experiencing intense suffering in all those cases in which we should ordinarily expect such suffering to be felt. Whenever intense animal suffering would in fact be gratuitous, then, we may believe that God, being perfectly good, will intervene to prevent it from being experienced. Of course, God may still allow animals to display those bodily reactions which we should normally regard as the characteristic physiological and behavioural manifestations of intense pain; but since there is a clear ontological distinction between pain and its normal overt manifestations, it is quite possible for the latter to take place without the former. There is, of course, no positive evidence that God actually does intervene to produce this result, but equally there is no positive evidence that he does not. Hence the theist can conclude that Rowe's formulation of his 'unreasonableness' argument relies on a presupposition which is open to question; for in describing the fawn as being 'in terrible agony for some days' he is assuming the existence of a situation which may never exist, since it may be prevented by God's power. Here again, the question of the onus of proof is central. Rowe might claim, perhaps, that in order to make this appeal to divine power the theist is obliged first to show some positive grounds for supposing that God actually does intervene in the way suggested; but I cannot see that there is any convincing argument in favour of this claim. On the contrary, the onus of proof surely rests on those who charge that the theist's recourse to this option is</page><page sequence="17">ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ON EVIL 35 indefensible. Admittedly, the theist's argument is clearly based on the acceptance of a definite ontological distinction between pain and its various physical and behavioural manifestations, and he must therefore be prepared to defend his belief in this ontological distinction. This involves refuting such opposed positions as philosophical behaviourism, as well as Wittgenstein's argument from the impossibility of a 'private language'; but since I believe that the standard defences of these positions can be and have been shown to be worthless I do not regard this task as involving any serious difficulty. v Among the criticisms of the Uncertainty Position which have recently appeared in print, only that presented by Rowe, as far as I am aware, has been centred on the problem of accounting for animal suffering. Nevertheless, the issue of locating the onus of proof is no less crucial in the case of those criticisms which are primarily concerned with evils affecting human beings. Most recent objections to the Uncertainty Position have, I believe, tended to proceed along much the same lines, and so I shall take as a fairly representative example Mr Michael Martin's article 'Is Evil Evidence against the Existence of God?'1 Martin sets out the following three propo sitions, of which the first two express the theist's conception of God, and the third is true as a matter of ordinary observation: (i) God is all powerful. (2) God is all good. (3) Evil exists in great abundance. To these three propositions MAartin adds the following, which he believes to be true: (4) The existence of evil in great abundance is not logically necessary, and there is no sufficient reason for God to allow evil in great abundance. And Martin claims that propositions (I )-(4) make up the premises of a deductive argument for the non-existence of God. It is, I think, clear that such an argument would be formally valid, and hence that the theist, since he must accept propositions (i), (2) and (3), can avoid assenting to the conclusion of this atheistic argument only by rejecting proposition (4). An initially puzzling feature of the way proposition (4) is formulated is Martin's addition of the second clause (' .. . there is no sufficient reason for God to allow evil in such abundance'). The puzzlement arises because it is hard to see what sufficient reason God could possibly have for the permission of evil, other than its being absolutely necessary for the attainment of greater good (or, perhaps, the avoidance of yet greater evil). This second clause, then, appears to be superfluous; but Martin's purpose in adding it is presumably to secure the validity of his argument against the possible objection that God 1 Mind, LXXXVII (I978), 429-32. 2-2</page><page sequence="18">36 F. J. FITZPATRICK may have a sufficient reason for permitting evil which has nothing to do with evil's being a necessary condition for the attainment of greater good (or for the avoidance of greater evil). Such an objection would seem to me to be rather implausible, but it is at least a possible reply, and so Martin's argument, in order to be valid, must be proof against it. The only point on which I should wish to amend Martin's formulation of the proposition concerns his apparent conviction that if an evil is necessary for the attainment of some good it must be logically necessary for its attainment: this assumption that all necessity is logical necessity is (as indicated in footnote I above) seriously open to question, and hence proposition (4) needs to be rewritten so as to allow for the possibility of a synthetically necessary connection between evil and consequent good, in some such way as the following: (i') The existence of evil in great abundance is not absolutely necessary, and there is no sufficient reason for God to allow evil in great abundance. where the notion of absolute necessity is understood to cover both logical necessity and necessity of a synthetic a priori kind. (Not, of course, that this amendment to Martin's key premise really makes the theist's job any easier, since the finding of genuinely synthetic a priori necessities is no simpler a task than that of specifying cases of logical necessity.) The crucial question is: Do we have any grounds for accepting proposition (i') as true? That is, do we have any reason to believe that the evils present in our world are not absolutely necessary and that God has no sufficient reason for allowing them? Martin's view, evidently, is that to pose this question is to locate the onus probandi in the wrong place, since one thereby charges the atheist with the responsibility of showing that the requisite necessary connections (and, therefore, the requisite sufficient reasons on God's part) do not obtain. On the contrary, Martin believes, the onus of proof lies with the theist: it is up to him to show that God does have sufficient grounds, based on intrinsically necessary connections, for allowing the evils of this world to occur, and if no such grounds can be provided then the argument must be resolved in the atheist's favour. Martin writes: There is no a priori way to demonstrate the truth of (4); however, all attempts to show that (4) is false have failed. Apologists down through the ages have failed to specify a sufficient reason for God allowing evil ... These failures should give us some confidence in (4). For if every attempt to specify a needed explanation fails over a long period of time this failure gives one good reason to suppose that an explanation is impossible.' It is arguable that the efforts of theistic apologists to reach an understanding of God's permission of evil have not been as consistently fruitless as Martin is claiming; certainly there are some attempted explanations of particular kinds of evils which appear to have a good deal of merit, and in my view 1 Martin, art. cit. p. 430.</page><page sequence="19">ONUS OF PROOF IN ARGUMENTS ON EVIL 37 Martin's blanket dismissal of these apologetical labours is, to say the least, cavalier. On the other hand it must, I think, be conceded that there has never been a successful attempt to explain, in a way consistent with God's power and goodness, the sum total of evils in the world. Does the failure to provide this sort of all-encompassing explanation ofevil mean that no such explanation is possible, and hence that God does not exist? Here the problem of the onus probandi becomes crucial: we should be justified in answering 'Yes' to this question only if there were grounds for believing (or, at least, no grounds for disbelieving) that the explanation is one which is readily available to the human mind. But if the traditional theistic view of the nature of God, and of the extent of human knowledge of the divine nature, is correct (and nothing in Martin's argument casts any doubt upon it), then we do have reasons for supposing that an explanation of this conclusive sort is one which the human intellect is powerless to supply. If it is true that the nature of God is not comprehensible, in any adequate way, by human beings (at least in their present condition on earth); and if, also, the ultimate goal towards which human beings are orientated-and in terms of which, therefore, the evils experienced in this life are to be justified-is one of communion with God; then the goal of human existence cannot be grasped by human beings in any way which is adequate to its reality. Hence there can be no question of inspecting and reflecting on this ultimate goal with a view to compiling a complete list of those evils which might be necessary in order that it should eventually be reached. From the theist's point of view it is not a matter for surprise that ambitious attempts to provide an all-encompassing resolution of the problem of evil should generally have ended in failure; what would occasion great surprise would be the exposition of an all-encompassing account which seemed prima facie to be successful. It is on the issue of the onus of proof, then, that Martin's attempted proof of atheism comes to grief. It is up to the atheist to produce grounds for rejecting the view that the evils of this world are justified by being necessary conditions for the attainment of the ends which God intends to bring about; he'cannot insist on the theist's specifying these necessary conditions on pain of abandoning his theism. VI One of the charges recently levelled against the Uncertainty Position has been that theists who utilize this approach to the problem of evil are 'taking a holiday from theodicy'.1 This is a somewhat tendentious way of describing the situation, clearly presupposing that the task of producing a completely adequate theodicy is one which the theist is positively obliged to carry out: P p. H. Hare and E. H. Madden, 'Evil and Inconclusiveness', Sophia, ix (1972), II.</page><page sequence="20">38 F. J. FITZPATRICK the implication is that belief in god is rationally defensible only if an all-embracing, exhaustive solution to the problem of evil can be found. This, however, is a presupposition which the theist should firmly reject. If the argument of this paper is correct, then not only is this sort of philosophical activity not imposed on theists as a positive obligation, but in fact there are, on the basis of traditional theism itself, solid grounds for doubting that it could ever be successfully carried out. This is not to say that speculation about the goods which God wants to produce, and about the various necessary connections which might hold between these goods and antecedent evils, should not be engaged in. It means, rather, that those who do engage in such speculation should not do so in the belief that the tenability of theism is somehow dependent upon their success, and that they should not be too surprised if their analyses of particular varieties of evil, while appearing to hold good in many cases, should nevertheless break down when applied to other situations. The theist's own conception of the nature of God, and of the severely limited extent of human knowledge of this divine nature, should lead him to conclude that such breakdowns are not to be despaired at, but are actually to be expected.</page></plain_text>
