<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS LIFE IN INDIA AT THE ADVENT OF BRITISH RULE V. P. S. Raghuvanshi INFLUENCE OF RELIGIONS OVER SOCIETY In spite of the intensity of religious life and genuine attachment of the people to their faith, Indian society in the eighteenth century was singularly free from communal bitterness and sectarian fanaticism. This has been specially noted by European residents and travellers in this country. Scrafton writes that in Bengal people were "equally ready to resign their lives to preserve their religious purity" and the accounts of Abbe de Guyon, Craufurd, Dubois, Forbes, Orme and others testify to the religious devotion of the people in other parts of India, their strict- ness in the observance of their religious ceremonies and their great enthusiasm for their religious festivals.1 Forbes says, "I sometimes almost envied these peaceful Hindus the pleasures they enjoyed in the performance of their religious duties and the delights of social worship."2</page><page sequence="2">MODERN INDIA 101 Craufurd informs us that the inauguration of a temple was attended with great ceremony and expense and that at its annual festivals pilgrims resorted from distant places.3 Mrs. Ali dilates on the "zealous, emula- tive spirit" of the followers of the prophet, their profound belief in his prophetic mission and their willingness to endure the fatigue and priva- tions of the pilgrimage to Mecca.4 Among the Parsees, we are informed, that there were few who did not believe that the holy fire which their ancestors brought with them on their memorable flight from Persia had continued burning in like manner in their ancient temple at Daman. They carried their adoration of fire to this extent that they hesitated in putting out a burning lamp or candle. If on some occasion fire broke out in any of their houses they would not extinguish it by water but demolished the adjacent buildings leaving the flames to disappear into the void.5 It is easy to multiply such accounts which suggest that religion was a potent formative influence on the character and outlook of people. SECTARIANISM Sectarianism was a salient feature of religious life in this country. Every religion had branched into numerous sects and among the Hindus the orthodox cults of Siva and Vishnu had further split into numerous sub-sects. The rites and ceremonies of different sects also differed con- siderably and people displayed their sectarian attachment through out- ward marks and signs. But still people were very much eclectic in their outlook and the existence of the various sects did not in any way engender narrow sectarian outlook or isolation. The devout worshippers of Ram had no objection to the adoration of Siva or any other god and the gods of different sects were hardly competing for supremacy amongst them- selves. So far as the masses are concerned, it is true, that they were ignorant of the subtle distinctions of sects and popular religion was very broad and complicated in its range of worship. Among the Hindus sectarian differences did not prevent marriage and social connections and women usually adopted the sect of their husbands.6 Dubois reports that among the Hindus change from one sect to another too was not an un- common thing.7 Of Hindu scholars we are told that they did not carry their scholastic differences to the point of reciprocal hatred or persecu- tion.8 In this respect the tolerance and rationalism of Brahmins, the custodians of the religious interests of Hinduism, was remarkable. With the incubus of the inquisition haunting their vision the Europeans of this age failed to reconcile the deep religious temperament of the Hindus with their sober tolerant outlook and made all sorts of conjectures on the nature of Hinduism as a religion. Grose was, however, able to appre- ciate their attitude towards different religions and their reluctance to advocate change of religion. He writes :</page><page sequence="3">102 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS "As to that spirit of toleration in religion, for which the gentoos (Hindoos) are so singularly distinquished, it is duobtless owing to their fundamental tenet of it; of which the purpose is; 'that the diver- sity of the modes of worship is apparently agreeable to the God of the Universe; that all prayers put to him from men, are all equally acceptable and sanctified to him, by the sincerity of the intention: that the true universal religion is no other than the religion of the heart. . . "9 RELATIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT RELIGIONS The spirit of toleration which characterised the conduct of the Hindus amongst themselves was equally shared by them with other reli- gious groups. Inter-communal relations were consequently free from violent symptoms of bigotry or rabid communalism on religious basis. European accounts give the impression that intercourse between different communities was quite healthy and based on mutual trust and under- standing. It appears that by the eighteenth century the antagonism of sects and creeds in this country had given place to mutual appreciation and tolerance to a remarkable extent, which appears almost incredible when we consider it in the light of communal disturbances in our own period. About life in the south-west Peninsula, Stavorinus, the Dutch traveller (1765-67) writes very definitely: "These three distinct nations, the Moors (Muslims), the Gentoos (Hindus), and the Parsees, whose religions are widely different from each other, exercise the greatest toleration and indulgence in this respect, towards one another; no one is molested on account of his religion; they may be seen together in, and near, the river. Offering up their prayers, each to that being whom he adores, without any marks of derision or contempt being shown by any one : this even goes so far, that the days which one persuasion looks upon as holy, are also looked upon with a degree of veneration by the others. While the holy fire of the Parsees is exhibited to the people, no Gentoo will even approach or touch fire, no more than the Parsees themselves."10 Even in Malabar, the stronghold of Hindu orthodoxy, the small Jewish community freely followed its tenets without reproach or opposi- tion from those of different faiths.11 Of Muslims on that side, Grose noted that they "seem to release of that vigour and fondness for making proselytes" and that at Surat under the Mughal Nawab all religions were tolerated.12 Life was not at all disturbed by communal passions in terri- tories under the Maratha government also. About 1799, William Henry Tone, serving in a Regiment of Infantry under the Peshwas, wrote, about Poona as under:</page><page sequence="4">MODERN INDIA 103 "In Poona, which is the metropolis of the Empire, and the seat of Brahmanical authority, there are many mosques, and one Chris- tian Church, where the votaries of both religions may offer up their devotions without any hindrance or molestation. What a noble example of moderation is this, especially when contrasted with the bigoted and sanguinary principles of Christian and Mohammedan zealots."13 About Northern India Mrs. Ali states that the outside observer could scarcely read marked differences in the life of the common people of the two persuasions (Hinduism and Islam). There was remarkable similarity in their habits, in celebrations of their festivals, and tolerance of each others' customs,. In the rural areas the women of the two faiths met each other on terms of intimacy.14 Twining of the Bengal Service visit- ing Northern India in the last decade of the 18th century does not refer to communal bitterness in any shape. At holy places like Bañaras too the relations between "the haughty Musalman and the humble Hindoo were peaceful."15 About people of Central India Malcolm writes: "There are many institutions, festivals, religions and superstitious beliefs, and usages, in Central India, which may be described as belonging equally to all its Hindu population, and indeed to the greatest proportion of the Mohammedan."16 In the period under review, the relations between Hinduism and Islam show remarkable feeling of intimacy and accommodation, as Forbes says "that now the professions of both religions have acquired a habit of looking each other with an eye of indulgence unusual in other countries between those who maintain such opposite tenets."17 What possibly could disturb the relations was the missionary zeal of the priestly classes. In this connection it may be emphasised that the spirit of Hinduism was against it. In fact it was a "closed church". It did not permit prosely- tism and it was a popular belief that the individual must be born a Hindu, he could not become one.18 The followers of Zoroaster, too, like them did not admit of proselytism. Their worship in their temples was not open to all, and they were very careful in avoiding racial intermixture with other groups.19 About Islam and Sikkhism it is reported that they were expanding religions and their priests were engaged in some mis- sionary activity. But there is no evidence to suggest that it was in any way offensive or prejudicial to the interests of society.20 It would not be rash to conclude that in India in the 18th century religion was more or less a matter of personal faith and not a source of strife in society. It was only in Bengal that at the close of the century the serenity of the religious life of the people had come to the ruffled by Christian missionary propaganda. The abusive remarks of missionaries like Dr. Claudius Buchanan, Vice-Provost of Fort William College, Henry Martyn and Brown etc. created certain alarm among the educated classes of society, and the Company's sepoy battalions.21 Their sectarian propaganda, how-</page><page sequence="5">104 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS ever, could not disturb the communal relations between Hinduism and Islam. HINDU-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS SYNTHESIS By the eighteenth century both Hinduism and Islam had çvolved a healthy pattern of synthesis which makes an instructive study. The cultural synthesis at religious level was most pronounced in Northern India where Islam claimed a large following. In Indian society people reputed holy and saintly exercised a hypnotic spell over popular mind and in the 18th century saint-worship was a great unifying factor in the religious life of the masses. The innumerable altars raised to the memory of the saints, the voluntary contributions made for the main- tenance of their monuments, the ease with which they became centres of popular religious congregations testify to the popularity of saint-worship. Contemporary accounts, Indian and European, are full of references to the notable shrines of saints in different parts of the country and the fact that high and low, all alike offered their oblations there in the hope of fulfilling their wishes. The poems associated with their names were very popular recitations. Some of these had considerable endowments and their custodians daily distributed food to hundreds of poor mendicants.22 In connection with saint-worship, Capt. Francklin reports the existence of a sect of "Muslim Hindus", about 1500 in number, principally in Bundelkhand. Raja Chhatrasal is mentioned to have offered protection to its founder, Ji Eahib, who declared himself as "the promised Imam Medhi". The sect had its chief establishment at Poona, admitted people of all religions, had a temple of "very respectable edifice" and the object of worship was the shrine of the saint. Here is a description of it: "On the top of the tomb was placed the figure of a human head. The brow of frontal aspects of these was marked like the Virashaiva Hindus, with three streaks uniting between the eyebrows, and on the crown was placed something like three fingers, probably in imitation of the streaks on the forehead."23 The report of the sect appears to be inaccurate but it is not difficult to see that saint-worship was very popular and communal differences had no place in it. In Bihar and U. P. the Kabir panthis are mentioned as constituting an important sect and like sects were still springing up.24 Just as the Hindus bowed low at the shrines of Muslim saints, the Muslim masses made offerings before the idols of the Hindu gods. Though Islam upholds monotheism yet in India it was very much influenced by the polytheistic elements of Hindu religion. The various elements of Nature like the Sun and Moon were considered objects of worship by the Muslim also.25 From a sanad of His Highness Malhar Rao in 1740 to one Murad Fakir, we learn how Muslim Fakirs even supervised the wor- ship of village godlings. Before the Maratha rule this Fakir worshipped</page><page sequence="6">MODERN INDIA 105 Shri Maranti Khedapati, the village god. Later he was granted a house and maintenance allowance and a Hindu mendicant was appointed to take charge of the worship of the deity.26 In the north-eastern parts of the country in sickness and danger even Muslims of foreign extraction made offerings to the objects of Hindu devotion. In Bengal, the wor- ship of 'Kali' was very popular with Muslims and even in villages wholly inhabited by them there were distinct places of worship for this deity. Belief in the Hindu objects of worship was shared even by Muslim religious classes, the Kazis, Mullahs, Fakirs etc. If they themselves did not make offerings they had these presented on their behalf by others.27 In Bengal the religious outlook and practices of the Hindus and Muslims were very much influenced by one another. We learn that Mir Jafar on his death-bed was persuaded by Nand Kumar to sip some drops of water "that had been poured in libation over the idol of Kiriteshwari" (a famous temple in Murshidabad).28 It was customary for Muslims to offer 'Puja' in Hindu temples and the Hindus ťsinni' at mosques. The Brahmans are mentioned as consulting the 'Kuran' and Muslims seeking the benedic- tions of the 'Sapta-Rishis', the illustrious seven sages of the Hindu mytho- logy.29 In contemporary Bengali writings of Muslim poets we find Mus- lims represented as praying to the god 'Siva' and we come across the following hymn addressed to 'Saraswati' the goddess of learning: "Hail O Saraswati, thou art mother Thy helpless child invokes thee: Will thou not hear."30 This mutual adoption and assimilation of the religious practices led to the evolution of common worship c-f 'Satya-Pir' which was very popular in Bengal. This has been amply referred to in contemporary Bengali literature. The evolution of the worship of this common deity was the culmination of spiritual intimacy between Hinduism and Islam: in this land of universal toleration. * The elements of anthropomorphism, which Islam imbibed in the Indian environment also bear eloquent testimony to the influence of popular Hinduism over the orthodoxy of the sister faith. The various innovations Badshah Begum introduced in the religious life of the royal palace at Lucknow reveal the tremendous modification in Islam in this country. Tombs were erected in memory of the eleven Imams and prayers were offered beside them. Handsome Syed girls were brought to the palace and named as the wives of the Imams. They were called 'Achooti' and after the custom of the Devadasis, the Begum did not permit them to marry and asked them to dedicate their lives to the service of religion. The Begum every morning on getting up from the bed would first have a sight of their face as a happy omen.31 Mrs. Ali writes that the Tazia graced the houses of all good Muslims in India who were not of the 'Suni' sect, and this model of Imam's tomb was an object of profound respect.32 The author of Oanooni-i-Islam also mentions that the popular religion of the Shias in South India betrayed leanings towards Imam-worship and 14</page><page sequence="7">106 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS saint-worship/'3 Such religious practices of the Muslims were a part of the psychological transformation which Islam underwent under the dominating influence of Hinduism. The regard shown by Hindus to Muslim customs and the adoption by Muslims of Hindu customs was most manifest in the celebration of important religious festivals. Remarking on it Broughton says: "It is notorious, indeed, that the Mohammedans of India have deviated so wide- ly from the institutions of their forefathers, and have adopted so many of the customs and prejudices of the Hindoos, that they form almost a distinct class from their brethren in other parts of the world".34 In the territories governed by Mahadji Scindhia, during the Muharram festival, he further informs us that the Hindus joined with the Muslims, posed as Fakirs wearing green rags and went about begging, and that Mahadji himself "is a Fakir during the whole of the Muharram". The Hindus spent large sums on the construction of the Taziyas and that throughout Muharram they spread their entertainments and shared the morning of their Muslim brethren. The same was true of other parts of the country.35 So far as the 'Holi' is concerned it was almost a national festi- val celebrated by all classes of people throughout India. Its days were the "season of universal merriment and joy."36 The spring festival of 'Basant' was another and at Lucknow the Muslim court celebrated it, all clad in yellow and the Muslim king gave a public banquet and organised public amusements on grand scale.37 In the realm of superstitions a divid- ing line can hardly, be drawn among the people of different faiths. They held similar notions about witchcraft and magic, dreaded evil spirits and ghosts and wore similar amulets and talismans. Both consulted the astrologers, the prophets of destiny, alike. A study of popular religion and superstitions produces the impression that the masses, Hindu and Muslim, certainly constituted a like fraternity defying all exclusiveness. ^crafton: Reflections on the Government of Indostan, London, 1763, p. 11. 2 Forbes: Oriental Memoirs, Second Edition, London, 1834.
