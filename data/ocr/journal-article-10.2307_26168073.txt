<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Kinds of Life: On the Phenomenological Basis of  the Distinction between   “Higher” and “Lower” Animals Christiane Bailey Department of Philosophy, Université de Montréal, 6536 St-Laurent, Montréal,  Québec, Canada  H2S 3C6; christiane.bailey@umontreal.ca Drawing upon Husserl and Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological constitution of the  Other through Einfühlung, I argue that the hierarchical distinction between higher  and lower animals—which has been dismissed by Heidegger for being anthropocentric— must not be conceived as an objective distinction between “primitive” animals and  “more evolved” ones, but rather corresponds to a phenomenological distinction between  familiar and unfamiliar animals. For man, there can only be man. Animals, for Husserl, are  variants of humanity. —Merleau-Ponty, La nature Introductory Remarks Our conception and treatment of animals is deeply influenced by a  common distinction between “lower” and “higher” animals.1 Since this  hierarchical distinction is obviously anthropocentric—that is, made in  relation to the kind of life that is ours—many contemporary discourses  in philosophy, ethics, and critical animal studies argue we should  abandon distinctions between kinds of animal altogether. This popular  reflex in our “antispecist” times is echoed in Heidegger’s analysis of  animal life, in which he refuses to interpret animal behaviors through  Einfühlung to avoid both anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism.  However, I will argue this strategy closes from the start all possibility  1.

Drawing from  a phenomenological analysis of the constitution of others through  empathy in Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, I suggest the distinction between  higher and lower animals corresponds less to an “objective” divide  between primitive and evolved animals than to a phenomenological  distinction between familiar and unfamiliar animals. This distinction is  between forms of life in which we spontaneously perceive meaningful  expressions and animals whose lives are so estranged from our own that  we cannot immediately understand them. Speaking of “familiar” and  “unfamiliar” animals rather than “lower” and “higher ones may help  us acknowledge the fact that our understanding of others is grounded  on our being-with them and therefore is not a rigid, all-or-nothing  phenomenon. Belonging to the very nature of intersubjectivity is the  fact that strange forms of life may become familiar ones, precisely  through our gradual acquaintance with them. This “anthropomorphic”  feature in our understanding of other animals that makes us distinguish  sharply between kinds of living being is less a prejudice we should try  to eliminate of than a structure of our consciousness of which we should  be aware. Pre-Scientific Reflections on Animals  We all come into a world already inhabited, not only by fellow human  beings or perplexing strangers, but also by a multiplicity of animals.  Although I was born in a house full of cats and dogs, I learned about  other animals, the wild ones, or those raised in farms, like other children— through books and television. Probably like them, I was not aware that  earthworms and flies were animals until this was taught to me. Even  now, when I speak of animals, I very rarely think of those lizards, snails,  and bees that were Heidegger’s favorite examples of animal life. Is there  any truth, any validity in this pre-scientific distinction between kinds  of animals? Why do I make such a sharp distinction between chimps  and bees, between dogs and snakes? Is this difference in kind between  those animals merely a reflection of my own tastes and values? Do these  distinctions tell more about myself than about the animals themselves?  If such was the case, I should be able, from a rational standpoint, to get  rid of this prejudice and realize that their lives merely differ in degree  from one another. But even now that I know insects too are animals, I do  not usually think of beetles and cockroaches as animals. Furthermore it  would seem strange or awkward to say that a dog is an animal in the same  way an ant is. In our ordinary understanding, they occupy completely  different planes of being, even though “a scientific stance” will always  remind us that they are all animals, that we are all animals. The absolute validity of this truth would greatly simplify matters.  I could then know “what it is like” to be an animal because, in fact,  </page> <page sequence="3"> Kinds of Life 49 I am one. To this, Husserl would reply that the only knowledge of  what being anything is like necessarily comes from myself. Thus, I can  probably say I know what being a twenty-first century, French-speaking  Canadian woman is like. But can I say I know what being a human  being is like? To an enquiring cockroach or a philosophy-fond bat,  perhaps I could. But there are already enough ways to be human to  make this problematic. Do I know what being an Inuit is like? Can I  have the faintest idea of what it is like to be blind? Or insane? These are  all ways of being human, and yet I cannot even begin to understand  these lives from the inside. Nevertheless, there must be something it is  like to lead these lives. How do I know that? Is it because they speak?  Speech deprivation has always been a key element feeding the belief  that animals lack any interiority. But if Heidegger is right to argue  that assertion or propositional speech (logos apophantikos) is a derivative  mode of language, should not this principle be applied to men as well  as animals? The fact that “the explicitness of assertion can be absent  does not justify our denying that there is any” because “articulation lies  before our making any thematic assertion about it” (Heidegger 1986, 149  [1962, 190]).2 In Being and Time, Heidegger argues that understanding  is already expressed and articulated in behaviors and gestures. For  instance, to sew a button back unto a coat is an articulation of my  understanding of the thing as needing repair. Many animal behaviors  are meaningful and intelligible in the same way human behaviors are.  Do we not understand something about animals by simply looking at what  they do? A dog chasing a cat is not an unintelligible situation, an event  like any other in the push-and-pull domain of physics, but something  we immediately perceive as meaningful: by chasing the cat, the dog  articulates a wordless understanding of the fleeing animal as something  to-chase. When I see animals doing something, I understand something  of their own grasp of the situation, a fragment of their world. Of course,  I can be wrong; I can fail to understand what they do, but the same  remains true with human beings. I am no doubt better at understanding  other human beings than other animals, but the decisive fact is that  animals, or at least some animals, are perceived as other ways of being-in- a-world. They do not merely belong to the nature to be explained but  belong to the space of understanding. On the Borders of Explanation and Understanding (Dilthey) When distinguishing between things we explain and things we  2.

Do we  explain animals or do we understand them? In traditional hermeneutics,  the life we understand—the life that is intelligible—is psychic life and its  various cultural manifestations.4 Of animals, therefore, there would be  only causal explanations. But is it so obvious that “psychic life” means  only human life? Is there not a form of understanding of animals,  precisely in Dilthey’s sense? He defined Verstehen as “a process through  which we perceive something internal” on the basis of expressions of  life (1924, 318). Do we not perceive expressions of lived experiences  (Erlebnisse) in animals as well? The answer will differ according to the animal in question. If I think  of protozoa, of very primitive animals, I will probably agree that there is  no genuine understanding of their behavior: their way of being seems so  remote from our own that they do not immediately make sense to us.  I do not even know what should count as expression in a snake or a  bee; much less could I identify the meaning of those expressions. Is the  snake threatening me? I don’t know. For all I know, he could as well be  trying to seduce me. On the other hand, if I think of higher animals,  like dogs and chimps, one cannot simply ignore the fact that we do often  understand them. After all, as Merleau-Ponty says, “there are ways in  which animals behave that are intelligible [compréhensibles]” (1994, 220).  Although this may not be well-known, Dilthey himself acknowledged,  earlier in his career, that we do understand animals or, at least, some  animals. In Ideas about a Descriptive and Analytical Psychology, he enquires  about “the knowledge of the mental life of animals” and claims that  “our understanding [Verständnis] of vertebrate animals, which possess  the same fundamental organic structure, is, naturally, relatively the best  that we have of animal life” (1924, 199 [1977, 90]). Dilthey therefore  used to think that animals were endowed with some form of psychic  life, and the question was only the extent of our effective access to it. Of  insects like bees and ants, he claimed that their radically different forms  of life made all understanding virtually impossible: Their organization which differs extremely from ours makes it  extraordinarily difficult for us to interpret their bodily expressions;  undoubtedly these expressions correspond with an inner life that  3. Dilthey 1924, 144 (1977, 90): “Die Natur erklären wir, das Seelenleben  verstehen wir.” 4. “Life” (Leben) or “psychic life” (Seelenleben), for Dilthey, means human life:  “In the human sciences, I confine the term ‘life’ [Leben] to the human world.”  (Dilthey 1927, 228-9) </page> <page sequence="5"> Kinds of Life 51 is very strange to us. Here all possibilities to enter a large psychic  domain therefore fail us; this is a totally strange world for us. (ibid.) According to Dilthey, the dissimilarity between the lives of lower animals  and our own makes any understanding difficult or impossible. And  because we share a “fundamental common structure” with higher animals,  we can understand something about their inner life. However, if it is the  relative proximity with our own kind of life that is the decisive criterion  to determine which animals will be called “higher” and which “lower,”  what assures us that we are really talking about animals themselves, and  not merely about ourselves, about our own ability to relate to different  kinds of life? In parsing between animals that are intelligible and those  that are not, am I saying something about the extent and the limits  of their understanding or only talking about the finitude of my own  understanding? If to acknowledge an understanding of animals means  at the same time to acknowledge an understanding to animals, then in  saying that some animals are more difficult to understand than others, I  must therefore imply that there is less to understand in some animals than in others.  This seems to ground all properly hermeneutic understanding: what can  be understood is understandable. I cannot understand thunderstorms, but  only explain them. I do not understand plants, and I do not think that  I should try, because there does not seem to be anything to understand  there. They do not seem to live in a space of meaning, in a world in  Uexküll’s sense.5  Anthropocentrism and the Problem of Hierarchical Distinctions  between Living Beings This brings up the hard problem of projection. Can I understand animals  more akin to me merely because I can effortlessly project my own  categories, feelings, beliefs, and intentions onto these animals? Is  all understanding of animal life anthropomorphic? As we know, it is  precisely in order to “prevent ourselves from ‘empathetically’ projecting  our own feelings onto animals” (1995, 197) that Heidegger will exclude  higher animals from his analysis of animality: In order now to bring the peculiar character of behavior into view,  we must take our methodological point of departure from a consideration of  those forms of behaviors which are more remote, with respect to their  consistent and intrinsic character, than those forms of comportment  displayed by the higher animals that seem to correspond so closely  to our own comportment. We shall therefore consider the behavior of  5. “The plant’s house does without the nervous system; it lacks the perception  and effect organs. As a consequence, there are no carriers of meaning for the  plant, no functional circle, and no effect marks” (Uexküll 2010, 146). </page> <page sequence="6"> 52 Christiane Bailey bees. (Heidegger 1995, 241; emphasis added) Explicitly because of the close similarity between the behavior of higher  animals and our own, Heidegger will focus his study of the essence of  animality on animals that are most foreign to us in order to show that  there is an abyss (Abgrund) between human existence and animal life.6  Before criticizing Heidegger, we must see that there are good reasons  to start with animal species most different from our own. First of all,  Heidegger’s analysis aims at uncovering the essence of animality, and any  statement of essence must hold true for “all animals, every animal.”7  Second, Heidegger wants to avoid an anthropomorphic account of  animal life; he wants to uncover life as a way of being distinct from human  existence. To focus on animals radically foreign to us is the safest way  to avoid “misleading and premature psychological interpretation” of  animals (1995, 197). Thirdly, Heidegger not only wants to avoid the  pitfall of anthropomorphism, but also that of anthropocentrism, which  leads us to divide animal life between “higher” and “lower” animals,  a distinction dependent on an animal’s relative proximity to human  beings.  The problem with Heidegger’s account is not his methodological  bracketing out of higher animals, but rather the fact that these animals,  whose behaviors “correspond so closely to our own comportment,”  will never come back in to the equation. Hence, Heidegger’s radical  conclusion of an abyss between animals and humans. Taking insects  as lode-stars of the analysis concerning the essence of animality will  inevitably orient the inquiry toward instinctual behaviors, leaving aside  phenomena such as animal learning and intelligence, because instinctual  6. Even if, at first, the main thesis according to which “the animal is poor in  world” may seem to point to a difference of degree, Heidegger explains clearly  that the animal’s world-poverty is not a “hierarchical evaluation” and “allows no  evaluative ranking or assessment with respect to perfection and imperfection”  (1995, 194). Being poor does not mean having less, but “being poor means  being deprived [Entbehren]” (1995, 195). The animal’s world poverty (Weltarmüt)  must be understood as a deprivation of world (Weltentbehren)—although this  deprivation is not of the same nature as the not-having-a-world of rocks and  other inanimate objects. 7. Heidegger is careful to note that “it is not a statement of essence because it  holds true for all animals; it holds true for all animals because it is a statement  of essence” (1995, 186). We could go as far as to say that the thesis must hold  for all living beings, including plants (but excluding men, of course) because  Heidegger repeatedly says that he is enquiring about “the essence of life in general”  (1995, 207) and that life is “the kind of being that pertains to animals and plants”  (1995, 179, 188, and 191). On the reduction of animals to the ontological status  of plants in Heidegger’s 1929-30 lecture course, see my paper “La vie végétative  des animaux” (2007). </page> <page sequence="7"> Kinds of Life 53 behaviors are precisely highly stereotyped behaviors. Could Heidegger’s analysis  have been any different if he had adopted a dog or any so-called higher  animals as the spokesman of animal life? He would then have had to  inquire about individual development, and therefore about memory,  experience, and temporality. This could have led him to speak of animals  not only through biological features, but also through biographical  or individual ones. Heidegger admits that his analysis of animal life  is “incomplete” because he “deliberately avoided” the question of  the temporality, of the individual development [Bewegtheit] of animals  because “birth, maturing, aging, and death all too obviously remind us  of the being of man, which we recognize as being historical” (1995, 265– 6). As Gadamer once said, “the being proper to animals is not that of a  particular Da-sein, but that of the species. It is the species that is ‘there’  for an animal” (2002, 80). This is easily said when we have deliberately  left aside the question of the animal’s Bewegtheit:8 once the question of  the individual development of animals has been cautiously excluded,  animals cannot but appear as being the rigorous representatives of their  species, as having no individual history. The Necessity to Distinguish between Kinds of Life Comprehensiveness is obviously not expected in a philosophical  inquiry aspiring to uncover “the essence of animality,” “the essence  of life in general,” but Heidegger’s essentialist approach implies that  we can say something ontologically relevant about living beings in  general, something true of both animals and plants, but not of human  beings. Aristotle already underlined insuperable difficulties in such an  undertaking. Aiming to define the essence of life in his De Anima, he  soon realized that “life” is understood in multiple senses, and that we  cannot give any satisfactory definition of the essence of life in general.  Of course, we can define life by the nutritive soul that is common  to all living beings. Although valid, such a definition relying on the  lowest common denominator is unsatisfactory because plant life (i.e.,  nourishment, growth, reproduction, and decline) does not properly  define the essence of the soul.9 What Aristotle teaches us is that any  adequate account of life must necessarily distinguish between kinds of  life. Heidegger’s refusal to distinguish between types of living beings  8. The notion of Bewegtheit is an important concept in Heidegger’s earlier  work where life mobility (Lebensbewegtheit) reveals itself as a concerned mobility  (Besorgensbewegtheit). See Heidegger 2002a, 115–117. 9. “The living seems to differ from the inanimate mainly by two things, by  movement and perception” (Aristotle, De Anima, I, 2, 403b25–27). </page> <page sequence="8"> 54 Christiane Bailey in his quest toward the essence of life is, as we have said, justified by  his conviction that such hierarchical distinctions would be inadmissibly  anthropocentric. Merleau-Ponty expresses a similar concern: “we  cannot conceive in a hierarchical way the relationships between different  species or between animal species and man” (1994, 375). In their  common refusal of hierarchical distinctions between animals, Merleau- Ponty and Heidegger both explicitly follow Uexküll, who argued that  speaking of lower and higher animals implies, from an evolutionary  standpoint, that some animals would be more “evolved” than others.  For Uexküll, any animal species was as “perfect,” as splendidly adapted  to its environment, as any other (Merleau-Ponty 1994, 224; Heidegger  1995, 194). However, the implications of this shared thesis will be very  different in Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. For the former, a refusal  of hierarchical distinctions leads to the idea that all animals merely  differ in degree from one another, whereas Merleau-Ponty argues that  “there are qualitative differences” (1994, 375). In this respect, Merleau- Ponty is closer to Uexküll than Heidegger. Uexküll’s stroll through the  environing world of the most “primitive” or puzzling animals revealed  fundamental differences between types of living beings.10 Some animals  seemed to him so decentralized that he described them as being mere  “reflex republics”: Sea urchins have a great number of reflex persons, which perform  their reflex task without central direction, each on its own. In order  to make the contrast of animals of this structure to the higher animals  more clear, I have coined the sentence, ‘When a dog runs, the animal  moves its legs. When a sea urchin runs, its legs move the animals.’  (Uexküll 2010, 76; Merleau-Ponty 1994, 222) This famous quote reveals that Uexküll saw essential distinctions  between kinds of animals. Any animal, however “primitive,” lives in its  own Umwelt or “significant surrounding,” but only those endowed with a  central organization create an Innenwelt, an inside world. Merleau-Ponty  recalls this fundamental distinction between kinds of animals, insisting  that, even though lower animals are already organized forms of life,  they do not have “within their organism a counterpart [une réplique] to  the exterior world” (1994, 224). Lower animals have a “cohesion with  their world” with which they form “a closed unity,” but with higher  10. Even though Uexküll is often associated with the idea that “living is  sense-making,” he did not speak of signification (Bedeutung) in reference to  all living beings because “there are no carriers of meaning for the plant”; it is  “immediately immersed” in its environment and these relations “are completely  different than those of animals to their environment” (Uexküll 2010, 146). On  plants and sense-making, see Thompson 2007, 153–57. </page> <page sequence="9"> Kinds of Life 55 animals, an entirely new phenomenon occurs; the construction of a  counter-world (Gegenwelt), a mirror-world (Spiegelwelt):  At the level of higher animals, the Umwelt is no longer a closing-off, but  rather an opening. The world is possessed by the animal. The exterior  world is ‘filtered’ by the animal which, because of a discrimination  of sensory data, can respond to them by fine actions, and these  differentiated reactions are possible only because the nervous system is  geared like a replica of the exterior world (Gegenwelt), as a “duplicate,”  a “copy.” (1994, 225) Merleau-Ponty is here describing the creation of an inside and an  outside—the “apparition” of an invisible—within animal life itself,  a move which also suggests some animals would be deprived of an  “invisible inside.” When and where does an Umwelt give rise to an  Innenwelt and a Gegenwelt? The question is complex. For Uexküll, this  gain coincided with the possession of a central nervous system, but  modern biological research shows things may not be so simple.11 One  cannot even rest assured that, given all relevant empirical data, we  could determine exactly when life implies inner life. “Ultimately,” as  the early “psychologist” Dilthey said, “we do not have the means to  state where psychic life ends and organized matter without it starts.”12 Apperception of the Other or Seeing the Invisible: The Question of  Einfühlung Even if we cannot determine exactly where psychic life stops, we do  know that some animals have an “invisible inside.” How do we come  to know this? Merleau-Ponty’s answer will be Husserl’s: through  Einfühlung. Uexküll claimed that empathy is useless in biological studies  because objective study of animals as subjects is, in fact, possible. By  looking at the anatomical structure of an animal and at its responses  11. We used to think of invertebrates (which represent 95 to 98 percent of all  animals) as being “lower animals” because they lack backbone and a central  nervous system. But we now know some of them have a highly complex  nervous system even though it is not centralized. Octopuses are the most widely  known example. Although the intelligence of cephalopods remains mysterious  because it works along fundamentally different lines than our own (much of the  “processing” is done in ganglia distributed in their body and not centralized in  a brain), ethical comities in Canada and the EU regulate their use in research  and testing because of their alleged cognitive abilities. To this end, octopuses  and other cephalopods are sometimes regarded as honorary vertebrates in order to  be protected against acts of cruelty (Edelman et al. 2005; Mather 2008; Nosengo  2011). 12. Dilthey 1924, 199: “Endlich haben wir auch keine Hilfsmittel festzustellen  wo seelisches Leben endige und organisierte Materie ohne ein solches bestehe.” </page> <page sequence="10"> 56 Christiane Bailey toward various features of its environment, we acquaint ourselves with  the “world” in which the animal lives. No empathy is involved—no  transposition of myself into another—because meaning-carriers (what  counts as a prey, a mate, etc.) are given in the observation of its sense  organs and its behavior. Despite Uexküll’s claims to have always kept  empathy at arms-length, Merleau-Ponty would say that, without any  warm feelings involved, Uexküll could not help but practice Einfühlung  toward animals. Without empathy, no subject could be discerned  anywhere, and Uexküll would never have discovered that “between  the situation of the animal and his movements, there is a meaningful  relationship” (Merleau-Ponty 1994, 230). Any radical distinction  between behaviors and mere physiological processes already implies  empathy. For Merleau-Ponty, “whether we know it or not, we practice  Einfühlung toward animals”: “any zoology supposes from our part a  methodological Einfühlung of animal behavior, with the participation of  the animal in our perceptual life and the participation of our perceptual  life in animality” (1994, 375). Merleau-Ponty’s methodological empathy should not mislead us here.  No reasoning, no inference is implied, but rather a perception—or,  better, an apperception. Never given in direct perception, the other’s  interiority is nonetheless given somehow. Husserl’s notion of “analogical  apprehension” is a way to capture the fact that our apperception of  another subject’s lived experiences is in some way mediated, without  being the product of “an inference” or “a thinking act” (Husserl 1991,  111). The apprehension of another lived body is, for Husserl, “a kind  of assimilating apperception” not to be confused with “reasoning by  analogy [Analogieschluss].” There is, properly speaking, no direct access  to the lived experiences of animals or other men, no direct access to  what Merleau-Ponty calls “the invisible.” This, however, does not  mean the invisible is a construction of mine, the result of some form of  inference, of analogical reasoning. I do not suppose there is an “invisible”  inside animal bodies; I perceive it. Even if Husserl often describes  Einfühlung as a spiritual relation between subjects, a communication  from mind to mind, it is probably better to speak with Merleau-Ponty  of a communication from body to body. Empathy should not be conceived  as an event arising from an act of imagination, but rather as an event  arising from a passive experience of the other’s lived body.13 Such an event is  grounded in a coupling (Paarung) of lived bodies, an association process  13. Natalie Depraz, a French philosopher who has translated many of Husserl’s  texts on animals, distinguishes kinds of empathy: (1) A passive association of  my lived body with yours; (2) An imaginative self-transposal in your psychic  states; (3) An interpretative understanding of yourself as being alien to me; (4)  An ethical responsibility toward yourself as a person (2001, 171). </page> <page sequence="11"> Kinds of Life 57 that occurs “before” any consciousness of an I and a You. Subjectivity is  from the very beginning intersubjectivity, or, as Merleau-Ponty would put  it, intercorporeity (1994, 341). Bracketing the Human-Animal Difference: Animals as Alien Alter  Egos  For Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, the notion of a lived-world (Lebenswelt)  that is always a shared-world (Mitwelt) applies not only to men, but also  to animals. Meditating about intersubjectivity, Husserl asked how a  solipsistic Ego could encounter someone else, anybody else, “in a way  in which the other has not yet attained the sense ‘man’” (1991, 109).  Bracketing every certitude, phenomenological reduction provides  a perspective in which the human-animal distinction rests open and  undecided. The world, says Husserl, is not only given as physical  nature, but also as psychophysical world: “In it we find animals and  human-beings given objectively, we find consciousness objectively tied  to their objectively experienced natural lived-bodies” (1966, 268). At  such a stage, what lays in front of me is merely a corporeal, animated  body, a body deprived of Ego. Only when this body moves itself do I come to  perceive it as “an analogon of my Ego” (1989, 168). As soon as an animal  moves itself, “the future comes before the present” says Merleau-Ponty,  “a field of space-time has been opened: there is a beast there; the space  in question is inhabited, animated” (1994, 206).  Even at this stage of the epoché, the zoo-anthropological distinction  remains undecided. Nothing tells me whether this Alter Ego is man or  beast. Animalia—animals in the largest sense—are “objectivities of a  particular kind,” objectivities inhabited by subjectivities: “I apprehend  them as Bodies [Leiber], that is, I feel by empathy that in them there is  an Ego-subject” (1989, 164).14 One cannot help but see some visible and  sensible things as having a hidden side, not merely in the sense that one  could circumnavigate them to peek at their bunny tails, but in the sense  that there is an invisible dimension to them, un creux, not “constituted by  our thought, but lived as a variant of our own corporeality” (Merleau- Ponty 1994, 338). The concept of “Ego-subject” should not confuse us;  Husserl is here still speaking of animalia because “even the beast has  something like an egoic structure”: “Beasts are subjects of a conscious  life like us. Through such a conscious life they have in a certain way also  a ‘life-world’ as their own” (1973b, 177/1995, 194).15 Neither subjectivity  14. Husserl refers to animated bodies as Animalia and to animals other than  men as Tiere, beasts. Animalia are “primally present Corporeal bodies with  appresented interiority.” 15.

Husserl 1973b,  </page> <page sequence="12"> 58 Christiane Bailey nor intersubjectivity is thus proper to human beings because, like us,  “animals understand each other mutually”: Animals of a species have their own mode of being-for-another and  of being-with-another . . . They are in empathetic relationships and  understand each other, they are known to each other by instinct and  by experience—we understand them, we have experience of them in  this way, at least when it comes to “higher” animals. (Husserl 1973a,  623/1995, 215) The scare quotes on “higher” show Husserl was well aware this  denomination is relative to our human predicament. In his writings  on animals, a self-conscious anthropocentrism is at work. Whereas  Heidegger thought the essence of animal life should be uncovered by  considering animals as remote from human life as possible, Husserl  thought we should start with the familiar and proceed toward the  unknown. In our everyday experience, we do not encounter animals as  “estranged living beings,” or “merely living beings” as Heidegger puts  it,16 but rather “as cattle, as horses, as swallows, etc.”: As men, we experience animals first as being there with us in our familiar  surrounding world and as being dangerous, or at times dangerous,  as being excited or violent, etc. or as harmless or friendly. Then, we  understand animals in their being-together. Of course, we first find  the generative experiences and instincts in us and, from there, we  understand, or think we understand, how the animals live generatively  together. . . . But no matter how we expand our experience, men and  beasts, men of different races, animals of different species, are there  from the very beginning in the world that is for us and belong to  the world that is given to us in the respective modes of familiar and  foreign, and thus the world of animals . . . is always already outlined.  (Husserl 1973a, 623/1995, 215) The world of animals is sketched from the very beginning. To borrow Heidegger’s  terms in a way he would surely find objectionable, not only is Dasein  always-already a being-with others (Mitdasein), but also a being-with  177: “Auch das Tier hat so etwas wie eine Ichstruktur . . . Tiere, animalische  Wesen, sind wie wir Subjekt eines Bewuβtseinslebens, in dem ihnen in gewisser  Weise auch ‘Umwelt’ als die ihre in Seinsgewiβheit gegeben ist.” 16. The expression Nur-Lebenden, merely alive (1986, 346), not only reveals that  Heidegger refuses to distinguish between kinds of animals, but he goes as far as  refusing any ontologically relevant distinction between kinds of life—animals or  plants (1995, 179, 188, and 191).  </page> <page sequence="13"> Kinds of Life 59 other animals.17 Husserl even went as far as asking himself why he called some  animated bodies animals instead of men: “But we must first ask: why  do I call them beasts and why do I distinguish them from men? Perhaps  because of their completely different type of living corporeality?”  (1973a, 622/1995, 214). However different their corporeality might  be, animals are given as other ego-subjects, as having a conscious life  [Bewuβtseinslebens] like mine. How do I get to know this? How do I  know that animals as outwardly different as lions and whales have “a  conscious life like us”? Husserl’s answer will also be Merleau-Ponty’s— on account of my own lived body: “This we know by the perception of  the animal body that is ours” (1994, 270). Analogical apprehension of  others is not constructed, not the consequence of a reflection; rather,  I perceive others as having “a perceiving side”: “I perceive others as  perceiving” (271). This is only possible because I myself am a perceiving  being; “it is because I perceive that the Other is possible for me as  another being perceiving the same ‘tangible’ as me” (287). My own  perceiving and moving body is thus the condition of possibility for any  other perceiving and self-moving body. Once we grant that our body  is “the measurement of the world,” un étalon des choses (279), we cannot  lure ourselves with any so-called objective account of animals. Without  this primordial Einfühlung, no animal could stand out against the bio- physiological fabric of the world. The Other as a Variation of Myself; the Animal as a Variation of  Humanity We are now in a better position to understand the meaning of Husserl’s  strange principle according to which “for man, there can only be men;  animals are a variant of humanity.”18 Animals are variants of humanity  the same way other men are variations of myself. Or rather, animals are  variants of variants of myself, because their lives are apprehended through  empathy in a derivative sense: “we meet animals in our life-world through  an empathy which is a resembling modification of an inter-human  empathy.”19 While human beings are attained through “intentional  modifications” or variations (Abwandlungen) of myself, abnormal ego- 17. In his 1929–30 lecture course, Heidegger says that, even though there  could be something like a “going along with (Mitgehen)” animals, there is no  being-with (Mitsein) animals. This should go without saying because being-with  is an existential structure of Dasein, which means—at least for the Heidegger of  Being and Time and beyond—man. 18. Quoted by Merleau-Ponty (1994, 110–1). 19. Husserl, Ms. C 11 III, 15–16: “Die Tiere finden wir in unserer Welt vor durch  eine Einfühlung, die eine assimilierende Abwandlung der mitmenschlichen  Einfühlung ist” (cited in Depraz 2001, 175). </page> <page sequence="14"> 60 Christiane Bailey subjects are attained through “privative modifications” of myself.  According to Husserl, I need to “cross out” aspects of my experience  to lay hands on an alien subjectivity. This derivative status is proper  not only to animals, but also children, madmen and strangers. All of  them are part of this select club Husserl calls the “abnormals”—alien  subjectivities requiring a privative methodology. Husserl’s approach is  based on the principle according to which “abnormality must first be  constituted as such; and it can do so only on the basis of an intrinsically  antecedent normality” (1991, 125):  Among the problems of abnormality, the problem of non-human  animality and that of the levels of ‘higher and lower’ brutes are  included. Relative to the brute, man is, constitutionally speaking, the  normal case—just as I myself am the primal norm constitutionally for  all other men. Brutes are essentially constituted for me as abnormal  variants of my humanness. (1991, 126) At first, Husserl's claim according to which animals are variants or  variations of humanity seems to merely have an epistemological  status—he wants to underline the limitations of our understanding.  However, he seems to construe this claim as possessing real ontological  value (i.e., the distinction between layers of consciousness will amount  to a distinction between kinds of life). Consciousness-stratification  thus becomes the guiding thread to the ontology of life. Like Aristotle,  Husserl distinguished layers or strata (Schichten) covering each other: the  plant lives only by pulsion (Trieb) and is “deprived of psychic layer.”20  Animals also live through “egological acts,” but lack “the layer of  theoretical thought,” man’s prerogative. Since upper layers presuppose  the lower ones, man—as a living being endowed with animal Ego and  rational mind—will have all layers. Being the most complete or perfect  of animals, man represents the measure by which other intentional  layers or other souls can be understood. Husserl knew this stratification  of consciousness brought us back to the ancient doctrines of the soul: Notwithstanding the undoubtedly essential unfragmentability [of  the flux of consciousness], there exists, on the other hand, a certain  partition of the soul, namely, a distinction between strata in the  soul, corresponding to strata of consciousness. Higher levels can be  missing, and then the signification of the soul is quite different, as  occurs for example, in the case of the soul which is constantly sleeping  and in which no cogito is accomplished. Another example is the soul  of the brute animal, in which the stratum of theoretical thought in the  20. For Husserl, there is “a certain division of the soul, a distinction between  psychic layers [Seelenschichten] which corresponds to layers of consciousness  [Bewußtseinschichten]” (1989, 134). </page> <page sequence="15"> Kinds of Life 61 pregnant sense is lacking, etc. Phenomenology convinces us that the  ancient doctrines of the “parts of the soul” and the kind of soul actually  contain meaningful problems and, what is more, phenomenological  problems. (Husserl 1989, 134) As we know, Heidegger will criticize this view of man as “a compound  of body, soul and mind [ein leiblich seelish geistige Einheit]” (1986, 48). This  would precisely be Scheler’s fundamental mistake: “his conviction that  man is the being who unites within himself all the levels of being— physical being, the being of plants and animals, and the specifically  spiritual being” (Heidegger 1995, 192). The Animal as Radical Other: Roadmap to a Wordless Zoology   For Heidegger, man is not the recapitulation of all living beings, but  another mode of being. Conversely, animal life is not a variant of ours, an  impoverished form of existence, but a mode of being essentially different from  our own. Approaching animals in this way would allow us to respect their  alterity, their radical otherness, instead of considering them as defective  forms of humanity. Animals would be, as Françoise Dastur puts it, “the  Other par excellence,” “the Other with which Mitsein is impossible” (1995,  316). Answering to Derrida’s critique according to which Heidegger’s  privative stance on animals is a left-over of metaphysical humanism,  Dastur suggests understanding Heidegger’s notion of “privative  interpretation” in Sein und Zeit as a form of “negative theology,” of  mystical ontology which would only allow “speaking of the animal to  forbid speaking about it” (Dastur 1995, 306). Notwithstanding the fact  that Dastur’s interpretation opens very important questions and helps  to make sense of Heidegger’s unexpected principle according to which  we should “cross out” our own language in speaking about animals  (Heidegger 1995, 292), it nonetheless seems strange from a Heideggerian  standpoint to argue that our understanding of Being prevents a proper  access to animal life. Heidegger’s thinking rests on this simple, basic  premise: to human beings belong an understanding of being, of their  own being and of the being of entities which are not at their measure.  This is precisely Dasein’s ontological privilege: “Constitutive of its  understanding, Dasein possesses an understanding of the Being of all  entities of a character other than its own” (Heidegger 1986, 13). If the  distinction between humans and animals rests precisely on our capacity  to apprehend beings in their being, why can we not grasp animals as  they are in themselves? Why could we only speak of them “behind the  bars of quotation marks”?21 Where does this poverty of our language  21. In Difficult Freedom, Levinas recalls his imprisonment by the Nazis: “We were  subhuman, a gang of apes.” Their humanity, their language, was kept “behind  </page> <page sequence="16"> 62 Christiane Bailey and our understanding suddenly come from? For Dastur, “we have no  other choice than to see the animal from a privative stance” (1994, 289): We have nothing but a negative access to the being of the animal  because “life” is always for us human life, that is, a life able to interpret  itself, to understand itself. We can only conceptualize the life of what  is “merely” living by a work of abstraction. (Dastur 2003, 23) Because “in every interpretation, we always necessarily anticipate  ourselves,” any understanding of animals would turn out to be the  result of an anthropomorphic account (Dastur 1995, 298). This may, in  a sense, be true. As Kant once said “we can only judge an understanding  by means of our own understanding and therefore an intuition from  our own intuition” (1999, 314). Of course, Kant was speaking of God  here rather than animals. However, the principle applies to animals  just as well. If, as Husserl argues, “we understand animals through  our understanding of human beings,” then we might have to concede  anthropomorphism cannot be avoided altogether. 22 Anthropomorphism: Begging the Question of the “Properly Human”  Of course, anthropomorphism as projection of peculiarly human  characteristics onto animals is wrong by definition. But what should  be considered properly human? If I think of an opossum as having  emotions and intentions, am I projecting onto this animal exclusively  human properties? When I see a dog chasing a cat, whenever I describe  an animal as doing something, anything at all, am I being anthropomorphic?  Uexküll used to think so. At the beginning of his career, Uexküll was a  radical behaviorist who insisted on substituting “objective” terminology  for merely “subjective” descriptions. He thus avoided terms like “seeing,”  preferring “photoreception.” Eventually reconsidering his attempt  “to ‘clean up’ an impossibly anthropocentric nomenclature,” he then  became convinced that “it is fundamentally false to try to explain the  lives of animals mechanistically.”23 His goal became to uncover animals  as subjects, though not as human subjects. To achieve this, one must necessarily  reconsider what is properly human. Merleau-Ponty has shown how this  was possible when he reconsidered his position on the animal’s lack  of any symbolic activity between his first book The Structure of Behavior  (1942), and his later lecture course on nature. Heidegger, on the other  hand, does not seem open, when studying bees and other insects, to  the bars of quotation marks” and the only one who recognized them as humans  was a dog, a dog name Bobby (1990, 153). 22. Husserl, Ms K III 18, 39: “Wir verstehen aber Tiere auf dem Umweg über  das Menschenverstehen” (cited in Depraz 2001, 175).  23. Quoted by Harrington (1996, 42). </page> <page sequence="17"> Kinds of Life 63 reconsider what is proper to Dasein. The goal, as he said in The Basic  Problems of Phenomenology, is “to determine reductively, starting by what  is given to us as existent, what could be given to an animal that merely  lives but does not exist” (1975, 271). Everything happens as if animal  life could be deduced afterwards with what was left from the existential  analytic. But the problem is that there are not many leftovers for the  animal: the ontology of Dasein is so fundamental that it monopolizes  affection, orientation, understanding, and being-with as existential  structures.24  If avoiding Heidegger’s notions of being-in-a-world, of Befindlichkeit,  of unthematic and pre-reflexive understanding, and of being-with is  so difficult when describing animal life, could it be because these are  not fundamentally human structures after all? Could the existential  structures of Dasein be fundamentally animal structures? This may  come as a surprise for readers mainly familiar with Being and Time and  Heidegger’s later works, but he had granted earlier that affection  (Befindlichkeit), understanding (Verstehen), and being-with (Mitsein)  were not exclusive to human Dasein. The early Heidegger thought  Befindlichkeit belonged to any being endowed with perception because to  perceive is always to find oneself (befindet sich) pleasantly or unpleasantly  disposed toward what is perceived.25 In his SS 1926 lecture course, he  also acknowledged that a form of understanding belongs to animals.26  In a general way, before he restricts, in Being and Time, Dasein’s way of  being to humans, Heidegger was thinking of the animal as “a being for  whom living, being-in-itself, matters to it in some way” (2002b, 51), as  a “being to which we must attribute, in a formal way, the kind of being  which belongs to Dasein” (1970, 223). Even if Heidegger will eventually  change his mind about animal life—as Dilthey also did—and come  to plainly affirm that “the animal has no world, not even an Umwelt”  (Heidegger 1983, 54), this does not change the fact that, while he was  elaborating Dasein’s existential structures (roughly between 1924 and  1926), Heidegger used to grant to animals Dasein’s way of being. We do  not have the space here to offer an interpretation of this anthropological  24. To have a world is a condition of possibility for sensible affection (Heidegger  1986, 137) and “orientation is a structure of being-in-a-world” (Heidegger 1970,  321).  25. Heidegger 2002b, 122: “Affects (pathe) are not mental states, but refer to  the disposition of the living in his world [Befindlichkeit des Lebenden in seiner Welt], how he  stands to something, how he lets something affect or concern [angehen] him.” 26. Heidegger 1993, 207–8: “Understanding belongs to the mode of Being  of animals. To say that something is understood means that it is manifest in  its being such and such: it is no longer concealed. In understanding, there is  something like truth, aletheia: that which is unconcealed, not covered over, but  on the contrary, uncovered.” </page> <page sequence="18"> 64 Christiane Bailey shift in Heidegger’s thinking, but it is important for our discussion to  notice that this fundamental turn goes hand-in-hand with his strong  refusal of distinctions between kinds of living beings—a fundamental  feature of his thinking in Being and Time and beyond.27 An Expanded World: Being-with Animals  A philosophical zoology will unfold in a very different way whether one  starts with lower animals, insects, and invertebrates or with so-called  “higher” animals, like cats and dogs, and obviously chimps.28 Which  animal should be the spokespersons of animal life? Should we start,  like Husserl, with higher animals that are most familiar to us or, like  Heidegger, with lower animals that are most perplexing? Perhaps one  should relinquish terms like “higher” and “lower” in favor of others,  like “familiar” and “unfamiliar.” This would mean embracing the idea  that we need to start by what we know best and, at the same time, a  self-conscious reminder that our investigations are inevitably tainted  by anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism. Moreover, to call  “familiar” those animals we do understand and “unfamiliar” those we  do not leaves some room for flexibility. It leaves open the possibility that  very strange animals may become familiar ones. This possibility is best  exemplified by Uexküll, whose strolls in the foreign worlds of rather  puzzling animals uncovered dimensions of these worlds to which we  would otherwise be blind. When becoming familiar with animals, we are in the same situation  as Husserl’s bird that can fly off to another planet. The bird, reminds  Merleau-Ponty, “does not have a double ground” but “from the sole fact  that it is the same bird, it unites the two planets into a single ground”  (1994, 110). Unable to “think without this reference to a ground that  we ourselves always are” (1994, 111), this ground is nevertheless not a  fixed entity, but a domain that can be expanded. And Husserl knew  this when, dealing with abnormal subjectivities, he refrained from  thinking of them as merely impaired.29 As Depraz has shown, abnormal  subjects are not “deficient subjects who would be missing something,”  27. In order to follow Heidegger’s logic, we must stop thinking of animals and  plants as occupying different ontological planes because they all belong to the  same mode of being : life, mere life [Nur-noch-Leben] (1986, 50). The essence of  life—world deprivation—holds true for animals and plants (1995, 179, 188, and  191).  28. This is best exemplified by Levinas who says very different things about  animal life whether he speaks of a snake or a dog. Although he did not know  whether snakes have a face, he surely knew a dog who had a name (Levinas,  1990). 29. Husserl is well aware that they are called “abnormal” in reference to the  norm that I always am. </page> <page sequence="19"> Kinds of Life 65 but alien subjectivities that “enable us and compel us to learn and to  become familiar with unknown dimensions of ourselves and with new  horizons of our world. They enrich our self and enlarge our world”  (2001, 174). Can we think of animals as having access to dimensions of  the world unknown to us? Can an animal teach me something, anything  at all, about the world? Husserl certainly did think so. Talking of a  dog he would go hunting with, he described the dog’s racing through  the woods, looking for prey and, upon discovery, loudly indicating  the wounded animal’s location (1973, 167). What is happening here?  Can an animal really indicate something? Can it intend to indicate  something to me? As we know, Heidegger maintains in his WS 1929-30 lecture  course that it is not possible for an animal to express something  meaningful, because animal expressions are “mere psophoi,” “noises that  lack meaning” (1995, 307). But this presentation of animal voices as  “unarticulated sounds” “triggered off due to some physiological state”  clashes from his earlier account of animal voice. In his SS 1924 lecture  course, Heidegger distinguishes, following Aristotle, animal phonē from  mere noises precisely because the former is meaningful noise (psophoi  semantikos) in the genuine sense of meaning something, being able to  indicate something (2002b, 50–55). With their voices, animals do not only  communicate feelings of pain and pleasure, but also the approach of a  predator or the location of food.30 This indication (Anzeigen), however,  has nothing to do with apophantic or declarative speech: by warning  his fellows of a predator’s approach, the animal seeks to bring other  animals to a particular disposition (fear), in order to encourage certain  behavior (flight). The languages of animals do not aim at making true  or false statements, but are essentially rhetorical in that they aim at  doing something or at making others do something (Kisiel 1995, 295). As the  early Heidegger used to say, an animal voice “gives no report about  the being-at-hand of what is pleasing: but rather this indication and  crying out is in itself an enticing or warning. Enticing and warning have  the character of addressing itself to.” They have their ground in being-with- one-another:  Enticing and warning already show that animals are with one another.  Being-with-one-another [Miteinandersein] becomes manifest precisely in  the specific being-character of animals as phonē. It is neither exhibited  nor manifested that something as such is there. Animals do not  subsequently come along to ascertain that something is present: they  only indicate it within the orbit of their animalistic having-to-do. Since  30. Heidegger is here following Aristotle who argued that animals can use  their voice to communicate among themselves (pro hermeneian alloesis) and to  teach something to one another (The Parts of Animals, 660a17–b2). </page> <page sequence="20"> 66 Christiane Bailey animals indicate the threatening, alarming and so on, they signal in  this indicating of the being-there of the world, their own being in the  world. (Heidegger 2002b, 54) This last point is of capital importance: the animal indicates not only  that it finds itself in a world, but also how it finds itself in the world.  Animals communicate with each other and with us, even if they do  not have language. To my knowledge, Heidegger’s analysis of animal  Miteinandersein is his first comprehensive sketch of what will become, in  Being and Time, the structure of Being-with, of Mitsein: proof that animals  can indeed teach us something.
