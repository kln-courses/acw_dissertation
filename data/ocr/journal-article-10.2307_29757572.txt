<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Iconographic Evidence for the Religious Nature of Indus Seals and Inscriptions by BENILLE PRIYANKA The purpose of this paper is to bring to light some recent observations I have made regarding the hitherto undeciphered Indus valley script. These observations, which are based on iconographic clues from Indus seals and tablets, suggest that some of the standing 'man' signs in the Indus script may ideographically indicate 'divinity'. The paper expands on this suggestion, leading to a series of observations on possible identification of other Indus signs as standardized iconic imagery. My suggestion is that some Indus inscriptions are ideographically rendered religious and ritualistic narratives, comprised of sequences of standardized Indus signs. It is important to understand the function of the different forms of the 'man' sign in the Indus script as they are one of the categories which has the highest number of graphic variations in the signary. Out of approximately 420 Indus signs given in Mahadevan's concordance (Mahadevan 1977: 32), 46 graphic variations of 'man' sign have been recorded, which is approximately l/9th of the entire signary. These high statistical occurrences suggest that the 'man' signs had a central role in the Indus inscriptions. If these 'man' signs represent divinities, as my observations suggest, it is highly probable that the context of many of the Indus seals and inscriptions, or at least those associated with the 'man' signs, are of a religious or ritualistic nature. Of this corpus of 'man' signs, I will focus on the following variations (Fig. 1): ? * K * # ? b j? 4* ? V *? *? ** ^ W W &amp; IP Fig. 1 - a.

M-481 A: Fig. 2a, b\ drawing of the inscription on M-481 A: Fig. 2c) provided me a clue that the 'man' sign occurring towards the end of the inscription could be an ideogram for divinity. In the inscription on this tablet there is the so-called 'horned man' sign [1], which occurs bracketed by two zigzag lines on either side, as the fifth sign in a sequence (from right to left) of six. The last sign (sixth from right) depicts a seated man holding out what appears to be a jar-like vessel to this 'horned man'. This provides us iconographic evidence to indicate that the 'horned man' sign represents a divinity that could have commanded adoration and reverence from the Indus people who may have offered jar-like vessels to him as offerings.

Inscription on tablet M-481 A. (After Mahadevan 1977: 82, text no. 2846). Mahadevan recently suggested that the so called 'incense burner' or the 'standard' (Fig. 3), which appears on a large number of Indus seals normally below the head of the so-called 'unicorn' is the press used for the making of soma (Mahadevan 1984: 165-86; 1985: 219-66; 1994: 435-45). Perhaps what the kneeling man offers to the divinity represented by the 'horned man' sign in the tablet M-481 A (Fig. 2) is the Fig. 3 - 'Sacred filter standard' on unicorn seals. (After Mahadevan 1993: fig. 39.1). 32 [2]</page><page sequence="3">soma drink. Or, it may be some other offering. If it could be determined that a soma cult existed in association with the Indus seals, this would have far reaching implications. Possehl has recently commented that: [...] in various parts of the Rgveda a press used for the preparation of soma is described. Soma is a hallucinogenic drink prepared for Vedic rituals, also noted in the Avesta as homa. By comparing the Vedic description with the images of the standard from Mature Harappan contexts Mahadevan is able to make a case that it is not a stand or standard at all, but the very press used for the making of soma. Some of the correspondences are very close, and this side of Mahadevan s argument cannot be simply dismissed. If Mahadevan s hypothesis is true it has many implications. If the inhabitants of the ancient cities of Indus participated in the same rituals as the peoples of the Rgveda and Avesta, they might thereby be Aryans. The peoples of the Rgveda and Avesta may have acquired soma from the Harappans but that thought would require an important rethinking of the history of Indo-European peoples. The presence of the soma filter on the Indus seals might also imply that part of the message of the seals dealt with this topic. (Possehl 1996: 35). Possehl's comments about Mahadevan's hypothesis are worthy of further consideration. If it can be argued convincingly that the different 'man signs' in the Indus script represent divinities, it would contribute to the understanding that these seals and tablets were mainly religious in nature. Therefore, the suggestion of soma or some other ritual drink as libation offerings for the Indus gods is not impossible, based upon the iconography of the tablets. Observation 2: In looking for further occurrences of offerings on Indus seals and tablets to support my argument that the 'man' signs represent divinities, I came across four more examples (Figs. 4-5) noticed earlier by the Russian team that attempted the decipherment of the Indus script (Volcok 1976: 117). All four tablets are from Mohenjodaro and three have identical inscriptions (tablet nos. M-478 A, M-479 A, M-480 A are identical; M-453 B). Fig. 4 - a-c. Three identical tablets from Mohenjodaro depicting an offering of a jar-like vessel by a devotee to a sacred tree. Tablet nos. M-478 X, M-479 A, M-480 A. (After Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 115). [3] 33</page><page sequence="4">In regard to the identical signary of the tablets M-478 A, 479 A and 480 A (Fig. 4), the Soviets said the following: Some scenes on the Proto-Indian seals and amulets undoubtedly denote offerings [...] In the scene 'offering to the tree' there is a kneeling adorant with a round bottom vessel in his hand in front of the tree. (Volcok 1976: 117). Parpola has made similar observations and commented further regarding the identical inscriptions of these tablets: In the moulded tablets M-478 and M-479, the sign combination of 4+U stands next to an iconographic scene where a kneeling worshipper extends a pot shaped like the U-formed sign towards a tree. Apparently the tree is sacred, and the man is presenting the pot (or according to the inscription on M-478 and M-479, four pots) to it as an offering. (Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: XVI). The above observations by the Soviets and Parpola are convincing. However, they have not ventured to understand the importance of the bracketed 'man' sign towards the end of this inscription. This is especially true given the sacred context of the iconographic scenes and its relation to the sign combination they were discussing. With the help of my observation 1 for tablet M-481 A (Fig. 2) (that a kneeling worshipper offers a jarlike vessel to the bracketed 'horned man' sign which implies divinity), I think we can reasonably argue that the similar figure (although without horns) occurring towards the end of these tablets (M-478 A, M-479 A and M-480 A) is also an ideographic representation of divinity. This implies that the receiver of the offering to the sacred tree (Fig. 4) is the divinity represented towards the end of the inscription by the 'man' sign. Given this context of 'offering to the sacred tree', it is also possible that the last sign [2] is a standardized representation of the sacred tree itself. Therefore, the complete message of the inscription can be interpreted as: four pot offerings to the divinity of/in the sacred tree. This ideographic expression of the inscription correlates with the iconographic depiction on the tablet: seated/kneeling man offering a jarlike vessel to the sacred tree. Fig. 5 - Offering of a jarlike vessel to a seated deity by a devotee. A tablet from Mohenjodaro, M-453 B. (After Parpola 1994a: 226, fig. 13.2). 34 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Two tablets share another iconography that supports my reading of the four previous tablets. These two tablets (nos. M-453 B [Fig. 5] and M-454 B) depict a seated deity on a throne flanked by two kneeling worshippers. The worshipper on the left side offers a jarlike vessel to the seated deity while the worshipper on the right raises his arms towards the seated deity in adoration. Thus, the iconography of these Indus tablets indicates that deities received jarlike offerings from worshippers. There is a difference in style, that is in how form is manipulated, between the 'figures' on these two tablets and the 'signs' on the previous tablets, even though they are, I believe, expressing the same idea. The Figure 5 tablet depicts a tiny relief narrative; the figures are schematic, but fully defined. On the Figure 2 and 4 tablets, the figures are more abstracted, more signs than images. In other words, the Figure 2 and 4 tablets have what appears to be pictographic writing, while the Figure 5 tablet has an artistic scene or narrative. My argument is that if an artistic iconography can be identified as appearing in pictographic form, a similar iconographic meaning can be applied to both. The 'man' sign variations (Fig. 1) may suggest a pantheon of divinities or different aspects of one or many divinities. Most variations are based on combinations of symbols. For example, if my identification of the comb-sign is a sacred tree, its combination with the standing man-sign might indicate a tree divinity or deity of the tree. There are a number of ways in which these two signs are linked together [3]. Identification of the Indus signs [4] as standardized representations of sacred trees will be argued more fully below. Therefore the following Indus signs [5] could also be identified as representing tree divinities. Observation 3: Strong iconographic evidence in support of a divine figure in an Indus inscription itself is provided by two identical tablet inscriptions from Mohenjodaro (tablet nos. M-452 A, M-1400 A). Since they are identical inscriptions only tablet M-1400 A is provided here. The inscription is comprised of five signs (Fig. 6). The fourth sign from the right, which is bracketed on either side by two zigzag lines, is not clear in the published photographs. Mahadevan's concordance of Indus Script has published a drawing of the inscription (Mahadevan 1977: 82, text no. 2851) without providing this sign (Fig. 7). However, it seems that in the original tablet this sign is fairly clear as Parpola has recently published a drawing of it (Fig. 8) (Parpola 1994a: 70, fig. 5.1). It is clear from the drawing that this bracketed sign is a unique iconographic representation of a horned mythological figure which most probably depicts a deity. Fig. 9 is a reconstruction of the complete inscription which includes this horned figure. Thus it is apparent that these two tablets with identical inscriptions from Mohenjodaro include a representation of the bust of a bracketed horned figure. Compared to the bracketed standing man-sign with horns represented on the Figure [5] 35</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 6 - An iconographically depicted 'horned man' in an inscription i.e., the bracketed sign (fourth from right). Tablet no. M-1400 A. (After Shah &amp; Parpola 1991: 187). Fig. 7 - Inscription on tablet M-1400 A. (After Mahadevan 1977: 82, text no. 2851). Fig. 8 - Recently published drawing of the 'horned man' in tablet M-1400 A. (After Parpola 1994a: 70, fig. 5.1). Fig. 9 - Reconstructed Inscription on tablet M-1400 A. 2 tablet, which I identified as a deity, I also identify the bust as that of a deity. Again, the two representations show how the 'same' symbol can be indicated graphically by different degrees of abstraction. Observation 4: Another tablet, M-1405 A (Fig. 10) that I read as a relief narrative (rather than as pictographs) combines figures as signs and images. It depicts a man between a 'composite man' sign [6] and an image of a bull drinking or feeding at a trough. The composite man is made up of a standing man with a yoke and, for a head, the 'jar' sign. The man in the center points down with his right hand at the trough while pointing his left arm specifically towards the head [7] of the 'composite man' sign. Although this sign [8] is often said to be a jar because of its shape, it most probably represents a bull's or buffalo's head and horns. Parpola has recently mentioned that this sign [9] may be a standardized representation of a 'cow's head' (Parpola 1994a: 36 [6]</page><page sequence="7">104, fig. 7.4), comprising its resemblance to a number of stylized animal head depictions found on Early Harappan pottery from Rahman Dheri (Parpola 1994a: 106, fig. 1 Ac-T) and Near Eastern glyptics (Parpola 1994a: 106, fig. 1 Aa-b). Kenoyer has also expressed recently that the sign [10] may be a pictograph of a bull with horns, or a handled container (Kenoyer 1998: 71). This tablet is a valuable piece of evidence because here an Indus 'composite man' sign is directly connected to other iconographic elements on the same tablet that is the bull and the trough. (It is important also to note that this Indus 'composite man' sign [11] appears alone on a number of Indus seals, thus revealing its ideographic nature). This sign, with a bull's/buffalo s head and horns holding a yoke with hanging 'pots' may represent an Indus water/fertility god, quite similar to the contemporary Mesopotamian water god Enki who is sometimes depicted on cylinder seals holding pots with flowing water or water springing from his shoulders implying main rivers of Mesopotamia (Jacobsen 1976: 94). This Indus divinity must be at least partly a bull or buffalo deity. It seems that the human figure in the middle with the raised hand gestures is a devotee. From his gesture (possibly of veneration or conducting a ritual) towards the Indus 'composite man' sign (with a bull/buffalo head/headdress and holding a yoke with hanging 'pots') the later [12] can be identified as one ideographically depicted divinity. The narrative on the tablet seems to be a religious one. The idea may be that the bull drinking from a trough is equivalent to feeding a divinity as represented by the ideogram [13]. That the head of the divinity itself is represented with the Indus sign [14] denoting the bull's/buffalo's head, implies that the bull and what it drinks are of reverence and the bull in fact may have a strong ritual connection to or be another form of this divinity. This drink may well be the soma drink that Mahadevan has already observed regarding the so-called 'standard' on Indus seals. Other possibilities than soma cannot also be ruled out, but it appears to be a libation fed to the bull with the ultimate intention of satisfying the divinity [15] represented on the tablet. Fig. 10 - A tablet from Mohenjodaro. (After Shah &amp; Parpola 1991: 189, tablet no. M-1405 A). Observation 5: Another narrative image that has a direct parallel in the Indus signary [16] is the horned man with a bow. This image-type appears on copper tablets found at Mohenjodaro (M-582 B, 583 B, 584 B, 586 B etc.), which depict a striding male [7] 37</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 11 - A copper tablet from Mohenjodaro. (After Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 149, tablet no. M-588 B). with horns and holding a bow (Fig. 11). If the man-sign [17] indicates divinity, then the copper tablet image would be a more complete visual depiction of the deity. He may be a mythic or deified hero, but his appearance in the signary indicates his importance. Observation 6: Like the bow-man image and sign, there are examples of a figure holding a club represented in both images and signs. The club-man has been discussed by Parpola, three images of which occur on a single amulet from Harappa. The figures have bulls legs and hold a club over their shoulders (Fig. 12). Each has beside himself a separate bulls head sign [18]. Parpola has pointed out the relationship between these figures and the club-man sign [19], and has suggested that the separate 'jar' sign may be a distinct word, probably the name of the deity depicted on the amulet or a title applied to gods (Parpola 1994a: 91, fig. 6.3a-c). The 'jar' sign has the highest frequency of occurrence in the Indus '"Nr. Fig. 12 - a-c. Three sides of an amulet from Harappa. (After Parpola 1994a: 91, fig. 6.3a-c). 38 [8]</page><page sequence="9">signary, some 1395 examples according to Mahadevan's calculations. Because of its frequent placement at the end of inscriptions, Parpola has suggested that it functions grammatically as a suffix. If, on the other hand, it represents the head of a bull, a possibility mentioned by Parpola in passing and for which I am arguing here, it may have different or at least additional significance. The club-man on the amulet is part bull, part human, suggesting the therianthropic nature of the man-sign with a bull head discussed above. Indeed, the bull head sign on the amulet may suggest the club-man deity in a sign form. Fig. 13 - An ivory plaque from Mohenjodaro. (After Shah &amp; Parpola 1991: 250, M-1653 A). The club-man image also occurs on an ivory plaque from Mohenjodaro, M-1653 A (Fig. 13). The narrative image holds the club over his shoulder with his arms akimbo, producing a particular outline that in fact is reflected in many variations of the club? man signary (Fig. 14). *f *# * v* ?* v*1 a 1?"9 ?H?M *'?? fMOtf ?-t? ft-Ul W-IOW *??*?? n-tti N-ft?

[9] 39</page><page sequence="10">These two examples suggest that the so-called 'club man' sign [20] and the other Indus sign [21] also may belong to an ideographic category which represent divinity. Possibility of All Standing cMan Signs Representing Divinities The hitherto identified 'man' signs with graphic variations as representing divinities provide us a clue for a generalization that the whole series of standing 'man' signs in the signary may well represent divinities. Their graphic variations are mainly due to being combined with different symbols which may also be of religious nature. The following 'man' signs which are already discussed reveal a very high frequency of occurrence in the Indus inscriptions compared to the other forms of 'man' signs (Fig. 15). ? f3J^ &lt;0 s? Fig. 15 - Indus 'man' signs with a high frequency of occurrence. (After Mahadevan 1977: 717, table 1) They may be the most venerated/respected or feared divinities of the Indus pantheon. The 'composite man' sign [22] with bull head [23] and holding a yoke with two hanging 'jars' appears alone in quite a number of Indus seals and tablets. It has a high frequency of occurrence with 126 times in the Indus corpus of inscriptions (Mahadevan 1977: 717, table 1). Such occurrence reveals that the sign represents a prominent Indus deity with a bull/buffalo identity or wearing bull/buffalo headdress who may most probably be a water or fertility god. An interesting variation of this 'composite man' sign has been found on an oval shaped terracotta object (K-79 A) from Kalibangan (Fig. 16). In this example the sign seems to be of a highly composite nature. The body of the sign has a close resemblance to the Indus 'fish' sign, although the 'fins' are absent. From the left shoulder of the composite figure emerges the standardized sign for a sacred tree [24]. The bull/buffalo headdress [25] is fixed onto the upper part of the sign. Most interestingly, what appears to be a human head is attached to the upper left side of the bull/buffalo head. This depiction of a human head combined to the buffalo head 40 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 16 - a. An oval shaped terracotta object from Kalibangan, K-79 A. On the obverse is the sole occurrence of the highly 'composite man' sign: Noteworthy are the interchangeability of human head and buffalo head, fish shaped body, sign [170] emerging from the left shoulder which may represent a sacred tree. (After Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 314). b. Drawing of composite sign on K-79 A. can be regarded as convincing iconographic evidence that the two signs are complementary in meaning and are interchangeable. This complex composite sign appears alone on one side of this terracotta object. On the other side a large star-like sign occurs (K-79 B). It may be recalled that the famous image on the so called Troto Siva' seal and a number of other images on Indus seals and tablets have buffalo horns. This characteristic fits with the variations of horned man signs [26] in the Indus signary, which may in fact be the abstract renderings of the iconographically elaborate images themselves. Hence I propose that majority of such horned man signs represent deities. Some of these horned man signs may represent priests, ancestors, or mythic heroes, but they all participate in some way with the supernatural or divine. Furthermore, when one considers different forms of the 'man' signs occurring in the Indus inscriptions, many of them are depicted holding other Indus signs (Fig. 17). Some 'man' signs are apparently depicted holding the jarlike vessel. The latter also provides evidence to strengthen the hypotheses that the 'man' sign may be an ideographic representation of divinity and the Indus sign-jarlike vessel-he is holding [27] may represent an offering given to him by a devotee. However, the last two signs in Fig. 17 may be devotees who are in a kneeling/seated position and seem to be offering jars to the divinities. Extending this observation by analogy to other [11] 41</page><page sequence="12">z jfi z Oj* i &amp; * Fig. 17 - Some Indus 'man' signs with a lesser frequency of occurrence. (After Mahadevan 1977:717, table 1). Indus signs (Fig. 17) which were held by the Indus man' signs, we may get a positive clue that such Indus signs are also of highly religious origin. The identification of signs and images of deities on Indus seals argues that they had religious meanings and implications. We know that some of the seals were used for making impressions in clay. An overriding administrative or economic function, however, seems less likely given their religious character. Instead, their amuletic function may be emphasized. Possehl has pointed out in this regard that: Seals constitute the most prominent category of inscribed objects. There are a few impressions of these seals on the surface of a pot or a lump of wet clay, so their use as seals is not in question, but the number of impressions, especially on lumps of clay used to seal a package or container, is really very small, 50 in fact. The Harappan seals may not have been made to create the kind of seal based administrative records known from Mesopotamia. (Possehl 1996: 23). Narrative Nature of Indus Inscriptions The narrative nature of Indus inscriptions becomes remarkably evident from another set of tablets from Harappa (Fig. 18) recently published by Kenoyer (1998: 115). A close iconographic parallel to these tablet inscriptions from Harappa can be demonstrated by a tablet from Mohenjodaro (M-488 C) which depicts an elaborate iconographic representation of a religious narrative (Fig. \9a). The same narrative is the subject matter of the famous 'fig deity seal' or the 'divine adoration seal' from 42 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Mohenjodaro (M-1186 A) (Shah &amp; Parpola 1991: 139), and has been repeated on two more tablets. One is from Mohenjodaro, M-442 A (Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 109), and the other from Harappa, H-177 B (Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 209). Hence this religious theme seems to be a quite popular one among the Indus people (Fig. 19a). Fig. 18 shows the four sides of molded faience tablets from Harappa with three narrative scenes and an Indus text recently published by Kenoyer (1998: 115). These narrative scenes and the text have been duplicated on a series of small tablets from Harappa. When comparing the Indus text (Figs. 18&lt;^ and 19b) on these small tablets from Harappa with the narrative scene on the tablet from Mohenjodaro, M-488 C (Fig. 19a), a remarkable parallel can be observed (Fig. 19a and b). Here (Fig. 19) I am comparing a narrative depiction using images (Fig. 19^) to an inscription using signs (Fig. 19b). The one that is easier to interpret is the first, as it is telling a story with clearly defined images. My suggestion is that one can use the narrative with defined images (Fig. 19 a) to read the inscription (Fig. 19b), and that the inscription tells the same story. Kenoyer has mentioned that in the Harappa tablets' inscription (Fig. 19b) the first character from the right (1) appears to be some form of animal (Kenoyer 1998: 115). This rather standardized animal-like character as an ideographic sign seems to be correlating to the Ram (3) depicted in the middle of the narrative scene on the Mohenjodaro tablet, M-488 C (Fig. 19a). The third character from the right (3) [28] of the Harappa tablets seems to be a standardized rendering of the seated priest or priestess (2) of the Mohenjodaro tablet who is performing a ritual or worshipping the c Fig. 18 - Recently found four sided small molded faience tablets from Harappa. a. Man fighting with a short-horned bull. b. Seated deity and worshipper, c. Standing deity with horned headdress, d. Script. (After Kenoyer 1998: 115, fig. 6.25a-d).

Script on one side of faience tablets from Harappa. (After Kenoyer 1998: 115, fig. 6.25J). deity in the pipal tree (4). The fifth, which is the last character of the Harappa tablets, is a 'man' sign [29] which seems to correlate to the deity in the pipal tree at the end of the narrative scene on the Mohenjodaro tablet. Despite the lack of the pipal tree and the short stool with offerings (?) on the Harappa tablets, the other noteworthy difference is the occurrence of the so called 'Jar' sign [30] as second and fourth characters in the Harappa inscription. Assuming the Jar' sign is actually a bull/buffalo head representing divinity, then its occurrence on the Harappa tablets can be explained as additional emphasis of divinity and sacredness to which the seated priest and animal respectively are facing. Finally the whole sequence of signs in the Harappa tablets is directed towards the 'man' sign at the end representing divinity. This is borne out by the fact that the animal and seated priest signs are facing the direction of the 'man' sign. The 'man' sign is closely correlated in its positioning to the papal deity of the Mohenjodaro tablet which also occurs at the end of the narrative scene. A counterargument can be made that the positioning of the animal and the seated priest of the Mohenjodaro tablet is reversed compared to the Harappa tablets' inscriptions and does not follow the same sequence. But out of the four examples containing this narrative scene, two have the animal after the priest/worshipper (M-1186 A, H-177 B), while the other two (M-442 A, M-488 C) have the animal before the priest/worshipper. Therefore, whether the animal precedes or follows the priest seems not to be a rigid convention in this popular Indus narrative scene. That the fourth side of these four-sided tablets from Harappa, that with an inscription in signs (Figs. 18&lt;i, 19?), can be interpreted as telling a narrative is supported by the other three sides each depicting a narrative in images. These 44 [14]</page><page sequence="15">include a) man fighting with a bull in front of a tree (Fig. 18a); b) seated deity and a seated priest (Fig. ISb); c) standing deity with horned headdress and bangles in both arms (Fig. 18c). Thus the use of signs to tell a story in the inscription on the fourth side appears as simply an alternative to that using images. If the sign [31] is a representation of a seated priest/worshipper as the iconographical parallelism suggests, then its implications for the understanding of the Indus script are important. There are a large number of Indus inscriptions which have this sign [32] occurring in front of the different graphic variations of the 'man' sign [33]. The latter set of signs I have proposed to represent divinities earlier in this paper. Hence, this frequently occurring sign combinations [34] are ideographically explicit in themselves as 'the priest/worshipper seated in front of god/gods and is engaged in ritual or worship'. Some of the selected inscriptions which include this pairing are presented below (Fig. 20). **** imza i3o/ ?l/Olm *i&gt;tV* 33?7 OVXaU? **** Uli Fig. 20 - Inscriptions with sign for seated priest/worshipper in front of divinities. (Prepared from Mahadevan 1977: 195-204). An issue in the inscriptions of Fig. 20 is that the sequence of two or three signs [35] are often embedded within a series of additional signs. In the sequence of three signs [36] the last one (buffalo head) is placed after the 'horned man' sign representing divinity. It seems that these two signs carry the same meaning, i.e. god, and are complementary. Some of the additional signs [37] in these inscriptions appear to be symbols for sacred trees (see pp. 23-26). It is possible that the signs [15] 45</page><page sequence="16">[38] also represent sacred trees considering their pictographic resemblance to trees with a railing [39], a tree itself [40] and encircled tree symbols [41] respectively. The sign [42] may be a pictographic representation of gods' shrine and has a resemblance to the lower part of the gods' 'reed house or shrine' (discussed below pp. 19-20) in Fig. 25 a. Although some other signs [43] in these inscriptions cannot be presently identified, I think the central narrative theme of each inscription is clear through the main sequence of two/three signs embedded in them. The narrative theme appears to be the 'worship of god by the priest or worshipper seated in front'. The additional tree signs and possibly the sign for god's shrine in some of these inscriptions reveal that the worship of gods was performed in association with sacred trees and god's shrine. In seal nos. 1010 [44] and 2596 [45] the seated priest or devotee is represented before the sacred tree signs [46] and the intended narrative may be the 'worship of the sacred tree'. Or according to no. 1010 'worship of the god of the sacred tree' as the tree sign is followed by the 'horned-man sign' representing god. On one side of seal no. 1475, the short inscription [47] has only two signs. Of these two signs the one on the left [48] is the 'composite man' which represents divinity. The other [49] is the seated priest/worshipper in front of the divinity [50]. On the other side of this seal that seems to be two pots occurs followed by a diamond shaped sign and two short strokes [51]. Again, the theme of this seal inscription may be a ritual or worship of a divinity by a priest/devotee. The depiction of the 'pot' sign twice suggests that the offering of pots was part of these rituals. Although the diamond-shaped sign cannot be identified, it is possible that it also represents sacredness, given the context of the inscription. It may be recalled in this respect that the first few tablets (M-481 A, Fig. 2; M-478 A, M-479 A, M-480 A, Fig. 4; M-453 B, M-454 B, Fig. 5) discussed early in this paper contained clear representations of vessel offerings to sacred trees, seated gods and standing Indus man-signs. Inscription no. 4047 [52] provides us further an interesting context. Here a seated priest/devotee [53] occurs in front of a 'horned man' [54] sign. Preceding the seated priest/devotee occurs what seems to be a standardized representation of a tree [55] preceded by nine short strokes [56]. In tablets M-478 A, 479 A and 480 A (Fig. 4) we have already witnessed iconographic representations of offering of vessels by devotees to sacred trees. Also as part of the inscription on these tablets [57] are four strokes followed by a 'pot' sign [58], which Parpola suggested to be an idea for offering of four pots. Identifying the other two signs [59] at the end in these inscriptions, i.e. the bracketed man' sign as divinity and the 'comb' sign [60] as sacred tree, I propose an ideographic reading for the complete inscription as: four vessel offerings to the divinity of the sacred tree. The same logic can be applied to inscription no. 4047 [61]. The difference between this inscription and that just discussed is that the nine short strokes are not associated with or followed by a 'pot' sign. Although the sign for 'pot' is absent, the 46 [16]</page><page sequence="17">fact that these strokes [62] are immediately followed by a sign for a sacred tree [63] provides a context to suggest that the short strokes indicate nine pots offered to the sacred tree. The 'horned man-sign' in front of which the seated priest or worshipper occurs in the middle of the inscription may indicate the tree divinity itself. Therefore in no. 4047, the inscription [64] represents the idea of: nine pot/vessel offerings to the divinity of the sacred tree. Taken such ritual offering context into consideration the last sign 'buffalo head/headdress' [65] occurring next to the 'horned man-sign' in no. 4047 may also be understood as a highly ideographic sign denoting god, which was used to strengthen the sacred nature of the inscription. Fig. 21 - a. Tablet from Mohenjodaro, M-494 A, depicting three pots followed by sign for sacred tree [171]. (After Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 121). b. Drawing of the inscription on M-494 A. A tablet from Mohenjodaro M-494 A (Fig. 2\d) appears to present a similar statement of offerings to the sacred tree or tree divinity, but with a different method of counting the offerings. Rather than strokes used for numbers of pots or offerings, the pots themselves are repeated, with three separate 'jar' signs indicated. The nine signs begin with two that I cannot identify, but the next seven show the priest or worshipper before the divinity, here indicated by the bull/buffalo head and the man sign with yoke, followed by the three offerings given to the sacred tree, indicated by the final sign. It is interesting to note that the man-sign and head, here separated, can easily be imagined as placed together, giving us the sign [66] discussed above on seal M-1405 A (Fig. 10). The two signs clearly could be placed side-by-side or connected into a single man-sign. That there were two different methods of indicating the number of offerings used on the tablets is supported by more than forty miniature tablets from Harappa (Mahadevan 1977: 197-200). They have a short identical inscription [67] on one side and invariably on the other side are depicted two, three or four strokes followed by a pot [68]. This again suggests the close association the strokes had with the pots in Indus inscriptions. Two identical miniature tablets from Harappa (H-764 A, 765 A) on one side each has three pots that have been indicated without strokes (Fig. 22). This rare occurrence strengthens the argument that strokes and pots are complementary signs and in the majority of inscriptions strokes replaced the number of pots. [17] 47</page><page sequence="18">lim ibid 11-764 A H-764 B Fig. 22 - Two miniature tablets from Harappa, H-764 A, H-765 A, depicting three pots on the reverse. (After Shah &amp; Parpola 1991: 323). With little space available in the miniature tablets from Harappa, strokes as numerical indicators would have been a convenient and an economical way to indicate pots. Yet another method of indicating pot offerings and their number is seen on two tablets from Harappa (H-247 A and H-815 B; Fig. 23). On these tablets two seated figures reach out to touch a jar-sign which is followed by two strokes (the seated figure on tablet H-815 B has hitherto not been noted in the literature while the figure on H-247 A has been). The seated worshipper is facing to the right, and reaches out to touch a jar-sign that is the same size as the offerer. The jar-sign is followed by two strokes. Thus, the meaning appears to be 'two jars offered,' although to what deity we do not know (unless the deity is indicated in some way with the signs on the reverse, which, however, vary on the two tablets). On H-247 A H-765 A H-76.5 B H-247 A H-247 B Fig. 23 - A seated worshipper holding a pot on the reverse of two miniature tablets from Harappa, H-247 A and H-815 B. a. H-247 A.

I-8I5 A the seated man is depicted with a long pig tail and on the other, H-815 B, he is depicted without pig tail. The pig tail may be a stylistic convention indicating a woman, a priest, or some other category of worshipper. Two, three and four strokes accompanying the pots may be numerical indicators for the number of pots offered. There would have been more than four pot offerings in some occasions. But 2-4 strokes seem to be the convention to indicate many pots. That these pot offerings were an actual part of the Indus rituals from the early times of the civilization is evident by the seated devotees holding pots in the two miniature tablets H-247 A and H-815 B. (Six other iconographically clear examples of pot offerings on tablets [18]</page><page sequence="19">were already discussed earlier; M-478 A, 479 A, 480 A identical tablets, Fig. 4; M 481 A, Fig. 2; M-453 B, M-454 B identical tablets, Fig. 5). I have suggested a correlation between the pot signs and strokes used as numerical indicators for the number of pots being given. That pots were offered is clearly shown by the many tablets that represent seated worshippers holding out pots to deities, and also by the man-signs (which I identify as deities) which then hold the received pots. There are tablets, however, that show the man-sign actually touching the strokes and without pots. It seems likely that this is a shortened way of indicating the deity receiving the number of pots indicated by the strokes but without the pot-sign shown. There are examples on which only the strokes are made amounting to four ([69]: M-262 A, Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 65); [70]: M-383 A, ibid:. 95), seven ([71]: H-160 C, ibid:. 203) and twelve ([72]: recently found Mc Mohan cylinder in the British Museum believed to be from Swat or Seistan region; Knox 1994: 376). Based on the identification of 'man' signs as representing divinities, and the possible correlation between the numerical strokes and pots, the strokes held by the 'man' signs can be interpreted as the number of pots offered to divinity. In other words, the number ot pots received by the divinity. And the god/goddess is represented holding them by hand in these examples. One seal inscription (M-721 A) from Mohenjodaro (Fig. 24), although frag? mentary, clearly shows two pots next to each other with 'man' sign holding one of them. Ideographically it indicates pots being held by divinity. The inscription on M-721 A [73] can be directly correlated to the examples of the man-sign holding numerical strokes [74]. Fig. 24 - Divinity denoted by the 'man' sign holding pots, on a fragmentary seal from Mohenjodaro, M-721 A. (After Shah &amp;Parpola 1991:47). The Sacred Shrine Kenoyer (1998: 113) made an important observation that on two tablets a figure or deity sits beside a 'reed house or shrine' (Fig. 25). The figure is most likely a deity, as it sits in the 'y?gic' pose, rather than the seated pose of the worshipper or priest. The building appears to be made of thatch or woven reed mats, and probably is intended to represent the shrine in which the 'y?gic' deity resided. Again these narrative images have a correlative sign [75] indicating a shrine. Usually occurring with the shrine-sign is the worshipper-sign and the bull/buffalo [19] 49</page><page sequence="20">:44.

The narrative reading is the devotee or priest worships at (or in) the shrine of the deity (Fig. 26). The similarity of the sign [761 to the reed house [771 may suggest that the sign [781 may be a standardized representation of the reed house or shrine. If such an identification is correct the preceding sign [791 in all these inscriptions, i.e. a seated priest or a worshipper in front of the deity's reed house or shrine engaged in ritual [801, makes consistent sense. Such a sign combination [811 highlights the ritualistic and narrative nature of these inscriptions. Inscription nos. 5293, 4419, 4451 and 4372 (Fig. 27) are all miniature tablets from Harappa and have the pot sign with two or four associated strokes on the reverse. On the obverse the inscriptions contain the reed house and seated priest signs as part of the inscriptions. Further, in no. 4372, there occurs a depiction of a seated man with pig tail offering a pot on the reverse of the tablet. In nos. 4419 and 4451 the inscription ends with the 'comb' sign [82], which I proposed to be a standardized representation of a sacred tree earlier in this paper (Fig. 4). In no. 4372 the 'comb' sign/tree sign [831 is repeated twice, which might denote two sacred trees. Or it may be the reduplication of the 'comb' sign/tree sign 50 [201</page><page sequence="21">to emphasize the sacredness of the tree. All these signs, i.e. reed house or shrine [84], seated priest in front of shrine [85], sign for sacred tree at the end of inscriptions [86], pots with strokes denoting the number of pot offerings on the reverse of these tablets [87], and the depiction of a seated worshipper offering a pot ([88]: no. 4372) suggest a ritualistic nature to these miniature tablets. And the meaning of the inscriptions may be ideographic suggestive of a narrative nature which could be understood as: offering by the priest/worshipper to the deity in the shrine with the sacred tree: 2 pots (4 pots etc.). The 'bull/buffalo head' [89] occurring after the reed house/shrine sign [90] may be a highlighter of the sacredness of the divinity.

(After Mahadevan 1977: 450-52). inscriptions on obverse and strokes followed by the 'pot sign occur on the reverse of these miniature tablets. There are more than 40 miniature tablets from Harappa which have the same short inscription with three signs occur (Fig. 28 illustrates these examples): Fig. 28 - Three categories of a large number of miniature tablets from Harappa with an identical short inscription on the obverse. Reverse: Two, three or four vertical strokes followed by the pot sign. (After Mahadevan 1977: 197-200). The first of these signs is the standardized representation of a seated priest or worshipper [92]; second is the 'bull/buffalo head' [93]; and third is the standardized representation of the sacred tree [94]. On the reverse of these tablets a pot is depicted invariably in association with either two, three or four vertical strokes [95]. The narrative reading is: Ritual performance or offering to the deity of the sacred tree: 2 pots (3 pots, 4 pots etc.). [21] 51</page><page sequence="22">The Seated Priest/Devotee in Front of a Tree or a Tree Shrine Kenoyer (1997: 155) has published recently found tablets from Harappa which contain an identical inscription [96] (Fig. 29a). A close parallel to this inscription can be found on a seal (L-95 A) from Lothal [97] (Fig. 29b). In the Lothal inscription the first sign [98] is graphically different from the first sign of the Harappa inscription [99]. In the same way, the second sign from the left in the Lothal inscription [100] is graphically different from the sign in the same position in the Harappa inscription [101]. It is possible that the signs rendered with slightly different graphic variations representing the same ideographic meaning. The first sign with graphic variations in these inscriptions is the diamond shaped one [102] and occurs separated by two short strokes from the rest of the inscription. The second half of these inscriptions starts with the seated priest/devotee sign [103], which is placed before the sign which represents a two branched tree [104]. Fig. 29 - a. Three tablets recently found at Harappa. Obverse: Inscription containing seated priest/worshipper [173] in front of the sacred tree abode [174] of god/gods. Reverse: Sacred tree and the cult object on unicorn seals. (After Kenoyer 1997: 155). h. A closely similar inscription on a Lothal seal, L-95 A. (After Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 260). These two branched tree signs with their U-shaped are stylistically reminiscent of the two branched pipal tree found on the famous 'fig deity' seal, M-1186 A (Fig. 30) from Mohenjodaro, which also occurs on two other seals, M-442 A, M-488 C (Fig. 30). The pipal trees on these seals are depicted with a horned deity emerging from them. Therefore it is possible that the Indus signs on Harappa tablets [105] reminiscent of the pipal tree, though not depicted with a deity emerging from it, ideographically represents the tree shrine [106] of a deity/deities similar to the one shown on the Tig deity' seals (Fig. 30). Thus, the two signs of the worshipper and tree on the tablets from Harappa and Lothal (Fig. 29a and b), like the images on the narrative tablets (Fig. 30a-c)y can be interpreted similarly, as the worship or the performance of ritual to the tree deity or tree shrine by the seated priest/devotee. 52 [22]</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 30 - 'Fig deity' seals depicting similar narrative, a. M-1186 A, from Mohenjodaro. (After Shah &amp; Parpola 1991: 139). b. M-442 A, from Mohenjodaro. (After Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 109). c. M-488 C from Mohenjodaro. (After Joshi &amp; Parpola 1987: 119). The number of graphic variations of tree signs on the seals and tablets is great. In some instances, they are standardized representations of individual sacred trees [107] (Fig. 31). In other instances, these sacred trees are rendered as a combination of two or three graphically varying tree signs [108] (Fig. 32). It is possible that all these signs ideographically representing tree abodes or shrines of Indus tree divinities. There are many tree signs with graphic variations, such as the man-sign already discussed. If they can be interpreted as ideographs for sacred trees, then the basic signary of the Indus script would result in a drastic reduction than the generally considered range of 400+ signs. Signs Accommodated within the Sacred Tree Signs As already mentioned, a large number of tree signs can be found as single basic signs as well as composite tree signs to the single basic tree signs suggests that they all belong to one specific category representing sacred trees or tree abodes of gods. This large number of tree/tree-abode signs in the Indus script itself is a subject which deserves a separate in-depth study.

It is interesting to note that in this group of composite signs they accommodate another Indus sign within the tree signs [109]. These accommodated signs may well be the emblems or symbols for divinities. The idea may be that the divinity symbolized by such signs [110] are present/immanent in their tree abodes. As such the sign [111] is possible to be identified as a symbol for god. It is the beginning sign of many Indus inscriptions (Mahadevan 1977: 690-95). The sign is often separated by two short strokes from the rest of the text. In one seal (M-712 A) (Shah &amp; Parpola 1991: 45) it is found [112] engraved on the neck of the unicorn (Fig. 34a) which may point to its ideographic meaning as implying the sacredness of the animal. In a recently found tablet from Harappa (Kenoyer 1998: 114) (Fig. 34b), this sign appears alone above the head of the female deity who is holding two tigers with [25] 55</page><page sequence="26">her extended hands, which, as on the previous example, may indicate her sacredness. It may be pertinent to point out that the star sign, often found in the beginning of the Sumerian inscriptions, read as 'Dingir' denoting god. The other sign [113], which often occurs inside these tree signs (Fig. 35), is noted by Parpola as: Allographs of the Indus sign representing a three branched 'fig tree' and of its ligature with the 'crab' sign, where the middlemost branch has been omitted to accommodate the inserted 'crab' sign. (Parpola 1994a: 235). C*-1 C-?0 ?-?4 M-?t* N-m ?- 1ft fl-lft *-m L-U Itfir *%M4 ?-7o* A-iOO ?lf*J Fig. 35 - The so-called 'crab' sign accommodated within the Tig tree'. (After Parpola 1994a: 235, fig. 13.15). Glyptics on an ancient near eastern cylinder seal (Fig. 36) belonging to the old Babylonian period (c. 1900 B.C.) help to get a clue regarding the identification and the ideographic meaning of this 'crab' sign [114]. The old Babylonian seal (Fig. 36) chronologically coincides with the later Indus Period (c. 1900 B.C.). A sign [115] on this seal is similar to the Indus crab-sign [116]. This sign [117] is shown just above the bull's head which is depicted in the sky on the upper right of the seal (on the left of the head of the 'bow' carrying man) (Porada 1948, I: pi. LXI, no. 427 E). It may depict a 'heavenly bull' with divine power, the 'heavenly bull' being an epithet used to address Mesopotamian gods (especially the main god Enlil) in a number of Sumerian and Akkadian literary texts, some of which are contemporary to the Indus Valley period. In the seal just above the bull's head, sign [118] occurs which appears to have a close association to the bull (represented by the depicted bull's head). However, the publication where this seal is discussed does not mention or note about this symbol. In fact, this sign [119] above the bull's head in the seal, has a close resemblance to two Indus signs [120]. The latter of the two [121] has been named by Parpola as the 'crab' sign. Whether these two Indus signs are distinctly different or similar in their ideographic meaning is a matter yet unresolved. If the sign on the old Babylonian seal is an ideograph for bull, it is not impossible that the closely resembling Indus signs [122] carry the same ideographic sense. Therefore, accommodating the crab-sign [123], within the fig tree ((Parpola 1994a: 235, fig. 13.1J) or within the sacred tree abode sign/signs [124], may be an ideographic expression of the divinity immanent in the tree abode who has a prominent bull or buffalo identity. It may be recalled that in the famous 56 [26]</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 36 - Old Babylonian seal (c. 1900 B.C.) with sign [177] above bull's head. (After Paroda 1948, I: pi. LXI, no. 427 E). 'pipal deity' seal M-1186 A (Fig. 30a), the deity emerging in the middle of the two branched pipal tree wears a horned headdress expressing possibly a bull/buffalo identity. The same characteristic horns can be seen in the emerging deity from the pipal tree of the same narrative depicted on tablet M-488 C (Fig. 19a). Identified in such manner, the 'crab' sign accommodated in the Tig tree'/'pipal tree' [125] becomes a standardized ideographic rendering, correlating to the iconographically elaborate horned deity emerging from the pipal tree on Indus seals and tablets (Fig. 37). Given such correlation, it is possible that the accommodated sign [126] (Fig. 35) within the sacred tree is an ideographic symbol for the Tig deity' itself. [27] 57</page><page sequence="28">Problems in Identifying the Bull's Head as a Grammatical Suffix The sign I have identified as the 'bull/buffalo head' [127] occurs in many inscriptions, where it most frequently is placed as the terminal sign. Thus, scholars have tended to identify it phonetically as a grammatical suffix (Parpola 1994a: 60, 95 f., 277). My iconic reading of the sign, however, argues against the sign being a phonetic marker (or, at least, of it being exclusively so). The sign's non-phonetic function is supported by its occurrence alone in a number of contexts. The non phonetic function of the sign is likely as well when it occurs as the 'head' on the man-sign discussed above, where I suggest it indicates a deity. Another instance of the sign indicating a deity is an interesting example that occurs on seal M-639a. This complex sign combines three separate component signs [128]: the bull/buffalo head sign has the cross-lines in a circle sign inside, which itself is topped by a tree sign. The circle sign is an indicator of a deity placed on the bull/buffalo head sign, itself a sign of a deity. The tree extends from the center of the two, as between the horns of many iconic images of a tree form between buffalo horns. The following (Fig. 38) occurrences of this sign [129] as part of a composite sign [130] would also strengthen the view that it may be an ideographic sign: Fig. 38 - Sign [178] as a part of composite signs. (Prepared from Parpola 1994a: 71-78, fig. 5.2). Correlation of Horned Pish [131] Sign and Horned Man [132] Sign Two principles for interpreting the Indus signary are suggested by the above discussion. 1. that signs with graphic variations may represent a common concept or similar ideographic expression. For example, the man-sign may, with all of its graphic variations, indicate a divinity or divinities; the tree-signs both basic and composite with their graphic variations indicate sacred trees or tree abodes of gods, and short strokes denoting different numerals as numbers of pot offerings etc. 2. that if additional signs attached to two different signs are similar, the additional signs may indicate that the two different signs share a common concept or activity. These two features of the Indus script and signary may be helpful in understanding other Indus signs as well. However, the whole script may not have been governed by such blanket features; hence, there can be exceptions. The second principle can be used in analyzing the addition of similar signs (short diagonal strokes) to two different signs, the man- and fish-signs. That these strokes 2*42. C-13 58 [28]</page><page sequence="29">attached to the man-sign are intended to be horns is apparent when examining the different occurrences of the actual sign in inscriptions (C-17, L-220) [133]. The possibility of this 'horned man' sign representing a divinity was also discussed early in this paper (Fig. 2). The two short strokes are diagonally attached to the upper part of the 'fish' sign on either side [134] in a similar way to those in the horned-man. It is possible that they are also meant for horns and indicate divine nature of the 'fish' sign ideographically. Further, the body of the already discussed 'composite man' sign (identified as a divinity) on the terracotta tablet from Kalibangan (K-79 A) is depicted fish-shaped although without the fins (Fig. 16). If a fish was meant in depicting the body of this divinity, the ideography of a fish-sign as a representative of divinity becomes evident. Further, iconographic evidence from Indus seals and tablets points to a special association of the 'fish' sign with seated Indus deities on throne (Mahadevan 1977: pi. vi; Parpola 1994a: fig. 10.11). An 'anthropomorph' of the Ganjetic Copper Hoards from Sheorajpur (Kanpur District, U.P., India), has a 'fish' sign incised on it (Parpola 1994a: fig. 4.2). These copper hoards are dated to the early second millennium B.C., a time period not far removed from the mature Indus period. A number of miniature tablets from the early levels of Harappa have only the 'fish' sign on one side of them, whereas the other side has a short inscription (H-364 C, H-366 C etc.). This suggests that the 'fish' sign had a special place in the Indus script during its earlier stages as well. Six Indus tablets have a depiction of a crocodile carrying the 'fish' sign in its mouth. Four of these are from Mohenjodaro (M-410 A, M-482 B, M-489 A, M-1429 C), one from Harappa (H-172 B) and one from Kalibangan (K-78 B). Although this depiction is sometimes called 'the fish eating alligator' in Indus literature, there seems to have been a deeper religious meaning. The concept may be that the divinity symbolized by the 'fish' sign is carried safely through the waters by its sacred animal, the crocodile. Such a depiction associating the crocodile with 'fish' sign is special and have not been found regarding other signs. Considering such an iconographical evidence it is not impossible that the 'fish' sign denotes a divinity and its depiction with horns becomes understandable. The fish-sign occurs in inscriptions in multiples of graphic variations. In such cases, the graphic variations of 'fish' sign [135] found in the script may represent different attributes of the same god/goddess. Occurrence of as much as three variations of this sign next to each other in inscriptions (Mahadevan 1977: text nos. 3074, 1400, 7220, 2193, 2271, 1235) [136] - where no other sign generally reveals such higher combinations - points to the Indus scribes having treated the sign in a special way. However, lack of any pattern or regularity in these fish sign combinations [137] reveals that the scribes would have used their discretion and were not strictly following a convention. In such case, the possibilities are that there are no grammatical rules behind these sign combinations and may be that the signs are purely ideographic representing different attributes of an Indus god or a goddess. [29] 59</page><page sequence="30">Conclusion The iconic nature of Indus signs were discussed in this paper. In some cases these signs and their sequences have close parallels to Indus iconographic depictions. One of the best examples (Fig. 19) for this is provided by the similarity of signs and sign sequence on moulded faience tablets at Harappa as compared to the famous ritualistic/religious narrative scene on the tablet from Mohenjodaro (M-488 C). Although there are no bilingual inscriptions, we may say that bi-iconographical evidence is now found in the strongly correlating tablets aforementioned. Such a correlation also strengthens the validity of the 'man' sign [138] as divinity, sign [139] as a seated priest/worshipper and sign [140] as a sacred/sacrificial animal associated with the ritual itself or the ritual/religious narrative. Other iconographic correlations were discussed in examples such as in Fig. 2, M-481 A: a seated devotee offering a vessel to Indus 'horned man' sign [141] depicting a divinity; Fig. 4, M-478 A, M-479 A, M-480 A: correlation of the scene of seated devotee offering a vessel/pot to a sacred tree to the Indus 'man' sign [142] denoting a divinity on the same tablets; Fig. 10, M-1405 A: correlation of bull feeding from a trough to the Indus 'composite man' sign [143]; Fig. 11: correlation of the mythological figure on M-588 B to Indus 'bowman' sign [144]; Fig. 13: correlation of a man holding a club on an ivory plaque M-1653 A and the Indus sign [145]; Fig. 25: correlation of actual reed house/shrine of god on recently found tablets from Harappa to the Indus sign [146]; Fig. 16: interchangeability of human and bull/buffalo head in K-79 A and the correlation of the fish-shaped body of this composite sign to the fish-sign [147] of Indus script etc. On the other hand iconographical clues found in signs themselves point to the ideographic or rather iconic nature of the Indus signs and the ideas intended by them. Divinities holding trees [148]; divinities holding vessels/pots [149]; seated priests/worshippers in front of gods [150]; graphic variants of sacred trees [151]; graphic variants of trees as gods' abodes [152]; seated devotees offering vessels/pots to gods: Fig. 2, M-481 A; seated devotees holding vessels/pots in worship: Fig. 23, H-247 A, H-815 B; depiction of rows of pots: Fig. 22, H-764 B and H-765 B [153], M-494 A [154]; god holding raw of pots: Fig. 24, M-721 A [155]; gods holding rows of strokes implying pots: M-262 A, M-383 A, H-160 C and Mc Mohan seal [156]; association of pots with strokes [157]; depiction of iconographically explicit horned deities in inscriptions: Fig. 9, M-452 A, M-1400 A; correlation of the horns of the Indus 'horned man' sign [158] and the 'horned fish' sign [159] and some other clues discussed in this paper provide iconographic insights to identification of the Indus signs and their iconic/ideographic nature. The validity of these identifications, I believe, can be tested by other scholars independently using the same iconographic clues. Considering all such evidences a natural and an overall observation one can make is that this script possesses a strong iconic aspect and the signs behave as 60 [30]</page><page sequence="31">standardized imagery. If so, it is possible that the script would not yield a language or a phonetic decipherment. Hence the decipherment itself will be the accurate understanding of the iconography of signs as standardized imagery and the Indus inscriptions as religious/ritualistic narratives emerging from the sequences of such an imagery. Towards this goal I have attempted to understand some of the most frequently occurring signs and sign groups. I have applied this iconic understanding to a large number of Indus inscriptions which make sense as sequences of standardized Indus imagery containing narratives of religious and ritualistic nature. The main identifications in this paper are: 1. 'Man' signs [160] as divinities. 2. Tree' signs [161] as sacred trees. 3. Sign [162] as standardized depiction of bull/buffalo head. 4. Sign [163] as seated priest or worshipper. 5. Sign [164] as reed house/shrine of Indus gods. 6. Short strokes denoting different numbers as pots/vessels offered to Indus gods and sacred trees. 7. 'Fish' sign [165] as denoting a horned deity. Graphic variations of 'fish' sign [166] denoting different aspects of the same deity. 8. Composite tree signs [167] as divinity immanent in his/her sacred tree abode. 9. Signs [168] as symbols of sacredness. 'Man' signs as divinities, 'tree' signs as abodes of gods/goddesses, quite apparent 'pot' offerings to these sacred trees, long and short vertical strokes as number of the 'pot' offerings to trees/gods, and seated priests/devotees worshipping or performing the rituals to Indus gods are some of the main features and messages in Indus inscriptions. These signs seem to be ideographic and the message of the inscriptions narrative, conveying ritualistic/sacred meaning. If the context, nature and purpose of the Indus seals and inscriptions can be established in this manner, such an understanding is helpful to establish the meaning of yet unidentified signs, as we now have a better idea to research in the correct direction.
