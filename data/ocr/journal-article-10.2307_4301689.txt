Phinney Fund, 2005.115.221 This is one of 352 coins from the Margarete Bieber Collection acquired this year to strengthen our Roman portrait holdings. In her unpublished catalogue, acquired with the coins, the German-born archaeologist, who taught at Columbia for many years, described this coin as a strong portrait of an energetic woman with an intelligent expression, who ruled when her son, Alexander Severus, '/ was still young. Julia Mamaea is beautifully depicted, draped and with her hair parted and laid in horizontal waves. The reverse FELICITAS PVBLICA wishes happiness to the people of Rome. Rooster Pendant Greek, Thessalian, 8th century BC Bronze, cast by the lost-wax process; h. 6.6 cm Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Gift of Sol Rabin in honor of David Mitten, 2006.12 Ancient Greek artists of the aptly named Geometric period (900-700 BC) decorated pottery with dazzling geometric designs, including human and animal figures reduced to a few characteristic forms in silhou- ette. Similar tendencies occurred in works of bronze. Impressive in profile, the comb, tail, and legs of this graceful rooster all but , disappear in the front view. Birds were integral elements of the t Geometric cosmos; their images were figured on pottery and deposited in sanctuaries as bronze pendants. I.,.

Straus in honor of David Mitten, 2005.116 The Greek orator and statesman Demosthenes (384-322 BC) is por- trayed slightly hunched, with furrowed forehead, contracted brows, and clenched hands, as if weighing his thoughts in preparation for one of his Philippics, speeches against Philip 11 of Macedon that warned the Athenians of the danger of a Macedonian domination of Greece. This Roman copy of the lost honorific statue of the orator- a work by the sculptor Polyeuktos that stood in the Athenian Agora- is the most complete replica known and preserves features such as the hands, which are lost in larger marble statues.</page><page sequence="3">I I .I i i I I I i I I.

Sackler Museum, Purchase through the generosity of the Ralph C. Marcove International Understanding Through Arts and Crafts Foundation, 2005.110 jingdezhen blue-and-white porcelain produced during the Yongle (1403-1424) and Xuande (1426-1435) reigns is considered the finest because of its radiant glaze, magnificent cobalt hue, and exquisitely painted decoration. Although much early-15th-century porcelain was created for the Chinese imperial court, another sizeable portion was made for export to the Near and Middle East. This vessel's decorative floral motif is purely Chinese, and its perfect color and virtuoso painting elevate the piece to the rank of masterpiece. 0 n .0 : CB I _. co in</page><page sequence="4">.4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4 AK:.~~~~~~~~QI</page><page sequence="5">Yi Ha-Ong (also known as Tae-w6n-kun and Sok-p'a) Korean, 1820-1898 Orchids and Rocks, datable to 1896-98 Set of four hanging scrolls; ink on silk; with signature reading P'al-ship no-s6k-in chak; with one large seal of the artist on each scroll and with two additional seals of the artist following the signature; each painting proper, 87.5 x 30.8 cm Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Purchase in honor of John M. Rosenfield through the generosity of Mariot Fraser Solomon, 2005.99.1-4 A prince and the father of Korea's last king, Yi Ha-Ong was an accomplished painter unsurpassed in his mastery of ink orchids. Typically depicted alongside rocks, the orchid appears graceful, refined, and unaffected by its rough surroundings, the perfect metaphor for the East Asian scholar. Yi delighted in the contrast between the rough brushwork used for the rocks and the fine, calligraphic brushwork employed for the leaves and blossoms, just as he also enjoyed the contrast between the areas of pale and of heavy, black ink. Yi signed this work with the sobriquet P'al-ship no-s6k-in chak which translates "Eighty-year-old rock man." Li Junyl (Chun-yi Lee) Chinese, b. 1965 What a Glorious Land!, 2005 Handscroll; ink on paper; with signature reading LiJunyi '05; 17 x 300 cm Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Purchase in honor of Professor Chu-tsing Li through the generosity of an anonymous donor and of the Ralph C. Marcove International Understanding Through Arts and Crafts Foundation, 2006.13 Ink rubbings from stelae carved during the Eastern Han period (AD 25-220) are the artistic inspira- tion for Li Junyi's current work. After penciling a grid on the paper ground, the artist uses a small piece of cork to stamp ink within the squares to compose his painting. In rejecting the brush in favor of a cork stamp for applying ink to paper and in seeking artistic inspiration in ancient stelae and modern poetry, Li makes a significant break with traditional Chinese painting and espouses the new.

This painting is unsigned but is almost certainly the work of Mu'in Musawir, one of the 17th century's most prolific Persian artists and the last important practitioner of the classical style. Although conservative in style, Mu'in's painting tackled innovative subject matter: illustrated histories of the Safavid dynasty came into vogue only at the end of the dynasty.</page><page sequence="8">U FOGG ART MUSEUM Painting, Sculpture, and Decorative Arts Charles Th6odore Frere French, 1814-1888 Arab Encampment at Sunset, mid-lgth century Oil on panel; 20.6 x 32.7 cm Fogg Art Museum, Gift of Paul William Garber and Philip C. Garber, Class of 1956, 2006.50 This painting of an Arab encampment silhouetted against a sunset is typical of the modest-sized panels produced by Charles Theodore Frere who, trained in Paris, fell under the spell of the "Orient" during an initial stay in Algeria in 1837. The evocative rendering of the campfire and a sky rich with dusky glow demonstrate Frere's skill and interest in capturing the atmospheric effects of the desert landscape. Such romanticized depictions of nomadic life appealed greatly to European audiences of the day.</page><page sequence="9">- 0. -1 :1 'N - t. -, ?1 Moderno (Gateazzo Mondella) Italian, 1467-1528 Hercules Wrestling with a Centaur, c. 1490 Relief: mercury gilt bronze, 7 x 5.5 x 0.4 cm Fogg Art Museum, Bequest of Richard B. Sisson and through the generosity of Anthony and Celeste Meier, 2005.163 Moderno is generally accepted as the most important artist of Italian Renaissance plaquettes. This finely worked and gilded relief is from a celebrated series depicting the Labors of Hercules and shows the artist's increasing interest in classical architecture: the arena was most likely modeled after the one in the artist's native Verona. In this strug- gle, Hercules, the embodiment of Fortitude, takes on Cacus, a monstrous emblem of Vice, who has disguised himself as a lion-bodied centaur. This is the first of Moderno's classical subjects to enter the Fogg's collection. American Painting, Sculpture, and Decorative Arts Frederic Edwin Church American, 1826-1900 View of Wimmis, Valley of the Simmental, Switzerland, i868 Oil on paper, mounted on canvas, 32.5 x 50.5 cm Fogg Art Museum, Anonymous gift, 2005.109 This oil sketch is a rare example of Frederic Edwin Church's plein-air style. The sketch was executed in a single session in August i868 as the painter was concluding his grand tour of the Near East and Europe. View of Wimmis presents Church, possibly the most admired of American landscape painters, as a brilliant observer of form and light. This work aug- ments our small but growing collection of oil sketches by leading members of the Hudson River school. U c .0 c 0 I _. _.

As a result of this gift, an intern in painting conservation at the Art Museums was able to conduct intensive research on Gifford's technique, studying this painting with ii sketchbooks given earlier by this donor and our well- known Leander's Tower on the Bosphorus.</page><page sequence="11">s ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ oy'qf -ll S~MINAW U .0 cn 0 :3 I _~. _.

Pollack, Class of 1960, American Art Acquisition Fund, 2006.4 A superb example of the neoclassical style, Still Life with Watermelon was exhibited by Sarah Miriam Peale at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1822. She trained with her cousin Raphaelle Peale, considered the founder of the still-life tradition in the United States, and went on to become one of the nation's first successful women painters. This work becomes one of the Fogg's two most important antebellum still lifes, along with Charles Bird King's Vanity of the Artist's Dream.</page><page sequence="12">U Modern and Contemporary Art Henri Matisse French, 1869-1954 Madeleine 1, 1901 Bronze, h. 59.4 cm Fogg Art Museum, Bequest of Frances Leventritt in honor and in memory of M. Victor Leventritt, Harvard Class of 1935, 2005.174 In recent years Matisse has been recognized as one of the great sculptors of the 20th cen- tury. This famous bronze, one of his earliest, is a landmark in his development. Its radical contrapposto and violent arabesque led him to a lifelong exploration of the expressive pos- sibilities of the female nude. The sculpture makes a fascinating comparison with Le Serf, its male counterpart, also in the collection of the Fogg, and will be invaluable for study as well as exhibition.</page><page sequence="13">U n 0 I _~. _~. in Georgia O'Keeffe American, 1887-1986 Red and Pink, 1925 Oil on canvas, 46.6 x 31.8 cm Fogg Art Museum, Gift of Dr. Ernest G. Stillman, Class of 19o7, by exchange, 2006.49 The first painting by Georgia O'Keeffe to enter the collection, this is a historic acquisition. By 1925 when she painted this canvas, O'Keeffe had been experimenting with abstraction for several years. With its powerful arrangement of organic forms, this painting is a classic example of her oeuvre, although its all-over patterning is unusual and may reflect the fact that a silk fabric company commissioned the work. Its pristine condition will allow careful study and appreciation of the artist's technique.</page><page sequence="14">U Paul Feeley American, 1910-1966 UntItded, 1958 Oil-based enamel on canvas, 165.1 X 236.2 x 5.1 cm Fogg Art Museum, Gift of the family of Paul Feeley, 2006.46 Despite his early death in 1966, Paul Feeley took the color-field painting of Morris Louis and Barnett Newman in a new direction, evolving what one critic recently called an "idiosyncratic vocabulary of loopy shapes, like abstracted butterflies, bowling pins, and light bulbs." In this painting, daring in its use of the three primary colors, that vocabulary is just emerging. The theme of emergence itself is suggested by the way the forms bleed and mingle at their edges.</page><page sequence="15">U c: .0 co _~. co wii; Larry Zox American, b. 1936 Glass PoInt, 1967-68 Acrylic on canvas, 203.2 X 162.6 cm Fogg Art Museum, Purchase through the generosity of Rita E. and Gustave M. Hauser, 2006.73 Larry Zox was an important if rather overlooked figure in the 196os move- ment that critic Clement Greenberg dubbed "post-painterly abstraction." Applying acrylic paint to raw canvas with the help of masking tape, Zox created memorable visual structures that complicated and extended the achievements of Kenneth Noland. This gift includes two early collages; with another painting already in the collection, it gives the Fogg unusual strength in Zox's work.</page><page sequence="16">U Of Drawings Th6odore Gericault French, 1791-1824 Four Studies of a Severed Head, c. 1818 Graphite on cream laid paper, 21 X 28.1 cm Fogg Art Museum, Bequest of Richard B. Sisson and through the generosity of Anthony and Celeste Meier, 2005.137 This year, the Drawing Department was the fortunate beneficiary of a bequest from Richard B. Sisson that included this arresting sheet. Th6odore Gericault's elegant pencil technique belies the grisly subject of his study of anguished emotion, which is close in date to his monumental masterpiece The Raft of the Medusa (Musee du Louvre). The artist obtained the head from Bicetre Institution for the aged, criminal, and insane and kept it on his studio roof for 15 days to draw and paint it continually. Odilon Redon French, 1840-1916 Chimera, c. 1880-95 Charcoal on buff wove paper, 50.9 x 37.8 cm Fogg Art Museum, Bequest of Richard B. Sisson and through the generosity of Anthony and Celeste Meier, 2005.131 This striking "noir" (finished charcoal drawing) is one of three drawings by Odilon Redon that entered the Art Museums' collections as part of the Sisson bequest. An impressive example of the artist's most accomplished techniques in charcoal, it combines two common images from Redon's dark symbolist landscapes: the hybrid Chimera and the floating, sorrowful head. In presenting a mythical monster with human features and emotions, Redon created a powerful metaphor of mortality and artistic creation that exploits the tension between the visible and invisible worlds of reality and imagination.</page><page sequence="17">* I IA' - 4Ji - S. -_ -- .2 *--s' - -. 41p' 'V F 'A is ''I U I - -- Prints Antonio Lafrery, publisher and editor Italian, 1512-1577 Album of Ornament Prints, c. 1570 205 engravings on 156 pages bound together within a brown leather binding, 35 X 24 x 4 cm Fogg Art Museum, Gift of Edith I. Welch in honor of Marjorie B. Cohn and Craigen Bowen, M26624 Antonio Lafrery, the leading Roman print pub- lisher of the i6th century, assembled this album of ornament prints, most likely to serve as a model book for an artist, designer, or architect. The 205 engravings contained within it are by the most renowned printmakers of the age, including Agostino Veneziano and Enea Vico, and have remained in brilliant condition. It is the only album of Lafrery's ornament prints known to have survived intact. Hendrick Goltzius Dutch, 1558-1617 Landscape with Farmhouse, c. 1597-1600 Chiaroscuro woodcut, 11.7 x 14.7 cm Fogg Art Museum, Light-Outerbridge Collection, Gift of Robert M. Light and Anonymous Fund for the Acquisition of Prints Older than 150 Years, M26576 Although Landscape with Farmhouse depicts a typically Dutch thatched cottage situated in the countryside, Hendrick Goltzius's models for this landscape print were undoubtedly Italian. Goltzius's 1590-91 trip to Italy inspired his interest in landscape and the Venetian masters, and the long, rhythmic lines are remi- niscent of Titian's woodcuts. The tonal quality of this chiaroscuro woodcut was achieved by printing from three blocks: two were inked with shades of green to enhance the printed black lines.

Stillman, class of 1907, by exchange, 2006.24.1 After seeing an exhibition of Japanese color woodcuts in Paris in 1890, Mary Cassatt began her own experiments in color printing. Using two copperplates, she achieved the combination of sharp lines and areas of texture and tone in this final state of The Bath. The Fogg Art Museum also acquired seven preliminary states of the print: the succession is a superb demonstration of the artistic and technical negotiations necessary to achieve a complex color intaglio print.</page><page sequence="19">U 0 n a tF. 0 I _.

It depicts an effective synthesis of Arts and Crafts elements placed in a shallow space and bathed in soft low light that casts long evocative shadows across the picture plane. Seeley experimented broadly with photographic media including the luscious autochrome, an early color process realized on glass transparencies that were viewed using trans- mitted light on the mirrored surface of a handheld diascope.</page><page sequence="20">U IL.. rr .1 Man Ray American, 1890-1976 Mathematcal Object (Equaton), 1934-36 Gelatin silver print, 18 x 23.5 cm Fogg Art Museum, Richard and Ronay Menschel Fund for the Acquisition of Photographs, P2005.15 In 1934 Max Ernst introduced his friend Man Ray to a collection in Paris's Institut Henri Poincare of 1gth-century mathematical objects depicting complex algebraic equations. The dramatic lighting and viewpoints confounding scale in Man Ray's photographs transmuted the dusty models into alien biomorphic land- scapes and fantastical anthropomorphic forms. Mathematical Object (Equation) was published in a 1936 issue of Cahiers d'Art that featured it among other examples of the "uncanny" in Surrealist found objects.

Bolton Ill Fund, P2006.21.7 Vera Lutter's haunting photographs of industry are made using a camera obscura that requires exposures of hours, days, or even months to produce ethereal images encapsulating the theater of modernity. This is one in a series of such images that explore modes of trans- porting cargo from one port to another. Lutter relates the transfer of merchandise and mate- rials to the transfer of light within her camera obscura, which is itself constructed from a shipping container.</page><page sequence="21">&lt;B 4. 4. &amp; . 7 K. ,. BUSCH-REISINGER MUSEUM Marianne Brandt German, 1893-1983 Untitled (with Anna May Wong), 1929 Photomontage of newspaper clippings with glass, celluloid, and metal on off-white cardboard; 67 x 50 cm Busch-Reisinger Museum, Purchase through the generosity of the Friends of the Busch-Reisinger Museum and their Acquisitions Committee, and Richard and Priscilla Hunt, Elizabeth C. Lyman, Mildred Rendl-Marcus, and Sylvia de Cuevas, 2006.25 Best known as a designer of Bauhaus metal- work, Marianne Brandt also produced an accomplished body of work in photomontage. This piece, incorporating an image of the Hollywood star Anna May Wong and other exemplars of female beauty, is exceptional for both its size and complexity. It wittily and provocatively treats many of Brandt's key themes: the image of women in a mass-media culture, the role of woman as artist, the appeal of beauty, and the exotic. Paul Klee German, 1879-1940 Falling Asleep, 1935 Oil and watercolor on paper with a chalk ground, mounted to card; 23.9 X 23.3 cm (sight) Busch-Reisinger Museum, Gift of Richard M. Bennett, 2005.113 Completed shortly after Paul Klee's return to his native Switzerland, this drawing comple- ments the Busch-Reisinger's already strong holdings of the artist's work and represents a transitional moment in his life and career. Simultaneously whimsical and serene, the rich jewel tones of the drawing refer back to the light experimentation begun in the artist's Bauhaus years, while the pared-down compo- sition of the central figure anticipates the starkly reduced linear forms that typify the final great works of his career.
