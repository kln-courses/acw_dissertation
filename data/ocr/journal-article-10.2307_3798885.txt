"I can't keep up with the literature" is a lament heard regularly these days. Fortunately, some bibliophiles find the time and patience to provide us with syntheses of the literature in areas of ac- tive research. Sadleir's book is a superb summary of research concerned with the ecology of mam- malian reproduction. He has skillfully summarized our knowledge of the effects of environmental fac- tors, both physical and biotic, upon puberty, the breeding season, pregnancy, parturition, lactation, and post-natal survival of both domestic and wild mammalian species. A brief discussion of the role of man in the ecology of breeding animals con- cludes the book. Sadleir cautiously accepts Spencer's and Stein- hoff's hypothesis regarding the relationship of litter size to altitude and latitude. He cites Hoffman's report, now 11 years old, of the positive correla- tion between the crude protein content of grasses and the litter size of certain microtines, a finding worthy of further investigation. A similar distillation of the literature for other vertebrate groups, birds for example, would be welcome. Hopefully someone, perhaps Sadleir, will find the time and patience for such an under- taking.-DONALD R. JOHNSON, Department of Bio- logical Science, University of Idaho, Moscow. Ecology and Behaviour of the Black Rhinoc- eros (Diceros bicornis L.). A Field Study. By R. Schenkel and L. Schenkel-Hullinger. Mam- malia depicta, 1969. Paul Parey, Hamburg and Berlin. 100pp. DM28,-. The Schenkels have produced a publication on the black rhinoceros which will be of considerable interest to wildlife workers, and all those inter- ested in conservation and natural history. Their report is based on a short field study of the rhinoceros population in a small area of Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Tsavo is considered as one of the last strongholds of distribution of the black rhinoceros; parts of the park are undergoing progressive ecological change from Commiphora woodland to bush grassland and open grassland. The change has been initiated by tremendous de- struction of the woodland by elephant, and is ag- gravated by fire. The question is posed whether or not the black rhinoceros can survive this trans- formation of its habitat. The text is divided into two major sections: (1) Ecology, (2) Sociology and Behavior. It con- cludes with a short summary. The major section 662 on ecology includes five general sub-sections, dealing with the habitat of the mammal in part of Tsavo, including a list of plants eaten by rhinoceros, and the relationship between the rhi- noceros and other vertebrate species. Sub-sections on parasites and diseases, aggressions and intra- specific intolerance, and biological characters of the population of a selected area, are also included. The major section on behavior deals in part with diurnal activity patterns, group structure, re- actions to other vertebrates, ritualized and non- ritualized behavior patterns, mating behavior, and a description of the bond between mother and calf. This section is supported with meticulous descrip- tions and extensive documentation of certain aspects of behavior. Descriptions in general are excellent, but are sometimes anthropomorphic, for example, the interpretation of reactions of the black rhinoceros to man in a car. Parts of the publication tend toward generaliza- tions, based on very little or no quantitative data, but this is perhaps inevitable in a field study of this kind. The authors state categorically that the black rhinoceros do not live in territories, are no- madic to a large degree within the study area, and that the population of Tsavo East is approximately 1,000 individuals. Unfortunately, none of these statements are supported with precise quantitative data. In spite of this criticism, the text is packed with interesting and useful observations of the black rhinoceros. The critical question, posed in the foreword, and referred to in the summary, that is, whether the black rhinoceros will survive in the changing environment, is still a subject of debate. In the summary, the authors suggest that it may be "the task of man as a conservationist to actively maintain a certain natural equilibrium within the wildlife sanctuaries."-JoHN GODDARD, 417 N.

Academic Press, Inc., New York. 1968. xix,429pp. $19.50. This volume covers the proceedings of a sym- posium held at the Zoological Society of London on November 10-11, 1966. Thirty-five contributors and sixteen discussants took part and together with the editor and three session chairmen they have produced a worthwhile contribution to the fund of knowledge on the nutrition of wildlife. The material, presented as separate papers, covers a diverse array of topics ranging from diets of laboratory primates and nutrition of zoo animals to a report on wild reindeer in Norway, ptarmigan</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 663 in Iceland and Scotland, and a discussion on rear- ing and utilizing eland in the Russian Ukraine. Eight of the total of 26 papers deal with studies of African species and most are centered on East Africa. Among these are several which shed light on hitherto little explored facets of the ecology of African species. C. R. Taylor's report on "The minimum water requirements of some East African bovids" gives excellent insight into the complex of morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations used by eland, oryx, and Grant's gazelle which allow them to exist independently of free water sources. The paper by S. K. Sikes on arterial disease in the African elephant and that by R. M. Laws and I. S. C. Parker, "Recent studies on elephant populations in East Africa," both point out the effect of habitat, stocking rates, and consequent quality of diets on the health and reproduction of elephants. The primary relationship of importance emerging from these two studies is that the health of elephants is better when they have access to woody vegeta- tion to supplement their basic diet of grass. This appears to be especially important during the dry season when the protein value of grass is very low, but browse retains a higher nutrient content. Although these investigations are purely observa- tional in that they were directed toward elucidating the effects of range type and condition on the elephants, these relationships present a fascinating area for more detailed work to explain the precise nutritional deficiencies involved. Of major importance from an ecological and management standpoint is the fact that overstock- ing by elephants themselves, with consequent elimination of much of the woody vegetation over large areas of range-land, is a primary self-induced influence causing deterioration of their habitat. Such relationships are, of course, well documented for overpopulations of large herbivores in many parts of the world, but the macro-scale self-destruc- tion of elephant ranges in East and Central Africa is awesome to behold. R. R. Hofmann's paper on rumen and omasal structure in relation to food habits of East African species gives excellent anatomical detail. He also documents some most interesting changes in num- bers of rumen papillae associated with age, and his anatomical preparations of viscera fixed in situ with specimens in a standing position are most useful for comparative purposes. On less firm ground, however, are his conclusions on dietary relationships. For example, he cites water- buck, reedbuck, and Uganda kob as specialized types living and feeding in the wet environments of swamps and riverbanks. Actually, although these species may on occasion visit such sites, their habitat is typically in upland savannah areas well removed from swampy situations. No doubt when food habits of the wide array of African ruminants are better understood, functional adapta- tions of their digestive anatomy will be easier to explain. It is unfortunate that relatively few workers are devoting their efforts to comparative studies of wildlife nutrition and perhaps for this reason several papers were included which deal mostly with data gathered from domestic species and even humans. While certain of the basic relation- ships they show are very probably applicable to wild species, it would seem more appropriate to have confined this symposium more closely to its stated purpose. As pointed out by the editor, however, there is a remarkable similarity of basic nutritional requirements among wild species, even those which exist at different trophic levels. These requirements appear to be met by diversity of diet or specialized anatomical, physiological, or be- havioral adaptations which permit the exploitation of specialized environmental niches. Collectively, the papers presented in the pro- ceedings of this symposium are to be highly recommended to those interested in comparative nutrition.-WILLIAM M. LONGHURST, Department of Agricultural Zoology, University of California, Davis. The World of the Giant Panda. By Richard Perry. Taplinger Publishing Co., New York. 1969. 136pp. $7.50. The reviewer, unacquainted with the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), found this book informative, stimulating, and a joy to read, for it records in about 100 well-printed, easily read, pages the great bulk of the world's knowledge about the species. Indeed, Mr. Perry states: "So far as I am aware, every pertinent reference to it or its environment is included here." The selected bibliography consist of 23 books and 65 journal references. The remaining 30-odd pages consist of a very good index, and numerous good to excellent black and white photographs, some repetitive, and nearly all of captive animals. I read the book almost at one sitting-it is not easily laid aside-and the following impressions, not in the order given by the author, stand out: the giant panda (1) is more common in the wild (central Asian mountain masses) than formerly believed; (2) has a nearly unlimited food supply (bamboo) at all seasons; (3) inhabits a range estimated at about 400,000 square miles; (4) is relatively free of predation and human harassment in vast bamboo forests on extremely rugged moun- tain terrain; (5) may pass short periods in winter in a quiescent state; (6) is of uncertain philo- genetic position, as indicated by certain structural and chemo-physical characters similar to those of</page></plain_text>
