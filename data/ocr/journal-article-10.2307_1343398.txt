<plain_text><page sequence="1">Can the Arts Survive Modernism? (A Discussion of the Characteristics, History, and Legacy of Modernism) George Rochberg It is as if they had finally confronted that nothingness that takes up so much space in modern art and philosophy. -ANATOLE BROYARD, New York Times Book Review First, I want to ask a series of three questions, the answers to which I hope will help bring out the larger implications inherent in the title question: (1) What exactly is modernism? And how can it best be characterized? (2) What is its historical background? What stages has modernism gone through? And why are we now in what literary, art, and architecture critics are calling the "postmodern" period? (3) What is the legacy of modernism in the arts? What did modernism do to the arts to change them so radically? At the conclusion of this essay, I will answer the question which the title raises. 1. What Is Modernism and How Can It Best Be Characterized? In trying to say what modernism is (or was), we must remind ourselves that it cannot and must not-to be properly described and understood- Critical Inquiry 11 (December 1984) ? 1984 by The University of Chicago. 0093-1896/84/1102-0009$01.00.

Modernism can be said to embrace, in the broadest terms, not only the arts of Western culture but also science, technology, the family, marriage, sexuality, economics, the politics of democracy, the politics of authoritarianism, the politics of totalitarianism, and such ac- ademic disciplines as philosophy and the social sciences of sociology and anthropology (among others). Its influence and effects have been all- pervasive. No corner of twentieth-century life has escaped its profound alteration of both the individual and society. It has radicalized all levels of human existence. What, then, is modernism? Some have described it as a state of "chronic revolution," that is, revolution against the past, against tradition, against history itself. Others have pointed to its voracious appetite for innovation, for the search for the "new," for the hunger to be "original"-to be the first and last with something unique and different, whatever that something might be or in whatever area of human endeavor it might arise. Still others have characterized modernism as the application to all realms of human life of forms of structural rationalization, that is, finding rationally structured ways of being and doing regardless of consequences and, more especially, rationalizing away the mysteries and questions which have to do with meaning, that is, morality and ethics-those areas that lie outside the purely rational. And still others have viewed modernism as a condition of freedom within which the individual can be himself, unfettered and uninhibited, released from the drag of superego and conscience, a separate entity of being, unanswerable to others whether in the form of individuals or society as a whole. Last but not least, there are those who continue to see modernism as a self-perpetuating form of avant-gardism, always at the point of the interface between the present and the future, always ready to move on to the next stage because living itself is a process of constant change, constant motion, perpetual transformation. In order to get closer to a more detailed characterization of modernism and its effects, I will have to range far and wide, risking, I realize, a certain coherence but at the same time gaining a certain breadth which I feel is essential in dealing with the entire question. George Rochberg is the composer of a large body of musical works and the author of a recently published collection of essays, The Aesthetics of Survival, A Composer's View of Twentieth-Century Music. He is currently writing his fifth symphony, on a commission from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 1983 he retired from the University of Pennsylvania as Emeritus Annenberg Professor of the Humanities. Can the Arts Survive?</page><page sequence="3">Critical Inquiry December 1984 The following passage from the essay "Philosophy in America Today" by Richard Rorty is a good place to start: This split between two sorts of intellectuals has become deeper in our own century. It is, indeed, no mere matter of academic politics. It is the split imprecisely sketched by Snow's contrast between the scientific culture and the literary culture. It is the antagonism that begins to become explicit when analytic philosophers mutter about the irrationalism that rages in literature departments and when Continental philosophers become shrill about the lack of human significance in the works of the analysts. It is the difference between the intellectual who believes that something like the application of scientific method is the best hope of human freedom and the in- tellectual who, with Foucault and Heidegger, sees this notion of scientific method as the mask behind which lurks the cruelty and despair of a nihilistic age.' Rorty could have pointed to the French biologist Jacques Monod and his book Chance and Necessity as one of the chief proponents of the conviction that twentieth-century man's best hope does, in fact, lie in giving up all forms of animism and metaphysics and placing himself, without qualm, in the hands of rationalism and science. On the other side, Rorty could have referred to the gathering momentum of the antinuclear energy movement and the antinuclear war movement in Europe and America, movements undoubtedly led by intellectuals but not confined to them and, in fact, embracing millions of human beings from every walk and level of world society. This split on the philosophic-scientific level is mirrored in a split in the arts but in a somewhat different way-although under closer examination the difference does not appear to be quite so great. Hilton Kramer, the former New York Times art critic, in his article "The Age of the Avant-Garde" writes: The history of the avant-garde actually harbors a complex agenda of internal conflict and debate, not only about aesthetic matters but about the social values that govern them.... At one extreme, there is indeed an intransigent radicalism that categorically refuses to acknowledge the contingent and rather fragile character of the cultural enterprise, a radicalism that cancels all debts to the past in the pursuit of a new vision, however limited and fragmentary and circumscribed, and thus feels at liberty-in fact, compelled-to sweep [away] anything and everything in the path of its own im- mediate goals, whatever the consequences ... But the history of the avant-garde is by no means confined to these partisans of wholesale revolt. It also boasts its champions of harmony and tradition. It is actually among the latter that we are likely to find the most solid and enduring achievements of the modern era-among those tra- 319</page><page sequence="4">320 George Rochberg dition-haunted artists (Matisse and Picasso, Eliot and Yeats, Schoen- berg and Stravinsky) who are mindful, above all, of the continuity of culture and thus committed to the creative renewal of its deepest impulses.2 Thus far my developing picture of modernism shows deep divisions brought on by what Kramer calls "intransigent radicalism." In philosophy, the split is between those who uphold the notion that science and technology are man's best hope for salvation and those who see them as a clear and present danger to man's survival; in the arts, the split is between the intransigently radical avant-gardists who deny everything but their own ideas and those who believe in the continuity of civilization and its endur- ing values. At this point it becomes important to bring into the discussion a unique characteristic of modernism which these sharp divisions bring to the fore with enormous clarity, that is, the domination of the reductive, single idea in both the intellectual culture and the artistic culture. Of course, there is no single "single idea" anywhere; rather, there are many single ideas contending for attention and dominance. Nevertheless, it is possible to suggest that whatever the nature of these single ideas might be in the intellectual or artistic world, they themselves come under one single rubric: rationalization. This is to say, rationalization is the foundation of all present-day thinking which accepts scientific method as its base and fount. I choose "rationalization" rather than "reason" because what we witness in modernism is reason itself observed in the act of self- justification-rationalization-ruling out of existence any alternate ways of viewing the same or similar phenomena. This process is especially rife in the intellectual world and, therefore, in our universities. It takes a somewhat different form in the arts, where we find individual artists pursuing single gestures or attitudes to the exclusion of other possible gestures and attitudes. Such artists were, in fact, dubbed "one-idea" artists by Harold Rosenberg, the late art critic. The question of originality in art and life has a significant bearing on the point of the single idea in that the view or act which is singular to itself and unlike all other views or acts is, of course, what people tend, these days, to call "original" or "being original." In the sharp-witted article "What to Do When You Don't Live in a Golden Age," Robert Nisbet writes: Next it is good to be original, or better an original, in an ungolden age. The quest for originality is boundless in America at the present time, and if it is more often than not the kind of originality we see in a two-headed calf, it doesn't matter. To wear a (Bill) Blass or (Calvin) Klein original is the dream of every poseur, and it does not matter a whit that in any given year such an original may be Can the Arts Survive?</page><page sequence="5">Critical Inquiry December 1984 aesthetically revolting or totally without comfort and utility. The feverish competition in the sciences for earliest publication-so candidly revealed for us by James Watson in his book on the search for the double helix-is at bottom a craving for originality, for being first with the first. The Guiness Book of World Records holds virtually totemic place in our imaginations. The quest for originality is our leaden substitute for a golden age's quest for perfection. The builders of the Parthenon were not seeking originality but perfection. So was Plato; so were Vergil, Dante, Shakespeare and Goethe. So were Copernicus, Newton, Maxwell, Mendel and Einstein. Or, if not perfection, reality, the truth. But not originality. The best protection civilization has against the quest for orig- inality is similar to that which exists in the biological world-to wit, the sterility of the strictly original. Two-headed calves do not re- produce, nor do other monstrosities. I believe the same holds and has always held in the history of culture. The calculatedly original piece of work is unlikely to produce progeny. We may therefore take comfort that the two-headed calves painted by our modernist- futurist paint-spatterers, designed by our Bauhaus-spawned archi- tects, and written by our Mailers, Barthelmes, and Pynchons will not yield much in the way of issue.3 Nisbet's indictment of the quest for originality, a hallmark of modernism, might strike a modernist aficionado as so many intellectual sour grapes from a man who can only talk but can't spatter paint or design glass- wall skyscrapers or write best-selling fiction. What would such a devout modernist think, then, when confronted by chapter 44 of Herman Melville's Confidence Man? "QUITE AN ORIGINAL:" A phrase, we fancy, rather oftener used by the young, or the unlearned, or the untraveled, than by the old, or the well-read, or the man who has made the grand tour. Certainly, the sense of originality exists at its highest in an infant, and probably at its lowest in him who has completed the circle of the sciences. As for original characters in fiction, a grateful reader will, on meeting with one, keep the anniversary of that day. True, we some- times hear of an author who, at one creation, produces some two or three score such characters; it may be possible. But they can hardly be original in the sense that Hamlet is, or Don Quixote, or Milton's Satan. That is to say, they are not, in a thorough sense, original at all. They are novel, or singular, or striking, or captivating, or all four at once. More likely, they are what are called odd characters; but for that, are no more original, than what is called an odd genius, in his way, is.... Where does any novelist pick up any character? For the most part, in town, to be sure. Every great town is a kind of man-show, 321</page><page sequence="6">322 George Rochberg Can the Arts Survive? where the novelist goes for his stock, just as the agriculturist goes to the cattle-show for his. But in the one fair, new species of quad- rupeds are hardly more rare, than in the other are new species of characters-that is, original ones. Their rarity may still the more appear from this, that, while characters, merely singular, imply but singular forms, so to speak, original ones, truly so, imply original instincts. In short, a due conception of what is to be held for this sort of personage in fiction would make him almost as much of a prodigy there, as in real history is a new law-giver, a revolutionizing phi- losopher, or the founder of a new religion.... Furthermore, if we consider, what is popularly held to entitle characters in fiction being deemed original, is but something per- sonal-confined to itself. The character sheds not its characteristic on its surroundings, whereas, the original character, essentially such, is like a revolving Drummond light, raying away from itself all round it-everything is lit by it, everything starts up to it (mark how it is with Hamlet), so that, in certain minds, there follows upon the adequate conception of such a character, an effect, in its way, akin to that which in Genesis attends upon the beginning of things.... There would seem to be one point in common between this sort of phenomenon in fiction and all other sorts: it cannot be born in the author's imagination-it being as true in literature as in zoology, that all life is from the egg.4 Reductionism in modernist thinking, that is, the urge to simplify down to basics, the passion for removing all paradoxical conditions arising out of opposites or polarities, is very much a twentieth-century preoc- cupation and was pursued in many areas simultaneously: the composition of music, music theory, architecture, painting, and philosophy.5 We have but to think of Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus school of design, or Mies van der Rohe, and we can see with our inner eye the urban landscape of glass boxes which marks most large American cities, with their char- acteristic modern look of stripped down, nonornamental, heartless but clean-lined functionalism. In music, as in philosophy, reductionism is more difficult to perceive because it does not present itself to the eye. It is much more difficult to grasp reductionist tendencies when dealing with the esoterica of musical composition, music theory, or philosophy. Let me therefore briefly outline the presence of reductionism in music, both composition and theory. In the same decade of the 1920s, when the Bauhaus formed its school and Vasily Kandinsky turned to nonobjective painting, Arnold Schoenberg announced his method of composing with twelve tones, and Heinrich Schenker came out with his method of musical analysis. Both were systems which aimed at new ways of organizing the respective processes of composing and analyzing music. What they share in common</page><page sequence="7">December 1984 323 is the principle that all operations having to do with pitch organization derive from a single, basic "law." In Schoenberg's case, the "law" was the principle of the single row (or series) of twelve chromatic pitches which governed the musical ideas to which it gave rise. In most instances, the row itself cannot be discerned as a row; that is, it cannot be heard as such. What the listener hears are the musical patterns and configurations which derive from the row which guides and governs the composer's thinking. The row per se remains unheard and inaudible below or behind the audible surface of the music. What Schenker did was to go in exactly the opposite direction: by starting from a desire to explain analytically the deep, hidden organic structure of classical tonal music, he first stripped away the audible surface, what he called the "foreground." Thus his first reduction of meaningful pitch organization brought him to what he called the "middleground," which, I must point out, cannot be heard as such in Bach or Mozart or Brahms. Finally, he arrived at what he called the "background," where the urlinie, or fundamental line of pitch motion, was discovered. By this process of analytic reduction, he found what he believed was the Ur- structure of classical music. In this way, he proved to himself and his disciples and followers (of which there are now many in American university music departments) that classical tonal music rests on simple, basic laws of pitch motion and organization. In the process of subjecting the music of the past to this rational analytic method, he reduced all the great works to essentially the same organic structure, erasing from view the individual qualities and characteristics which distinguish Beethoven from Brahms, Schubert from Mozart, and so forth-all in the name of discovering the basic law of tonality. Obviously, it follows that, if the middleground cannot be heard, neither can the urlinie (or background). Both Schoenberg and Schenker were dealing, from opposite directions, with what they genuinely believed were musical "laws" which lie behind the audible surface. The irony of the situation is best brought out by the story told about Schoenberg, who, after perusing Schenker's analysis of Beethoven's Eroica, was supposed to have said: "But where are my favorite melodies?" Behind the modern movements in music, architecture, painting, and philosophy is the desire to see, understand, and grasp the basic "simples" governing artistic and intellectual construction. The assumption is implicit, but rarely stated, that the universe and man's work in the universe are ultimately reducible to "simple," rationally comprehensible elements. The story of analytic philosophy and logical positivism is equally instructive and worth going into briefly here. Referring to the tepid response of American intellectuals generally to existentialism in the 1950s, William Barrett attributes their lack of interest not only to the dominance of Marxism in their thinking-and therefore the incompatibility of Marxism and existentialism-but also to Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="8">324 George Rochberg Can the Arts Survive? the resistance provided by Positivism, which had just begun to take its grip on American philosophers and whose attitudes had even begun to spread beyond the academy. Positivism was then in its most aggressive phase, and its general appeal, especially for the young, was the apparent tough-mindedness of its stance. All that can be known, it said, was science; and beyond that we may express our emotions but we cannot take those expressions for knowledge. And forthwith the great bulk of traditional philosophy was discovered to be speaking "nonsense." This was a great boon for all those who would just as well forget the past anyway, and an especial convenience for the young professionals in philosophy who were thus spared the trouble of studying those past philosophers.6 By concentrating on the fate of Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy expressed in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, we can draw closer still to an under- standing and perception of modernism, this time exerting its special coloration on the twentieth-century mind's view of the structure of reality. Seen from the purely historical, that is, linear, sequential point of view, the story of Wittgenstein's treatise and its impact on the English School of Analytic Philosophy as well as the logical positivist Vienna Circle is the story of the crystallization of modernism in philosophy. The fact that Wittgenstein himself had not intended this result is beside the point here, just as is the paradox that Wittgenstein had intended not a rationalization of language per se but rather that what he called "higher" things-morality, ethics-necessarily fell outside the rational uses of language. Both the English and Viennese philosophers took only that part of what Wittgenstein had said rather than what he had not said but strongly implied and built up their own philosophic convictions with the assistance of his radical separation of fact from value. The Tractatus (published in 1919) was based on the symbolic logic of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege which Wittgenstein took as the means by which he could "provide a generalized critique of language capable of doingjustice both to Hertz and to Kierkegaard."7 The English used Tractatus as the basis for crystallizing analytic philosophy ("Calculus of Language") before World War I. After World War I, in the 1920s, the Vienna Circle (Rudolf Carnap, Moritz Schlick, Friedrich Waismann) took up the study of Tractatus and advanced their own logical positivist position. Allan Janik and Stephen Toulmin describe what happened: Almost from the moment of its publication, the nature and purpose of Wittgenstein's Tractatus gave rise to misunderstandings among his Viennese contemporaries.... If one only sets aside those last five pages (Proposition 6.3 on), the intellectual techniques de- veloped in the rest of the book lend themselves to quite different uses, both in mathematics and in philosophy, and can be quoted in support of intellectual attitudes quite antagonistic to Wittgenstein's</page><page sequence="9">December 1984 325 own. As a result, both in England and in Vienna itself, the Tractatus became the foundation stone of a new positivism or empiricism; and this developed into a thoroughgoing antimetaphysical movement, which held out scientific knowledge as the model of what rational men should believe.... At this point, therefore, we must look briefly at the origins of these other philosophical movements -Cambridge "analytical philosophy" and Viennese "logical positivism"-and see how a document written as the final and definitive stage in post- Kantian "transcendental philosophy," in order to liberate ethics from any kind of science-based empiricism, could at once be stood on its head and used to justify reimposingjust such an empiricist system.8 Both movements come together in American academic philosophy and represent modernism's furthermost penetration of the intellectual attempt to grasp the nature of language as a rational tool and its relation to the world, in the process separating "fact," the propositions of science, from "value," statements about the meaning of life and the problem of ethics. This is confirmed by Rorty when he says: In the early 1950's analytic philosophy began to take over American philosophy departments. The great emigres--Carnap, Hempel, Feigl, Reichenbach, Bergmann, Tarski-began to be treated with the respect they deserved. Their disciples began to be appointed to, and to dominate, the most prestigious departments. Departments that did not go along with this trend began to lose prestige. By 1960, a new set of philosophical paradigms was in place.... Dewey and White- head, heroes of the previous generation, were no longer read.... The history of philosophy was decisively downgraded and ... the study of logic assumed an importance previously given to the study of languages.... According to the hopes of the logical positivists, the advent of this new generation should have given rise to an unprecedented era of cooperation, teamwork, and agreement on results attained.... This did not happen.... In the interlocking central areas of analytic philosophy-epistemology, philosophy of language and metaphysics-there are now as many paradigms as there are major philosophy departments.... The field these days is a jungle of competing research programs, programs that seem to have a shorter and shorter half-life as the years go by.9 Rorty is describing a kind of philosophic pluralism which only adds still more confusion to the general cultural Tower of Babel that exists in society-at-large. Though not his conscious intention, Rorty is telling the story of how modernism's Iron Age (post-World War II to the present) in America corroded the heart of the philosophic enterprise. What hap- pened in academic philosophy parallels what happened in the arts them- Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="10">326 George Rochberg Can the Arts Survive? selves-in or out of academia. I shall return later to the topic of pluralism and the metaphor of the Iron Age. Before we leave Wittgenstein, I want to describe briefly what he had intended. According to Janik and Toulmin, Wittgenstein's models showed the limits of what they were capable of saying: they modeled the way things were in the world, and accordingly made scientific knowledge of phenomena possible, but they could do nothing more. This was clear from the nature of the models themselves; they were not even capable of representing any- thing that was not factual. Thus Wittgenstein says, "And so it is impossible for there to be propositions of ethics"; and he at once goes on to add-rather startlingly-"Propositions can express nothing that is higher." . . . The word "higher" intimates that there is more to the doctrine of "showing" than the model theory, for Wittgenstein goes on to pronounce in the next proposition that-like logic- "Ethics is transcendental." Therefore, questions about "ethics, value and the meaning of life" fell outside the limits of his descriptive language and could be conveyed only by "indirect" or poetical communication [that is, through art .... ] As Paul Engelmann has put it: "Positivism holds-and this is its essence- that what we can speak about is all that matters in life. Whereas Wittgenstein passionately believes that all that really matters in human life is precisely what, in his view, we must be silent about."'0 In short, Wittgenstein was saying, if I understand him at all, that what I call the "metaphysical gap" is real and lies outside the limits of reason or approaches to understanding through the uses of the tools of reason. I shall get back to the "metaphysical gap" later. 2. What Is the Historical Background of Modernism and What Stages Has It Gone Through? It is not possible to discuss the beginnings of modernism without mentioning the manifestos of the Italian Futurists which burst forth in 1909. The Futurists were extraordinarily skillful propagandists and po- lemicists. Knowing that Paris was the artistic, cultural nerve center of Europe, they arranged to have their fiery messages published there rather than in Italy-and the world listened. They were consumed by a veritable fever of revolution against the past. They hurled their cries and war whoops to destroy the past against the bourgeois establishment of Europe. They wanted to be done with, once and for all, as they saw it, the old</page><page sequence="11">December 1984 327 rotten and rotting world of art and culture. In 1909, in the very first Futurist manifesto, F. T. Marinetti could say: Come on! set fire to the library shelves! Turn aside the canals to flood the museums! ... Oh, the joy of seeing the glorious old canvases bobbing adrift on those waters, discoloured and shredded! ... Take up your pickaxes, your axes and hammers and wreck, wreck the venerable cities, pitilessly!" We are only beginning to appreciate the ferocity with which the modern movement began. A whole generation seems to have made up its mind to effect a new creation, a new Genesis-wipe the slate clean, erase every vestige of what had been. Walter Benjamin writes in his Reflections: "When the age laid hands upon itself, he [Karl Kraus] was the hands," Brecht said. Few insights can stand beside this, and certainly not the comment of his friend Adolf Loos. "Kraus," he declares, "stands on the frontier of a new age." Alas, by no means. For he stands on the threshold of the Last Judgment.'2 In its beginnings modernism was apocalyptic. As apocalypse, it was pro- phetic. The history of twentieth-century modernism is, up to about 1950, mainly a European story. This has been made eminently clear by such intellectual-cultural historians as Carl Schorske in his book Fin-de-Siecle Vienna, by Janik and Toulmin in their Wittgenstein's Vienna, and, more recently, by Marshall Berman in his All That Is Solid Melts into Air. It is a story of bitter struggle against ossified autocracies, of the simultaneous emergence of political and social liberalism, on the one hand, and nationalist reactionary conservatism, on the other, of the rapid development of industrialization and technology, of the redesigning and building up of two of the major cities and nerve centers of Europe-Paris and Vienna. But mostly it is a story of the desire to remove the heavy burden of the past, to set aside old traditions and old values, old ways of hearing, seeing, thinking, and feeling-in short, a total overhaul of European civilization. I should like to apply a mythic metaphor in order to describe mod- ernism in terms more amenable to my purpose here. Let me put it this way: modernism's Age of Gold and Age of Silver occurred somewhere between the turn of the century and the opening guns of World War I. While it is impossible to say where one ends and the other begins, those were the glory years when European painters, composers, writers, scientists, thinkers were drunk on the dreams of a new world. Modernism literally exploded into existence. It came on in one gigantic rush of freshly released energies and unbounded enthusiasms, accompanied by an inebriated Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="12">328 George Rochberg Can the Arts Survive? sense of newly discovered freedoms. It produced a virtual revolution on all levels of human consciousness and its perceptions and ideas of reality. The past receded rapidly, and, for many, there was the certain conviction that it had been put to rout utterly, never to haunt them again. Let me call the years between the end of World War I and the beginning of World War II (1918-39) the "Bronze Age." Clearly, during the 1920s and 1930s modernism lost its luster. The imaginative, intuitive discoveries of the Gold and Silver Ages gave way to rationalized system- atization. These decades saw the establishment of the twelve-tone method, of the Bauhaus school of design, of analytic philosophy and logical pos- itivism, of Kandinsky's nonobjective art (to which the first Guggenheim Museum in New York devoted itself exclusively). The earlier dreams of a new and unfettered future were replaced by a more sober mood, char- acterized by the formation of groups and schools of artists and thinkers making common cause together. World War II put an end to that phase, and the Iron Age of modernism set in. The question is, Did it take place in Europe? I don't think so; rather it took place in America after 1945, despite the high percentage of European emigres who came to America during the Hitler period to live and continue their work-Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, Bela Bart6k, Franz Werfel, Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, T. W. Adorno, and Carnap, among others. If my metaphor of the devolution of modernism from a Golden Age, starting around the turn of the century, to an Iron Age, ending around 1965-70, has any merit at all, it lies in revealing, in a general comparative sense, the difference between modernism beginning with a bang and ending in a whimper and, say, the development of the Baroque period in music which began modestly (if brilliantly, as we now see in the case of Claudio Monteverdi) around 1600 and gathered strength and power of expression as it moved to its historical apogee with Handel and Bach around 1750. Similarly, the beginnings of classicism in music are hardly spectacular but surely move to an enormous crescendo of power of ut- terance in Beethoven. The fact that virtually the best musical works of the modern period, exemplified in the output of Stravinsky, Bart6k, and Schoenberg, were produced before the start of World War II in Europe in 1939 tends to corroborate both the use of the mythic metaphor and the comparative generalizations following from it. There are two questions I wish to raise: first, Why didn't modernism begin in America rather than in Europe? and, second, Why did modernism, when it did come to America after World War II, enter its Iron Age? The answers to these questions must, admittedly, be highly speculative. But it is of the essence to probe these questions, because it appears to me that whatever of significance happens for Western culture, following on the demise of modernism, will happen in America-if it happens at all. If this is the case, our awareness of America's role in the next stage of world art and culture must take into account America's part in the</page><page sequence="13">December 1984 329 modern movement played out against the backdrop of the past eighty years. As to the first question, Why didn't modernism begin in America? the answer, as I see it, is twofold. First, given the nature of modernism, it could only have happened where it did: in Europe. It was there, not in America, that the burdens of history, of the past, and of tradition had accumulated, layer upon layer, and had come to oppress and stultify. America had no past to speak of, as compared to Europe. The centuries- old repressions of spirit and physical existence which weighed so heavily upon Europe created an enormous tension which demanded release. No such tension existed in America. There was no aristocracy, no class society, no cultural tradition, no proletariat, no bourgeoisie in the European sense of those terms. There already existed in America a spirit of freedom, especially freedom of movement politically, socially, and geographically which, in a certain sense, were the very things Europe needed and longed for. The second part of my answer to the question Why didn't modernism begin in America? leads me to a consideration of several phenomena which are difficult to deal with because they are paradoxical and anomalous: the pragmatic nature of the American spirit, the tendency toward ex- patriation in the early twentieth century, and the iconoclastic impulse characteristic of certain types of American artists. The invention of the skyscraper by Louis Sullivan is a purely American phenomenon. And, regardless of its impact on world architecture and its later evolution under the aegis of European ideas of functionalism, at its inception it was, primarily, a pragmatic act, having more to do with solving the practical problems of limited urban space in large American cities than with an aesthetic rejection of past architectural traditions. I believe Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural innovations can be viewed in a similar light. When we consider the expatriates T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound-not to mention Gertrude Stein-we recognize that their escape to England (or Europe) was motivated by an inability to identify themselves and their work with, what was for them, an incompatible spiritual environment. America was too uncivilized, too raw, too unsubtle. Earlier on, Henry James had reacted in exactly the same way. In Charles Ives we see the iconoclast, paradoxically in love with the past, who shares something of the probing, testing spirit of the American pragmatic-a quality also exemplified in music by such figures as Carl Ruggles, Dane Rudhyar, and John Becker, among others. What is important to bring out here is the simple fact that no unified American movement as such emerged from the efforts of these people. Eliot and Pound were out of it entirely, associating themselves with Europe as they did. And, even though in music Henry Cowell tried to pull together what was happening in America by publishing his magazine, Modern Music, American composers of that period had no impact on Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="14">330 George Rochberg their society comparable to the impact their European contemporaries had on theirs. In fact, it was not until the 1950s that America became aware at all of Ives as an important composer. Ives was, as Melville would say, an "isolato"-as in a peculiar sense, all American artists have always been (and remain). There is a good, though unfortunate, reason for this state of affairs. In a utilitarian society such as America where physical well-being and comfort have always been the chief aim, art has never been viewed as essential or of primary importance. The cultural and spiritual well-being of society played an insignificant role, and those who wanted to make art were forced into isolation by a society which took no interest in their dreams and desires. The fact that, as a young man, Ives made a conscious choice to become an insurance man rather than take his chances as an artist-in-society and struggle against tremendous odds, defines an essential difference between him and, let's say, an Arnold Schoenberg. Schoenberg, like all his colleagues of that period in Europe, set out to win his personal battle as an artist-in-society. That was the European tradition and had been for centuries. Ives sidestepped the issue, took refuge in business, and dreamed his dream of setting New England transcendentalism to music. That and the hymns of fundamentalist religion were Ives' personal traditions which he invented for himself because, given his predilections, he could base himself on little else. Ives' longing for the myth of the past "innocence" of America and his wonderfully naive faith in the "common man," itself an American myth of the time, were directly opposite to the European artist's hunger for a future in which he would be freed of all past obligations. Clearly, America did not need "modernism" as did Europe, nor could America have provided the necessary conditions in which modernism could have flourished and flowered. What of the second question, Why did modernism enter its Iron Age when it came to America after World War II? The answer is more difficult, in a sense, because the complexities of the world situation which existed following the end of World War II do not permit easy interpre- tations. Not only had victory turned America into a world power but the situation in Europe and Asia had altered radically. Europe was spiritually and physically exhausted, and Asia was just beginning to enter the modern world of industrialization and technology. Culturally, America was entering the modern world under the direct influence of major European figures such as Andre Breton, van der Rohe, Schoenberg, and Stravinsky. (While Bart6k's music had a powerful impact on the younger generation of American composers in the 1950s, his personal influence was nonexistent, not only because he died in virtual oblivion in New York City in 1946 but because of a natural reticence on the part of the man himself.) While the modern skyscraper designed by Bauhaus-inspired architects dominated the urban American landscape, and the New York School of abstract expressionism came to prominence-first in the gallery world Can the Arts Survive?</page><page sequence="15">December 1984 331 of the visual arts, later in the museum and corporate worlds-most American poets, novelists, composers, painters, sculptors, and architects took to the university. By doing so-usually for reasons of professional convenience and economic survival-they removed themselves from so- ciety-at-large and set up an invisible wall between themselves and their work and the culture that went on outside academia. When modernism went academic in America and divorced itself from society, it lost all capacity to respond or relate to the world around it, to the pressing needs of a culture which became increasingly empty, bland, and insensitive to the hungers of the human spirit. By sheltering itself in intellectuality, in abstractness, in cold design, it lost its power to interest or move listeners, viewers, readers. While it is true that not all composers, painters, and so forth took refuge in the university, even among those who free-lanced, the spirit of modernism had grown cold and desiccated. With the general loss of criteria in language and the inflation of partis.an critical support in magazines, journals, and newspapers, slipshod work, too often sub- stituted for craftsmanship, and charlatanism began to substitute for genuine artistic imagination and vision. In the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, when America went through its own severe internal crisis brought on by the Vietnam War and Americans were wracked by serious qualms and doubts about their own society and its values, modernism lay on its deathbed, played out, invalidated by its own products. The mythic Iron Age had entered the heart of modernism and corroded it. We are now, according to the literary and art critics, in a postmodern period. However, I reject the term "postmodernism" as appropriate to what is happening today in our culture. Obviously, the term states clearly that we are past modernism in the purely temporal sense. Having reacted strongly to modernism's rejection of the past-to tradition and history- painters, architects, composers, and thinkers are now in the process of renegotiating a pact with modernism's rejects. In the process of regaining lost ground, pluralism has emerged as the principal characteristic of the postmodern ethos. There is no common language, and everyone is off on his own trying to solve his problem as best he can. While pluralism is considered a healthy sign by most, the fact that the problems created by modernism remain to be resolved in a profounder way than pluralism allows seems to have escaped those who see postmodernism as the way to put culture and the arts back on their feet. My reasons for rejecting the term "postmodernism" are simple enough. While I acknowledge the purely temporal sense in which the term is used, it is hardly that fact alone which is sufficient for acquiescing to a term in which the word "modernism" remains embedded and which is intended, I suppose, to describe, refer to, indicate those collective efforts already set in motion which are attempting to create a new and more balanced culture, one which must base itself again on the past and its relation to the present and the recognition of the validity of continuity. Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="16">332 George Rochberg In this sense, it would be better to invent a new term, and if one does not come to mind quickly or easily, it would be just as well to get along without a label while we get on with the main business at hand. But I have still stronger reasons for rejecting a term which incorporates "mod- ernism" in it. The continued presence of "modernism" would be a constant reminder of the sickness of spirit which the modern movement engendered, of the loss of values it brought on, of the imbalances it caused-the very things we are struggling to overcome by our thoughts, our acts, our work. (One need only remind oneself of the dire prophecy of Hermann Hesse's Magister Ludi or Doris Lessing's Shikasta to realize how crucial it is not to slide, unthinking, into the use of terms which somehow keep alive the memory of states of consciousness which turned out to be thoroughly inimical and antithetic to man and his purposes and goals.) If rejecting what "modernism" has come to stand for also means taking a severely critical view of the twentieth century itself, then, for the sake of the work that lies ahead, we must indeed have the courage to question any referential tag which fails to identify the spirit of the enterprise we are now engaged in. Where music is concerned, the whole question of language is the pressing issue. Music, which is the art least rooted in the externals of the natural world and which issues directly from man's central nervous system, is in a state of linguistic chaos. The much-vaunted pluralism of our present musical culture is a direct result of the loss of a communicable language; and such a loss is the fallout and heritage of either a free or ordered atonality or both. Much of what still goes by the name of "music" is either simply sound-generation or soul-less complexity or mindless minimalism. The cracks between are too often filled by nondescript prod- ucts of unimaginative minds. The majority of composers whose work falls into these generalized types are comfortable with the idea of pluralism mainly because pluralism, as an umbrella term, tacitly sanctions a cultural Tower of Babel and permits a situation where value, criteria, and judgment can have no common critical base-hence the absence of critical means by which to evaluate quality, substance, and meaning from an artistic point of view. Perhaps the festival of new music dubbed "Horizons '83: A New Romanticism?" which the New York Philharmonic sponsored in June 1983, holds a promise of better things to come. Unquestionably, composers are turning from the old abstractionist tendencies of modernism to new forms of expressivity, many of which are couched in simpler language, are less complex-at least on the surface-and, therefore, seem more immediately accessible. Tonal means have reemerged as part of the palette of musical thinking of these composers, but whether all this presages a genuinely new Romantic spirit remains a moot point. It will take a con- siderable body of convincing works to convert the question mark of the festival title to a clear and simple statement of fact. But even to have put Can the Arts Survive?</page><page sequence="17">Critical Inquiry December 1984 the question in a public context at this juncture has more than common significance. 3. What Is the Legacy of Modernism in the Arts and in Society in General? Let me tackle this crucial question from an oblique angle by citing part of an interview Milan Kundera, the Czech writer, persona non grata in his own country and now living in Paris, had with Francine du Plessix Gray: FRANCINE DU PLESSIX GRAY: You seem to imply that one of the most tragic features of our times-on both sides of the Iron Curtain- is our tendency towards personal and cultural amnesia. Is this cycle of forgetting a result of political forces, or technological ones? MILAN KUNDERA: Definitely technological. I see it as a human condition whose causes are deeper and more complex than those of any communist or capitalist ideology, and which depends to a great extent on the conditions of the post-industrial age. TV, the media, technology in general are the major instruments of forgetting. One must remember that the technological age represents an ex- tremely advanced stage of our civilization. Our civilization is very, very old and this mass of time passed is becoming a problem for us. How can we retain the past, remember it, understand it all? Yet the greatest evil confronting us daily is the forgetting of past values, it's in great part the cause of that dehumanization whose beginnings Kafka perceived. When people begin to forget their past, they begin to lose the best part of themselves. Paradoxically, in the mass of information that the technological age brings, memory is lost at even greater rapidity. We're bombarded by too much banal infor- mation that totally fails to remind us of our past.'3 Kundera says in his remarkable book The Book of Laughter and Forgetting: "The struggle of man against power is a struggle of memory against forgetting." The context in which this powerful sentence occurs is one in which the combined forces of capitalism and totalitarianism and ac- cumulating technological pressures are robbing human beings of their ability to remember their own past. To live without memory is to be reduced to a sensory automaton, a flesh-and-blood box of nerve endings which merely respond, pleasurably or not, to each sensation experienced. The accumulation of the memories of life and its sum of experience do not automatically confer meaning on life. It is, however, the only im- mediately lived basis human beings have for creating a sense of individual 333</page><page sequence="18">334 George Rochberg Can the Arts Survive? and collective meaning. Robbed of that basis, life indeed attains a condition of robotic mindlessness. Culture is more than the piling up of individual works, just as an individual life is more than the piling up of discrete sensations and experiences. It is memory in the form of tradition which is the bloodstream of culture; and tradition is a form of subtle ways of remembering which emerge from using a collective language individually, linking one's work to the past because one cherishes the values of the past, however remote or recent. This thread of collective remembering creates a spiritual bond to what has gone before (that is worth remembering) and ensures some possible connection with an, as yet, unforeseen future which, one hopes, will also want to remember-and, in its turn, to be remembered. One should not be surprised if the "forgetting" Kundera speaks of is characteristically built into twentieth-century music, especially that of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Where "forgetting" is not present, it is because the composer, for example, a Bart6k or a Berg, has composed not according to the traditions of the music of the past but by remembering those traditions. What kind of music has built "forgetting" into its very fabric?: music without any perceptibly clear motivic or melodic shapes; music without perceptible harmonic syntax or metric/rhythmic syntax; music of designed and generalized textures and colors; music without a clear emotional scenario or with no emotional scenario at all. Because music is precisely a temporal art, it loses meaning in exact ratio to the degree of "forgetting" built into it. At best, such music can be only an ordered (or not) collection of events, sound sensations which have no memorable relationships to what has come before or what will follow- although its composer could, probably, demonstrate by analysis of one kind or another that the relationships do, in fact, exist on the page. But what if they do not and cannot exist in the ear? This is precisely where the process of "forgetting" begins, and no amount of intellectual explanation or rationalization can make the ear do what, in fact, it does best: remember. The ear is one of the chief instruments of memory. Where music is concerned, one could go so far as to say the ear wants to remember; that is its natural function. But when it is listening with intense attention to something that cannot be remembered, no matter how hard it tries, the ear withdraws in exasperated weariness and frustration. Music is the principal art man has in which the natural function of memory becomes translated, through sound, into recognizable, perceptible, emotional forms. What we call the "repertoire" is the repository of man's memory of his desire to remember a centuries-long body of just such recognizable, perceptible, emotional forms which he naturally and consciously identifies with meaning-however difficult it may be to define and pin down that meaning. Without engaging in a technical discussion of the function of memory in music, it is nevertheless possible to point out that virtually all traditional</page><page sequence="19">Critical Inquiry December 1984 devices for producing identity and organic structure in a given work rest solidly and firmly on the human capacity for remembering the shape (or profile) of melodic ideas and their associated harmonies (as well as polyphonic enrichments where they occur) regardless of the many trans- formations these ideas may be subjected to. The uses of recall (exact or varied repetition), variation, and development are linked directly to the ear's ability to remember specific musical shapes, gestures, and what musicians call "klangs," that is, sound icons. There is inevitably an iso- morphic relationship between what I am calling "identity" and how that identity has been literally built into a composition. Even granting flawed work (not all great or even good pieces of music are perfect in their structure), identity is the direct perceptual clue to the presence of organic structure and, when traced out, reveals with absolute clarity the presence of a memory function in the whole. One can go further and suggest that musical ideas of the kind I have been describing in a general way possess a form of self-reflexiveness. That is, while a piece of music cannot remember itself as a human being can (and does), without imposing a doubtful anthropomorphism, one can "read" the memory devices in music as direct translations into sound of those forms of human self-consciousness which are self-reflexive in nature and which derive from our innate memory capacity. Having virtually been stripped of the natural power of memory, of communicable language in the arts, of meaning in life, and having thrown all questions of morality and ethics into limbo, how are we to regain our balance and in the process repair the extensive damage done by mod- ernism? The enterprise I have in mind requires the rebuilding of all the languages of civilized and cultured consciousness which suffered the reductionist, abstractionist, minimalist tendencies of modernism. It requires the rebuilding of a memory of the past once again active in the present. It requires the search for new balances among the many dichotomies with which the modernist movement littered its path through the last eighty years. The balances I have in mind are balances of enormous tension which will not be easy to establish, in the first place, or maintain, in the second, mostly because they will demand an energy of mind and heart which were lost a long time ago but which must, nevertheless, be regained. Part of this process necessitates a total reevaluation and critical estimate of the sources of modernism and its course leading to the decline and decay of language-precisely what I have been trying to do in this essay. Anton Webern sought, in his late works, to discover how it might be possible to combine what he considered to be natural laws of tonality with the invention of the twelve tones freed of any hierarchic relation to each other. This is the first hint-as far back as the 1940s-that a balance could be struck between a hierarchic language of relationships with its multiple and multivalent levels and a nonhierarchic syntax where 335</page><page sequence="20">336 George Rochberg Can the Arts Survive? relationships were governed by a single idea or law. Now we are once again involved in picking up this thread; for there is no question in my mind that, while atonality is not a language per se (Claude Levi-Strauss argues this point brilliantly in his preface to The Raw and the Cooked) but chiefly a syntax, it remains a legitimate extension of pitch possibilities in Western music and must now be incorporated into a larger, more extended language of tonality. The balance struck between these two, the old past and recent past (deriving from modernism), is one of the chief concerns of the composer today. But other balances must be struck, for example, between the gestures of the old music and the gestures of the new. The explorations of those pathological states of consciousness so characteristic of the best modern music are part of what twentieth-century man has discovered about himself, however disturbing they may be. These spiritual dissonances are no less important for having emerged from the modern experience. But they must be balanced off against the spiritual consonances of repose, of awe, of exuberance, ofjoy-no less a part of man's universal experience. The enlargement of the emotional palette of music, by bringing into balance again the two sides of man's nature, is the only way to resolve the present dichotomy and imbalance between them-the spiritual con- sonances which modernism relegated to the past and the spiritual dis- sonances which modernism justified because they mirrored best, man's "true," contemporary condition, his angst, his anomie, his off-centeredness. This aesthetic agenda requires composers who know the musical past thoroughly, who believe and live in its transhistorical values as still contemporary with themselves. It also requires composers who have ex- perienced the twentieth century intensely and can thread their way care- fully, choosing those devices and syntaxes which can be incorporated into a still larger language than they permit by themselves, thus restoring and extending the language of music. Beyond all these difficult Herculean tasks I pose for composers-including myself-lies the one absolute task: to compose a music which, because its structure is clear and directly immediate to the ear, its shapes are indelible, as perfect in their delineation as humanly possible, its emotional scenario is rich, humanly felt-humanly perceivable, can be remembered. Such a music would indeed be the symbol of the new balance. As far back as history and myth record, there has always been a metaphysical gap between individual human consciousness and cosmos. Put another way, the sense of being human, that is, incomplete, has always been accompanied by an intensely felt sense of a void between the uncertainties of human self-awareness and what man has always looked upon as a mysteriously unfathomable and stolidly uncaring universe. Where myth is concerned, I am thinking of Tantalus, Antaeus, Sisyphus, and of Daedalus and Icarus in Greek lore, and of Arjuna and Krishna in the Bhagavadgita. Nowhere in recorded history is the metaphysical gap more painfully exemplified than in the strange story of the Gnostics</page><page sequence="21">December 1984 337 (during the Hellenistic period) and their longing to bridge the gap from what they conceived as an alien, earthly existence to what they firmly believed were their heavenly origins in a God totally unlike the Judaic Jehovah or the early church's conception of Christ as God. This gap- or void-has been the primary source and cause of human uncertainty and, equally, the goad to the civilizing process of socialization and culture. Traditionally, before God was declared dead, God or the gods filled it. More recently, it was filled by the answers science gave us which have, for many, turned out to be doubtful or nonanswers. Always it has been filled by art. Modernism tried to claim victory over the metaphysical gap, to declare it nonexistent, having overcome the weight of memory, history, the past, tradition. But this claim boomeranged. After eighty years, we see that what modernism actually did was to dismantle and destroy whatever bridges had been previously thrown across the gap and left an even wider and deeper void than ever before-and, now, filled with violence and terror and the dread of annihilation. Hard as the prospect may be, we have no recourse but to make full acknowledgment of our plight and begin building new bridges across the gap. A major part of this process, underscored by a keen and new awareness of our situation, is to build anew the languages of art and human consciousness. The polarities of the past and the present, man and nature, of human perceptions and a still mysterious, opaque universe, and of mind and body must be balanced in a new tension of supreme self-consciousness which transcends the individual ego without destroying it. 4. We Have Come Full Circle, Back to the Question with Which We Started: Can the Arts Survive Modernism? Since an answer based on cheap and easy optimism or one which rests on pure equivocation, that is, a highly qualified "yes" or an equally highly qualified "no," is not to my taste, I will try to answer in a way which I believe is consistent with the reality of the situation. Whether we call the era we are in now "postmodernism," "postin- dustrialism," or something else, we are still, nonetheless, subject to the eviscerating legacy of modernism in every area of human endeavor. This is further and endlessly complicated by the contending ideologies of East and West and the threat of nuclear world holocaust that this deadly confrontation poses. If we add to this somber picture the frictions taking place on every continent on this planet-whether racial, economic, or political-or all together at the same time, we begin to understand some- thing of the scope of the problem a restitution of the arts faces. Even if we assume time is on our side, there is still the question of whether we Critical Inquiry</page><page sequence="22">338 George Rochberg can collectively initiate and carry through to mature realization the complete configuration of a new world view which rests on a base of wisdom yet to be attained, a wisdom which informs our thoughts and acts in the private and public spheres. For only a complete shift in world view can provide the values, conditions, and ambience in which the arts can once again flourish-not that the arts are totally dependent on the establishment of these values and conditions. In the twentieth century alone there have been at least two instances in which the arts have acted as the antennae of civilization, putting out signals and feelers-sensing what lay directly ahead. The first of these happened just before World War I when, around 1909-12, atonality and expressionism captured and gave voice to a sense of sickness and decay, of impending doom and chaos. The second instance occurred in the 1920s when extreme forms of rationalization entered music through serialism, and architecture and design through the Bauhaus. These efforts to impose a rationalized aesthetic were pre-echoes of what was to follow: Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Spain, Communist Russia-all rationalized totalitarian states, single-idea political and social entities. The hope, now, is the growing demand to reclaim the past, to bring into existence by an intense exercise of will and self-consciousness languages which embrace the traditions of the premodern and modern periods. To bring into balance again the polarities of heart and mind, or what lies within and what lies without in the experience of man, is a sign that, once again, the arts may be pointing the way to a time when these qualities and characteristics will, perhaps, again appear as new values on the visible plane of a new social, economic, racial, and political order. The shape of the future is always unpredictable. It is clear that modern technology and scientific knowledge have outstripped man's capacity for wisdom. We not only need more time in which to master what we have learned about the physical facts of the world; we need more time to grow into wisdom, a new sense of human values, of morality and ethical behavior among men everywhere. While there is still time, it is imperative that we think less of economic and political power and more of how to live, listening more to the dictates of the heart than those of the mind without ignoring the latter. Our thinkers, doers, and artists must concern themselves with bridging the metaphysical gap in better and more satisfying ways. The barren inner landscape produced by the experience of modernism must be replaced by forms of thought, action, and art which are alive again with meaning, forms which speak to man in ways which revitalize him. The polarities which modernism turned into dichotomies must be brought into a new balance of tension which is alive with new and significant possibilities. Should some of what is accomplished remind us of more ancient ways, that should not distress us. The surviving values of the ancients which have lasted into our own day have a great deal to tell us about human reality and human truths. Can the Arts Survive?</page><page sequence="23">December 1984 339 Those values must form the core and base of whatever wisdom we are capable of regaining and extending. Let me conclude by quoting a passage from the essay "Modern Idolatry" by Owen Barfield: The antidote to wrongs done in the past is restitution. But the only antidote tofeelings of guilt, whether individual or collective, is re- pentance. It is (again) Paul Ricoeur who reminds us that in the Old Testament there is no abstract word for repentance, only the symbol of "returning." And it is such a returning to the source from which we have cut ourselves off-or, in an older idiom, from which we have "fallen"-that I believe is needed. Not of course a literal returning to the past by way of H. G. Wells' time-machine, but a return by re-experiencing the past in the present. It is in the present we live, and it is our present condition, the very isolation and detachment of our self-consciousness, that has for the first time rendered possible that contemplation of the past and its re-enactment in imagination that is called "history." Without that, it is not only the world of our perceptions, the world of nature, from which each of us grows more isolated, but also from each other. For it is in the deepest realm of the unconscious that men really are one. It is there we must look both for our source and our goal, and we can only approach nearer to our goal by remembering our source. If literalness is our collective sin, history is our collective memory. Or we can make it so. And if it is ety- mologically no more than a pun, it is nevertheless a profound truth that it is only by remembering our source that we can hope to "remember" our true selves in a truly human community, instead of building up all manner of defenses and strategies to defend our empty artificial selves by fortifying them in their isolation.14 1.
