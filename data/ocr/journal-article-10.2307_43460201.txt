<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COLOR OF INFLUENCE: A PROVENANCE STUDY OF HEMATITE-BASED PAINTS ON EARLY OLMEC CARVED POTTERY Claras J. Backes, Jr., David Cheetham, and Hector Neff Recent research and debates regarding the origin and spread of Olmec iconography during the Early Formative have cen- tered on provenance and stylistic analyses of carved and incised pottery. Studies by instrumental neutron activation analy- sis (INAA) have indicated that Gulf Coast-style carved-incised pots were exported extensively from the area of the first Olmec capital, San Lorenzo , to several other regions of Me soame rica. More recently, excavations at the Pacific Coast site of Cantón Corralito have shown that carved-incised pottery and other Olmec-style artifacts dominate strata contemporary with Early Olmec, suggesting the site may represent a settlement enclave of Gulf Olmec peoples. In this study we provide additional evidence of exchange between the Gulf Olmec and the Pacific Coast region by using laser ablation time-of-flight inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-TOF-ICP-MS) to characterize hematite -based paints on Olmec-style pottery from Cantón Corralito, and to compare these paints to raw hematite recovered from Cantón Corralito and San Lorenzo. When examined in combination with sherd provenance data, the LA-TOF-ICP-MS data demonstrate that Olmec vessels were decorated in the San Lorenzo region before being exported to the Pacific Coast, and that Gulf Coast hematite was exported to Cantón Corralito, where it was used to enhance Olmec-style symbolism on locally produced vessels. Recientes investigaciones y debates sobre el origen y la extensión de la iconografía olmeca durante el Formativo Temprano se han centrado en los análisis estilísticos y de procedencia de la cerámica tallada y cincelada. Estudios utilizando análisis de activación de neutrones (INAA) han indicado que vasijas talladas-cinceladas en el estilo de la Costa del Golfo fueron expor- tadas extensivamente desde el área de la primera capital olmeca de San Lorenzo a otras regiones de Mesoamérica. Reciente- mente, excavaciones en el sitio de Cantón Corralito, ubicado en la costa del Pacífico, han mostrado que la cerámica tallada-cincelada y otros artefactos de estilo olmeca dominan los estratos contemporáneos con o olmeca temprano, lo que sugiere que el sitio puede representar un posible asentamiento de una población olmeca del Golfo. En este estudio, presenta- mos evidencia adicional acerca del intercambio entre los olmecas del Golfo y la región de la costa del Pacífico, usando espec- troscopia de masas acoplada inductivamente con ablación laser de tiempo de vuelo (Laser Ablation Time-Of -Flight Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry - LA-TOF-ICP-MS ), para caracterizar colorantes a base de hematita en la ceràmica de estilo olmeca de Cantón Corralito, y para comparar estos colorantes con hematita sin procesar recuperada de Cantón Co- rralito y San Lorenzo. Cuando los datos de LA-TOF-ICP-MS son examinados junto con información de procedencia de los fragmentos, demuestran que las vasijas olmecas fueron decoradas en la región de San Lorenzo antes de ser exportadas a la costa del Pacífico, y que la hematita de la costa del Golfo fue exportada a Cantón Corralito, donde se usó para acentuar el simbolismo de estilo olmeca en los recipientes localmente producidos. Blomster, old analysis debates Neff, of Early regarding and Olmec Glascock's Formative pottery (2005) rekindled period recent analysis of Early Olmec pottery rekindled old debates regarding Formative period interregional interaction in Mesoamerica. Using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) to compare raw clay sources to the paste constituents of archaeological ceramics from across Mesoamer- ica, they found evidence that trade in Olmec-style pottery was unidirectional. Their data showed that carved and incised pots were exported from the region of the first Olmec capital, San Lorenzo, to numerous areas outside the Gulf Olmec heartland, yet they saw no evidence of corresponding import of pottery from those areas into the San Lorenzo region. Their findings were challenged by Stoltman et al. (2005) on the basis of flawed sample selec- Clarus J. Backes, Jr. ■ Sapphos Environmental, Inc., 430 N.

Blomster et al.'s (2005) claims are controversial because they have direct implications for ongoing debates regarding the importance of the Olmec in the development of complex society in Mesoamer- ica. The symbolism present on these pots arguably represents the first widespread artistic style and ideology known for Mesoamerica, eventually appearing on ceramics, portable art objects, and monumental art throughout the region (DiCastro and Cyphers 2006:33). Blomster et al. (2005: 1068) contend that "because this iconography has been linked with the dissemination of the social, politi- cal, and religious institutions of the Olmec, ana- lyzing its origin and spread is central to understanding the development of complex soci- ety in Mesoamerica." But while questioning the INAA study, Flannery et al. (2005) maintained that no such link has ever been demonstrated, and argued that the motifs seen in Olmec carved and incised pottery were so widespread during the early Formative that it is impossible to trace their origin to a single ethnic group or to associate them with a specific set of institutions. Another, more recent study has uncovered addi- tional evidence related to the export of Olmec-style pottery and its associated iconography from the San Lorenzo area. During his excavations of Can- ton Corralito, an Early Formative (c. 1600-1000 B.C.1) site near the Pacific coast in the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Cheetham found that strata con- temporary with Early Olmec were dominated by Gulf Coast-style carved and incised pottery, clay figurines, and other Olmec-style artifacts, and that these ceramics are stylistically and technically equivalent to ceramics recovered from contempo- raneous San Lorenzo (Cheetham 2006a, 2009, 2010a, 2010b; see also DiCastro and Cyphers [2009] for a discussion of common ceramic motifs from San Lorenzo contexts). Furthermore, INAA analysis of the clay pastes comprising these ceram- ics showed that many of these vessels had their ori- gins in the San Lorenzo area. These findings have led Cheetham (2010b) to conclude that Canton Corralito functioned as an Olmec colony, perhaps facilitating trade between the Olmec heartland and the Pacific Coast. In this paper we describe our efforts to chemi- cally characterize hematite, the mineral form of iron oxide (Fe203), in order to provide additional evi- dence of exchange between the Gulf Olmec and the Pacific Coast region and to examine the role that hematite played in the spread of Olmec-style iconography during the Early Formative. Indeed, a link clearly exists between hematite and early Olmec symbolism, although that link is currently poorly understood. During their excavations at San Lorenzo, Coe and Diehl (1980:166) noted that sherds showing Olmec-style carved and incised motifs often had hematite rubbed into their excised areas after firing, and many of the San Lorenzo-style incised and carved ceramics recovered from Can- ton Corralito retain traces of their hematite-based paint (Cheetham 20 1 0a). Fragments of raw hematite have also been recovered from archaeological con- texts in both Canton Corralito and San Lorenzo. This study uses laser ablation time-of-flight inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (TOF-LA-ICP- MS) analysis in combination with recently acquired INAA data to determine whether hematite was (1) applied to Gulf Coast vessels before export to Can- ton Corralito, (2) imported to Canton Corralito in raw form and applied to locally produced vessels, or (3) quarried in the Canton Corralito region and applied to either imported or locally produced vessels - in short, how hematite was used on Olmec-style ceramics, and how the origins of hematite vary among local and imported pottery found in this Pacific Coast site. The appearance of chemically identical raw pig- ments in both San Lorenzo and Canton Corralito could be taken as evidence of Gulf Olmec trade, although it would require a correlation between a geologic hematite sample and a pigment recovered from an archaeological context to determine the place of origin or direction of transport. Several hematite outcrops that may have been exploited prehistorically occur in the Gulf Coast region (Coe and Diehl 1980: 16; Ortiz and Rodriguez 2000), but</page><page sequence="3">72 L ATI N AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1 , 201 2 so far no sources showing evidence of prehistoric use have been documented in southeastern coastal Chiapas. This suggests that pigments found in Can- ton Corralito, whether raw or used as the main ingredient in paints that decorate Olmec-style pot- tery, may have originated in the San Lorenzo area. This notion will be supported if the hematites on Olmec-style Canton Corralito pottery are found to match raw pigments from the San Lorenzo region. However, if some or all of the paint on the Olmec- style pottery shows compositional similarity with raw pigment found at Canton Corralito, and this pigment is distinct from raw pigments from San Lorenzo, then the nature of the pottery trade may be more complex than previously thought: Olmec- style vessels, including those manufactured at Can- ton Corralito and those exported to Canton Corralito from the Gulf Coast, may have been dec- orated with hematite derived from sources outside the San Lorenzo area. Hematite Hematite is rarely found in a pure form archaeo- logically. The pigment generally found in archae- ological contexts and used prehistorically as a coloring agent is red ocher, which consists of hematite mixed with other minerals. Because nat- urally occurring iron oxide pigments are found in a wide variety of geologic settings, typical Fe203 content of ocher can range from approximately 20 percent to 85 percent, depending on the source (Fuller 1988:Table 1). The remaining portion of ocher is made up of silicates and clays that act as diluents to the hematite, as well as minor and trace elements which may give the hematite a charac- teristic chemical pattern. Despite the tendency for this widely variable range of accompanying min- erals to introduce "noise" that may obscure its com- positional profile, hematite is well suited for provenance analysis. Recent studies (e.g., Erland- son et al. 1999; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2007) demon- strate that the composition of raw hematite shows the kind of variation described by Weigand et al.'s (1977:24) "Provenience Postulate," which states the identification of a mineral source location is possible if "there exist differences in chemical com- position between different natural sources that exceed, in some recognizable way, the differences observed within a given source." Although it is a common component of soils and sediments, hematite often occurs on the landscape in discrete outcrops, or sources. As with obsidian and other raw materials, hematite from specific sources may have been regularly utilized and traded. In addition, paints containing hematite as their main ingredient are known to have been prepared and applied according to specific recipes (Clottes 1993; Fiore et al. 2008; Goodall et al. 2009; Görden 1996). Given these assumptions, chemical characteriza- tion of hematite-based paints has the potential to provide important indications of trade, cultural transmission of technology, and other types of inter- regional interaction. The Gulf Olmec made extensive use of hematite-based paint to decorate their ceramics, architecture, and portable art objects (DiCastro and Cyphers 2099:33; Pool 2007:103), and it is likely that the majority of carved and incised ves- sels produced during the San Lorenzo phase had hematite rubbed into their carved areas after fir- ing (Cheetham 2006b; Coe and Diehl 1980:166; DiCastro and Cyphers 2009:33). Because hematite is common in the Cenozoic sediments and salt domes of the Gulf Coast region (Martínez-Hernán- dez et al. 2005), we believe it is reasonable to assume that most, if not all, of the hematite used by the Gulf Olmec was locally mined. Coe and Diehl (1980:16) describe several prehistorically exploited hematite sources in the San Lorenzo area, including red beds and outcrops near Alma- gres northwest of San Lorenzo, at El Palotal to the southwest of Almagres, at San Antonio, located between Almagres and the Rio Tatagapa, and on the Cerro Colorado and the Cerro de la Encantada, both southwest of San Lorenzo. The iron content of hematite, limonite, and speculante from these sources averages about 30 percent, and in some cases is as high as 50 percent (Coe and Diehl 1980:16). Hematite was also readily available from out- crops atop the El Manatí hill, located in the Coatza- coalcos River Basin approximately 10 km east of San Lorenzo. The site of El Manatí consists of a small hill rising from the swampy terrain, with a natural spring at its base where recent excavations provide evidence of extensive Early Olmec era rit- ual: artifacts recovered from the mud deposits at El Manatí include ceramics, jade axes, beads, rubber balls, anthropomorphic wood busts, and burials</page><page sequence="4">Backes et al.] THE COLOR OF INFLUENCE 73 (Ortiz and Rodríguez 2000). Ortiz and Rodríguez (1999:250) describe El Manatí as a source of red pigment for the surrounding communities. They believe that the El Manatí hematite symbolized blood and was an important resource for local and regional exchange. In contrast, there are no known prehistorically exploited sources of hematite in the coastal plain of the Soconusco region, although hematite is known to occur in Chiapas. Red beds corre- sponding to the Todos Santos Formation are exposed in a long, narrow band bordering the northeastern edge of the Chiapas massif (Mene- ses-Rocha 2001:192), but these deposits are located in the highlands approximately 250 km north of Cantón Corralito. Additionally, a 1923 report published by the Geological Institute of Mexico (Salinas 1923:215) briefly refers to a his- torical hematite mine located in the Acacoyahua municipality of Chiapas, approximately 60 km northwest of Canton Corralito. However, the report does not provide any information about the mine other than its name, Mina El Porvenir, so it is unclear whether hematite outcropped in that area or was reached through excavation. Beaudry (1989) reviewed site reports and ceramic collections to investigate the use of spec- ular hematite pigment along the Pacific Coast of Chiapas and Guatemala from the Early Formative through the Late Postclassic. Specular hematite is rarely seen on Pacific Coast vessels until the Mid- dle and Late Classic periods, when it appears on several different types of ceramics (e.g., Patulul and Tiquisate) that were widely distributed through- out the region (Beaudry 1989:206). Although Beaudry describes occurrences of specular hematite paint on Early Formative Barra and Ocós phase pottery from Pacific Coastal Chiapas, Clark and Cheetham (2005) argued that these vessels were actually decorated with a thin slip of levigated red clay; although the clay probably received its color through an iron oxide component, they deter- mined that the slip was made specular by the addi- tion of mica prior to firing. Whether or not specular hematite was used during the Barra, Locona, and Ocós phases, Beaudry is correct in her argument that the alluvial nature of the Pacific coastal plain made the natural occurrence of specular hematite unlikely, and therefore the appearance of this pig- ment on any ceramics found in the region is an indi- cation that either the pigment or the ceramics them- selves were imported. Although all of the paints analyzed in the present study are composed of the non-specular variety of hematite, we assume that it was as scarce as the specular variety along the Pacific Coast during the Early Formative, and also came to the region through exchange. In Situ Paint Characterization While several recent studies have succeeded in chemically characterizing raw or geological hematites (e.g., Erlandson et al. 1999; Iriarte et al. 2009; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2007; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2008), in situ provenance analysis of hematite on ceramics and other artifacts poses a unique set of challenges. Foremost of these is the need to dis- tinguish the compositional patterns associated with the hematite under study from those of surround- ing materials, whether they were introduced natu- rally or added during the paint manufacturing process. As mentioned above, iron oxide in geo- logic settings is almost always diluted to some degree by clays or other surrounding minerals. Fur- thermore, prehistoric paints designed to provide permanent decoration of fired pottery, stone, bone, wood, and other materials were often composed of a number of components in addition to the pigment itself. These could include a binder, consisting of clay or an organic material such as vegetable oil, animal fat, blood, or egg yolk, which acted as a fix- ative to hold the color to the painted surface; and a vehicle, either water or another fluid element in the paint that allowed it to be handled and applied eas- ily (Chalmin et al. 2003; Clottes 1993; Görden 1996). It is almost certain that these kinds of addi- tives are components of the paints analyzed in this study. During exploratory analyses involving the application of raw hematite to ceramic test tiles, we found that hematite alone adheres poorly to fired clay, and must be combined with a binder and vehi- cle if is to remain in place for any period of time. Therefore any study, including this one, that seeks to use patterning of major, minor, and trace element concentrations to discriminate hematite sources must consider the presence of surrounding miner- als not associated with the iron oxide as well as materials introduced during paint preparation. Chemical analysis of paint on potsherds, par- ticularly those excavated from acidic soils, is also</page><page sequence="5">74 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1, 2012 made difficult by the fact that paint may have weathered to the point where it remains only as a thin film on the surface of the sherd, or as minute amounts trapped in cracks or depressions in a ves- sel's surface. This is often the case with sherds that have been painted after firing, such as the carved and incised sherds recovered from both San Lorenzo and Canton Corralito. Paints that have been applied after firing are generally more chal- lenging to analyze than paints applied prior to fir- ing. Heat bonds the paint firmly to the vessel's surface, and may cause hardening through sinter- ing if the hematite is mixed with clay, but post-fire paints are held to the ceramic only by the binder and therefore tend to be relatively friable and prone to deterioration. This is especially evident in San Lorenzo phase ceramics, which are often so eroded that even the slightest trace of paint is absent. For- tunately the pottery at Canton Corralito has fared somewhat better in the less-acidic soil of the Pacific Coast, and several specimens were recovered that retained enough paint for analysis. Nevertheless, the surficial and often fugitive nature of post-fire paints precludes the use of bulk characterization techniques such as INAA (instrumental neutron activation analysis), and necessitates the use of a microprobe technique, such as energy-dispersive and wavelength-dispersive spectrometers on a scan- ning electron microscope, or mass spectrometry coupled with laser sampling, for analysis of paint independent of the underlying ceramic. Archaeological Background The Mazatán region is a mosaic of forests, swamps, and coastal vegetation located along the Pacific coast of Chiapas, approximately 300 miles south of the Olmec heartland (Figure 1). Throughout the Initial Early Formative period the Mazatán zone was inhabited by the "Mokaya" a group, like the Olmecs, that is thought to have spoken an ances- tral Mixe-Zoquean language (Campbell and Kauf- man 1976; Clark and Blake 1989; Pool 2007: 183). The Mokaya created some of Mesoamerica's ear- liest ceramics, which appear during the Barra phase (1600-1425 B.C.) and are notable for their high quality of manufacture and elaborate decoration (Blake et al. 1995:167). During the subsequent Locona phase (1425-1350 B.C.) the earliest rank society known in Mesoamerica appeared in the Mazatán area, along with formal ceremonial archi- tecture (Pool 2007:186). During this period local populations appear to have become organized into an interlocked network of simple chiefdoms, each based in a central village holding at least one elite residence on an elevated platform. The largest of these villages appears to have been Paso de la Amada, which contained an 80-meter long ball- court, the earliest known in Mesoamerica (Clark and Pye 2000:23 1 ; Hill et al. 1998). The Ocós phase (1350-1250 B.C.) saw the refinement of a two- tiered settlement hierarchy as populations contin- ued to aggregate into large villages (Blake et al. 1995:173; Clark and Pye 2000:232). The Cherla phase (1250 - 1 150 B.C.) marks the beginning of Gulf Olmec influence in the Mazatán region. Probably not coincidentally, changes in arti- fact distribution and architecture at Paso de la Amada provide evidence of increasing economic inequality triggered by "a new ideological synthe- sis [that] effectively legitimized economic control by an emergent elite class" (Lesure and Blake 2002:20). Clear evidence of significant trade con- tacts between the Gulf Coast and Mazatán regions can be seen: imports from the Gulf Coast include fine-paste ceramic vessels and clay figurines (Cheetham 2010b), while exotic goods from Guatemala, including obsidian from the highlands and jade from the Motagua Valley, apparently passed through Mazatán on the way back to the Gulf. Clark and Pye (2000:234) hypothesize that Mazatán began to export cacao during this period, and cacao residues have been detected on slightly earlier vessels from both El Manatí and Paso de la Amada (Powis et al. 2008). The Mokaya made copies of black-and-white Olmec style pottery locally, but with the imports generally distinguish- able by their relatively thin wall thickness and finer, ash-tempered paste. Chemical analysis indicates that significant quantities of these pots were imported from San Lorenzo during the Cherla phase (see Cheetham 2010b). The Cuadros phase corresponds with the peak of Early Olmec influence on the Pacific Coast, and is visible in the archaeological record as "a nearly full conversion of local artifacts to Olmec norms" (Clark and Pye 2000:234). The Cuadros phase saw the abandonment of Paso de la Amada and other key villages, and Clark (2007:21) has suggested that during this period independent chiefdoms in</page><page sequence="6">Backes et al.] THE COLOR OF INFLUENCE 75 Figure 1.

Located along the Coatán River in the Mazatan zone, Canton Corralito was initially occu- pied during the Late Archaic period (ca. 2300-1600 B.C.). At its peak during the Cuadros phase, Can- ton Corralito was at least 25 ha in size and had a population of perhaps 750-1,000 persons. Cheetham has found that a marked increase in Early Olmec-style artifacts occurred during this period. His excavations in 2004 yielded over 5,000 Olmec- style items, including vessels, figurines, roller stamps, ceramic spatulas/spoons, and objects of</page><page sequence="7">76 L ATI N AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1 , 201 2 Figure 2.

The ceramic assemblage includes common utilitarian pottery as well as decorated types con- sidered diagnostic of the San Lorenzo phase (1 150-900 B.C.) at San Lorenzo; in all, over 1,000 Calzadas Carved sherds and over 3,700 Limón Incised sherds were found. Over 1,250 figurine fragments were also recovered, the majority of which are nearly identical to Olmec examples from the Gulf Coast (Cheetham 2009). The strong sim- ilarities between Olmec-style pottery from Canton Corralito and San Lorenzo, along with the clear transition from indigenous Mokaya assemblages to Olmec assemblages, have led Cheetham to suggest that Canton Corralito was colonized by the Gulf Olmec during the Cuadros phase (Cheetham 2006a, 2010a, 2010b). Ceramic I^pes Calzadas Carved (Figure 2) and Limón Incised (Figure 3) are the ceramic marker types defined by Coe and Diehl (1980) for the San Lorenzo phase, which corresponds to the period of greatest cultural elaboration at San Lorenzo. These types are also prevalent in Cuadros phase contexts at Canton Cor- ralito, where Cheetham (Cheetham 2010a) has found them to be indistinguishable from their San Lorenzo counterparts in terms of form, technical style of manufacture (i.e., metric parameters such as wall thickness, rim diameter, vessel height, and so on), and decoration. Both types are composed largely of bolstered or direct rim serving vessels that were slipped in black, white, or black-and- white, although some are unslipped. All have exte- rior designs that were carved before firing, when</page><page sequence="8">Backes et al.] THE COLOR OF INFLUENCE 77 Figure 3.

These carved and incised design elements, which include a number of distinctive abstract motifs that may represent supernatural creatures or parts of creatures, are hallmarks of Early Olmec iconogra- phy - Coe and Diehl ( 1 980: 1 59) describe Calzadas Carved as "100 percent Olmec, in the sense that it has been decorated with motifs and in a style long identified as Olmec." Although the surfaces of carved and incised vessels recovered from San Lorenzo were particularly eroded (Coe and Diehl 1980:162), it is apparent that the majority of ves- sels of this type from both coasts had hematite rubbed into their excised areas. Other Early Olmec ceramic types recovered from Canton Corralito and analyzed during the pre- sent study include Tatagapa Red and La Mina White. Tatagapa Red vessels have an exterior weakly slipped in red, and were incised through the slip or sometimes decorated with false rocker stamping before firing. La Mina White vessels were made of orange to tan paste and were thinly slipped in white, and were otherwise generally undeco- rated. La Mina White "paint dishes" often con- tained traces of hematite in their interiors, and may have been used to hold paint (Coe and Diehl 1980). Recent INAA analysis of clays from San Lorenzo-style carved and incised vessels, figurines, and other ceramics recovered from Canton Co- rralito has demonstrated that many of these artifacts originated in the Gulf Coast area, thus bolstering both Cheetham's (2006a, 2009, 2010a, 2010b; see also Pool 2007:192) hypothesis of Gulf Olmec colonialism and Blomster et al.'s (2005) assertions of one-way trade of ceramics out of San Lorenzo (Neff and Glascock 2007). For Cheetham's (20 1 0b)</page><page sequence="9">78 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1, 2012 study, the ceramic pastes of 565 Cherla and Cuadros phase ceramic fragments, which include the sherds decorated with the paint that we describe here, were chemically characterized and compared to the over 1,100 Early Formative sherds and raw clay sam- ples previously analyzed in conjunction with Blom- ster et al.'s (2005) study. While the pastes of 79 percent of the Canton Corralito specimens were unambiguously assigned to compositional groups that had been previously defined by INAA analy- ses of raw clays from the Mazatán and Gulf Coast regions, almost 10 percent showed membership in the Gulf Coast-derived San Lorenzo Gray and San Lorenzo White paste groups. Less than two percent of the Canton Corralito assemblage was assigned to an additional compositional group, Paste Group 1, which had not been recognized in the previous INAA analysis. The origin of Paste Group 1 remains a point of contention, even among the authors of this article. Neff and Glascock (2007) note that this group shows some compositional similarity to ceramics recovered from El Cerrito, a site located in the Acapetahua Estuary zone approx- imately 25 km from Canton Corralito, and suggest it may be composed of imports from neighboring areas to the northwest of Mazatán. However, a recent pétrographie analysis of several San Lorenzo and Canton Corralito sherds that included a Group 1 specimen showed that while Group 1 is miner- alogically distinct, it shares specific minerals with the San Lorenzo paste groups, and Cheetham et al. (2009) believe it may originate from the Gulf Coast. Finally, approximately 10 percent (n = 57) of the Canton Corralito specimens were labeled as "unas- signed" but are considered likely members of either Mazatán or San Lorenzo. Generally these samples showed strong compositional similarity to one of the two groups, yet fell slightly outside the proba- bility cutoff necessary for unambiguous group membership. In some cases, ceramics were unas- signed because they showed high probabilities of membership in both the San Lorenzo Gray and San Lorenzo White compositional groups. Despite their unassigned status, these specimens are clearly derived from the San Lorenzo area. Painted Sherd and Raw Pigment Samples David Cheetham recovered the 82 painted sherds analyzed for this study from Canton Corralito dur- ing his 2004 field season (Table 1). These sherds, all from vessels, utensils, figurines, or other ceramic objects manufactured in a Gulf Olmec technolog- ical style or decorated with Olmec iconography, were chosen for TOF-LA-ICP-MS analysis because they contained visible traces of red paint on their exteriors. In some cases the paint formed a thick, intact coating on the surface of the artifact. However, on most of the sherds the paint had almost completely weathered away, and was visible only in pores and depressions of the sherd's surface when examined with a lOx hand lens. Most of the paints analyzed for this study were on Cuadros phase carved-incised bolstered or direct rim serving vessels, including 34 Calzadas Carved and 27 Limón Incised specimens. Other Cuadros phase paints include 1 1 on zone-decorated Tatagapa Red, one on fine-paste La Mina White, one on a ceramic spatula handle, and one on a figurine frag- ment. Cherla phase paint samples include one from a gray-black fine paste sherd, four from direct rim vessels, and two from earspool fragments. INAA analysis had previously been performed on the ceramic paste of all of the artifacts whose paint was analyzed in this study. Of the 82 painted sherds, 68 were unambiguously assigned to com- positional groups, including 60 to the Mazatán group, seven to the San Lorenzo Gray group, and one to Paste Group 1. Thirteen specimens were unassigned, but of these 1 1 were likely derived from Mazatán and two were likely derived from San Lorenzo. INAA data were unavailable for one specimen. Twenty-two raw pigment samples were also analyzed by TOF-LA-ICP-MS (Table 2). Eight specimens were found by Cheetham during exca- vations at Canton Corralito: three from Cherla phase contexts and five from Cuadros phase con- texts. Thirteen 13 pigment specimens are from San Lorenzo; these were excavated by Coe and Diehl in the 1960s and are currently curated at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale Uni- versity. The San Lorenzo raw pigments include one Ojochi phase (1500-1350 B.C.), two Chicha- rras phase (1250-1 150 B.C.), and 10 San Lorenzo phase (1150-900 B.C.).

One sample of raw hematite is a geological specimen taken from an outcrop atop the El Manatí hill, courtesy of Pon- ciano Ortiz. As described above, El Manatí has a history of use as a ritual location and source of raw hematite that extends back to the Early For- mative period. Analytical Methods The 82 painted sherds and the 22 raw pigment sam- ples were analyzed on the GBC Optimass 8000 Time of Flight ICP-MS with NewWave UP-213 laser ablation system at the Institute for Integrated Research in Materials, Environments and Society (IIRMES) at California State University, Long Beach. The time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrome- ter used in this study is particularly well suited for analyzing the highly transient signals associated with microscopic pigment samples. While other ICP-MS configurations scan the mass range over</page><page sequence="12">Backes et al.] THE COLOR OF INFLUENCE 81 a period of time, and thus require a relatively lengthy ablation and data acquisition period, TOF instruments accelerate and separate entire groups of ions (an ion "packet") by the different times ions of different masses require to reach the detector. This allows accurate results to be obtained from a minimal amount of sample material; the GBC Opti- mass used in this study collects 30,000 readings of the entire mass spectrum per second with greater than 1-amu resolution. Detection limits are in the sub-ppm range for most analytes. Preparation of the painted ceramic and raw hematite samples, which were typically between .3 cm and 1 cm in diameter, consisted only of mounting them to glass microscope slides with museum wax. To avoid removing the trace amounts of paint, the sherds were not cleaned before analysis. Instead, pre-ablation consisting of an initial, low-power pass of the laser across the sample removed surface contamination before data were collected. Paint on the majority of the ceramic samples was clearly visible only under the high-magnification video camera of the laser ablation system, so abla- tion required programming the laser to steer through pigmented areas and between areas of exposed ceramic matrix. Isolating trace amounts of paint from the underlying ceramic was also made easier by acquiring data in time-resolved mode, so that data were collected continually as the laser scanned over a series of samples and reference stan- dards, and the raw count data peaks corresponding to the times when the laser was ablating the areas of highest paint density were manually extracted from the resulting data set. Five replicate analyses, or five distinct ablation runs on separate but adja- cent areas of paint, were performed on each sam- ple, and the signal intensities resulting from the five replicates were averaged for each specimen. We found that this process of individually inspecting and extracting peaks from the data set provided a measure of quality control over the laser ablation process - in some cases one or more replicates in a five-replicate run resulted in clearly anomalous data, which could usually be seen as a low iron sig- nal accompanied by high silicon and aluminum signals. This was an indication that the laser had ablated through the pigment to the underlying ceramic, so these replicates were excluded from raw count averages. We analyzed the painted ceramic and raw hematite samples for a total of 44 major and minor elements. Five certified and/or characterized refer- ence materials (SRM 610, SRM 612, SRM 614, Glass Buttes obsidian and Ohio Red clay) were ablated during the same runs and under the same conditions as those applied to the painted sherds and pigment samples. We then calibrated the raw count data from pigments to those of the five standards using the approach suggested by Gratuze (1999; Gratuze et al. 2001). This method involves stan- dardizing blank-subtracted raw counts of each ele- ment to the counts of a single element, in this case aluminum, which functions as an internal standard. Following calibration we calculated individual ele- ment concentrations, which yielded parts-per-mil- lion (ppm) data for all 44 elements measured. Quantitative Methods Prior to the identification of compositional sub- groups it was necessary to address the possibility that minerals other than the hematite under study had inadvertently been analyzed by the LA-ICP- MS. The initial step involved an exploratory analy- sis of the data to determine which elements appeared to be associated with iron - we assumed that these were related to the origin of the iron oxide under study, and therefore part of the hematite's chemical signature (Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2007). Likewise, we assumed that elements not associated with iron were related to diluents to the iron oxide, such as minerals that were naturally mixed with hematite in geologic contexts or clays used as pigment binders. A preliminary principal components analysis and a two-tailed Pearson's correlation test applied to the ppm data for all 44 measured elements showed that ten elements, including Na, Al, Si, K, Ca, Zn, Rb, Nb, Cs, and Ba, occurred in varying concentrations from sam- ple to sample but were all negatively correlated with iron within the 95 percent confidence inter- val. Because these 10 elements were assumed not to be components of the hematite's chemical sig- natures, they were not used during subsequent data analyses. Iron and the remaining 33 elements were considered potential contributors to the chemical signatures that are related to the geological origins of the various iron oxides, and therefore were used to determine possible source-related subgroups.</page><page sequence="13">82 L ATI N AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1 , 201 2 The second measure designed to distinguish the hematite's chemical signatures from "noise" intro- duced by clays and other minerals involved per- forming subsequent statistical analyses using ratios of the remaining 33 elements to iron, rather than by using ppm data as is customary in many prove- nance investigations. Standardizing ppm concen- trations to iron addresses the wide variation in iron levels among raw hematite and paint by treating iron concentration as a dilution factor, thereby allowing more accurate comparisons of concen- trations of the minor and trace elements that make up the hematite's signature (Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2007; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2008). Finally, all Fe- ratio data were transformed to log- 10 ratio data. This not only minimizes the effect of widely-dif- fering elemental concentrations, but can also aid in correcting skewed distributions that can result if detection limits of an analytical technique have abbreviated the lower portion of an element's observed concentration range (Neff 2002). Subgroup Identification and Evaluation Because this study seeks to provide evidence of hematite sources and exchange independent of the movement of ceramics and other artifacts, non- compositional data such as archaeological context or stylistic attributes were not used as sources of information for developing initial hypotheses about source-related subgroups. Instead, we relied solely on compositional pattern-recognition tech- niques as a starting point for grouping samples. Principal components analysis (PC A) is a pattern- recognition technique that uses a series of mathe- matical operations on the data matrix to compress multivariate data into a smaller number of vari- ables, or principal components, which can then be examined readily as bivariate plots. The PCA data presented below were derived from the variance- covariance matrix of the Fe-ratio dataset, and include the results of simultaneous RQ-mode fac- tor analysis. This method gives factor scores for the variables in addition to principal component scores for the cases, so when plotted along with the PCA scores these factor scores graphically illustrate the relative importance of the various ele- ments to the overall compositional structure in the data (Neff 1994). Once the samples were projected into the prin- cipal components space and tentative group assign- ments were made, the groupings were evaluated by canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and Maha- lanobis distance calculations. CDA determines a series of functions that best separate members of predefined groups in multivariate space. In much the same way as PCA, CDA functions are exam- ined in pairs on scatterplots, and subgroups appear as clouds of high point density. In addition to allow- ing group memberships to be evaluated, CDA can project unassigned specimens into the canonical discriminant space in order to examine their rela- tionship to hypothesized subgroups. Mahalanobis distance calculations were used to test the mem- bership of subgroups on a case-by-case basis. Mahalanobis distance is a multivariate generaliza- tion of standardized univariate distance, which incorporates information on group variance-covari- ance structure to assign group membership of indi- vidual samples. For this study, which had a small sample size and correspondingly small group sizes, PCA and/or CDA scores were used as variables when performing Mahalanobis calculations on hypothesized subgroups. Reducing dimensionality in this way increases the specimen-to- variate ratio, thus enhancing reliability of the Mahalanobis-dis- tance calculations. Results Fe-ratio data were generated for the 82 samples of hematite on Canton Corralito ceramics and 22 raw hematite samples from Canton Corralito and San Lorenzo. Principal components were then calcu- lated from the variance-covariance matrix of the log-transformed Fe-ratio data; the first six princi- pal components were found to account for approx- imately 80 percent of the cumulative variance in the data set (Table 3). Figure 4, a biplot of the first and second principal components, shows that raw pig- ments clearly differentiate from paints on pottery along the first principal component, with raw pig- ments generally having lower scores than painted sherds; in addition, the original variables (elemen- tal Fe-ratios) all have consistently positive loadings on that component (Table 4). This suggests that the discarding of elements negatively correlated to iron was not sufficient to completely correct the effects of dilution of the hematite - additional variation related to dilution is found in the first principal com- ponent, with higher scores resulting from an over-</page><page sequence="14">Backes et al.] THE COLOR OF INFLUENCE 83 Table 3.

The biplot (Figure 6) shows that variation in antimony, arsenic, lead, vanadium, and manganese is most responsible for creating the separation of Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 while elongating Group 5. Rare earth elements, particularly lanthanum, praseodymium, and neodymium, act with manganese to separate Group 5 and seem to contribute to the elongation of Groups 1 and 4. The memberships of these compositional groups are summarized in Table 5. Group 1 has 24 mem- bers, including 15 painted sherds and nine raw pig- ments. The painted sherds are all Cuadros phase and include six Limón Incised, six Tatagapa Red and three Calzadas Carved specimens. Of the 15 total sherds, 10 have been assigned by INAA to the Mazatán paste group and two have been assigned to the San Lorenzo Gray paste group. The remain- ing three sherds are unassigned by INAA, but are most likely derived from a Mazatán clay source. The raw hematite in Group 1 consists entirely of specimens from the Gulf Coast, including eight samples recovered from excavations at San Lorenzo, and the single modern geologic sample from El Manatí. Group 2 has only four members: three painted sherds and one raw pigment. The sherds, all Cuadros phase, include one Limón Incised, one Calzadas Carved, and one Tatagapa Red. INAA has shown membership in the Mazatán paste group for two of the sherds; the third sherd's paste is unas- signed but may also link to a Mazatán source.

The sherds come from a variety of ceramic types: 1 1 Limón Incised, nine Calzadas Carved, four Tatagapa Red, four Cherla phase vessels, one gray-black fine paste, one black paste, one bol- stered rim dish, one spatula handle, and one fig- urine. With the exception of a single unassigned outlier, the four Cherla vessels included in this sub- group comprise all of Cherla phase painted ceram- ics analyzed in this study. INAA paste group assignments for the 33 ceramic artifacts include 25 to the Mazatán group and two to the San Lorenzo Gray group. Five specimens were unassigned by INAA, although three show possible membership in the Mazatán paste group and two show possible membership in the San Lorenzo Gray paste group. INAA data are unavailable for one sherd. Group 3 raw pigment samples include two recovered from Canton Corralito (one Cuadros phase and one Cherla phase) and three from San Lorenzo. Group 4 has 19 members, including 17 painted sherds and two raw pigments. The sherds include 13 Calzadas Carved, three Limón Incised, and one La Mina White. Of the 17 total sherds, 1 1 have been assigned by INAA to the Mazatán paste group, two have been assigned to the San Lorenzo Gray paste group, and one has been assigned to Paste Group 1 . The remaining three sherds are unassigned by INAA, but are most likely derived from a Mazatán clay source. One raw pigment was recovered from a Cuadros phase context at Canton Corralito, while the other is a Chicharras phase sample from San Lorenzo. Group 5, with four members, stands apart from the other compositional groups because it is composed entirely of Cuadros and Cherla phase raw pigment samples from Canton Corralito. No painted sherds are included in Group 5. The five hypothesized compositional groups were evaluated through CDA using log transformed Fe-ratio data of all 33 elements as variables. The resulting bivariate plot of the first two functions shows that there is clear separation of subgroups at the 90 percent confidence level (Figure 7).

Finally, we conducted a posterior classifica- tion of Groups 1,3, and 4 using Mahalanobis dis- tances calculated with canonical discriminant functions 1 through 4 as variables. This analysis confirmed membership for specimens assigned to these three subgroups - all specimens were found to exceed the one percent probability cut- off for group membership, and many showed probabilities in excess of 10 percent. One painted sherd (DCC250) showed a high probability of membership in both Group 3 and Group 4; this specimen was maintained as a member of Group 4 because it clusters with that subgroup in bivari- ate plots. The small sizes of Group 2 and Group 5 precluded their analysis through Mahalanobis distance calculation, but the members of these groups were projected against the Groups 1,3, and 4 to rule out the possibility that they should have been assigned to one of those larger groups. These calculations showed less than one percent probability that any members of Group 2 and Group 5 should have been assigned membership in Groups 1, 3, or 4. Fifteen of the samples analyzed, including 14 painted sherds and one raw pigment from San Lorenzo, were left unassigned. Eleven of these are specimens that fail to show a significant probabil- ity of group membership in Groups 1, 3, or 4, and fail to fall within the 90 percent confidence level for Group 2 or Group 5 on PC A or CDA bivariate plots. Mahalanobis distance calculation for unas- signed specimens suggested group memberships (probabilities &gt;1 percent) for four painted sherds (DCC007, DCC257, DCC419, and DCC421) and one raw pigment specimen (DCP29, recovered from San Lorenzo). However, these were left unas- signed because they broadened the groups to which they might be assigned, thus attenuating the over- all discrimination.</page><page sequence="19">88 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1, 2012 Discussion TOF-LA-ICP-MS analysis of the paint on ceram- ics and raw pigments resulted in the identification of five compositional groups. Three of these groups include sherds that are proven through INAA to have been manufactured in the Gulf Coast and in Mazatán; of these, one group (Group 1) includes raw pigments that were recovered from the San Lorenzo region, while the other two (Groups 3 and 4) include chemically identical raw pigments recovered from both San Lorenzo and Canton Cor- ralito. Given that several prehistorically exploited hematite sources have been noted in the San Lorenzo area, but none are known in the vicinity of Canton Corralito, we believe these three com- positional groups can best be explained as evi- dence of export: Olmec vessels were being decorated as well as manufactured in San Lorenzo for export to the Pacific Coast, and Gulf Coast hematite was exported to Canton Corralito, where it was used to decorate locally produced Olmec- style vessels. The remaining two compositional groups (Groups 2 and 5) are composed of hematites that were recovered from Canton Cor- ralito or found in paints on ceramics manufactured in the vicinity of that site. These may represent pre- historically exploited hematite sources in Maza- tán that have remained unknown to archaeologists, or they may represent two varieties of hematite that were imported to Canton Corralito and applied to locally manufactured pots. Group 1, with 24 members, shows the most compelling evidence of pigment export from the Gulf Coast to the Soconusco region: in this group, 15 sherds excavated from Cantón Corralito have paint showing compositional similarity to eight raw hematite samples, all which were recovered from San Lorenzo. None of the raw pigments in this group were excavated from Canton Corralito. Group 1 also includes the modern raw hematite specimen from El Manatí, the spring in the San Lorenzo region that was used ritually by the Gulf Olmec and is known ethnographically as a source of regionally traded hematite (Ortiz and Rodríguez 1999, 2000). If compositional heterogeneity among Gulf Coast hematite outcrops is assumed (a rea- sonable assumption considering the findings of researchers who have examined hematite variabil- ity in other regions; see Erlandson et al. 1999; Iri- arte et al. 2009; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2007; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2008), these findings strongly suggest that El Manatí was the source of the hematite in the Group 1 paints and pigments. Evi- dence for pigment exchange independent of ceramic exchange is bolstered by Group 1 's INAA paste data, which show that of the 15 sherds included in the group, 10 are made of paste derived from Mazatán sources, three are likely Mazatán paste, and two show unambiguous membership in the San Lorenzo Gray compositional group. In short, a comparison of TOF-LA-ICP-MS data with INAA data shows that at least two-thirds of the ceramics that comprise Group 1 were manufac- tured in the Mazatán region, yet were decorated with hematite that originated in the Gulf Coast region, and was likely from the El Manatí source. The remaining Group 1 ceramics were manufac- tured (and probably decorated) at San Lorenzo before being exported to the Mazatán region. Group 3, the largest group, shows the most evi- dence of consistency in hematite use over time. Group 3 is the only group containing painted sherds from both the Cherla and Cuadros phases at Canton Corralito - in fact, all of the Cherla phase painted ceramics analyzed in this study, with the exception of one unassigned outlier, are in this group. INAA data for the clay paste of the 33 sherds in Group 3 show that 25 are assigned to the Mazatán compositional group, three are likely Mazatán, two show membership in the San Lorenzo Gray group, and two are likely San Lorenzo Gray members. INAA data are missing for one sherd. The definite or likely San Lorenzo Gray members were all recovered from Cuadros phase contexts, with one exception: a gray-black, fine paste Cherla sherd that is unambiguously a member of the San Lorenzo Gray paste group. Further evidence for long-term use of this partic- ular hematite can be seen in the Group 3 raw pig- ments from San Lorenzo, which were found in contexts spanning up to 600 years, from the onset of the Ojochi phase at 1500 B.C. to the close of the San Lorenzo phase at 900 B.C. Groups 1, 4, and 5 also have raw pigments that span multiple phases, but the painted sherds in these groups are all restricted to Cuadros phase. Group 4 also appears to show evidence of pig- ment exchange, but is more temporally restricted. This group includes 17 painted sherds, all recov-</page><page sequence="20">Backes et al.] THE COLOR OF INFLUENCE 89 ered from Cuadros phase contexts. INAA data for these sherds show that 1 1 are members of the Maza- tán paste group, two are San Lorenzo Gray paste, and one is Group 1 paste. The three remaining sherds are likely members of the Mazatán group. It should also be noted that the two raw pigments showing membership in Group A - one recovered from Cuadros phase Cantón Corralito and one from Chicharras phase San Lorenzo - were both found as small, prepared block-shaped pieces. Admit- tedly the sample size of these prepared blocks is very small, but they may constitute evidence of trade or of some uniformity in hematite processing practices between the two regions. At the very least, Group 4 consists of paints on ceramics that were manufactured on both coasts, as well as raw pig- ments that were recovered from sites on both coasts. In contrast, the raw pigments that are members of Groups 2 and 5 were all recovered from Cantón Corralito. Group 2 consists of one raw hematite sample recovered from a Cherla phase context, together with three Cuadros phase sherds that have been determined by INAA to be definite or likely members of the Mazatán compositional group. Group 5 is composed entirely of raw Canton Co- rralito pigments, and includes no painted sherds from Canton Corralito or raw pigments from San Lorenzo. Groups 2 and 5 may therefore represent two compositionally distinct hematites that were brought to Canton Corralito from elsewhere and applied to locally manufactured pots. Clearly, there is also a possibility that one or both of these groups point to a local Pacific Coast hematite source, although no such source is known at present. Conclusions By contending that "the regions outside the Gulf Coast appear to be primarily consumers and emu- lators rather than exporters and innovators of Olmec-style motifs," Blomster et al. (2005:1071) argue that those regions placed as much value on the symbolism carried by the vessels as they did on the vessels themselves. Their 2005 study and a recent INAA analysis of ceramics from Canton Corralito (Cheetham 2010a, 2010b) have shown that a large number of Olmec-style vessels were produced in sites outside of the Gulf Coast, includ- ing at Cantón Corralito, but no INAA evidence exists to show that carved and incised vessels were being exported from these areas to San Lorenzo region. This would seem to suggest that symbolic expressions originating in the Gulf Coast enjoyed more value than locally produced copies of the same symbolism. In addition to providing evidence that compo- sitionally identical pigments were used by Early Formative groups on both coasts, the results of this TOF-LA-ICP-MS analysis suggest that the hematite itself may have added to the symbolic and economic value of Olmec iconography, particu- larly in copies of Olmec-style pots produced out- side of San Lorenzo. Hematite and Olmec motifs clearly went hand-in-hand, because the carved and incised elements that formed these motifs were almost always filled with hematite. In addition, at least one prehistorically exploited hematite source on the Gulf Coast, El Manatí, is known to have been the site of extensive ritual activity in the past. There- fore, the appearance of the same hematite on Olmec-style vessels produced at Canton Corralito may indicate that the pigment was more than sim- ply a coloring agent - it may have served the func- tion of adding religious and symbolic value to locally produced emulations of Gulf Coast wares. Di Castro and Cyphers (2009:33) likewise suggest a sacred role for the use of red pigment on ceram- ics at San Lorenzo. The relationship between TOF-LA-ICP-MS pigment groups and INAA paste groups described in this study supports the notion that, at least in some cases, Gulf Coast pigment accompanied Gulf Coast iconography. Three of the five compositional groups established by this analysis include chem- ically identical raw pigments recovered from both San Lorenzo and Canton Corralito, and include a large percentage of sherds that are proven through INAA to have been manufactured in Mazatán. Most notable is Group 1, which includes both Mazatán and San Lorenzo sherds holding paint that is com- positionally identical to nine raw hematite samples from San Lorenzo and a geologic specimen from El Manatí. We believe that the presence of identi- cal raw pigments on both coasts, combined with the knowledge that several prehistorically exploited hematite sources such as El Manatí exist in the San Lorenzo area, strongly suggest two scenarios: that some Olmec vessels were being manufactured and decorated in San Lorenzo for export to the Pacific Coast, and that Gulf Coast hematite was exported</page><page sequence="21">90 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1, 2012 to Cantón Corralito, where it was used to enhance Olmec-style symbolism on locally produced ves- sels. But Early Formative pigment use may be more complex than these scenarios suggest - the other two compositional groups include raw pigment and painted sherds recovered from Canton Corralito that cannot be correlated with any hematite found at San Lorenzo. Our data are currently too limited to determine with certainty whether these groups represent Gulf Coast hematite sources, a currently unknown Pacific Coast source, or a source located somewhere else in Mesoamerica. Further explo- ration of these connections will require a system- atic characterization of raw hematite sources in and out of the Gulf Coast region, including a search for sources that may have been exploited directly by the inhabitants of Canton Corralito.

Due to variations in the amount of C14 in the atmosphere, radiocarbon dates fluctuate and generally become progres- sively younger than calendar dates as one goes back in time. Calibration would make dates for the Early Formative phases discussed in this paper approximately 200 years earlier than the uncalibrated dates.
