<plain_text><page sequence="1">Williams, Bernard. Shame and Necessity. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. xii + 254 pp. Cloth, $25; paper, $15.00?Bernard Williams turns not to philosophy, but to poetry?to archaic and fifth century Greece?as the source of the Greeks' ethical world. His declared aim is to understand the poets as poets, not as philosophers. At first blush this seems problematic. Can we take seriously the notion of a responsi ble moral agent in a world where the forces of supernatural necessity, fate, and luck make mortals seem like divine playthings? It is in this context, however, that Williams investigates the role of tragedy and its place in Greek society, thus paying homage to his teacher at Oxford, Eric Dodds, author of The Greeks and the Irrational. Williams</page><page sequence="2">686 GIUSEPPE BUTERA AND STAFF discusses specific agents in specific circumstances?Ajax bent on self-destruction, Oedipus ignorant of the pollution of his actions, Aga memnon in a fit of madness about to murder his daughter, Achilles fully aware of his chosen fate, and others?in order to display people who make decisions and act on them. He attempts to show that the foundations of our ethical views, rooted in conceptions of agency, re sponsibility, shame, and necessity, are already present in Homer, thus silencing the claim of certain modern moralists that the Homeric char acters are childish and incapable of true morality. This is by no means a study in cultural anthropology. It is predicated on the notion that there are common grounds between Greek ethical ideas and our own, even if our cultures are, in many respects, worlds apart. What separates us is obvious: anthropomorphic beliefs about the gods and their interference in the lives of mortals, dependence on slavery for the economic necessities, and acceptance of the inferiority of women. Williams attempts to understand the Greeks as they under stood themselves. The most pervasive question of the entire study is whether Greek morality is relevant today or has there been an "evolution" in ethical thought. The latter supposes that the "primitive ideas of action, respon sibility, ethical motivation, and justice" of the Greeks have been re placed with "a more complex and refined set of conceptions that define a more mature form of ethical experience" (p. 5). This view, which Williams calls the "progressivist" view of morality, meets considerable opposition as we encounter one after another penetrating study of some of the best known characters of early Greek drama through which a bona fide theory of action is developed making humans respon sible agents, capable of deliberating and acting accordingly. The core of this brilliant and scholarly study (only those with a com mand of Greek will make proper use of the accompanying notes), is the analysis of various senses of "necessity" reminiscent of Aristotle's multiple meanings from Book A of the Metaphysics (of which Williams makes no mention). He begins with Homeric or Sophoclean necessity to discover what forces drive agents to certain "necessary" acts?for example, Ajax to suicide. In this analysis shame is a powerful motive and Williams explains why archaic Greece is sometimes referred to as a "shame culture." He proceeds to discuss necessity in the sense of constraints imposed by people or by circumstances in order to explain why the Greeks thought slavery "necessary." Finally, Williams dis cusses supernatural or divine necessity, such as that which drove Agamemnon to infanticide or Oedipus to parricide. The aim is to understand possibility and the limits imposed on human action. Under standing constraint requires understanding its opposite; namely, free dom and what it means to act freely. It is here that Greek philosophy, in the names of Plato and Aristotle, enters the discussion in contrast to Sophocles, Euripides, and even Thucydides. This is not, however, a re-visiting of the theme of the dominance of philosophy over poetry. Philosophy presents the promise of an alternative cosmology in which "the universe or history or the structure of human reason can, when properly understood, yield a pattern that makes sense of human life</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 687 and human aspirations" (p. 163). This is not, however, the view of Greek tragedy, which presents an inharmonious world view. Thus, Williams' ultimate project is to explicate the sense that ancient tragedy makes to our ethical lives. Because of our special link to the Greeks, a study of the identity of content between Greek morality and our own is a means to better self-understanding.?Jerrold R.
