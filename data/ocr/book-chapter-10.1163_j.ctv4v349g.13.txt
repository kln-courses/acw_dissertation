<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  111 Chapter 4 Martino and Martino A Quantitative Method for the Creation of  Typologies for Qualitatively Described Objects Shannon Martino and Matthew Martino In our natural attempts to determine patterns and similarity, certain attributes  come to be considered more important than others. We attempt to find pat- terns even when they may not exist. This is well illustrated by the reaction to a  famous question posed by Lewis Carroll’s Mad Hatter in Alice's Adventures in  Wonderland: “Why is a raven like a writing desk?” In the preface to the 1896  edition of the book Carroll says: Enquiries have been so often addressed to me, as to whether any answer  to the Hatter's riddle can be imagined, that I may as well put on record  here what seems to be a fairly appropriate answer, viz: “Because it can  produce few notes, tho [sic] they are very flat; and it is never put with the  wrong end in front!” This, however, is merely an afterthought; the Riddle,  as originally invented, had no answer at all. While Carroll eventually gave into popular demand and provided an answer to  this riddle, the continued fascination of his readers with this one particular  phrase speaks to the human urge to find similarities between any two given  objects. It is this urge, along with the oft-noted urge to detect differences, that  makes classification such a natural part of the human character and one so  prone to subjective conclusions.  Typologies are used by archaeologists to easily identify objects that are sim- ilar to each other by classifying similar artifacts into groups so that one can  speak of a “type” rather than an individual object. And, initially, differences  between these types were seen to be indications of cultural difference. This  practice of classification, a key concept in Western scholarly thought, which is  its own academic field,1 is the underpinning of much archaeological dating.2  1 Gordon 1999. 2 Roy and Reason 1979. © Shannon Martino and Matthew Martino, 2018 | doi 10.1163/9789004375086_006 This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the prevailing CC-BY-NC License. </page> <page sequence="2"> 112 Martino And Martino Yet subjectivity in typologies is unavoidable given the essentializing nature of  typologies as well as their inherently sociopolitical nature.3 As Sorin Hermon  and Franco Niccolucci have stated, “One of the major ‘weaknesses’ of typologi- cal research is the nature itself of types – being defined partly intuitively and  partly rationally, [they are] partly essential and partly instrumental, most typo- logical lists are polythetic, so there are no fixed criteria of ‘typehood.’”4 Histori- cally, the types defined in archaeological typologies have been viewed as  distinct entities that have meaning within the culture to which they belong,  and, in the first half of the 1900s, they were thought to be the most objective  way to study ancient peoples.5 By the late 1960s, however, it was recognized  that archaeological types are defined by the archaeologist in ways that may not  reflect the types defined by the prehistoric peoples.6 Some, such as William and Ernest Adams, have entirely dismissed the ne- cessity of complete objectivity in the creation of typologies and even the dis- cussion of objectivity when it comes to typologies, saying “useful typologies  require intersubjective agreement,” i.e., a relationship between the work of all  scholars on the subject.7 They further note that the “development of type con- cepts” is contingent on the collection of objects being studied.8 Moreover, they  suggest that while initial types are often created through an intuitive recogni- tion of similarity, later types are defined by difference from the very beginning  of their recognition.9 When scholars look to create a typology, however, they try to distance them- selves from assumptions of similarity and difference. Those assumptions are  unavoidably colored by the invaluable knowledge of the times in which the  object was created, as well as by previous research on the subject—but also by  one’s possibly flawed understanding of which particular aspects of the object  indicate human agency, and which were necessitated by the functionality and  material composition of the object. One must ask oneself not what a defining  attribute of that object is, but what it could be, and then must be brutally hon- est about what one sees. If we are not careful, what might be viewed a signifi- cant factor to us but not to the producer of an object can be heavily influential  3 Gnecco and Langebaek 2014, v. 4 Hermon and Niccolucci 2002, 217. 5 Hermon and Niccolucci 2002, 218. 6 Tixier 1967. 7 Adams and Adams 1991, 4. 8 Adams and Adams, 1991, 53. 9 Adams and Adams, 1991, 54–55. </page> <page sequence="3"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  113 Figure 4.1   Fliegende Blätter, October 23,   1892 in the creation of a typology. In other words, the aspects of an object’s produc- tion could be unnecessarily sidelined in favor of decoration, form, and pre- sumed use. More than this, though, were typologies simply to be viewed as  abstractions of data with no historical relevance to creation of the artifact it- self, each independently created typology would be different. Thus each typol- ogy’s utility in every case would have to be rigorously justified by the scientific  question posed by the researcher.10 People’s susceptibility to getting stuck seeing one thing when another is  possible was satirized long ago by the rabbit/duck image, which seems to have  first been published in Fliegende Blätter, a German humor magazine in  Munich,11 and was picked up that same year by Harper’s Weekly (Fig. 4.1).12 The original text asked, “Which animals are the most similar to each other?”  The answer was “rabbit and duck.” But studies by the Bruggers in the 1990s  found that what animal people see in the image can be influenced by the date  on which they see the image. For example, children who see the image near  Easter are more likely to see a rabbit.13 10 Thank you to Elena Rova for presenting this insight. 11 A facsimile of this image in Fliegende Blätter is available from the University of Heidelberg  historical literature collection: &lt;https://doi.org/10.11588/diglit.2137#0147&gt; (accessed May  20, 2017). 12 Brugger 1999. 13 Brugger and Brugger 1993. </page> <page sequence="4"> 114 Martino And Martino Though such extraneous happenings can affect what we see, the methodol- ogy for the creation of archaeological typologies is little discussed by their cre- ators.14 In this sense, it is much like the creation of sausage, for as much as one  would like to ignore how the sausages are made, the methodology behind one’s  typology should be as clear as the linkages that eventually arise from its com- pletion. Without a clear system of analysis, all typologies are leaps of faith and  intuition. Adams and Adams even point to intuition as the way in which initial  types are often created from a collection of objects.15 While intuition often  leads to discovery, a scientific argument builds “on such an intuition, shows  how the linkage is possible, and therefore [is] arguable” rather than entirely  subjective.16 Because the reasoning from points A to Z is clear, the whole is  clear. By presenting the reader with the details of this methodology in two  separate case studies, we hope to make our own typological creation as trans- parent as possible. Admittedly, as with many ideas, intuition led to the proj- ect’s creation.  Case Studies Background Using the method proposed here, the first case study presents the creation of a  typology for a database of figurines, and the second case study creates a typol- ogy for a set of pottery. The first study compares Late Chalcolithic and Early  Bronze Age (c. 5000–2500 bce) clay anthropomorphic figurines from Bulgaria,  Romania and Turkey by creating a FileMaker database of almost 2000 figu- rines.17  Such a large and seemingly disparate corpus was chosen for analysis in  order to elucidate some of the contemporaneity of figurine production and  decoration trends in the analyzed areas. Though many scholars have previ- ously noted the stylistic similarity of these figurines, definitive chronological  relationships eluded them.18 Those who noted the contemporaneity of figu- rines from the areas of Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey tended to focus on ear- lier periods such as the Neolithic. In that period, presumably the figurines of  both Greece and Turkey were similar not due to continuous interaction but,  rather, to migrations of farmers bringing with them the various components of  14 Adams and Adams, 1991, 60. 15 Adams and Adams, 1991, 54. 16 Buccellati 2007, 37. 17 Martino 2012. 18 Kökten, Özgüç, and Özgüç 1945; Alkım, Alkım, and Bilgi 1988; Thissen 1993; Bilgi 2001. </page> <page sequence="5"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  115 the “Neolithic package”—a collection of technologies and beliefs that was  once thought to be wholeheartedly and without exception adopted along with  agriculture. Svend Hansen’s study Bilder vom Menschen der Steinzeit is the most compre- hensive of all recent diachronic studies of figurines and includes a discussion  of all the known figurine types from western Europe to the Near East, from the  Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age.19  The figurine attributes listed in Hansen’s  typology are numerous and comprehensive, but they are not additionally uti- lized in a systematic analysis. Many of them, however, were used to create the  attribute list compiled for the figurines in this study.  Methodological Background In the interest of reducing subjectivity in their analyses, archaeologists and  ancient art historians have used various methods from the statistical sciences.  They have done so since the 1950s, but particularly since the 1970s, with the  additon of the aid of computers.20 Archaeologists, however, first approached  statistical methods through the lens of factor analysis in the late 1960s.21 This  type of analysis, which defined objects as a descriptive list of qualities, or “fac- tors,” allowed objects to be classified “automatically” rather than subjectively.22  Statistical analyses closely followed such factor analyses and will be described  in more detail below.  We might then ask, why have these approaches not been used more widely?  One explanation might be found in the battle over the use of statistical tech- niques to determine type in archaeology. These battles marked the arrival of  “New or Processual Archaeology” and its staunch belief in the objectivity of its  methods. This conflict is epitomized in the heated back-and-forth regarding  the use of statistical methods between the archaeologists James Ford and Al- bert Spaulding in the early 1950s. The debate resulted from Spaulding’s review  of Ford’s typological schema and Spaulding’s promotion of statistical methods  19 Hansen 2007. 20 Spaulding 1953; Guralnick 1973; Bartel 1981; Hermon and Niccolucci 2002; Gansell et al.  2014, 194–205. 21 Factor analysis: a type of analysis that defines objects as a descriptive list of qualities, i.e.,  factors. 22 Hermon and Niccolucci 2002, 220. </page> <page sequence="6"> 116 Martino And Martino for the creation of archaeological types.23 While we will not put forward a new  analysis of this general debate, as this has already been done elsewhere, below  are a few of the most important quotes from this discussion: Ford Response to Spaulding Article, February 1954: Spaulding and some of his associates have been trained to prefer a stable  finite world provided with tangible facts which, together with the logical  truths that connect them, are all waiting to be discovered. This may make  sense as a scientific ideal; I'm not too certain. However, “reality” is fre- quently confused with the ability of man to contact the phenomena with  his five senses—a stone is real. Artifacts and observable situations are the  “real” experienceable facts of archeology. Many cautious students have  concentrated on these realities, thus hoping to avoid the risky business of  stacking hypotheses into what may be a shaky structure...  The indiscriminate application of statistical formulas to archeological  problems is not an activity of a cultural scientist. Spaulding Response to Ford, April 1954: Ford's objections to the ideas advanced in [my article] appear to revolve  around (1) the notion that use of such techniques somehow constitutes a  denial of continuous variation of culture in time and space and (2) cer- tain implicit definitions of such terms as “artifact type” and “historical  usefulness” which in effect make their use the exclusive prerogative of  the archaeologist engaged in inferring chronology by ranking sites or  components of sites in order of likeness as judged by relative frequency  of attribute combinations. I shall attempt to show that the first objection  is a gratuitous error and that the second is no more than a semantic quag- mire. Ford Response to Spaulding, April 1954: First let me say that I am thoroughly sympathetic to all efforts toward  development of more accurate methodology. But the application of sta- tistics and other techniques to our problems, without regard for basic  culture theory, cannot be regarded as an advance in technique...  Spaulding's suggestion that statistical analysis of the patterning to be  found in a collection from a village site will establish pottery types useful  in the study of culture history is amazingly naïve. 23 Ford and Steward 1954. </page> <page sequence="7"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  117 Spaulding Response to Ford – April 1954: The concept of reality, which Ford persists in rejecting, does not imply  tangibility, stability, finiteness, or “a world filled with packaged facts and  truths that may be discovered and digested like Easter eggs hidden on a  lawn,” as Ford asserts, but it does imply that the proper procedure for test- ing the truth is an appeal to the data of this external world. As is clear from the quoted passages, the focus of the debate is on the real and  experiential vs. the hypothetical and statistical. These are arguments that in- evitably appear in relationship to the use of new technologies in archaeology.  The arguments are suspicious of technology that could seemingly divorce one- self from the data to such an extent that the context of the data, and the knowl- edge that precedes the analysis, is superseded by the results of the analysis.  Although, to many of us, Ford’s rejection of Spaulding’s methods might  seem out of place today, he is correct to remind archaeologists not to divorce  their cultural knowledge from statistical analyses. It is thus unsurprising that  Adams and Adams, who dismiss complete objectivity in typology creation,  would also side with Ford.24 While the analytical techniques of statistics can  hinder us due to the assumptions they make, they also help inform us of real- world complexities. That is why it is so essential that archaeologists with  knowledge of the material either learn to do the analyses themselves or work  closely in developing the technology. They must also reflect on the assump- tions inherent in their work. Such reflection is admittedly not always readily  available, nor is it always broadcast.25 That is why a volume such as this, with  the intent to provide analyses and the background necessary to understand  the methodologies, is so important. As long as one remains careful about how one treats the data, statistical  methods can be effective tools. Consciousness of the inherent subjectivity of  one’s typology can make the analysis of objects grouped in a typology all the  more meaningful. Accepting a typology blindly, as some have done, without  considering other outcomes for one’s data, will not reveal the complexities of  one’s dataset. This has led some to emphasize the entanglement of artifacts  and Marian Feldman in particular to move away from geographically defined  styles to the notion of “communities of styles.”26 As she has put it, “It is not just  that these objects have resisted any straightforward or singular definition of  24 Adams and Adams 1991, 59. 25 Adams and Adams 1991, 60. 26 Entanglement is defined in Archaeology as the way in which all artifacts are interdepen- dent and owe their existence—and, here especially, their visual appearance—to this  interdependency and relatedness (Hodder 2012; Feldman 2014). </page> <page sequence="8"> 118 Martino And Martino meaning; it is also my sense that this very enchantment itself exists (and ex- isted in the past) as an integral part of [an object’s] material purpose.”27 A ty- pology then ought to reflect the mutable nature of an object. While the ability of the method proposed here to capture this mutab il- ity is emphasized (see discussion section below), tried-and-true meth ods—  particularly multivariate analysis—are heavily relied upon to provide the  backbone of the code. Multivariate analysis is one method often utilized by  archaeologists to create typologies, but it is not simply one tool that is easily  employed in the same way by everyone regardless of the purpose. It is, rather,  a general description for a type of analysis that takes many forms. One must  always adapt the method to the material that one wishes to analyze. Using  a multivariate analysis, archaeologists can determine the types that define a  typology through the analysis of multiple variables and their interdependency.  Furthermore, such statistical methods were created for quantitative analyses  and have traditionally placed more value on certain attributes of the archaeo- logical artifact. Cluster analysis,28 a particular form of multivariate analysis  that divides a dataset into groups based on how near the data points are to  each other, gives one the ability to analyze subgroups of the dataset using an  algorithm.29 Analyses of ancient figurines have often utilized multivariate analysis to  elucidate connections between types of figurines. Saul Weinberg was the first  scholar to use an attribute analysis in order to compare Neolithic figurines,  though he did not use a computer.30 In 1968, however, Peter Ucko became one  of the first archaeologists and art historians to utilize a computer-assisted nu- merical-attribute analysis. Ucko’s study examined Neolithic anthropomorphic  figurines from Egypt, Anatolia, and Greece, beginning with an analysis of the  numbers of regionally affiliated attributes and proceeding to cross-cultural  ones.31 He argued against isolating specific figurine attributes for analysis and  against considering unprovenanced material.32  Brad Bartel’s 1981 article introduced a multivariate-attribute-analysis ap- proach to the study of figurines that additionally correlated and measured the  27 Feldman 2014, 175. 28 Cluster analysis: a type of analysis that divides a set of objects into groups (clusters) so  that objects of one group are similar to each other, whereas objects within groups are dis- similar from the objects within other groups.

The attributes he included in his  factor analysis were mostly stylistic, but they also included clay and posture.  Logically, attributes found in all figurines or only in one were not included in  his study because neither would illuminate relations between cultures. His list  of attributes and his methodology constituted a starting point for the one used  in Shannon Martino’s study. Unfortunately, the program Bartel used in his  study was not done on a modern computer and used punch cards, which are  lost to us today. In 1995 Peter Biehl used an attribute-analysis approach in his study of  Gradešnitsa figurines c. 5000–4500 bce in northwest Bulgaria in order to deter- mine whether designs were chosen based on their location on the body of a  figure.33 His interest in combining an analysis of the location of attributes with  a description of those attributes informed much of the creation of Shannon  Martino’s database. What characterizes her study, and all these previous ones,  is the large amount of data. Those of us who deal with the archaeological  equivalent of “big data” are drawn to methods that naturally involve mathe- matical approaches necessitating computing power.  For the figurine analysis, Shannon Martino recorded the presence or ab- sence of about 300 independent attributes that characterized the technologi- cal as well as the iconographic features of the figurines (Appendix 4.1). For  example, under the heading “arm,” there are 32 attributes that describe decora- tion, position, and modeling. Techniques of manufacture include features of  surface treatment (e.g., slip, vertical burnishing, paint, or even fingerprints). By  including so many attributes, Shannon Martino was able to consider a wide  range of the possible traditions within figurine production and create a more  nuanced typology that allowed significant clusters of features, both formal and  technical, to emerge. Rather than imposing any preconceived cluster of attributes, we developed  a series of independent attributes. In this way, what might be viewed as a sig- nificant factor to us but not to the producer of the artifact would not be as  heavily influential in the creation of a class.34 The subjectivity of this analysis  will still be the subject of debate for anyone who disagrees.  For example,  someone might ask what might be considered a nose, or arms, but as long as  the observer is consistent, there will be consistency in the assessment of what  it means to have arms. Thus the name “arms” might not always be perceived as  accurate, but what is identified as “arms” will be.  33 Biehl 1996. 34 Class here refers to an identified typological group, though group is the term used by the  program for all possible classes that are output. </page> <page sequence="10"> 120 Martino And Martino  Project Methodology Matthew Martino was responsible for writing the code of the program in c++,35  and in the midst of collaboration, we discovered many difficulties in analyzing  the qualitative data usually examined in regards to figurines.36 The program,  therefore, was written in an iterative process.37 The goal was to create groups  based on similarity, but determining how to gauge similarity required us to test  the program several times to see what results various algorithms would pro- duce. So a large portion of the development of the program consisted of refin- ing and modifying the algorithms that it used to define groups. Eventually we  settled on the procedure outlined below. We used a hierarchical clustering algorithm that defined clusters (types) by  considering how similar objects were to each other (in a quantitative fashion)  and grouping “close” objects into the same type. The method that we used to  determine how similar objects are is called metric scaling. This is done by con- sidering each item as a point in a multidimensional space and calculating the  “distance” between the points using a metric, just as one finds the distance  between points on a map. As Torsten Madsen has noted, there is a problem  with this method, namely that “the connection between objects and variables  is broken...It is not possible to see the contribution of the individual variables  to the analysis”.38 This problem can, however, be overcome by an examination  of the objects when the set of objects/the data is/are confined to a single item,  such as figurines, pottery, or lithics. We also address this concern with the final  output of the program, which makes the variables clearer by constructing a  “representative” item based on the attributes of the items in a given cluster.  Beside each attribute a number is given to indicate the likelihood that an ob- ject has a particular attribute in the identified group. The creation of the typologies used in this study follows a consistent proto- col. First, the two most similar objects are determined by the program based  on the number of shared attributes. For the sake of the computer analysis, each  qualitative attribute is given a number determining its presence or absence: 1  for present, 0 for not present and .5 for unclear. Then one sets a difference  parameter, that is, a number which defines the number of possible ways one  35 c++ is a popular object-oriented programming language based on the older c program- ming language. 36 In this volume see also Bigot Juloux (162–163), who proposes a qualitative approach for  text analysis. 37 For iterative process applied to text analysis, see in this volume, Monroe, 257, 266n25, 270. 38 Madsen 2007, &lt;http://www.archaeoinfo.dk/&gt; (accessed May 20, 2017), 2. </page> <page sequence="11"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  121 object can differ from another. This difference parameter will be set somewhat  arbitrarily at first, and then the program will be run multiple times with differ- ent values of the difference parameter to see how it affects the groups that are  formed. Comparing quantitative information such as diameter is done by sub- tracting numbers and taking the absolute value of the difference, so that num- bers like 12 cm and 12.75 cm are seen as .75 cm different from each other, so 3⁄4  of a difference parameter unit. This can lead to significant differences depend- ing on the units of the measurement (12 cm and 12.75 cm are .75 cm apart, but  also 7.5 mm apart), so an appropriate scaling weight can be used to adjust for  this. An alternative way to deal with quantitative data like this would be to  calculate the mean and standard deviation and replace one’s measurements  with the number of standard deviations they are from the mean, but this might  introduce other problems. These problems would appear particularly when  the underlying measurement data is not well fit by a Gaussian distribution (a  bell curve) that has a central peak, is evenly distributed about the mean, and  can be quantified with just the mean and the standard deviation (related to the  width of the bell curve). Therefore we would recommend using an appropriate  weight chosen based on the amount of variation in the data.  The two most similar objects are determined by finding how distant each  pair of objects is from one another in the multi-dimensional attribute space  using a metric. In this case we used the Manhattan metric for Boolean (for ex- ample, to indicate whether an attribute is present or not present) and qualita- tive data, which, as mentioned above, calculates distance by adding the  absolute values of the differences of each attribute, as well as the familiar Eu- clidean metric for quantitative data,39 which takes the square root of the sum  of the squares of the differences. In each case the value is scaled by the weight  that one assigned the attribute. One could choose a different metric, but one  advantage of a hierarchical clustering algorithm is that the choice of metric  does not particularly affect the results. At most it will change the difference  parameter necessary for different groups to appear. For example, imagine a  very simple dataset with one qualitative attribute, color, and two quantitative,  length and width. If we think the three attributes are equally important, the  weights would be equal. If we had three objects, one (red, 2 cm long, 3 cm  wide), another (blue, 5 cm long, 7 cm wide), and a third (red, 2 cm long, 7 cm  wide), the distance between the first two would be 1+√(32+42)=6, and the  distance between the first and the third would be 0+√(02+42)=4.  39 Euclidean metric: the square root of the sum of the squares of a difference, the distance  formula used in geometry. </page> <page sequence="12"> 122 Martino And Martino The two most similar objects form an initial core, and then one adds objects  to the first two to create a type’s core by adding all objects that differ from the  two original objects by no more than half the difference parameter. This forms  a distinct core of very similar objects for a group. Which objects are in the core  of a group is tracked, so that an object that is in the core of one group is not in  the core of any other group. We did this for two main reasons; one is purely  practical, but the other is much more important. The purely practical reason  for forcing the different cores to be distinct is that we wanted to make sure that  the program did not just identify the same group over and over again. Sec- ondly, and more importantly, this step reflects the belief that there are in fact  distinct related groups in any given dataset where a bit of overlap is under- standable (as will be shown in the next step), but the core defining aspects  (and objects) of a group should be distinct.  The group is then filled out by adding all objects that differ from the core by  no more than the total difference parameter, which can lead to overlap be- tween different groups. After this pass, we have one more pass that adds ob- jects that are within half of the difference parameter from any of the objects in  the group. These last two passes add objects to the group as members, but not  to the core, and so can be included in multiple groups. Then the group is com- plete, and the entire process is repeated until no two objects remain that are  similar enough to create a core. Once no more objects are left to form a core, a  final step is to get rid of groups that contain three or fewer objects, and then  see if the objects from those cores fit into any other groups. This was done just  to set a minimum size for a group, as a group that contains only two objects is  not very illustrative. That said, the choice that a group needs to have more than  three members is an arbitrary one that is easy to change. In the end there remained some figurines which were too difficult to place  into any single class, and thus they appeared in many groups. These are un- avoidable outliers that appear clearly in the program output. This is actually an  advantage of the program that is not typically found in typological analyses,  which often restrict an object to its appearance in only one group.40 In this  algorithm the only objects required to be in just one group are those that are  part of a group’s core. An obvious extension of the developed program that  would help, in particular, to analyze the figures that fit into more than one  group, would determine how well any given object fits into any given group,  much in the way that Hermon and Niccolucci used referees and “fuzzy set the- 40 Hermon and Niccolucci 2002, 217. </page> <page sequence="13"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  123 ory”—the idea that an object may be “in between” belonging and not belong- ing to a set—to examine the subjectivity of typologies.41  The order of appearance of a group in the output of the program indicates  the cohesiveness of a group, because the most similar pairs of objects are the  first to be identified. Thus every successive group is more diverse than the first,  giving the program user an indication of diversity as well as allowing them to  quickly examine various possible typological outcomes. The number of groups created when following this protocol is directly de- pendent upon the difference parameter. Objects in a group cannot differ from  at least one other object by more than the difference parameter. This does not  mean that all objects have the same shared attributes, but, rather, that a cluster  is formed by finding objects that are sufficiently close to the core in the space  of all possible attribute values. When the difference parameter is decreased,  objects will be more similar; when the difference parameter is increased, less  similar items will be placed together. It is the degree of similarity that creates  the groups, and, remarkably, for different values, there are distinct defined  groups. This is remarkable in that one might assume that this method would  result in the collection of all objects into the same group, and, for a high enough  value, this would happen. Even for a difference parameter as high as 12, as was  used with the figurines, however, not all fell into the same group. Another in- teresting consequence of looking at the groups formed with different differ- ence parameters is that subgroups can be identified inside larger groups, while  with a low difference parameter several groups are distinct; as the difference  parameter is increased, objects merge to form larger clusters. Finally, for figu- rines, especially ones as fragmentary as we had, we had to run three separate  sets in order to determine the best classes, one for the top, one for the middle,  and one for the bottom sections of each figurine.  The results were designed to be output from the program using unique  identifiers (id) for each object, so that those identifiers could then be searched  for in one’s database to easily identify groups,42 especially when the database  includes images or other additional identifying information. Along with the  list of objects found in each group, a list of average attributes is compiled so as  to better define and refine that group. Since we do not prohibit objects from  appearing in more than one group, using these average descriptors also has the  advantage of helping one to identify points of comparison with other classes  41 Hermon and Niccolucci 2002, 225. 42 Identifiers (ID) are simply unique numbers that do not have a specific meaning. Their  quality resides in their uniqueness.

In addition, these average attributes can  be created from either the complete class or just the core group. These average  attributes can also be used to determine which group any given object would  best fit into if it did not get assigned to any group originally. This can be done  by finding the distance between the representative objects and the objects of  interest; the distance between the average and the object is an indicator of  how well it would fit into that class. An alternative way of doing this is to calcu- late the distance between the object and each of the objects in the core of each  group, then divide that total distance by the number of objects in the core. This  method, however, is functionally equivalent to the other method. This list of average attributes also helps to validate the clustering procedure  by allowing one to compare the figurines that supposedly fit the cluster/group  to the list and see how closely they fit. Additionally, the percentage of figurines  in the cluster that can be associated with each attribute can be obtained, and a  threshold can be set for the number of attributes an object must have in order  to be included. The cluster can further be checked by the visualization of each  figurine within the cluster. We were able to do this easily because FileMaker  allows one to associate images with data and output them together. Such es- sential evaluative procedures were outlined by Mark Aldenderfer in his review  of cluster analyses as used by archaeologists. Those procedures were essential  to understanding the results of the analysis outlined below.43  Smaller Figurine Case Study For the comprehensive results of the program, one may look to Shannon Mar- tino’s dissertation,44 but for a more detailed analysis of the program’s applica- tion and the possibilities it affords through multiple analysis, this work must  focus on a small portion of the larger dataset. Because one of the most robust  local figurine studies is the work of Julia Obladen-Kauder at the site of Demirci- hüyük,45 these figurines were chosen as a case study. Demircihüyük is located in northwest Turkey near modern-day Eskişehir,  and although it has remains from the Neolithic to the second millennium bce,  the study detailed here was focused on the Early Bronze Age figurines from the  43 Aldenderfer 1982.  44 Martino 2012.

Manfred Korfmann directed excavations at the site between 1975 and 1978.  During the Early Bronze Age, the site had a cemetery as well as a settlement  and was radially planned with a circular layout of abutting, single-storied, trap- ezoidal buildings and a fortification wall with four gates.47 To determine the meaning of the Demircihüyük figurines, Obladen-Kauder  analyzed their form, details, and material. She believed that the figurines were  not obviously part of a cult or religion, stating that it is not compelling to con- clude either that the sexual characteristics of figurines were meant to be life- giving, or that they were assigned to a goddess or ritual.48 She insisted, rather,  that they must somehow be associated with femininity.   Unfortunately, the contexts of the figurines are not entirely clear. Of the ap- proximately 200 figurines found in the settlement, 116 come from secure con- texts, but little is known about those contexts except that 78 came from  interior courtyards, 23 come from the foremost rooms in a structure, and ten  come from the back room of one building presumed to be a domestic struc- ture.49  Additional figurines were found in the associated cemetery of Demir- cihüyük-Sarıket, in the graves of both adults and children.  Some of the graves  contained up to three figurines.50  Obladen-Kauder argues that the Demircihüyük figurines are a local devel- opment relying on three observations: there are a large numbers of figurines;  their stylistic development seems to take place locally without big jumps in  either form or decoration; and several stylistic types from surrounding areas  are combined in them.51 The results of the large-scale analysis confirms her  theory of the local development of the type, given that almost all of the figu- rines from the site fit into the same types. In addition, the subtypes within  those types are almost exclusively filled with figurines from Demircihüyük,  rather than from any of the more than 30 other sites examined in the study.52  When analyzing all the figurines in the corpus, the program divided the fig- urines from Demircihüyük into four major types. Most fit into what Shannon  Martino called “Class I” and “Class XIII” in her broader analysis of figurines  46 Korfmann and Kromer 1993, 139–140. 47 Korfmann 1983, 216–217, 242. 48 Obladen-Kauder 1996, 257–258. 49 Obladen-Kauder, 1996, 273. 50 Seeher 1992: fig. 7.3–4; Aydıngün 1999. 51 Obladen-Kauder 1996, 279. 52 Martino 2012. </page> <page sequence="16"> 126 Martino And Martino from the region. It is interesting to note that these figurines were distinguished  primarily by posture and the elaborateness of headdress. Class I will be the  focus of the analysis in this article. This is by far the largest of the classes, and  it is also the class about which more has been written than had been written  about almost any other, particularly those that are considered of the Violin Idol  type.53 Figurines in this class are characterized by a circular head, stump  arms, and either a semicircular bottom or articulated legs. The faces of each  figurine are distinguished by a nose shaped through pinching or modeling.  Slightly over 70% of the figurines from Demircihüyük are made from a fine  clay, and only 10% are unfired.54  Fifteen of the heads assigned to Class I come  from good contexts in layer H of Demircihüyük, placing them in the Early  Bronze I phase of the site.55  They are also concentrated in layers K1 and K2 and  L and M, which gives a rough end-of-use date of the beginning of Early Bronze  II.56  The attributes held most in common by figurines in this class are as fol- lows: Arms—Horizontal stumps  Back—Flat Back—Incision on back Back—X on back Breasts and chest—Intentionally absent Breasts and chest—X crossing torso Decorations—White paste Ears—Intentionally absent Eyes—Almond shaped Eyes—Horizontal slit Eyes—Dash eyebrows Eyes—Pupils Exterior color—Grey Face—Flat face Genitalia—Incised pubic area trapezoidal or square Genitalia—Pubic area Genitalia—Indented pubic area Hands—Intentionally absent 53 Makowski 2005, 14–15; Renfrew 1969, 9. 54 Obladen-Kauder 1996, 272, 274. 55 The only in situ complete figurine of this class was found in room 5 of phase F (Obladen- Kauder 1996, 272). 56 Obladen-Kauder 1996, 272. </page> <page sequence="17"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  127 Head—Almost flat vertically Head—Flat in back Mouth—Intentionally absent Nose—Intentionally absent nose Neck—Inward curve indication Neck—Round modeled Shoulder—Sloping Techniques and tools—Incision Techniques and tools—Indentation Torso—With curves Torso—Other incised decoration Techniques and tools—Incision Techniques and tools—Indentation Waist—Modeled waist The following is a description of the results of the computer analysis when just  the figurines from Demircihüyük were examined. Using a difference parame- ter of two on the figurines from the site of Demircihüyük, three bottom groups  are defined. Figure 4.2 indicates the members of one of the cores for the bot- toms that were defined.  When the difference parameter is increased to four, middle groups begin to  appear among the Demircihüyük assemblage (Fig. 4.3). Two top groups also appear at four, but these groups have only two figurines  in their core groups due to the increased diversity of the facial features. For  example, it is not until a difference parameter of eight that heads with a head- dress appear, and then only one version of them. This analysis shows that the  top sections are more diverse than the bottoms or middles in their design, es- pecially given that the number of attributes for the top, middle, and bottom are  similar at 85, 98, and 59, respectively. This means that the number of attributes  vary by less than a factor of two, but the difference parameter required to have  a group varies by a factor of three (See Appendix 4.2 for the attributes run for  this site listed by section of the body). Moreover, the number of possible attri- butes for the middle is slightly larger. Lastly, the number of members in a group  grows as one increases the difference parameter, allowing one to define sub- classes based on classes and to see how some classes blend into each other and  are more closely related than others.  One possible conclusion is that greater attention was given to, or license al- lowed, for the heads at Demircihüyük, especially for the facial features. The  results of the analysis suggest that the primary marker of this class for the bot- tom section is posture, for this distinguishes the classes from each other.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 128 Martino And Martino Though many subclasses appear as the difference parameter is decreased, as  the difference parameter is increased, these attributes quickly begin to become  irrelevant, while seated figurines remain in an entirely separate class.  Ceramics Case Study Just as with the figurines, the ceramic data from the western Anatolian site of  Demircihüyük, we thought, was worth pursuing because it had been robustly  published.57 In order to work with a smaller dataset, around 50 examples, the  case study was limited to the forms of cups and bowls from Early Bronze Age  levels H-M (Fig. 4.4).  These vessels varied in color from red to brown, both in terms of their slips  as well as their internal fabric colors.58 Their inclusions varied from fine to  large,59 from slate to fine clay with no inclusions to mention. The surface treat- ment varied from highly polished to unpolished. While such variety could have  afforded one with 100 attributes, the 11 attributes which were chosen for analy- sis were based not on a new assessment of the material, but, rather, on an anal- ysis of how Jürgen Seeher organized his cups and bowls into Forms. This was  done even though archaeologists sometimes classify pottery by the compo- nents of the clay firstly and by the form second (Appendix 4.3). Based on anal- ysis of the vessels’ descriptions within the text, as well as in the catalog, Seeher  seems to have created types based solely on form, to the exclusion of handle  types; decoration and fabric were not considered. Therefore, in the new analy- sis, information about the presence of a handle was weighted less than all the  other attributes. Our goal was to come up with the exact same groups, the ma- jor difficulty being that the Demircihüyük publication does not have entirely  consistent descriptions of the forms, so determining the attributes of each  form was difficult. For example, the images in Figure 4.5 are to scale, and what distinguishes  bowl from cup is not entirely clear, except that perhaps handles of the type  depicted may preclude pieces from being cups. Therefore, form 6 can have  such a horizontal handle, or it may not. Other problems include interp retations  57 Seeher 1988. 58 Slip: a mixture of clay and water poured or brushed onto the surface of pottery before  firing, used to create a smooth coating of possibly another color than that of the clay that  comprises the body of the vessel. 59 Inclusions: usually pieces of rock found deliberately or unintentionally mixed into the  clay of a vessel. </page> <page sequence="19"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  129 Figure 4.2  Example of core defined for Demircihüyük bottom section (images adapted from  Obladen-Kauder 1996: pls. 114.2–3, 114.5, 114.7, 115.3–5, 115.7–8) Figure 4.3  Example of core for Demircihüyük middle section (images adapted from Obladen- Kauder 1996: pls. 115.10, 116.3–2) </page> <page sequence="20"> 130 Martino And Martino Figure 4.4   All forms captured by analysis (images adapted from Seeher  1988) of the rim angle, which were difficult to make based only on drawings in a  book.

Given that, all the groups  were fairly consistent in the output.  At a difference parameter of four, the program output 11 valid groups. Six  groups were eliminated for being too small, so the group numbers go from 0 to  16. Table 4.1 represents groups that had some of the least correlation with See- her’s forms.

Of the 12  defined groups, five of them had at most only one extra member, i.e., all but  one vessel belonged to the same vessel form. The fifth and fifteenth groups  were composed of vessels of cup form 6 only. For the fifth group, vessels had an  average height of 6 cm, diameter of 15 cm, a height-to-diameter ratio of .4, and  a vertical rim and no handles. This too is consistent with Seeher’s description  of form 6. For the fifteenth group, the average height was 7.1 cm, diameter 18  cm, height-to-diameter ratio of .40, and an everted rim and no handles. The  eleventh group was composed of vessels mostly of cup form 7, with one of  form 6 with an average height of 6 cm, diameter of 17.25 cm, height-to-diame- ter ratio of 0.35, and an everted rim. Therefore, this group, too, is consistent  with Seeher’s analysis of form 7, but with a slightly larger average diameter  than the second group. Despite the fact that there is some overlap in the forms, the average descrip- tors of the forms as indicated by the program show that they are consistent  with the descriptions of the forms given by Seeher. It seems that where the re- sults do not exactly match Seeher’s forms, something has been missed from  </page> <page sequence="23"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  133 Seeher’s methodology to define forms, or too much or too little weight has  been given to a particular attribute. And, of course, as mentioned above, the  rim angle is difficult to determine from a book. A last note, none of the “bowls”  fit into a group until a difference parameter of 8, which seems to confirm the  validity of Seeher’s typological systems that placed no more than four bowls  into any one type and made them a more diverse lot. Ideally this study could  also be compared to an extensive reanalysis of the pottery from Demircihüyük.  Why This and Not Another? This program uses an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. It is ag- glomerative because all objects start in their own cluster, then get grouped to- gether as the program progresses. Another way that this could be done would  have been to put all objects into the same cluster to start with, then make cuts  and divide it into smaller and smaller clusters. In some sense, when the pro- gram is run with different difference parameters, one gets some of the aspects  of both methods; with high difference parameters one gets a few, large clusters,  and with low difference parameters, one gets many, small clusters. This is also  the sense of the word “hierarchical” here, as with varied difference parameters,  one gets a sense of how the different clusters are related to each other. Some  clusters are subclusters of other clusters, as is apparent when the difference  parameter is varied and the results analyzed. There are several advantages to the algorithm developed here. One is that  no assumptions need to be made about the distributions of the underlying  dataset. Using probabilistic methods, one must make assumptions (priors)  about the distributions of the different attributes amongst all the possible ob- jects; for example, a common distribution is the familiar Gaussian distribu- tion. This is a reasonable assumption, as many things tend to follow a Gaussian  distribution; for example cooking pots in a kitchen have an average size and  tend to vary consistently around the average size, with some above and some  below. If we considered all the plates in a house, though, the distribution would  be multimodal, with several peaks in frequency, for dessert plates, dinner  plates, and serving plates, each with its own corresponding bell curve. Differ- ent priors can be considered and optimized for the creation of groups, but no  such assumptions need to be made to use this method. The most similar con- cern this method introduces is in the choice of weights and attributes, but  these assumptions are explicit in the program. As mentioned above, another advantage of this hierarchical method is that  one can see how clusters are related to each other by looking at how they  </page> <page sequence="24"> 134 Martino And Martino change when the difference parameter is changed. Clusters formed with a  higher difference parameter tend to be more heterogeneous, and they frag- ment as the difference parameter is decreased. For particularly diverse datas- ets, those with many unique or uncommon attributes, the difference parameter  may need to be quite high before all the objects end up in the same cluster, but  this natural breakdown of cluster and subcluster—defined by lower effective  difference parameters—is one advantage of this algorithm. One more advantage of this method is that it is similar to the process that  would be followed by a person creating a typology, just significantly faster (as  an example, with a dataset of 2000 objects and 285 attributes, runtimes were in  the several-minutes range). Some multivariate analyses can be very opaque,  producing an output that does not explain how that output was achieved and  giving no direct understanding of what the output means. One example is the  work done by Bartel on figurines (1981) that made little mention of how they  program he developed actually worked. With the algorithm explained here,  one can easily output the cores of each cluster so that they can see the set of  objects that formed the basis of the cluster. In addition, because one can gen- erate representative objects for each cluster, one can determine, with some  certainty, why each object was placed in each cluster. The method is objective  in that it depends only on the attributes that have been chosen and the weights  that have been assigned. Varying the difference parameter and looking at the  resulting subclusters makes it more evident how each cluster was formed and  where it stands in relation to its subclusters and superclusters; the latter is de- fined by the largest effective difference parameter. This is information that  would be explicit to the scholar creating a traditional typology, though perhaps  not explicitly formulated in the publication of the data, and it is nearly as ex- plicit in this method.  Although it is an advantage to have complete personal control of these as- pects of the process, a major disadvantage relative to a traditional typology is  that while the program creates clusters and representative objects, and the  core of each cluster can be output, the actual importance of each attribute to  the cluster can be difficult to determine. A frequency analysis of the attributes  of objects in a cluster clarifies how many objects in a given cluster have an at- tribute, for example, but it cannot explain which attribute(s) were the neces- sary components of the cluster. One can infer this by looking at subclusters  and superclusters, as well as their representative objects, but, in a handmade  typology, one would have a complete understanding of why each type is the  way it is. The following is a pseudocode snippet of the program advocated here: </page> <page sequence="25"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  135 best = threshold; //60 The threshold is the difference parameter for this  run   for(i=0;i&lt;number of items;i++) //This loop runs through all of the  items in the dataset   for(j=i+1;j&lt;number of items;j++)    if (items i and j are not in a core of a group)        and (distance between      item i and item j)&lt;best then {         best = distance between item i and item j;        store i and j; }; //Now i and j are the two closest objects that are not already in the core of a  group set core of new group equal to items i and j; for(k=0;k&lt;number of items;k++)   if (distance between item k and items i and      j&lt;threshold)        add k to core of group; //Then the core of the group is complete, now add items that can be in  multiple groups for(k=0;k&lt;number of items;k++)   if(distance between k and any member of core    &lt;threshold) AND (k is not in the core of another        group)         add k to group; // Finally, one more pass of adding items to the group; these can be similar to  any member of the group, but they must be more similar than in the previous  step (the difference threshold is cut in half) for(k=0;k&lt;number of items;k++)   if(distance between k and any member of      group&lt;threshold/2) AND (k is not     in the core of another group)       add k to group; //Now the group is complete 60 “//”  indicates a descriptive comment and is not in the program itself. </page> <page sequence="26"> 136 Martino And Martino  Discussion The groups defined by the computer analysis are cohesive, but, as mentioned  earlier, there are outlier objects that tend to appear in all the groups, due to the  simplicity of their form or their uniqueness (often fewer than three examples  in the database). This situation is allowed in the analysis so as not to exclude  any object from a group simply because it has already appeared in another  group. This was made particularly clear in the large-scale analysis of the figu- rines. Such objects have to be dealt with on a case- by-case basis, and the re- sults of the analysis must be examined for clarity. Some objects can have too few attributes to be easily found by the program,  as extremely incomplete fragments will be distant from all other objects. Re- ally simple objects, even when complete, tend to be less distant from other  objects when the number of attributes is large. This is because when the num- ber of attributes is very large, most objects will not have most of the possible  attributes, so simple objects tend to appear in many groups. These, therefore,  ought not to be recognized as part of any group except the one in which they  are the predominant type.  If one does not collect consistent data, then the groups produced by the  program will not be consistent. That is to say, if one’s definition of “arm” varies  from object to object, then the results from the program will not be very useful.  Some missing information is unavoidable when working with fragmented  artifacts, but a lot of missing information means that one will have to do more  interpretation of the results. Others have addressed this problem of missing  information by limiting their variables.61 While this is a perfectly acceptable  solution, it does risk not recognizing significant distinctions between objects.  One way in which we tried to overcome this problem was by indicating when  it was unclear whether an attribute was present or absent, and also by indicat- ing positively when an attribute was not present. As stated above, we also ana- lyzed figurines in groups that accommodated the usual parts in which the  fragments are found, that is, head, torso, and lower body. Obviously, for differ- ent analyses different accommodations will have to be made. The types defined may not be the ones expected. This is when one finds out  if one “told” the program what was important, or if one left something out, or  if one told the program information that was not important, but that informa- tion defined groups anyway. A program’s ability to be flexible and to be run  quickly is thus essential to any typological analysis. 61 Gansell et al. 2014, 198. </page> <page sequence="27"> A Quantitative Method For The Creation Of Typologies  137 To use the program, all one needs is a set of attributes, a database of their  objects (that can be exported to csv format),62 and a set of weights that de- scribe how important each of the attributes will be in the formation of groups.  One must specify along with the weights whether the attributes are Boolean,  quantitative or qualitative, and one needs to specify an initial difference pa- rameter. All of these options are easy to change, and the program runs in min- utes for datasets of several thousand objects, so there is little risk in choosing  somewhat arbitrarily and then refining one’s parameters. Such options need to  exist because although this is a tool meant to remove subjectivity and ease the  understanding of large amounts of data, that data is best and properly under- stood by those who study it. You as a scholar understand the significance of  certain aspects of an object and the unavoidability or universality of others,  and you are the one to gather the data and therefore understand the meaning  of your descriptive terms. It is the responsibility of all scholars to gather data  well, both comprehensively and responsibly.   Appendix 4.1.
