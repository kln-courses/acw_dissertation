<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOREAU, MARX, AND THE "RIDDLE" OF ALIENATION BY JOHN P. DIGGINS JJ.ENRY David Thoreau told us what we needed to know in order to know what we do not need. No other social philosopher asked so much of man and demanded he do so little. Of nine- teenth century thinkers, perhaps only Nietzsche and Tolstoy would have understood what the American poet meant when he rejected Utopian socialism as "too practical/' The rest of us rub our eyes when we try to grasp his advice: more is worse. During Thoreau's lifetime Americans were, as Emerson re- marked, embarrassed by his presence. Today he has become a man for all persuasions. Among the counter-culture and the New Left, he has been resurrected as the patron saint of causes and the guru of cosmic consciousness; to civil rights advocates, the theorist of passive resistance; to militants, the spokesman for direct action; to ecologists, the bachelor of nature; to anarchists, the original "majority of one"; and to restless students, the inspiring teacher who walked out of the classroom and "got his head together" to become America's first drop-out. There is some truth in all these claims, but there is one claim that plays a trick upon the dead and distorts the whole meaning of his philosophy. In the Intellectual Origins of American Radi- calism, Staughton Lynd, a leading historian of the New Left, claims that Thoreau offered America a social analysis of aliena- tion that was essentially Marxist (or pre-Marxist). Lynd equates passages from Thoreau's "Life without Principle" with some from Marx's "On the Jewish Question," and he mixes quotes from the two authors in such a way as to make them seem identical. To demonstrate that Marx and Thoreau were in essential agreement about the human condition under capitalism, Lynd juxtaposes</page><page sequence="2">572 SOCIAL RESEARCH passages from Waiden and from Marx's Economic and Philo- sophic Manuscripts and exclaims, "The parallelism is uncanny!" Even the lyrical pastoralism of The German Ideology, Lynd tells us, was exactly what Thoreau was putting into practice at Waiden Pond. But above all, it is the common theme of alienation which enables Lynd to maintain that Thoreau and Marx "meant very much the same thing." Taking a familiar passage from Marx's early notebooks, Lynd claims that these words "might just as well have been Thoreau 's. What is alienated, for both Marx and Thoreau, is not only part of the workingman's product but the human capacities, energies, potentialities which should express themselves in joyful labor. As they saw it, the essence of man's oppression in 'civilized' society is that man's characteristic activ- ity, productivity, becomes (to use Marx's terms) 'self-sacrifice' and 'mortification' rather than (to use Thoreau's terms) a 'pastime.' " 1 These comparisons would be amusing if the contrasts were not appalling. Thoreau went to Waiden Pond in 1845, one year after Marx wrote his now-famous Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts. What drove Marx into meditation drove Thoreau into hiberna- tion. Both the American poet and the German philosopher were revolted by the moral sickness and self-delusion of bourgeois society. Yet while Marx and Thoreau addressed themselves to the same problems, they drew diametrically opposed conclusions. Thoreau could no more accept Marx's solution to the problem of alienation than Pascal could accept Voltaire's advice on happi- ness. Waiden is not the affirmation of the Economic and Philo- sophic Manuscripts - it is its refutation. To understand why Marx and Thoreau were speaking past each other, we must begin by asking the simplest and yet most perplexing question in social philosophy: why is man alienated? For Marx alienation originates in the historical development of private property and the division of labor.

Under capitalism, observed Marx, the worker experiences work not as creation but as coercion; and forced labor dehumanizes personal relationships because the introduction of the "alien intermediary" of money assumes all value and hence devaluates man. "What a contradiction it would be," confessed Marx, "if the more man subjugates nature through his work . . . man should renounce his joy in producing and the enjoyment of his product for love of these powers." In acquiring the power to conquer nature, how did man lose the power to master himself? "How, we ask now, does it happen that man externalizes his labor, alienates it? How is this alienation rooted in the nature of human development?" With the question dramatically posed, Marx continues, "Let us consider more clearly these relationships." At this point the manuscript breaks off - unfinished.2 Thoreau also wrestled with this very problem, but he did not leave the question unanswered. Indeed, Thoreau's whole life may be read as a mental odyssey into the deepest mysteries of human existence. Like Marx, Thoreau saw man as disjoined from his true nature, and he was also troubled by the knowledge that "money comes between man and his objects." Thus he asked one of his neighbors, Alex Therien, the Canadian woodchopper, if he thought man could live without this alienating medium. The woodchopper "showed the convenience of money in such a way as to suggest and coincide with the philosophical accounts of the origin of this institution, and the very derivation of the word pecunia. If an ox ivere his property, and he wished to get needles and thread at the store, he thought it would be incon- venient and impossible to go mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount. He could defend many insti- tutions better than any philosopher, because, in describing them as they concerned him, he gave the true reason for their prev- 2 Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy and Society, ed. by Loyd D. Easton and Kurt Guddat (New York, 1967), pp. 265-301.</page><page sequence="4">574 SOCIAL RESEARCH alence, and speculation had not suggested to him any other." 3 The woodchopper's behavior is one reason Thoreau would never make the nineteenth century radical transition from ideal- ism to materialism. When Marx turned Hegel "on his head," he transferred to the working class the regenerating activity of history that Hegel had located in "mind" and "spirit." The proletariat now became the historical agency of man's self-realiza- tion, for the active and producing man, not the abstract and theoretical man, is able to comprehend himself and the world and overcome alienation in the process of transforming nature. Thoreau's observations of his neighbor, however, led him to the opposite conclusion. The woodchopper is at once an intriguing and an enviable figure. Robust and cheerful, so "genuine and unsophisticated that no introduction would serve to introduce him," he was that rare human specimen, a creature of such moral beauty that he had to be experienced before he could be explained. "He inter- ested me," Thoreau tells us, "because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy withal; a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his eyes. His mirth was without alloy." But this "true Homeric or Paphlagonian man" also troubled Thoreau, who found it impossible to "know whether he was as wise as Shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a child, whether to suspect him of a fine poetic consciousness or stupidity." Physically vigor- ous and mentally alert, he questioned nothing and accepted everything. When a "distinguished wise man and a reformer" asked him if he did not want to see the world changed, the wood- chopper simply replied, "No, I like it well enough." This woodchopper, Thoreau concluded, could "never [be] edu- cated to the degrees of consciousness," for the "intellectual and what is called spiritual man in him were slumbering as in an infant." He could never challenge the existing order of things because as a worker he remained completely absorbed in the s Thoreau: Waiden and Other Essays, ed. by Joseph Wood Krutch (New York, 1962), p. 215.</page><page sequence="5">THOREAU, MARX AND ALIENATION 575 mundaneness of his own activity. When you are hoeing a field, he tells Thoreau, "you think of weeds'* - not new thoughts. In- stead of radically transforming himself and society through self- actualizing activity, the woodchopper merely accepted himself as he was and rationalized the necessity of all existing institutions. Lacking the inner freedom of the philosopher, he was unable to rise to consciousness; yet this man was psychologically intact and morally complete. Thoreau himself advised that a meeting with this fellow would suggest "many things to a philosopher." Alien- ated from his transcendental self and yet at home with his natural self, the woodchopper was, Thoreau confessed, "a metaphysical puzzle to me." 4 It will not do simply to dismiss the woodchopper as an example of the "happy unconsciousness" (to ironize Hegel) of innocent man and Thoreau's reflections as the "false consciousness" of idealist man. For Thoreau's life itself represents the expression in literature closest to Hegel's idea of freedom as "that voyage into the open where ... we stand in solitude with ourselves alone." 5 Nor can Thoreau's "metaphysical puzzle" be dismissed as the prototype of Herbert Marcuse's "one dimensional man" - a creature so alienated he is incapable of experiencing his own alienation. Something far more challenging is involved in a com- parison of Marx and Thoreau. Marx believed that the alienation of modern man could be overcome through free, self-expressing labor. Once liberated from the pressures of economic need, man could realize his true nature in autonomous, spontaneous, creative work. Why this is so has never been entirely clear, and in view of the unhappiness and alienation of sò many creative people, one finds no clue in Marx's cryptic declaration that the "positive transcendence of human alienation" is the "riddle of history solved and knows itself as this solution."6 From Thoreau's per- spective, there may be an ironic rub in Marx's unexplained 4/&amp;1U, pp. 211-217. e G.

If radical means "going to the root/' Marx only up- rooted the materialist premises of bourgeois individualism while leaving many of its metaphysical assumptions unchallenged. More specifically, Marx absorbed the ontological foundations of Protes- tantism and capitalism when he made work the center of man's being. And in doing so he offered economic solutions to philo- sophical problems. The difficulties in Marx's solution to alienation may be illus- trated by turning to the problem of community. To Marx, capi- talism was historically progressive, but it was a fateful, tragic necessity that shattered the intimate bonds of human community. Industrial capitalism brought not only soot and squalor but hu- man atomization, privatization, and fragmentation, reducing so- ciety to what Durkheim later called "a dust of individuals/' The disintegration of community resulted from both the division of labor by technological specialization and the distortion of labor by the commodity fetish. Man now began to experience "aliena- tion," "estrangement," "objectification," and "reification." As Daniel Bell and others have pointed out, there are important distinctions among these concepts, but it is the last-named that concerns us here, for it is in the experience of "reification" that man ceases to enjoy his own work and begins to desire the objects of another's labor. At this point human beings relate, not inti- mately to each other, but impersonally to each other's products. The "thingification" of life and the lust for property eventually turn man against man. "Our mutual value is the value of our mutual objects for us. Man himself, therefore, is mutually value- less for us," observed Marx.7 But how is this process to be re- versed? How can human community be restored? Convinced that the meaning and value of life must be found in work, Marx assumed that the abolition of property would end the "estrangement" of man from man and labor would again become "a free manifestation of life and an enjoyment of life." 8 * Ibid., p. 280. s Ibid., pp. 273, 281.</page><page sequence="7">THOREAU, MARX AND ALIENATION 577 It is still not clear, however, how the traditional duality of the individual and society would be overcome through the realization of "free human production." What is the nature of the social bond that will resolve the fragmentation of community? What is the ethical tie that will bind man to fellow man? Marx, of course, dismissed the classical problem of moral obligation, and thus the only principle he could fall back upon was the principle of pro- ductivity. The idea that the freely productive man would become the truly moral and social man is the answer he arrived at in his early notebooks: Suppose we had produced things as human beings: in his produc- tion each of us would have twice affirmed himself and the other. (1) In my production I would have objectified my individuality and its particularity, and in the course of the activity I would have enjoyed an individual life; in viewing the object I would have experienced the individual joy of knowing my personality as an objective, sensuously perceptible, and indubitable power. (2) In your satisfaction and your use of my product I would have had the direct and conscious satisfaction that my work satisfied a human need, that it objectified human nature, and that it created an object appropriate to the need of another human be- ing. (3) I would have been the mediator between you and the species and you would have experienced me as a reintegration of your self; I would have been affirmed in your thought as well as your love. (4) In my individual life I would have directly created your life; in my individual activity I would have immediately confirmed and realized my true human and social nature. Our productions would be so many mirrors reflecting our na- ture.9 Here is one of the noblest attempts to resolve the "lit" condi- tion of mankind and to create, without appealing to a transcen- dent faith, an "I-Thou" relation. The flaw in this formulation is that Marx, in conceiving man as dependent upon others, could easily make man subservient to others. To create "an object appropriate to the need of another human being" implies that the worker delivers up his products mainly to satisfy his own need for "affirmation." In Marx's analysis there is no suggestion that man could be drawn to fellow man simply out of love, affection, or friendship. Man must earn his self-affirmation, for men are » Ibid., p. 281.</page><page sequence="8">578 SOCIAL RESEARCH judged by what they do and not by what they are. Ironically, Marx scarcely recognizes what theologian Jonathan Edwards had earlier perceived as the ethical contradiction in the bourgeois concept of happiness and virtue: he who seeks the * 'approbation" and love of others may be doing so only out of "self-love." Simi- larly, the worker who exchanges his labor in return for "mutual" self-esteem may remain a creature of selfish interests. Thoreau, who observed that "Men and oxen exchange work," 10 clearly would have spotted the hook within the bait. He would have seen, for one thing, that Marx failed to transcend capitalist ethics when he confused value with the function of use and ex- change.11 In Marx's formulation man creates value in the objects he produces, but he finds his highest satisfaction only when he sees another person "make use of [his] product" in order to satisfy a "human need." The utilitarian logic of capitalism sneaks back into Marx's analysis, for a product that is made to satisfy others loses its own intrinsic worth. No writer examined more exhaustively than Thoreau the "present mode of living" in nineteenth century America, and no one was more keenly aware of the crucial distinction between "living" and "getting a living." Significantly, Thoreau's philos- ophy of work rejects mutual dependency for self-sufficiency. "The aim of the laborer should not be to get his living, to get 'a good job/ but to perform well a certain work." 12 The test of genuine work is a matter of self-performance, an autonomous exercise that challenges the Marxist idea that there could be a harmonious com- munity of workers. When Thoreau discussed the products of his work, he deliberately "studied . . . how to avoid the necessity of selling them." 13 Man must never gear his efforts to the de- mands and needs of others, for the "services" others desire are 10 Waiden and Other Essays, op. cit., p. 147. ii Marx, of course, distinguished between use and exchange value, one relating to production, the other to distribution. But as the following analysis indicates, the distinction breaks down. 12 "Life without Principle," in Waiden and Other Essays, p. 358. is Waiden, p. 119.</page><page sequence="9">THOREAU, MARX AND ALIENATION 579 "the most disagreeable to render." 14 That one should esteem his work apart from society is not a matter of individual selfish- ness; on the contrary, it is the principled life of the lonely stoic. Even while engaging in the mundane task of making pencils, Thoreau denied that his work should have social value and com- mand remuneration. "That the other world is all of my art; my pencils will draw no other; my jack-knife will cut nothing else; I do not use it as a means/' 15 Thoreau believed with Marx that man is the source of value, but for Thoreau the relationship between man and his work had its highest expression in the life of the artist. The true artist is completely sovereign, responsible only to the dictates of con- science and the impulses of imagination. The worker can ap- proach artistic freedom only to the extent that he works for himself and family alone. "Who knows," Thoreau speculated, "but if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands, and provided food for themselves and families simply and honestly enough, the poetic faculty would be universally developed, as birds universally sing when they are so engaged." 16 But how to reconcile the "laws of beauty" to the needs of society? As artist and poet, Thoreau recognized the tension between aesthetics and ethics, and he never confused the felicity of the creative act with the utility of the social act. His answer to the division of labor was to make every laborer a "self-supporting" poet who "must sustain his body by his poetry." And from society the "poet must keep himself unstained and aloof." In his autobiographical poem, "The Fisher's Son," Thoreau likened his life to a stroll upon a desolate beach where he worked in total isolation. His aesthetic idea of work, instead of drawing him closer to others, set him i*"Life without Principle," op. cit., p. 357. is Henry David Thoreau, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (Boston, Sentry edn., n.d.), p. xix. io Waiden, p. 139. Marx, in an euphoric moment, also hoped that man ulti- mately would become like an artist who "knows how to apply everywhere the in- herent standard of the object" and "form things in accordance with the laws of beauty" (quoted in Robert Tucker, Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx (London, 1967), p. 134).</page><page sequence="10">580 SOCIAL RESEARCH further apart from the mass of men who look upon work as mere doing and making: My neighbors sometimes come with lumbering carts, As if they wished my pleasant toil to share, But straightaway go again to distant marts For weeds and ballast are their care.17 Preferring solitary existence to social solidarity, Thoreau rejected emphatically the notion that we "should get our living together/9 Even the idea of cooperation seemed a snare and a delusion. "The only cooperation which is commonly possible is exceedingly par- tial and superficial; and what little true cooperation there is, is as if it were not, being a harmony inaudible to man." 18 Man hears but faintly the melody attracting him to other men. This inaudible harmony was simply friendship, the hidden law of human sympathy which flows from the heart and not the will. In A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers one may find the most eloquent statement in American literature on the idea of friendship - an idea which must be expressed, Thoreau says, in the language not of words but of meanings. His experiences with rugged lumbermen, boisterous Irish laborers, and untamed Indians led him to reflect on the joys of fraternal happiness. Friendship, "a relation of perfect equality," is "evanescent in every man's experience," and when actualized it "purifies the air like electricity." But Thoreau also sensed that this most beautiful of man's natural impulses could easily be corrupted by social institutions and by human nature itself: by Christianity, which reduces friendship to condescending charity; by commerce, which reduces it to "cheap honesty"; by neighborliness, which reduces it to "cheap civility"; and by man's false need for "appreciation," which reduces it to a continual craving for "proof of our affec- tion." Friendship remained for Thoreau a sublime experience more sensed than understood. True friendship, he suggests, con- sists in the lofty and pure ideas men have about one another. Friends are best honored in thought rather than in deed, and 17 Collected Poems of Henry Thoreau, ed. by Carl Bode (Baltimore, 1965) , p. 122. is Waiden, pp. 158-159.</page><page sequence="11">THOREAU, MARX AND ALIENATION 581 "When they say farewell, then indeed we begin to keep them company/' There is a disturbing paradox in Thoreau's concept of friendship: the more men really love each other, the less they need each other.19 Thoreau's discussions of friendship were so rarefied, so per- versely abstract, that he himself must have dreaded any form of human commitment.20 Hence the problem of ethics, of social obligation and political responsibility, remains unresolved in Thoreau's thought as well as in Marx's. The former desired to transcend society, the latter to transform it. Whatever the strategy, Thoreau likewise failed to reconstruct a concept of community that would end the increasing isolation and emotional privation of the individual. His strategy of disassociation may have been designed to make man unfit for society, but it also rendered his ideas unfit for social philosophy. For Thoreau's radical individ- ualism does not implicate personal life in the functioning of civic life. Obsessed with his own salvation, Thoreau called upon others to withdraw from society and thereby become oblivious to all that is general and public. His tactics of dissent, disobedience, and disengagement are valuable resources in an "open" society; yet they represent not so much a systematic social philosophy as a spontaneous moral position. And in striving for such a position, Thoreau seems to fall victim to the same sin of "intellectual pride" that Hawthorne in the nineteenth century attributed to the Transcendentalists and Reinhold Niebuhr in our time to the Marxists. The Promethean quest that drove Marx to rise up against God and identify his own desires with the course of history is no more arrogant than Thoreau's conceit in claiming for him- self a "conscience" so pure that no social demand dare disturb it. There are other limitations to Thoreau's social philosophy. For one thing, his anarcho-individualism expresses the anti-insti- tutional bias that did so much to weaken early nineteenth century 19 A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, op. cit., pp. 275-307. 20 This point is made with wit and insight by Perry Miller, Consciousness in Concord: The Text of Thoreau's Hitherto "Lost Journal" (1840-1841) (Boston, 1958), pp. 80-103.</page><page sequence="12">582 SOCIAL RESEARCH reform movements. Along with Emerson and other Transcenden- talists, Thoreau refused to take part in the abolitionist campaign against slavery. The romantic idealism of the 1830's represented the first of a series of examples in American intellectual history when a radical school of thought failed to incorporate its ideas into an organized movement. This failure to carry philosophical thought over into the field of collective action would probably be regarded by Marx as a form of social alienation. In the strug- gle to liberate mankind, Marx advised, the "proletariat" would be at the "heart" of the movement but "philosophy" would be its "head." Here the defects of Thoreau's position become even more apparent. Innocent of the nature of power, ignorant of the realities of social change, and indifferent at times to the spectacle of human suffering, the American poet chose to interpret the world rather than to change it, to renounce the evils of indus*- trialism rather than to help abolish them or bring them under control. Moreover, Thoreau's defiant stance lacks any sensibility to the needs for social authority and human intercourse. Marx may have been unsuccessful in reconciling human productivity to social community, but Thoreau appears even more inadequate in his assertion that man need recognize no authority outside of himself as he proceeds upon the joyous adventure of "signing off" from all institutions. Without some discriminate hope in the possi- bility of legitimate authority, and some measure of social disci- pline, Thoreau's philosophy can easily degenerate into a riot of egoism in which "doing your own thing" turns every self into a sovereign. Thus in arguing for the supreme importance of the individual, Thoreau slighted not only the value of community but the deeper need of belonging to and participating in public and social life, perhaps the one "school" in which man learns that true human development depends upon the presence of others. All this suggests that we must avoid the temptation of setting up Thoreau as a foil to Marx. Neither offered a satisfactory solution to the problem of community. Marx's magnificent attempt to</page><page sequence="13">THOREAU, MARX AND ALIENATION 583 realize man's social nature may be unconvincing, but Thoreau's effort to deny it is uninspiring. Whatever the shortcomings of Thoreau's social philosophy, in intellectual history Waiden stands somewhere between Das Kapi- tal and the Wealth of Nations like an awkward question mark. For its author denied that either the mutual exchange of "need" satisfaction or the harmony of "interests" could serve to realize genuine community and fraternity. Yet if man does not need fellow man to "affirm" his own nature, what enables him to over- come his alienation? The answer to this question makes the contrast between Marx and Thoreau complete. For Marx the answer is work. Admittedly Marx's attitudes toward work are equivocal and ambivalent. Often he rhapsodizes about human exertion; occasionally, as in The German Ideology, he contrasts work with a pastoral life of leisure. Nor are the dif- ferent meanings of "work" and "labor" clear in Marx's thought, as Hannah Arendt has so astutely pointed out.21 Nevertheless, for Marx work takes on metaphysical meaning. Man as homo faber is both cause and effect, a maker of history and a product of his- tory. In Marx's philosophy of praxis, to think is to act, and to produce is to know the world by transforming it. Labor is the specific agency that shapes the world, thereby enabling man to overcome alienation by realizing his subjective nature in the ex- ternal objects he produces. Man as creator determines his essence in his creative activity. Moreover, work brings man into direct contact with nature, and as man extends his sphere of productive activity to include larger parts of nature, the external world is humanized and man naturalized. So reconciled, Marx's synthesis of "humanism" and "naturalism" supposedly overcomes the dual- ism of man and nature.22 Marx's solution to human alienation would have chilled Thoreau to the bone. In Thoreau's eyes work does not serve to mediate between man and nature; rather it divorces man from the 21 Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition (Garden City, N. Y., Anchor edn.), pp. 72-153. 22 Writings of the Young Marx, pp. 303-306.</page><page sequence="14">584 SOCIAL RESEARCH unity and harmony of the natural world. For work implies that man must assault nature, subdue her, and wrest value from her. The pride of work is the pleasure of feeling triumphant over the resistance of the external world. Thus for Thoreau, "a man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone." 23 Moreover, since work means mastery, and since its very meaning drives man toward achievement, work enslaves man to the artificial pressures of time. Thoreau could find delight in physical labor, but the kinds of deeds he described with relish were the passive activities that transcended time and left nature seemingly undisturbed: fishing, the keeping of bees, and picking huckleberries. Unlike Marx, Thoreau denied that productivity was the essence of human nature, and thus nothing would have been more repugnant to him than Marx's declaration that "our productions would be so many mirrors reflecting our nature." As a man who grew his own food and constructed his own dwell- ing, Thoreau could not help but be engaged in what he quaintly called "agricola laboriosus." Yet he was less interested in growing beans than in becoming "intimate" with them as symbols of higher truths. As though he were responding to Feuerbach's dictum that "Man is what he eats," Thoreau tells us that he "was determined to know beans," not merely to "eat" them. And be- fore the day had ended "It was no longer beans that I hoed, nor I that hoed beans," reflected the poet as he communed with na- ture, oblivious to the passing of time, lost in the stillness of pure thought. With the renunciation of work, Henry Thoreau is in a different philosophical world from that of Karl Marx. From Hegel Marx took over the idea that man could liberate himself from alienation through work. In so doing Marx transformed an ontological problem in metaphysics and grounded it in human history and political economy. For Thoreau, however, alienation is not the inability of man to realize his genuine nature in labor; it is the failure of man to nourish his selfhood by turning inward and 23 Waiden, p. 166.</page><page sequence="15">THOREAU, MARX AND ALIENATION 585 cultivating higher stages of consciousness. The dynamic of "nega- tion" and "positive transcendence" which Marx located in "prac- tical, human sensuous activity," Thoreau located in the "power of abstract thought." 24 The writings of the American poet warn man to "abstain from action," to reflect upon the self and to think about thinking. Whereas Marx regarded consciousness as a con- ditioned "social product," Thoreau regarded it as a cerebral state possessing an inner life of its own, the highest reach of mind in which "thought begat thought." 25 Only in self-dialogue could the ego be transcended and alienation overcome. To realize this state of "mental ecstasy," Thoreau turned away from New Eng- land, where "our vision does not penetrate to the surface of things," and gazed east to India, where one glimpses the supreme truth. "In the morning I bathed my intellect in the stupendous and cosmological philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta. ... I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Bramin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. The pure Waiden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges." 26 There is in Thoreau's reflections a suggestion that Pascal and Freud would have appreciated - and perhaps also such disparate modern minds as Norman O. Brown, André Malraux, and the late Thomas Mer ton: this is the terrible secret that work may be a neurotic activity intended to divert the mind from the diminu- tion of time and the approach of death. Implicit also in Marx is the suggestion that through praxis man renders his existence con- crete and stable by creating objects of permanence. But Marx could scarcely acknowledge that work, man's deepest need ("not only a means of life but life's prime want"), had its psychic origins in the painful fear of death and the metaphysical dread 24 Writings of the Young Marx, p. 401; Waiden, p. 147. 25 The Writings of Henry David Thoreau, 20 Vols.

Thoreau sensed that the desperation of activist man lies in his vain struggle to stay ahead of time by engaging in death-defying works. Thus with Hegel he desired to melt the past and future into the continuous and eternal present. "That man, who'er he is/Lives but a moral death/Whose life is not coeval /With his breath/' 27 Still, the American poet would never be able to accept the Hegelian-Marxist proposition that action and labor enable man to overcome the terrors of his transitory existence. For work, whether a coercive burden or a creative freedom, introduces the element of time into man's thoughts, making him "clever" and "calculating" and forcing him to settle for a life of "simple expediency." The person who labors in the material world works within an imposed dimension of time alien to his being. And since time becomes the ruling logic of man's "mastery" of nature, it freezes life at the material level of exis- tence. Precisely because he is a doer and maker, productive man is incapable of defying time and overcoming alienation. Thus Thoreau's idea of transcendence reverses the ontological sequence of Hegel and Marx. In Thoreau's vision of self-realization, as described in his portrait of the Indian artist of Kouroo, action gives rise to thought and introspection, and as thinking man takes leave of the material world, both time and age are conquered. The western idea of work nurtures the practical intelligence of man at the cost of stunting his philosophical nature. What Santayana said about Americans Thoreau said about workers in general: they think of themselves as idealists working upon mat- ter. The assumption that the dualism between mind and matter can be transcended though work may be the illusion of the social- ist as well as the capitalist.

In Thoreau's eyes the rela- tionship between production and possession is as diabolical as it is dialectical, for if man objectifies his subjective nature in the objects he produces, he also surrenders himself to those objects. To perceive is to know, and as man sees with the "inner eye" of intuition so shall he be: the woodchopper remains a creature of doing who could never rise to knowing because, instead of elevating his thoughts beyond the material categories of work, he became preoccupied with the fruits of his labor. The working man works not to know truth but to make things, and so the very objects he produces come to possess him. The only way out of this dilemma of "reification" is to redefine the nature of man. And this is precisely what Marx failed to do. "By producing food," Marx asserted, "man indirectly produces his material life itself," and what men are "coincides with what they produce . . . and how they produce." 29 By confining his definition to "what" and "how" and ignoring completely the question "why," Marx confined his definition of human nature to Locke's and Adam Smith's idea of man as animal laborans. Thoreau, anticipating Veblen, perceived that what men produce they also destroy. The poet was "determined to know beans" because he was determined to comprehend his nature by asking the metaphysical "why." He refrained from harvesting and eating his beans because he did not wish to "externalize" his nature by projecting it upon the objects he produced and destroy them in the act of consumption. It is transcendental man, Emerson's "man thinking," who can expose the tautological conceit between the producing subject and the consuming object. The "heroic joy" of contemplative man is that he can rise above "reification" be- cause he, and only he, can remain indifferent to the consequences of labor.

First of all, one cannot help but notice the logi- cal fallacy of identity - the assumption that a cause must resemble its effects. Assuming that social effects derive from social causes, Marx regarded the consequences of alienation and the causes of alienation as one and the same. Indeed, cause and effect are seen dialectically as two forces which are at the same time themselves and each other. Only one who equated a condition with a cause would be able to proclaim that "The overcoming (Aufhebung) of self-alienation follows the same course as self-alienation." 31 That the means of man's dehumanization - the productive forces of history - would also serve as the means of man's rehumaniza- tion may be the liquefied logic of the dialectic. But Thoreau, the most Yankee of mystics, would never allow a contradiction to be hidden within a contradiction. In his anti-utopian essay, "Para- disc (To Be) Regained" (1843), the poet insisted that the means of self-transcendence do not lie within the condition of self-alien- ation. "True, this is the condition of our workmen, but it could never be the means of our recovery." M Marx's analysis also suffers from naturalistic reductionism. Not only did he reduce all knowledge to the realm of action, he re- duced basic human and moral problems to the forces of nature. There is an embarrassing irony in this "naturalistic fallacy" which Thoreau, the greatest of naturalists, would clearly have perceived. Marx claimed, for example, that the phenomenon of "pbjectifica- 30 Waiden, p. 228. 3i Writings of the Young Marx, p. 301. 32 Henry David Thoreau, "Paradise (To Be) Regained," in Thoreau: People, Principles, and Politics, ed. by Milton Meltzer (New York, 1963), p. 22. This essay, a book review of an Utopian proposal based upon the liberating powers of indus- trialism, may be read as a brilliant critique of both Marxism and capitalism. Ob- serving that the productive knowledge of industrial man yielded a "truth" without "ethical form," Thoreau doubted that there could ever be "a transcendentalism in mechanics as well as ethics" (p. 10).</page><page sequence="19">THOREAU, MARX AND ALIENATION 589 tion" and "reification" was characteristic of alienated man, who rightly objectifies his natural powers in labor and then wrongly reifies those powers by creating institutions which come to possess laws independent of man's desires. Could it not also be said that Marx himself slipped into this habit of thinking when he attrib- uted to the objective, "natural" forces of history the subjective powers and ideas of man? Alienated man accepted the existing social order as "given by nature," but Marx accepted the "stages," "laws," and "tendencies" of history as "given" in the nature of historical development. In either case man's moral freedom is severely restricted. True, what remained to liberate man and "negate" the given world were the supposedly self-generating powers of human production. Yet the hope that man could "pro- duce" his way out of the very condition he had produced himself into only deepens the irony. For when Marx reduced all reflec- tive knowledge to productive knowledge he left man in a theoret- ical double bind. In describing the condition of alienation, Marx denied man the capacity for genuine self-consciousness; and in objectifying the subjective, ethical dimension of history, he de- nied man the capacity for moral transformation as a means of overcoming his self-alienation. Self-consciousness had yet to be freed from objective illusion; 33 or, as Thoreau might have put it, moral man had yet to be born. It is precisely this dimension of moral consciousness that Tho- reau was attempting to awaken in man. And to do so he had to demonstrate, above all else, the vanity of action and the futility of production. Thoreau's idea of alienation is simply human "meanness," man's inability to transcend his own egoism; his ideal man was "the Good Adam contemplating his own virtue." 34 Since virtue inheres only in a state of consciousness, ethical thought must precede social action. "Action from principle, the perception and the performance of right, changes things and rela- tions ... it divides the individual, separating the diabolical in 33 A point made effectively by Jürgen Habermas, Knowledge and Human In- terests (Boston, 1971), pp. 43-63. s* Waiden, p. 349.</page><page sequence="20">590 SOCIAL RESEARCH him from the divine. " 35 Marx, of course, refused to believe that the overcoming of alienation required the moral reorientation of man. The inner moral tension of the "diabolical" against the "divine" found its dramatization in capital against labor. With the eventual triumph of the working class, self-transcendence would become possible without ethical struggle. For Marx the "riddle" of history had been solved; for Thoreau it had been obscured. If Marx's account of alienation lacks ethical dimension, it also lacks aesthetic precision. Ultimately what renders Marx's account dubious is the absence of a convincing picture of unalienated man. Marx describes man as a "species-being" who is forever in the "process" of becoming, forever making and transforming him- self. Yet there is no historical description, however sketchy, of the condition of man prior to alienation, a sense of the ideal from which man has fallen. Nor is there any normative description, however speculative, of the ideal state toward which alienated man is striving to realize his full nature. In Marx's history both paradise lost ("primitive communism") and paradise regained ("completed communism") are remote, vague, reference poles at the opposite ends of a strife-ridden continuum. Marx, it is true, speaks of the stage beyond "crude communism" as that future, propertyless state when man experiences "the reintegration or return of man to himself," when he achieves "the actual appropriation of the human essence through and for man," and when he realizes "the restoration of man as a social, that is, human being," 36 but these expressions remain, as Thoreau might have put it, mere verbal abstractions without human content. Reading Marx's vague, his- toriosophical expectations of post-capitalist life, we are reminded of Aristotle's thesis that only poetry conveys truth by concrete example. For we must be able to at least glimpse the mind and life of unalienated man, otherwise what standard can we use to condemn alienated existence?

Once again we must turn to Thoreau. The American poet could envision and experience unalienated human nature because he, unlike Marx, regarded the individual as a particular essence that could be known and appreciated apart from the whole (indeed one is tempted to say that although Marx talked about history as the study of "real, living" people, it was Thoreau who allowed them to enter his books).37 Society, Thoreau realized, has distorted and disfigured man, but not all men. And the poet asks us to share in the excitement of coming upon the complete human being, men like Cyrus Hubbard, George Minott, Reuben Rice, Sam Melvin, and the other richly pungent charac- ters who populate his Journals. Wiser than "professors," these simple farmers, hunters, and stone cutters had reduced life to its rawest essentials and thereby elevated their "souls." Such men work "slowly but surely, enjoying the sweet of it," "keep" time by observing "the hours of the universe," and follow Thoreau in "relinquishing" the harvest whenever labor threatens to be- come acquisitive and prevents man from going "a-fishing or a-bee- hunting or a-rifle-shooting." 38 Lest one sense in these descriptions a faint echo of the pastoral- ism in Marx's The German Ideology, it is necessary to stress that the mode of work Thoreau advocated amounted to a leisurely "sport" or "pastime" that was content with "conserving the world." 39 Work for Thoreau is not a compulsive behavior driv- 37 Yet we must accept Thoreau's description of characters with skepticism just as we must accept Marx's description of classes with caution. As Thomas Woodson points out, Thoreau lacked "the novelist's respect for the otherness of other people." Hence Whitman was "right," Woodson notes, "in telling Träubel that 'Thoreau had an abstraction about man - a right abstraction,' but one which kept him from a broader sympathy with 'the men we meet here, there, everywhere - the concrete man.' " (Thomas Woodson, "Thoreau on Poverty and Magnanimity," PMLA, Vol. 85, #1 (January, 1970) pp. 21-34.) In romanticizing unique characters and ignor- ing the average man, Thoreau commits the opposite error of Marx, who idealized the masses and ignored the individual. 38 Thoreau: People, Principles, and Politics, op. cit., pp. 77, 127. &amp;*lbid., p. 74.</page><page sequence="22">592 SOCIAL RESEARCH ing man to transform the world by acting upon nature through "industry," which Marx called, in a moment of technological rapture, "the open book of man's essential powers." 40 If Thoreau ever became excited about work it was not because of its "powers" but its aesthetic possibilities. His admirable laborers are not born to produce and consume in a life of ceaseless and sterile activity. Instead they seem to know instinctively the difference between being and becoming and they know that the way to live is simply to "be." ("We must heap up a great pile of doing for a small diameter of being.") His neighbor Minott, "perhaps the most poetical farmer," does not need Thoreau; "he has been there," the author states apocryphally, referring to Waiden Pond. Hubbard is "a redeemer for me," because he is "moderate, natu- ral, true, as if he were made of earth, stone, wood, snow." 41 At harmony with nature, they were at one with themselves because they labored only to fulfill their most irreducible needs. In these figures we at last discover models of the dignity and excellence of unalienated man. Rather than "pursue" happiness, they em- body it. How was it possible for Thoreau to find unalienated men in an alienating society? The answer would appear to be that Thoreau's noble workmen practice a total and uncompromising indepen- dence in economic life just as the artist practices an absolute and unmitigated autonomy in creative life. In a phrase, the solution to the division of labor is self-reliance. Marx has never been able to explain even to his followers exactly how the division of labor would be solved by industrial socialism. For Thoreau there simply is no solution since industrialism merely represents the division of labor writ large. Parceling out the tasks of work not only introduces exchange value and stimulates the desire for things, it also fragments the essential unity of man's nature. Yet modern man plunges ahead with his eyes wide open.

And now the result of this downward course will be seen in that book, which should be the ultimate fruit of the huckleberry-field and account for the existence of the two professors who came between D and A. It will be worthless. There will be none of the huckle- berry in it. The reading of it will be a weariness to the flesh. To use a homely illustration, this is to save at the spile but waste at the bung. I believe in a different kind of division of labor, and that Professor D should divide himself between the library and the huckleberry-field. I was suggesting once to a man who was wincing under some of the consequences of our loose and expensive way of living, "But you might raise all your own potatoes, etc. etc." We had often done it at our house and had some to sell. At which he demurring, I said, setting it high, "You could raise twenty bushels even/' "But," said he, "I use thirty-five." "How large is your family?" "A wife and three infant children." This was the real family; I need not enumerate those who were hired to help eat the potatoes and waste them. So he had to hire a man to raise his potatoes. Thus men invite the devil in at every angle and then prate about the garden of Eden and the fall of man.42 Thoreau had no "practical" solution to the division of labor, and eventually he himself would begrudgingly accept such indus- trial "advances" as the railroad and the telegraph system. But as poet and moralist he dwelled on the impossible in spite of the inevitable. His probing observations are essentially metaphysical in nature, and the critical sting of his mind forces us to return again to our original question: why is man alienated? Why does man willingly initiate the division of labor and introduce money, thereby bringing self-contradiction into his own existence and into his relations with fellow men? Marx, as we saw, gave up searching for the primal cause of alienation. Indeed this ques- « Waiden, p. 139; Thoreau: People, Principles, and Politics, p. 126.</page><page sequence="24">594 SOCIAL RESEARCH tion has never seemed to trouble socialists. The entire tradition of Marxist thought has ignored the question by treating man and history as a dialectical process, in which a fundamental para- dox is turned into a truism by Hegel's magical "negation of the negation." To those outside the Hegelian-Marxist tradition the paradox continues to haunt the mind like a metaphysical nightmare. Why does man "externalize" his nature? If man is the source of his being, whence the estrangement of his essence? If man makes himself, why does he alienate himself? When we turn to Thoreau's answer we begin to sense how insufficiently radical is the Marxist explanation. For Thoreau suggests that man alienates himself when he gives himself over completely to the life of labor, assum- ing he can find himself in work rather than in thought. Ulti- mately it is only through contemplation that transcendental man bethinks himself and tries to recover his pre-alienated wholeness. Here it is Marx who follows the Protestant tradition of urging man to seek in labor what had been lost in life. Marx opposed the ethic of capitalism only to absorb its ethos. He asked man not to question the meaning of his life but to expand his "powers" by heeding the lessons in the "open book" of industrialism. With Thoreau there is no appeal to industrial power and action. In- stead man is asked to reduce his needs and simplify his desires, for indeed, work may be the new opiate of the masses. The cult of work is the cunning source of alienation, leading man to "want something to do" when man's deepest need is for "something to ber 48 To make explicit the ontological distinction between doing and being, Thoreau ultimately turns to the East, where truth is "seen" and not "made," and to the American Indian, the only man capable of "intercourse with nature." It is to western man, the animal laborans of both the Marxist and the capitalist traditions, that Thoreau exclaims: Behold the difference between the Oriental and the Occidental. 43 Waiden, p. 122.</page><page sequence="25">THOREAU, MARX AND ALIENATION 595 The former has nothing to do in this world; the latter is full of activity. The one looks in the sun till his eyes are put out; the other follows him prone in his westward course. There is such a thing as caste, even in the West; but it is comparatively faint; it is conservatism here. It says, forsake not your calling, outrage no institution, use no violence, rend no bonds; the State is thy parent. Its virtue or manhood is wholly filial. There is a struggle between the Oriental and the Occidental in every nation; some who would be forever contemplating the sun, and some who are hastening toward the sunset. The former class says to the latter, When you have reached the sunset, you will be no nearer the sun.44 But when we have reached the core of Thoreau's philosophy, are we any nearer to a solution to alienation? Does pure thinking, knowledge knowing itself, enable man to overcome self-estrange- ment? The answer is by no means clear. The whole tradition of western literature, from Shakespeare to Eugene O'Neill and from Goethe to T. S. Eliot, dramatizes a mind that is tragically divided within itself, a mind cursed by a finite imagination driven by an infinite desire for meaning. Working man may come to be possessed by the things he produces, but thinking man may also be enslaved by the ideas he projects. Thought as well as action can be divisive, making so many distinctions that mind becomes separated from object, idea severed from action, and man alien- ated from the world about which he thinks. (Even Thoreau would have to concede that the woodchopper was more "at home" in the world than Hamlet.) As for "happiness" - an old fashioned word for unalienated existence - we might well ask whether it is to be found in the qualities of mind or in the mysteries of char- acter. Thoreau embraced thought in order to meditate on the sublime experience of happiness. Others embrace it only to des- pair about the anxieties of existence. When asked what his vast learning and reflection meant to him, Max Weber replied: "I want to see how much I can endure." Other doubts begin to arise when one examines the epistemo- logical premises and ethical consequences in Thoreau's social phi- losophy. Thoreau's individualism kept him aloof from organized "ibid., p. 147.</page><page sequence="26">596 SOCIAL RESEARCH political movements, but his Transcendentalist belief in the primacy of self-regeneration resulted in a contemplative escape from life to art. Like Emerson, Thoreau was more concerned about the effects of reform upon the reformer than upon the re- formed. This disposition made the whole subject of human progress not a politics of social transformation but an anti-politics of solipsism. Since feeling determines reality, the poor and op- pressed are those who feel poor and oppressed. Hence progress lies not in changing conditions but in changing perceptions, and the door to perception is "imagination." Here it may be said that if Marx tended to translate philosophical questions into economic explanations, Thoreau offered aesthetic solutions to so- cial problems. The poet's imaginative description of Adam "con- templating his own virtue" is a literary metaphor without ethical significance. The description of an inner state of being inspires in us a vision by which life may be contemplated, but not a moral guide by which life may be lived. It is the pride of the poet that visions of the true and the beautiful will guide us to the good; it is the saving skepticism of the social scientist which warns us that human imagination and feeling may not be inherently benef- icent and that aesthetic awareness does not necessarily lead to moral conduct. The romantic argument for organic relationship between aesthetics and ethics remains as dubious as the rationalist argument for the relationship of virtue to reason. Thoreau's entire ethical system rests on a questionable analogy between art and life.45 Still further reservations arise when we turn to Thoreau's meta- physics of nature. Previously I have suggested that Marx tends to commit a "naturalistic fallacy" in assuming that human values have no other source than the mediation of man and nature through the agency of labor. In synthesizing man and nature through the precepts of mind, Thoreau also succumbs to the equally disturbing "pathetic fallacy." Thoreau could assume that man is able to draw values from nature because he interpreted 45 On this analogy, see Joseph Wood Krutch, The Modern Temper (New York, Harvest Book edn., 1956), pp. 98-125.</page><page sequence="27">THOREAU, MARX AND ALIENATION 597 the natural world with such imaginative passion that nature is made to sympathize with his own feelings. "The universe con- stantly and obediently answers to our questions." Accordingly, he imputed to the "indescribable innocence and beneficence of Nature" such anthropomorphic qualities as "savage," "beautiful," and "wild." Nature was "Matter, vast, terrific," the omnipotent realm "of Necessity and Fate." Not only did he attribute non- natural qualities to the world of matter, he believed that as a "poet" he could "be something more than natural - even super- natural," since "Nature will not speak through but along with him. His voice will not proceed from her midst, but, breathing on her, will make her the expression of his thought. He then poetizes when he takes a fact out of nature into spirit." 46 By spiritualizing nature, by drawing moral truth from concrete fact, Thoreau thus breaks down the Kantian dualism between the actual world and the ideal world, between what "is" and what "ought" to be. Here the significance of Thoreau's romantic naturalism begins to resemble the Hegelian implications in Marx's historicism. In assuming a correspondence between human emotions and natural fact, Thoreau allowed nature (the "is") to fulfill the essential function of spirit (the "ought") in much the same way that Marx, in synthesizing history and philosophy, allowed the "inner neces- sity" of the dialectic to explain the meaning and direction of the material universe. Thoreau read meaning into nature just as Marx read purpose into history. For those who do not feel alien- ated from the cold indifference of the natural world or by the irrationalities of human experience; for those, in short, who find in the "rhythms" of nature or in the "logic" of history all the answers to the human condition, the "riddle" of alienation is solved. We thus come to the supreme paradox: only those who are not alienated can overcome alienation.47 4« Waiden, pp. 177, 207; Thoreau's statements on the "poet" are quoted in Perry Miller, "Thoreau in the Context of European Romanticism," New England Quarterly, XXXIV (June, 1961), pp. 147-159. 47 Most twentieth century intellectuals are alienated precisely because they cannot find meaning and value in nature or history. On the contemporary philosophical</page><page sequence="28">598 SOCIAL RESEARCH What all this suggests is that any comparison between Marx and Thoreau is fraught with irony. Marx, a fervently moral man who burned with a passion for justice, saw little historical signifi- cance in ethical action; Thoreau, a part-time recluse who yearned only to "wash" his hands of society, regarded moral regeneration as the absolute prerequisite to social reform. Marx, a theorist of Promethean powers, attributed very little to the power of ideas; Thoreau, a primitivist with an "aboriginal vigor*' (Emerson's description) for the natural world, perceived nature only as a symbol or metaphor revealing higher precepts of mind. Marx, a scholar who spent much of his life indoors researching and writ- ing, looked upon work and the working class as the instruments of historical salvation; Thoreau, a worker-intellectual who labored outdoors with his hands and conversed with a fraternity of toilers, looked upon work as a delusion and a diversion. Marx, a human- ist who glorified the transforming powers of productive man, asked very little of man himself; Thoreau, a naturalist who glori- fied the harmonious powers of the inanimate world, asked perhaps too much of man. And ultimately these ironic perspectives lead to an escape from metaphysics and politics: Marx saw no need to come to grips with moral problems, Thoreau saw no need to become involved with social problems. To overcome alienation Marx offered us a philosophy of action, Thoreau a philosophy of contemplation. It would be facile to say that a choice between the two is a choice between justice and wisdom. The real choice is between a knowledge without truth and a truth without power.
