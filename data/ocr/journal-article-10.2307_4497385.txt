Innumerable articles have debated the beginnings of coinage, and a spate of recent books have studied its effects on epinician poetry (L. Kurke, The Traffic in Praise [Ithaca, 1991]), interpersonal relationships (S. von Reden, Exchange in Ancient Greece [London, 1995]), class ideology (D.W. Tandy, Warriors into Traders [Berkeley, 1997]; L. Kurke, Coins, Bodies, Games, and Gold [Princeton, 1999]), management of the Persian empire (G. Le Rider, La Naissance de la monnaie [Paris, 2001]), and politics and the economy (D.M. Schaps, The Invention of Coinage and the Monetization of Ancient Greece [Ann Arbor, 2004]). What interests Richard Seaford is how people think, and early Greek thought for him is intimately bound up with money. He is speaking not about the obvious candidates like Theognis or Thucydides but about the Presocratic philosophers, claiming not merely that they think money is important, but that their basic concepts are conditioned by the development of money. The book has two parts, the first describing the social and intellectual background to the introduction of coinage and the second the intellectual developments that followed from it. Part I ('The genesis of coined money') covers, with significant differences of detail, much the same ground as the first half of my book (mentioned above; we worked independently) and comes to similar conclusions: the innovation of coinage was not so much technological as conceptual, affected by the more developed, silver-based economy of the Near East but determined by cultural, social and economic factors peculiar to Greece. For S., two major factors made coinage appropriate to the Greeks: a crisis in the reciprocity that had defined each person's proper place, and a sacrificial system based on community and equality. Now identical tokens that passed freely from hand to hand integrated a society for which Homeric reciprocity was inadequate and Mesopotamian centralised redistribution inappropriate. At the end of Part I S. enumerates the essential features of money: it is homogeneous, unlike the individu- alised Homeric gifts; it is impersonal, losing connection with its owner when spent; it is a universal aim, whose pursuit unites all people; it is a universal means, without</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 11 which nothing happens, not even ritual; it is unlimited; it unites opposites, making the good bad and the bad good; it is both concrete (a metal disk) and abstract (a unit of value). All these characteristics make money distinct from anything else. In Part II ('The making of metaphysics') S. surveys, from the surviving scraps, a number of the earliest Greek thinkers, finding in their world-view these very features. For Anaximander, all things come from and return to to apeiron, 'the unlimited', just as all things are 'converted from and converted into' (i.e. bought and sold for) money. Xenophanes' non-anthropomorphic god has, to some extent, a personality: although he does not move, he thinks, sees and hears. He is like the tyrant, whom, as S. has argued elsewhere ('Tragic Money' in JHS 118 [1998], 119-39), money isolates from society. Heraclitus' universe of endless movement and transformation mirrors the monetary universe of endless transactions. Parmenides' One, self-sufficient, isolated, and yet limited, is like the abstract value of money, which is all these things. The importance of number to the Pythagoreans reflects the countable value of coinage, and harmonia produces the physical world as money combines opposites and makes commensurate the incommensurable. For Protagoras 'of all things the measure is humankind' because the abstract world of value is created by man-made conventions. For each seemingly facile parallel S. argues in detail that the philosophers' unseen 'real' world behind the false world of appearances parallels the new economics in which money, abstract yet concrete, unchanging yet in constant motion, pervasive yet unseen, controls human beings without their awareness. The parallels are carefully elaborated: S. offers no fewer than ten parallels between money and Anaximander's apeiron (pp. 205-7). If I have reservations - and no thinking person could read so elaborate a hypothesis without reservations - it is not because I think S.'s parallels are superficial, but because I find them suspiciously precise. I do not doubt that when confronted with problems beyond our daily experience we approach them by metaphor, where the egg-laying bee is a queen and market equilibrium an invisible hand. I presume, therefore, that the citizens of a newly monetised society think about questions in new terms, and I was favourably predisposed to S.'s claim 'that the universal power bestowed by this communal confidence on the abstract substance of money was ... a precondition for the genesis and subsequent form of presocratic metaphysics, in which universal power belongs to an abstract substance which is, like money, transformed into and from everything else' (p. 11). But in the end I got more than I asked for: not merely a new metaphor that opened up new ways of thought, but an elaborate set of parallels whereby almost the entire metaphysics of the Presocratics is an allegory for money. Metaphor uses one thing to suggest ways of looking at another; allegory uses one set of terms to speak about another phenomenon entirely. When S. writes that for Xenophanes 'the personal is embodied no longer in the relation of reciprocity but in one controlling individual. It is as if the power of money (in the hands of the individual) is now complete, with the personal relationship of autonomous reciprocity marginalised' (p. 213), his Xenophanes seems to be speaking about money and not about god. It appears that S. himself has his hesitations: whereas in his introduction money was 'a precondition' for Presocratic metaphysics, he later claims only that 'one factor in the genesis ... of philosophical cosmology in general, was money' (p. 208). We mostly see correspondences between S.'s analysis of money and the Presocratics' opinions; but since S. knows the Presocratics, we cannot be certain which way the influence has gone. Since S.'s money is paradoxical, almost anything can be a parallel. Anaximander's apeiron is unlimited, like money; Parmenides' One is limited, also like money.</page><page sequence="3">12 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Heraclitus' world is in constant transformation, like money; Parmenides' is unchanging, also like money. Anaximander's apeiron is impersonal, like money; Xenophanes' god is personal, like a wealthy tyrant. Much of Presocratic philosophy is not allegory or metaphor, but an attempt at rational analysis of matters that were beyond the understanding of the early Greeks, as they are beyond our own. But S.'s basic insight - that the Presocratics' idea of the structure and origin of the universe closely paralleled the money-based structure of their own social relationships - is a powerful one, and not to be discarded lightly; nor can S.'s elaborate parallels be dismissed with a wave of the hand. A good deal of work remains to determine exactly how the metaphor of money shaped the concepts of the Greeks; and no small part of that work must address the question of how concepts are derived from metaphor.
