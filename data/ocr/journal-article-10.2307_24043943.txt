In this reading the pasqueflower is at least doubly-suppressed As for Thel's Mole, it is nothing new to suggest that this blind as a referent. It represents not "itself' or its species, but a creature has an experiential "insight" that the Eagle as eagle serpent—which in turn represents in Blake's canon a whole can never access, for although the Eagle can "see" where the discursive repertoire of possible invested meanings.

More recent debate has concerned whether it toral economy which has heretofore comprised the ratio or is Thel or the creatures of Har who are responsible for the "round" of Thel's own particular mode of life. poem's seeming obsession with use-value. It is necessary to emphasize, then, that Thel, and not the creatures she en Thel's articulation of her rebellious desire repeatedly counters, originally introduces this theme into the poem, in terms of "gentleness" is telling in this regard: "Ah! gentle She introduces it on the second plate, where she character may I lay me down, and gende rest my head. / And gentle izes the Lilly in terms of the various functions it performs in a sleep the sleep of death and gentle hear the voice / Of him distinctly human-oriented pastoral economy.

Thel, the Lilly is praiseworthy because it nourishes the lamb Thel's insistent repetition of the word "gentle" suggests at and cleanses its mouth of "all contagious taints," "purif[ies] least an intuitive understanding that her life has involved a the golden honey," and "Revives the milked cow, &amp; tames the customary or habitual violence; and it implies, moreover, an fire-breathing steed" (2:5-10).

Perhaps her simultaneous desire for, and fear of, "fad[ing] away" is part of a larger, frightening According to Swedenborg's specific articulation of this desire to free herself from this economy of self-centredness doctrine, "Love and Wisdom are mere Nothings, and only by assuming a role as a strand in the cosmic web rather than ideal Entities, without Reality, until they are applied to Uses; as its focal point, for Love, Wisdom and Use, are three things which cannot be separated ... for Love is Nothing without Wisdom, but being In light of Thel's preoccupation with the notion of hi in Wisdom it is formed to a Something, which Something is erarchy, however, such a thought is perhaps whimsical.

The ecological pies, as the poem's human representative, a "pearly throne" applicability of such a doctrine depends, however, on how (2:12) near or at the pinnacle of a Great Chain of Being, broadly one defines "Use."

Despite Davies' seemingly in- culminates in Thel's declaration of her own uselessness, her elusive rhetoric, it is clear that in Swedenborg's doctrine of fear that she lives "only ... to be at death the food of worms" use the "whole of creation" is "on its way to [the human] (3:18-20, 23; my emphasis). Thel wishes, in short, to be of table." The Book of Thel gestures, however, toward a larger use to the fragrant flowers and the pleasantly "warbling applicability for the concept of use; its representation of the birds," but she is disgusted by the thought of serving lowly human body's usefulness as "the food of worms" (3:23-6) sug- worms.

Such dismantling is certainly evident in centred utility—she would begin to understand the holiness Blake's portrait of the Clod of Clay, who paints herself as "the of all life, the intrinsic value or "bless[edness]" of literally meanest thing" (4:11), but who is nonetheless convinced that "every thing that lives." The wisdom implicit in such an un- "he that loves the lowly" has given her "a crown that none can derstanding would dispel the particular utilitarian anxiety take away" (5:1, 4).

Hence, the "voice of sorrow [which] breathed from the The same can be said about the Eye's inability to "be hollow pit" (6:10; my emphasis) is a living, aspiring voice, closed" to the "poison of a smile."

This would not hand, the epistemological instability implied by such a lack of remove Thel from the anthropomorphic economy, for, as knowledge indicates a healthy openness to experience and 175</page><page sequence="11">novelty, an openness that Thel would do well to emulate. On the other hand, however, such openness can dangerously en gender (and I use the term deliberately) a passivity that leaves Thel open, like the Lilly and the Clay, to manipulative inscription by active forces such as patriarchal discourse, which would constitute her as a pathological, self-abnegating subject. These diametrically opposed possibilities exemplify Thel's thematic ambiguity (see Eaves et al. 74-81), supporting Gerda Norvig's argument that Blake "forged the trope of liminality at every threshold, every barrier of signification in the text" (264). Blake's overall discourse on nature is, I argue, precisely one of liminality. It involves both the highest praise—"Na ture is Imagination itself' (E702); "Truth is Nature" (E609); "every thing on earth is the word of God Sc in its essence is God" (E599)—and the deepest scorn—"Where man is not nature is barren" (E38); "Nature Teaches nothing of Spiri tual Life but only of Natural Life" (E634); "The Natural Body is an Obstruction to the Soul or Spiritual Body" (E664); and, purportedly, "Nature is the work of the Devil" (Bentley 318). Needless to say, these contrary sets of assertions are exceed ingly difficult to reconcile: one cannot side with either ver sion of Blakean Nature at the expense of the other without distorting Blake's thought. In other words, because Blake's "spectrum of nature . . . ranges from barrenness to truthful ness" (Lussier 399), it would be as misguided to say that Blake is a forthright champion of nature as it has always been to argue that Blake "despised" the material world (Ackroyd 257) and "rejected nature utterly" (Riede 7). Or perhaps not quite. For liminality is by its very nature unsetding, dis turbing. It resists the complacency and easy appropriative gestures that pétrifie doctrinal formulations of nature have tended to generate and cultivate. One hardly need point out that, as a concept, nature is dangerous. History testifies to the multitude of ways that this concept has enabled the naturali zation of orthodoxies based on patriarchy, racism, classism, and even, somewhat paradoxically, the related systems and technologies that devastate the planet's biosphere—often under the guise of respect and praise for the "natural." A liminalist view of nature is, perhaps, one that can successfully oppose such appropriations of nature and the "natural." From this perspective, the idealistic notion that the vegetative flourishes on the letters of the word "BOOK" on Thel's tide page suggest "a free interchange between word and world" (Eaves et al. 82) can be balanced by the more sober and un setding possibility that this iconography signifies the way that human language and the discursive systems that organize its usage inevitably penetrate and colonize organic nature. The former view enables a celebration of the human-nature rela tionship; the latter necessitates the active and critical caution of Mental Warfare. Both of these approaches to nature are integral ingredients of a truly emancipatory human ecologi cal politics. NOTE 'All references to Blake's writing are from David V.
