<plain_text><page sequence="1">CERNUDA AND DAIMONIC POWER C. CHRISTOPHER SOUFAS, JR. West Chester State College EMPLIED by the juxtaposition La reali- Lady el deseo, the title of Luis Cernuda's complete works in verse, is the existence of an alternative reality, a deliverance from the unfulfilling experiences of the present and thus a constant goal of personal de- sire. Indeed, in a letter of 1929 to Juan Guerrero, Cernuda proclaims that "Es cierto: hay una segunda realidad. iTanto como yo la he deseado! Mas ahora s61o tengo la forma. Si Ilego a poseerla alguin dia ... ."' Using a youth as his mask in the prose piece "La escuela de los adoles- centes" (1931), he characterizes his attrac- tion to the other reality in erotic terms, revealing that he is often seized by "el deseo de estrechar en mis brazos esa realidad mas noble, pura y espiritual que sospecho detras de la realidad visible," much as one would embrace a beloved.2 This idealism is tempered, however, by the painful realization that desiring alone will not assure the attainment of the superior reality: "el deseo es una pregunta / Cuya respuesta no existe, I Una hoja cuya rama no existe, I Un mundo cuyo cielo no exis- te."' Only with the intervention of a seem- ingly omnipotent force called daimonic power-both the guiding means to and a part of the nobler reality to which he aspires-is he able to overcome this frus- tration wrought by desire and to undertake to free himself from ordinary reality. Although Cernuda mentions the influ- ence of daimonic power in his life and poetry in three articles written between 1931 and 1935, most of his critics have chosen to ignore it.4 More than simply a convenient metaphor, however, the term daimonic power is used by Cernuda to describe the lived experience of an almost divine force that progressively assumes control of both his life and the process of poetic creation. The coincidence, in 1931, of his pronouncement on the erotic nature of his attraction to the unseen real- ity and the initial declaration of the exis- tence of daimonic power suggests a connec- tion between this force, part of this hidden reality, and the sudden emergence of ideal- istic erotic aspiration as a major theme in the poetry beginning with Los placeres prohibidos (1931). This interrelationship is explicitly formulated in "Carta abierta a Lafcadio Wluki" (also of 1931), an open letter to the protagonist of Gide's Les Caves du Vatican, in which Lafcadio is perceived as not only the perfect model upon which to base a search for a beloved but also a gift from daimonic power and thus at least a partial answer to the "pre- gunta / Cuya respuesta no existe": "en efecto, como respuesta de ese poder demo- niaco, que indefectiblemente siento como va rigiendo nuestras vidas, vino a mis manos dicho libro" (p. 1095).' In "La escuela de los adolescentes" Cernuda reit- erates daimonic power's ability to affect individual destiny, noting as well that it relentlessly guides all who become aware of it toward a goal compatible with personal aspiration: "Hay un poder demoniaco, no se si ajeno o no a nosotros mismos que actuia y dispone nuestro rumbo con arreglo a un secreto destino . . . este rumbo tiene siempre una sutil afinidad, mis o menos exacta, con nuestro espiritu" (p. 1236). This force, therefore, not only kindles erotic aspiration but also takes charge of the very process by which desire will be eventually fulfilled. "Palabras ante una lectura" (1935), the preface to the first edition of La realidad y el deseo, however, presents a substantially revised vision of daimonic power. Because of his sustained experience of this force in the four years that have passed, Cernuda has discovered an unforeseen destructive aspect. No longer a beneficent force that has an affinity with individual will, dai- monic power is now perceived as some- thing to be struggled against: No s6lo lucha el poeta con su ambiente social, sino que asiste a otra lucha igualmente dramitica, quiza mas dramrtica auin, pero las fuerzas con quienes en este caso lucha son invisibles ... La sociedad moderna ... ha decidido prescindir del elemento misterioso inseparable de la vida . . . Pero el poeta no puede proceder asi, y debe contar en la vida con esa zona de sombra y de niebla que flota en torno de los cuerpos humanos. Ella constituye el refugio de un poder indefinido y vasto que maneja nuestros destinos. Alguna vez he percibido en la vida la influencia de un poder demoniaco, o mejor dicho, 167</page><page sequence="2">168 C. Christopher Soufas, Jr. Hispania 66 (May 1983) daim6nico que actfia sobre los hombres.... A ese poder alude Goethe en sus conversaciones con Eckermann, y acaso sea el mismo que consumia la vida de HOlderlin; tal el fuego en la zarza ardiente que vio Mois6s. Confundido con el don lirico que habite en ciertos poetas, parece como si las fuerzas fisicas de estos no pudieran resistirle, vi6ndose arrastrados a la destrucci6n, para alcanzar al fin, tras la muerte, una enigmitica libertad. (pp. 874-76) As the example of Holderlin demonstrates, daimonic power can so captivate an indi- vidual that he eventually surrenders his will to it completely. This is precisely the expe- rience of Cernuda in the poetry, although, unlike HOlderlin, he is able to survive his ordeals with his sanity essentially intact. Before discussing the volumes which portray Cernuda's most intense experience with daimonic power-Los placeres prohi- bidos (1931), Donde habite el olvido (1932- 33), and Invocaciones (1934-35)-it will be useful to examine its specific characteris- tics in greater detail. In "Palabras ante una lectura" he mentions the influence of the Conversations with Eckermann in the formulation of his ideas about daimonic power. In this work Goethe emphasizes its irrationality and uncontrollability: The Daemonic is that which cannot be explained by Reason or Understanding; it lies not in my nature, but I am subject to it . . . It manifests itself in the most varied manner throughout nature-in the visible and the invisible ... The Daemonic manifests it- self in a thoroughly active power.6 Because of its ability to motivate men to act even in spite of themselves, he implies that, but for daimonic power, many under- takings might otherwise be left unfinished. Goethe's ideas derive largely from the ancient Greeks who believed in an om- nipotent, invisible, irrational daimonic force as well as in anthropomorphic dai- mons. Homer, for example, used the term 8at'4ov to signify the activity of a divinity, his power to effect change and movement, while Ooq was used to denote a divinity in the inactive state.' From earliest times, therefore, daimonic power was associated with the ability to facilitate action. It was also imagined by many to exist separately in an intermediate realm between heaven and earth. Here the daimons were believed to dwell, semi-divine creatures living in ecstacy, the connecting link to the gods who frequently visited mortals on behalf of the more aloof Olympians. Through contact with a daimon mortals could ex- perience, on occasion, an expansion of consciousness that granted them temporary superhuman powers.8 Since for the early Greeks the Christian concepts of a single all-knowing and ra- tional God and a sinister Devil or Evil One were lacking, daimonic power fulfilled both roles simultaneously. Thus contact with this force via the daimons did not automatically assure a satisfactory experi- ence for the affected mortal. Many times, in fact, the daimonic experience was nega- tive. For this reason the daimon was re- garded as a guardian angel figure and mis- chief-causing devil in one, a creature to whom the concepts of good and evil did not apply and against whom the rational human will could not prevail.' It is not difficult to imagine, therefore, how dai- monic power came to be associated with the idea of fate and the uncontrollable, irrational workings of the supernatural. Indeed, daimonic power is truest to its nature when it brings upon or is the cause of bringing upon an individual something contrary to his will.'0 By far the most important and powerful of the daimons identified by the Greeks is Eros. The most famous discussion of the daimonic nature of love is found in Plato's Symposium during Socrates' dialogue with Diotima: "What can Love be then?" I said. "A mortal?" "Far from it." "Well, what?" "As in my previous examples, he is half-way between mortal and im- mortal." "What sort of being is he then, Diotima?" "He is a great spirit [Sattov], Socrates; everything that is of the nature of a spirit is half-god and half man." "And what is the function of such a being?" "To interpret and convey messages to the gods from men and to men from the gods, prayers and sacri- fices from the one, and commands and rewards from the other . . . Spirits are many in number and of many kinds, and one of them is Love."" Acting in the capacity of an intermediary and not as a god in the Platonic system, Love thus facilitates access by mortals to a more intense, almost divine reality. Not just the ancients but a contemporary think- er, the psychologist Rollo May, has also associated eros and daimonic power, mak- ing them not only identical but also re- sponsible for facilitating the same type of intensified experience described in the Symposium: The daimonic is the elementary power by which one is saved from the horror of not being one's self</page><page sequence="3">Cernuda and Daimonic Power 169 on the one hand, and on the other hand, of feeling no connection and no vital drive toward the other person . . . "Eros is a daimon," we recall; eros has to do not simply with love . .. it has to do with an energizing, a shocking of our normal existence-it is a gadfly that keeps us forever awake ....1 , In Los placeres prohibidos Cernuda is also very much aware of the same daimonic gadfly compelling him to transcend the ordinary circumstances of his life by means of erotic aspiration. His ecstatic first en- counter with its liberating energy, however, inspires him to strive for more than simply the experience of love in another human body. His goal becomes a superhuman one -possession of the force responsible for his attraction to (and, by implication, the presence of) a beloved object. As he con- fesses in "El joven marino," he responds primarily to the daimonic agent effecting the changes in his life, Love himself, and not to the bodies which are but pale re- flections of his dazzling brilliance: Cambiantes sentimientos nos enlazan con este o aquel cuerpo, Y todos ellos no son sino sombras que velan La forma suprema del amor, que por si mismo late, Ciego ante las mudanzas de los cuerpos, Iluminado por el ardor de su propia llama invencible. (pp. 123-24) In short, in Los placeres prohibidos Cer- nuda falls in love with Love."' The fatalism almost inherent in any erot- ic ideal of this intensity is magnified further in Cernuda's case by the fact of his homosexuality.14 Since society restricts him from freely expressing his love, it is not surprising that he should seek an outlet that offers at least a possibility for fulfill- ment, however remote and however dan- gerous to achieve. As desire grows more intense yet at the same time more frustrated in the poems of Los placeres prohibidos, Cernuda begins to perceive that that outlet is daimonic power and gives himself to it with progressively greater abandon. In the process daimonic power evolves signifi- cantly to become not simply the means to intensified experience but the overriding goal of desire. The intensity of desire expressed in "Dire c6mo nacisteis" suggests that it cannot be satisfied by sexual or even spiritual union with a corporeal beloved. In fact, it is not a physical being which Cernuda addresses but the placeres prohibidos. Symbolizing all the mysteries and joys awaiting in the alternative reality, the placeres extend to him "en una mano el misterio" (p. 68, my italics) and thus resemble closely "el ele- mento misterioso inseparable de la vida," daimonic power. In allowing himself to be- come captivated by the inspirational dai- monic agent instead of a flesh-and-blood companion, however, he necessarily rele- gates the physical beloved to the status of a pretext. In "Los marineros son las alas de amor" this devaluation is effectively communi- cated by the marineros, symbols of Cer- nuda's erotic experiences during the search for the daimon. As Love's wings and mir- rors, the sailors are little more than con- duits for the blond light, Love's color, to which he is most attracted: Los marineros son las alas del amor, Son los espejos del amor, El mar les acompafia, Y sus ojos son rubios lo mismo que el amor Rubio es tambi6n, igual que son sus ojos. (pp. 74-75) Since he is but a reflection of the true ob- ject of desire, the physical beloved is val- ued, not as an end in himself, but as a means through which to experience the daimon. In the wishful aggrandizement of the corporeal pretext in the final strophe, Cernuda further suggests that these finite beloveds are inadequate even as means. A passion such as his requires a marinero as vast as the sea: Si un marinero es mar, Rubio mar amoroso cuya presencia es cntico, No quiero la ciudad hecha de sueflos grises; Quiero s61o ir al mar donde me anegue, Barca sin norte Cuerpo sin norte hundirme en su luz rubia. (p. 75) Ultimate satisfaction is to be found in but one source, the daimonic force symbolized in the luz rubia in which he seeks his defin- itive reflection. A variation of the same idea is pre- sented in "Te quiero," in which Cernuda addresses an imaginary beloved to recount the many ways he has expressed the words "I love you." In the final strophes, how- ever, he reveals again that desire extends beyond the beloved: Te lo he dicho con el miedo, Te lo he dicho con la alegria, Con el hastio, con las terribles palabras.</page><page sequence="4">170 C. Christopher Soufas, Jr. Hispania 66 (May 1983) Pero asi no me basta; Mas alla de la vida, Quiero decirtelo con la muerte, Mas alla del amor, Quiero decirtelo con el olvido. (p. 84) Desire reaches toward love's farthest limits -as he states at another point, "Hasta el fondo del mismo amor que ningiin hom- bre ha visto" (p. 92)-bordered on the one side by death and on the other by for- getfulness. By characterizing his aspiration in such absolute terms, Cernuda demon- strates that his goal is not simply the experience of this force that has communi- cated with him by means of beloved inter- mediaries but its almost divine power as well, likened to "el fuego en la zarza ardiente que vio Mois6s." "Qu6 mas da" presents a vision closely approximating that of the "zarza ardiente" in which Cernuda completely transcends the physical pretext to address directly the true object of desire: Que mas da el sol que se pone o el sol que se levanta, La luna que nace o la luna que muere. Mucho tiempo, toda mi vida, esper6 verte surgir entre las nieblas mon6tonas, Luz inextinguible, prodigio rubio como la llama; Ahora que te he visto sufro, porque igual que aqullos No has sido para mi menos brillante, Menos efimero menos inaccesible que el sol y la luna alternados. Mas yo se lo que digo si a ella te comparo, Porque aun siendo brillante, efimero, inac- cesible, Tu recuerdo, como el de ambos astros, Basta para iluminar, t(' ausente, toda esta niebla que me envuelve. (p. 80) Consciously imitating the conventions of the poetry of courtly love in his compar- ison of the object of his aspiration to both the sun and moon, Cernuda carries the troubadouresque tradition further still by completely disassociating his beloved from any hint of corporality. This ephemeral, inaccessible, and brilliant "luz inextin- guible, prodigio rubio como la llama" can be none other than Love in all his daimonic brilliance, for by now nothing less will suffice. In "Como leve sonido," however, he comes to realize that his desire has become so intense and so exclusively focused upon daimonic power that he has begun to lose control of his ability to function independ- ently of it. He senses that, like the physical beloved, his own existence is also merely a pretext for the expression of daimonic power. Addressing the guiding force ("Tu presencia") responsible for his passion, Cernuda compares himself and the beloved pretext to leaves, the visible evidence of the existence of the invisible agent which ani- mates them: Como todo aquello que de cerca o de lejos Me roza, me besa, me hiere, Tu presencia esti conmigo fuera y dentro, Es mi vida y no es mi vida, Asi como una hoja y otra hoja Son la apariencia del viento que las lleva. (p. 83) Thus the closer he approaches the direct experience of the alternative reality, the more he discovers that it is the will of the daimon and not his own which is determin- ing the course of events. Given the irrational nature of all dai- monic experiences, it comes as no surprise that Cernuda's subsequent direct encounter with the daimon in Donde habite el olvido (via a corporeal pretext) results in total disaster and in his failure to attain the power to free himself from ordinary real- ity. The initial poem leaves no doubt as to who is responsible for this catastrophe and the ensuing personal torment. Not the physical beloved, who is not even men- tioned, but the daimon Love turned tor- mentor provides the motivation for the new desire to evade the present in a realm of forgetfulness, . . . esa gran regi6n donde el amor, Angel terrible, No esconda como acero En mi pecho su ala, Sonriendo lleno de gracia aerea mientras crece el tormento. (p. 89) Exactly fulfilling the traditional daimonic role of both angel and devil in one ("Angel terrible"), Love makes life as unbearable now as it was ecstatic before, revealing a terrible fact that Cernuda, captivated by his initial attractiveness, had not foreseen. Poem III reveals, however, that a major factor in precipitating this crisis was pre- cisely the power-hungry attempt to capture not simply intimate knowledge of a beloved but the ultimate, Love himself: Esper6 un dios en mis dias Para crear mi vida a su imagen, Mas el amor, como un agua, Arrastra afanes al paso. (p. 90) Aspiring to a transformation of his very being, a godlike status that could only be</page><page sequence="5">Cernuda and Daimonic Power 171 facilitated by something equally godlike, his hopes were dashed when Love, like a tidal wave, flooded his consciousness. In a brief moment of initial ecstasy, the final remnants of individual will were con- sumed, thereby allowing the daimon to work his mischief: Me he olvidado a mi mismo en [las] ondas [del amor]; Vacio el cuerpo, doy contra las luces; Vivo y no vivo, muerto y no muerto Ni tierra ni cielo, ni cuerpo ni espiritu. (p. 90) Experiencing the psychic equivalent to his being consumed by "el fuego en la zarza ardiente"-in poem IV he compares him- self to a "columna ardiente"-Cernuda becomes totally alienated from himself and thus demonstrates, temporarily at least, traits of insanity shared by other victims of daimonic power, most notably HOlder- lin. Realizing that he has lost his chance to possess the power of the alternative realm yet unwilling to resign himself again to ordinary reality, his vision grows more desolate and bitter. The failure to attain the alternative reality is portrayed figuratively in various poems by the motif of a fall from a state of happiness and power, especially in poem X where Cernuda compares himself to a fallen angel whose attempt to usurp divine power precisely characterizes his relation- ship with Love: Bajo el anochecer inmenso, Bajo la lluvia desatada, iba Como un ingel que arrojan De aquel eden nativo. Absorto el cuerpo aun desnudo, Todo frio ante la brusca tristeza, Lo que en la luz fue impulso, las alas, Antes candor erguido, A la espalda pesaban sordamente. Se buscaba a si mismo, Pretendia olvidarse a si mismo; Niflo en brazos del aire, En lo mas poderoso descansando, Mano en mano, frente en la frente. (p. 95) The message of the third strophe is explicit. Cernuda sought a resting place in "lo mas poderoso" but was utterly defeated in the attempt when the daimon was confronted directly ("Mano en mano, frente en la frente"). As a result of his banishment from the daimonic paradise, life in the ordinary realm seems less than real: "S6lo vive quien besa / Aquel cuerpo de angel que el amor levantara" (p. 97). By virtue of this at least temporary resignation to failure, how- ever, Cernuda is afforded some retrospec- tive insights about the ordeal he has just endured. He now realizes that the physical beloved was Love's pretext (a being with a "cuerpo de angel que el amor levantara") and not his, as was suggested earlier. This idea is expanded in "Mi arcngel" in which Cernuda remembers the physical beloved as more daimonic in nature than human, an angel-devil figure (much like a Lucifer) whose "incesante filo contra el pecho" (p. 97) was simply too intense to endure because Love was in control all along. There is little consolation in this knowl- edge, however, since his defeat also makes him aware of both his vulnerability to dai- monic power and his own mortality: "No es el amor quien muere, / Somos nosotros mismos" (p. 96). Endowing the daimon with anthropo- morphic qualities here and in other poems in Donde habite el olvido suggests a de- valuation of his earlier status. Cernuda is now beginning to realize that his encoun- ter with Love was not a confrontation with the totality of daimonic power but rather with only part of a much more pervasive force that affects him in other areas as well. The succeeding volume Invocaciones thus continues to examine both the nature and scope of daimonic power as an active presence in his life even after the failure with Love. No longer working in harmony with his desire to gain possession of the alternative reality, daimonic power be- comes by 1935, the completion date of Invocaciones, "esa oscura fuerza daim6ni- ca que rige el mundo" (p. 875), an all- pervasive force against whose inscrutable will the poet must now struggle. In spite of its cruelties, however, Cer- nuda's attraction to daimonic power per- sists much as before. As demonstrated by "El viento de septiembre entre los chopos" the earlier desire to take power for him- self in the direct encounter with the daimon remains essentially intact. The only dif- ference is that the corporeal pretext is exchanged for one that more clearly ap- proximates his new intuition of daimonic power's actual scope, nature itself. Having realized in "Los fantasmas del deseo" that "El amor no tiene esta o aquella forma, I No puede detenerse en criatura alguna"</page><page sequence="6">172 C. Christopher Soufas, Jr. Hispania 66 (May 1983) (p. 102) but rather that the daimonic force exists throughout nature, Cernuda turns in the present poem to a grove of svelte, yel- low-leafed popular trees where he discovers "Un no s6 que, un sombra, / Cuerpo de mi deseo . . ." (p. 111). Incarnating the type of timeless and liberated existence that he sought in the previous encounter with Love, the trees inspire him to seek to fuse his ecstatic spirit with theirs and thereby to participate in the mysteries of the hidden reality presently denied him: "Vida, afdn, canto, os dejo. / Quiero anegar mi espiritu / Hecho gloria amarilla" (p. 112). The desire to become part of the "gloria ama- rilla" of this natural world is thus only a slight departure from the earlier desire to possess the "Luz inextinguible; prodigio rubio como la llama" of Love. Only the beloved pretext has changed. The hoped-for union with nature is not achieved, however, ushering in renewed feelings of desolation in the succeeding poem "No es nada, es un suspiro." Al- though his goal is to discover "de qu6 alta roca nace [el suspiro]" (p. 112)-i.e., the hidden cause of the present anguish result- ing from his inability to liberate himself from ordinary reality-he suggests in the third strophe that he already possesses an intuitive awareness that anguish shares a common source with the earlier experiences that gave him knowledge of ecstasy's point of origin, daimonic power. His grouping together of all his recent experiences-of love ("ese impulso"), of nature ("El viento entre los chopos"), and, in the present, of anguish ("suspiro")-not only underscores his awareness of the virtual omnipotence of daimonic power as a controlling force but also, by means of the extreme under- statement equating that force with nada, accentuates his own insignificance in com- parison: Un suspiro no es nada, Como tampoco es nada El viento entre los chopos, La bruma sobre el mar O ese impulso que guia Un cuerpo hacia otro cuerpo. (p. 112) The entreaty in the final strophe to the aloof and godlike sombra for knowledge and compassion thus becomes, in effect, an invocation of the daimonic force itself ("esa zona de sombra y niebla") to stand away from the darkness in which it is now surrounded and to reveal its benign face once again. Pleading for knowledge of the source of anguish, therefore, is but an al- ternate means, albeit a pathetic one, of attempting to establish direct contact with the force he knows also holds the promise of ecstasy: Sombra, si tii lo sabes dime; Deja el hondo fluir Libre sobre su margen invisible, Acuerdate del hombre que suspira Antes de que la luz vele su muerte, Vuelto el tambi6n latir de aire, Suspiro entre tus manos poderosas. (p. 113) As if responding to his plea in the follow- ing poem, the daimonic force demonstrates in "Por unos tulipanes amarillos" that it is not always uncommunicative and cruel. There is one consistent, if temporary, out- let available to Cernuda to use daimonic power for his own purpose, or at least mostly his own purposes, poetry. The pres- ent poem, in fact, describes the process of poetic creation as a positive encounter be- tween the poet and an external source of inspiration, daimonic power. Languishing in pereza and costumbre, Cernuda is inter- rupted by the "alegre mensaje de alguin dios," that is, a daimon who directs him to the tulips which become the subjects of his poem. The artistic product, however, comes into being only after the poet and the daimonic messenger seal the poetic pact in amorous embrace, thus paralleling precisely the earlier encounter with the daimon Love: No se advertia el eco de un remoto clima celeste En la figura del etereo visitante, Veiamos tan s6lo Una luz virgen, p6talo voluptuoso toda ella, Que ondulaba en sus manos bajo la sonrisa insegura, Como si temiera a la tierra. Con gesto enamorado Me adelant6 los tiernos fulgores vegetales, Sosteniendo su goteante claridad, Forma llena de seducci6n terrestre, En unos densos tulipanes amarillos Erguidos como dichas entre verdes espadas. Por un aletear de labio a labio Selle el pacto, unidos el cielo con la tierra, Y entonces la vida abri6 los ojos sin malicia, Con absorta delicadeza, como niio reciente. Tendido en la yacija del mortal mis sombrio Tuve tus alas, rubio mensajero, En transporte de ternura y rencor entremezclado; Y mordi duramente la verdad del amor, para que no pasara Y palpitara fija En la memoria de alguien, Amante, dios o la muerte en su dia. (pp. 113-14)</page><page sequence="7">Cernuda and Daimonic Power 173 During the creative process Cernuda ac- quires the same power as his daimonic counterpart ("Tuve tus alas, rubio mensa- jero"), in effect becoming greater than human for the timeless moment that he is in contact with the inspirational daimonic presence.'" Cernuda voices identical sentiments in his discourse on daimonic power in "Pala- bras ante una lectura": ... ese poder daim6nico a que aludo esti estrecha- mente unido a mis creencias po6ticas ... la poesia fija a la belleza efimera. Gracias a ella lo sobrenatural y lo humano se unen en bodas espirituales, engen- drando celestes criaturas, como en los mitos griegos del amor de un dios hacia un mortal nacieron seres semi-divinos ... En todo vibra un eco de la poesia, y ella no es sino expresi6n de esa oscura fuerza dai- m6nica que rige el mundo. (pp. 874-75) Analogous also to his earlier erotic aspira- tion is the belief that in poetic creation the "fuerza daim6nica" interacts intimately-- in a figurative sense sexually-with the human to produce semidivine offspring. Of a superior nature to the human being who helped to create it, however, the poem shares more in common with its daimonic parent since it exists in a timeless realm of art. The poet, on the other hand, experi- ences immortality or eternity only for as long as the poem is being created. At the end of the creative process he becomes part of ordinary reality again, which now seems even more desolate and uninviting than when he left it. Significantly, Cernuda includes the ex- perience of desolation as an integral part of the creativity cycle: Arrastrado en la rAfaga Al cobrar pie entre los mirtos misteriosos Que sustentan la tierra con su terco aliento de sombras, El claro visitante ya no estaba, S61o una ligera embriaguez por la casa vacia. Dura melancolia, No en vano has criado con venenosa leche, Siempre tu nuicleo seco Tropiezan nuestros dientes en la elAstica carne de la dicha, Como semilla en la pulpa coloreada de algu'n fruto, iD6nde ocultar mi vida como un remordimiento? Ti, Iluvia que entierras este dia primero de la ausencia, Como si nada ni nadie hubiera de amar mis, Dame tierra, una llama, que traguen puramente Esas flores borrosas, Y con ellas El peso de una dicha hurtada al rigido destino. (pp. 114-15) In spite of the fact that he has created an immortal work of art, Cernuda receives no lasting consolation since he now realizes that the creative power he possessed was ultimately a loan and that in its absence he can do nothing to prevent the ultimate de- struction of the tulips ("esas flores bo- rrosas"). Their mortality is a reminder that all the beautiful objects of this world are condemned by time to death and that the poet, in turn, is forced to witness that de- structive process and to lament it. Thus while poetry does afford him a temporary exercise of power, he must pay a price in desolation for his ecstatic moments and thus bear the "peso de una dicha hurtada al rigido destino." The definitive awareness of the tragic nature of his desire to possess this force in all its varied manifestations-as Love, as a force within nature, or as the inspira- tional factor essential for artistic creation -occurs in "El joven marino" which pre- sents the mythic account of his long rela- tionship with daimonic power. The young sailor who is the poem's protagonist, like Cernuda himself, is consumed by an insa- tiable desire. The sole object capable of responding adequately to it is the sea, a presence that most clearly reflects the boundless nature of his aspiration: Insaciable, insaciable. Con pie desnudo ibas sobre la olvidadiza arena, Dulcemente trastornado, como el hombre cuan- do un placer espera, Todo tfi vuelto apasionado albatros, A quien su trAgico desear brotaba en alas, Al Uinico maestro respondrias, El mar, 'inica criatura Que pudiera asumir tu vida poseyendote. (p. 121) Paralleling Cernuda's attempt to possess daimonic power by means of erotic expe- rience, the sailor shuns even the pretext of a corporeal beloved and looks to the sea to encounter the daimonic force beck- oning him to experience a more intense reality. The sea, in fact, is closely associ- ated with daimonic power. It is described at one point as "la gran criatura enigmati- ca, el mar inexpresable, / Sin deseo ni pena, igual a un dios ..." (p. 122); its creative power is also stressed: "Qui6n podria vivir en la tierra / Si no fuera por el mar" (p. 122). It is to this primal force symbolic of daimonic power to which the sailor gives himself. Attempting to idealize their union,</page><page sequence="8">174 C. Christopher Soufas, Jr. Hispania 66 (May 1983) Cernuda describes it in the following manner: Al amanecer es cuando debias ir hacia el mar, joven marino, Desnudo como una flor; Y entonces es cuando debias amarle, cuando el mar debia poseerte, Cuerpo a cuerpo, Hasta confundir su vida con la tuya Y despertar en ti su inmenso amor El breve espasmo de tu placer sometido, Desposados el uno con el otro, Vida con vida, muerte con muerte. (p. 125) The fulfillment of the sailor's tragic aspira- tion is possible only in his destruction, implying that the aspiration to possess the "inmenso amor" of daimonic power is, in the final analysis, a desire for death. Only in death can a desire of this nature find satisfaction and, as he states in "Pala- bras ante una lectura," "alcanzar al fin, tras la muerte, una enigmAtica libertad." For Cernuda, however, the sailor's death also symbolizes the defeat of his own ideals. His final words to him ("cuan dulce sera rodar, igual que tui, del otro lado, en el olvido. / Asi tu muerte despierta en mi el deseo de la muerte, / Como tu vida despertaba en mi el deseo de la vida") clearly reflect a new desire to abandon earlier aspirations now recognized as im- possible. The oblivion to which the sailor has been transported in death ("una enig- mitica libertad") is now preferable to the overpowering awareness of failure with which Cernuda must live. Daimonic power has thus evolved significantly to become not an instrument for self-transcendence but an oppressive reminder of his help- lessness and insignificance in the face of its supreme power. "El joven marino" is clearly the culmi- nating moment in Cernuda's relationship with daimonic power. With the outbreak of civil war in the following year and yet an- other personal crisis resulting from his exile from Spain, he begins to turn away from the pagan belief in a daimonic force, substituting instead the traditional Chris- tian deity as a source of consolation and stability. The transitional step to this new belief is witnessed in the elegy to Lorca, "A un poeta muerto," in Las nubes (1937- 40) where daimonic power is now portrayed as a sinister, freedom-denying force that subjects poets completely to its will ("Un viento demoniaco le impulse [al poeta] por la vida"-p. 37). The poem concludes, however, with a note of hope that the di- vine longing ("ansia divina") with which idealists like Lorca and Cernuda are tragi- cally smitten in life will be rewarded and consoled by "alguna mente creadora in- mensa" after death: . . . esta ansia divina, perdida aqui en la tierra, Tras de tanto dolor y dejamiento Con su propia grandeza nos advierte De alguna mente creadora inmensa, Que concibe al poeta cual lengua de su gloria Y luego le consuela a trav6s de la muerte. (p. 138) THE NEW HOPE in a rational deity, how- ever, is inspired as much by wishful thinking and a desire for order in his life as it is by a genuine adherence to the Chris- tian divinity. As the chaos in his life sub- sides, Cernuda slowly returns to his former pagan view of the world. In "La visita de Dios"-the title gives an indication of the brevity of his conversion-he admits that his belief in the Christian God is fostered out of the awareness of his own helpless- ness to shape the course of events. He ad- dresses God, in fact, as if He were but the personification of all his unrealized de- sires: "Mi sed eras tui, tui fuiste mi amor perdido, / Mi casa rota, mi vida trabajada, y la casa y la vida / De tantos hombres como yo a la deriva / En el naufragio de un pais" (p. 153). In "Las ruinas" of Como quien espera el alba (1941-44) he finally abandons the Christian deity altogether: ". .. ti no existes. Eres tan s61lo el nombre / Que da el hombre a su miedo y su impo- tencia" (p. 194). With the abandonment of the Christian divinity, Cernuda has re- turned to his starting point, unafraid yet still helpless. His experiences during these years, however, have also brought maturity and a new meditative spirit with which to examine and to question the assumptions of his youth. During that time his life was nothing more than a pretext for a goal impossible to achieve, condemning him in the aftermath to become like the noble pagan souls in Dante's limbo who must live without hope but in desire.

Harris, how- ever, confines himself largely to general statements and never develops a coherent thesis. 'Since it is a well-established fact that Cernuda was a homosexual, the physical beloveds to whom he refers are masculine. Also, Cernuda uses both demo- niaco and daim6nico to describe the same phenome- non. I have chosen the Greek form "daimonic" instead of the alternate spelling "daemonic" used by Harris since it corresponds to Cernuda's final ren- dering of the term in 1935. 6Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Conversations with Eckermann (New York: M.

'"In the classic study Love in the Western World (New York: Harper Colophon, 1974), Denis de Rougemont describes the love of love as a common aspect of the passion of all the great lovers in Western literature, most notably in the myth of Tristan and Iseult which he studies at length. Cernuda is original, however, in that he attempts to bring into visible focus for his audience the almost godlike force by which he is so captivated. De Rougemont labels this type of attraction a "frenzy or delirium which is neither conceived nor born in a man's soul except by the inspiration of heaven. It is alien to us, its spell is wrought from without; it is a transport, an infinite rapture away from reason and natural sense. It is therefore to be called enthusiasm, a word which actually means 'possessed by a god' . . ." (p. 61). For Cernuda, a slightly more precise char- acterization would be "possessed by a daimon." Los placeres prohibidos and the succeeding volume Donde habite el olvido recount the process of this daimonic possession. "Both Harris, Ch. II and V, and Philip Silver, "Et in Arcadia Ego": A Study of the Poetry of Luis Cernuda (London: Tamesis, 1965), Ch. III and IV, present views very similar to my own with regard to the destructive and doomed nature of the erotic ideal to which Cernuda is drawn. Although they do not specifically mention daimonic power in this context, they establish in significant detail that a fatalistic view of eros pervades the poetry of La realidad y el deseo. Harris' study is additionally useful, for it squarely confronts the issue of Cernuda's homosex- uality, thereby drawing deserved attention to what is clearly an important aspect of his work and an area all too often avoided by scholars. More recently Salvador Jimenez Fajardo, Luis Cernuda (Boston: Twayne, 1978), Ch. III, IV, and V, has made simi- lar observations on the amorous theme as well as on Cernuda's homosexuality. "Harold Bloom in The Anxiety of Influence (New York: Oxford University Press, 1973), pp. 99-111 includes "daimonization" in his theory of poetics and considers daimonic power a central factor in deter- mining poetic creativity: "The power that makes a man a poet is daemonic, because it is the power that distributes and divides. .... It distributes our fates, and divides our gifts, compensating whenever it takes from us."
