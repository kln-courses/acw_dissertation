<plain_text><page sequence="1">Imperialism and Environmentalism On the evening of December 10, 1992, the Northeast coast of the United States began to experience a violent winter storm, a Nor'easter, that was described by many officials and long-time residents as the worst storm in forty years, perhaps the worst in a century. The storm had already dumped up to five feet of snow across the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland, and it hit the New York metropolitan area with driving rain and wind gusts up to ninety miles an hour. This storm was not a hurricane, for it did not originate in the tropics, but its effects were much more acute than the most vicious hurricanes of this century. One reason for the severity of the effects of the storm was that it lasted for four days, through eight high tide cycles. The shoreline communities of New Jersey, New York, Long Island, and Connecticut were devastated: seawalls collapsed, streets were flooded, bridges, tunnels, and railroads were closed, and beaches and dunes were washed out to sea. Within a mile of my summer home on Fire Island, over twenty houses were destroyed by the ocean tidal surges. In the twenty-five years that I had visited or lived on that barrier beach, I had never seen one house wash away. I begin with this description of the so-called "storm of December 1992" because it is, for me personally, the most direct representation of the power of the natural world. Whatever else nature may be, it is a complex combination of forces that exerts its various powers throughout the entire physical world. In this essay I explore an idea—imperialism—as a way for understanding the relationship of power between nature and humanity. My working assumption is that the expressions, metaphors, and representations of the power of nature that we choose determine our normative stance to the natural world. When we adopt an antagonistic attitude, as I believe we do, we interpret the natural Copyright 1995 by Social Theory and Practice, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Summer 1995) 271</page><page sequence="2">272 Eric Katz world as an evil force that must be conquered. We view nature in terms of force and domination, as an objectified "other" that must be controlled. The use of the concept of imperialism in conjunction with both the policy of environmental ism and the forces of nature requires an explanation. In brief, I am consciously trying to expand the normal use of the concept of imperialism—indeed, one might say, to use an appropriately violent turn of phrase, that I am attempting to explode our normal concepts, especially those concerning the relationship between humanity and the natural environment. In this essay, I consider the idea of imperialism—and all that it represents concerning power, force, and domination—as a model or metaphor for understanding the human relationship with nature. Now a metaphor of imperialism and power is rather different from the benign and optimistic metaphor of "the balance of nature" so often used by environmental philosophers, scientists, activists, and policy makers. So one purpose of this philosophical examination into the power of nature is to open a dialogue about the forms of rhetoric that help to determine environmental policy. Which metaphors or models of the human/nature relationship are more appropriate? Should we view nature as a complex of aggressive forces, or as a balanced system of cooperation and harmony? Why should we choose one metaphor over another? Should we even make one exclusive choice? Why not use both metaphors—the benign and the violent—or others that may cross our minds? The metaphor we choose in a particular situation will have a fundamental impact on our ideas concerning the appropriate role of human action in the natural world. In this essay, theterms "nature," the "natural world," the "natural environment," and "natural processes" are used as roughly equivalent to that part of the world that lies outside human activity or human culture. Although "nature" can be used in a very broad sense to mean the natural or physical laws of the universe, I am not using that definition in this argument. The broad definition of nature as physical law does not exclude any physical phenomenon from being labeled as natural—such a characterization is virtually useless in moral philosophy or political theory, where distinctions must be made between various kinds of human and natural activity.</page><page sequence="3">Imperialism and Environmentalism 273 My meaning of "nature" is more restrictive, for it only concerns the ecosystems, bioregions, and undeveloped habitats of the Earth—and the entities and processes that constitute these physical spaces and systems. In brief, I use the term "nature" to mean the ecosystemic processes of the Earth. It is essential for my argument that imperialism represent more than the traditional idea of national and cultural conquest. It is more than one nation or community expanding its influence onto a less dominant nation-state, culture, or community. Imperialism is a form of domination—almost any instance of domination—in which one entity uses or takes advantage of another entity for its self-aggrandizement, to increase its power, its life, its comfort. Imperialism is thus an exercise of power. An entity uses its power to alter the world, to influence other entities, so that its own interests may be satisfied. Imperialism is, as it were, the policy that seeks to satisfy interests. It is in this sense that Bertrand Russell said that all living beings are imperialists;1 similarly, William Leiss speaks of the "imperialism of human needs."2 In philosophical terminology, imperialism results from any successful attempt to exert power over the "other." This sense of imperialism is connected to environmental policies because the relationship of power need not be located in the exclusive domain of human beings, human institutions, human nation-states. Imperialism expresses a relationship of power and domination, but the entities on either end of the power relationship can be either human or non-human. Nature—natural entities and systems—can be the "other" that is dominated by humanity, or it can be the dominating and imperialistic force that subdues some aspect of humanity. Logically, there are four basic possibilities: (1) Imperialistic humans exercise power over other humans; for example, the colonization of the Americas. (2) Imperialistic humans exercise power over nature; for example, the practice of agriculture. (3) Imperialistic nature exercises power over humans; for example, the destruction of beach houses in the December 1992 storm.</page><page sequence="4">274 Eric Katz (4) Imperialistic nature exercises power over other nature; for example, the process of forest succession. One immediate objection to this logical categorization is that it is based on an abnormal use of the idea of nature. Nature may be the "object" of a power-relation, in which case humans are the imperialists dominating a non-human "other," but nature cannot be the subject of an imperialistic power-relation. To regard nature as the subject exercising power, as in the third and fourth categories, is the error of anthropomorphism, seeing nature as a being with human qualities. Although there is some truth to this objection, it is not fatal to my overall project or argument in this essay. As I noted above, I am attempting to revise the traditional ways in which we think about nature. I want to consider nature as the subj ect of an ongoing history, a subject that acts and develops in ways that are comparable—in some moral or axiological sense—to human action. As Colin Duncan has claimed, "While Nature is certainly not a person ... it does have some of the attributes of a Hegelian subject. It can be both victim-like and agent-like."3 This metaphor may be a form of anthropomorphism, but it is different from the fully developed anthropomorphizing of nature found, for example, in Greek mythology. I am not attributing to nature the emotions, intentions, and reasoning powers of human subjects; I am only suggesting that it is incorrect to think of nature as a mere object, a passive recipient of human activity. Here we can also see how important it is to use the restricted meaning of nature introduced above—nature as the ecosystemic processes of the biological world. If we are to have a sense of nature as a subject or agent, acting upon humanity and human institutions, then it is imperative that we not view nature as simply the totality of physical laws of the universe. The laws of the universe do not act on anything—they are merely the descriptions of the ways in which the entities and systems of the universe operate. The idea that natural systems—or some parts of the natural world—act like imperialists, dominating other entities or systems, requires a sense of nature as a distinct system, able to stand in a relation with an "other." It is thus useful to use the</page><page sequence="5">Imperialism and Environmentalism 275 terminology of Lynton Keith Caldwell, who distinguishes the "Earth of nature" from the "world of man." The difference, he claims, is obvious: "the Earth is a creation of the cosmos and is independent of man. The world is a human artifact; it is a conceptual creation of human experience and information." It so happens that in the present epoch, the human world is "geographically congruent" with the Earth of nature,4 but this does not diminish their ontological distinctiveness. Nature is the sum total of non-human, biological, and evolutionary ecosystemic processes of the Earth's physical system. But this raises a second objection: the idea that "nature" and "humanity" are opposite points in a power relationship tends to reinforce the very separation of humanity and nature that an enlightened environmental policy seeks to overcome. It is surely one goal of the environmental movement to end the common belief that humans are separate from natural processes—to instill the ecological idea that humans are an interdependent part of the natural system, requiring a well-functioning natural environment to survive. But the notion of interdependence itself requires, at least conceptually, the idea that there are separate entities that are, in fact, interrelated. To say that humans are connected to natural processes requires an idea of a distinct human presence, a distinct human ontology, that is, nevertheless, dependent on the "otherness" of the non-human natural world. It is not a mistake to claim that humans can dominate nature, or that nature can dominate humanity, even though they are inseparably related. As Don E. Marietta, Jr., once stated to me in conversation, the "sugar can dominate the pudding"—even in the case where the blending of distinct elements forms a harmonious unity, one element can dominate the whole. This essay will not examine all four categories of imperialism, because they are not all of equal interest. The fourth type, nature's domination of nature, simply does not concern us, since we humans are not parties to the dispute, except indirectly. But what is intriguing about this schema is that almost all discussions of imperialism, even discussions of environmental imperialism, involve the first type, the domination of one human group by another. Environmental imperialism is generally seen as the</page><page sequence="6">276 Eric Katz alteration of natural systems by one human group as it colonizes and subsequently dominates or subdues another human group. Thus the European colonizers of the Americas used agriculture and a new conception of private property to modify the ecology and environmental context of the indigenous American peoples. In this first type of environmental imperialism, the effects of human activity on the natural world, although important, are indirect, secondary, or derivative. The basic form of imperialism is understood to be an expression of power between two human societies. Although an analysis and understanding of this type of imperialism is clearly important—as the work of Cronon, Crosby, and Merchant demonstrates5—I believe that we should also consider the second and third types of imperialism, the direct relationship of power between humans and nature. At the end of this essay I will comment briefly on the third form of imperialism, nature's power over human civilization, but I want to consider primarily the second form of imperialism, the human domination of nature, because this is the form over which we have some control, and hence, for which we have some responsibility. The human domination of nature is, of course, an old topic, even within the field of environmental philosophy: twenty-five years ago William Leiss's analysis of the influence of Francis Bacon was entitled The Domination of Nature. Clearly, the idea that humanity has exerted a fundamental influence on natural processes has become a standard and non-controversial datum of the environmentalist world-view. One need only read the introductory chapters of Al Gore's Earth in the Balance to see how the idea of human domination has permeated the mainstream consciousness of the environmental movement.7 But to what extent is this domination a form of imperialism? What is the relationship of power between humanity and nature? What is the philosophical meaning—ontological and axiological—of this relationship? Humanity has done more than influence natural processes. It has done more than "tame" wild nature for the increased comfort, wealth, and power of human beings. My central thesis is that humanity has attempted to modify and to mold natural processes</page><page sequence="7">Imperialism and Environmentalism 277 for the satisfaction of human interests, to create an artificial or artifactual world that produces the most benefit for human beings. This artificial world at best resembles nature, where it is convenient. It is the basic policy of human civilization—even where that policy is unarticulated—to modify or to conquer the natural world, to subdue Nature for the furtherance of human good. This policy has been the central project of Western civilization since the Enlightenment, and although it has proven in many respects to be a failure, its fundamental meaning and motivation is clear: the primary goal of Western civilization, especially Western science and technology, has been the control and domination of nature for the promotion of human benefit—the human imperialism over nature. The central meaning of Western civilization regarding human activity in the natural world is that human interests, the maintenance and improvement of human life, lie at the center of all value determinations. Human progress is the purpose of all human activity. Nature and natural resources are worthless, mere objects for exploitation by the dominant human species, until they are transformed, through human labor, into cultural instruments for human betterment. The analogy with traditional notions of imperialism is obvious. Humanity conquers and colonizes the natural world, with the moral justification that human good is the only determination of value, just as one nation-state might conquer another, judging its own interests to be supreme. One chilling example of the goal of the human imperialistic domination of nature can be found in a classic essay in the field of environmental ethics, Martin Krieger's "What's Wrong with Plastic Trees?"8 Krieger argues that if the goal of social policy is the maximization of human satisfaction and the promotion of social justice, then there is no overriding reason to preserve nature. An adequate technology, combined with a proper education through mass culture, could create an artificial plasticized world that would produce more happiness for the human population, at a lower cost, than the preservation of the natural world. Krieger writes: "There is no lack of merit in natural environments, but this merit is not canonical,"9 and he concludes that "Artificial prairies and wildernesses have been created, and there is no reason to</page><page sequence="8">278 Eric Katz believe that these artificial environments need be unsatisfactory for those who experience them."10 Thus he proposes an environmental policy of "responsible interventions" to mold both natural processes and the popular human responses to them. The goal of this new interventionist environmental policy should be the maximization of human satisfaction and social justice. Krieger's vision of a plastic artificial world designed for the maximization of human happiness is perhaps the most extreme case of human imperialism over the natural world. The terminology of "responsible interventions" even echoes the justification for the use of military force in U. S. foreign policy. Under Krieger's model, the natural world is not only subjugated to meet the demands of the dominating force (that is, humanity), it is virtually destroyed, replaced by a more docile, cooperative system of entities. The natural world becomes a mere pacified colony of the invading forces of humanity; aspects of the natural world that further human interests are preserved, or even augmented, while the aspects that interfere with human interests are destroyed, replaced, or exiled. Is Krieger's theory of environmental policy merely an extreme case? If it were, then we could probably ignore it, for as an extreme it would not have much influence on mainstream environmental policy or philosophy. But Krieger's imperialistic vision has surprisingly strong echoes in other theorists of environmental policy. Chris Maser, for example, is a former research scientist for the U. S. Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management, who argues in favor of a policy of "sustainable forestry" in The Redesigned Forest,n Maser is a critic of the short-term expediency of present-day forestry practices. He attacks the plantation mentality of forest management, and argues for a forestry policy that "restores" the forest as it is harvested. I have analyzed and criticized Maser's arguments for restoration elsewhere and will not repeat the full discussion here.12 In brief, Maser's model of the relationship between humanity and the natural world reinforces a notion of human imperialism over nature. Maser sees the natural world as a mechanism with a design that can be discovered and manipulated by human science and technology. At one point, he compares the mechanism of a forest</page><page sequence="9">Imperialism and Environmentalism 279 with an automobile as he argues empirically against the substitution of an artificial forest for a natural one: "A forest cannot be 'rebuilt' and remain the same forest, but we could probably rebuild a forest similar to the original if we knew how. No one has ever done it.. .^^Wje do not have a parts catalog, or a maintenance manual . 1 The implication is that if we did have a catalog and manual, then the restoration and redesign of forests would be practically and morally acceptable. For Maser, the ultimate motivation for forest redesign is the furtherance of long-term human interests. Maser argues that the central problem with current practices is that they are "exclusive of all other values except the production of fast-grown woodfiber."14 What concerns Maser is the elimination of other human values and interests. "We need to learn to see the forest as the factory that produces raw materials ..." to meet our "common goal[:] ... a sustainable forest for a sustainable industry for a sustainable environment for a sustainable human population."15 By using the complex knowledge of forest ecology, restorationist foresters will redesign forests to better achieve human purposes. Maser is an interesting case because, unlike Krieger, he is a committed environmentalist, indeed a hero to enlightened foresters and government officials dealing with practical environmental policy. But a philosophical analysis of his views clearly reveals the perspective of the human imperialism over nature. The fundamental goal for Maser is the proper use of the natural world to meet human needs—this is the basic motivation for any imperialism. His only quarrel with current forestry practices is in the methodology or the style of the domination. What then is wrong with the human imperialism over nature? Is the consideration of this type of imperialism a normative issue? Is not the human domination of nature necessary for human survival and human progress? Or is this imperialism a kind of moral evil, perhaps analogous to the human domination of other humans? Consider two problems or reasons why the human imperialism over nature is morally suspect. First, imperialism subverts or destroys the value of the subjugated entity. The value of the subjugated entity may be either good or bad relative to human</page><page sequence="10">280 Eric Katz interests—for example, a good rain forest or a bad disease organism. But regardless of whether the value is good or bad, the action of human imperialism or domination changes the pre-existing status. When we replace the natural world with an artificial human substitution, we also replace a particular complex of values. The act of replacement itself imparts a new reality and a new set of values. The new system may appear to be similar to the original natural system, but it will be, in actuality, a human artifact. It will be valuable, and indeed useful, for the human goods it furthers or promotes. If the new system were not at least thought to be valuable and useful for human interests then we would not bother to create it in the first place—one is not an imperialist over a worthless entity. But at the same time that we acquire the benefits of the new subjugated system or entity, we will lose access to the values of the original system or entity—we will lose the value of the undisturbed natural world. But is there an undisturbed natural world? Is there a nature that is independent of human power and human activity? The idea that human imperialism causes a loss to the value of the natural world raises important questions regarding the very meaning of nature itself. Thus, we can see that my original definition and discussion of the meaning of nature—as those ecosystemic processes independent from human culture and civilization—was clearly provisional; any detailed analysis of the meaning and value of human interaction with the natural world is forced to address the problem of the meaning of nature. One question results from the realization that the human impact on the natural world is so pervasive that nature as a separate system no longer exists. Is there a pure natural value that should be protected? A popular treatment of this theme can be found in Bill McKibben's The End of Nature, where McKibben focuses on the fact that humanity has changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere literally touches all of nature, once it has been changed, then the physical interactions that make up the natural system have also been changed. It can be argued, then, that no independent nature exists, and a concern for the value of a pristine, untouched nature is a product of a misplaced or overly sentimental nostalgia.</page><page sequence="11">Imperialism and Environmentalism 281 McKibben also suggests another question, when he writes: "When I say 'nature', I mean a certain set of human ideas about the world and our place in it."17 Nature is not only a system of physical entities that has been subjected to pervasive human influence, it is also a set of human ideas for describing and categorizing the world. Nature is a human idea. The models by which we describe the world of nature are human constructs; our theories of nature are themselves artifacts serving human ends. This, then, is another answer to the question of what nature is—it is a human construct. We human thinkers choose the model, metaphor, or idea of nature that will best serve our purpose—-just as I have chosen, in this essay, to view nature as the total set of ecosystemic processes. Thus nature is the victim of another form of human imperialism, what we can term an epistemological imperialism, for nature's very meaning is determined by human thought. The concept of nature, as well as its physical processes, is dominated by human thought and practice. An analysis of this domination is clearly a normative issue. The second normative problem with the human imperialism over nature concerns the third form of imperialism, the power that nature exerts over humanity. The plain fact is that humanity has not been entirely successful in exerting its influence over nature and natural systems for the furtherance of human good.This lack of success is apparent no matter which view of nature we take to be most relevant, for humanity has not succeeded in changing the physical laws of the universe, nor has it been successful in recreating functioning natural ecosystems. True, we have been quite effective in destroying natural systems, but our efforts at replacing them with useful human-friendly systems have been nearly catastrophic. One interpretation of the current environmental crisis is that it represents nature's backlash—its counter -insurgency—against the forces of human colonization. It is here that we recognize the awesome power of nature to reassert its independence from human attempts to control it. The ecosystemic processes that constitute nature react against human activity, in part by reducing our domain and dominion.18 The idea of nature's reaction, its counter-insurgency, gives a context and meaning to the fact of the beach houses being swept</page><page sequence="12">282 Eric Katz away by ocean tides and a hundred-year storm. Nature's power over humanity reveals the depth of the human arrogance that builds homes on sand. But the same point of view applies to our use of pesticides, fertilizers, nuclear energy—the list of nature's backlash is endless. So the second reason that the human imperialism over nature is a moral problem is that it cannot answer the response of nature's domination of humanity. Our attempts to dominate nature reveal a disturbing lack of prudence, to say the least. Despite our technology and science, nature is more powerful than human civilization. Several conceptual issues invite further discussion. First is the importance of intentionality in the analysis of domination. It appears that using the notion of imperialism to describe the acts of nature is problematic, whether these acts are directed towards humanity (the third type) or towards other natural entities (the fourth type). Nature's actions do not have intentionality. When the December storm washed away beach houses on the northeastern coast of the United States it was not the intention of nature to exert its power over humanity. So my notion of imperialism clearly broadens the traditional use of the concept, not only in the ideas of the proper subjects and objects of imperialism and domination, but in the basic structure of the imperialistic act. The moral analysis of domination may not require the existence of intention. It should be noted, however, that not all intra-human acts of domination require intentionality either. If racism and sexism are considered as forms of imperialistic domination (as I would so judge them), then there do exist instances of so-called "institutional" racism or sexism that are unconnected to specific or direct intentional actions. A person who is not a racist can act in a manner that promotes racism, for example, by following the procedures of an institution that unknowingly is structured to discriminate; thus some hiring and promotion requirements at a university may be racist (or sexist) in an institutional sense. The point is that domination can be unintentional. The focus on intentionality becomes relevant when we consider our moral evaluation of actions and their consequences. Since humans have, in general, control over the activities that they instigate in their interactions with the natural world, it is easy to</page><page sequence="13">Imperialism and Environmentalism 283 place blame or praise on the activities chosen. But it is senseless to blame nature for the destruction of beach houses or for a forest succession. Without the possibility of intention, the moral evaluation of the acting subject becomes impossible. A related issue would be the entire complex of problems involving the teleological structure of natural systems. Do natural entities and systems lack intentionality while at the same time displaying purposive activity? Can purpose exist without intentionality? Is purposive activity all that is necessary for the concepts of imperialism and domination? Unfortunately, I do not have answers to these questions, which involve fundamental issues in the philosophy of biology and perhaps in the foundations of metaphysics. I raise the issues here only because I want to demonstrate the significance of the discussion over imperialism and environmentalism; I seek to provoke a far-ranging debate. The final conceptual issue is, perhaps, the most important question raised by the preceding discussion. All four types of imperialism—but especially the second and third—reveal the necessity of the exercise of power over other entities. Humans must try to control some aspects of the natural world for their very survival; nature must respond as it asserts its independence from human design. The essential issue is then one of determining the proper scope of intervention and interaction. When are humans permitted to intervene in natural processes, and when should they refrain? When does an intervention become an attempt at domination? After all, humans must eat and grow food, must build houses, roads, cities, must cure disease. Are these all acts of imperialistic domination that are morally suspect? The answer to this problem lies in determining the proper metaphor, the appropriate rhetoric, for understanding the human relationship to nature. When one nation-state interacts with another nation-state in a spirit and a structure of mutual benefit and partnership, then it cannot be considered an act of imperialism or domination. Not all interactions are instances of unequal power relationships; to use a biological concept, some actions are symbioses. Thus, to understand whether or not a human intervention into natural processes constitutes an act of imperialism, we must consider the model or metaphor under which</page><page sequence="14">284 Eric Katz the act is structured. Do we humans seek a balance with nature, a type of partnership, or a power relationship of control and domination? Are our agricultural processes, for example, organic, working with natural processes, or are they highly technological, seeking control through artificial fertilizers and pesticides? To discover a criterion for the proper intervention in the natural world is the fundamental task in determining the real meaning of environmental policy. Only with a morally justifiable criterion will human activity within nature—whether this be political action, government environmental policy, resource management, ecological restoration, or wilderness and habitat preservation— avoid the stigma of domination. By placing this problem in the framework of imperialism and domination, I am suggesting that it is the broadest possible issue regarding human action. To be morally justified, all human activity, even that between humans, requires a standard of appropriate intervention. The determination of that standard is the central question of moral philosophy.19 Notes 1. Bertrand Russell, An Outline of Philosophy (New York: New American Libraiy, 1974), p. 30.
