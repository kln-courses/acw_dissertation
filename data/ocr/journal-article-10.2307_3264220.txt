<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Supplements to Vetus Testamentum, Vol. VII. (Congress Volume, Oxford, 1959.) Leiden: Brill, 1960. Pp. 359. Gld. 46. This excellent volume continues the high quality of the previous volumes. It is considerably larger than the earlier ones and contains twenty-two articles. The wide range of subjects provides such a wealth of material as to make a satisfactory review impossible. There are two stimulating articles on proper OT methodology. I. Engnell defends the traditio-historical approach in the light of recent criticism. M. Noth discusses the r61e of archeology in reconstructing the history of Israel and offers a vigorous rebuttal to the recent attacks of J. Bright. Several contributions can be grouped together in the area of text criticism, style, and translation. H. Orlinsky suggests that the kethib represented a majority reading, the qere the minority, whenever a variant occurred within the three best manuscripts selected. M. Burrows discusses problems involved in the RSV translation. Diez Macho attempts to date a recently discovered Palestinian targum. S. Segert summarizes his previous work on Hebrew prosody in which he disagrees with the approach of Sievers. A good bibliography on recent articles is included. Alonso-Sch6kel studies some of the chief stylistic features of the prophets. Finally, Perez Castro deals with a cryptogram in a medieval Samaritan scroll. R. Meyer's brief article gives a helpful summary of the present theories regarding the Hebrew verbal system. He continues to hold as probable an old West Semitic present-future form, yaqattal. J. J. Stamm offers an exhaustive study of the name David in which he makes reference particularly to the evidence from Mari. He is inclined to accept the meaning of "Vatersbruder." In the field of archeology and history J. B. Pritchard sketches the history of Gibeon in the light of his recent excavation. B. Mazar turns to the well-known problem of the Levitical cities and agrees with Albright in assigning the list to the Solomonic period. There are also articles on Qumran from Bardtke, Dupont-Sommer, and Strugnell. Finally, in the field of comparative religion and theology there is rich fare. J. Barr attempts to recover the theological significance of theophany and to determine its relationship to anthropomorphism. E. Jacob and E. Hammershaimb deal with problems of understanding the ethics of the OT. Of interest is Hammershaimb's thesis that the Hebrew prophets were dependent on the ethics of the Canaanites when they stressed the care of the fatherless and the widow. B. Gemser discusses biblical wisdom literature in the light of recently published Egyptian material. V. Maag deals with the concept of Yahweh's kingship as a problem of comparative religion. E. Nielsen studies the history of the ark. The book closes with an article of L. Rost in which he traces the worship of God by the patriarchs through the sources of the Pentateuch. The publishers of this volume are to be congratulated for continuing to print such technical material designed primarily for the scholar. BREVARD S. CHILDS YALE DIVINITY SCHOOL 192</page></plain_text>
