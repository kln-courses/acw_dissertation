<plain_text><page sequence="1">An introduction to behavioural ecology.-J. R. Krebs and N. B. Davies. 1981. Sunderland, Massa- chusetts, Sinauer Associates, Inc. 292 pp. $16.50 pa- per, $39.60 cloth.-This is a book "about the survival value of behaviour . . . about competition between individuals for the chance to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations" (p. 1). It is based largely on two main premises: (1) that genes are self- ish and (2) that animals will tend to optimize. These premises are based in turn on the fundamental as- sumption "that animals are well adapted to their en- vironments" (p. 27). Thus, the entire book focuses on the question of how "a particular behavior con- tribute(s) to the animal's inclusive fitness" (p. 28). Predictably occurring (and reoccurring in most cases) buzz words and concepts include "cheaters and sneakers; evolutionary arms races and chases; (ho- mosexual) rape, chastity belts, and transvestites; cuckoldry, sperm competition, and paternity certain-</page><page sequence="2">July 19831 Reviews 785 ty; altruism, inclusive fitness, and kin selection; in- cest and inbreeding; honesty, reliable signals, and manipulation; allocations, investments, and costs and benefits; and selfish genes, optimality models, game theory, and evolutionarily stable strategies." These terms provide both a capsule summary of book con- tent and an index of writing style. Krebs and Davies have produced a highly readable account of "behavioural ecology." Chapters and chapter sections typically begin with a relatively brief general introduction to the topic, followed by de- tailed accounts of example studies. In Chapter 9 ("Co- operation and helping in birds, mammals and fish"), discussions of the Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma coe- rulescens), Pied Kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), Ostrich (Struthio camelus), and Groove-billed Ani (Crotopha- ga sulcirostris) comprise about 101/2 of the 18 pages. In this chapter accounts of bird, mammal, and fish examples cover roughly 11, 3, and 1/3 pages, respec- tively, leaving about 3 pages for more general topics plus 1 page for the Conclusion, Summary, and Fur- ther Reading sections. In another 18-page chapter (2: "Ecology and Adaptation: Comparison between Species"), detailed accounts of weaver birds, African ungulates, and primates comprise about 2, 1, and 9 pages, respectively. Other chapters contain more general commentary than these two, and still others contain detailed accounts of other taxonomic groups (e.g. Chapter 8: "Altemative Strategies," where frogs, crickets, wasps, and fish are featured). Overall, 38 of the 93 photographs and excellent figures, and 13 of the 28 tables, deal directly with birds. The book is highly readable, not only because of the lavish attention to "stories" of animal (and some plant) adaptation, but also because of the "conve- nient and informal shorthand rather than traditional formal scientific style" (p. 3). The style is straight- forward, often given in the form of question-and- answer summaries: e.g. "Why then . . . ? The an- swer is . . ." (p. 154), "Why is it good . . . ? The answer is . . . " (p. 232). Or, behavioral rules are summarized, as "if big, fight; if small, sneak . . . if large, call; if small, be a satellite" (p. 156), or "if large, steal; if small, hunt" (p. 164). Using such a style, the dangers of oversimplification are large; Krebs and Davies do remind the reader of the dan- gers of "handwaving, by thinking up explanations ... without rigorous quantification" (p. 35), and ad- mit that the stories told throughout the book are "inevitably too simple" (p. 247). The advanced stu- dent and researcher soon realize this. For example, characterizing the environment of marine fish as a "giant homogeneous womb," where zygotes are "likely to remain in the same thermal and chemical regime throughout development" (p. 139), does in- justice to the considerable temporal and spatial het- erogeneity in marine environments. While warning of handwaving, though, the authors offer no short- age of "plausible ideas" for adaptation and counter- adaptation. To be fair, however, the authors do sometimes stress that these ideas are merely hypoth- eses. While many behavioral ecologists and sociobiol- ogists have abandoned the use of loaded terms such as rape, transvestite, etc. (and others listed earlier), Krebs and Davies argue that anthropomorphic mo- tivations should not be confused with functional consequences, and that "all the 'ifs' and 'buts' of an impeccably cautious and impregnable account would have made the book twice as long and half as easy to understand" (p. 247). In this style, then, we learn of "gangs" of small fishes "chasing females and stim- ulating them to spawn with the group ('gang bangs')" (p. 166), and that "from the plant's point of view the bee is a flying penis" (p. 230), and that it is no "evo- lutionary surprise ... that our nose cells do not pro- duce sperms or eggs" (p. 199). Science should be fun, and scientists must have a sense of humor; yet casual use of words and analogies, while appropriate in pri- vate, may in public do a developing discipline more harm than good. This informality is further reinforced by use of the first names, or even nicknames, of some scientists, but the rules of use are not always clear. Certain associates, such as Brian, Jane, Nick, Paul, and Rich- ard, are understandable. Curiously, though, Pat re- verts to Patrick (pp. 230, 259), while Robert slips to Bob (pp. 116, 201); Wilson and Hamilton remain E.O. and W.D., and Hinde simply Hinde; embarrassing- ly, Nancy is really Mary Sue (p. 216). Given the premises of the book, it is understand- able that Dawkins and Maynard Smith are featured throughout (their names occur on 25 pages apiece, according to the Author Index). Others occurring on 10 or more pages include Bertram, Brockman, Clut- ton-Brock, Hamilton, Harvey, Krebs, and Parker. The information and 401 references are very current, and a third are 1979 or later, while over half (57%) are 1977 or later. The occasional reference to material "in prep" (as well as the citation of one 1983 paper) gives the impression of an exciting and very fast-moving field, a feature making the book very stimulating. Who will be interested in buying this book? Ac- cording to the back cover of my paper edition, this text is "aimed at second and third year undergrad- uates." It is a simplified version of the co-edited vol- ume, "Behavioural Ecology: an Evolutionary Ap- proach," which was intended more for upperclassmen and beginning graduate students. Given its intended audience, and apart from the writing style and the occasional over-simplifications, I think that the book presents an exciting and intimate view of behavioral ecology for the undergraduate with a good prior in- troductory biology course. The text is well-written, alternative ideas are evaluated and hypothesis-test- ing stressed, transitions from chapter to chapter are logical, figures are professionally done, and detailed comments that are unnecessary for the flow of the</page><page sequence="3">786 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 100 text are confined to 11 "boxes" set aside from the text. Most of the major topics of behavioral ecology are addressed, including the comparative method, optimality theory, group living, defending re- sources, fighting and assessment, sexual selection, mating systems (2 chapters), co-operation and altru- ism (2 chapters), signal design, and coevolution. Se- lected portions of these chapters would be excellent reading for beginning ornithology classes.-DONALD E. KROODSMA.</page></plain_text>
