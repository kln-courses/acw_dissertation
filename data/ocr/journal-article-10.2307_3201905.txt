Joeres in her study of nineteenth-century intellectual women who had a tendency to refeminize themselves by alienating themselves from their intellectual and scholarly achievements, she states that she only studied law because it made her father proud, that she herself, on the other hand, had only ever wanted to marry and have children. Winter's translation reads awkwardly in parts but is an interesting, useful, and novel contribution to Holocaust studies.

New York: Palgrave, 2002. xii + 212 pp. $55.00. Animal Studies is a new and fast-growing field in the humanities. Where in the past science and philosophy seemed to hold court in de- bates about animals, now a wider range of humanities disciplines have entered the debate. "What role do animals play in culture?" these new inquiries ask, articulating concerns that go beyond the use of animal imagery and an attention to historical attitudes towards animals that were the focus in older work. Now there is a more challenging engage- ment. What if we begin to think about the human as not a given, but as a culturally constituted as well as constituting subject? What impact might this have on our relationship with animals? Answers to these questions are currently being offered in exciting and innovative work by a number of scholars who are taking ideas from a range of cultural theories, and the variety of work that is appearing signals that animal studies may be here for a while. Bruce Boehrer's ShakespeareAmong theAnimals is the first monograph- length work with an awareness of some of the current critical debates to look at the role of human-animal relationships in the drama of early modern England. As such it is a welcome addition to the field. How- ever, the book is, it might be said, one of two halves. The framing narrative-the introduction and useful "Suggested Further Reading" section at the end of the book-shows Boehrer's awareness of some of the new work. The core of the book, the four chapters on Shakespeare and his contemporaries, are somewhat more in the tradition of new historicism: interesting, sometimes innovative, but not always clearly engaging with some of the ethical discussions of the first and last parts of the book. 110 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="2">South Atlantic Review So what are the ethical discussions? In his introduction, Boehrer outlines three attitudes that he argues were at work in Shakespeare's day and are still present now: absolute anthropocentrism, relative anthropocentrism, and anthropomorphism. Absolute anthropocentrism proposes humans as superior to and masters of the non-human world; it is what we might call the unpleasant orthodoxy of human-animal relations in the Christian West. Relative anthropocentrism, Boehrer ar- gues, shares much with absolute anthropocentrism (the concept of human superiority remains), but differs in that it "associates large and variable subsets of the human community to a greater or lesser extent with the realm of nature, while reserving full human status only for specific, arbitrarily defined social groups" (17). The "arbitrarily defined social groups" are, almost inevitably, white, literate men. It is from this refusal of a clear and simple human-animal division that the third and most problematic of Boehrer's "attitudes" comes. Anthropomorphism here is not the humanization of animals (the Oxford English Dictionary defines anthropomorphism as the "[a]scription of a human attribute or personality to anything impersonal or irrational") rather, for Boehrer it represents "the unique capacity of human beings to sink below type" (27). What this perception of potential bestialization reveals, he argues, is that in early modern culture "the man/beast opposition ceases to stand for the world as it absolutely is, but stands instead for the world as it absolutely should be" (4). Human degeneration signals an anxiety in the ways in which humans structure the so-called natural world: "nature and culture," as he notes at the end of the book, "are mutually constitu- tive rather than distinct" (181). To take this division of human and animal seriously is to be ap- plauded, and Boehrer opens up some new ways of thinking about some old ideas. In, for example, the second chapter, "The Cuckoo and the Capon," he takes the "commonplace" animal symbol, the cuckold's horns, as his starting point and looks at what he terms "the dilemma of being a man" (98) in the period. The third chapter, the most successful in the book, looks at the changing representations of parrots in the early modern period, and posits a link between colonial exploration and attitudes towards an animal that was fast becoming a popular (if elite) pet in Europe. The parrot, he argues, is linked with the servant, and in literary representations the exploitation of both the bird and the hu- man are rendered, through this association, "inevitable, commonplace, and therefore trivial" (132). However, while the book's title signals an interest in animals, the clear and acknowledged focus is on that most powerful of all creatures, 111</page><page sequence="3">the human. But, Boehrer's translation of anthropomorphism into some- thing that happens to humans as opposed to something that happens to animals in human perception of them seems to allow for a reading that sometimes offers "bestialization" as a kind of symbolic social cat- egory rather than as a natural possibility; that speaks of real animals in its framework but sometimes ends up with mere imagery in other parts without tracing the difference, or the links. This seems to be at odds with Boehrer's stated desire, in both the opening and closing of the book, to engage with political and ethical issues. Of course, this con- centration on the human is inevitable: when reading the animals in early modem drama we are always reading human constructions of animals, and the critic of past cultures must deal with this issue, must think about the limitations of his/her field and how they might be used ethi- cally. To relocate the human is, I think, one logical possibility. However, while Boehrer does this, once into his Shakespearean work the ethics do seem to get rather left behind. The three categories of thought that he sets up become ways of reading some of the plays of the period and it is not always clear how these readings go beyond liter- ary studies. ShakespeareAmong theAnimals is simultaneously a frustrating and interesting book. It takes the possibility of the constructed nature of the human in early modern drama seriously, but at the same time, it makes certain claims-claims about the cultural and ethical significance of ecocriticism, for example-that it does not really address explicitly in its central chapters. The essays do, though, propose the possibility of taking animals, even those at the heart of the literary canon, seriously, and perhaps this is their importance. As Boehrer says at the end of his suggestions for further reading, "I hope this book may encourage read- ers to dig into the wider body of literature with which I have concluded this study" (182).
