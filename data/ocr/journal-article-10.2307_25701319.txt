I have suggested elsewhere, and on various occasions too, that one way in which modern art history could or should be rewritten is as a history of friendships - of loves, hates, intimacies, and longings: the "politics of friendship." The aforemen tioned longing certainly is a (if not the) major force in art, and one that has perhaps not been fully understood, let alone theorized, yet; Theodor Adorno himself, to whom we shall be returning towards the end of this essay, asserted that "there is no valid artwork without longing" - nor can there be any valid art history, art theory or art criticism without longing. But this is just an introductory aside - something to look into on another occasion. One day, one such history of modern (twentieth-century) and contemporary (twenty-first-century) art will surely be written from the point of view of art's love-hate relationship with the realm of the spiritual, of the mystical, the transcendental, the occult (magic, hermeticism, esotericism), and various other forms and regimes of what can generally be referred to as "religious experience" - a history of art's eternal (and eternally recurring) doubt as to whether it is part of the disenchantment of the world, or of its continuing (re-) enchantment instead.1 It is sufficiently clear, of course, that we are once again finding ourselves to the (far) right side of this endless pendular motion, that of seemingly boundless enchant ment - a simple fact attested by the sheer number of exhibitions (chock-full of contemporary work) that have been devoted, in the last couple of years, to notions of the sacred, the occult, the mystical, the magical, and its various aesthetic accoutrements and manifestations (belief, darkness, delirium, ecstasy, enigma, interiority, metamorphosis, opacity, seance, shadow play, silence etc.), and symbolically enshrined (no pun intended) in the belated induction of latter-day Capitalist Realist Gerhard Richter into the official pantheon of ecclesiastical artists - a reference to Richter's fabulous Domfenster design for the Cologne Cathedral, named as the defining artistic event of 2007 (and not for some arid cynical reason) by none other than Benjamin Buchloh/ once the foremost Marxist art critic of his generation, who will perhaps be best remembered for his ruthless dismantling (back when such an operation was still deemed necessary, in the salad days of postmodernism) of the Beuys myth.' Not for a long time has the art world been as willing, ready and able as today to truly believe (clearly the operative verb here) Bruce Nauman when he asserted that "the true artist helps the world by revealing mystic truths" - the spiraling neon sign which greeted pilgrims at the entrance of the exhibition Traces of the Sacred held at the Centre Pompidou in Paris last year, probably the biggest single landmark event of its kind.4 [Another striking instance of mass conversion took place in the turbine halls of the Tate some years ago, under the all-seeing solar I of Olafur Eliasson's Weather Project - to which we shall be returning shortly.] Merely listing the number of exhibitions as well as artistic practices - for these exhibitions are not just curatorial fantasies, but also made up of real examples of artists' fantasies - that could be considered as somehow illustrative of this admittedly polemical observation would take up both far more than the space allotted to me in these few pages, as well as far too much of my own time. [Once again, I would like to refer the interested reader to my essay published in Afterall #20, see note 1J In any case, I am not out to 'prove' a certain argument here; after all, I have contributed myself in no small measure to this curious cultural obsession in con temporary art, thanks to my curatorial participation in a series of exhibition projects titled "All That Is Solid Melts Into Air: Five Reflections On Materialist Spirituality" (see note 1). It is probably much more interesting and enlightening to at least attempt to explain why this cultural obsession has emerged with such cationic force - why art desires the spiritual (or at least desires its address) with such fiery passion and zealous impatience: why enigma and transcendence now? 31</page><page sequence="3">32 Part of the answer to this impossibly broad question - and its many answers can only be articulated piecemeal, so this is perhaps just one faint glimmer of one attempt at beginning to modestly do so - must lie in the recent past, i.e. in recent world events - events that have long been of such a depressing nature as to absolutely discourage anyone from longing to be part of this world, instead instilling in everyone a perfectly normal desire to dream of escape into an other, non-existent world (escapism is clearly at the heart of this mass-scale infatuation with the otherworldly): into the transcendent and the spiritual, into magic and mysticism, into "that whereof one cannot speak" and perforce must remain forever silent - silence itself being a manifestation of such a desire for the mystical alternative to the present world (order). The recent past, then - let us go back to 2003, for instance, the year of Olafur Eliasson's aforementioned Weather Project, among many other such projects.5 Most of the previous year, the Bush administration's first full year in office, had been consumed by the global geopolitical obsession with a new 'ideological' specter, this time not just haunting Europe, but the world in its entirety: terror. In March 2003, these globalized politics of fear culminated in the unlawful invasion of Iraq by Bush's so-called "coalition of the willing." The obvious criminality of Operation Iraqi Freedom provoked the largest anti-war protest of all time to flood the streets of some 800 cities around the world on February 15, 2003, with the estimated number of protesters ranging from ten to thirty million. According to the BBC, "the demonstration in London was the biggest in the UK capital's political history, with nearly two million taking part," and according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the three million people who gathered in Rome made it the largest anti-war rally in history. I was in Mexico at the time, and participated in a demonstration in Mexico City with some 10,000 kindred souls - not terribly impressive for the world's second largest city, I even thought to myself then. Now we all remember, of course, that in the end this didn't make the slightest difference: a little over four weeks later the first American bombs were dropped on Baghdad and the rest, as they say, is history. The largest anti-war protest of all time proved miserably, pitifully powerless: no wonder that the remaining five years of the Bush presidency were characterized in the main by a deep-seated sense of resignation permeating all layers of (Western) society and (Western) cultural life, by "inner exile" (a historically fraught phrase), by escape and dreamy withdrawal into both intro- and retrospection, by depoliticization, mystification ('enchantment') and frightful hedonist apathy - and this wholesale retreat beyond the horizon of reason, precisely, is the background against which some of the defining features of the contemporary art scene of the last eight years or so should be read: 1) the unprecedented boom of the art market as demonstrated by the seemingly ceaseless proliferation of galleries and art fairs around the world, as well as by the exponential growth in numbers of pages devoted to advertising in the world's leading art magazines; 2) the rewriting of recent art history to allow for the 'invention' of such new paradigms as Romantic Conceptualism and the concomitant cultivation of a certain willed marginalism (the artist loser as a Quixotic hero); and 3) the revival of 'spiritual' concerns (channelled through artistic appropriations of magical and occultist practices and techniques) in art proper. As I mentioned before, there are many ways to explain the return of (as well as the return to) the 'spiritual in art', and there are just as many reasons why art should both indulge and be allowed to indulge in the fantasy of enchantment at this point in time - but precisely this 'point in time' is crucial to our proper societal understanding of the phenomenon: the current infatuation with mysticism and occultism in art - with whatever lies outside of the world - reflects a political state of affairs in the world, and is in itself part of a global political landscape, or rather, symptom of a global political pathology. Why dream of magic? Perhaps because only 'magic,' in all its mesmerizing naivety, really promises us the possibility of deliverance or escape (Houdini!) from the world as we know it today - not a nice or interesting place to be, most of the time.6 In this sense, art, as Stendhal's revered promesse de bonheur, has always been magic, and magic has always been art - nihil nove sub sole. Why seek the tenebrous extremes of the subconscious, the oth erworldly and the irrational? Because we have long been familiar with the diabolical dialectic of enlightenment, of the so-called reasonable and rational. And why long to 'transcend' this earthly vale of tears in a blaze of quasi religious fervour? Perhaps because it is precisely that, most of the time: an earthly vale of tears. A world that in a sense deserves (or begs) to be bathed in the musty, incense-scented twilight of contemporary art's fuzzy,' post-secular' mystique. I should perhaps conclude by returning to my own contribution to contemporary art's ongoing dialogue with, and participation in, what has been called "the return of religion and other myths."7</page><page sequence="4">The exhibition I curated as part of the larger exhibition series titled All That Is Solid Melts Into Air, on view in the Belgian town of Mechelen this spring, was simply titled The Thing. It consisted, rather unimaginatively perhaps (but that was probably part of the point), almost entirely of sculptural work - things, not objects.0 There was one moving-image work (a four-monitor video piece by Vancouver artist Judy Radul, installed in the exhibition's antechamber) and one suite of nine black-and-white photographs by Brussels-based artist duo Jos de Gruyter &amp; Harald Thys, but other than that the show's four main spaces were filled by things that stand, lie, lean or hang: cubes (by Gabriel Kuri and Steven Shearer), spheres (by Mark Soo and Elizabeth Zvonar), columns and screens (by Eva Berendes, Camilla Low and Valerie Mannaerts), magical wands (by Andre Cadere) and life-like but ulti mately lifeless human figures (by Francesco Gennari, Thomas Houseago and Goshka Macuga). A graveyard as much as a cabinet of curiosities, then: static, silent, morbid, slightly dumb even - but above all material (as opposed to merely materialist), in the base, Bataillan sense of sheer matter, raw stuff. At the entrance of the exhibition, a single quote culled from Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractactus Logico-Philosophicus, the paragraph number of which (6.44) has been gracing my shoulder blades ever since I turned thirty: "not how the world is, but that it is, is the mystical" - meant to 'prove' the project's philosophical allegiance and attachment to the world, not its negation. There were many great pieces in this show, but perhaps the most emblematic and programmatic is the dumbest of all - that which most literally embodies the hard-headed, mute materiality of real enigma, the enigma of the world rather than its mystical, transcendent obverse: Gabriel Kuri's Untitled (One Cube) (2006), a hollow cube covered in black tar paper and measuring one by one by one meter, that, whenever picked up (though this is obviously not what the visitor or viewer is meant to 'do' with it) makes a sound - that of an unidentified object rolling around in the cube's impenetrable innards. "A riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma," in the words used by Churchill to derscribe Soviet Russia. I, as a curator, happen to know what's inside the cube however - because the artist told me what that 'secret' object is. Yet why should I believe him? Granted, the work comes with one powerful clue - but that doesn't really matter here: to a certain extent (that of artistic and plainly intellectual success) the work does for me what the minimalist monolith does for the hirsute hominids in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Oddysey: it doesn't so much represent complete and absolute wonder at the enigma of the thing, as much as present the moody, lugubrious marvel of being as such - why indeed there is some-thing rather than just no-thing.9 Olafur Eliasson The Weather project 2003 installation shot, Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London (The Unilever Series) monofrequency lights, projection foil, haze machine, mirror foil, aluminium, and scaffolding 26.7m x 22.3m x 155.4m courtesy the artist/ neugemem schneider, Berlin/ Tanya Bonakdar, New York/ ? Tate 33</page><page sequence="5">34 This observation about the everyday enigmaticalness of that which is just, immovably, there (or rather, 'here' - for it is clear that 'thereness' may already apply a quality of transcending otherness) finally leads us back to Theodor Adorno - the late Adorno of Aesthetic Theory that is, the philosopher's final magisterial balancing act between abject despair and a feverish, longing belief in possibility. In the aptly titled chapter "Enigmaticalness, Truth Content, Metaphysics," Adorno muses that "the enigmaticalness of artworks is less their irrationality than their rationality; the more methodically they are ruled, the more sharply their enigmaticalness is thrown into relief."10 With this sobering insight, the work of art - not the artist, not his or her artistic practice, but the work pure and simple - is put back in the terrifying glare of an insomniac reason, of a certain harsh rationality that will never be put to sleep (if only for fear of its producing monsters). This Adornian work of art, this emblem of thingness which I have sought to theorize, stands not so much at the gates of transcendence, as - and here it becomes a cipher of radical immanence - at the limits of enchantment.

Finally, the 'problem' of art and its relationship to any claim of spirituality and/or religiosity is at the center of an exhibition I recently co curated at the Cultural Center in Mechelen, Belgium, organized by the Antwerp Museum of Contemporary Art MuHKA, this exhibition was titled "All That Is Solid Melts Into Air" and subtitled "Five Reflections On Materialist Spirituality." I will be returning to this exhibition project later on in this essay. 2 On December 2007 issue of Artforum, New York. 3 Joseph Beuys was the subject of what was probably one of the best solo and/or retrospective exhibitions on view in Berlin this year: tellingly, "Joseph Beuys: Die Revolution sind Wir", held at the Hamburger Bahnhof museum of contemporary art, was the first such event to be organized in Germany as a whole since the protean artist's death in 1986. Much to the credit of the exhibition curators and organizers, "Die Revolution sind wir" presented a supremely balanced picture of Beuys the-shaman (or charlatan) alongside Beuys-the-activist (or political animal). 4 I started writing this essay some time before the opening of the 53^ Venice Biennial; this having long since become a dreary festival of certainties not discoveries, the longest queue snaking around the giardini unsurprisingly led up to an American pavilion housing a selection of Bruce Nauman's well-known neon pieces. Apart from its depressing predictability (which culminated in Nauman's acceptance of the Golden Lion award for the best national pavilion), the giardini-wide ubiquity of queues was perhaps the one defining feature of this year's biennial - part pilgrimage, part procession, both leading up to the artist's final revelation of mystic truths. Les traces du sacr? or Traces of the Sacred travelled to Munich's Haus der Kunst in the fall of 2008 5 Selected parts of what follows have appeared, in a slightly altered fashion, in an essay titled "After the Histonographic Turn: Current Findings", published in the online e-flux journal #6, May 2009, see h ttp://www. e - flux, com/ journal/vie w/60 6 If the world looks like it can again become a better and more interesting place to be (in), after the ignominious end of the Bush era, this will obviously also influence the production and reception of art in the years to come - but we are clearly (and I am now speaking from the point of view of a visitor to the most recent Venice Biennial, the biggest event on the global art calendar) not there yet. 7 This is a reference to a research project initiated by Maria Havajova at BAK center for contemporary art in Utrecht, Netherlands, that sought to explore "the popular assumption of the return of religion to the public sphere, contemporary politics, and the media in the West as a constitutive "myth." Along with Boris Grays' &amp; Peter Weibel's Medium Religion, organized at the ZKM in Karlsruhe, this has been one of a few exhibition projects to look at the phenomenon of a perceived, presumed or projected awakening of religious sentiment and spiritual longing from the critical point of view of an enlightened, incorrigibly disenchanted skepticism. 8 The distinction between 'thing' and 'object' is at the heart of any thing theory, and certainly also at the center of mine, as it was both expounded in the exhibition and in a series of essays and lectures that led up to the project, among others in the context of the Fifth Berlin Biennial curated by Adam Szymczyk and Elena Filipovic in 2008 - itself an important exhibition that was not entirely without certain mystical undertones. 9 The reference to Kubrick's iconic monolith is not as innocent as one may think here, the minimalist, slightly anthropomorphic (or at least anthropometric) monolith was a recurring motif throughout the 2007 Documenta, curated by Roger Buergel and Ruth Noack, as represented by the very thing-like sculptures of John McCracken; this is yet another influential curatorial landmark along the trajectory of art's ambiguous, doubt-ridden relationship with spiritual enchantment and/or ironic disenchantment. 10 Theodor Adorno, Aesthetic theory, London: Continuum, 1997, p 120 35</page></plain_text>
