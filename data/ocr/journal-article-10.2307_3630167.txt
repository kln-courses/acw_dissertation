<plain_text><page sequence="1">SITE USE, PICTORIAL SPACE, AND SUBJECT MATTER IN LATE PREHISTORIC AND EARLY HISTORIC RIO GRANDE PUEBLO ARTi J.J. Brody Department of Art and Art History, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS the Pueblo IV murals that we know of are composed within framed spaces on one or more walls of a kiva. Their subject matter generally suggests that the pictures, as well as the room that contained them, served some ritual functions. Images of animals, deities, and kachinas and symbols and paraphernalia associated with the sacred domain dominate. The beings that are pictured often appear in narrative relationships that suggest mythological events, or they are shown in static, hieratic poses that imply differential power. Pueblo IV rock art found at open-air sites is also dominated by pictures of animals, deities, and kachinas and by symbols and paraphernalia associated with the sacred domain. But many animals and anthropomorphs in rock art have no clear connection to ritual, while the kachina and deity images are seldom shown in narrative context and are only occasionally posed in domi- nating, hieratic fashion. That the range of subjects is also much broader than in contemporary kiva murals may reflect nothing more than sheer numbers: there are many more known examples of rock art than of kiva paintings. Not only is there more rock art, but it is far more widely distributed than kiva murals and was probably made by people from many more communities of diverse linguistic, cultural, and historical backgrounds. Thus the iconography of Pueblo IV rock art may represent a far greater diversity of meanings and traditions than does that of contemporaneous kiva murals. Differences in imagery and style between these two kinds of pictorial art may also reflect functional differences between the two types of art sites. Most pictures at open-air sites are found in clusters but are less formally organized than kiva murals, and their ritual associations are less easily established. In contrast with wall-painting sites, there is great variety in the types of locations where the art was made. Rock-art sites may be near to or far from villages, water sources, or animal trails, and their configurations are quite variable. Unlike kivas and most other wall-painting locations, which can be identified with a limited range of ritual activities, rock-art sites, as well as rock-art imagery, probably served diverse purposes. However, few obvious clues about the way the art was made and perhaps used at open-air sites suggest alter- natives to classifying these places as if they were all members of the same basic category. For these reasons, discussion of rock-art pictures as ceremonial art objects generally proceeds on a picture-by-picture basis, as though the art and the art sites were essentially independent of each other. 15</page><page sequence="2">16 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH These typological problems will be considered here, primarily by examining the imagery and formal characteristics of pictures from two well-known rock- art sites that are roughly contemporaneous with Pueblo IV mural-painting locations. The physical characteristics of these outdoor art spaces are initially examined less in terms of their potential utility as ritual areas than to note how art production interacted with the physical configurations of the art sites. Such an examination is an essential prerequisite to any analysis of art, for pictorial images and the surfaces on which they are made are interdependent, rather than independent of each other. Classification of artistic images alone can be of little interpretive value, because, in the end, observation of the ways that artists use their chosen pictorial spaces is necessary to refine an understanding of how images and the locations where they occur serve any people. THE SITES: ABO PAINTED ROCKS AND SAN CRISTOBAL PETROGLYPHS Most of the art at the two sites to be considered-Ab6 Painted Rocks and San Crist6bal--is contemporaneous. The sites also come close to representing the range of variability in pictorial form and content exhibited by middle Rio Grande rock art of the Pueblo IV era. Formal distinctions that may relate to differences in media, as between pictographs and petroglyphs, and to variations in the morphology of the art-site location, as between a rock shelter and a boulder field, are well represented. Of a great number of open-air sites that could be used for analytical purposes, these two are among the best docu- mented and are particularly well suited to broad, synoptic comparative analysis. The Ab6 paintings are in a sandstone rock shelter located near the ruins of the Tompiro-speaking community of Ab6, one of the Salinas pueblos east of the Rio Grande and south of Albuquerque. The San Crist6bal petroglyphs are found on basalt outcrops and boulders scattered on a hillside above the ruins of the southern Tewa- (Tano-) speaking village of the same name east of Santa Fe. Most pictures at both places can reasonably be attributed to people from the nearby communities which were occupied from about the thirteenth through the seventeenth centuries. In both cases the surrounding countryside became heavily populated by incoming peoples after about A.D. 1250. In about 1672 the people of the Ab6 area moved to the Rio Grande Valley near Socorro, and they dispersed after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, some among them joining Tiwa-speaking Sandia Pueblo (Cole 1984:13-14; Schroeder 1979:241). San Crist6bal was abandoned between 1680 and 1692, many of its people moving first to northern Tewa territory and then, by 1716, to the Hopi First Mesa, to be counted among the ancestors of the modem Hopi-Tewa people of Hano Pueblo (Dozier 1954, 1970; Schroeder 1979:247-48; Sims 1949, 1963:215-16). Both sites therefore overlap with the major Pueblo IV mural- art sites to which they must be compared: Kuaua and Pottery Mound in the Rio Grande district and Awatovi and Kawaika-a at Hopi, all dating between the</page><page sequence="3">RIO GRANDE PUEBLO ART 17 late fourteenth and the late sixteenth centuries (Dutton 1963; Hibben 1975; Smith 1952). No kiva murals are known from the village sites nearest these two rock-art locations, but they have been reported from nearby contemporary communi- ties, most notably Las Humanas (Gran Quivira), the largest of the Salinas pueblos. Seventeenth-century murals were also found in rooms at Las Humanas that had no kiva features (Peckham 1981:15-38). Less is known about the murals reported from several rooms at sites in or near the Galisteo Basin not far from San Crist6bal (Lambert 1954; Nelson 1914; Tichy 1938). Other im- pressive rock-art sites with many similarities and some differences to the two described below are located within a few miles of each site. Many iconographic and stylistic features indicate that the art found at all of these open-air sites is related to kiva murals. ABO PAINTED ROCKS: FORM AND IMAGERY The Ab6 Painted Rocks site, about 120 meters long, is located about one kilometer south of Ab6 Pueblo but is not visible from it. A major pass in the Manzano Mountains between the Rio Grande Valley and the salt lakes that give the Salinas pueblos their name is adjacent to the site. Its major feature is a high, shallow rock shelter, about 30 meters long, in which are many painted pictures that resemble figures in kiva murals (Cole 1984) (Figure 1). Scattered engravings, some of which share imagery with the paintings, are found on nearby boulders, but the majority of these petroglyphs are heavily patinated Figure 1. Overview of the Ab6 Painted Rocks Rock-Art Site, Looking North</page><page sequence="4">18 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH and more closely resemble thirteenth-century Mogollon rock art of western New Mexico. Conversely, some of the paintings in the shelter and along ad- joining cliff walls are distinctly different from the majority and may relate to the heavily patinated petroglyphs rather than to the Pueblo IV Ab6 community. Except that they were made directly on the sandstone walls of the rock shelter rather than on a plastered surface, the technology of most of the paintings, including color range and paint application methods, appears quite similar to that of contemporary kiva murals (Cole 1984:21-23). Much of the imagery is also similar in style and detail to kiva wall paintings. Large-scale anthropomorphs are shown full face or in profile, with elaborate headdresses, masks, facial paint, body paint, kilts, belts, and other costume elements typical of kiva-mural figures (Figure 2). They are flatly painted and may exhibit the use of contour lines or other visual devices to separate the different blocks of color within each figure that are descriptive of its body parts, costume, and paraphernalia. As in many kiva murals, forward-facing figures tend to be presented in static poses, with upper bodies bilaterally symmetrical, arms raised and bent upward at the elbows, and legs bent at the knees and either facing forward or both turned in the same direction. The more active of the large figures are usually shown in a side view, heads in profile, with each gesturing hand gripping an object. Figures painted in kiva murals are invariably posed against flat, neutral backgrounds within framed spaces at about eye level on a vertical wall. In sharp contrast, the largest, most elaborate, and most dominant of the Ab6 painted figures are placed well above eye level on the overhanging, arched ceiling of the rock shelter and are confused with the naturally colorful, textured, unframed background spaces (Figure 3). Further, the configuration of the stone walls and ceiling of the shelter adds another spatial dimension to the paintings- they bulge and flow with the disconformities of the stone, which gives them a dimensional quality quite different from that of paintings on the smoothed, vertical walls of a Pueblo room. Cole (1984:27-38) identifies some of the masked figures with historically documented kachinas and with the rituals associated with them at some pueblos today. She also identifies some masks with those pictured at kiva-mural sites, especially Kuaua. In addition, some shield figures here resemble those from Pottery Mound, and the feathered and horned serpents, four-pointed stars, and stars with painted faces and legs all have counterparts on the walls of the major kiva-mural sites. Also depicted is a prominent Koshare-like figure with striped arms and legs who interacts with a feathered serpent (Cole 1984: cover, 29-31) (see Figure 2). Similar personages are known in the prehistoric and historic rock art of the Pajarito Plateau and Galisteo Basin, and they also occur in twentieth-century Keresan ritual murals (Cole 1984:31, fig. 2; White 1932:pl.l.lla, b). Feathered and/or horned serpents are ubiquitous in late Pueblo IV and Historic period art. Among the small paintings in and near the shelter are red stick figures that</page><page sequence="5">RIO GRANDE PUEBLO ART 19 a. c. Figure 2. Painted Figures at Ab6 Painted Rocks Left to right: a, standing figure with spiky headdress; b, weatherworn Koshare-like figure next to a homed and feathered serpent facing downward; c-d, two barely visible standing humans.</page><page sequence="6">20 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Figure 3. Superimposed Painted Figures High on the Ceiling at Ab6 Painted Rocks Note stenciled outline of a human hand in the center and superimposed figures to the right. bear some similarity to much older Mogollon Red Style pictographs (Schaafsma 1980:183). Suspicion that these may be older and unrelated to the other paint- ings at the site is supported by the presence nearby of both heavily patinated rock engravings and Mogollon pithouse villages (Caperton 1981:3, 4, 10). The red stick-figure paintings and other, equally small polychromatic paintings that more closely resemble kiva murals are the only paintings at Ab6 that obviously describe narrative relationships. Many of these small polychrome figures are masked, wear costumes, and carry paraphernalia that clearly identify them with kachinas. Others carry shields, bows, and other equipment which suggest affiliation with hunting, curing, and warrior societies. All tend to be long-waisted but are otherwise quite realis- tically proportioned, and their naturalism is emphasized by active postures and drawn details (Figure 4). Unlike the larger painted figures on the ceiling of the shelter, many of the smaller ones are less than prominent and seem to have been deliberately placed in locations that are hidden or virtually inaccessible. Erosion and vandalism have taken their toll at the Ab6 site, thereby making iconographic identification difficult and disguising pictorial relationships. How- ever, it appears that all of the human and humanoid figures, no matter how large, small, or interactive, were subject to superimposition. The nearest that any come to being composed within framed picture spaces are groups of small figures on horizontal boulders, near the base of the rock shelter, which are isolated from its mass by physical position as well as small scale. Several distinct styles of painting are present at this one site: large poly- chromed figures that are hieratic and prominent, small polychromed ones that</page><page sequence="7">RIO GRANDE PUEBLO ART 21 Figure 4. Small Painted Figures at the Base of Ab6 Painted Rocks On the left, a pair of red-outlined, white-bodied, bent-legged figures face each other, each holding a bow, string side out. occasionally interact and are often naturalistic, and monochromatic, linear stick figures which seem unrelated to the other two categories. Each of the two polychromed styles provides complex visual effects which may or may not have been intended. The large dominant images are immediately attractive by scale and position. That attraction is enhanced by the textural complexity of super- positioning and the confusion of the colorful images with the naturally rich colors and textures of the rock walls. The images have a surreal character, merging with and emerging from the living rock as though all were components of a single organism. In visual counterpoint to this powerful illusion, the small paintings are almost invisible and, when found, seem to emerge from, rather than merge with, the picture surface. They must be searched for, and the very process of search and discovery adds to their interactive, narrative qualities. The combination of visual, pictorial, tactile, and narrative qualities, the natural and man-made effects, and the very necessary participation of the viewer combine to make the entire rock shelter a single work of art with a very contemporary flavor. It could almost be an elaborate environmental construction made by some postmodern artist. SAN CRISTOBAL PETROGLYPHS: FORM AND SUBJECT Unlike the Ab6 rock shelter, which is a well-defined, naturally framed space, the San Crist6bal open-air art site covers many acres. It is a rambling, poorly defined site that includes both many huge boulders scattered over the talus</page><page sequence="8">22 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH slope of a mesa and the steep basalt walls of the mesa caprock (Figure 5). San Crist6bal Pueblo is only a few hundred meters to the northeast and is easily seen from the rock-art site. Most pictures here are pecked and engraved on the basalt, but a few in sheltered locations are painted and share iconographic and technical features with the Ab6 paintings. Even though the Ab6 site is framed by its rock shelter, the images placed within that frame seem to have been no more deliberately organized into a unified composition than were those scattered over the landscape at San Crist6bal. In both sites some groups of images may have been intended to interact, but in neither is the whole ever treated as a single composition. The variety of imagery at San Crist6bal is enormous, including humans, anthropomorphic figures, humanoid animals, masks, masked figures, stars, meanders, circles, and other abstract or nonrepresentational motifs. Some images are massed in inchoate groupings, others are interacting and narrative; some are ritualistic and obviously symbolic, others are prosaic, genre, almost trivial (Sims 1949, 1963). As well as space, the images share age and tech- nology. Except for some that are more deeply patinated and possibly quite older, the patination of the majority is generally of about the same quality, and most images seem to be contemporaneous. Almost all were made by pecking and abrading, and the quality and style of workmanship is both fairly uniform and of a high order. The medium used generally forbids precision and lacks color, so detailed comparisons of masks, costumes, and paraphernalia with either kiva murals or Figure 5. Petroglyphs on Boulders at the Base at the Basalt Mesa at the Center of the San Crist6bal Rock-Art Site</page><page sequence="9">RIO GRANDE PUEBLO ART 23 painted rock art cannot be made. Nonetheless, a list of images that correspond to those in kiva murals is quite long and includes feathered serpents, homed serpents, four-pointed stars with faces and legs, parrots and other birds, shield figures, and kachina masks. Some of these images can be identified with several pictured at Kuaua and may also be identical to modem kachina personages (Sims 1949, 1963:214-20). The two rock-art sites differ from each other in many respects, but individual pictures and groups of pictures at each are organized in much the same way. At both places a few panels show figures interacting with each other, but most images at each site are not clustered in any obvious kind of visual or narrative relationship. No geologic features at San Crist6bal are equivalent to the high- ceilinged rock shelter of Ab6; but many pictures high on the walls of the caprock are almost as dominating as the ceiling paintings at Ab6, and some San Crist6bal petroglyphs are as large and visually powerful as any of the Ab6 paintings (Figure 6). Several compositions at San Crist6bal begin low on the cliff walls and rise upward in complex and powerful visual masses that were composed over time by the agglomeration of separate images drawn by different artists. Far more than the Ab6 shelter, which can be perceived as a single, very large picture space, San Crist6bal is a congeries of many pictorial clusters. That some of these expanded to join with others testifies to the dynamic process which created the art there. Because of differences in media and raw materials, the evocative quality and ??L~-: " ;?.?~L~?~ *r;.lYh ? . I~ I?fi F:-s~e ?r~p? . Ir~31181~ id i ,.? PI ?E": C ..

Superpositioning, which at Ab6 creates sensually rich abstract colors and textures, at San Crist6bal, where it is far less common, usually has the effect of merely obscuring a drawn image. However, an almost sculptural concern for the aesthetic and expressive values that are potential in the interplay of line with volume is evident at San Crist6bal. Many figures are simply linear engravings on more or less flat planes of the hard stone, but many others are patterned to shift planes with the stone and are textured by a variety of pecking techniques. These textures combine with the flowing lines to integrate the imposed images with the planes and massive volume of the boulders on which they are placed (Figure 7). SYNTHESIS: ROCK ART AND WALL PAINTINGS The almost anarchic lack of planned pictorial organization at Pueblo IV open- air art sites, so similar to older Anasazi pictorial treatment at other locations, is in strong contrast to the compositional rationality of most kiva murals, which seem always to be guided by a single intelligence. The pictorial surfaces at Ab6 and San Crist6bal were patterned out as their images accumulated: many of their compositions are additive, progressive, accretional, and, in the end, the product of the last artist who happened to work on a panel, boulder, or Figure 7. Petroglyphs near the Base of the Basalt Mesa at the San Crist6bal Rock-Art Site Note how the pecked images articulate with the natural contours, fault lines, and planes of the rock.</page><page sequence="11">RIO GRANDE PUEBLO ART 25 section of a picture (Young 1985:8, 24-29). These very distinct classes of composition are site-related: different kinds of art sites had different kinds of pictorial logic. Did the art also serve different purposes and the sites different functions? These pictorial logics sometimes overlapped: small rectangular surfaces at Ab6 could be treated as framed picture spaces, and a great concave boulder at San Crist6bal was also organized as if it were a framed space. As subtle and delicate as a painting, the drawing on that rock centers upon an upward-flying birdlike creature whose body overlies a zigzag line that suggests lightning (Figure 8). Bertha Dutton (1963:148-50, figs. 14 and 69a, b) identifies similar subjects at Kuaua as bats on lightning and associates them with rainmaking ceremonies. The San Crist6bal picture can also reasonably be interpreted as illustrating an incident in a widely shared Pueblo emergence myth wherein a bird searches for a route from the Underworld to an upper level (Benedict 1931; Nequatewa 1967:7-23; Courlander 1982:3-10). However it is identified, the artist who engraved this compelling image created a bilaterally symmetrical planar composition on a surface that was made energetic by precise linear qualities. Its conceptual similarity to the controlled compositions of kiva murals is emphasized by the similarity in size and pro- portion of the boulder to the walls of a kiva and by the placement of the picture, as in most wall paintings, at eye level. Other unrelated pictures on the boulder Figure 8. Large, Free-Standing Boulder near the Base of the San Crist6bal Rock-Art Site The arc just left of the central zigzag line is recent, and the running figure to its left may also be modem.</page><page sequence="12">26 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH done at a later time by a different hand distort the visual relationships, and the tense, balanced composition was modified and diminished by accretion. Perhaps less obvious as intellectually controlled compositions, but equally impressive because of the way they define their surrounding picture spaces, are several mask or face drawings located high on the San Crist6bal caprock. These resemble the Ogre, or Natashka, Kachinas who appear annually at the Hopi Powamu ceremonies (Fewkes 1903:31-38; Kealiinohomoku 1980:37-69), and the iconography may also relate to that of the Mexican rain deity Tlaloc (Ellis and Hammack 1968; Schaafsma 1980:199ff.). Their large round eyes appear to protrude, and their rectangular, muzzlelike mouths have large ser- rated teeth which resemble the horizontal "lightning lines" that are so common in Anasazi and Pueblo pottery painting. The figures stare straight ahead; some have no facial outlines but are defined only by eyes, mouths, and sometimes ears engraved upon the rock. These startling, minimal images are given great presence by their placement and the draftsmanship of significant detail. They dominate the boulders on which they were made, and few are impinged upon by later drawings. Although similar minimalist images are found at other rock- art locations in the Rio Grande and Jornado Mogollon regions, they are rarely as impressive as those at San Crist6bal. Other boulders at San Crist6bal and some panels at Ab6 confirm the impres- sion that at least some open-site artists were as self-conscious about com- position as were kiva muralists. Conversely, a few Pueblo IV mural paintings appear to be as boundless and randomly composed as most rock-art pictures, and some were subject to superimposition. At both Awatovi and Pottery Mound, extraneous graffiti were placed over some well-organized kiva murals (Smith 1952:fig. 92; Hibben 1975), and murals at Las Humanas were unframed, asym- metrically composed, and quite casually organized (Hayes, Young, and Warren 1981:46-53; Peckham 1981:15-38). The similarities in size, scale, proportion, and iconography between the Las Humanas murals and many pictures at Ab6 and other Tompiro open-air sites suggest a regional style that blurred distinc- tions between wall paintings and rock art. But few kiva murals were organized as though they were rock-art pictures, and unframed pictures at open-air sites were rarely as highly structured as framed kiva murals. These site-related distinctions remained dynamic even after pictures were completed. The most tightly organized picture at an open- air site was far more vulnerable than any wall painting to accidental or deliberate modifications. Over time, compositions might be so altered as to disguise the intent of the artist and to destroy their original quality. In rare instances, most commonly in the Tompiro area, a picture at an open-air site was covered over and the surface prepared before a new picture was made on that spot (Cole 1984:24). Such was the rule for kiva murals, which, rather than being gradually overburdened with new images, were almost always whitewashed over and then repainted in their entirety. A kiva mural might be erased, but it was rarely disfigured. Nonetheless, superimposition and erasure are both acts of com- pletion-unambiguous, graphic evidence that a picture has become obsolete, used up, finished.</page><page sequence="13">RIO GRANDE PUEBLO ART 27 Therefore, accretion of images could have been to a rock-art site what overpainting with white plaster was to kiva murals. Each procedure replaced one picture with another, but each expressed a different value that was given to the art, both the old picture which was to be replaced and the new one that was to be made in its stead. Similar kinds of subject matter may look very much the same on room walls or in the open, but the differences in replacement procedures correlate very nicely with the two fundamentally different com- positional principles that characterized each class of site. Rather than subject matter, it appears that the way pictures were composed and how they were treated when they were to be replaced identified them, the surfaces on which they were made, and the sites where they were located as having differing ideological as well as aesthetic values.
