<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "end of philosophy11? BY CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS We are living through a protracted crisis of Western society and culture. The diagnosis is not invalidated by its in- numerable repetitions - from Rousseau and the romantics through Nietzsche, Spengler, Trotsky to Heidegger and beyond. In fact the very ways along which many among these authors and others have tried to establish it are in themselves symptoms of the crisis and belong to it. To the crisis belong also the proclamation - especially, but not only, by Heidegger - of "the end of philosophy" and the whole array of deconstructionist and postmodernist rhetoric. Philosophy is a central element of the Greek-Western project of individual and social autonomy; the end of philosophy would mean no more and no less than the end of freedom. Freedom is threatened not only by totalitarian or authoritarian regimes, but also, in a more hidden but no less deep fashion, by the waning of conflict and critique, the spreading of amnesia and irrelevance, the growing inability to put into question the present and the existing institutions, be they strictly "political" or weltanschaulich. Philosophy has had a central, if mostly in- direct, rôle in this critique. This rôle is being dissolved first 1 For my part I have dealt with the subject in "Modern Capitalism and Revolution" (1960-1961), available now in English in my Political and So- cial Writings y Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988, vol. 2, especially pp. 271-296, and in various other texts among which "The Crisis of Western Societies" is available in a (poor) English version in Telos, No. 53, Fall 1982.</page><page sequence="2">4 CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS and foremost by contemporary social-historical trends, which I will not discuss here.2 But an effect of these trends, which in turn reinforces them, is the influence of the heideggerian and post-heideggerian adoration of brute "reality", and the heideg- gerian proclamation "we have nothing to do", "nothing is to be done."3 The combination of both can be found in the glorifica- tion of a "debile thought", of a soft, weak, flexible thought ex- pressly adapted to the society of the media. Deconstructionist "criticism", carefully limiting itself to the deconstruction of old books, is one of the symptoms of the crisis. The proclamation of the "end of philosophy" is, of course, not new. It is most clearly decreed by Hegel. It rests, both in Hegel and in Heidegger, on a philosophy which is, indissociab- ly, an ontology (or a "thinking of Being"), a philosophy of his- tory and a philosophy of the history of philosophy. It is not my purpose to discuss Hegel, nor Heidegger's ontology. But some remarks do seem to me relevant here. Heidegger's implicit philosophy of history - history as Geschick, destiny, destination and donation of/by Being - and the entirety of his writing have as necessary condition Heidegger's congenital blindness before the political/critical ac- tivity of humans (at the root of his adherence to nazism and the Führerprinzip). This blindness is fittingly complemented by a seemingly equally congenital blindness concerning sexuality and, more generally, the psyche. Here we have the bizarre spectacle of a philosopher talking interminably about the Greeks, and whose thought draws a blank in the place of polis, eros, and psyche. But an "interpretation" of Greek philosophy ignoring sytematically the fact that philosophy was born in and through the polis and is a part of the same move- ment which brought about the first democracies, is bound to be 2 Cf. the texts in Note 1 and my "The Crisis of Culture and the State" (Oc- casional Papers Nr 16, Center for Humanistic Studies, University of Min- nesota, 1987). Cf. for instance and among many other formulations, the "Conversation on a Country Path" concerning Gelassenheit: "We are to do nothing, but wait." (In Discourse on Thinking, New York: Harper and Row, 1966, p. 61.) The posthumous Spiegel interview is also very outspoken on this point. Thus, Ilpensiere debole (Gianni Vatimo and P.A. Rovati ed., Milano, 1983), and Gianni Vattimo, La fine della modernità (Garzanti Editore, 1985).</page><page sequence="3">The "end of philosophy"? 5 irredeemably lame. If, as Heidegger once wrote, Greek is not "a" language, but the language, and therefore predestined for philosophy, what are we to make of the fact that Spartans spoke Greek - indeed, they spoke better than the other Greeks, lakonizein - but no Spartan philosopher is known? The same blindness leads him to see in the present period only the domination of technique and "science" - in both cases, with an unbelievably naive stance before the supposed om- nipotence of both - and makes him incapable of seeing the in- ternal crisis of the technoscientific universe and, even more important, the activities of humans directed against the present system and the possibilities these activities contain. This philosophy of history leads Heidegger to a method of interpretation of the history of philosophy which is, at its core, hegelian, for the same deep reasons and, in fact, with the same results. In short: a true critical discussion of the philosophers of the past is forbidden or becomes impossible. Thereby philosophical democracy, the intertemporal agora of living and dead philosophers where they gather over the centuries and truly discuss, is abolished. With Hegel, critique of the past philosophers is only a sign that the critic does not understand what philosophy is. Past philosophers cannot be criticized, but only surmounted, aufgehoben, shown to lead "from inside" to the next philosopher, and so on till we arrive at Absolute Knowledge, that is the hegelian system. (Of course, Hegel him- self could not possible remain faithful to this programme.) The deep links of this attitude to Hegel's overall philosophy are as obvious as the intractable impossibilities it leads to. The end of philosophy is not a whim or an opinion of Hegel - it is the necessary implication of his whole system, which stands and falls with it. Things are not truly different with Heidegger. No critical discussion of the past philosophers can take place; the "thinkers", in fact, express moments in the "History of Being", Being talks through their mouths. (Of course, Heidegger also 5 Except for the Lacedaemonian Hilon, one of the Seven Sages. Heidegger's monstrous (and, in the most important place, clearly political-reactionary) "interpretation" of the celebrated stasimon of Antigone ("many things are terrible...") at the end of his Introduction to Metaphysics shows how deep- ly alien he was to the Greek world and spirit.</page><page sequence="4">6 CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS cannot remain faithful to his programme.) Past philosophers can only be interpreted and "deconstructed11 (the programme of Sein und Zeit is die Destruktion der Ontologie; "deconstruction" is a more recent fruit). This means that it has to be shown, in each case, that they all partake of "metaphysics" understood as the covering up of the "ontological difference", the Forgetting of Being, the preoccupation with the being of beings and the neglect of the question of the Meaning of Being, and that nevertheless and curiously, this forgetting somehow "progres- ses" (that is, regresses) in a quite hegeloid fashion through his- tory, toward more and more complete forms, so that the accomplishment/achievement of metaphysics and the forget- ting of Being are there at once with Plato (and perhaps even the pre-socratics), but are more completely completed with Hegel and, then, Nietzsche. Along this way, conflicts, con- tradictions, struggle among philosophers are ignored or covered up, and the whole histoiy of philosophy is linearized so as to reach its destined result - the closure of metaphysics and its thinker, Heidegger. With Hegel, all philosophies are reduced to the same in the sense that all of them represent merely "moments" in the process of self-consciousness and self- cognizance of the Spirit - and in the sense that all these "mo- ments" stand convicted as "moments" of the (hegelian) System. With Heidegger, all philosophers are reduced to the same: they represent various but, when we come to the heart of the matter, indifferent ways of forgetting Being, of thinking Being as presence, and of mixing up presence and that which is, in each case, present. With post-heideggerians, this will become the unbreakable circle of Greek-Western onto-logo-theo-phal- locentrism. But fortunately, we are not yet completely lost. With the help of the Zeitgeist^ some noises about the possibility of evading this circle through recourse to the Old Testament (not of course the New, hopelessly contaminated by those damned Greeks), are increasingly perceptible. After we had been almost convinced of the nothingness of any "transcenden- tal signified", we are now informed that Jehovah, his laws and 6 Cf: the last pages of Der Spruch des Anaximander (1946), where Aristotle, Plato, Heraclitus, Parmenides and Anaximander are presented as think- ing "the same".</page><page sequence="5">The "end of philosophy"? 7 the ethic of the Hebrews can and must be restored in the place of a (meta- ? or post- ?) transcendental signified. Dare we hope that we only need to replace philosophy by revelation in order to be saved? * * * No wonder that, a few exceptions apart, philosophy is practiced less and less, and that most of what bears that name today is just commentary and interpretation, or rather, com- mentary squared and interpretation squared. This means also that the history of philosophy itself is becoming distorted, torn between spiritless and scholastic academicism and deconstruc- tionist irrelevance. How to approach the history of philosophy, that is, the work of important philosophers of the past, is of course a huge question in itself. Some cardinal points seem to me worth noting. A philosopher writes and publishes because he believes that he has important and true things to say - but also, be- cause he wants to be discussed. Being discussed entails also, possibly, being criticized and refuted. And all great philosophers of the past - up to and including Kant, Fichte and Schelling - have explicitly discussed, criticized and fre- quently refuted - or thought that they refuted - their predecessors. They thought, rightly, that they belonged to a transtemporal, social-historical public space, to the transhis- torical agora of reflexion, and that their public criticism of other philosophers was an essential factor in maintaining and enlarging this space as a space of freedom where there are no authorities, no revelation, no General Secretary, no Führer, and no Geschick des Seins; where different doxae are con- fronted and where everybody is entitled, at his own risks and perils, to express disagreement. This is why for a philosopher there can only be a critical history of philosophy. Critique of course presupposes the most painful and disinterested attempt to understand the work criticized. But it requires also constant vigilance as regards its possible limitations - which result from the almost inevitable</page><page sequence="6">8 CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS closure of any work of thought that accompanies its breaking of the previous closure. But this is also why for a philosopher there must be a critical history of philosophy . If this history is not critical, he is not a philosopher, just an historian, an interpreter, a her- meneutician. And if there is no history in the full meaning of the word, the philosopher works under the fatal delusion that he is starting everything all over again - the delusion of the tabula rasa. Philosophy is a reflexive activity that deploys it- self both freely and under the constraint of its own past. Philosophy is not cumulative - but it is deeply historical. In this sense, a circular situation obviously obtains, one which does not manifest any "logical defect", but expresses the very essence of self-reflexion within the necessarily total horizon of philosophical thought - or the fact that its center is its periphery, and vice versa. A critical history of the past is not possible without a proper standpoint. But it is not possible, either, without some conception of what history is - human history in the widest and deepest meaning of the term - and what the place of philosophy in this history is. (In this respect, Hegel and Heidegger are, of course, formally correct.) This does not in the least mean "explaining" (and "refuting") Plato and Aristotle by the existence of slavery, Descartes and Locke by the rise of the bourgeoisie and all the well-known similar nonsense. But it does most emphatically mean that past (and present) philosophy has to take its place in the history of the human imaginary and of the painful, millenary struggle against the heteronomous institution of society. It would be just as silly to deny the essential political motives and deter- minations of Plato's philosophy, the fight against democracy, and their deep links to the whole of Plato's thought up to and including his ontology - as it would be silly to deny that Plato created and instituted again, for a second time, philosophy and that he remains to this day the greatest philosopher of all. Equally, and on a much more modest level, it would be silly to deny the deeply reactionary, antidemocratic motives and traits of Heidegger's thought, manifest already in Sein und Zeit (six years before the Rektoratrede) and persisting to the end (the posthumous spiegel interview), and their intimate relation to</page><page sequence="7">The "end of philosophy"? 9 the whole of his conceptions - as it would be silly to deny that Heidegger was one of the important philosophers of the twen- tieth century and to assert that a philosopher today could simply ignore him. The paradox apparently involved here cer- tainly requires further elucidation, but this is not our present theme. Philosophy is not cumulative - as science could be taken to be, though even here things are not so clear as they usually appear. For practical purposes, anyhow, one can learn physics or mathematics today by studying contemporary textbooks, and with no need to read Newton, Einstein, Archimedes, Gauss or Cantor. Art is not cumulative either, though it is a different case. Immersion in the culture where a given work of art has been created is almost always a condition for "under- standing" (not only externally) works of art. But this does not mean that one cannot be taken by Wagner, say, unless one has gone through all the steps from Gregorian chant to Beethoven, etc. With philosophy it is a different matter again. As self- reflexive activity of thought, philosophy entails that, ideally, any form of thought is obligatorily relevant for it; therefore also, for a philosopher, is obligatorily relevant what other philosophers have already thought. But self-reflexivity means of course critique: a philosopher critical of past philosophers is exerting, so to speak, self-critique (rightly or wrongly is another matter). I cannot wake up one morning with an idea contradicting what I thought up to then, and rush to develop it forgetting what I was thinking in all my previous life. Birds sing innocently anew every morning - but they are birds, and they sing the same song. In the same way, I cannot ignore the fact that my own thought, however original I may deem it to be, is but a ripple, at best a wave, in the huge social-historical stream which welled up in Ionia twenty-five centuries ago. I am under the double imperative: to think freely, and to think under the constraint of history. Far from forming a double bind, this apparent and real antinomy is a spring and a source of strength for philosophical thought. Putting it in the simplest, plainest way: the spring and the strength of a poten- tially immensely rich monological dialogue.</page><page sequence="8">10 CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS This means also, finally, that I must have - or gradually form - a conception of what philosophy is, of what self- reflexive activity is about. Now, what philosophy is has been each time defined again, explicitly or implicitly, by every im- portant philosopher - and each time in the most intimate relation with the content of his philosophy. (No need to quote examples of this.) In other words, it is impossible to define what philosophy is without some understanding of what philosophers have said - this is almost a tautology - , but also, without a critical stand (which may lead to just a reconfir- mation) in regard to it. Thus the conception of philosophy I form is strongly linked with the conception of the history of philosophy I form, and vice versa. But it is also impossible to think what philosophy is, without some conception of history, since philosophy is a social-historical datum. (Whatever the "Transcendental" claims, I would stop discussion with some- body asserting that Aristotle could have been Chinese or Hegel Italian.) And, to close the circle, this shows that a philosophy is impossible without a philosophy of the social-historical. * * * In this respect, I can only summarize here, dogmatically, my own positions. I believe it impossible to understand what philosophy is truly, without taking into account its central place in the birth and deployment of the social-historical project of autonomy (individual and social). Philosophy and democracy were born at the same time and in the same place. Their solidarity comes from the fact that both express the refusal of heteronomy - the rejection of the claims to validity and legitimacy of rules and representations just because they happen to be there, the refusal of any external authority (even, and especially, "divine"), of any extrasocial source of truth and justice, in brief, the putting into question of existing institu- tions and the assertion of the capacity of the collectivity and of thought to institute themselves explicitly and reflexively.7 To 7 Cf. my text "The Greek polis and the creation of democracy", in the Graduate Faculty Philosophy Journal, New School for Social Research, New York, Vol. 9, No. 2, Fall 1983.</page><page sequence="9">The "end of philosophy"? 1 1 put it in another way: the struggle for democracy is the strug- gle for true self-government. As the aim of self-government does not accept any external limits, true self-government en- tails explicit self-institution, which presupposes of course the putting into question of the existing institution - and this, in principle, at any time. The project of collective autonomy means that the collectivity, which can only exist as instituted, recognizes and recovers its instituting character explicitly, and questions itself and its own activities. In other words, democracy is the regime of (political) self-reflexivity. What laws ought we to have, and for what reasons? But the same is true about philosophy. Philosophy is not about the question: what is Being, or what is the meaning of Being, or why is there something rather than nothing, etc. All these questions are secondary, in the sense that they are all conditioned upon the emergence of a more radical question (radically impossible in a heteronomous society): what is it that I ought to think (about being, about physis, about the polis, about justice, etc. - and about my own thinking)? This questioning goes on, and has to go on, incessantly, for a simple reason. Any being-for-itself exists and can only exist in a closure. Thus also society and the social individual. Democracy is the project of breaking the closure at the collec- tive level. Philosophy, creating self-reflective subjectivity, is the project of breaking the closure at the level of thought. But of course, any breaking of the closure, unless it remains a gaping "?" which does not break anything at all, posits some- thing, reaches some results, and, thereby, risks erecting again a closure. The continuation and renewal of reflexive activity - not for the sake of "renewal", but because this is self-reflexive activity - entails therefore the putting into question of pre- vious results (not necessarily their rejection - no more so than the revisability of laws in a democracy entails that they have to be changed wholesale every morning). Thus, the birth of philosophy is not just coincident, but equi-significant with the birth of democracy. Both are expres- sions, and central embodiments, of the project of autonomy. Here one has to take up another aspect of the deformation Greece underwent and is constantly undergoing at the hands</page><page sequence="10">12 CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS of the never fully de-christianised Westerners. Greek political creation - the polis and democracy - has always been seen as a static "result", and "merits" and "demerits" of the Athenian democracy discussed as if this regime were to be a model or an anti-model for ever and anywhere8 - instead of being seen to show that what is really democratic in Athens over and above all the rest, and what is of paramount importance for us, is not any particular institution established at a certain point in time (though many of them are full of lessons for us), but the con- tinuous process of democratic self-institution, going on for al- most three centuries: there is the creativity, there is the self-reflexivity, there is democracy and there is the lesson. In the same way, the important thing about Greek philosophy - over and above any "results" reached (we all know how weighty these remain) - is the continuing process of its self-institu- tion. As soon as Thaïes appears, he conditions the appearance of another philosopher, and so on; a self-reflexive movement of thought starts in a truly historical dimension, embodied also in continuous open and public discussion and critique; and this is not a vain assertion of "individuality," since these thinkers con- tinuously take cognizance of each other's positions and produce arguments (almost all of them still to be taken into account today), materializing thereby not a "dialectical progression", but a genuine historical self-deployment of thought. Not two or three "schools", frozen for ever and commenting interminably on the teachings of Confucius or Lao-Tzu, but many dozens of truly independent thinkers. The pythagorians excepted, "schools" come into existence only when decadence sets in: with Plato and afterwards. With the fall of democracy and the stoics, philosophy becomes rigidified in schools and given more and more to commentary and interpretation. We can date the end of this period as synchronous with the end of the period of democratic political creation. 404 - the defeat of the Athenians in the Peloponnesian war - and 399 What is worse: most of the time, Western political philosophers - e.g.: Leo Strauss - usually talk about the "political thought of the Greeks", hereby meaning mostly Plato (and much less Aristotle) This is tantamount to speaking about the "political thinking of the French Revolution" quoting Joseph de Maistre or Charles Maurras.</page><page sequence="11">The "end of philosophy"? 13 - the death sentence against Socrates , - are symbolically of equal importance. Socrates is the last philosopher citizen - and the demos of the Athenians is no more the demos of the fifth and sixth centuries. It may seem as a paradox that the decadent period then starting produced two of the greatest philosophers ever, Plato and Aristotle - though the matricide Plato was brought up and formed under democracy. With Plato starts the platonic torsion which has dominated, ever since, the history of philosophy - or at least, its mainstream. The philosopher ceases to be a citizen. He gets out of - or above - the polis, and tells people what to do, deriving it from his own epistémé. He searches, and thinks he reaches, a unitary ontology - that is, a theological ontology. At the cen- ter of this ontology, as of all the rest, he places the meta-idea of determinaçy (peras, Bestimmtheit). He tries to derive from on- tology the ideal polity. And later (with the stoics and much more so, with christianism), he sanctities reality, i.e. he starts rationalizing that which exists in all fields. We do not need to dwell upon the long intermediary period. A new birth takes place in Western Europe around the late twelfth and early thirteenth century, with the emergence of the protobourgeoisie and the constitution of political collec- tivities - the new or renewed cities - attempting self-govern- ment. From then on, philosophy, though under heavy christ ian-theological constraints, again becomes involved with the Western emancipatory movement, but it never frees itself fully, in its dominant stream, from the main traits of the platonic torsion. From the sixteenth century onwards, the struggle becomes manifest within philosophy itself. Thus, the evolving galaxy of European philosophy, from Occam and Duns Scotus to Husserl and Heidegger, always presents antinomic characteristics. It is sometimes a participant in the eman- cipatory struggles, more frequently indifferent toward them or their scornful enemy. The system-building, reality-sacralizing, looking-down-upon the collectivity attitude remains, in various guises, the predominant one, with, sometimes, the most paradoxical outcomes: e.g. the "critical" thinkers Marx and Nietzsche clearly belong in the sancta realitas mentality (laws of history, "innocence of becoming," etc.). The main contribu-</page><page sequence="12">14 CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS tion of philosophy to the emancipatory movement during this whole period is to be found not so much in its "contents", but in its maintaining an open debate and a critical spirit. Though denying it in principle most of the time, it re-instaurates de facto the philosophical agora. * * * The traits I outlined above as characteristic of the platonic (plus stoic-christian) torsion are evident (except for the idea of determinacy) in Heidegger and underlie his proclamation of the "end of philosophy". The sancta realitas principle is central with him. Planetary domination by techno- science is taken as unsurmountable not by virtue of a reflexion on the social-historical possibilities and forces (such a reflexion could not, anyhow, reach a categorical result nor decide the case) but on the basis of strictly "metaphysical" (in the derogatory sense) and fully arbitrary pronouncements about the "destiny of Being". This is consonant, and combined, with the most uncritical and in fact uninformed view about contem- porary technique and science. The "theoretical" ground for the proclamation of the "end of philosophy," briefly speaking, that philosophy is "metaphysics" and that metaphysics has been restlos ("ab- 9 Heidegger writes in the Introduction to Being and Time as if science were on the eve of discovering the single full ultimate equation of the universe, with a hint that this is what Werner Heisenberg ivas working at. It is highly improbable that Werner Heisenberg could have thought such a nonsense (he was one of the last great physicists with a knowledge of and feeling for philosophy); at most, he might have been talking about hopes for one or another type of "unified field theory", and it is much more prob- able that Heidegger understood what he could and wanted to understand. But had Heisenberg actually said that, a philosopher ought to have reacted with a sorrowful smile, both on grounds of principle and because he ought to know that, from Newton through Lord Kelvin through George Gamow and up to today's proponents of TOE (theory of everything), physicists have periodically proclaimed the advent of the theory to end all theories - and each time, journalists have been, of course, quick to spread the good tidings. Heidegger in fact believes naively in modern science and technique the way a bank teller amateur reader of vulgarized "scientific" magazines believes in it. He never saw the deep internal antinomies and aporias contemporary science is full of.</page><page sequence="13">The "end of philosophy"? 15 sorbed") by contemporary science, only makes sense on the basis of Heidegger's thesis that there can be a Denken des Seins or a Denken des Sinnes von Sein as such, separated from any reflexion concerning Seiendes or das Sein des Seienden. The thesis is both sterile and meaningless. Its sterility is im- mediately apparent in the fact that, with Heidegger himself, it has only led to pseudopoetic and pseudoprophetic high-sound- ing words (like das Gevier, etc.), and that nowhere can one see, even approximately, what the Denken des Seins consists in. No wonder that Heidegger's epigones proved unable to produce anything along this direction, and had to confine themselves to the endless "interpretation" and "deconstruction" of past philosophers. But the thesis could make sense only on the faulty presupposition that the object of philosophy would be, for in- stance, the question of Being, or why is there something rather than nothing, etc. In fact, as I said before, the object of philosophy is the question: what ought I, what ought we, to think - about being, about knowledge of Being, about "I", about "we," about our polity, about justice,etc. And one obvious result of the heideggerian restriction is that any reflexion on politics or ethics, for instance, becomes impossible, both on grounds of "substance", because "we are to do nothing but wait" (Gelassenheit) - this being of course the immediate con- sequence of the conception of history as "destination of Being" - and on grounds of "method", since, e.g. the polis and all that must be taken as belonging to the "ontic" therefore do not form a worthy object of the thought of Being. How wonderfully all this fits die geistige und politische Situation der Zeit, the spiritual and political situation of the times, hardly needs saying. This of course does not forbid anybody from discussing its substance. But neither can one fail to see that these proclamations appear at a time when the questions: what are we to think? what are we to do? are taking on a tragic immediacy and urgency. In this sense, the heideg- gerian philosophy and its offshoots are but one of the expres- sions of (and a minor factor in) the more general trend toward the decomposition of the Western society and culture - that is, toward the vanishing of the project of autonomy. But this</page><page sequence="14">16 CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS trend, undoubtedly real and more and more threatening (we have not waited for Heidegger to see and say that), nobody can today consider as definitively and irreversibly victorious. We do not yet live in fifth century Rome or Constantinople. * * * There is, in fact, no real possibility that philosophy be- comes absorbed by techno-science. What is possible, and in- deed taking place, is that genuine philosophical questions get buried deeper and deeper under a thick layer of a quiet and soft dogmatism of positivistic metaphysics (in secret complicity with an "anarchism/scepticism" à la Feyerabend: "anything goes" is a thoroughly positivistic position. Anything goes and nothing goes really, but some things work provisionally; the 10 Sometimes, nice, sincere and honest people say: but you cannot deny that Heidegger is the critique of modern technique. This is of course "epochal" parochialism and ignorance. The critique of modern technique starts at least with Rousseau and the romantics, is there through the whole of the nineteenth century (e.g. William Morris, Ruskin, etc.) and becomes the lieu commun in Germany around the turn of the century with Max Weber, Tönnies, A. Weber, Simmel, etc. The Chapter "The Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat" in History and Class-Consciousness of G. Lukàcs (1923), developing ideas of Marx and of Weber, contains, of course in a marxist garb, most of what is of some substance, in this respect, in Sein und Zeit (1927) and the Einführung in die Metaphysik (1935). The Frankfurt School should also be mentioned in this respect. (Nobody seems to have noted that most of Foucault's writing is but an application of the central ideas of Lukàcs and the Frankfurt School in some particular fields.) In brief: the critique of modern technique and its world, of reified society, the Entzauberung der Welt, etc. was at large in Weimar Germany (and in other European countries: cf., e.g., D.H. Lawrence) and belonged to both the "right wing" and the "left wing" of opponents of capitalist society. What Heidegger "added" to it was to make technique the result of "Western metaphysics", instead of seeing that (a) the birth of capitalism and the work of Descartes/Leibniz, say, were parallel manifestations of a new social-historical imaginary (neither Plotinus', nor Thomas Aquinas' metaphysics "produed " technique or capitalism); and (b) parallely, and an- tinomically, the project of autonomy (the emancipatory or democratic movement) never ceased to manifest itself and to interfere - in an ex- tremely complex relation of antagonism and mutual contamination - with the capitalistic project of unlimited expansion of pseudorational pseudomastery. But of course for Heidegger the democratic movement could be nothing more than another expression of the modern Forgetting of Being.</page><page sequence="15">The "end of philosophy"? 17 question of truth is a "metaphysical" question, etc.), whilst, in other buildings of the Academia, historians of philosophy go on chewing the dried fruits of their specialty, and, in the glorious free market of ideas, "philosophical" punk sects supply ideoclips for the consumption of the various media. I must leave aside here the question whether, in the present social-historical situation, a single person recognizing what I take to be the genuine tasks of philosophy and working on them can do more than bring forward a personal oeuvre. What the resonance of such an oeuvre may be, what stimulus it could provide for a renewal of philosophical activity, these are of course questions which can never be answered in advance. In this respect as in other domains, the only valid maxim is: fais ce que dois} advienne que pourra. But one example will help, I hope, to understand why I consider impossible - de jure - the "disappearance of philosophy within the world of technicized science." Virtually the whole of inherited philosophy, when talking about the world or physical (and psychical) being, has in view either the Lebenswelt (most ancient philosophers, partly Kant, fully of course the later Husserl and Heidegger), or the "classi- cal" world of mathematical physics (from Descartes onwards). In both cases these images have played a decisive role both as paradigms of "being" (Seiendes) and as the basis for a method. Now, the Lebenswelt (that is, the return of old Husserl to Aristotle's starting point) is an indispensable common initial ground - but slippery and full of holes and quicksands. And the "classical" edifice lies in ruins. Things, time, space, matter have become riddles more than they ever have been. Modern physics, generally without knowing it, is uneasily sitting simultaneously on all four pairs of the kantian antinomies - and adds to them plenty of new ones. Its wonderful instrument, mathematics, displays more and more its terrifying efficiency - for no apparent reason (the kantian reasons are of no avail for a quasi-riemannian four- or perhaps ten-dimensional manifold). The dazzlingly rapid progression of mathematics, whilst unveiling the gap in its own foundations (undecidability theorems - Godei, Turing, Church) and based on paradoxical assumptions (axiom of</page><page sequence="16">18 CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS choice) has led to a situation (Godei and Paul Cohen on the continuum hypothesis) where an indefinite number of "non- euclidian11 ("non-cantorian") set theories appear possible. Mathematics appears more and more as a free creation of human imagination working under certain constraints (consis- tency, economy). But it also appears as (a) strangely related to the physical world (any physical theory is mathematized, though sometimes in a very weird way, e.g. quantum theory, and purely mathematical considerations play a tremendous heuristic role in today's physics), and (b) bumping against no man-made constraints, necessities and intrinsic kinships. We seem to be creating a multilayered "ideal" world which, in the most strange and uninspectable way, encounters both a multi- layered physical world and an "ideal" world in itself. Everybody knows, or ought to know, the chaotic theoreti- cal situation in fundamental physics - a situation that is all the more puzzling, as it does not in the least interfere with the experimental, observational and practical accuracy and ef- ficiency of physics, nor with its predictive capacity. The two main theories - general relativity and quanta - are, both, continuously corroborated by observation and experiment, while each of them contains as yet unsolved deep problems and while they contradict each other. The classical edifice of categories - by no means causality alone - is a broken machine that still turns out wonderful products. And I could go on for pages. It would be silly to speak of all this as just "epistemologi- cal" or even "metaphysical" (in the heideggerian sense) problems. They go directly at the heart of the ontological ques- tion. What is the being of this being (humans), that can freely create forms, which then turn out to have something to do with, and encounter, something externally given? What is the being of these forms? And what is the being of the externally given? But then: what ought we to think of being as such, if being belongs also to a being capable of a free creation which both meets and fails to meet whatever there is? It would be ridiculous to think that these questions are eliminated by the"ontological difference" - or by the supremacy of the ques- tion about "the meaning of Being". The question of the "mean-</page><page sequence="17">The "end of philosophy"? 19 ing of Being" in the resolutely un- and anti-aristotelian turn Heidegger wants to imprint on it is meaningless, except as an anthropomorphic/anthropological and/or theological question. Who told you that there is a meaning of Being? And the "on- tological difference" is just a terminological nicety, without substantive import. Being is inseparable from the modes of being, themselves in turn inseparable from beings. To put it in the fashionable jargon: presence as such is obviously different from that which is present - but presence itself is each time different, is in a different mode in relation to that which presents itself. The presence of a lover is not the presence of a crocodile (not necessarily, at any rate). The phenomenality of the phenomena is not itself a phenomenal datum, to be sure. But the phenomenality of ,e.g. thought, is not the phenomenality of a star. To talk just about phenomenality (or presence, or presence/absence, etc.) becomes of necessity empty talk (logikon hai kenon, Aristotle would say), meaning simply: something is given - es gibt - something has to be given. Far from absorbing philosophy, in the sense of integrating the philosophical questions within its methods and its procedures, contemporary science both returns to these and puts them into a new light. Something is given - something has to be given - but to whom, and how? Are mathematics "given" to us - or are we creating mathematics? In what place are infinite-dimensional hilbertian spaces "given"? And who is thinking of Being? Is it the Dasein - this bastard and composite construct (bastard and composite as is the philosophical "subject" almost always), ignorant of its constituent elements, an artificial juxtaposition of psychical, social-historical and reflexive components pep- pered with a powder strongly smelling both of the social-his- torical situation of the time and of its creators' idiosyncrasies and value choices? If we are doing philosophy (or even, "thinking the mean- ing of Being"), we have to ask: who is that "we", and what is he or she? Who and what am I, when I stop being simply a Dasein and start reflecting on the question: who and what am I qua Dasein? Now the latest era has witnessed the flourishing of an eclectic, incongruous and unthoughtful hodgepodge, proclaim-</page><page sequence="18">20 CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS ing "the death of the subject" (and of man, of meaning, of his- tory, etc.), under the sign of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud, but - strongly - with Heidegger as the philosophical guarantor. But one could not note, in all this, the slightest awareness of the true questions raised, on the philosophical level, by psychoanalysis or by whatever is of value in Marx or Nietzsche. I leave aside the obvious objection of the clever high-school adolescent: if everything you say is determined by your unconscious (or your social position), or is just an inter- pretation, then so too is this very conception of yours (this was already well-known in Athens around 450 B.C.). But the sub- stantive problem is: given that it is true that at the core of the "subject" (whatever that may mean) an unconscious psyche most of the time motivates its acts (therefore, also, its pronouncements); given that it is true that nobody can ever jump over his times or extract himself from the society where he belongs; given that it is true that any statement contains an irredeemable element of interpretation corresponding to the interpreter's position, outlook and interests - how can it be that we are capable of a self-reflexive activity, including the one leading us to the above statements and all the others? In the face of this situation - which, by the way, is not fundamentally new in its form (but I will not dwell on that now) - and barring a self-silencing radical skepticism, only two positions seem possible. Either we accept that this or that individual or philosopher - for instance, Heidegger, or stultiores minoresque alii - has been endowed, for no reason, with the capacity to utter the truth - or the meta-, or the post-truth - , anyhow: to make pronouncements valid for everybody, but about which no further enquiry is possible. Then we revert simply to the consecration of a particular philosopher as a prophet - that is, we revert to the religious position. Or we stand in the Greek-Western tradition, and recog- nize no prophets - whether it be God or Being talking through their respective mouths. Then we remain under the obligation of logon didonai - of giving account and reason for whatever we say and do publicly. Logon didonai does not mean, of course, mathematical demonstration or experimental cor-</page><page sequence="19">The "end of philosophy"? 21 roboration, neither does it mean the search for and the exhibi- tion of a "foundation". But it means that we accept critique and discussion; and discussion is not possible without the require- ment of a minimal consistency (which is not ensemblist-iden- titary consistency). Then we have to face this challenge: how is it that a physical being, which is at the same time social-historical, can become a reflexive subjectivity? For various reasons, the kan- tian position will not do. We cannot be satisfied with the "transcendental" point of view - or, in other terms, with the simple distinction between the quaestio juris and the quaestio facti - because the "subject" we are interested in - and which is of critical importance for whatever we think and do - is not a "Transcendental" subject. We find ourselves facing two, prima facie antinomical, considerations: we know, and cannot pretend to forget, that for whatever we do and think, there are psychical and social-historical conditions (not "causes"!); and we cannot pretend to ignore that we attempt to think, to dis- cuss and to judge irrespective of these conditions, that we in- tend validity for what we say irrespective of place, moment, motives and conditions. We therefore have to recognize both the effective and the reflexive point of view. And we have to face the fact that it is only in and through the social-historical (and leaning on certain capacities of the psyche) that the reflexive (of which the "transcendental" is a dimension) be- comes effective. If we cannot think the possibility and the effec- tivity of a marriage between jus and factum, we simply cannot think anymore. But we know that reflexive thinking, no more than As is, or ought to be, known, Kant wavers on this point. He continually speaks of "us humans", and of the interest of our reason - and constructs a "transcendental subject" of which we never know if it represents the way we actually function or the way we ought to function. In brief: the "transcendental" answer leaves us in the dark as to the ontological status of the knowing subject.

It emerges, it is created through human activity at a certain time in a certain place (after which, of course, it becomes virtually accessible to all humans). We therefore have to recognize in them human crea- tions; we are thus led to recognize also, beyond that, the other- wise obvious fact that human history is creation - of significations and institutions embodying them, of the social individual out of the "raw material11 of the psyche, and of self- reflexive subjectivity. We then can see - from the vantage point of a tradition to which philosophy and democracy belong - that almost all societies have instituted themselves as heteronomous, in and through the closure of their institutions and significations. Then we see that democracy and philosophy are the twin expressions of a social-historical rupture, creating the project of (social and individual) autonomy. The meaning of this project is the refusal of closure, and the establishment of another relationship between the instituting and the instituted at the collective level, between radical imagination and the so- cialized individual at the level of the singular human being, be- tween the incessant reflexive activity of thought and its results and accomplishments at any given moment. These are creations. There is no way of showing that the condensation of galaxies, the Big Bang or the combinatory properties of carbon were necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of democracy and philosophy. On the one hand, this leads us again into the ontological issue: there is at least a type of being capable of altering its mode of being - and since this is a mode of being »therefore it pertains to what we think of Being. On the other hand, this creation contains the creation of a social-historical space where, and of a type of individual - self-reflexive subjectivity - for whom, the ques- tion of truth can arise and be elucidated in a nonvacuous fashion. That means that the reflexive belongs to the effective - and that the effective can bear the reflexive. This has noth- ing to do with a Geschick des Seins, a destination/donation of Being. The creation of the project of autonomy, the reflexive ac- tivity of thought and the struggle for the creation of self- reflexive i.e. democratic institutions, are the results and the manifestations of the making/doing of humans. It is human ac-</page><page sequence="21">The "end of philosophy"? 23 tivity that gave birth to the claim for a truth each time break- ing the walls of the instituted representations of the tribe. It is human activity which created the claim for freedom, equality, justice, in its struggle against established institutions. And it is our free and historical recognition of the validity of this project, and the effectivity of its partial realization up to now, that binds us to these claims - claim for truth, claim for freedom, equality and justice - and which motivates us to move forward in this direction. To work under these claims is therefore both a political and a philosophical task, in all senses of these terms. From the more specifically philosophical point of view, the closure we are up against is the ensemblist-identitaiy character which has more and more, since the stoics, dominated philosophy. At this level, the idea of an "end of philosophy" expresses essentially the impotence to overcome the ensemblist-identitaiy closure, and the vain attempt to escape from it by taking refuge in pseudo-poetical and pseudo-prophetical utterances masquerading as thought.
