<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GENESIS OF SAFAWID RELIGIOUS PAINTING By J. M. Rogers* The existence of religious wall paintings dating from the late Safawid period has been known to historians for some considerable time and, indeed, formed the subject of a paper read to the Third International Congress of Iranian Art and Archaeology at Leningrad in 1935,1 when the question of its origins was also opened. Our knowledge of the monuments, notably the Imamzdda Shah Zayd at Isfahan and a second Im~mzada at Amul has unfortunately increased little in the thirty years or so since this first report, and it is far from clear how many more of these wall paintings remain to be discovered. Whatever the state of affairs, the fundamental question of the style and content of the paintings must await a complete survey of the extant monuments, as well as more detailed publication of those already known.2 The purpose of the present study is, therefore, severely circumscribed: questions of iconography are of necessity rather neglected, and the main emphasis is upon the intel- lectual process by which such an exceptional genre of painting for Muslim society apparently came to be accepted by the orthodox. The pictorial sources upon which it drew are still mysterious, but it is, meanwhile, possible to throw light upon the reasons why in the late Safawid period there seems to have been a breakdown of the traditional Muslim prejudices, Shi'i as much as Sunni, which, it is still customary to believe, so much inflamed the Muslim 'ulamd' at every period against painting in a religious context. The argument falls into three parts, firstly, a discussion of the nature of religious painting in general; secondly, an examination, in rather more detail than has previously been attempted, of a number of literary sources for the existence of religious painting in Islam in the pre-Safawid period; and, finally, an attempt to suggest that the development of the religious paintings of Safawid Persia finds its origins in the culture of Iran and Transoxania of the fourteenth-fifteenth centuries, which are characterized by a striking growth of mystical or devotional literature and which, on some occasions, is accompanied by manuscript painting which, itself, has a fair title to be called " religious ". It should, however, be clearly stated initially that the problem which is under discussion is not one which may readily be answered by reference to current Shi'i practice in Iran or Iraq. Sociological or anthropological investigation, while doubtless interesting in what it may reveal of what the orthodox Shi'i now believes to have been the case, will only mislead us if we allow it to do duty for an historical enquiry. More precisely, it may well be the case that Diba3 is correct in describing the pictures of 'Ali which now appear in many public places in Iran as icons, in something approaching the liturgical sense of the term; but it would be grossly improper to assume from this without careful investigation that when these paintings first appeared they played a r61le analogous to icons of the period (or of any other period) in Byzantine society. Moreover, it is widely believed, even by most orthodox Muslims at the * The present article is a revised version of a communication originally delivered to the Fifth International Congress of Iranian Art and Archaeology, Tehran, April 1968.

To proceed, however, with the question of what is to count as Muslim religious painting. Arnold's Painting in Islam5 takes it for granted that this is simply a matter of picturing prophets, saints or any scene related to some episode in the Qur'dn. It is, of course, undeniable that many scenes first described in the Qur'an have been illustrated at some time or another, notably, the story of Joseph (Silra XII which, exceptionally, is entirely narrative), Solomon, his jinns and the Queen of Sheba (Siira XXVI, verses 16-44), and a number of episodes from the Exodus in which Moses plays a central part (Stiras VII, XX and XXVI). It is also true that many scenes are illustrated with great fidelity to the details given in the Qur'dn, for example, the incident where Zulaykhd, inflamed with love for Joseph, pursues him and rips the shirt from his back (Saira XII, verses 25 ff.). But against this pictorial tradition, there is the equally undeniable fact that there has been at all periods a fundamental prejudice in Islam against illustrating the Qur'dn itself. What, then is the status of these paintings ? The answer appears to lie in the fact that they were held to illustrate not the Qur'an itself but rather the secular romances roughly based upon it, like Firdawsi's Yiasufu Zulaykhd and the many other versions which followed it, or historical works and panegyrics, like Rashid al-Din's Jdmi' al-tawdrikh and al-Birfini's al-Athdr al- bdqiya, which were not held to contain religious paintings at all. The point is, I think, clear from the Il-Khanid illustrations to the latter two manuscripts, where, although illustrations of scenes from the Qur'an and from the lives of Muhammad and other Prophets are frequent, they have no devotional purpose and are, rather, intended to emphasize the historical connection of the il-Khans with the earlier Islamic dynasties and, by fitting them into the general development of history as seen in the Qur'an, to minimize the strangeness and lack of antecedents of the r6gime and, as it were, legitimize it. In the case of the secular romances it is rather more difficult to say. Even supposing that Firdawsi's original purpose in writing a poem on the subject of Joseph may have been secular entertainment rather than religious instruction, the ability of subsequent Sfifi commentators to find allegory in almost anything makes it now very difficult to judge on internal evidence alone whether subsequent romances on this theme were secular or religious in intention. However, if we may judge by the illustrations to these later romances, it is perfectly clear that for the most part the painters envisaged their task as the entertaining illustration of a story which was in their eyes itself primarily conceived as an entertainment. It follows, therefore, that Arnold's definition of religious painting is inadequate, and that whether painting is religious or not depends not upon the subjects chosen, nor the expression of religious feeling, nor even upon the feelings which inspire the painter at this work, but upon its function. The relevant functions which religious painting may fulfil are various-the explanation of a text, the teaching of a lesson, allegorical, spiritual or moral, and perhaps (though probably only as a by-product of the foregoing) the inculcation of reverence towards revealed religion in the beholder. This will be clear from consideration of any work of the Italian Renaissance which pretends to the title of religious art. But, in contrast, none of the illustrations of the works referred to above seems to have had these functions. They do not explain the Persian text and are, for various reasons, incomprehensible without it, so that they cannot be said to teach any lesson which the text itself does not teach. Is this true of Islamic painting as a whole ? It is certainly true that it would not be profitable to illustrate the Qur'in. It follows from Islam's denial of the Incarnation that Christ, like the other Prophets, was never more than a man, a good man, doubtless, but still far from embodying in Himself the absolute prescriptions of divine law contained in the Qur'in. Hence in contrast to Christianity where the central conception of Christ as God sanctifies the practice and teaching of religion through His example as a man, in Islam the notion that one may best acquire sanctity by imitating the Prophets and the saints is necessarily secondary. By virtue of the * For example, al-Nawawi (al-Minhiaj fi sharh Muslim b. al-Hfajjdj [Cairo 1304-05], VIII, p. 398), whose general exposition as late as the thirteenth century, is one of the first Muslim attempts to consider the various pronouncements of the 'ulama' on the subject as a whole up to the time when he wrote, and who is unable to resolve the clear contradictions which the hadith contain. 5 Oxford 1928, pp. 90- 16.</page><page sequence="3">THE GENESIS OF SAFAWID RELIGIOUS PAINTING 127 Incarnation the New Testament is both the chronicle of the acts of the man, Christ, and the revelation of God to His faithful, the Old Testament being envisaged as the foreshadowing of this, to the extent that the Prophets and Kings of the Jews are seen as types of Christ. This is, indeed, the basis of the argument used by the Church Fathers to justify the illustration of Holy Writ, since the life of Christ in pictures could be seen as a convenient way of demonstrating to those who could not read the moral and spiritual lessons which they had to take to heart. The narrative episodes of the Qur'dn, however, do not ever seem to have been intended to form the connected narrative of God's revelation of Himself to man, and in general seem to take second place to the rules which normally fill out the Stiras in which they occur; indeed, the relationship of narrative episodes to legislation is often unclear and may on some occasions not even be illustrative. And M uhammad, unlike Christ, was never seen as more than a man so that, originally at least, his life was not viewed by the faithful as having essential didactic importance; the concern of exegetes was rather to discourage the orthodox from polytheism by emphasizing the complete difference between the reverence or respect due to him as a Prophet, or as the greatest of the Prophets, and the worship due to God alone. In the light of these considerations we may come to recognize the impossibility, rather than the impermissibility, of illustrating the Qur'an. The narrative elements form only a part of God's revelation, and the life of Muhammad is irrelevant to them in a doctrinal sense; and as for illustrating the legislative elements, as well illustrate the Code Napoldon. The clear impossibility, therefore, of usefully illustrating the Qur'dn-which must have been well understood in the early centuries of Islam-may ultimately in the late eighth-ninth centuries have come to be rather misunderstood as a prohibition against doing so. But there is, of course, little point in prohibiting what cannot adequately be done anyway. This somewhat arid conclusion did not find much sympathy in Iran, where the status of 'Ali, if difficult to define in terms of Christian theology, has traditionally been higher than that accorded to Muhammad by the early Sunni theologians, even to the point of his being considered the perfect man. Furthermore, the early development of Sfifi mysticism in Iran laid stress on personal sanctification rather than a rigid legalism. Also, in regard to the sixteenth-seventeenth centuries, with which we are here concerned, it is clearly the case with Safawid religious painting that it satisfies some of the condi- tions for religious art which were established above, in that it aims to encourage the faithful to emulate both the spirit of devotion even unto death of the early Shi'i martyrs and the reverence for them of their teachers. The figures are splendid, even if not always well painted, and their faces are veiled, with a nimbus where appropriate. The function which these late-Safawid paintings fulfil is, however, so far from being new to the spirit of Shi'ism that the chief grounds for surprise at its appearance in Persia at this time should be that it appears only in the handful of monuments which we know so far and at such a late date. In concluding I shall attempt to sketch out its relation to earlier developments in Muslim painting; but it is perhaps as well to admit at this point that the question of its excessively late appear- ance in Iran is one which it seems at the moment impossible to answer fully. Although the monuments are deficient there are, however, various literary testimonials to the existence of painting in Islam which might properly be described as religious. Although they are, I think, conclusive proof that the Safawid wall paintings known to us cannot have been the earliest examples of the genre, they are, nevertheless, rather difficult to evaluate. For one thing, there are so few of them. We are almost entirely dependent upon the reports of observant Western travellers, but many of these, for example Chardin (who actually devotes a whole chapter of his Voyages6 to the state of painting in Persia and yet does not mention the wall paintings of the Imimzida Shah Zayd at Isfah7n, which he almost certainly saw), utterly fail to mention them. Yet again, it is difficult to know exactly 6 Voyages du Chevalier de Chardin, ed. Langlhs (Paris 18I11), V, especially pp. 202-03, where he actually states that painting is forbidden to the extent that the Shi'i 'ulamd' will not tolerate portraits of human beings or even pictures of animals. But since he adduces this fact as an explanation not of the fact that there is no such painting in Persia but of the badness of what there is (at least, in his view), he cannot be regarded as con- clusive proof either way. SFor Chardin's visit to Isfahdn see Y. Godard, " L'Imamzade Zayd d'Isfahan: Un Edifice decor6 de Peintures religieuses Musulmanes ", Athar-e' Iran, II, part 2 (Paris I937), pp. 341-8.</page><page sequence="4">128 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES what to make of this lacuna: it certainly cannot be taken as proof of the non-existence of the genre, and factors like the widespread Shi'i unwillingness to allow non-Muslims into their shrines could perfectly well explain the absence of references by so many Western travellers to any paintings which they might have contained. Even so, it is still surprising that they do not mention rumours of them. The second difficulty arising from the sources is that they are very far from proving the existence of the same phenomenon. This is perhaps less serious than it at first appears, since it may merely reflect what we might conclude from the paucity of the extant monuments, namely the largely unformulated and probably unofficial character of religious art in the pre-Safawid period. Ibn Battilta will, therefore, be admissible for his account of the " picture of the Prophet 'Ali " which he saw in the Crimea; Don Juan of Persia for his information that by the end of the sixteenth century there was an established tradition of funerary portraiture of Shi'i martyrs (shuhadd') in some Persian mosques; and the Qa?di Ahmad for his romantic attribution of all sorts of (figural) paintings to the tomb of Bihzdd (and, as we shall see, the description is important whether it was true or not). Ibn Battflta, who in the course of one of his journeys arrived at Kerch on the northern shores of the Black Sea, recounts a very curious discovery: " I saw a church (kinisa) so we made towards it. In it I found a monk (rdhib) and on one of the walls of the church (ft ahad haytdn al-kinisa-inside, I think) I saw the figure (lra) of an Arab man wearing a turban, girt with a sword and carrying a spear in his hand (firat rajul 'arabi 'alayhi 'imdma mutaqallid sayfan), and in front of him was a lamp which was alight. I said to the monk 'What is this figure ? ' and when he replied 'This is the figure of the Prophet 'Ali ' I was filled with astonishment. .. ."8 Nevertheless, he goes on to say, they spent the night there and even tried to cook some chickens which, unfortunately, had gone bad on the voyage. There is, of course, no need to emphasize the extraordinary nature of this report, though the grounds of Ibn Battita's astonishment are not entirely clear. He is, however, in general a very careful reporter of what he sees. Thus he tries to find Muslim equivalents for non-Islamic institutions (in describing Mosul, for example, he remarks that the mdnistir of the Greeks or Christians (rmi?yyin) corresponds to the Muslim zdwaya), and he frequently gives the spelling of words which might be strange to his public. We must bear this rather schoolmasterish approach in mind when we consider the accuracy of his account. First of all, kinisa. Ibn Battfta is especially precise about the words he uses for places of worship--jdmi' and masjid for Muslims, zdwiuya for the Dervish monasteries where he usually lodged, and dayr for most of the Christian monasteries; the word, ribdt, with very few exceptions, being used for caravansarays.9 As his account suggests, the building must have been visible for some distance, and the use of the word kinisa thus suggests a Christian church. Why, then, the " portrait of the Prophet 'Ali "? And how would they, as obvious Muslims, have been allowed to spend the night inside it and even cook a meal? Allowing for the possibility that the monk was just too scared to refuse, it would appear that Ibn Battiita's use of the word kinisa is meant to reflect his own puzzlement as to what the place really was. Secondly, although Ibn Batttita is no less precise about the Shi'i shrines of Mesopotamia which he visited and the special rites of the pilgrims visiting them, he makes no mention of any images there, and it would appear that if at the present time the cult of images is established there this is as much the work of Persian Shi'ism in comparatively recent times as of any tradition associated with the shrines of Iraq. Moreover, the Golden Horde, which ruled the hinterland of Kerch at the time of his visit, was certainly Sunni. Kerch was, however, a port with a large variety of foreign colonies in it, and it is more than possible that it may have contained small pockets of Persian Shi' merchants, who would naturally have had their separate places of worship. There is, therefore, on religious grounds no reason why we should rule out Ibn Batfita's account a priori. 8 Gibb, The Travels of Ibn Batta.ta II (London 1964), P 467; Defr6mery and Sanguinetti, Voyages d'Ibn Battuta II (Paris 1877), pp. 355-6. The italicized words above must be regarded as a series of exclamations at the apparent sense of the text. * Gibb, p. 349; Defr6mery and Sanguinetti, II, p. 137. In one case, however (the Ribit Yfinus near Nineveh, which seems from the collection of lavatories and water channels (matdhir), masjids and mihrHbs which it contains to have been a Muslim place of worship), he says of it ribd.tfhi buylt kathira.</page><page sequence="5">THE GENESIS OF SAFAWID RELIGIOUS PAINTING 129 Thirdly, we have the problem, why si.rat al-nabi 'Ali? Gibb, the most recent translator of Ibn Battiita,10 has suggested that he merely misunderstood his informants, that the edifice was indeed a church and that the painting was actually an icon of Elias (Greek genitive, Elia). This interpretation raises the question of why the church should contain an icon of Elias at all, but it is very difficult to see how Ibn Battita could have come to make such a mistake in the first place. As is well known, the letter 'ayn is extremely persistent in Arabic phonology and is never dropped in favour of alifmadda, as the 'All-Elias transformation would demand. Although Greek monks might hardly be expected to recognize the difference between the two, Ibn Battita himself would certainly have done so, and with his usual pedantry about orthography and divergent pronunciations, would certainly have enquired further. The possibility that the monk was scared and gave the answer which he thought would please most, merely leads to the problem why he gave that particular answer, and not something more innocuous. A Muslim might hardly be expected to take such an answer for granted, and the fact that Ibn Batitta seems to have done so suggests that he at least considered the answer to be well-founded. An examination of alternatives to Elias in Byzantine iconography is of no help either. The Byzantine calendar abounds in warrior saints, but it is difficult to think of any wearing what could be described as a turban. Some Byzantine officials at this period wore costumes superficially resembling Muslim dress, like the turban-like bonnet (the skiadion, or sunshade) and the long khil'a-likell robe of the Grand Logothete or Comptroller of the Imperial Treasury. But there is no evidence that even Byzantine generals, let alone soldiers, wore similar uniforms; that of the Grand Logothete is the only one known to me from Byzantine art.12 As for the suggestion that the kinisa may have been Italian, with a conse- quent Italian origin for the painting which Ibn Battita describes, though it might appear probable on the grounds that there was a large Genoese colony in fourteenth-century Kerch, we may dismiss it out of hand on grounds of style. Fidelity to details of costume, particularly Byzantine or Islamic, is rare in Italian art before the time of Gentile Bellini, who visited Istanbul and Damascus in 1480-81; and it is equally difficult to think of an identification for the figure in terms of an Italian saint. It follows that the objections to Ibn Battfita's admittedly surprising account do not hold and that, on internal grounds, he may well be accurate. Our suspicions may well remain, however, since we have no other even remotely contemporary evidence for such religious paintings in Islam, except, indirectly, an inscription from the Jdmi' al-QOadi in Aleppo, an undated Maml-ik building, written in a fourteenth-fifteenth century Mamlkik naskhi":13 " Cursed be he who concerns himself with images representing living creatures near this mosque, or who erects a statue of a living creature for people to assemble in front of, or who exposes it for sale .. " There follows a quotation of al-Bukhdri's hadith to the effect that the painter at the Last Judgement will be given the impossible task of breathing life into the images he has made. There are many possible reasons for such an emphatic proscription, and the inscription may there- fore merely be ammunition against Christian churches in the vicinity. However, in Mamlfik Syria there can have been few Christian communities confident enough to expose themselves to this form of attack; and, in any case, should the Christians have been scandalizing good Muslims, the remedy would not be to place a comminatory inscription on the wall of a mosque, but to destroy the images and, doubtless, punish the perpetrators. It could also be seen as a purely general reminder to the orthodox not to diverge from the path of virtue, though it is quite unclear why it should have been thought necessary just at this period to make it. Indeed, reflection suggests that it must have had a specific 10 Gibb, op. cit., p. 467. 1x Khil'a is used in a fairly strict sense (see Mayer, Mamluk Costume [Geneva 1953]) to mean a long robe opening down the front, fastened with a belt and very much like a modern dressing gown. The garment is still worn in the Bukhara Oasis, where it is known as a khalat. 12 Underwood, The Kariye Djami I (London 1967), frontispiece and pp. 42-3. Theodore Metochites, the final restorer of the Church of St. Saviour in Chora at Constantinople at the time he occupied the position of Grand Logothete (1321-22), is represented in the magnificent series of mosaics which he com- missioned as being in court uniform. The date is conveniently near that of Ibn Battfita's travels, and it is especially unfor- tunate that Ibn Battuta during his long stay in Constantinople was never able to enter the churches and inspect their decora- tion because (as he tells us) of the requirement that visitors should prostrate themselves before the crucifix in the narthex. 13 Herzfeld, " Inscriptions et Monuments d'Alep " in Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum II, Syrie du Nord (Cairo 1956), pp. 321-2.</page><page sequence="6">130 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES purpose. An analogous case can easily be constructed. Murder is known to be forbidden to all Christians, yet we should never expect to see the commandment " Thou shalt not kill ", with a rehearsal of the special punishments for murderers, as an inscription on a church, unless some particularly flagrant case in the vicinity, or in the church itself, had just taken place and it was thought necessary to give the faithful a good lesson. Although we cannot place any great weight on the occurrence of this inscription it certainly suggests that at the time that it was carved, there had been attempts to introduce paintings of living creatures, or even statues, into the mosque. Just who made the attempt and why is quite impossible to say. Fortunately, the other testimonials which follow are less obscure. Don Juan of Pcrsia, originally a Shi'i Muslim called Uruch Beg, left Persia in 1599 as one of the four secretaries of the Embassy sent to Europe by Shah 'Abbds under the guidance of Sir Antony Sherley. In his Relaciones, written in Spanish after his conversion to Catholicism, he states that his father, 'Ali Beg Baydt, was killed at Tabriz in the Turkish siege of I58o and that Muhammad Khudibanda, the ruler of Tabriz, afterwards ordered a picture to be painted representing 'Ali Beg standing over the seven Turkish commanders whom he had accounted for. The picture, Don Juan says,14 may still be seen placed over the door of the mosque in Tabriz dedicated to the Amir Haydtr, whom he reports to have been held to be a saint (sic: the building is not now identifiable, and it is difficult to know whether he meant wali or not). The account is particularly interesting, since it demonstrates the existence of a genre of which no examples seem to exist at the present time, namely, of funerary portraiture; and because it shows the special considera- tion accorded to Shi'is who had fallen in battle and thus become martyrs. Although this is the only precise literary testimonial known to me, the emphasis which it places upon martyrdom is a very characteristic aspect of the militant Shi'ism of Safawid Persia. A third source, a treatise on painting written by the Qa.di Ahmad c. i6o6, and which deals with the great painters and calligraphers known to him, is of special interest in that it presents the attitude of a thoroughly sophisticated member of the Shi'i 'ulamd' towards painting in a religious context.15 Painting, in the view of the Qadi, is a product of the qalam, itself sanctified by being the instrument by which the Qur'an was written down. It is made even more respectable, however, because of the " miracle- working pictures drawn by the pen of Muhammad and 'All ibn Abi Talib ", the Q?.di even quoting a set of verses in mutaqdrib metre to the effect that one of Muhammad's additional superiorities over the Chinese (!) is that he excelled them in painting images. These protestations might strike one as some- what dubious, since their exaggeration suggests an attempt to persuade unconvinced orthodox Shi'is that portrait painting, being recommended by the highest authorities, was therefore entirely above reproach. There is, in any case, no need to take his claims at their face value-which would in any case be small-and we must see his account more as an apologia for a genre which was widely cultivated but which up to that time had found little theological backing. However, the importance of the move from seeing painting as something at best permissible under certain circumstances to seeing it as some- thing sanctified, as in the case of the father of Don Juan of Persia cited above, cannot be underestimated. The Qadi Ahmad is also interesting in that he uses as his criterion of the goodness of a painting its likeness to life, that is, precisely that quality which had been the ground of its condemnation by the early hadith, since it was precisely in this respect that the painter was held to usurp the creative activity of God. Just how great a revolution this was by the time the Qadi wrote is difficult to say, though it is certainly expressed, in a non-theological context, by 'Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandi in his account of the mission sent by Shah Rukh to China in the I420s. In his lavish descriptions of the Chinese temples seen by the embassy, we find no word of disapproval, and only praise, for the extreme life-like qualities of the statues and painted figures which they contained.'" Once again, it does not matter whether Samar- qandi convinces us that his observations are true or accurate; the important fact is that he should use the criterion of vivacity and likeness to life as criteria of the quality of the painting and sculpture which he saw. 14 Ed.

Samarqandi's judgement is, of course, odd.</page><page sequence="7">THE GENESIS OF SAFAWID RELIGIOUS PAINTING 131 The Qadi's most interesting observation from our point of view, however, is that after lavish praise of Bihzdd he says: " He died at Herat and was buried in an enclosure (rawda, or tomb) full of paintings and ornaments (naqsh-u nigdr)." Minorsky in his commentary" writes that he dare not translate naqsh-u nigdr as " painted images ", since " even for Bihzad, such embellishment for a resting place would be extravagant ". But the extravagance is precisely the point. Bihzdd was still for the Safawids the ideal to which the painter should aspire, and the Qadi is not so much giving a historical account as ascribing to him the sort of praise he felt to be his due. The most important factor is that being buried in a tomb decorated with painted images is thought of as the most appropriate reward for the greatest Persian painter. The Qadi's account is therefore useful as testimony to the question of funerary painting in Persia. Moreover, it is possible that the Qadi was not being entirely fanciful. The tomb of Timur's younger sister, Shirin Biqa Aqa, in the Shdh-i Zinda at Samarqand (1385)18 contains a series of wall paintings with magpies in a landscape of trees, and a number of Chinese phoenixes painted in gold on some panels of the ceramic revetment of the tomb. The motifs are the only occurrence that we have, so that their meaning is unclear. However, it is possible that some reference is intended to the well-known hadith that the souls of those who die for the faith are as green birds in Paradise, which does occur as a funerary inscription elsewhere.19 Equally, as Denike is inclined to suggest, there may be a revival of the tradi- tional Iranian customs of tomb-painting which Mas'fidi describes, but which do not seem to have persisted into the Islamic High Middle Ages. The actual reason does not concern us here; all that is important is that the tomb in the Shdh-i Zinda gives some factual content to the Qa.di's otherwise rather highly-stated claims. The above cases make no pretence to being a complete list of all the references to religious painting in the pre-Safawid period, and it is certainly possible that further researches would bring to light evidence at least as important. It is not clear, however, that they would go any further towards showing exactly what the reasons for the development of religious painting were, and it is perhaps useless to expect a single answer to this question. The most that we can hope to do is to identify the attitude which brought the genre into being and, so far as possible, trace its origins. The third and last part of this article will be devoted to this. The question arises first as to where the attitude which lies behind the development of religious painting first arose. As we have seen, the paintings themselves seem to be restricted to Safawid Persia, and the fact that at the present day paintings appear to be canonized in the Shi'i shrines of Iraq is almost certainly ascribable to the influence of Persian Shi'ism. Although Ibn Battata's account may lead us to suppose that in some Sunni communities Muslim religious painting was tolerated, we should still, I think, have to postulate a Persian colony in Kerch to which the " picture of the Prophet 'Ali " belonged. But at the same time the Shi'i 'ulamd' have not been markedly less hostile to religious painting than the Sunni ones, and it will not do to assert without qualification that religious painting is a necessary characteristic of any Shi'i society. It is true that Shi'ism has been a missionary religion far longer and to a much greater degree than Sunnism. Because of the deep suspicion with which Shi'i Muslims, and particularly the Safawids, were viewed by orthodox Muslims, they were obliged constantly to fight against extermination, and the propagation of the faith depended in large measure upon a highly-trained and informed dlite which could make new converts as orthodoxy killed off the old. Since the propagation of the faith has always occupied an important place in the minds of the 'ulamd' (although they have often depended upon 17 Minorsky, op. cit., p. i8o and note 631. 18 Denike, Arkhitekturny Ornament Srednei Azii (Moscow 1939), p. 202 and fig. 97; Stchoukine, La Peinture des Manuscrits Timourides (Paris 1954),P- 3. They agree that the blue objects in the landscape, which had previously been identified as dragons, are in fact streams. 19 For example, in the mausoleum of the Vizir, Fakhr al-Din 'Ali in Konya (c. 1285). That the inscription should be used in his case points, I think, to the reburial of his two sons there, who had been killed in 1277 in the Jimri episode.</page><page sequence="8">132 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES personal contact to make proselytes, for example, the Shi'i babas of the Janissary regiments in sixteenth- century Turkey), there has been constant awareness of the problem of reaching the non-literate elements of the population. Hence the emphasis has been largely upon teaching by example rather than by precept. This essential feature of Persian Shi'ism stems, as I have suggested above, from the fact that the perfection of 'All has always been a central pre-occupation of Shi'i theology, which gives at least the starting point for the teaching of religion by urging the faithful to follow his example. This central characteristic is well shown by the early appearance in an Iranian context of lives of, and devotion to, Stifi saints, intended not just as edification for the particular community to which the saint happened to belong, but for the faithful at large. An even more important phenomenon is the growth of the ta'zzya,20 the Muharram passion plays which commemorate the sufferings of Hasan and IHusayn, in the Shi'i world as a whole and not just in Persia. Once again, they are presented as an individual example for the faithful to follow, even unto death, in their pursuit of virtue. This is not, of course, to assert that religion by example rather than precept is in no way a feature of Sunnism, but only that in Shi'ism its role is much more central and irreplaceable. The contrast between traditional Sunni views ofjihdd, for example, which is a general duty incumbent upon all Muslims but which is very often seen as having no particular reference to individual cases, is very striking.21 The passion plays have as their purpose not just the re-enactment of certain historical events but a moral and didactic significance as well, the awakening of the mass of the faithful to the urgency of their duty as mujtahidin. The ta'zfya exhibits, in theatrical terms, exactly the requirement which must be stipulated as necessary for the emergence of religious painting. It has often been asserted that these and related aspects of Shi'i piety are due to the influence of Christianity. In the case of religious art this is in one sense undeniable, since many modern paintings of 'Ali are taken almost directly from Western paintings of Christ, and Arnold has shown that as early as the Edinburgh Jdmi' al-tawdrikh, we find the il-Khanid painters using Byzantine originals rather than following the details of the Qur'anic narrative, e.g. in the case of the Annunciation.22 But one must distinguish very carefully between the appropriation of a Christian iconographic tradition and con- tamination by certain Christian dogmas, and in this latter case, there is not, I think, any evidence that Shi'i Muslims at any period were less than sincere in their overt hostility to Christianity. Hence it does not follow that the precise religious beliefs, of which the cult of images in Safawid Persia was an expres- sion, have any more than faint analogies to the religious dogmas which in Christianity justified and encouraged the use of images. Paintings of Muhammad (we cannot call them portraits for there was, as far as we know, no tradition upon which the painters could draw) appear first in the il-Khdnid manuscripts of the early fourteenth century, sc. the 1307 Jdmi' al-tawdrikh and the Athdr al-biqaya of the same year.23 However, so far from being a symptom of the development of a religious art, these occurrences are part of the tremendous concentration upon the history of Persia which makes itself felt as the il-Khdnids became settled, and which, after the conversion of Ghdzdn Khan in 1295, became a concentration upon the history of Islam as well. The Mongols, by identifying themselves with these two traditions, aimed to achieve a sort of literary respectability. This desire and its consummation are very clear if we compare the Tarikh-i Jahdn-gushdy, written by Juwayni (who died in 1283) and Rashid al-Din's Jdmi' al-tawdrikh, written only twenty years later. Juwayni, a Muslim and a Persian, attempts to reconcile his own beliefs with the necessity of not criticizing the r6gime by showing the Mongol invasion of Persia and the Near 20 Y. Godard suggests (loc. cit.) that the ta'zfya can be no earlier than the late seventeenth century, since observant travellers like Chardin and Olearius fail to mention it. We have already seen how inconclusive " observant travellers " may be; and in fact, Tavernier writing in 1667 describes something very comparable to a ta'z4ya. Even so, it is interesting that these passion plays appear to gain in popularity more or less at the same time that the religious paintings under discussion first appear. 21 The Seljuqs and the later Ottomans are, for example, fond of titulature associated with the jilhdd (e.g. qdtil al-kafara wa'l- mushrikin) and of calling themselves ghdzfs; but it is not always easy to see their lives, or their policies, as the pursuit of martyr- dom in the cause of the Faith. 22 Arnold, Painting in Islam (Oxford 1928), p. Ioo and pl. XXIV. 23 The late Bishr Fdris argued that the frontispiece of a volume of the Kitdb al-Aghdni in the National Library in Cairo repre- sents Muhammad engaged in a mubdhala, or ritual exchange of curses, with the Christians of Najrin. However, this theory has been conclusively refuted by Rice (" The Aghani Miniatures and Religious Painting in Islam ", Burlington Magazine [April I953]), who points out that the personage shown, if any historical character is intended, must be the Atabeg Lu'lu' of Mosul.</page><page sequence="9">THE GENESIS OF SAFAWID RELIGIOUS PAINTING 133 East and its accompanying excesses as the punishment of God upon Islam for the deficiencies of Muslims and their failure to observe the precepts of the Qur'an. Twenty years later the position has absolutely changed. Rashid al-Din is concerned to emphasize the historical continuity of the period preceding and following the Mongol invasion. The dynasty has become now the newest of the Islamic dynasties, fully integrated also into the scheme of Persian historiography, and the inconvenient fact that Hiulegii was responsible for the destruction of the Caliphate is nicely glossed over. This important change of viewpoint reflects itself in the illustrations of both the Jdmi' al-tawdrikh and the Athdr al-biqaya, which contain illustrations of a range of historical subjects from the Fall onwards, including both Qur'anic and non-Qur'anic material, as well as a selection of events subsequent to the Hijra. The illustrations of Muhammad and his Companions have importance, however, as history and not as didactic illustration of a theological or moral lesson. Thus, although Muhammad is presented as the last and greatest of the Prophets, he is not distinguished pictorially in any way from other important religious figures, like Buddha, or even from the rulers of the Jdhilfyya. Thus he has no nimbus,24 and the device customary in Persian painting of the fourteenth-fifteenth centuries of enlarging the size of the figures in a painting in accordance with their relative importance, if applied in Il-Khdnid illustration to Muhammad, is also applied to the most important figures in many other compositions in which he is not represented. Nevertheless, these early paintings of Muhammad and the other Prophets are of importance, partly because of the enormous impetus which Il-Khdnid patronage gave to the diffusion of illustrated manu- scripts (which in the later fourteenth century gradually turned from solid history to romance), and partly because of the manner of representing Muhammad and other Prophets, without veiling, nimbus or even enlargement, a manner which persisted even when the intention was to inculcate reverence in the beholder. The most important developments, however, seem to come in the Timurid period in the remains of the Central Asian empire of the Chaghatay Turks. This may well have been due to the Timurid invasion itself which, though scarcely less destructive than that of Chinggis Khan, had entirely different consequences in the cultural field. Timur was not only a Muslim to begin with, but a respectable Persian scholar, so that the long period of adaptation which the il-Khinids underwent in Persia became un- necessary, and his immediate descendants were remarkable for their erudition, refinement and civili- zation. So when their taste turned towards China,25 this was a caprice characteristic of a well- established dynasty and not the efforts of parvenus to acquire a past for themselves. The admiration of 'Abd-al-Razzdq Samarqandi for the vivacity and beauty of Chinese Buddhist sculpture and painting, to which we have already alluded, is the mark of a man thoroughly sure of his cultural and a fortiori religious position.26 More pertinently, the cult of saints itself owes much to Timur and his descendants, not only in the great increase in the foundation of khdnqdhs as memorial constructions,27 but also in a spate of devotional and religious literature: not the mystical, highly obscure, work of much Persian S.ifism, but narrative works, some of which were also allegorical in intention. The taste for religious narrative and biography is not, of course, an invention of the Timurid period, sira-literature having been cultivated in many areas of Islam from its earliest centuries. However, in the Timurid period we may note two important developments, firstly in the unusual quantity and variety of works translated or re-written, and secondly 24 The earliest occurrence of the typical flaming nimbus of Muslim painting seems to be on the Angel Gabriel in the Annunciation miniature of the Edinburgh al-Athdr al-bdqiya (I307), see Stchoukine, La Peinture Iranienne sous les derniers 'Abbasides et les Il-Khans (Bruges 1936), pl. LXIV. But there is apparently no case of a Prophet being represented with such a nimbus before the Topkapi Saray Mi 'raj-ndma (Album, Hazine 2154), possibly to be dated to the first half of the fourteenth century. 25 Amongst the copious literature on the subject one should single out Grube's discussion of some Timurid paintings in the Hazine Albums of the Topkapi Saray (Kunst des Orients V/i [ 1968]) and other collections, which clearly copy Chinese prototypes. 12 26 Quatremeire, Notices et Extraits XIV (1843). The impossibility of a Persian expressing such sentiments in the thirteenth century is not just a matter of religious prejudice, but is part of the deep suspicion which the still uniranicized Mongols, with their tolerance of most religions and favouring of Buddhism, awakened among the 'ulamd', whose high offices had previously depended upon their being orthodox Muslims. 27 See Bartold, " O Pogrebenii Timura " in Sochinenmya II (2) (Moscow 1964), P. 433, for an illuminating discussion of the spread of khdnqdhs in Transoxania as memorial construc- tions.</page><page sequence="10">134 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES the large proportion of them which were illustrated.28 Some of these works seem to be direct transla- tions or recensions of earlier works, for example, Farid al-Din 'Att.r's Mantiq al-tayr and his Tadhkirat al-awliyd', and here the important fact is that they are now illustrated, gradually coming to be designed in a way which might enhance the didactic importance of the text. Others are works of pure devotion, like the Khawardn-ndma, written in 1426 by Muhammad ibn IHusayn and containing the exploits of 'Ali, decorated in a manuscript of c. 1480 with 155 miniatures which are meant to bring out his closeness to God and his pre-eminence among human beings; Jrmi's Nafahdt al-uns (I480), a series of biographies of Sffi saints, and the same author's Shawdhid al-nubuwwa, a biographical account of how Muhammad revealed himself to be a Prophet, both in his lifetime and through his Companions and followers down to the early Sifis; and HIusayn al-Kaishifi's Rawdat al-shuhadd', a book of Shi'i martyrs. These are all works of the type which might properly be called " devotional ". Further examples could be given, but the most interesting development is not so much the content of these new texts but the approach. In this respect the Uighur text of the Tadhkirat al-awliyd', bound in with the Mi'rdj-ndma written at Herat in 1436 by Malik Bakhshi, which is now in the Bibliotheque Nationale, is of particular importance.29 The Uighur text of the Tadhkirat al-awliyd is a fairly exact translation of the earlier work of the same name by Farid al-Din 'Att.r. The translator's preface, however, is strikingly new. 'Att.r's introduction is concerned to say that the lives of the saints are useful primarily to supplement the teachings of hadith, since they are the heirs of the Prophets and in this way have religious authority: in other words, they provide a sort of ijtihdd for the faithful. Malik Bakhshi is much more explicit. He says that to teach religion is a work of merit. To understand the Qur'an is a work of much labour, but since the lives of the saints conform exactly to its precepts, reading their lives is a short cut to sanctity. Their sayings show the faithful which are the true dervishes (sc. the proper examples to imitate), they strengthen resolution, making men of women and lions of men, bringing them to the stage where they are the 61ite whose souls are the very essence of suffering in God's cause.30 The above brief paraphrase is sufficient to show the very remarkable similarity of the sentiments put forward as a justification for reverence for the saints, to the principles held to justify the use of painting first in the Byzantine and then in the Western Churches, sc. painting as a short cut to sanctity, inspiring men with devotion to duty and the love of God and leading even the illiterate to an understanding of the Scriptures. It does not matter, of course, whether Malik Bakhshi's preface to the Tadkhirat al-awliyd' is the first expression of these views in Islam; but it is noteworthy that the type of literature which these views encourage, namely devotional or didactic, accompanies the first appearance of painting which seems intended to be didactic and which is, anyway, intended to inspire reverence in the beholder. There is, it must be admitted, little reason for bringing the analogy with the birth of Christian art even closer by saying that these early Muslim didactic paintings were intended to bring the nature of faith and morals nearer to those who could not read, since the texts with illustrations could hardly have come into the hands of the illiterate at all. However, I think it may fairly be said that these developments in Timurid manu- script painting, in works illustrated in or intended for a Sultan's library, are an important prior condition for the appearance of those paintings in the Safawid shrines of Persia which were intended to make plain the doctrines of Shi'ism to all and to inspire the faithful with enthusiasm and reverence. As I have said above, it is difficult to draw a dividing line. The rather jejune tradition of inserting standard pictures of men to decorate lives of the Prophets certainly persisted into seventeenth-century Istanbul, and there are many other cases where it is clear that the illustrator had no knowledge of the text he was dealing with. However, certain manuscripts, notably the famous Topkapi Kitdb siyar 28 It is, of course, impossible to draw a rigid distinction. Mir 'All Shir Nevd'i, for example, who also wrote a Tadhkirat al-awliyd', the text of which was to serve as the basis for Ottoman versions like the Tdrikh-i Alti Parmdq, also wrote works of purely secular biography like the Tadhkirat al-shu'ard', lives of the poets from whom he had learned. It is probable that even in the sixteenth century many biographical works of Sfifi mystics were not primarily devotional in intention, but the general tendency is clear. Phenomena which should also be taken into account are the rediscovery of the bogus grave of 'All near Balkh, which was refurbished by Ijusayn Bayqard in I480-8I (Bartold, " Mir 'Ali Shir i Politicheskaya Zhizn' " in Sochin- eniya II (2) [Moscow 1964), ch. IV, p. 235) and which became the modern shrine of Mazar-i Sherif. This led to the " dis- covery " of further bogus tombs at Herdt and other places, which eventually were denounced. It illustrates the highly- charged atmosphere of religious enthusiasm which characterizes the later Timurid period. 29 Bibliotheque Nationale, MS Suppl6ment Turc 190.

The Herat Mi'rdj-nama is worthy of closer attention. The subject, the Ascension of Muhammad, was of interest to Muslim theologians long before the fifteenth century, since we have a work by Abu'l-Qasim al-Qushayri (died 074 A.D.) collating and commenting upon the various versions of the Mi 'rdj known to him. However, the textual question is for once less important than the illustrations of the Herat manu- script of 1436, since in the Library of the Topkapi Saray there is a series of early Ascension miniatures cut from the text which they illustrated and pasted at random into an album (Hazine 2154), and with an attribution written in a later hand (possibly that of DUst Muhammad, whose treatise on Persian painters antedates the Qadi Alhmad's by some fifty years) to the legendary Persian painter, Ahmad Mfisa.32 Since it is to Duist Muhammad's treatise that we are indebted for the knowledge that Ahmad Mfisa actually wrote a Mi'rMj-ndma, it would appear that the late attribution-signature is not independent evidence for the authorship of the miniatures. The paintings from the album, Hazine 2154, show a certain stiffness, and although they can fairly easily be related to later texts known to us, they do not suggest that the illustrator felt it important to be faithful to the text. As Ettinghausen has remarked, comparison of the Topkapi illustrations with the Herit manuscript suggests that they must have been of two different texts; but it is scarcely surprising to discover that the iconographic tradition is of greater importance, since much the same point about fidelity to the text might be made in the case of the Herat manuscript. The most important feature of the Herat Mi'rdj-ndma is that each of the fifty-eight miniatures which decorate it is accompanied by an explanation in Anatolian Turkish (one written in a sixteenth century naskhi, and one in a hand nearer to nasta'liq which may be later), in Arabic, and sometimes in Persian as well (in shikasta). This last hand suggests that the commentaries were added in Istanbul, since shikasta does not appear to have been used in fifteenth-century Transoxania. The additions are not surprising: the text in Uighur cannot have been accessible to many at the Ottoman court, and we can readily understand that a commentary should have been thought necessary. What is surprising is that it should be the illustrations which bear the comments, not the text, even though the content of the additions is, as already remarked, closer to the text than what is depicted.33 The obvious conclusion is 31 The text is a translation of Wdqidi by MustafA b. Yfisuf Erzurfimi al-.Darir written in 1388 and re-copied in Istanbul in 1595-96 in the Library of Murad III under the supervision of a naqqdsh-bashi, or head painter. Stchoukine (La Peinture Turque d'apris les Manuscrits illustres (i) : de Sulayman I ' Osman II (152o-1622) [Paris 1966], p. 85) points out that in the first of the six volumes Muhammad is only once represented with his face veiled, which suggests that in later sixteenth-century Turkey there was still a certain latitude about this. The paintings of the Kitdb siyar al-nabf are of especial impor- tance in that they seem to derive from a careful reading of the text. Stchoukine (ibid.) has remarked upon their " archaism ", but if we compare them with the Mi'rdj-ndma illustrations from the Album, Hazine 2154, which have been attributed to Ahmad Mfisd, we shall find that this is not an accurate des- cription. The paintings certainly show a very striking feeling for colour, which is doubtless an intentional way of awakening awe at the events illustrated. But although in this respect they appear to be in the spirit of certain Italian primitives, there is no reason to suppose that the painters in the Library of Murad III were looking back to what was, even then, a remote past. 32 Ettinghausen, Persian Ascension Miniatures of the 14th Century (Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Rome 1957), PP- 360-83. Two Western texts, both thirteenth century, have been published by Cerulli in II Libro della Scala e la Questione delle Fonti Arabo-Spagnole della Divina Commedia (Vatican 1949), and the Uighur text of Malik Bakhshi by Pavet de Courteille (Paris I882). The texts are, of course, quite different. In general, the Uighur text is briefer and more confused, con- flating various different episodes which appear in the Western texts, and considerably altering the order. The one interesting feature, however, which Western and Eastern texts have in common is that they ascribe to God human characteristics, a voice, position (being seated on a throne), though not move- ment and activity. The movement is not new, of course, and under the Seljuqs accusations of tashbih or anthropomorphism had been rife, but it is particularly interesting in the Turkish context. The paintings themselves do not get any further to God than the outermost of the seven veils before the Throne (f. 45 verso of the Uighur manuscript, published in Blochet, Les Enluminures des AManuscrits Turcs, Arabes et Persans de la Bibliothique Nationale [Paris 1926], pl. XXXVII), though the motive for this may well have been reverence, rather than the fear of falling into idolatry which is customarily supposed to have afflicted the 'ulama' with regard to painting. 33 It has not been possible for me to compare all the commentaries with the Uighur text. One example should be sufficient, however, to show that it was the text, rather than the illustra- tions, of the Herdt manuscript which was attached as com- mentary. The Uighur text describing an angel (Pavet de Courteille, text p. 9, translation p. 6) with seventy heads, seventy tongues in each head, each reciting seventy different forms of tasbih, is exactly followed by the commentary in Anatolian Turkish (ver her balinda yetmij dili olup ve hem bir dili yetmis diirlii tesbih okurdu ...) (compare Esin, " An Angel in the Miscellany, Album H.2152, of Topkapi " in Beitrdge zur Kunst des Asiens [Istanbul 19631, p. 279). The Western texts translated by Cerulli (op. cit., pp. 61-3) elaborate somewhat on the possibilities of multiplication, replacing seventy by seventy thousand. The illustration of the Herit manuscript (f. 17 recto) (Blochet, Les Enluminures, pl. XXXVI) has, rather tamely, only thirty-three heads.</page><page sequence="12">136 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES that by the time the manuscript came to be appreciated at the Ottoman court, the paintings it con- tained were viewed as interesting or important in themselves and not just, as so often before, as decora- tion for a text. One of the prior conditions for the existence of religious art is, therefore, fulfilled, namely that the art should stand first, if not independently, so that it can teach or moralize without benefit of text, or at least with only the sort of minimal titling which we find in the Ottoman additions to the Mi'rdj-ndma. Also, this particular case is only one among a whole class of manuscripts in sixteenth-seventeenth-century Istanbul. We still know very little about the origins of this genre of painting (which, one may suggest, is properly called religious) in Turkey, where, in any case, equivalents of modern Shi'i " icons " and of the Safawid wall paintings do not appear ever to have existed. Its development may have been affected, at least in its iconography and possibly in its literary source material as well, by works of medieval and Renaissance piety imported from Europe by the extensive foreign colonies resident in Istanbul; a proportion of these must almost certainly have come into general circulation outside the capital.34 But it is more probable that its origins are to be found in the later Timurid kingdoms of Transoxania. The transmission of manuscripts was enormously facilitated by the sack of Herat in 1507 by the Safawid Shah IsmT'il, who carried off the Royal Library, together with Bihzdd and others of its staff, to Tabriz; and by the subsequent sack of Tabriz itself by the Ottoman Selim I Yavuz, who likewise carried off the Library of the Safawids, and with the painters from it laid the foundations of the Ottoman painting of the later sixteenth century. This is almost certainly the route by which the Herat Mi 'rdj-ndma reached Istanbul, and demonstrates the extent to which the Ottomans had come to be the direct heirs of the Central Asian later Timurid schools. As for the contents of works acquired in this way, I do not think that the Ottomans cared much whether works illustrated were Shi'i or Sunni in sympathy. The fact that Fudiili's Hadiqat al-su'add', a translation of IHusayn al-Kdshifi's Rawdat al-shuhadd', a strongly Shi'i Book of Martyrs, was illustrated in the Library of Murad III in 1596, more or less at the same time as the orthodox Sunni Kitdb siyar al-nabi, certainly does not show that Murad himself was at all heterodox. Although we know that the Janissary regiments came under strong Shi'i influence from their Bektashi bdbds, or imams, the extent of Shi'i penetration in Anatolia is a very vexed question, and it has been so far impossible to determine how far the Shi'i propagandizing in sixteenth-century Anatolia, for which there is concrete evidence, was actually literary. There obviously were pockets of Shi'i influence in Istanbul, and doubtless within the Ottoman court itself. But the transmission of texts and traditions with their illustrations seems adequately explained by the successive sacking of the two great Persian libraries rather than by recourse to our tenuous knowledge of the politico-religious history of Anatolia. The Ottoman taste for didactic, moralizing illustration is therefore of relevance to our subject firstly because it was a development of tendencies already present in the literature and in certain manuscript paintings of the later Timurid kingdoms; and secondly because after its adoption by the Ottomans, it developed in Istanbul in ways comparable to painting in Persia, in particular in its concentration upon the devotional aspects which are already significant in the Kitdb siyar al-nabi of 1595-96. It is no accident 34 The effects of the importation of Italian works make them- selves felt at a much earlier period, though we have by no means so much documentation on the results of the Genoese and Venetian penetration of the Middle East in the il-Khanid period. Leaving aside the extraordinarily Venetian St. George and the Dragon, which occurs, apparently, quite by the way in the Pierpont Morgan Mandfi' al-hayawdn (1295) and which, Mr. Basil Gray kindly informs me, is probably a modern addition, there are a number of paintings which demonstrate that Italian painting was known in Il-Khdnid Persia. One of the most striking of these is a miniature in the fourteenth- century Tabriz style from a series of albums acquired in Istanbul by the Prussian Ambassador, Diez (1784-91) (Ipsiroglu, Saray Alben [Wiesbaden I964], pl. XIX), showing an apparition of the Virgin and Child to two kneeling figures, the Virgin being surrounded by the flaming mandorla later used in Islamic painting for the Prophets of Islam. The setting is of pointed Gothic arches, with the stone coursing carefully drawn in, and with a gallery above containing two (angel) figures playing an organ. We have here a straightforward transference of elements from Italian primitive painting or book-illustration into a setting, doubtless Christian, charac- teristic of north-west Persia. Further evidence is suggested by the report of the Dominican, John of Montecorvino (edited by Yule, Cathay and the Way Thither III [London 19141, p. 53), when he writes that he has had six pictures made (sc. by local craftsmen) illustrating the Old and New Testaments for the instruction of the ignorant, with explanations carved in Latin, Persian and Tarsic (i.e. Uighur), that all may understand. The analogy to the Ottoman addition to the paintings of the Mi- 'raj-nama, is, of course, most striking. John of Montecorvino's pictures, if executed at Peking as his account suggests, must nevertheless have been intended for a Mongol-Persian milieu; otherwise the inscriptions would have been in other languages.</page><page sequence="13">THE GENESIS OF SAFAWID RELIGIOUS PAINTING 137 that the flaming nimbus of the Prophets, given to them in the first place out of piety, becomes more splendid and sometimes even replaces the human figure altogether. Faces are more and more fre- quently veiled, and clothing and gesture become grander as the movement advances, in Ottoman book painting concurrently with the wall paintings of Safawid Persia.35 Painting, as we have said, had tended to develop the sense of its didactic possibilities some consider- able time after the increase in moralizing and devotional literature of the fourteenth-sixteenth centuries. This delay is not just a matter of the greater conservatism or lack of imagination shown by the painters of the time in Persia and Transoxania. Rather, lack of originality, rather than its presence, was the quality most admired in painters, and the greatest praise that writers on painting like the Qadi Ahmad and Duist Muhammad can give,36 even to Bihz.d, is not that he is sensitive or observant or novel, but that he copies well, and that in his copying he merely happened to excel everyone else. This general prejudice, together with a certain taste, perhaps imitating the Chinese, among the Timurids for genre-painting rather than narrative, explains why it is only towards the end of the sixteenth century in both Istanbul and Persia that we see the full development of original narrative painting, and why the taste for religious wall paintings makes itself apparent at more or less the identical period (sc. the late seventeenth century, if we accept only the Imamzddas, but some hundred years earlier if we regard Don Juan's account as relevant). A manuscript of the Mantiq al-tayr, recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum,37 will perhaps serve as a final example. The copy in question was written in Herdt at the court of Husayn Bayqard in 1483. At a slightly later date it was decorated with genre scenes unrelated to the events described in the text in the style of Bihzdd; but before the paintings in the manuscript could all be completed it seems to have been carried off by Shah Ismd'il in the sack of Hertt in 1507. In 16o09 it came to the attention of Shah 'Abbas, who was looking for a suitable present to make to the family shrine at Ardebil. The waqfiyya incorporated into the manuscript states that he had the margins re-drawn and gilded and the four pages which still remained blank filled with fine miniatures, which, it is scarcely surprising to discover, are all narrative or explanatory, in contrast to the fifteenth-century paintings. One of them, a portrait group of the birds themselves (the si murgh, who wander in search of the Simurgh), is so accurately painted that it is possible to give them their Linnaean names; one is of what is apparently the Martyrdom of St. John the Baptist; and the remaining two are of incidents from the well-known tale of the Shaykh of San'in, who denied his faith for love of a cruel Christian maiden, but who eventu- ally returns to the light after she has forced him to keep swine and do various other improper things. In the light of earlier arguments, this change in approach (which could, after all, be merely symptomatic of a general, non-religious, taste for narrative art rather than decorative genre scenes) is worthy of remark, especially since we must bear in mind the possibility that Shah 'Abbas was influenced in commissioning the new miniatures by the consideration that the manuscript was to be presented to the Ardebil Shrine. The date of the waqfiyya, 16o9, thus represents a terminus ante quem, since the transition clearly comes well before the great Ottoman religious miniatures of the late sixteenth century. In fact a translation of the Mantiq al-tayr, by Mir 'Ali Shir Neva'i, copied at Bukhara in 1558,38 is also decorated 35 It would appear that when in fifteenth-century painting Muhammad is shown veiled, as in the possibly fourteenth-century Mi'raj-ndma illustrations from the Topkapi Saray attributed to Ahmad Mfisk, this is the result of later overpainting. In the next hundred years, however, there is a great increase in the use of the veil, only two clear cases being known where Muhammad is shown unveiled: a line drawing in the Topkapi Saray (illustrated in Wilkinson and Gray, Persian Miniature Painting [London/ Oxford 19331, pl. XCV), and in a manuscript of Nizdmi (illus- trated in Guest, Shiraz Painting in the i 6th Century, Freer Gallery of Art Oriental Studies, I [Washington 1949], no. FGA o8.278), where the Mi 'raj serves as the frontispiece to the Iskandar-ncma. Mrs. Guest, to whose work I am indebted for these examples, makes the point, with which I fully agree, that the principal reason for the veiling of the face was pietism. In the later period the point applies to historical works as well, since, for example in a manuscript of Mirkhwind's Rawdat al-Safa', dated 595 (Arnold, Painting in Islam, pl. XXI) Muhammad is also shown with veiled face. 36 Dfist Muhammad, it is true, credits Ahmad Mfisd with having drawn the veil from the face of painting and inventing " the style of painting current at the present day " (sc. c. 1550) (Wilkinson and Gray, Persian Miniature Painting [London/ Oxford 1933], pp. I83-4), but this is the only occasion known to me on which a painter is given credit for his originality. Nor does the judgement, it might be said, reflect much credit upon Dfist Muhammad's powers of discrimination. 37 Grube, " The Seventeenth Century Miniatures in the Lan- guage of the Birds ", Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of" Art (May 1967). 38 Bibliotheque Nationale, MS Suppl6ment Turc 996.

It may, of course, be questioned whether this clearly identifiable phenomenon of the development of didactic, moralizing and even devotional painting in books, which we can attribute to the predominantly Sunni society of Transoxania of the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, has any necessary connection with the development in Safawid Persia of Shi'i wall painting. For in contrast to paintings decorating the walls of a shrine, book-painting-even given the tremendous impetus to the diffusion of manuscripts by the dynasties which followed the two Mongol invasions-can never have been a public art. It is, indeed, only as a result of the creation of Royal Libraries in the fifteenth century that we have any real know- ledge of the painting of these, or earlier, periods.39 Exactly the same objection might be brought against the present hypothesis as that which was brought against the view that Shi'i religious painting might have developed as a result of Christian influence: that similar phenomena may be the expression of radically opposed religious beliefs. However, I think that the evidence sketched above is too strong for this particular objection to hold. In a society where even the Shi'i 'ulamd' had expressed themselves so violently against the representation of living things (and there is no reason to disbelieve Chardin's testimony on this point40) we must look not only for changes in taste but for changes in the approach to the teaching of religion. And to the traditional emphasis which Shi'ism has placed upon the good life as a matter of imitating the martyrs and other saints, the development in the later Timurid courts of a literature, and then painting, concerned with the teaching of morals and religion by example, comes as the ideal complement. In these special circumstances, the temporal discrepancy between the developments in book- painting and the first dated religious wall paintings known to us (at the Imdmztda Shah Zayd in Isfahan, dated to 1685-86 by a restoration inscription) is not too serious a problem. The literary testimonials advanced above allow us to posit the existence of important religious paintings, of the type of the funerary portrait of Don Juan's father, at least a century previously. This makes it therefore more plausible to suggest that the Safawids themselves had some responsibility; with their expansionist campaigns of the early sixteenth century and their insistence upon the exalted religious status of their rulers,41 the didactic approach shown in the wall paintings was the ideal way of teaching those who could not otherwise be reached by reading or preaching. The foregoing argument has been necessarily somewhat diffuse. I have attempted to deal with the phenomenon of Safawid religious painting in monuments of the late seventeenth century not by studying the iconography of the paintings, but by endeavouring to trace the growth of certain attitudes towards the teaching of religion in the post-Mongol period in Persia and Central Asia. These were characterized by the development of a taste for didactic and devotional works, expounding the virtues of the saints, prophets and martyrs of Islam to the faithful and encouraging them in the path of heroic virtue. The texts, though often written by Shi'i Muslims, seem to have been read by Sunnis as well (as, for example, in the Library of the Ottoman Sultan Murad III), and the precise religious sympathies of the audience do not appear to have had very much to do with the question. In l1-Khdnid Persia historical works presented Islam and Muhammad predominantly in their historical aspects, in order to underline the continuity of the Mongols with the 'Abbasid Caliphate, which had come to an end as a result of the activities of Hiilegii. After the Timurid invasion, when the conquerors had no need to assert their relationship either to Islam or to the Iranian tradition, taste turned towards the heroic, rather than the purely historical, aspects of Islam, and the inculcation of heroism by recounting the life and works of men of pre-eminent virtue. These were often Si.fis, of course, but given the Siifi custom of taqfya and 8 With the exception of scientific works, of medicine, botany, astronomy and engineering (for example, al-Jazari's Kitdb ft ma'rifat al-hiyal al-handasiyya with its diagrams of automata), illustrated manuscripts in Islam have rarely found their way outside royal libraries. There is, of course, nothing exceptional in this. Where illustrations are not necessary for the under- standing of a text, as they would be in the majority of scientific works, they indicate by their presence little more than a taste for the greatest luxury possible. Exactly the same point can be made about Byzantine book-illustration; see Wessel's illu- minating article " Buch-illustration " in Reallexikon zur Byzantinischen Kunst, fascicule V (Stuttgart 1965). 40 Loc. cit. 41 For example, the habit of Shdh Ismd'il's troops, noted by the Venetian traveller Contarini, of crying as they went into battle " Ismd'il wali Allah ".</page><page sequence="15">THE GENESIS OF SAFAWID RELIGIOUS PAINTING 139 the consequent concentration of Sfi commentators upon often obscure allegory, it is rather striking that so much of the Timurid and post-Timurid devotional literature should be comparatively straight- forward. Painting followed in the course of this development, though more slowly, because the tradi- tion (established in so much Byzantine painting) of book illustrations as sheer decoration to increase the costliness of a work, died hard, and because innovation in much of the painting of this period came in spite of the painters, who saw their chief job to be that of copiers. This already favourable milieu for the development of religious painting was aided still further by the Safawid conquest of Persia and the declaration of Shi'ism as the state religion. Faced on all sides by enemies whose orthodoxy gave them a pretext for making war on Persia, it became even more urgent for the Safawids to adopt new ways of encouraging their armies and the populace to remain strong in their religious beliefs; here, the requirements of politics and religion exactly coincided. One may regard the seventeenth-century wall paintings at Isfahdn of 'All and of the martyrdom of Hasan and IHusayn as a recognition, some little time after the event, of the potentialities of large pictures as a means of instruct- ing the faithful. It has been important to lay some stress on the above points, for studies of the iconography of the paintings may lead us to different conclusions, particularly in regard to the sources of the subject matter. From the Zand period onwards, Persian painting has certainly been highly indebted to Italian sources, particularly to works of piety popularized doubtless by the Franciscan missions. But, as I have emphasized, this does not license us to say that the religious forms, of which these paintings are an expression, were themselves influenced by Christian doctrine. Thus although we may agree that the reasons for the development of a Shi'I religious iconography may have been much the same as those which, in the early centuries of the Church, were used to canonize religious art, it is scarcely plausible to suggest that the Shi'i 'ulamd' could at the instance of some Christian missionary have changed their views on the advisability of religious painting. Having said this, one must note that the iconographic sources of these Safawid wall paintings are so far unstudied. The problem, which I have deliberately avoided in this article, of how it could become possible for artists in the often violently anti-Christian society of Safawid Persia to reconcile themselves with borrowed Christian subjects and styles, remains unsolved.</page></plain_text>
