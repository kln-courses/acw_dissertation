<plain_text><page sequence="1">FERR?'S POLYMYTHIC PERSONALISTIC ORGANICISM: AN APPRECIATIVE CRITIQUE* J. Harley Chapman / William Rainey Harper College . In Frederick Ferr?'s masterful and recently published trilogy1 the analysis of religion occurs in the context of ethics, falling in his concluding volume between his organicist-cum-personalist treatment of ethical judgment in general (Part One) and the application of such to specific issues in nature and culture (Part Three). As Ferr? puts it: we need to consider the widest environment of all, the value lens through which all ethical judgments are colored, consciously or not. Rich with both preferences and beliefs, I call this ultimate context religion."2 In successive chapters of Part Two he considers religious world models, the question of God, and the problem of ugliness and evil. This essay will focus on his understanding of religious world models and the metaphysical implications of such, at least as Ferr? understands them. I will argue that (1) while his notion of religious world model in general is seminal and his specific proposal for our time, polymythic personalistic organicism, is highly commendable, even if difficult to achieve, (2) the implied metaphysics is inadequate to ground his religious insights. I propose instead a theory of ontological creativity, which, so I claim, better meets the explanatory need; consequently, I urge Ferr? to consider it. *I wish to thank Frederick Ferr? and other members of the Highlands Institute Seminar, June 2001, for the kind reception of, and spirited discussion on, the oral presentation of this paper. Particular thanks go to Jennifer Jesse, Nancy Frankenberry, and Jean Berglof Chapman for their efforts in making the essay more coherent and readable.

For a number of years, and consistently so, Ferr? has made an essential connection between religion and value. In 1967, he wrote: "[Religion is] one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively."3 Recently he wrote: "what ties all religion together is worship, the acknowledgment of some compelling value (worthship), rather than specific doctrine, which tends to arise in support of intensely felt value." And again: "Religion is not ethics but, as the most intensive and comprehensive way of valuing, embraces ethics by providing a value-drenched vision of the finally relevant state of affairs within which all ethics finds its moorings." Finally: "Religion is what I call whatever provides the final, governing context of our lives," which includes feelings and actions as well as beliefs.4 Since he is interested in how religion functions, he can include a wide variety of beliefs, policies, rituals, behaviors, and attitudes, which can elicit actions and provide orientations for human lives whether or not such clusters of meanings are denominated standardly religious or not. Thus the salute of the neo-Nazi skinhead saluting at an Idaho compound, a beshawled Jew praying at the Wailing Wall, and the respectful Catholic kneeling at High Mass at St. Peter's are engaged in religious activity, assuming in each case that the gesture is motivated by values providing an ultimate context of meaning for those individuals. Yet Ferr? is not primarily interested in whatever could function as religious but what in fact does, and does so for groups as well as for individuals. He is interested in the great archetypal images which shape cultures and persons, providing them inspiration, succor, and orientation for thought and action, and solace in the face of tragedy, loss, and death.5 3 Ferr?, Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1967), 82. 4 Ferr?, Living, 147, 157, 145, respectively. 5 The mention of "functional" language needs clarification. In the first place, since for Ferr? religion is primarily a matter of practical reason, he is interested in the affective and conative aspects of religion. Imagery expresses and arouses feeling, inspires worship, challenges habits, calls for commitment etc., i.e., religion does things and the language of religion is used to do them. Verificational analysis, promoted so vigorously and vehemently by the Logical Positivists, is not the whole story, nor even the</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 23. No. 1, January 2002 15 For Ferr?, religion is, first of all, a matter of imagery, of myth and metaphor, and of feeling. If an image or cluster of images take on an organizing function so that people can live richly and wholly, then a religious world model develops, especially if it evokes reflective thought. Such reflection is usually done in community and over time, but the intellectual activity undertaken?extending, applying, and testing for adequacy?is practical, not theoretical, reason. Imagery is accepted if, but only if, it catches the living waters, that is, if it re presents values needed for life orientation, for making sense of things. As Ferr? spells6 it out, a religious world model has three necessary components: (1) as a model, it stands for something other than itself; (2) as such, a religious world model re-presents the world, that is, it intends comprehensively the whole universe; and (3) as religious, it engages intense valuational affect, that is, it is "hot." If conditions one and two obtain, but not three, we might have a metaphysical model, possible interesting, but not fully a religious one. If only conditions one and three are present, we might have a powerful image, effective in a limited domain, but the needed comprehensiveness would be lacking. If conditions two and three obtain, but not one, and consequently no referential function is intended, then no cognitive value could be claimed even if we are left with an image capable of organizing feeling and conation. Western culture has produced primarily a theistic religious world model with various sub-variants (Jewish, Christian, and Islamic).Worship (worth-ship) is directed toward one god with personal characteristics of freedom, sovereign power, purposive intelligence, creativity, moral goodness, and love towards his (yes, his) creatures. It has been given theoretical elaboration in various metaphysical systems available (Philo and Augustine making use of Plato; Maimonides, Thomas, and the great Islamic thinkers making use of Aristotle?to beginning of such, though there are quasi-cognitive and descriptive elements in religious language. A more flexible approach, favored by J. L. Austin, the later Wittgenstein, and others, includes functional analysis and focuses on the uses of language, the emotive, conative and heuristic, to name several. However, I do not intend to claim that Ferr? is proffering a functionalistic theory of religion, which claims that religion exists/persists because it does x. See the treatment of functionalism in religion in Nancy K. Frankenberry and Hans H. Penner, eds., Language, Truth, and Religious Belief: Studies in Twentieth-Century Theory and Method in Religion (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1999), Part Two. 0 Ferr?, Living, 146.</page><page sequence="4">16 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy name just a few). A model has more staying power and more coordinating reach than an image; but it is not yet a theological system. It is at the heart of the functioning religious outlook of whole communities and cultures. It is that which orients ordinary women and men, and it is that to which the theologian and the metaphysician return again and again. Western culture has seen the emergence of rival world models both in science and in metaphysics. These two have made profound impress on who we are and what we value. For example, one need only think of what the evolutionary model has done to challenge, upset, confound, re-orient, and free people in Western culture (and beyond): the introduction of fundamental change into the understanding of history; the inauguration of a dynamic understanding of human identity and the nature of society; the re-working of all notions of nature and cosmic time; and the challenge to all thinking about the Divine. Ferr? has made a major contribution in that he took the issues of science and religion to another level of understanding through focusing on models, with their rooting in the soil of metaphor and myth, and through clarifying how values shape those models, whether religious, scientific, or metaphysical. Concentrating on models allows for a more fruitful comparison of theories in conflict and yields a seasoned hope that more light than heat may yet break forth. While the current cultural situation of conflict among models, especially religious ones, may prove to be creative, it is certainly not without some pain, which he once expressed as follows: I must confess that the present moment seems to be a time "between models" for me and for many others, a time when we are required to acknowledge our nakedness with whatever rueful dignity we can muster and admit that despite our cravings?of which we need not be ashamed?we do not understand as well as we might wish.7 More recently Ferr? has ventured a model of organicism suggested by the fundamental postmodern science of ecology where mutuality, fulfillment within limits, sufficiency, balance, and equilibrium are central features. On such, Sky Father will yield to Earth ''Ferr?, Basic, 448.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 23, No. 1, January 2002 17 Mother, and the hegemony of the paternalistic religions of Western culture will now be at end. The straight-line, progressivist model of modern scientific culture will seem no longer to fit our fundamental perceptions and valuations.8 Ferr? is of the opinion that his ventured organismic model can fruitfully modify existing religious world models such as the theistic, and more specifically, the Christian and the Jewish. Specifically, Ferr? proposes a polymythic personalistic organicism (PMPO), which, as a religious world model, is an organismic outlook or world view, utilizing personalistic values of consciousness, creative freedom, and moral sensitivity, and which draws on the pluralism of imagery of the world's religions. Ferr? calls this a "dream of wider postmodern ecumenism."9 Such a dream needs a worldview capable of doing two things: (1) supporting an ethic, biophilic and cooperative, of social justice and ecological responsibility, and (2) permitting alternate religio-cultural modelings by quite different traditions. This is reminiscent of William James's "over beliefs," religious beliefs that grow beyond their theoretical underpinnings.10 The interplay among the profusion of myths and articulated beliefs of the ensuing ecumenical discussions can be fruitful for raising the consciousness of all participants; wider conflicts need not necessarily result. This dream is capable of supporting the religions and spiritualities of theists of all sorts, polytheists, and non-theists. This is the polymythicism which his independent metaphysical vision of personalistic organicism supports. This pluralism of sensitive and serious religious positions and persons aiming at cooperative ethical behavior in a beloved and defended natural environment excludes only those who would worship evil and ugliness, foster spiritual egoism, and engage in exploitation and oppression. Ferr? speaks of this as a "religious posture" and "religious stance" which he, like other persons between models, assumes.11 At other times Ferr?'s PMPO seems more like a metaphysical or meta-religious world model?a model in that it re-presents something else, comprehensive in its reference to the entire universe, yet lacking the emotionally "hot," intense valuational affect. It seems 8 Ferr?, Hellf?re and Lightning Rods: Liberating Science, Technology, and Religion Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis Books, 1993), 85-86.

Perhaps, if the wider ecumenical dream can be intimately associated with some more "local" traditional religious model, say a theistic one, even one enriched by modern science or, better, ecological thought, Ferr?'s PMPO could allow movement both toward genuine worship and toward the profoundest of metaphysical speculations.12 III. In the previous section of this essay I discussed Ferr?'s notion of religious world model, a notion quite fruitful for sorting out conflicts among various worldviews. Models are rooted in imagery stimulated by values and move toward conceptual elaboration shaped by the currently accepted "ideals of the natural order"13 and the norms of theory 121 suspect that Ferr? has done something like this. He draws heavily but creatively on Whitehead's philosophy of organism plus his own brand of personalism emphasizing consciousness, creative freedom, and moral responsibility. Taken singly and together, so Ferr? thinks, these positions allow but do not require a view of God as a central, coordinating agency of the universe; neither Whitehead's view of God nor the traditional proofs for God's existence are theoretically coercive. Ferr? is inclined to doubt that such a central, coordinating cosmic agency exists and believes that a non theistic metaphysics can be constructed: creativity and possibilities granted, the actual entities themselves as the world's "many" could account for "the thrust to novelty" {Living, 205). However, Ferr? has been strongly shaped by the religious world model of Christian theism and finds that with appropriate modifications, suggested by modern science and now particularly by ecosystem ecology, "the leading postmodern science" (Being, 316), that religious world model still has vitality and beauty. The imagery displayed and the values stimulated allow for increased awareness, insight into aspects of the universe that might be otherwise overlooked, orientation and support for lives, and the challenge to live better. Ferr? is working both from a process-cum-personalist metaphysics and with elements from a more traditional religious world model to establish a "context of contexts" for making caring and just ethical judgments and for engaging in appropriate actions. The resulting position is complex and subtle and worthy of further elaboration. 13 This phrase was coined by Stephen Toulmin to give expression to whatever "stands to reason" to the community of scientific interpreters at a given time, as in Newtonian physics the uniform straight-line motion of bodies needs no explanation and must be assumed to explain other things. Of course, the history of science is littered with discarded "ideals," nonetheless, explanation requires such. See ToulmhTs Foresight and Understanding (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1961), quoted in Ferr?, Living, 151.</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 23, No. 1, January 2002 19 construction. Religious world models are generally shared by most members of the relevant social unit, whether family, tribe, nation, or culture. But religious world models do not float in or hover over a culture; rather, they are rooted in the primary experiences of individuals and their valuings. We must now raise questions about the "pre-model" issues of experience and value. And, finally, religious world models refer to reality, and issues of the nature and metaphysical status of the religious referent must now be addressed. These concerns will occupy us for the remainder of this essay. As noted earlier, Ferr? has wisely and effectively linked religion and value. Religion, he writes, is "the most comprehensive and intensive way of valuing," the centerpiece of which is worship (worth ship), "the acknowledgment of some compelling value."14 What is it, we might ask, about some value or other that would evoke such a response from us? What is it that would cause one to rank a value as supreme or compelling or to call it sacred? Not all values have that effect. Some values, for instance, a bird's song or the color red, we might label aesthetic?important, but not supreme. In an earlier publication, Ferr? discussed technology and the worship of technique, indicating that the mysterium tremendum as defined by Rudolf Otto is the essential religious experience.15 How is the act of valuing most intensively and comprehensively related to the experience of the mysterium tremendum? It is conceivable that the act of valuation might be independent of such experiences of the mysterium, and conversely. Might it be that a person living between religious models chooses a value or set of values and orders her or his life thereby without having any experience of the mysterium tremendum! Could it be that a person has one or more experiences of the mysterium tremendum?as in watching a Saturn spacecraft blast off or in witnessing an execution? and not value anything intensively and comprehensively? Is there an essential connection between having a religion and having an experience of the mysterium tremendum! If so, what? Might it be that part of the current agony of Euro-American culture is that there are seemingly no comfortable and convincing connections between such profound experiences and the religious options of the present? Running through the questions above is another: do values act? Do they have energy, that is, are they able to lure, dazzle, provoke. 14 Ferr?, Basic, 82 and Living, 147, respectively. ]5FeneJIell?re, 129.</page><page sequence="8">20 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy challenge, and bless? Ferr?'s theory does not avail itself of the erotic power of Plato's Forms or of Whitehead's God. Or might it be argued that values are simply abstract possibilities waiting to be valued, that is, abstracted and incorporated into an actual entity's act of self-becoming? The first alternative, a "hot" possibility, seems to square with the findings of the phenomenology of religious experience, as the worldwide accounts of religious experiences with their humblings, naughtings, overwhelmings, victimizings, and elevatings amply attest. The second, a "cool" option, seems better to fit certain metaphysical analyses of the cosmic process with its infinitely manifold acts of self constitution and value-achievements, such as Ferr? prefers. Part of the problem for me, at any rate, is the felt dissonance in Ferr?'s thought between the urbane and the passionate, the "cool" and the "hot." In Ferr?'s reading of the theistic religious world model, the centerpiece is a cosmic person?conscious, purposely creative, and morally good. As a model, it represents (re-presents) something other than itself: as representing the world, it is comprehensive in that it refers to the whole universe; as religious, it engages intense valuational affect. Ferr?'s way of talking about this model suggests that this cosmic person is somehow essentially within the universe and related to everything else. I think this interpretation is not historically accurate. By and large, the theistic religious world model has re-presented something transcendent to the cosmos but present in and related to each aspect and each particular of the universe ("Maker of all things visible and invisible"). In part, this may be a semantic issue, but Ferr? has been challenged for a number of years about the referent .16 A second issue about the use of the conscious, purposely creative, and morally good cosmic person to articulate the religious world model of theism is its one-sidedness. Ferr? is not responsible for the way that the tradition has handled the more honest (because more unconscious) imagery about God. He should, however, be alert to the limitation of seeing the divine, theistically considered, as the totally conscious, creative, and morally good cosmic person. (Also, to the degree that Ferr? makes use of a strand of personalistic thought for his own constructive position, he should not restrict his model to qualities of consciousness, creative freedom, and moral goodness. There is more i0Kent Bendali in Kent Bendall and Frederick Ferr?, Exploring the Logic of Faith: A Dialogue on the Relation of Modern Philosophy to Christian Faith (New York: Association Press, 1962), 136.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 23, No. 1, January 2002 21 to essential personhood than those qualities?genderedness, allowing relationship, and unconsciousness, allowing personality growth, are two obvious and additional qualities.) Why the objectionable limitation? Both current literary studies and personality theory have no difficulty seeing the ample testimony in the Jewish and the Christian Scriptures of a character given to rage and cruelty, needing praise and honor, and prone to emotional outbursts, features that suggest a considerable level of unconsciousness, anxiety, and self-doubt. I have no intention of psychoanalyzing God, but the unmistakable evidence of the Bible, for example, is that God simply cannot be represented as a fully conscious and unambiguously morally good cosmic person. I suspect that Ferr? knows there is more to personality, even divine personality, than the tradition has admitted. In the religious world model suggested by the postmodern science of ecology, and by organismic thinking generally, there is a new appreciation for mutuality, cyclically, equilibrium, symbiosis, fulfillment within limits?in a word, with non-hierarchical, non paternalistic patterns. In the ecological model the kingly Sky God of the patriarchal religions has been dethroned and replaced by Mother Earth, or Gaia. Lifting up the imagery and values of organicism in general, and feminist religious imagery in particular, is warmly to be embraced as long overdue and currently necessary for cultural survival. (To his great credit, Ferr? is making both theoretical and practical space for cultural development and transformation.) However, this bringing in of feminine imagery should be seen as balancing, not supplanting, the traditional masculine imagery and values enshrined in politics, psychology, family and social organization, and religion. Hierarchy cannot be fully dispensed with, nor should it, since we have levels of responsibility and authority in educational, military, industrial, and political organizations. Families, even healthy and loving ones, are not, nor should they be, democracies. An authentic masculine psychology cannot forswear its "king" energies (nor authentic feminine psychology, its "queen" energies).17 We should not expunge "O Worship the King, All Glorious Above" from our hymnbooks, but we must infuse the Feminine Divine into song, prayer, meditation, and ritual. The best hope for new, more satisfying cultural offspring is for Sky Father and 1 For an extended argument on this point sec Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette, King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1990).</page><page sequence="10">22 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Earth Mother to sleep together.18 Implicit in this imagery of the Divine Pair is a further, more metaphysical point: ontological transcendence cannot be reduced to, or replaced without remainder by, ontological immanence?through kenosis, historical dialectics, conceptual fatigue or neglect, or by fiat. This point will be elaborated in what follows. Ferr? is given to locutions that betray his calling as a metaphysician: "the ultimate scheme of things," "fundamental reality as a whole," "ultimate reality," "the entire universe," and "the profoundly real," to cite just a few.19 There is an ambiguity in these expressions, one that was pointed out forty years ago by Kent Bendall, who co authored with Ferr? Exploring the Logic of Faith.20 "Ultimate reality" suggests the possibility of something " 'hidden behind' nature and history," some reality transcending "the entire universe" or "reality as a whole." The oscillation between "ultimate reality" and "reality as a whole" requires that we attempt to clarify what kind of metaphysician Ferr? is. Metaphysics, as I understand it, has to do with trans-empirical speculation, three levels of which I distinguish: the cosmological, the transcendental, and the ontological. Cosmology is that theoretical discipline which attempts to frame a coherent set of categories drawn 18 This language may appear hopelessly anachronistic to some. But as a matter of cultural evolution the value of such needs to be understood and appreciated. For example, Jews worldwide pray to the King of the Universe and millions of Christians pray weekly to the Father in Heaven, which is Sky-God-talk pure and simple. I doubt that the imagery could be excised, certainly not easily or quickly, owing to (1) the inertia of traditions, (2) the co-implication of values and imagery, (3) the culturo historical nature of the human soul, and (4) the inevitable anthropomorphism of theism, a point well?and rightly?understood by both Ferr? and Feuerbach. Arid since religion has to do with intensive valuation, the emotionally powerful language of family and all that such connotes will be a shaping influence in religious experience, imagery, and model. Ferr? wisely accepts that, yet he is working to expand the existing theistic model with all its imagery and valuations toward a more inclusive, ecumenical, and ecological model. This is admirable, yet hard and risky, work, and the task is too great to be accomplished alone. As to the suggestion that Sky Father and Earth Mother sleep together, I take my tongue out of my cheek long enough to say that ( 1 ) the blending of opposing perspectives can take place only if people are close enough to feel and to enjoy each other, and (2) the denying of sexuality to the God of Jews, Christians, and Muslims has had an enormously baleful effect on the culture's three-millennium struggle to come to grips with human sexuality. For the sake of cultural survival, let us encourage the joyful sexual embrace of Sky Father and Earth Mother. 19Ferr?, Living, 163, 150, 170, 146, and 149, respectively. 20 Bendall, 136.</page><page sequence="11">Vol. 23, No. 1, January 2002 23 from experience which will best explain the whole. It makes use of the method of empirical generalization by which the most salient features of some paradigmatic experience are, by an analogizing leap of the imagination, applied to all experience. Thus, one may take as primary, such cosmological categories such as "substance," "event," "feeling," "person," "monad," "complex," "process," and the like. The system, coherently articulated, is testable, though never easily or simply, in terms of how well it illumines and enriches experience. For example, one might ask whether Whitehead's notion of an enduring object, a serially ordered society, adequately accounts for the continuity of intention apparently embodied in a personal act. Or again, whether Aristotle's notion of a substance adequately accounts for the sense of change, novelty, and freedom which seemingly characterizes our experience in its most primordial aspect. The value in framing a cosmological hypothesis is that it provides a system of the lowest level of abstraction applicable to the whole of experience (cf. Ferr?'s "fundamental reality as a whole"); and as such, it is the closest of all comprehensive and abstract systems to experience. It helps us to see the world as a whole, at least in terms of its most important features. Another level is possible, however, and this has to do with the most general and abstract features which any determinate thing has, insofar as it is determinate (and what kinds of things there are will have been decided by the cosmology chosen). It might be argued that any determinate thing must have an "inside" and an "outside" or essential and non-essential features (Weiss), possess form (Aristotle), be actual or a component of what is actual (Whitehead), or be a harmony (Neville).This is the level of transcendental analysis and implies an aprioristic or transcendental move; it asks for the necessary conditions for, and the transcendental properties of, any determinate thing. It is not directly derivable from experience as the cosmological categories are, nor is it either directly confirmable or disconfirmable by experience. A final level, ontology, attempts to account for the questions raised in transcendental analysis: Why are there harmonies at all? What is the condition for the intelligibility of the world? What is it that in terms of which any two contingent things are related and distinguished? Why is there something rather than nothing9 and the like. Obviously,</page><page sequence="12">24 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy the particular condition (or conditions) for the features exemplified in transcendental analysis is (or are) relative to those features.21 Metaphysicians differ according to what they take as the root metaphors enshrining their fundamental insights and whether their interests and skills incline them toward cosmology, transcendental analysis, or ontology. It is the case that metaphysicians often employ all three levels in various combinations with the accent falling on one. What kind of metaphysician is Ferr?? I consider him to be primarily a cosmologist, which means that he is interested in describing the things?events, abstractions of all kinds, entities of all sorts?that, along with their interactions, make up the universe, the whole of determinate things. Unlike Whitehead, Ferr? sees no need to posit a god, a "unified cosmic experiencer, benevolent and all-knowing, an actual agency with purposes and causal powers."22 Further, "the possibilities of the universe do not need a central depository . . . they can adequately be related to actuality (conforming to the ontological principle) through the infinitely many pulsations that make up the world."23 Somehow things in the universe hang together sufficiently for Ferr? to dispense with a centralizing agency and depository for possibilities?in short, a god? and this even though the "universe" etymologically is a "one-turning" and suggests some pivot or integrating agency. Why do we say "one universe"? Could the science fictionists with their alternate, even multiple, universes be onto something? Could we do philosophy believing that there are in fact two (or more) actual universes? Presumably there is enough de facto harmony or actual coherence in the universe to make possible rational exploration of it in science and philosophy. Frankly, we cannot engage in theory construction or critique of any sort unless we assume, relative to the domain in question, a whole more or less rationally penetrable. 211 have taken the last three paragraphs above with some minor modifications from my Jung's Three Theories of Religious Experience (Lewiston, . Y.: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1988), 143-145.1 am indebted to Robert C. Neville, The Cosmology of Freedom (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974), 26-27, for his discussion of the three levels. I have substituted the expression 'transcendental analysis" for his "metaphysics" after many frustrating attempts to talk with metaphysicians about these distinctions. I doubt whether there can be much agreement on these issues, owing to the very nature of the discipline. 22 Ferr?, Living, 177. 23Ferr?, Being, 268.</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 23, No. 1, January 2002 25 As a cosmologist, Ferr? is justified in dispensing with a notion of god. God is not one of those things, even a Most Eminent thing, within the universe of determinate things. Let the universe be as dynamic, as vibratory, as kalogenic (beauty-creating) as one might wish; one does not need a cosmological god. Cosmology can and should be as naturalistic an affair?profoundly sensitive to values of all sorts, let us hope?as non-theistic religious naturalists and Whiteheadians-without-God want it to be. However, this is not all that needs to be said on this matter on both experiential and theoretical grounds. Let us first consider the evidential basis for suggesting that a determinate cosmos does not nor cannot provide a sufficient account for the whole of experience: the numinous, the mysterious, and the mystical. Each of these types of experience is, of course, deserving of extended individual treatment, and the differences among them are noteworthy; but there are important elements of commonality. We can say with some confidence that in each case something in the cosmos?a natural or cultural thing, an event, a place, a person or group?is experienced for what it determinately is and for something more and other than itself This MoreOther cannot be included within the spatial, temporal, or even axiological categories of the cosmology. To give one specification of this claim: ecstatic experiences of the aforementioned sorts at one level take place within a temporal sequence; they are datable;24 yet the MoreOther experienced within the temporal event is experienced as 24 A classical example of this point is Pascal's account of his ecstatic experience: Memorial In the year of grace 1654 Monday 23, November, the day of St. Clement Pope and martyr and others in the Roman Martyrology the eve of St. Chrysogonos, Martyr, and others, etc.. ..

Moreover, with regard to the issue of determination, we must say that, of course, this MoreOther belongs to a "universe of discourse" and is to that degree determinate, that is, it is a "thing" of discourse. But the issue here is not language, but ontological reference. Since this "something" is not restricted to, is not "in," the cosmos, it can be talked about only in a peculiar way?metaphorically, not literally. If this were not difficulty enough, add to this the seeming lambency, ephemerality, and uniqueness of the appearance of this MoreOther in some cosmological thing/event, and one does not have enough stability of the object for a comfortable, fruitful, or rational investigation?one cannot "get a wrench on it." (It is hard to investigate unconsumed burning bushes with attending sound effects since only one man experienced the phenomenon only once, at least as far as we know.) However, one might argue that if this "something," this MoreOther, is not in the cosmos, it might designate the activity of the cosmos as a whole, as if somehow the constituent parts of the universe conspired together to produce this most unusual occurrence. But we have no reason to believe that the cosmos acts as a whole; nothing in our experience warrants this belief. And granting a pluralistic cosmology such as Ferr?'s, we would find it improbable in the extreme. Further, if it is argued that somehow this event of presumed importance is the accidental collocation of cosmic elements, the effect of which is just this unusual and overwhelming experience, we could say that the experienced intentionality in the event (we are called, addressed, challenged, graced) is best interpreted as a gift of inestimable value and meaning purposely given. The best interpretive strategy is to argue that something experienced within the universe has the power?whether regularly, temporarily, or uniquely?to present to experience and to suggest for theory something not confinable within the universe and which "something" somehow simultaneously transcends and grounds the universe as a whole and each of its constituent parts?all facts, processes, possibilities, all dimensions, patterns, and norms. This grounding source is indeterminate in itself yet present in each determinate thing as the grantor of the reality of each thing. To that degree, the source is determinate and allows a characterization as the</page><page sequence="15">Vol. 23, No. 1, January 2002 27 maker of this here-and-now thing.25 Were the granting source not present, there would be nothing, sheer nothing, and, consequently, nothing to say. But there are things?a universe full of them. Thus the grantor of their reality is present and dynamically so. To summarize the first reason for urging upon Ferr? for a move in the direction of a theory of ontological creativity, such as I am briefly sketching here: the ecstatic experiences of numinosity, mystery, and the mystical harbor within themselves an intuition of a MoreOther that transcends the cosmos as the whole of determinate parts. Second, Ferr?'s notion of religious world model, which in both concept and application is one of his real contributions, receives a better housing on the theory of ontological creativity than on a naturalistic cosmology, such as Ferr? prefers. Why? It allows for a non-reductive explanation of the experiences of transcendence which the Western tradition acknowledges and cherishes, and it has the further virtue of making intelligible other types as well. My fear is that Ferr?'s PMPO requires that value intensively and comprehensively enjoyed, that is, religion, be interpreted as a matter of ontological immanence only. A metaphysical theory that would allow for the experienced paradox of radical ontological transcendence and radical ontological immanence is richer and hence is to be preferred. Third, I press some version of the theory of ontological creativity on Ferr? because I do not think that through his own approach he can account for why things are as they are. He can say that such-and such are the important things in the universe?process, growth, creativity, relation, organism, environmental context, freedom, beauty?and, frankly, I tend to agree. And the way he shows the interrelations among the important things is masterful. But I am not convinced that he can adequately say why they are together as they are and, further, why they are at all. Ferr? has challenged contemporary thinkers to re-vision the dominant Western religious world model in the light of the ecological and organismic insights now available. He has rightly assessed the 25 The agency implied in "making" is the warrant for using personal imagery to speak of this MoreOther, not that there is a cosmic person within the universe to which personal attributes might properly be applied?so the theory of ontological creativity would argue. Space does not allow further elaboration of this point; I mention it to indicate that there is an alternative to Ferr?'s theory, which purports to account for the things he would wish to explain through his personalism.</page><page sequence="16">28 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy cultural situation, has brought his considerable metaphysical expertise to bear on this noble but difficult task, and has produced a serious and sensitive solution. My counter-challenge is that he re-vision his theory to account better for experiences of ontological transcendence.</page></plain_text>
