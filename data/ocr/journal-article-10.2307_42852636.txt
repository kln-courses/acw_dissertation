<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brian Wynne, Rationality and Ritual: The Windscale Inquiry and Nuclear Decisions in Britain y Chalfont St. Giles: The British Society for the History of Science, 1982, 212 pp., £6.95. Wynne acknowledges in the preface to his book that this study has wider ambitions than the specific analysis of a particular decision, in this case, of the Windscale Inquiry which took place in 1977. This is important in two respects, firstly the Windscale Inquiry has already spawned a number of detailed analyses, and so Wynne must be careful to demonstrate the importance of his own particular contribution. Secondly, the public debate about nuclear energy matters continues to be re-focussed with the Sizewell Inquiry into the proposal to construct a Pressurised Water Nuclear Reactor in Suffolk now underway. To the extent that Wynne's book can offer something to our understanding of technological decision-making, then this book has added currency. Although a large part of the book is concerned with events at the Windscale Inquiry itself, it is perhaps more important to stress that Wynne introduces the following central themes. On the one hand, we are provided with a wealth of detail on the historical development of the nuclear debate in Britain, with some useful comparative material looking at decision- making through public inquiries in other substantive areas and different political contexts. On the other hand, Wynne develops the central thesis that the judicial rationality and legal ritual which holds sway at public inquiries does Violence to reality' (p. 121), largely by holding to the view 'that issues can be defined and resolved exclusively by reference to empirical facts' (p. 122) a position which Wynne unsurprisingly challenges. Following the Introduction, Wynne provides chapters which consider the history of commitment and determinism in the British nuclear programme; and the international political dimension to the proposal to build a nuclear waste reprocessing plant at Windscale. Here we are presented with further dëtailed evidence of the inherent contradictions and structural conflicts which have emerged in the British nuclear programme to date (although not necessarily expressed in those terms). Further contradictions are exposed in an ensuing chapter on the public inquiry. Central to the argument here are the difficulties produced by 'the widespread but mistaken idea that inquiries have full judicial status; pressure for inquiries to exhibit natural justice by examining policy which, although formally exempt, inhibits local participation; and the partisan role of government in being both promoter and judge, combined with growing administrative anatomy' (p. 72). Many of the objectors to the Sizewell B proposal will find much to empathise with here. Wynne then turns to a more substantive consideration of events at Windscale, and asserts his view that the decision on the proposal was in effect taken before the inquiry was constituted. But more than this, once under way, the</page><page sequence="2">SHORTER NOTICES 459 Windscale Inquiry, conducted according to the rules and expectations of judicial rationality and struck through with the 'ideology* of legalism, developed its own individual, independent momentum which nevertheless found in favour of nuclear industrial interests. Rationality and ritual therefore become the focus of Wynne's attention; he stresses the need for an anthropological approach to expose the ritualistic means by which legitimate authority is gained for technological commitments (which have already been made). This entails two difficulties which are by no means debilitating but which somehow work to frustrate the reader from making the connections which continually underpin Wynne's analysis. First, there is Wynne's approach to the institution of public decision-making which borders on the anthropomorphic, tending to disguise the political and temporal connections between those institutions and the state. Second, Wynne expressly avoids consideration of decision- making procedures at Windscale (although he has contributed in this area elsewhere), because 'procedural possibilities are inevitably restricted by the definition of the procedure itself and the limited level of discourse it can embody' (p. vii). Now, while supporting the contention that overt concern with procedural matters can militate against, and divert attention away from the real issues which are more worthy of analysis, it is nevertheless important to demonstrate the relationship between those very procedures and the continuing drive to obtain 'legitimate authority for technological commitments' - Wynne's central concern. Where this book does make an important and extremely topical contribution is in questioning the compatability between the nuclear industry and democratic life. Wynne provides a wealth of material which serves to expose some of the inherent conflicts between these two spheres, and an analysis such as this provides a fruitful insight into the ways in which those conflicts are played out. Wynne sets out to place the Inquiry in the context of thirty years of underdevelopment of democratic experience in handling nuclear technology (p. 13); his analysis should be of considerable interest to those who are still concerned with that continuing circumstance.
