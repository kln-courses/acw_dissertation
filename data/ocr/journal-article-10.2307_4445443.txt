<plain_text><page sequence="1">"INVITATIONS TO INQUIRY" AND TEACHER TRAINING It is generally recognized that traditional methods courses fail to develop the competencies required of today's science teacher. One basic assumption underly- ing recent suggestions for the preparation of science teachers is that "teaching is an interaction and . . . talking about teaching cannot be substituted for actu- ally doing it" (Williamson 1969). Another related as- sumption is "the greater the amount of direct active participation of teacher trainees in learning situations, the greater the degree of behavioral change" (Lee 1969). The purpose of this paper is to describe two dif- ferent activities based on these assumptions that have been used successfully for several years in the training of biology teachers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. A most important aspect of designing an activity- oriented course is the selection of instructional mate- rials. I have found the BSCS "invitations to inquiry" (see Schwab 1963) an excellent resource for biology 50 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, JANUARY 1976</page><page sequence="2">teacher training. Sixty invitations to inquiry are now available as either single-topic films or blackboard day- light projection slide sequences (BSCS). We find the audiovisual component adds a desirable dimension to the training experience. 1. Analysis of a lesson's objectives. Student teachers who participate in this activity are expected to be fa- miliar with Bloom's taxonomy of educational objec- tives (Bloom 1956) as well as the notion of inquiry skills. If this requirement is met, the activity offers a situation in which the participants may apply their abil- ity to identify and classify objectives. The same activ- vity, however, can be used with teachers who are not familiar with these topics. In this case, the analysis of the lesson will yield a novel list of objectives which may lead the students into the taxonomies of objectives. The single-concept super-8 film "Mimicry" (BSCS 1970) is particularly appropriate for this activity. This film presents the natural phenomenon of similarity in, appearance of taxonomically unrelated organisms. A series of experiments exploring the advantages of this similarity are demonstrated in the film, and the stu- dent is offered excellent opportunities for identifying problems, making observations, drawing conclusions, hypothesizing, identifying hypotheses, designing expe- riments, and so on. The activity consists of two parts. First, the instruc- tor presents the background and starts the film, delib- erately covering its title to maintain an open-ended situation. He then stops the film at various points to pose questions, such as those that follow: "Now that you have seen these pairs of unrelated organisms that are similar in appearance, what biological questions can you raise?" "If you were to conduct a laboratory investigation about this phenomenon (namely, simi- larity of appearance), what organisms would you use?" "Watch the following experiment and record your observations." "What question was studied by this biologist?" "What explanation can you offer for the way this animal behaved?" The students respond by writing their answers in their notebooks. However, at certain strategic points, such as after the last ques- tion cited above, the instructor asks the students to voice their answers. He writes all the explanations on the board and then, as a series of experiments is shown by the film, he asks the participants, "Which of the hypotheses may be eliminated on the basis of the fol- lowing experiment?" The first part of the activity takes about 45 minutes and is in itself an interesting and rewarding experience. However, the next section is the real focus of the whole activity. Now, the instructor suggests that the group examine what was required to answer each of the ques- tions posed during the showing of the film. Here the students may demonstrate their ability to analyze the questions and answers in terms of objectives and skills. This analysis often yields important implications. For example, in the first experiment shown on the film, a bumble bee tied to a string is given to a toad. The toad catches the bee, holds it in its mouth for a shdrt while, and then drops it. The students are asked, "What have you seen?" In the many times I have tried this, with such groups as high school students, student teachers, and even college professors, there have al- ways been some who answered: "A bumble bee was given to a toad, the toad caught it, then it was stung and let the bee go." Yet, the film does not show that. "It was stung" is not an observation but an inference. The difference between observation and inference is demonstrated so clearly that most remember it for a long time. In addition, anthropomorphic answers (such as "The toad first tried, but then had second thoughts") are usually offered by some participants and this issue may also be brought into the discussion. To facilitate the analysis, a work sheet with objec- tives already listed may be distributed so that the stu- dents can match each item with the related objective. 2. Microteaching. The use of "invitations to in- quiry" in microteaching provides a valuable teaching experience in which the student teachers are able to plan and prepare themselves with the aid of the teach- er's guide accompanying each invitation. In order to save time but also maintain the reality of a regular full-time lesson, each invitation to inquiry is prepared by three or four student teachers. The team has the opportunity to preview the film or slides and discuss among themselves the details. Then they divide the lesson into portions so that each has his own indi- vidual presentation. Our experience has shown that changing teachers in the middle of a lesson does not bother the participants. Each lesson is presented to a group of 8-15 students who volunteer to come in the afternoon. A group of high school students is invited twice or, at the most, three times, and then another group of a different kind of students (such as those of a different grade level or different socioeconomic status) is invited. At the end of the lesson the high school students are asked to make comments. Sometimes the instructor will ask them specific questions in order to illustrate specific points, such as the extent to which a certain concept, treated by the student teachers as if it were well known and understood, had actually not been understood. The whole procedure is videotaped and the tapes are viewed and analyzed either on the day of the presentation or during the following week. The analysis is not carried out within the context of prede- termined schemes of behavior. Rather, it is aimed at the application of psychological and didactic principles to specify situations within the actual setting. A stu- dent teacher may be asked to justify a particular line of activities, and then his classmates are free to criticize, to suggest other alternatives, and so on. At strategic points the instructor may stop the tape and ask some of the student teachers: "What would you do if you TEACHER TO TEACHER 51</page><page sequence="3">were the teacher?" Quite often hot debates arise in which different alternatives are suggested and defended. Because they are analyzing their own behavior, most student teachers find this activity highly interesting. When, at the end of the methods course they were asked to evaluate it, all the participating student teachers said they regarded the microteaching experience one of the highlights of their teacher training. In conclusion, we feel that these procedures make use of the most beneficial ingredients of teacher training: accurate feedback, self-confrontation, build- ing self-confidence, small scale teaching experiences without the risk of failure in the regular classroom, and providing the basis for weighing alternatives and conducting fruitful deliberations about actual teaching situations. It is too early to tell what will be the lasting effects of these teaching experiences. However, the feedback from the student teachers has been encouraging.
