Thomas School of Medicine, Wayne State University THE CEREBRAL CONCUSSION acceleration time tolerance curve due to frontal impact as described in SAE J885a is rec- ognized in vehicular dynamics circles in industry and govern- ment, both here and abroad, as the best head injury criterion presently available. Controversy exists about how to apply this information to complex head acceleration pulses experi- anced by anthropomorphic test devices. Gadd's empirical Severity Index (1)* was the first scheme devised and is the recommended practice in industry standards SAE J885a and government standard MVSS 208. Mathematically the Severity Index is defined as: I = /a2-5dt (1) where: a = acceleration 2.5 = a weighting factor chosen as the average ratio of time to acceleration over the time range of automotive interior head impacts for the tolerance curve on log-log plot t = time second *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. Integration of an acceleration time pulse experienced by a model of the human head is assumed critical if a numerical value greater than 1000 is accumulated. Recently two nearly identical mathematical displacement index models have been proposed. A model by Slattenschek and Tauffkirchen (2) was first proposed followed shortly by that of Brinn and Staffeldt (3). The models are both single degree of freedom, damped spring mass systems represented by second order differential equations, which are uniquely spe- cified by a natural frequency and damping factor. When the model is excited by an acceleration on its base, the response is the relative displacement between the base and the mass which compresses the spring and damper. The model is ad- justed to the tolerance curve by assuming a damping factor. Two simultaneous solutions of the differential equation can be obtained in response to triangular acceleration inputs taken from the curve, to yield a natural frequency and critical dis- placement. A best fit to the curve over the time range of interest is obtained by varying damping and natural frequency. Since the models are similar except for damping factor and natural frequency only the model by Brinn and Staffeldt called the Effective Displacement Index (EDI) will be discussed and compared to the Severity Index (SI). Because of the dearth of head injury tolerance information ABSTRACT Skull fracture was produced in forty cadavers which were dropped with their heads striking rigid, flat, hemispherical, and cylindrically shaped surfaces on the front, side, and rear. The heads were instrumented with biaxial accelerometers and force of impact was measured. Severity Index and Effective Dis- placement Index are compared at fracture level for all frontal impacts and the frontal flat plate results are compared to the Wayne State Cerebral Concussion Tolerance Curve. Indices calculated for Alderson 50th percentile dummy frontal head impacts onto a rigid flat plate are found to be higher than those for cadaver skull fracture impacts in the same drop height range. 2894</page><page sequence="2">available to be applied in practical design problems, that which is available has often been overextended. The curve is assumed to be valid for a very narrow range of conditions: frontal im- pact to a rigid flat surface, a-p acceleration pulses of a trian- gular shape, concussion. Effects of closely spaced multiple impacts, skull deforma- tion, rise time, reversing acceleration, and long duration accel- eration (0.010-0.050 s), some or all of which often accompany head injury accidents are little understood. The SI and EDI treat rise time, multiple pulses, low-level long duration, and fluctuating characteristics of an impact in a very dissimilar manner as has been thoroughly discussed in the 14th Stapp Conference Proceedings. It is because our knowledge of head injury mechanism is so imperfect that two such widely dif- ferent techniques could be applied to the same tolerance curve. Comparison of the SI and EDI is further complicated by the fact that human simulators differ in their response to impact because of stiffness and damping differences in comparison with the human. Consequently the SI and EDI will often differ widely in their interpretation of a pulse, in a large part because of the way they differ in the treatment of artifactual resonant frequencies which arise in dummy heads in degree depending upon the stiffness of the impact surface. The derivation of the Cerebral Concussion Tolerance Curve is discussed in detail in the 14th Stapp Conference Proceedings (4). Linear skull fracture in a cadaver is the condition from which the acceleration time data were obtained in the short duration end of the curve. Clinical statistics reveal that it is generally found to be true that a mild to moderate concus- sion accompanies a linear skull fracture in the human. Concus- sion has been noted to have occurred often without fracture. Consequently skull fracture is generally assumed to have oc- curred under more severe impact conditions than pure con- cussion alone. Many accidents which cause linear skull frac- ture result in a serious but not usually fatal injury. Consequently skull fracture represents a useful approxima- tion to concussion and an upper limit which should not be exceeded. In the present state of head injury knowledge, skull fracture data in the human cadaver probably represent the most reliable design guide available. It is for these reasons that the SI and EDI are compared for several conditions of frontal impact which produced linear fracture in a group of 20 cadavers. TEST PROCEDURE Embalmed moist human cadavers (Table 1) were strapped to a lightweight honeycomb aluminum pallet which was sup- ported by a pivot point at the feet (see Fig. 1). The cadavers were fitted with two pair of bi-axial accelerometers arranged as shown in Fig. 2, to record essentially transverse and a-p accelerations at two locations on the skull 3 in apart in a plane parallel to the sagittal plane of motion. Mounting, loca- tion, and orientation of the pickups were designed to be rela- tively free of skull vibrations to permit use of rigid body me- chanics in calculating translational and angular accelerations as well as the resultant linear acceleration of the head CG from the component measurements. Subminiature Endevco 2222-B accelerometers were glued to either aluminum posts or balsa wood mounts, which were in tum glued to the skull. The balsa wood mounts were the most accurate from the standpoint of positioning the accelerometers relative to each other and of dampening out vibrations, but neither mount was capable of filtering out all skull vibrations, particularly at skull fracture levels. Accelerometers were fed into Endevco 2702 dynamonitor amplifiers and the resultant amplified signal was recorded on Sp-300-C Ampex tape recorder and the signal was played back through a 1650 Hz galvanometer. The entire in- strumentation system was flat to 1000 Hz. Fig. 1 - Cadaver head drop test setup 2895</page><page sequence="3">2896 VOIGT R. HODGSON AND L. M. THOMAS The force of impact was recorded by a dynamically cali- brated four-arm strain gage load cell mounted under the im- pact surface, which included a flat plate, 8 in radius hemi- sphere, 3 in radius hemisphere, and 1 in radius cylinder aligned sagittally. The output of the load cell was fed to a Minneapolis-Honeywell Accudata II Carrier Amplifier and subsequent instrumentation as described above for the accelerometers. Velocity of impact was recorded by means of a probe alongside the head sweeping past two magnet pick-ups, mounted 3 in apart, just prior to impact of the head with the surface. The aim in most tests was to produce a threshold linear frac- ture in a minimum number of drops, preferrably one, because of the breakdown in the soft tissue. The cadaver head was raised to the desired height above the surface, the head was restrained by cord from rotating into its preferred position during free fall, and a solenoid quick release was activated. The event was timed to trigger a high-intensity xenon light source and a Hycam camera set at 4000 fps just prior to im- pact, so that motion of targets on the side of the head could be studied by means of a Vanguard Motion Analyser Model C-11D.

When a fracture was indi- cated by the records, a flap at the blow site was lifted back and a visual investigation and a photograph of the fracture, if any, was made. If no fracture was found, the flap was re- placed but shifted to apply relatively intact tissue to the blow o site, or a piece of 1/4 in thick, 1.98 lb/in dylite (5) was placed over the blow site if the soft tissue was irreparably damaged.

Force of impact and head acceleration were recorded for 5, 10, 15, and 20 in drop heights, which was the range which produced fracture in most of the cadavers. Other instrumenta- tion details in the dummy were the same as for the cadavers. RESULTS Anthropometry and vital statistics of the cadavers are listed in Table 1. Shown in the table is information from an addi- tional 20 cadavers which were not included in the frontal im- pact tests. Shown in Table 2 are the results of head impacts at fracture level against four surfaces beginning with the flat plate. The most comprehensive set of data is listed for this surface be- cause it is the condition upon which the concussion tolerance curve is based and because the most reliable measurements were obtained in the present series of tests for this surface. The drop height, velocity, and peak force are measured values. The peak value of the resultant CG accelerations (A^q) were calculated from the four measured acceleration components on the side of the head and distance measurements between pickups and CG using 1 to 1 photographic enlargements. The CG location was obtained by suspending the head from three different points in the sagittal plane in the usual manner of ob- taining body segment CG locations. The (effective) head Fig. 3 - Aiderson 50th percentile dummy forehead in flat plate impact attitude acceleration was obtained from integrating the resultant CG head acceleration and dividing this velocity change by the pulse duration, which is the time from initiation of accelera- tion to return to zero. The peak a-p acceleration (Aa_p) is the peak value of the measured acceleration of the a-p accelero- meter most remote from the blow site (Fig. 2). The SI (Açq) was computed from the calculated resultant CG acceleration (A^q). The SI (Aa_p) was calculated from the a-p acceleration measured by the pickup most remote from the impact site. The EDI (A^q) was the response calculated in inches using the resultant CG acceleration (A çq) as the excita- tion to the model. The EDI (Aa_p) is the response of the model due to excitation by the a-p acceleration measured by the a-p accelerometer most remote from the impact site. The average for all the measured and calculated impact param- eters for the front-flat plate condition are given in line 7 of Table 2. Fig. 4 shows a typical oscillogram record at fracture from which the measured and calculated values in Table 2 were obtained. Fig. 5 shows a typical linear fracture due to impact with this surface. The second condition shown in Table 2 is for the front -8 in radius hemisphere surface. As in the case of the front-flat plate condition, drop height, velocity, and peak force are measured values. Because of the skin-splitting effect of this surface and subsequent contact of bone with the surface, the oscillograph records at fracture level were too ragged to eval- uate by means of rigid body mechanics and consequently peak and mean CG acceleration were not calculated. The pulse time is the total duration from the initiation of the a-p accel- eration measurement until the acceleration subsides to zero. The SI and EDI were calculated only for the a-p acceleration for the pickup most remote from the impact site. Three out of of five cadavers received a linear fracture. Impacts to cadavers 1890 and 1906 produced circular localized fractures. The measured and calculated values for the front 3 in radius hemisphere impacts were obtained in a similar manner to the 8 in radius hemisphere impacts described above. A linear frac- ture was produced by impact against this surface for three of the cadavers. Cadaver 1961 suffered a severe compound frac- ture. Data for the front 1 in radius cylinder aligned with the sagittal plane was also obtained in a manner as described for the 8 in radius hemisphere impacts. Three cadavers received a linear fracture while cadavers 1876 and 1875 received a com- bination localized elliptically shaped fracture and linear frac- ture. Table 3 shows a comparison of the results for the front-flat plate impact condition in the cadaver as compared to the re- sults obtained for impact of the forehead of the 50th percen- tile Aiderson dummy against the flat plate. The drop height and peak force are measured values. The pulse time (Force) is the time from initiation of impact until the force again reaches zero. The peak acceleration resultant is the same as A^q for the cadaver as given in Table 2. For the dummy it is the vector sum of the a-p and transverse acceleration values.

The EDI was cal- culated for the a-p acceleration (Aa_p) for the pickup most remote from the blow site in the cadaver and for the a-p ac- celerometer in the dummy. Typical dummy response is shown by the oscillograph rec- ords in Fig. 6. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS The critical values of SI and EDI are 1000 and approx- imately 0.15 in (estimated from Fig. 3, Ref. 3) respectively, based upon a-p accelerations recorded for frontal impact to a rigid flat surface in the cadaver. For the SI under these conditions a range of values from 390-1800 was obtained with an average value of 780 (Table 2). The EDI ranged from 0.11-0.13 with an average value of 0.12. Since the MVSS 208 criterion for frontal compact is SI of 1000 for resultant accelerations, these values were also calculated to yield an SI range of 565-2020, average value 1150, and EDI range of 0.13-0.19, average value 0.16. It is to be expected that resultant values should be higher than a-p because the Fig. 5 - Linear fracture originating in right orbit due to frontal im- pact Fig. 4 - Typical expanded oscillographic record of force and acceleration at fracture</page><page sequence="7">2900 VOIGT R. HODGSON AND L. M. THOMAS resultant values include transverse as well as rotational accel- eration components (4). The six frontal rigid flat plate impacts have been plotted along with the Tolerance Curve in Fig. 7. Cadaver 1701, which produced the highest SI at fracture level, had the high- est acceleration for the shortest duration and therefore plots highest on the Tolerance Curve (point 3). Based on the values recorded for the other five it probably represents an atyp- ically stiff cadaver. The SI tends to accent these differences because of the exponential weighting factor, whereas the EDI, especially EDI (Aa-p) does not show a significant dif- ference among the six, all of which produced a linear frac- ture. For the other impact surfaces the SI and EDI are corn- Table 3 - Comparison of Alderson 50th Percentile Dummy to Cadaver Response at Fracture Level Front-Flat Plate Peak Pulse Time Pulse Time EDI Drop Ht., Force, (Force), Peak Accel, G (accel), Severity Index (A„ _) a-p Subject in. lb s res a-p s Ares* Aa-p Resp' in Cad 1747 10 1600 0.005 230 195 0.0076 794 400 0.11 Cad 1701 10 1450 0.0025 370 345 0.0045 2020 1800 0.12 Cad 1699 10 1700 0.0034 270 230 0.0076 1280 792 0.13 Cad 1805 10 1450 0.0064 190 150 0.0076 565 390 0.11 Cad 1873 25 2100 0.0056 240 195 0.0061 1020 724 0.13 Cad 1857 30 2000 0.0075 220 220 0.0076 1250 561 0.11 Average 14 1720 0.0051 250 220 0.0068 1150 780 0.12 Dummy 10 2350 0.0034 305 270 0.0072 1680 890 0.10 15 3070 0.0034 325 290 0.0072 2040 1150 0.12 20 4000 0.0028 425 384 0.0061 3270 2020 0.14 *Ares = Resultant of Aa_p and Atransverse measurements of dummy.

Convex surfaces tend to split the skin and cause surface-to-bone contact which excites bone resonances, making CG acceleration derivations by rigid body mechanics too inaccurate. The SI for the 3 and 8 in radius hemispheres were generally lower than for the flat plate, possibly because these surfaces produce higher localized stresses in the bone thus tending to cause bone failure before high accelerations can develop. The EDI showed little distinction between all the surfaces except for cadaver 1961. The SI was also low for this depressed fracture, which may have had atypically low strength. The tolerance curve on which the indices are based applies only to flat surface impact. However, the curved surface data are included because the effective area of impact can be more or less than a flat surface impact depending upon other things such as variation in skull shape and rigidity and skin thickness and consistency among cadavers. The 1 in radius cylinder was aligned with the sagittal plane, which is undergirded by a suture buttress. This may account for the higher forces and acceleration and therefore higher SI for this condition than fpr the other curved surfaces. It is interesting to compare the SI and EDI for 3 dummy drops of 10, 15, and 20 in. The peak a-p acceleration increased from 270 to 384, resulting in SI increase from 890 to 2020, whereas the EDI only went from 0.10 to 0.14. As can be seen by Fig. 6 the dummy head response to a rigid flat plate impact oscillates plus and minus. The SI treats the ab- solute value of the data because negative values of acceleration would lead to imaginary numbers when taken to a fractional exponent. Response of the EDI to alternating acceleration depends upon the algebraic sign of the data. Consequently, it is seen that both methods have mathematical peculiarities which operate on dummy response, which can be artifactual when compared to that of the more highly damped, less rigid human cadaver, to yield two very different pictures of impact severity. It is possible that impact against more re- silient surfaces would produce less skull vibrations in the dum- my, and better correlation between indices. However, this investigation was limited to rigid surfaces because of the con- venience with which fractures can be produced for this con- dition. CONCLUSIONS These test results confirm that frontal bone fracture oc- curs in the human cadaver at the same level of accelera- tion as predicted by the Wayne State University Tolerance Curve. Average values of SI and EDI computed for six impacts which produced linear skull fracture due to frontal rigid flat plate impact are in close agreement with critical values predicted by authors of these two methods. For the drop height range which produced linear fracture in the cadaver due to frontal impact against a rigid flat plate, the SI for the Alderson 50th percentile dummy head accel- eration response was much higher than for the cadaver. The EDI was essentially the same for both cadaver and dummy. At our present level of head injury knowledge, the results of these tests on cadavers and dummies are difficult to in- terpret in favor of either index.
