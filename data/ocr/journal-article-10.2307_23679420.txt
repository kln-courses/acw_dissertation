<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Iusnaturalism to Eunomics via Conativist Ethics BY LYNDALL LORNA TAMMELO, SALZBURG* In Remembrance of René Marcic This article rests on the hope that a modus vivendi between the proponents and opponents of natural-law thought is possible insofar as both are sober and con scientious thinkers alert to the responsibilities which englihtened men should have in our time. I propose here to outline some relevant thoughts towards the envisaged State of intellectual affairs and try to find a way out from the maze of quandaries in which the debate about natural law has been trapped. For termin ological convenience, I employ the word "iusnaturalism" for the set of ideas characterising natural-law thought. The term "legal positivism" labels the posi tion contraposed to this thought. The terms "eunomics" and "conativist", which may not be familiar to some scholars and which appear in the title of this article, will be explained when they are first used in the text that follows. I do not expect that in the near future either iusnaturalists or legal positivists would abandon their respective inclinations or stances. There appears to be a good chance, however, that the protagonists of both camps would corne to understand better their common problem-situation through that sort of attempt upon which I am embarking, and that thereby their talking at cross purposes would somewhat be reduced. I see a constructive mediational factor lying in the circumstance that most iusnaturalists and legal positivists are deeply concerned with good law. I shall try to show that an ethics which recognizes the role of rationality in acts involving will is instrumental in the modus vivendi I have in mind. I proceed from the assumption that neither legal positivists nor iusnaturalists who are to be taken seriously are "bad men", that is, those who desire evil for evil's sake. There are those among them, of course, who are misguided or con fused in their ethical reasoning, which is likely to happen when they are espous ing extremist views. In the contemporary debate, there seem to be very few in deed who actually indulge in these, but in the heat of controversy the proponents of one of the contraposed positions often suspect that their opponents are guilty of expressing ideas which lead to disastrous legal or political conséquences. I am most unimpressed, even appalled, by the opinion occasionally voiced by eminent scholars that legal positivism as such is to be blamed for horrors of totalitarian régimes. If one wants to be nasty, the reversed accusation can be made, because * I am indebted to my husband limar Tammeio, whose works and personal advice have given me guidance in writing this article. I have derived stimulus also from personal discussions with René Marcic in 1971 before his tragic death, who during his visit to the University of Sydney was deeply concerned about the non-meeting of mind of iusnatural ists and legal positivists and was working towards a modus vivendi between them for a fruitful discussion of both about issues of good law.</page><page sequence="2">From Iusnaturalism to Eunomics via Conativist Ethics 93 iusnaturalist ideology, too, contains elements capable of being perverted which political totalitarianism has utilized to provide "rationalizations" for their evil practices. Furthermore, a typical iusnaturalist charge according to which legal positivists opine that law can be so completely reduced to the command of the sovereign power that right is exclusively determined by might, actually has its target in the iusnaturalist own camp. Certainly, legal positivists believe that a sovereign legal command can give rise to legal rights, but not to "right" in any ultímate or in an elevated moral sense. The claim that a sovereign command gives rise to what is unquestionably right or what men ought ultimately to do is a version not of legal positivism but of iusnaturalism, namely of the one which is excessively orientated to the value of security and unduely relies on the power fact in society. It is most unfortunate that in some disputes between iusnatura lism and legal positivism the parties to the controversy charge the opponents with views not held by these or held only by extremists or perversionists in both camps, who by no means represent the real message of either school of thought. Both iusnaturalism and legal positivism have numerous varieties which make it difficult to see that for what those who regard themselves or who are regarded as advocates of one of the contending positions basically stand. In order to carry the présent undertaking further, it is therefore necessary to attempt a détermina tion of what should be considered essential in iusnaturalism and in legal positivism and of what should be considered merely accidentai or contingent in them. I regard as the central thesis of legal positivism and its décisive characteristic that the validity of law is exclusively determined by certain identifiable facts, namely by law-creative acts leading to constitutional or legislative enactments, authoritative judicial précédents, or customary-law formations. As the central thesis and as the décisive characteristic of iusnaturalism, I regard the one accord ing to which the validity of law is also determined by its contentual correspon dence to certain unrenounceable standards of human behaviour such as those forbidding wanton killing, arbitrary and outrageous discrimination, and inhuman punishments. With the central thesis of legal positivism it is quite consistent to believe — as many professed legal positivists do - that law actually has an "inner morality" providing for at least elementary protection to human life, for consis tency in the application of law, for promulgation of law, and for a modicum of decent judicial behaviour - without which no legal system can survive. On the other hand, with the central thesis of iusnaturalism it is quite consistent to acknowledge - as many professed iusnaturalists do - the great significance of law-creative acts in the legal enterprise, and not to expect every valid legal norm to embody the highest standards of natural-law thought. Essential for legal positivism is that law, without being deprived of its validity, can be morally répugnant. But this does not prevent it from being recognized as legally valid} the moral judgment about law and an appropriate action against it, even rébellion, isleftopen tothe individuáis orgroups concerned. Legal positivism as such does not assert that law as it exists provides an answer to the question as to what a person ought ultimately to do. Essential for iusnaturalism is that law</page><page sequence="3">94 Lyndall Loma Tammelo cannot be outrageously immoral; it can tolérate only a certain amount of moral flaws - those which cannot readily be remedied in our imperfect world without unduely disturbing an orderly administration of law. Neither legal positivists nor iusnaturalists believe that law exists in complete séparation from morality : moral elements are inextricably interwoven in the texture of any legal system. Legal positivists, however, insist that law and moráis are distinct entities. This is what few iusnaturalists deny. Legal positivism is contingently connected with the extremist views that ra tional justification of moral standards bearing on law is impossible, that legal systems are self-sufficient providing solutions for any case, and that law contains only those norms which are explicitly stated in the sources of law. Iusnaturalism is contingently connected with the extremist views that unjust law is not law, that there is a universal duty to resist those laws which are inconsistent with natural law, and that natural law exercises a derogatory force upon positive law invalidating any of its otherwise valid norm. There are professed legal positivists who subscribe to principies such as "Ultra posse nemo obligatur" and "What is legally not prohibited is legally permitted". These views import an undue conces sion to iusnaturalism and amount to cryptic iusnaturalism. On the other hand, there are professed iusnaturalists contending that natural law can exist only in the guise of positivization and there is ng natural law transcending positive law. Here we find an undue concession to legal positivism and a cryptic legal positivism. Some iusnaturalists take the view that natural law can have variable content: its principies can change in historical situations. This conception does not appear to be inconsistent with the basic ideas of iusnaturalism. If we consider the essential positions of iusnaturalism and of legal positivism, it appears that they are both "intrinsically" plausible, even reasonable, seen as alternative approaches to the same problems confronting lawyers and Citizens in general. They involve, however, différent Organization of relevant ideas and entail différent stratégies and tactics in dealing with legal and social realities. On the level of legal philosophy, it is not possible to judge their "extrinsic" merits. Fundamental thought does have an actual impact on mastering our life. But what this impact exactly is cannot be explored and ascertained without appro priate empirical research. For philosophical inquiry there is still the task to sort out and to arrange the fundamental ideas involved. In the following, I shall venture some steps in that direction. To find a foothold for these steps, it is necessary to consider important mani festations of iusnaturalism in the history of ideas. There are three main types of natural-lawconceptions: the theonomic, the anthroponomic, and the ontonomic. According to the theonomic conception, the origin of natural law lies in the divine reason or will announced in the révélations expressed in holy scriptures or in oral religious tradition. This conception involves divine enactments; thus theonomic natural law proves actually to be divine positive law. No divine autho rity claimed to lie behind particular expressions of this law can count upon uni versal acceptance, for there are multiple and multifarious religious views, ail involving irrational elements, and there is the corresponding plurality of unde</page><page sequence="4">From Iusnaturalism to Eunomics via Conativist Ethics 95 cidable Claims to divine authority. Since natural-law ideas are asserted to have universal tenability, it is better to steer clear from religious ideas employed for backing natural law. It is to be left to the individuáis concerned to seek this additional backing or to renounce it altogether. The anthroponomic conception of natural law seeks the grounding of this law in what is called "human nature". This is made up by certain basic biological, psychological, and intellectual traits of man. traits which law has to take into account. These traits are supposed to be firmly established or subject only to small modifications. An objection which this conception raises is that even those traits do not always provide a foundation for a law that should be regarded as good or as deserving observance. On the contrary, law and moráis have some times the task of suppressing or transcending man as he actually is. A legal or moral thinker should never be oblivious of the dismal side of human actuality. There is a wide scope for empirical research to ascertain what human nature really is and for legal and moral efforts to deal with it appropriately. The ontonomic conception of natural law seeks the grounding of this law in the "nature of things", proceeding from the assumption that the realities con fronting the legal or moral reasoner carry indications to appropriate régulations in themselves. Thus for this view the whole world appears, as it were, to be a "cryptogram" of a natural-law code. An objection to this conception is that there is no way of correct deciphering of such a cryptogram, even if it can be assumed that "things" as such contain regulatory elements - a rather anthropomorphic assumption ill-fitted to contemporary learning. There is even a more fundamen tal objection to the ontonomic conception of natural law, which resides in the "Humean Guillotine", according to which it is logically impossible to derive value judgments or norms from Statements of mere facts. This objection is irre futable, because logical inferences perform only a transformation of what is contained in the premisses (in the présent case, the Statements of fact) combined with laws of logic; it does not perform a transmutation of the basis of inferences" by bringing into their conclusions what is not included in their premisses. The same objection applies to the anthroponomic conception of natural law, for this conception, too, opérâtes on certain facts, namely on actual traits of men. Since the three types of traditional natural-law conceptions appear to be untenable, the question arises as to whether the whole body of natural-law thought is unsound. Is it really an "elegy of folly"? — to use a contemptuous phrase in which hostility to iusnaturalism has found a colourful expression. I do not propose to jump to that conclusion and in the sequel I shall consider a way in which natural-law thought can be regarded as intellectually respectable even from the watchtower of contemporary censorious learning. Before proceed ing to that, a challenge should be met which has been made by some opponents of iusnaturalism. They point out that no concept of law can be framed in dis missal of the fact that positive law belongs to the denotation of this concept. Natural law, however, consisting in ideal standards of behaviour can be accom modated in the concept of law as little as imagined or imaginable money can be accommodated in the concept of money being in actual currency. This challenge</page><page sequence="5">96 Lyndall Lorna Tammelo can be refuted by the considération that even if natural law is nothing eise but a set of ideas or ideáis, it is possible to frame a concept of law in general which embraces potential as well as actual, désirable as well as real law. Moreover, natural-law ideas or ideáis do not lack material embodiments, these being consti tuted by its numerous treatises, déclarations, and even in its codifications. The latter at least are no less material than the Roman law expressions are in our time. Thus positive as well as natural law can be conceived as species of law in general; they are characterized by certain abstract (structural) features of the phenomenon of law, however manifested. The term "natural law" has become firmly established in the history of ideas carrying positively tinged connotations for the proponents and negatively tinged connotations for the opponents of iusnaturalism. A detached observer may query whether the term "natural law" is semantically appropriate for conveying that which is sound in natural-law thought. In general usage, "nature" means a kind of factuality and "natural" means what pertains to this factuality. Since nature in this sense can be good as well as bad and since from pure fact statements no value judgments or norms can be derived, "natural law" appears to be a mislead ing term if general usage is to guide our understanding of natural law. The term can have, however, an acceptable meaning in a special usage, according to which "nature" refers to an ideal State of affairs, to something as it ought to be. "Nat ure" in this sense is a factuality onto which values or norms are projected; accordingly the nature of which iusnaturalists speak is to be regarded as consist ing in fact-value or fact-norm complexes constituting "entia moralia". The endowment of meaning involved here may still suit many legal or moral thinkers, but it irritâtes others as a gratuitous diversion from general usage. Since, normal ly, both the proponents and opponents of iusnaturalism are concerned with good law, it should promote their sober discussion of common problems if the concern with good law would be referred to by a neutral term, for which I pro pose "eunomics". To justify eunomic statements and thus to found their tenability, mere Cog nition is obviously not sufficient. In order to achieve this aim, there is required at least "re-cognition" of what has been attributed to the relevant facts so that they may be endowed with the quality of goodness. A purely cognitive eunomics has henee a poor chance to be regarded as respectable in contemporary learning, whereas a re-cognitive eunomics has a good chance. The fear that something precious gets lost for natural-law thought through re-cognitive eunomics is unwarranted. An excessive emotional attachment to truth as a value linked with Cognition is unreasonable. For truth in non-trivial matters is not readily available in any human pursuit and it is not the only value to guide our actions. Rational enterprise is governed also by other fundamental values such as goodness, right ness, beauty, and charity, which conjointly exercise a "condominium" over our civilized life. It is important that we let ourselves be guided by ail of them, mak ing adjustments as to the pertinent considérations, and that we find ways and means for being rational in this activity. I believe that the practical reason in volved in it has no inferior status as against theoretical reason, and that in both</page><page sequence="6">From Iusnaturalism to Eunomics via Conativist Ethics 97 areas we can achieve basic insights and certitude about the tenability of funda mental principies capturing these insights. The caveat of our fallibility in theore tical as well as in practical pursuits is to be heeded when we claim something to be true as well as when we claim something to be good, right, etc. Even the theonomic, anthroponomic, and ontonomic conceptions of natural law do not escape from the fact that a volitional, résolutive, or - to use a technical term - conative element is attached to them. There must be a will to accept the authority claimed to be divine, a will to regard certain traits of man as being a basis for standards ofbehaviour,anda will to accept certain features of the world confronting us as being of regulative significance. This will, conatus, imports an attribution of a value, oran Ought-element to the relevant facts or to the relevant "Is". What by a queer metaphor has been called a "gulf" or "chasm" between the realms of the Is and the Ought is "bridgeable". The ontological différence between both realms allows a "traffic" between them by acts which endow facts with values or treat an Is-instance as Ought-relevant. The conative acts involved must be rational, of course, for ethical enterprise. These considérations lead to a conativist ethics and eunomics. The conativist position I am trying to render plausible has a relationship to the non-cognitivist position in ethics, but I have qualms about the term "non-cognitivism" for the présent purposes and take a distance from some varieties of non-cognitivist ideology. The particle "non" here tends to convey a déniai of the significance of Cognition in practical reason; thus,indeed,non-cognitivism in ethics has for one of its varieties ethical emotion alism amounting in its extremist form to irrationalism, according to which, for example, invocation of justice in legal, moral, or political issues is nothing eise but "banging on the table" (which often it undoubtedly is, but which need not be that). Conativism insists on the presence of conative, that is, the will- or resolutional elements in ail ethical principies or judgments, but it also insists on the importance of cognitive elements in the same. Thus it imports a "synoptic" view of the totality of matters which concern ethical reasoners — the fact- and the value-, the Is- and the Ought-components of this totality. Ethical conativism does not ignore that the laws of nature set limits to legal or moral action, nor does it ignore that certain facts are suitable for desired or désirable results and that certain values or norms are "fïtting" in order to deal with given fact-situa tions. A conativist eunomics in displaying practical reason is reliant on the theory of argumentation. The aim of this theory is not just the achievement of assent in "universal audience" by arguments which prove to be "strong" in this audience. Thus it ought not to be conceived as perductive (what characteristically any sales talk is that succeeds in persuading a client to buy); it ought to be conceived as euductive in that it leads to insightful assent in a forum of reason constituted in the given argumentative situations by compétent and open-minded men having moral and intellectual integrity. We possess a great deal of valuable experience gained in legal, moral, and scientific encounters for working out the rules which would guide us in the constitution of a forum of reason and in efforts to achieve insightful assent. The theory of argumentation I have in view is not a special</page><page sequence="7">98 Lyndall Loma Tammelo kind of logic, a logic of humanities. It is rather a kind of normative ethics provid ing rules of behaviour for an essential area of activity of civilized men. It requires inter alia observance of the laws of logic, the respect for which is a command of practical reason, but substantially it transcends logic strictly so-called by em bodying principies and methods of ethical import. The conativist eunomics I have in mind appears to be consistent with the best tradition of antique, mediaeval, and modern natural-law thought. It does not seem to detract anything from what has been valuable for iusnaturalists. At the same time, it should be consonant with the basic ideas of those legal positivists who are men of good intentions. The différence between iusnaturalists and legal positivists will remain, occasioned by their particular approaches to the same phenomenon and tasks and by their consequential stratégies and tactics to be employed for achieving good law and a good administration of law. Conativist eunomics can establish a modus vivendi between them containing salutary ten sions of thought in debates, from which solutions acceptable to both iusnatura lists and legal positivists may emerge - solutions reached in a différent way and justified by arguments which may suit each the best. For example, iusnaturalists may invoke the derogatory force of natural law in relation to outrageously unjust laws, but legal positivsts may prefer the device of rétroactive law for dealing with the same legal problem. The open texture of law and the leeways available to judges in the application of laws gives an ample discretionary scope for acting on eunomic considérations, whether by invocation of certain unrenounceable Standards of behaviour or by open euductive délibérations on facts and values involved in the given situation. I expect both iusnaturalists and legal positivists who would run the modus vivendi to which conativist eunomics can lead to be conscientious men. An ultí mate instance to which eunomics may appeal is conscience. However, the con science appealed to cannot be that which an individual simply expériences as his conscience. For this experience, too, can be fallible; it can be misguided, even deleted and corrupted. The conscience eunomically significant can only be en lightened conscience; its enlightenment can be from time to time achieved in concrete euductive argumentative situations. Our time requires a new enlighten ment to be promoted by close philosophical and scientific attention to great contemporary problems of humanity requiring a re-thinking and even at times an overhaul of several convictions which have so far guided human pursuits. I do not think that iusnaturalists can achieve much by simply insisting that there is natural law superior to positive law and that natural law has a derogatory force upon positive law. The iusnaturalist cause would be much better served by insisting that essential results of eunomic reasoning ought to be treated as stand ards for legislative, judicial, or administrative action, where ever feasible and that positive law at the points where it is répugnant to these standards ought to be repealed, interpreted according to them, or in extreme cases unremediable in the legal process resisted or even rebelled against. The best chance for natural-law ideas and ideáis to be materialized lies in the de lege ferenda action, by which suprapositive postulâtes of practical reason become positivized. On the other</page><page sequence="8">Front lusnaturalism to Eunomics via Conativist Ethics 99 hand, I do not think that legal positivists can achieve much by scoffing at the natural-law thought. Their good causes would be much better promoted by accommodating iusnaturalist standards deserving acceptance in their eunomic legal reasoning and acting on them in legislative, judicial, or administrative mea sures, wherever feasible.</page></plain_text>
