<plain_text><page sequence="1">Trees of Life and Trees of Death in China The Magical Quality of Trees in a Deforested Country Von Silvia Freiin Ebner von Eschenbach, Würzburg In China almost all virgin forests were cut down centuries ago, except in certain peripheral areas of Northeast and Southwest China and Tibet where minority people still preserve their natural forests. But even there, most of the virgin forests were destroyed as soon as the Chinese entered the region. If a conservation of forests was practiced at all, the foremost policy was to reduce deforestation and not to encourage reforestation. State support was limited to the selective planting of trees considered useful for intensive ag- riculture rather than for extensive forestry, a practice unheard of in China. Trees were also planted as a protection for roads and highways, for strategic reasons and as a natural barrier against floods. In scholarly gardens their use was a purely esthetic one, as may be seen in numerous paintings.1 In 1930 W. G. Lowdermilk commented on the denuded North China Plain, with a few scattered nurseries amidst the agricultural area: "It is true that no forests are to be found in this plain, but each village has its trees, which are grown according to a system. Nurseries dating back to ancient times are still in existence to supply seedlings and cuttings for planting."2 One might think that Chinese civilization is quite indifferent towards tree planting. Yet, since ancient times trees were considered sacred or sacrosanct, and were preserved as single old and big trees or in groves around temples and shrines. How to explain the apparent discrepancy between Chinese tree- veneration and their casual attitude towards forest preservation? As Wolf- ram Eberhard and Yu Chien emphasize, the tree cults of the present do not necessarily stem from ancient cults, but may be connected with them in some aspects.3 1 Daniels/Menzies 1996, pp. 658-662; Schafer 1962, pp. 291, 300; Tuan 1970, pp. 34-35, referring to Richardson 1966, pp. 151-153.

On his travels through the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Shanxi and Shenxi in 1907, Édouard Chavannes observed big trees overladen with ribbons of red cloth bearing the names of their devotees written in black characters. Still today houses in country villages are often built around a tree as their center. In 1927 during his field survey in the Ding county of the Province of Hebei, Sidney Gamble witnessed people hanging cloth scrolls on trees. In the years 1924, 1925, and 1935 when he traveled in the province of Si- chuan, David Graham noticed the worship of old trees, such as cedars, ban- yans (ficus retusa' cypresses or pines. In Hongkong in the early 1950s, Ru- dolphe Burkhardt observed old trees that were lavishly decorated. On his field trip in 1934-1935, Eberhard described the veneration of camphor trees and their worship as Earth Gods, a phenomenon peculiar to the prov- ince of Zhejiang which is still preserved to this day. Florian C. Reiter describes extensively the adoration of an old tree that he witnessed on his stay in the province of Sichuan in 1989. In the years 1992-1994, Yu Chien carried out field research on tree cults in Taiwan.4 According to Eberhard, the tree cult is a special form of the cult of the Earth God.5 Our knowledge of the Earth God (7i¿ i) dates back to bone inscriptions of the Shang Dynasty (16th- 11th cent. bc). As a god of nature, the Earth God was held responsible for rain, flood, wind and the harvest. As early as the Zhou Dynasty (1045-221 bc) and the Han Dynasty (206 bc to ad 220), trees were considered as markers of sacred places.6 As we know from the Baihu tong [The Comprehensive Discussions in the White Tiger Hall], trees made it possible for people to see a sacred place from afar. Fur- thermore, trees showed the presence of the respective god residing there: "Why is there a tree on the altar of the Gods of the Earth and of the Millet? That it may [thereby] be honored and recognized. [Thus] people may see it from afar and worship it."7 4 Photography of a sacred tree in Shanxi province (Chavannes 1909, fig. no. 1159); Chavannes 1910, p. 471; Gamble 1954, pp. 412-413; Graham 1961, pp. 113-114; Graham 1936, pp. 59-61 and Burkhardt 1953-58, vol. 1, p. 122, vol. 2, p. 119, 151, quoted after Yu 1997, chap. 2, pp. 5, 8; Eberhard 1968, pp. 174-175; Eberhard 1970, pp. 21-22 with fig. 1 on d. 22; Reiter 1992, p ass.: Yu 1997, chap. 3 et pass. 5 Eberhard 1968, p. 174. 6 Berger 1980, p. 88. 7 Ban Gu (ad 32-92), Baihu tong (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju 1994), j. 3, p. 89, line 14 (translation from Tjan 1949-52, vol. 2, p. 384); Berger 1980, p. 89.</page><page sequence="3">Trees of Life and Trees of Death in China 373 During the Zhou Dynasty, the single Earth God (Tu) of the Shang seems to have been replaced by a plurality of gods of the soil (she with their re- spective territories. 8 The Earth God came to be organized according to the hi- erarchy of human groupings and territorial administration.9 In the Chunqiu period (770-476 bc) every city state had its own Earth God.10 Later on, even each quarter of the city and each village in the country, each field and grave adored its own genius loci}1 During the dynasties of the Song (960-1279), Ming (1368-1644), and Qing (1644-1911), the cult of the Earth God became more and more an integral part of the local hierarchies, defying control by the central administration of the state.12 Kanai Noriyuki makes a distinction between the formalized official cult practiced at the imperial, provincial and district levels and the archaic cult still found in village communities.13 Ideally, four trees were to be planted on four sides of a square used as an imperial altar for the Earth God. Four regional altars stood in the center of the four divisions of the imperial territory. The Shang shu tells us what kind of tree may be used: for the great altar with a single tree one should plant a pine tree (song fa). On the altar with the four directional trees, a thuja or cypress (bo ^â) should stand for the Earth God of the east, a catalpa (zi #) for the Earth God of the south, a chestnut tree (li Ķ) for the Earth God of the west and an sophora (huai $L) for the Earth God of the north.14 Each altar consisted of a mound or an artificial heap of earth with the respective tree planted on top. Without an altar, a natural grove (cong jļSt) or a very huge tree served the purpose. It was believed that the largest tree amidst or in the near surroundings of a village was the place where the local Earth God resided. Chavannes assumes that originally the Earth God was thought to be identical with a grove of trees. As he points out, it seems quite convincing that the artificially planted single tree evolved from the natural grove and that in the course of time veneration of a grove was reduced to veneration of one single tree during the Han Dynasty.15 8 Chang 1970, pp. 192-193, 195. 9 Chavannes 1910, pp. 437-450. 1U Chang 1970, p. 195. 11 Lagerwey 1991, p. 26. 12 For the organization of the cult of the Earth God during the Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties v.

Trees condensed the God's chthonic ener- gies into a personalized form. The Baihu tong says that the reason why the Earth God's altar (she) has no roof, is because the tree should stay in con- tact with the vital energy (qi) of heaven and earth.17 By ad 500 the tree cult as a symbol of the Earth God seemed to have been so neglected that a peti- tioner handed in a memorandum to remind the Emperor that trees ought to be planted on the altars for the Earth God.18 This complaint recurs often among Song Neo-Confucians who like Hu Bingwen fà X (1250-1333) and Liu Kezhuang f'J &amp; 3* (1187-1269) pleaded that people should return to the ways of the ancients and plant a tree upon the Earth God's mound instead of building a shrine with a roof on top of the altar.19 According to Chavannes, the Earth God was also represented (xiang Ķ , 4Ķ) as a statue (zhu i), originally made of clay (tu ouren A ^ A), stone or wood and later on exclusively of stone. The Earth God was thought to take residence in this statue.20 Eduard Erkes follows Chavannes' idea propos- ing that the statue itself had developed from the tree.21 According to the Tuo zhuan [Tradition of Master Zuo], the Earth God's statue (she) was carried by a priest accompanying a military campaign.22 From texts telling that "the ruler took the Earth God (she) with him in his arm" and that "on military campaigns the Earth God (she) was transported on a war chariot", Clau- dius Müller concludes that the Earth God (she) may have manifested him- self in a wooden stele or stone slab.23 This custom was paralleled by carrying the corpse of a king or a wooden statue representing the dead king into the battlefield, as the corpse or statue was believed to contain vital energy that ensured a victory.24 16 Huangdi zhaijing (Yimen guangdu, ed. in: Baibu congshu),/.

Kanai proved that shamanic practices were common from the Tang Dynasty (618-907) onwards and human-like images of the Earth God were widely used during the Song Dynasty. Ritual purists among the Song Neo-Confucians like Liu Kezhuang (1187-1269) complained of the anthro- pomorphization of the Earth God.25 The Song Neo-Confucian Hu Bing- wen (1250-1333) remarks: "Nowadays, in the she altars of the common people, they usu- ally paint things inside the room of a house. [...] They paint an old white-haired man with long eyebrows, and reverently refer to him as the Duke of the She Altar of the Soil (Shegong ^). More- over, they provide him with an old wife. All this is absolutely not in accordance with the an- cient ways."26 According to a local gazetteer from the Fujian province, it was still common during the Ming Dy- nasty to carry statutes of the Earth God (shezhu í) around in a procession.27 Nowadays the Earth God is venerated as an old man (called Tudi gong Ì &amp; '£ in South- ern China, resp. Tudi laoye A ij¡r in Northern China). In ur- ban quarters he is housed in small temples. But in the countryside he is still represented by a stone on a Fig. 1: Tree representing the Earth God in an urban quarter of the 20th century China, photography (Lagerwey 1991, fig. 20 on p. 30) 24 Shiji (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1959),;. 4, p. 120, line 5 (translated in Chavannes 1895-1905, vol. 1, p. 224); cp.

Originally the ancestral tablet ( shenzhu # A) seen as the permanent residence of the ancestor's soul was a human-shaped statue of the ancestor. Ancestral images (xiang, also called ying made of clay or wood were common during the Song Dynasty. Ancestral statues continued to be used in some parts of China until recent times. In the Fujian province ancestral images were still in use as late as the 17th century. Again, Song Neo- Confucian fundamentalists propagated what they believed were the ideals of the ancients and pleaded for steles ( zhu A) or boards (ban fe).29 One may, however, take into consideration a hypothesis about the origin of the zhu jL postulated by Hayashi Minao. According to Hayashi, the prototype of the zhu jL is to be found in neolithic Liangzhu jade cylindri- cal objects (cong *&amp;). He believes that neolithic jade cylinders were origi- nally not called cong but zhu A ("hosts") in the sense of the meaning to invite the gods or ancestral souls to take residence in a jade cylinder as their lodging place [fig. 2]. With the beginning of the Zhou dynasty, a zhu jL was made of wood as it says in the Gongyang commentary to the Chun- qiu [Spring and Autumn Annals].

Its form is four- square, with a hollowed-out center which may be reached on all four sides. Hayashi therefore sug- gests that during the Han Dynasty the Altar of the Earth God was a square platform with a circular aper- ture in the center.30 The neolithic jade cylinders (cong 3$) are engraved with masks or else with a man wearing a mask, probably a tattooed shaman. The headgear of such a mask was interpreted as a plume of feathers.31 Hayashi, how- ever, shows that there are also masks with a tree rising from the top of the mask and interprets the mask as the head of the god residing in the cylin- der. Tree masks may be recognized on a rubbing of a stamped tile from a Han tomb at Zhengzhou in the Henan province or on the rubbings of eaves tiles of the Zhanguo period (475-221 bc) from Biyang in the Henan prov- ince. As a consequence of Hayashi s reasoning, Alexander Soper asks: "[...] may it not have been possible that there was also some neolithic equivalent of the later central tree, perhaps a cer- emonial bunch of grasses inserted into the central channel [of the cong *£]?" This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that many cong 3$ are wider at the top and at the bottom than they are inside the cylinder, like a vase.32 The altar of the Earth God was the place from which any demonstration of power started and ended.

As late as in the Ming state ritual, it was at the Earth God's altar that oaths were taken. It was the place where the feudal lords held great assemblies and imposed punishments and where wars against animals or humans, i.e. hunting expeditions and military campaigns started. Hunters sacrificed their game at the altar. War prisoners and political opponents were presented at the Earth God's altar and some- times sacrificed there. The Earth God was the only god to be offered noth- ing but raw meat {xueshi jfe and whose statue or tablet was smeared with blood. Marcel Granet suggests that, originally, trophies of the victims were hung on the Earth God's tablet.

Ha- yashi had his own theory about the meaning of the wuzhu- coins. The wuzhu- coins being of trifling value, he believes that the word wuzhu _£ #. is a mere pun for the term wushou 4r ("my longevity"), similar to the providential phrase inscribed in Han bronze mirrors "May your longevity be like metal or stone".36 A money tree base from Xinjin in Sichuan shows people carrying poles across their shoul- ders hung with wuzhu-coins. Money tree bases from Pengshan and Santai in the Sichuan prov- ince show people taking coins off trees where coins are arranged in a way inspired from the molds for casting coins.37 Their mount-like base reminds of the lid of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 8) boshan lu- censers (I# ih Jāt).38 One example for the money tree of the East- ern Han Dynasty (ad 25-220) is a bronze tree standing on a clay mountain-like pedestal, 105 centimeters high. It was excavated from a rock tomb in Pengshan district in the Sichuan prov- ince in 1972 [fig. 3].

It is only from a Qing Dynasty description of the New Year's Festival (Yanjing suishi ji) that we know about the custom of shaking coins from so- called "money trees" (qianshu ^ or "trees from which one can shake money" ( yaoqian shu M MM)- 42 In the description it says: "Take a big twig of the pine or the cypress, stick it into a vase and hang old copper coins, gold or silver money on it [. . .]."43 Eastern Han money trees seem to stem from cosmic world trees of the Shang Dynasty. Fragments of bronze trees from the Shang Dynasty were excavated in 1986 in Sanxingdui near Guanghan which belongs to the dis- trict of Pengshan district in the province of Sichuan. As far as the trees could be reconstructed, they were found to have had a height of about 1 to 4,2 meters with a mountain-like base. Erickson and also Zhao Dianzeng sug- gest that they were intended as passage ways from earth to heaven as axis mundi tied between the mundane and the spiritual world, the ascent of the tree leading to immortality. This concept corresponds to the tree seen as an axis mundi , as it was analyzed by Mircea Eliade who takes a comparative intercultural view.44 In the opinion of Eberhard, the tree cult as part of the cult for the Earth God is a fertility cult.45 The idea that the sacred tree in China symbolized a divine phallus was first introduced by Bernhard Karlgren and restated by Erkes.46 Karlgren's interpretation was criticized as an exaggeration by 40 Erickson 1994, pp. 22-23 with fig. 1 on p. 47 and fig. 29 on p. 76; Anonymous 1962, fig. 6.1 on p. 398; Xiong 1979, fig. 15.9 on p. 30; He 1991, fig. 29.2 on p. 17 and fig. 30.2 on p. 18; Shanhai jinç, "Xishan jine" (translated in Cheng/Pai Cheng/Thern 1985, p. 24). 41 Hayashi 1990, p. 11. 42 Erickson 1994, p. 7; Wiedehage 1995, p. 368a-b. 43 Du Lichen (1855-1911), Yanjing suishi ji [Annual Customs of Beijing] (Beijing: Guiji chubanshe 1983), p. 97 (translation after Wiedehage 1995, p. 368b). 44 Wiedehage 1995, p. 366b; Erickson 1994, p. 27; Zhao 1995, pp. 125b-126b with fig. on p. 125a.

In Müller' s opinion the phallic element in the cult of the Earth God is absolutely secondary and unimportant.47 In 1987 a lengthy hollow clay pillar 157 centimeters high and with a diam- eter of 31 centimeters was excavated in Dengjiawan of the Tianmen district in the province of Hubei. It was dated back to the year 3000 bc and ascribed to the Qujialing culture. It has burls and a clay rope wound around it [fig. 4]. The interpretation by Jeonghee Lee-Kalisch who sees it as a phallus is not convincing.48 Instead, the following hypothesis may be put forward. The pil- lar could be interpreted as the stem of an artificially constructed tree, as it is still used in Japan today as a sacred torch or lamp (taimatsu to be built, burnt and rebuilt every year [fig. 5].49 However, it is not known if any further examples of such trees have yet been identified in China. Also dating from the Eastern Han, we possess a type of ceramic lamp shaped as a tree with a mountain as its base. According to Erickson, the shape of lamp trees was influenced by the shape of money trees.50 A lamp tree, made of ceramic, 92 centimeters high, was excavated from a tomb in Jianxi Xilihe near Luoyang in Henan province in 1972 [fig. 6]. 51 A pillar acts as a substitute for the trunk of the tree. Branches are stuck into the pillar with plate-like flat lamps with flames at their ends. Blossoms, cicadas and human-shaped beings with wings perch on the branches. On top of the pil- lar a flat lamp can be seen in the shape of the mythical sun bird. With the sun and the cicadas symbolizing a rebirth in the new year after the winter months and promising immortality in the after world, the lamp tree seen as a tree of life is quite similar to our Christmas tree.52 Erickson relates the lamp tree with lights on its branches to the myth of solar trees.53 A tree, made of ceramic glazed in green and red, dating from the Western Han Dynasty, 63 centimeters high was found in a tomb near Sijiangou of the Jiyuan district in the province of Henan. The stem is a pillar- like axis, into which nine branches with apes, cicadas and birds are stuck. A bird identified as the "Heavenly Cock" (Tianji) sits on top of the pillar. The Heavenly cock announces the reappearance of the sun on the new day and the passage of the dead to immortality.

The arrangement may be three- dimensional around a central axis or two-dimensional in two parallel rows. An example for a parallel arrangement of the branches of the Fusang- tree is found in a relief in the tombs of the Wu Family near Jiaxiang in the province of Shandong.58 The periodic growth and maturity of seed capsules on a ficti- tious monthly plant was described in the Lunheng [Discourses Weighed in the Balance].59 In later texts the Fusang tree is suggested to be a mulberry tree with two trunks supporting each other, similar to trees growing to- gether {mulianli ^ iâ S).60 Souls dwelling in trees may also take on the shape of the birds living there. E.g., pine trees harbor birds, especially cranes. Even phoenixes perch on the boughs, as white rabbits hop around the roots.61 According to the Xijing zaji [Miscellaneous Notes from the Western Capital] of the Han Dynasty "[. . .] there was an old pine, to which tradition ascribed an age of more than a thousand years, and into which white cranes flew continuously".62 Trees of Death and Longevity as Habitat of the Ancestral Souls The Earth God rules the underworld and is lord of the subterranean water arteries transporting vital energy for agriculture.

As early as the Han Dynasty it was be- lieved that the region of a grave extended from heaven to the lower reaches of the earth.63 Even today the Earth God's presence is still required when the soil is touched, for example when building a house or digging a grave. Then his per- mission is asked for in a ceremony called "ground-breaking" (potu A).64 After the dead is buried and the grave is closed, until this day the tree is the preferred plant to place on a grave tumulus. It is also important to note that even today the ancestors' shrine for the dead of any village is built next to the tree of the Earth God in the cen- tral area of the village. Therefore, any mound with a sacred tree planted on top of it may be interpreted as belong- ing to the realm of the dead.65 It was presumed that the custom of marking a tomb by a tumulus was intro- duced to China by the Western Zhou Dynasty (1045-771 bc) from Siberia.66 Late Zhou bronze mirrors already show trees in combination with a hill.67 The Sanli tu [Drawings of the Three Forms of Rites], originally dating from the Eastern Han Dynasty, contains an illus- tration of grave mounds with trees on top or beside the mound [fig. 7]. 68 If trees were used as grave markers in the 63 Kleeman 1984, p. 14; Asim 1994, pp. 311-312, quotes from Jin Dynasty Jiang shi jiazhuan.

Thus the tomb of Chinggis Qan remained undiscovered.73 This may also have been true for the tomb of Shihuangdi (reigned 221-210 bc) of the Qin Dynasty as his grave mound was made to look like a hill.74 A tree planted on a grave mound may take up the soul of the dead person buried underneath. The tree becomes a residence for the soul and is animated by it. Trees are planted on a grave to strengthen the soul of the dead person. The idea is that if the soul is strengthened, the body will be saved from corruption. Pine, cypress, mulberry, catalpa or other trees could be planted on grave mounds as well. They harbor a lot of vital energy (qi) to pass onto the soul of the dead person that would otherwise be deemed to lose its vital en- ergy. It was thought that the vital energy contained in trees would protect the dead body from decay and prevent it from dissolving. Thus, trees stabilize the soul by living on the energetic substance (qi) of the interred body.75 This idea 68 Nie Chongyi (Song Dynasty) (ed.), [Xincheng zhengshi jiashu cbongjiao] Sanli tu (Sibu congkan xinbian-ed.), ;. 19, p. 5a. 69 Berger 1980, p. 88. 70 Baihu tong (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju 1994),;. 11, p. 559, lines 5 (translation from Tjan 1949-52, vol. 2, p. 651). 71 Hanwenjia , quoted in Baihu tong (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju 1994),;. 11, p. 559, lines 6-7 (translated after Tjan 1949-52, vol. 2, p. 651); cp.

The souls of the dead somehow re- sided in the branches and foliage of their grave trees. Trees were sensi- tive to the mourners' grief. Tears shed at the grave changed the trees' color. The well-being of the dead depended on the living members of the family looking after the grave tree. If the dead were well cared for, the family of the living was prosperous as well. This is why the branches and foliage were not only an indicator of the well-being of the dead buried underneath, but also of the living. If the living did not care for their dead, their own well-being was endangered. If a branch was lost, this meant a lack of care and the ensuing death of a member of the family. If the whole tree fell to decay, the family was destined to become extinct.77 congshu) (1158), "Shi Fang mu zhemu" [The Silkworm tree at the Tomb of Shi Fang] p. 23; Baoqing Kuaiji xuzhi [Continuation of the Local Gazetteer of Kuaiji in the Baoqing Era] (Song Yuan difang zhi congshu-ed.)

Building commenced one year after enthronement and trees were always planted on the grave mound.78 "Planting or sowing pines and cypresses with one's own hand" (shou zhi/zhong song bo -f- ft te #) became a topos of Confucian filial piety (xiao ^).79 On tombs of man and wife "intertwining or embracing stems or branches of twin trees" were likewise a topos for conjugal devo- tion.80 However, tomb trees were cut down completely with the intention of eliminating the dead and their offspring. This happened, for example, on the eve of the Qing Dynasty when Empress Dowager Cixi became suspicious of an ominous gingko tree growing on the tomb of Prince Chun (Yihuan), grandfather of the later Xuantong Emperor, and had the tree cut down.81 Spirits that take trees as their habitat, are souls (shen) with a human body of blood living in the tree. If the tree is cut down or burnt, the resident soul of the tree bleeds and utters cries of pain with a human voice.82 The Xuanzhong ji tells us that "the sap of a tree a hundred years old is red like blood." The Han philosopher Ge Hong in his work Bao Puzi says: "The deepest roots of cypresses a thousand years old have the shape of puppets in a sitting posture, seven inches high. When incisions are made therein, they lose blood [. . .]."83 If somebody is going to cut down the tree growing on the ancestral tomb of his family for the purpose of selling the timber, he is sure to meet his ancestors in his dreams giving him a warning as for example: "We have lived (zhu 3l) in this tree for three hundred and eighty years [...].

As they are thought to be no longer useful for profane purposes they do not run the risk of being cut down for fuel or timber.86 From ancient times onwards, rules were set up to protect trees from being cut. In order to save the forests in former times grass and bushes rather than trees were used as fuel for cooking. This is con- firmed by the fact that, as Menzies remarks, the words used for fuel were xin and rao their characters being written with the radical for grass and not for wood.87 In the 3rd century ad, we already find rules against arson in forests. According to the Tang lü shuyi [Code of the Tang Dynasty with Commentary], anyone who intentionally or unintentionally "caused fire" ( shi huo ýc) in the forests was to be punished. From the Tang Code up to the Qing Code heavy penalties were laid upon any person who accidentally set fire in the groves around the imperial mausolea and other sacred sites.88 The stealing of trees from the area of the imperial tumuli as well as theft of trees from anybody else's ancestral tombs was severely punished. The Tang Code records that stealing trees from within the imperial tomb pre- cincts was to be punished with two and a half years' banishment, theft of trees from other people's graves with one hundred strokes. From a Song collection of law cases we learn that it was not allowed to cut down grave trees and sell them. Besides being illegal, in Song times the selling of grave trees was considered as an act of inhumanity {buren ) and disrespect of filial piety (buxiao ^ According to the Qing Code, stealing trees from ordinary tombs was to be punished with one hundred strokes and cangue for one month.

Veneration of trees is closely linked to the Earth God cult and the cult of the ancestral souls, as the Earth God is thought to be present in trees as well as in the ancestral souls of those buried in the earth underneath them in the Earth God's realm. Trees erected on the altar of the Earth God and trees planted on ancestral grave mounds were both found to be similar manifesta- tions of the vital energy (qi) of a god or soul (both called shen). Trees as habi- tats for the Earth God or the souls were considered a visible link between heaven and earth in the sense of an axis mundi . Thus making the god s or souls' vital energy visible led to the anthropomor- phization of their respective trees as they evolved into pillars {zlou Jl) with en- gravings and then into images (xiang). In spite of Neo-Confucian attempts to reverse this trend, human-shaped representations of the Earth God and of an- cestral souls are still witnessed today. Yet, anthropomorphic images did not lead to the complete abandonment of trees which are still venerated today, especially in the countryside. Like their human-shaped counterparts, trees are believed to be living beings that contain human blood and speak with a human voice. If trees are properly cared for, the ancestors' family flourishes. If they are damaged or even cut down, they suffer and the respective ancestors' family becomes extinct. This may be the reason why in earliest times trees were buried with the dead inside the tomb. Various types of trees were created artificially for that reason. It is beyond doubt that artificial trees, hung with coins or equipped with lamps, served as a guarantee for the prosperity of the ancestral souls and their descendants. Trees are an essential link between the dead and the living, i.e. death and life. Death means life, i.e. immortality and fertility of the family. But trees were cut down or planted for other reasons as well, above all according to rationality and usefulness. In conclusion, we may underline the fact that in China there are very con- tradictory attitudes concerning the treatment of the tree: On the one hand, it is venerated as the visible form of vital energy of the Earth God and ances- tral souls but on the other hand nothing is done to prevent the tree's exploita- tion for its material value. These contradictions can hardly be reconciled.
