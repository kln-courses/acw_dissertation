I In spite of the many negative aspects of international block- buster exhibitions, it cannot be denied that their prepara- tion often generates a special synergy that may lead to advances in knowledge, sometimes resulting in nothing less than the redefinition of a field of research. The cata- logues of such exhibitions, partly no doubt because of their comparatively generous allotments of high-quality illus- trations, have developed into an increasingly influential vehicle of publication. This is particularly true in the field of Chinese art history, where loan exhibitions from China have become the focus of considerable original scholarly productivity. In the German-speaking world, especially, exhibition projects have served as important training grounds for new talent. The two lavishly-produced vol- umes here under review join the company of distinguished contributions from the United States,I as well as from Europe.2 It would not do these catalogues justice to regard them merely as a convenient source of illustrations; their texts, as well, deserve serious review. The two volumes were produced for the highly-ac- claimed exhibition of mostly recent archaeological finds from China that toured Europe from 1995-97. That the same show should have generated two different catalogues certainly constitutes an anomaly - in this case, a highly felicitous one. The volume edited by Roger Goepper (here- after referred to as Menschen), distributed at its venues in Essen, Munich, and Zurich, constitutes the catalogue of the show as it was originally conceived. For the showing in London, Jessica Rawson rearranged the exhibition and comprehensively rewrote the English version of the cata- logue, the result being the second work under review (here- after: Mysteries).3 Although comprising the same objects (with three exceptions),4 the two catalogues differ in almost every respect imaginable. The task of comparing them is a somewhat delicate one, as it appears that some sensibilities were hurt as a result of the reworking. This reviewer would, however, contend that each has its own merit, and that the international public is all the richer for having the two to juxtapose. II The exhibition presented in Menschen was, above all, a triumph of curatorship. Conceived and organized by Goepper, recently retired as director of the Cologne Mu- seum of East Asian Art, this exhibition was the culmination of its creator's distinguished career as a mediator of East Asian art and aesthetics to post-World War II Germany. Goepper must be congratulated on his brilliantly judicious choice of objects that are at the same time important and visually striking, as well as on his success in persuading his partners at the China Cultural Relics Promotion Center to obtain them. This reviewer was fortunate to experience the exhibition in the space for which it had been originally con- ceived: the Villa Hiigel, a late nineteenth-century industri- alist's mansion in the verdant suburbs of Essen. Goepper deserves the highest praise for fine-tuning the presentation of the objects so as to make them resonate with the Villa's stately ambiente- far more sensitively than had been the case at numerous previous exhibitions the reviewer had seen at the same venue. Far from being a mere poetic adage, the exhibition's subtitle, "Humans and Gods in the Middle Kingdom," intimates an overarching theme set by the organizer. A perusal of either of the two catalogues reveals that many of the objects on exhibit either constitute or comprise human images. Of course, the situation and significance of these representations differ considerably from period to period as well as according to their archaeological contexts, although (as with almost all art from ancient cultures) a generically religious or ritual function may usually be assumed. In this reviewer's opinion, the choice of such a theme is best appre- ciated as a curatorial strategy meant to provide an element of cohesion, albeit a very loose one, among the many and various beautiful objects in the exhibition. As such, the focus on "Humans and Gods" is extremely useful, as this reviewer can confirm from personal experience. The human figures aid in concentrating the viewer's gaze, enabling one to draw visual linkages among the objects and to experience the exhibition in its entirety as something approximating a staged event. In this respect, Goepper's exhibition stands in marked contrast to many comparable loan exhibitions of archaeological relics from China, which tended to combine objects in a disparate, even arbitrary fashion. His choice of topic was presumably geared to the proclivities of the European target audience, which has traditionally regarded 351</page><page sequence="2">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (I997), BOOK REVIEWS the depiction of the human figure (and the representation of deities in human form) as a supremely important goal of artistic activity. In the spirit of Buddhist updya, the "Hu- mans and Gods" theme may thus have reduced the public's threshold anxiety vis-a-vis this, to them, exotic show, even possibly enticing some visitors, if only at a half-conscious level, to begin understanding something about ancient China. III The exhibition's theme would thus seem to work best on the perceptual and psychological level of the late twentieth- century Western viewer. Indeed, the visitor of the exhibi- tion, and the reader of its catalogues, should be warned not to succumb to the temptation of intellectualizing the esthetic experience gained thanks to the curator's skillful juxtaposition of visually-relatable objects. As is well- known to anyone faintly acquainted with the subject, the human figure as such is not a prominent motif in early Chinese art - a fact acknowledged repeatedly in Helmut Brinker's lead essay "On the Origin of the Human Image in Chinese Art" (Menschen, pp. 13-35).5 It would follow logi- cally that a focus on "Humans and Gods" is unlikely to induce the public to perceive valid and representative his- torical relationships and cultural continuities. Perplex- ingly, however, Brinker assumes just the contrary, and he proposes various reasons (such as the allegedly anti-indi- vidualistic nature of primitive society [pp. 14-15], or an iconoclastic tendency motivated by an ingrained fear of the power of realistic icons [p. 21]) that might explain why relatively few depictions have survived in the archaeologi- cal record. As a result, his essay, though engaging and thoughtful, is replete with dubious reifications. In his effort to contextualize neolithic depictions of the human figure, Brinker sets out to reconstruct the spiritual universe of the prehistoric Chinese. Here he mostly follows previous studies by David N. Keightley, though Brinker tends to present as established fact what Keightley had much more cautiously formulated as tantalizing hypothe- ses." Moreover, while Keightley, like most Chinese archae- ologists today, is careful to distinguish among the many different regional traditions of prehistoric China, Brinker, in illustrating his ideas, indiscriminately adduces artifacts from all parts of the People's Republic, mentioning images from such neolithic cultures as Yangshao, Hongshan, Shijiahe, Liangzhu, and Hemudu in the same breath with wooden figurines from remote Xinjiang. In positing an essential continuity from prehistory into later Chinese civ- ilization, the author exhibits a remarkable and sometimes foolhardy optimism. For instance, he projects into remote antiquity such concepts as the dualism of hun and po souls (p. 14), the animals of the Four Directions (pp. 18-20), and the idea that jade renders the body immune from putrefac- tion (p. 15), none of which is reliably documented before the Han dynasty. According to Brinker, the human-headed snake depicted on the ceramic vessel from Qianmao, Tongchuan, Shaanxi province, is quite probably ancestral to the mythological figures of Fuxi and Niiwa (here mis- transcribed as Nidgua) (pp. 30-31I); and he posits that the Chinese ancestral cult was initially shaped by mythical figures from much later legendary accounts, such as Huangdi, Yao and Shun, whom he regards as "master thinkers of the East" (p. I7). Intermixed with such gestur- ing to traditional Han Chinese accounts of the earliest times, Brinker also presents ethnographic-sounding inter- pretations of prehistoric religious phenomena in terms of shamanism (p. 15 et passim) and fertility cults (pp. 33-34); elsewhere again, he aligns himself- perhaps unwittingly - with Marxist ideologues in considering Neolithic society as matrilineal, while at the same time pointing to Niiwa as the foundress of that type of social organization (pp. 28-29). Most serious sinologists would probably dismiss the whole mixture as wanton speculation. Brinker also elaborates, albeit not in a very systematic way, on the connection between early modes of depiction and the origins of the Chinese script. Here, too, the ground is much less secure than the author appears to realize. Intrepidly, he believes what to more cold-blooded ob- servers would appear to be more or less random scratchings on turtleshells from the Peiligang cemetery at Jiahu, Wuyang, Henan province, dating from ca. 5ooo B.C., to represent early forms (or "protographemes") of the later Chinese characters mu (eye) and ri (sun); and even though the turtleshells containing those two alleged characters were found in two separate tombs (Nos. 344 and 335), Brinker goes on to link them to the putative image of a bird on a turtleshell from yet another tomb at the same cemetery (tomb No. 387), taking the three items as evidence for much later cosmological myths about sunbirds.7 Particularly objectionable are Brinker's intermittent attempts at explaining cultural concepts through the graphic analysis of modern Chinese characters, as in the cases of ti (body), which, in an attempt to illustrate the Confucian concept of the body as "a holy vessel that had to be protected and cared for," he interprets as consisting of the signific "bone" com- bined with a second signific showing a vessel filled with 352</page><page sequence="3">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (I997), BOOK REVIEWS precious jades (p. 25); xing (clan name), where the two com- ponents, "woman" and "give birth/be born" are again both read semantically and taken to document the matrilineal stage of social organization (p. 29); and tong "pupil [of the eye]," where the right half of the character, tong (boy), is used as evidence for a fanciful theory of how the eye encap- sulates a miniature version of the human person (p. 29). Actually, in all three cases, the right half of the character is a phonetic component that does no more than indicate the pronunciation. Aside from such problems of fact, Brinker never bothers to explain why he regards such graphic games relevant to the understanding of preliterate stages in Chinese history. Similar criticism may also be levelled at his all-too-frequent recourse to quotations from Laozi and allu- sions to other late texts (including, in one case [p. 34], one of the unauthentic guben chapters of the Shangshu) as a way of embellishing his arguments. Merciful souls might interject that the nonspecialist target audience would never care about academic niceties, and that a catalogue essay should principally express ideas that will be found "interesting." But can one allow such a concern - valid though it may be - to override the scholar's responsibility of providing the lay reader with reliable information? One suspects that it is because of a basic philo- sophical difference on this point that Rawson decided to exclude Brinker's article from Mysteries. What does make this article interesting are the author's intimations of a theory, grounded ultimately in the philo- sophical esthetics of the European tradition, on how the early Chinese began to engage in representing the human figure. After an extensive quote from Alberti's De sculptura, Brinker goes on to point to Sir Ernst H. Gombrich's idea that the conscious representation of a thing by an artist is rooted in the psychological mechanism of projection, by which phenomena that are perceived as similar may be con- ceptually linked or even equated in the human mind. Aside from the fact that Brinker's overly literal interpretation of Gombrich's views awkwardly constrains him to posit that the invention of the dragon motif was inspired by the dis- covery of dinosaur remains (p. zo), the theory of projection might indeed prove useful for explaining the use of certain iconographic motifs in early Chinese art, especially in the context of correlative cosmology. Brinker, however, by no means exhausts the potential of such a line of analysis, lim- iting himself instead to showing, rather formalistically, how early artists rendered, e.g., kneeling or crouching figures as opposed to standing figures, and single figures as opposed to groups of figures. His concern with making his theory fit prehistoric finds from all parts of the People's Republic of China, moreover, blinds Brinker to what this reviewer would consider the most obvious art historical phenomenon concerning human representation in the art of continental East Asia. The archaeological record - even that segment of it that is represented by the objects catalogued in Menschen - ex- hibits a fundamental contrast: On the one hand, the human figure features quite prominently in the cultural traditions of regions surrounding what was to become the core area of the Chinese empire - be it in the Neolithic Hongshan cul- ture, the Sanxingdui culture of the Bronze Age, or, during the time contemporary with the Qin and Han dynasties, the Dian culture and the culture of the Xiongnu. Within the core area itself, on the other hand, one is confronted with an astonishing paucity of human imagery. When depicted at all, human beings are almost invariably tiny and/or shown in a subordinate position. Important figures, such as ances- tors or major deities, were apparently not represented anthropomorphically; worship of icons - a custom postu- lated by Brinker in connection with remains from the Hongshan culture ("pronounced iconoduly," p. 30) - does not seem to have been a significant characteristic of those prehistoric cultures that may be counted as the direct ances- tors of the Shang and Zhou. This negative observation must surely be of some relevance to understanding the nature of Chinese civilization during its formative stages, and it might be amenable to explanation in social-historical terms. Jessica Rawson attempts to do this in her excellent introduction to Mysteries (pp. 11-30), where she contrasts the tendencies towards ritual display in southern regional cultures with the most abstract, performative uses of ritual objects in north-central China; but this issue deserves a more comprehensive treatment. Significantly, the situation changed gradually after the founding of the Chinese empire, possibly under external influences.8 In this connec- tion, Brinker's suggestion that prehistoric tomb figurines in Xinjiang may be ancestral to those ofQin and Han China (p. 30), though quite out of place in his own essay, deserves further investigation. IV Pitfalls similar to those here highlighted with specific ref- erence to Brinker's essay also mar much of the rest of Mlenschen; their impact on the volume as a whole is so severe 353</page><page sequence="4">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (I997), BOOK REVIEWS as to risk alienating the knowledgeable reader. This may well be the reason why Rawson, in her London showing of the exhibition, de-emphasized the human-representation component of the exhibited works of art, and why Mysteries virtually abandons explicit reference to the "Humans and Gods" theme. While understandable, this decision is some- what unfortunate, both because the constellation of art- works does provide a rare opportunity of pursuing this visu- al theme, however marginal it may be to Chinese art histo- ry as a whole, and also because, in Goepper's show, the thematic focus on human representation had compensated for a certain imbalance in the selection of exhibited objects. Following twenty (in the case of Mysteries, twenty-one) items from the Neolithic and a strong cast of 30 from the Early Bronze Age, the exhibition comprised only six ob- jects excavated at Western Zhou sites, one thereof(Menschen No. 55/ Mysteries No. 54) a Neolithic jade ornament that, through avenues so far unknown, had come into the posses- sion of a Western Zhou individual.9 Even more seriously, the important period from the ninth to the mid-sixth cen- turies B.C. remains entirely unrepresented. Of the twenty- two Eastern Zhou exhibits (twenty in Mysteries), moreover, all but six are from the southern parts of the Zhou culture sphere, thus conveying a somewhat one-sided impression of that period and potentially encouraging the common but altogether unwarranted stereotype about the special impor- tance of the so-called "Chu civilization." The Han portion of the exhibition, as well, brings together a rather unsys- tematic sample of objects from different subperiods and places. For the conceptualization of Mysteries, this unevenness in coverage turns out to be somewhat more problematic than it had been in the case of Menschen, where representa- tive coverage and adherence to art historical chronology are patently secondary to the concern with anthropomorphic imagery. But Rawson handles the situation well by insert- ing appropriate contextualizing explanations that bridge the gaps in her material. Unlike Menschen, where the cata- logue proceeds in an unbroken flow, Mysteries moreover places the objects under a hierarchy of mostly chronological headings, each prefaced by succinct introductory passages. Together with Rawson's introduction (Mysteries, pp. II-30), these highly informative texts provide what, despite its voluminousness, Menschen most sorely lacks: a coherent and reliable account of early Chinese cultural history that may serve as a basic framework for understanding the signi- ficance of the exhibited objects. Although, as in most comparable exhibitions, the bulk of the material presented consists of unconnected single objects, Goepper commendably chose for each major peri- od one or several core groups comprising several objects from the same site, thus allowing occasional glimpses into assemblage patterns in the archaeological record. Here fol- lows a brief listing of these core groups: For the Neolithic, some spectacular Liangzhu jades from the elite tombs at Fanshan, Yuhang, Zhejiang province (eight objects; Menschen/Mysteries, Nos. 16-20); For the Early Bronze Age, some bronzes and jades from the sacrificial pits at Sanxingdui, Guanghan, Sichuan province, which were here presented in the West for the first time and consti- tuted the major sensation at this exhibition (seventeen objects; Menschen, Nos. 37-50/ Mysteries, Nos. 22-35), as well as objects from the tomb of Fu Hao (Fu Zi) at Anyang (Yinxu tomb No. 5), well-known to Western viewers through several previous loan exhibitions, but never before presented in such depth (twenty-three objects; Menschen, Nos. 25-36/ Mysteries, Nos. 39-50o); For the Late Bronze Age, bronzes from the Late Springs and Autumns period Chu tombs at Xichuan, Henan province (five objects; Menschen, Nos. 57-6o/ Mysteries, Nos. 58-6I), treasures from the Early Warring States period Zeng tombs at Leigudun, Suizhou, Hubei province (four items; Menschen, Nos. 61-62 and 72-73/ Mysteries, Nos. 62-65), and some of the finds from the Late Warring States period royal tombs of Zhongshan at Sanji, Pingshan, Hebei province (seven objects; Menschen, Nos. 65, 69, 76-77/Mysteries, Nos. 74-77); For the Early Imperial age, a jade suit and other furnishings from the royal tombs of Zhongshan at Mancheng, Hebei province (four items; Menschen 80-82/ Mysteries, Nos. 81-83), and some important lacquers and other finds from the Western Han tombs Nos. I67 and I68 at Feng- huangshan, Jiangling, Hubei province (five items; Menschen, Nos. 90-95/ Mysteries, Nos. 89-94). 354</page><page sequence="5">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (1997), BOOK REVIEWS As is apparent from the sometimes divergent number- ing, Rawson, in rearranging the exhibits for Mysteries, always emphasizes the joint placement of items from the same contexts, a practice not always followed in Menschen. Rawson's rearrangement not only follows more careful- ly than that in Menschen the cultural and chronological units established in contemporary Chinese archaeology, but it also reflects her tough-minded stance in puncto ancient Chinese historiography. This is particularly evident when she subsumes the Sanxingdui finds, together with those of neolithic date, under Part One, entitled "Unknown China" - a daring step, given that the Sanxingdui finds are rough- ly contemporaneous with the middle period of Shang. Nevertheless, this placement provides a salutary reminder that, with the exception of metropolitan Anyang, this por- tion of the Chinese Bronze Age is still, strictly speaking, prehistorical.'? Menschen, by contrast, in placing the San- xingdui finds after those from Anyang, not only reverses the actual chronological order of the two sites, but also insinu- ates that, as relics of a "provincial" culture, the Sanxingdui objects are by definition secondary and subordinate to those of the capital. Such a view, which has been criticized else- where," reflects naive nationalistic prejudice as well as, quite possibly, present-day political concerns'" that should not be allowed to taint scholarly arguments. In salient con- trast to Menschen, therefore, Rawson's own introductory texts and catalogue entries religiously avoid any mention of the speculation, currently embraced by most Chinese authors, that the Sanxingdui finds constitute early traces of the kingdom of Shu, which existed in western Sichuan at the end of the Bronze Age. The only places in Mysteries where such a historicizing interpretation is mentioned are the appended articles by Zhao Dianzeng (pp. 232-39 pas- sim), and Zheng Zhenxiang (p. 245); but it is stated in the form of a cautious hypothesis, in a stunning divergence from the same articles' German versions in Menschen. In the spirit of Rawson's sober approach to early Chinese historiography, it would not have been at all inap- propriate to place the Early Bronze Age Erlitou culture under the "Unknown China" rubric as well, but anyone acquainted with the importance attached in China to the officially-embraced identification ofErlitou with the semi- legendary Xia dynasty will appreciate why Rawson might have found it unwise to do so. Instead, the exhibition's lone object from Erlitou, an inlaid plaque (Menschen, No. 21/ Mysteries, No. 36), heads her Part Two, entitled "The Great Dynasties." Remarkably, nevertheless, the Xia dynasty is nowhere mentioned either in Rawson's introduction or in the catalogue entry on the Erlitou plaque - once again a great difference vis-a-vis Menschen, where the identity of Erlitou and Xia is explicitly asserted (pp. zoy-6). Indeed, Rawson could not have settled on a more fitting title for her catalogue; for Mysteries continually stresses how much is still unknown about Chinese civilization. The edi- tor is at her best when framing the many unresolved ques- tions raised by the new archaeological finds. While explic- itly refraining from speculation, she nevertheless hints at the considerable opportunities for new insights enabled by an unbiased consideration of the data. This reviewer would agree that here lies the main reason why the archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century are so important to the study of Chinese civilization. By contrast, the presentation of the material in Menschen is representative for tradition- bound Chinese scholarship in considering the new finds foremost as illustration (and sometimes clarification) of existing knowledge - knowledge that had been accumulat- ed through millennia of textual study. V Beyond such epistemological differences, the two cata- logues also differ in that Mysteries brings across its message with far greater economy. In Menschen, after a very brief introduction jointly authored by Goepper and Lei Cong- yun, the 273-page catalogue proper is preceded by twelve articles, contributed in equal proportions by Chinese and European scholars. Mysteries achieves a forty percent reduc- tion by shortening the catalogue entries to 187 pages and by eliminating four of the six articles written by Western authors, as well as trimming (in some cases severely) the contributions from China, which the editor was contractu- ally obliged to include. As a result, thematic overlap be- tween essays - a source for occasional internal contradic- tions in Menschen - is largely avoided in Mysteries, and the essay portion, here placed at the end of the volume and pre- sented in an order different from that in Menschen, is reduced from 153 to 62 pages. In the versions published in Menschen, the articles con- tributed by Chinese specialists come across as fairly typical of the mainstream of contemporary scholarship in the People's Republic. Significantly, most authors refer, whether explicitly or implicitly, to the late senior archaeol- ogist Su Bingqi's (909o-97) currently influential theories about cultural developments in ancient China.Is As official statements directed at a foreign audience, the articles 355</page><page sequence="6">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (1997), BOOK REVIEWS engage in a certain amount of what might be called self-ori- entalization. Nevertheless, and in spite of rather deficient annotation, the authors display a good command of their materials, and their interpretations are exemplary for the way in which archaeological finds are currently being inte- grated with traditional accounts of Chinese history. Just as with the already-discussed article by Brinker, however, the lay reader will find it an impossible challenge to separate the authors' genuinely valuable insights from flights of fancy generated by nationalistic and historiographical biases. What most astounds about Mysteries is that all of the six contributors from China were evidently persuaded to rewrite their articles, incisively changing their formula- tions and even sometimes their arguments in such a way as to agree with the much more cautious philosophical stance exhibited in the editor's own catalogue texts. Such stream- lining greatly enhances the catalogue's internal consisten- cy, but it deprives the six articles of their original flavor and isolates them from their Chinese scholarly context. While more reliable in information content, and thus undoubted- ly more suitable for the nonspecialist Western public, the versions published in Mysteries are blander than those in Menschen, and it can no longer be claimed that they render the Chinese consensus on the issues treated. Even a nonspecialist reader may find it a useful exercise to read the German and English versions of the six articles against one another. Doing so enables one to get a sense of how the original arguments stand up in the face of the epis- temological skepticism characteristic of much Western scholarship. Following the order in which they appear in Menschen, the contents of these six articles, and the main dif- ferences between their two versions, may be briefly sum- marized as follows.14 I. Chen Lie begins his general treatment of "The An- cestor Cult in Ancient China" (Menschen, pp. 36-44) with a somewhat awkward attempt at reconciling the Marxist condemnation of religious belief as a "burden left by prim- itive man to his civilized descendants" (p. 36) and the appreciation of religion as a precious cultural heritage. He traces the concept of an immortal soul and the beginnings of the ancestral cult to the earliest Paleolithic indications of ritualized burial, underscoring his argument with a mix of quotations from classical texts. Icon-worship by the neo- lithic people of the Hongshan culture is identified as the ancestral cult at the matriarchal stage of social develop- ment; there follow some speculations on early shamanism that are couched in ill-understood Frazerian concepts. For the succeeding patriarchal stage, Chen mentions indica- tions of phallus cults in some Late Neolithic cultures and recounts the origin myths of clans from the classics. He then goes on to explain, somewhat less controversially, the zongfa system of the Zhou and its differences from Shang sacrificial practice, the political use of mythological foun- der figures, and the functioning of state ancestral ritual. The decline of ancestral ritual towards the end of the Zhou dynasty is linked to the rise of Buddhism and Daoism. In Mysteries, Chen's article is placed close to the end (pp. 269-72); reduced to less than half of its original length, it is stripped of all theorizing about religion and most of its ref- erences to ancient texts. 2. Lei Congyun, in his "Religious Sites of Prehistoric China and Their Significance" (Menschen, pp. 68-75), also starts out with a brief consideration of Paleolithic remains. As part of an attempt to locate the origins of Chinese civi- lization in the Northeast, Lei then emphasizes what he regards as the first signs of increasing complexity in west- ern Liaoning around 6oo0 B.C., describing ritual-related finds (including anthropomorphic and zoomorphic im- agery) from a variety of sites in that area. He does, however, also mention pertinent discoveries from contemporary sites further south. Lei goes on to embrace Su Bingqi's notion of a social and ideological quantum leap around the turn of the third millennium B.C., allegedly leading to the rise of shamans as a class of religious professionals. As archaeolog- ical evidence for such a development, Lei extensively de- scribes the Hongshan sites of Dongshanzui, Kazuo, Liao- ning province and Niuheliang, Jianping, Liaoning, which, according to him, constitute the original manifestations of the traditional layout characteristic for sanctuaries of a specifically Chinese type. He then shifts his focus to the somewhat later Liangzhu burial platforms in the Hangzhou area, attempting to reconstruct some aspects of the under- lying shamanistic ideology and ceremonial behavior from their ritual jades. The version of Lei's article included in Mysteries (pp. 219-14) shows little change in substance, but is far more cautiously formulated and omits any allusion to the idea that a recognizably Chinese culture originally arose in the Northeast. 3. Yang Yang, at the beginning of his "The Evolution of the Chinese Jade Culture" (Menschen, pp. 95-Io5), places jade use in China into its circum-Pacific context. With 356</page><page sequence="7">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (I997), BOOK REVIEWS "jade culture," Yang apparently does not mean a specific archaeological culture, but the usage and appreciation of jade as an aspect of the evolving cultural tradition of China. True to the conventions of historical essay writing in China, he divides the history of the Chinese "jade culture" in three periods, predictably entitled "genesis" (Neolithic) "devel- opment" (Erlitou through Western Zhou) and "perfection" (Eastern Zhou through Han).5 After describing the early regional subdivisions of China according to Su Bingqi's scheme, and finding that jadeworking was most prevalent in a "jade crescent" reaching from Liaoning along the east coast of China, the article describes the jade types charac- teristic for each epoch and discusses their functions based on both archaeological context and written records such as the Zhou li. The r61e of the jade metaphor in Confucian phi- losophy is illustrated through pertinent anecdotes. While, in the German version of his article, Yang approvingly cites the well-known Yuejueshu passage about the "jade age" (Menschen, p. 97), the Mysteries (pp. 225-3I) version states instead: The importance of jade in the neolithic period has caused some later writers to insert a 'jade age' between the Stone and the Bronze Age, but as jade working was not universal throughout the Chinese landmass, this term is inappropriate (Mysteries, p. 226). 4. Zheng Zhenxiang, in "Fu Hao - A Royal Consort and Her Last Resting Place" (Menschen, pp. iO6-I4), integrates archaeological and inscriptional data to reconstruct the position of the royal consort Fu Hao (Fu Zi) in Shang soci- ety, as well as her historical r81e. Moving on to archaeolog- ical considerations, Zheng gives a description of Fu Hao's tomb and of the foundations of a rectangular building on top of the tomb, which she considers to have been an "ances- tral hall" dedicated to Fu Hao - an issue about which, inci- dentally, there are still divergent opinions.I Then she dis- cusses the Fu Hao bronzes: their usefulness in dating the reign of Fu Hao's husband, the possible meanings of their ornamentation (Zheng thinks it probable that the well- known taotie mask motif was originally derived from the tiger face), and their stylistic differences vis-a-vis regional- ly-manufactured bronzes from outlying areas. Accepting the equation of Sanxingdui and "Shu culture," Zheng con- cludes by affirming the political and cultural supremacy of the Shang over the Chengdu plain, but acknowledging at the same time that "Shu" cults and religious beliefs were entirely independent from those of Anyang. The Mysteries version of Zheng's article (pp. 240-47) deemphasizes the reference to Shu and avoids some of the author's more risky speculations, based on oracle-bone inscriptions, regarding Fu Hao's personal biography. 5. Zhao Dianzeng's "Mediator between Heaven and Earth: The Finds from Sanxingdui" (Menschen, pp. 15-29) describes the local Bronze Age culture in the Chengdu plain of Sichuan, especially a prominent walled settlement in Guanghan city that Zhao regards as an early capital of the Shu state. He then lists discoveries of sacrificial pits, out- standing among which are the two large pits at Sanxingdui, a locality within the Guanghan settlement. Zhao takes the Sanxingdui finds as a touchstone for a somewhat speculative reconstruction of "Shu" religious customs. The unique bronze images of human figures and heads are interpreted as representing shamans and other high-ranking partici- pants in large-scale rituals, whereas the huge zoomorphic masks with their protruding eyes are taken as ancestral emblems that may have been fixed to a wooden support resembling a totem-pole. There follows a consideration of the curious Sanxingdui "bronze trees" (according to Zhao, axis mundi-like connections between the different spheres of the universe), and of various items interpreted as symbols of authority. Zhao's interpretations are laced with extensive quotations from much later classical texts such as the Huayang guozhi and the Huainan Zi. For reasons already indicated, Mysteries (pp. 232-39) programmatically places Zhao's article before Zheng Zhenxiang's. The Shu connection is stated as a mere hy- pothesis, almost all references to later texts are elided, and the article is virtually reduced to its descriptive component. 6. Yu Weichao introduces his essay on "Humans and Gods in the Culture of Chu" (Menschen, pp. I30-35) with Kroeber and Kluckhohn's ethnographic definition of cul- ture as a system of behavioral patterns that expresses sym- bols and values - a concept that he courageously proceeds to apply to the archaeological material from the Middle Yangzi area. Applying the methodology pioneered by Su Bingqi, Yu traces what he calls the "Chu Culture" in an unbroken sequence from Neolithic through Han times, i.e. from a time long preceding the foundation of the histori- cally-documented state of Chu all the way to a period when Chu had long ceased to exist. After a four-phase account of the area's political history (inevitably based on late texts), he delves into a sophisticated discussion of intellectual cur- rents and their expression in art. While he admits that "until the late phase of the Springs and Autumns period, 357</page><page sequence="8">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (1997), BOOK REVIEWS the religious concepts of the Chu population hardly differed from those of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou periods in the north" (p. 134), he believes that characteristically Chu reli- gion and rituals developed thereafter and survived into the Han period. Even though the present reviewer would prefer to define the scope ofChu archaeology much more narrowly,'I Yu's views are widely influential in Chinese archaeology and certainly deserve being taken seriously. Disconcert- ingly, the author's original opinions are no longer at all rec- ognizable in Mysteries, where Yu's article is reduced to less than three pages (pp. 266-68). The new version eliminates all theoretical discussions and learned considerations of Chu history and cultural development, doing little more than to gesture to the alleged Chu characteristics of objects in the exhibition. VI The only two articles by Western scholars contained in both Menschen and Mysteries are those written by the two editors. Rawson's "The Ritual Bronze Vessels of the Shang and the Zhou" (Menschen, pp. 76-94/ Mysteries, pp. 248-65, the latter text slightly amplified in some places for purpos- es of clarification and emphasis) masterfully summarizes the manufacturing technology and stylistic development of ritual bronze vessels from Erlitou through Han times. This article is particularly strong in its treatment of Western Zhou bronzes and their transformation at the end of the period; useful formulations concerning the overall charac- teristics of Eastern Zhou bronzes are also given. Goepper, in "Precursors and Early Stages of the Chinese Script" (Men- schen, pp. 156-66/ Mysteries, pp. 273-8I), expounds on the basic features of the Chinese language and script, as well as on the place of calligraphy in the artistic traditions of China; the article may serve to dispel some popular misun- derstandings about the nature of Chinese characters. Aside from the essay by Brinker, the contributions to Menschen that were excluded from Mysteries concern topics of ancient Chinese ritual, cosmology, and religion. Within the editorial context of Menschen, the rationale for such treatments is evident - they suggest avenues for interpret- ing the anthropomorphic iconography and the ideological context of the objects in the exhibition. As such, they may not fit in with the more single-mindedly archaeological ori- entation of Mysteries. Nevertheless, all three articles are quite informative and well worth reading. Dieter Kuhn's richly-documented "Death Ritual and Funerals in Chinese Antiquity" (Menschen, pp. 45-67) judi- ciously compares the archaeological evidence from tombs with pertinent evidence from the classical texts, concluding that the latter reflect, at best, a very incomplete knowledge of the subtly diversified practices of antiquity.' Ranging from Neolithic through Han times, the article conveys a sense of the tremendous changes that occurred over the course of time, chief among which was the transformation of the tomb into a microcosmic representation of the out- side world after the middle of the fifth century B.C. More- over, it presents a well-argued summary of pre-Qin and Han attitudes about burial and associated ritual behavior. Andrea Keller's "Cosmos and Cultural Order in Early Chinese Mythology" (Menschen, pp. I36-48) is the outcome of research towards the author's Master's and Ph.D. theses,19 which are not easily accessible otherwise. The author endeavors to piece together, from texts of rather diverse dates, a narrative account of ancient Chinese mythology. Of course, this has variously been attempted before.z2 Moreover, as the author appears to be well aware, it might even legitimately be questioned whether one internally coherent system of mythology ever existed in ancient Chinese civilization - or, for that matter, in any ancient civ- ilization. Even so, Keller's interpretation of cosmogonic accounts and myths concerning cultural heroes appears competent and quite original. By and large, except for tak- ing a Han ceramic tree model in the exhibition as a shaman- istic axis mundi (pp. 141-42), the author wisely avoids detailed identifications of mythological motifs in archaeo- logical materials. The late Wolfgang Bauer further integrates the con- cerns of Goepper's exhibition with those of text-based Sinology in his "Believing and Rationality: On the Efface- ment of Gods and Spirits During the Second Half of the First Millennium B.C." (Menschen, pp. 147-55). While his opposition of religious and "natural-scientific" attitudes in pre-Qin and Han China reeks of reification, the article nev- ertheless constitutes a readable and welcome summary of attitudes towards the Supernatural in early Chinese texts. VII The entries discussing individual objects differ consider- ably among the two works under review. As the entire cat- alogue portion of Mysteries was written by the editor, that volume maintains a constancy in tone and focus that is lack- ing in Menschen. The latter is very much the product of mul- 358</page><page sequence="9">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (1997), BOOK REVIEWS tiple authorship. Goepper himself signs as author of the entries on the Sanxingdui materials as well as those related to the practice of writing; the others were the responsibili- ty, in approximately equal proportions, of Peter Wiede- hage and Jeonghee Lee-Kalisch, and one entry was con- tributed by Chen Lie. (Wiedehage and Lee-Kalisch, junior scholars trained by Goepper, also earned considerable merit translating the six Chinese articles.) In Menschen, each entry consists of two portions: the first, printed in larger typeface, giving an overall apprecia- tion of the object, followed by extensive and detailed description as well as discussion summarizing the Chinese scholarship. Sometimes these summaries are magisterial, e.g. in Goepper's Sanxingdui entries, which subject the many and often ludicrous hypotheses in the published lit- erature to critical yet fair and often quite sympathetic eval- uation. Often, however, the small print reads like half- digested jottings transferred from filecards. In her much shorter entries for Mysteries, Rawson eliminates everything in the Menschen entries that is implausible or based on later texts. As a result, her entries may be read almost as a criti- cal commentary on those in Menschen, obviating the need for this reviewer to comment on the latter's many problems - a task for which, in any case, space would not suffice here. Sustained comparison of individual entries from the two books is highly recommended to anyone wishing to obtain an idea of how much (or rather, how little) of conventional Chinese scholarly treatments on art historical issues will stand up to the scrutiny of a skeptical Western scholar. Rawson, however, does not merely condense and filter the information given in the Menschen entries; she also adds observations stemming from her own perusal of the archae- ological reports, often raising matters of importance, as when she points out (p. 97) that "rather surprisingly, all fortyjue [from Fu Hao's tomb] were found outside the main coffin chamber" - a point omitted from the much longer Menschen entry on the same object. Whereas the Menschen entries emphasize decoration motifs and their possible meaning, Rawson's considerations mainly gyrate around two topics: the ritual function of the objects (inasmuch as may be reconstructed from their assemblages and place- ment in the original contexts of discovery), and their typo- logical derivation (e.g. whether a certain object or ornament is typical for the central areas ofShang or is ofperipheral ori- gin). Pursued from object to object through the catalogue, her comments, though unsystematic, add up to something like a story line, complementing that of Rawson's own arti- cle in the latter portion of the book. Rawson commendably provides footnotes and reference material at the end of each entry, whereas in Menschen this information is inconveniently placed at the end of the vol- ume. The four full-page maps in Menschen (pp. 482-85) are reduced to two in Mysteries (pp. 282-83), but with the names of places actually on them rather than keyed to numbers, as is the case in Menschen. Furthermore, Mysteries eliminates the "synchronoptical overview" given at the end ofMenschen (pp. 486-9I), where objects in the exhibition are placed within a chronological framework of events in world histo- ry; and it eliminates from the time chart (p. 284) those peri- ods not represented in the exhibition, whereas the chart in Menschen (p. 481) reaches all the way into the present - another manifestation of that volume's occasional tendency to present superfluous information. Regrettably, Mysteries also suppresses the extensive list of Chinese characters appended to Menschen (pp. 492-94)- though it must be said that that list contains some mistakes and gives Mainland- style abbreviated characters rather than the full forms, which alone are acceptable in Western scholarly writing. Another telltale difference is that between the bibli- ographies of the two works. Even a cursory review of the one in Menschen (pp. 495-5oo00) reveals dozens of mistakes - in orthography (this reviewer's 1993 book, for instance, is quoted as 'Suspended Musik'), transcription of Chinese words," and publication information (Colin Ronan's Shorter Science and Civilization in China is ascribed to one 'Colin, R.', etc.)- as well as innumerable inconsistencies in format. Even more annoyingly, that bibliography by no means assembles all works cited in the book: for those referred to in some of the essays, one still needs to search through the footnotes. The bibliography in Mysteries, by contrast, is exemplary both in format and editing, the number of mis- takes being minimal. VIII While this review is not the place for an extensive critique of the catalogue entries, some points of detail ought to be made. As a general point, Menschen, in describing objects, far too frequently indicates (italicized, in brackets) Chinese terms for which a perfectly viable translation exists; this weighs down the text and irritates the reader. Such a prac- tice is particularly problematic in connection with the entry titles naming the objects on exhibit. For instance, the catalogue designates neolithic pottery items by modern 359</page><page sequence="10">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (1997), BOOK REVIEWS Mandarin vessel-names such as pen, pan, bo, guan, and hu, thus conveying the mistaken impression that such were the original designations for these objects (as is indeed the case with some later bronze types). In fact, the usage of these present-day words by archaeologists is not standardized, leading to much confusion. Commendably, Mysteries eschews this problem by designating the respective objects merely as "basin," "bowl," "jar," "pitcher," and so forth. Other problems of object nomenclature include the fol- lowing. I. The shouldered bronze vessel with cover in Menschen No. 29/ Mysteries No. 44 is self-evidently the square variant of the lei (for a coverless round specimen from Sanxingdui, compare Menschen No. 42/ Mysteries No. 27) and should con- sequently be classified asfanglei, notfanghu, as done in both catalogues. 2. The two masks in Menschenl Mysteries No. 52 were almost certainly shield buckles (something both catalogue entries merely indicate as a vague possibility); inscribed specimens from the very tomb where the two items were excavated, tomb no. II93 at Liulihe (n.b. this is the name of a township in Fangshan county, Beijing; Wiedehage's translation as 'Liuli River' [Menschen, p. 280 et passim] is quite unwarranted), even document what seems to have been an ancient term designating such items, chang. 3. It is regrettable that neither catalogue provides a translation of the inscription on the flat-bottomed tripod from tomb no. 2 at Xiasi, Xichuan (Menschen No. 59/ Mysteries No. 58).23 The inscription gives the name of this object as ding (tripod), and the object is usually referred to as the Wangzi Wu-ding after its donor. Some other exam- ples of the same type, however, are named in their own inscriptions as sheng'. Sheng', a word only known from bronze inscriptions, undoubtedly designates a specific typological subgroup of ding. But sheng, should not be con- fused with shengding, the term by which the Wangzi Wu- ding is named in both catalogues. The word shengding is a neologism designating tripods (ding) that were used for the meat sacrifice known from the ritual classics as sheng2, and thus emanating from a functional, not a typological clas- sification. While one cannot exclude that the Wangzi Wu- ding may have served, on occasion, as shengding, it has been shown that tripods of such function cannot be distin- guished on the basis of typological criteria from ding that were used at other kinds of rituals. 4 The historical background of this vessel - one of a set of seven - deserves a brief excursus as both catalogues render it in a somewhat garbled fashion. Its donor Wangzi Wu (or Prince Wu, as the name is translated in the two cata- logues)25 is a figure well-known from written historical records. He served not only as "marshal of cavalry" (Sima) under his brother, Gong Wang of Chu, as Rawson men- tions (Mysteries, p. 124), but also, from 558-52 B.c., as chief minister (Lingyin).26 Lee-Kalisch (Menschen, pp. 296-99 et passim) unquestioningly accepts the identification, propa- gated in the final report, of tomb no. 2 at Xiasi as that of Wangzi Wu.27 Rawson commendably begs to differ and writes (Mysteries, p. 124): "It is likely that [tomb no. z] was the tomb of Peng, who was probably the same man as one Yuan Zifeng, who had served as the chief minister of Chu from 551 BC until his death in 548." One of the several rea- sons why this seems indeed certain is that the Wangzi Wu- ding have flat covers that, to judge from their shape, were posteriorly fitted to the tripods; these covers have inscrip- tions mentioning "Peng, scion in a junior lineage of Chu" (Chu Shuzhisun Peng). As one can confidently exclude (pace Lee-Kalisch [Menschen, p. 299]) the possibility that some- one of such lineage-ranking could have been the same per- son as Wangzi Wu, it follows that Wangzi Wu's tripods must have secondarily entered Peng's possession.28z What is truly curious is that - perhaps in an attempt to propagate the "official" identification of tomb no.2 as that of the more prestigious historical figure Wangzi Wu - the flat cover made by Peng for the Wangzi Wu-sheng' was not included in the exhibition. 4. In an exceedingly detailed study, Alain Thote has convincingly demonstrated that the bronze statue of an antlered crane from tomb no. I at Leigudun (Menschen No. 62/Mysteries No. 63) served as a tambourine stand - a fact that rather surprisingly goes unmentioned in both cata- logue entries. 9 5. Li Ling has shown that the original designation used for rectangular flasks such as the lacquered wooden one in Menschen No. 92/Mysteries No. 93 waspi orpike;3o though the more conventional designation as bianhu ("compressed hu") used in the two catalogues, is also acceptable. IX In conclusion, the contrasts between the two works are obvious. Menschen, with its pronounced preference for spec- ulative explanation over admission of ignorance, may be characterized as multifarious, enthusiastic, audacious, 360</page><page sequence="11">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (1997), BOOK REVIEWS uncritically syncretistic, and beholden to all sorts of stereo- types. Mysteries, by contrast, is severe, cautious, rigorous, and tending towards the monolithic. From an academic standpoint, Mysteries must be pronounced to be consider- ably superior to Menschen. But as the preceding lengthy dis- cussion has aimed to show, the two works - guided as they are by diametrically different editorial philosophies - are really quite different in nature, and Mysteries cannot be said to have supplanted Menschen. Menschen is, basically, a piece of inspirational literature, to be taken home and pondered over; Mysteries, on the other hand, is most useful as a sup- plier of basic orientation for visitors of the exhibition. The fact that Menschen includes such an overabundance of information (albeit much of it contradictory or even irrel- evant) may have a valid rationale given that there is a lim- ited amount of information on Chinese archaeology avail- able in German, while English-speaking readers can turn to a sizable and ever-increasing body of writings in their own language. In spite of its weaknesses, therefore, Menschen undoubtedly renders a valuable service to its German read- ership, though it is much more useful when read side-by- side with Mysteries as a corrective. Mysteries, on the other hand, may be unreservedly recommended in and of itself. It is a highly competent, accessible, and above all reliable summation of some of the more salient recent discoveries in Chinese archaeology.

An English version of that booklet was also produced (Men and Gods: New Discoveries from China, Humblebaek: Louisiana Museum, I997). The reviewer is grateful to Dr. Jessica Rawson for making him aware of this material. 4 Menschen does not include one sensational Neolithic object shown at the London exhibition: an inlaid jade hair ornament from the Classical Longshan cemetery at Zhufeng, Linqu, Shandong province (Mysteries, no. z21); on the other hand, Mysteries lacks the Warring States period tomb-pro- tecting monster (zhenmushou) from Tomb No. I at Tianxingguan, Jiangling, Hubei province (Menschen, No. 74), as well as a dagger with human-shaped handle, probably of Warring States period date, from Changsha, Hunan province (Menschen, No. 67). As a result, Menschen com- prises II9 catalogue numbers - which sometimes include more than one object - whereas Mysteries has only 118. 5 This essay has since been published in English in Kaikodoiournal 3 (1997), I8-47. 6 David N.

The phenomenon that the Bronze Age flite in China engaged in the collecting ofNeolithic jades was first coura- geously pointed out by Hayashi Minao ("Inkyo Fukobo shutsudo-no gyok- 361I</page><page sequence="12">ARTIBUS ASIAE, LVII 3/4 (I997), BOOK REVIEWS ki jakkan ni taisuru chufishaku," Toyo gakuhi 58 (1986); republished in his Chfigoku kogyoku-no kenkyu [T6kyo: Yoshikawa Kbbunkan, 1991] 515-76); after years of skepticism, this idea is now enjoying increasingly general recognition.

I4 In the following enumeration, the titles given are translated direct- ly from the German ones in Menschen; in Mysteries, some of them are abbre- viated or changed. I5 The German translator of Yang's text has failed to recognize the basic structure of Yang's essay and mistakenly rendered "perfection" in the sense of "formation" (Menschen, p.Ioo). Mysteries gives the correct title to the final section of the article (p. 230o: "climax"), but here the intended tri- partite evolutionary sequence is obscured by the division (quite justifiable, given its length) of that section into two parts, the first of which is simply entitled "The Eastern Zhou period." This is rather characteristic of the streamlining effected in the process of editing Mysteries. 16 See the discussion of tomb buildings in Li Boqian, "The Sumptuary System Governing Western Zhou Rulers' Cemeteries, Viewed from aJin Rulers' Cemetery," Festschriftfor K.C.

Samuel Noah Kramer (New York: Doubleday, 1961), 367-408; Kwang-chih Chang, Art, Myth and Ritual: The Path to Political Authority in Ancient China (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, i983) (as well as the relevant portions in Kwang-chih Chang, Early Chinese Civilization, An Anthropological Perspective [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1976]); Wolfgang Mtinke, Die klassische chinesische Mythologie (Stuttgart: Klett, 1976); and Anne Birrell, Chinese Mythology: An Introduction (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, I993). 2, Since such mistakes escape notice most frequently, here is a list of some found in the course of a first reading. P. 495: 'Jingman' instead of Jingshan, 'Zhang Bingchuan' instead of Zhang Bingquan; p. 496: 'Chfigaku' instead ofChfigoku, 'bunkatekki' instead ofbunkateki; p. 497: 'congbai' instead ofchongbai (again on p. 498), 'Mou Yongkan' instead of Mou Yongkang; p. 498: 'Fuguomu' instead of Guo guo mu, 'So Ko Yitsu Bo' instead of So Ko Otsu bo, 'Shijian yanjiu' instead of Shiqian yanjiu, 'Takayasu Higuchi' instead ofHiguchi Takayasu; p. 499: 'lewu' instead of yuewu, 'qingdongyue' instead of qingtong yue, 'Yin xu qingdongqi instead of Yinxu qingtongqi, 'Yti Ying-shi' instead of YiU Ying-shih, 'Liangling' instead ofJiangling, 'Shenzhi chongbai' instead of Shengzhi chongbai; p. 5oo:'qingqi quanji' instead ofqingtongqi quanji. Additional mistakes of this kind occur in the List of Chinese characters, as well as, needless to say, throughout the text. 22 Zhongguo Shehuikexueyuan Kaogu Yanjiusuo et al., "Beijing Liulihe II93 hao damu fajue jianbao," Kaogu 1990.1, 29-30. 23 A full translation of this inscription appears in Gilbert L. Mattos, "Eastern Zhou Bronze Inscriptions," in Palaeographic Sources of Chinese History, Edward L. Shaughnessy, ed., (Berkeley: Institute of Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, 1997). 24 Li Ling (Lothar von Falkenhausen, trsl.), "On the Typology of Chu Bronzes," Beitrige zur Allgemeinen und Vergleichenden Archidologie II (I99i), 72-74. 25 Once on p. 128, Rawson renders Wangzi Wu as "the prince ofWu," which is unallowable. 26 This fact is actually mentioned in the inscription of the tripod under discussion. At that point, the inscription suddenly refers to the donor as Zi Geng; but it happens to be known from the Zuo zhuan that this was an alternate name of the same individual. 27 Henan Sheng Wenwu Yanjiusuo, Henan Sheng Danjiang Kuqu Kaogu Fajuedui, and Xichuan Xian Bowuguan, Xichuan Xiasi Chunqiu Chu mu (Beijing: Wenwu, 199I). 28 The identification of tomb no. 2 as that of Peng is confirmed by the fact that the bulk of inscribed bronze vessels from that tomb, as well as from two neighboring large tombs, mention Peng as the donor. These neighboring tombs - nos. I and 3 - are in all likelihood those of Peng's principal wives. While the fifteen small tombs surrounding Peng's tomb are undoubtedly those of human sacrifices, and the three main tombs con- tain additional skeletons besides those of the principal tomb occupants which may have been high-ranking human sacrifices, there is no reason to assume -pace Lee-Kalish (Menschen, p. 292) - that the principal occupants of the wives' tombs, as well, were put to death at the time of Peng's burial.
