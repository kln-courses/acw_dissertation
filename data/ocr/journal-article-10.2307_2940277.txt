<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY AND EDIFICATION T HERE was a time when philosophy was unique in the college cur- riculum. It was depended upon to lend dignity to the work of the senior year and had about it something of the aspect of an Initia- tion into the Mysteries. It was taught by the chief executive of the institution as his especial and cherished prerogative, and, as he was almost invariably a minister of the gospel, the philosophical studies involved "Christian Evidences" almost to the point of evangelism. All this is undoubtedly obsolescent. The renaissance, having gradu- ally gathered strength for four centuries, is at last penetrating even cur institutions of learning, and the most treasured relics of medie- valism are doomed relentlessly to eventual oblivion. It is amazing in how short a time what was once genuinely sacred has come to seem grotesquely sanctimonious. But now the pendulum is swinging high in its opposite arc and philosophy is adjured in the name of its in- trinsic dignity to renounce all function of edification and to pursue its abstract goal in the unruffled calm of disinterested and dispassion- ate thinking. In some quarters the squeamishness on the subject has become so acute that a man scarcely dares speak above a whisper lest he should seem to be an advocate, nor to be in earnest for fear of seeming to be dogmatic. It is entirely possible, too, that such may be the typical attitude of philosophy in the future. But it is also pos- sible that that latter state would be worse than the first. At least, one begs to think that philosophy should be slow to repudiate entirely its traditional service and responsibility. No doubt the present revolt against all "inspirational" efforts in philosophy is primarily a protest against intellectual dishonesty</page><page sequence="2">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 551 which is so often the outcome of a professed aim to edify. Sometimes a man shrinks from teaching what he really thinks explicitly because he fears it may "shake the faith" of his students; his aim is com- mendable, but this way hypocrisy lies. On the other hand, too rest- less a desire to edify may react directly on the thinking of the teacher himself, so that he becomes a passive mouthpiece for tradition rather than a quickening spirit in the quest of truth. In the face of either of these alternatives no protest, of course, could possibly be too solemn, and one can only admire those who most fearlessly utter it. At the same time, however, the protest itself is aimed at the edifica- tion of the profession and deals immensely more with the ethics than with the mere methodology of the philosopher's undertaking. It is hard to set a limit to the indirect inspirational quality that the pur- suit and teaching of philosophy may, and certainly very often does, have. It is the purpose of this paper, in spite of a sincere respect for the timely protest just referred to, to defend the claim of a legitimate place in philosophy for a quite unique and perfectly definite office of edification. It is no mere accident that ethics should, by almost universal con- sent, be regarded as a collateral of general philosophy and meta- physics. James quotes with approval the view of Chesterton: "The most practical and important thing about a man is still his view of the universe. We think that for a landlady considering a lodger it is important to know his income, but still more important to know his philosophy. . . . We think the question is not whether the theory of the cosmos affects matters, but whether in the long run anything else affects them. " And such seems to be the tacit view of our whole educational system in regarding ethics and metaphysics as correlative aspects of philosophical discipline. Not only present practise, but all past history as well, attests this relationship. Stoicism, epicureanism, Christianity, were theories of the universe or ethical systems, just as you please; and it is very doubtful if such a general appercu could possibly be one without being the other. The special sciences are in a manner saved from this practical responsibility because of the very nature of the mate- rial with which they deal. It is hard for any student to feel that his soul's welfare hinges much on the detail of a botanical specimen or the constitution of a chemical compound, but misgivings arise and questions multiply the instant one's general world-view is touched upon. Such a state of affairs may not be desired nor desirable from the side of the philosophical profession, but it is de facto the case. The actual material with which ethics deals is obviously more closely related to sociology, for instance, than to metaphysics, but it is not probable that ethics will very soon find its academic allegiance trans-</page><page sequence="3">552 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ferred to that department. In this field the point of view counts for more than the subject-matter; and a man's metaphysics, expressed or assumed, unavoidably forms the background of his thinking and lends its perspective to his life. Philosophy may not consciously aim at edification, but the chances are overwhelming that that will be one of two simple alternatives as to its final outcome and total effect, and it is hard to see any good reason why the philosopher should remain arbitrarily and dogmatically indifferent to so real an element in the situation. This does not mean, however, that one need permit one's views to become biased in content by the rhetoric of popular tradition or the lure of one 's native longings. The latter at most might be allowed to guide the mode of presentation and the distribution of emphasis. Indeed it is doubtful if anything could more easily defeat the end of edification than a cowardly and equivocating attitude on the part of men who profess, etymologically, to be "lovers of wisdom" in its pure estate. College students are rarely blind to the slightest lack of frankness or independence in the expression of a teacher's views, and especially is that the case in philosophy, because it deals with such ultimate and intimate things. It arises in wonder and anxious ques- tioning, and whatever its objective speculations, it is idle to expect it to become, in its fruition, an indifferent and impersonal affair. Hu- man philosophy does not have to be anthropomorphic in its content in order to be anthropocentric in its foundations and final interests; it is perfectly possible to combine scrupulous intellectual honesty with a broad and deep human sympathy. If, accordingly, equivocation is itself unedifying, so also is ex- plicit exhortation, not because its purpose is false, but because as a method it is almost certain not to succeed. It proclaims that the exhorter has a specific ax to grind and his message, whatever it is, is correspondingly discounted. In other words, its very sin is that it fails to edify. This also answers in advance the obvious rejoinder that other agencies are already paid to attend to the "salvation " of the community, of which burden, therefore, philosophy may well feel itself relieved. There are many minds, especially those who would find philosophy congenial, who are constitutionally insensitive to ecclesiastical exhortation in any form,-mainly, no doubt, because all dogma is an admitted and explicit prejudice. The latter fact also makes it difficult, if not impossible, for ecclesiastical agencies to pro- mote, even when they themselves do not lack, the virtue of intellec- tual honesty, the cardinal virtue of science and of constructive thinking. But suppose the philosopher finds that the purpose to edify stands hopelessly at odds with his own sense of intellectual integrity? That</page><page sequence="4">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 553 might conceivably be the case. If the reality of the world as he is forced to see it simply is not inspiring or elevating in any sense, the situation is not indeed a happy one. But it only raises the further question as to whether everything is worth teaching. If one were profoundly convinced that the ultimate aspect of the world is abso- lutely dismal and discouraging, there would be little to be gained in spreading the discouragement. If all the dignity and value and beauty of life rests upon illusion, one earns a miserable living whose job in the world is merely to dispel that illusion. If there were no bliss except in ignorance, knowledge itself would be a poor virtue. It is questionable, however, whether there is or ever has been such a view of the world. There have been systems of pessimism, no doubt; yet for the hero there is room in every one of them. Even Schopenhauer finds a "way out," a salvation through art. And in so far as Schopenhauer inspires men to face pain courageously, to be austere and self-reliant in a universe that offers little, and to find in beauty the apotheosis of the heart's desire, he is edifying them even in the midst of his metaphysical gloom. No one would accuse Ber- trand Russell of sentimentality. A theory of perceptual classes, neutral entities, and logical systems resembles little enough an anthropomorphic gospel. But even here the free man finds an ideal to worship and becomes himself the Atlas of the moral world. These, indeed, are good examples of the kind of inspiration philosophy may furnish without resorting to exhortation, to orthodoxy, or even to explicit moralizing. There are two different purposes for which a man might seek to be guided through a city, two points of view from which he might see everything it contained. On the one hand, he might have the casual interest of a visitor, merely, or that of a geographer or statis- tician or shopper. In this case, whatever his specific errand, his in- terest would be detached and relatively impersonal. On the other hand, he might see it all from the standpoint of one who was going, for better or for worse, to make his home in it. In this event his in- terest could not help being essentially practical and personal. And this may be taken to illustrate somewhat the distinction between the point of view of the sciences and that of philosophy. The details of the subject-matter of a special science concern problems and issues that we may only occasionally or never meet. It is hard to make such facts seem momentous. But the infinite canopy of the universe is, after all, the place we must live in and to the general order of which our lives as wholes must adjust themselves. It is unavoidable, therefore, that philosophy should always have a personal aspect or bearing, because it deals with the very setting of life. The student who enters upon the study of it soon finds that the problem of the</page><page sequence="5">554 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY universe at large is a distressingly intimate affair; it becomes a gigantic frame about his finite destiny. His cosmos is the place in which he must get to feel at home and find a task. A man's efforts at such orientation and allignment constitute his philosophy, and success in these efforts would not be a bad name for edification. BENJAMIN W. VAN RIPER.
