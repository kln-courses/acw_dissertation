<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESILIENCE AND VULNERABILITY: Enset Agriculture in Southern Ethiopia* Dessalegn Rahmato Introduction The noted French historian, Fernard Braudel, has argued that the world's three major food plants, wheat, rice and maize, have exercised such profound influence on the material and spiritual culture of the regions in which they have historically been dominant that they should be considered not as humble food crops but rather as "plants of civilization". He goes on to examine the distinctiveness of the wheat-growing civilization of pre-modern Europe, the rice-growing civilization of the Far East, and the maize-growing civilization of pre-Columbian America (Braudel: Ch. 2). He views this distinctiveness not merely in terms of dietary preferences and habits but also in terms of the rhythm of labor, the choice of technology, the nature of social relations, and the flow of commerce associated with the cultivation of each of these crops. In a similar vein, we may identify three major plants which can be linked with three broad cultural ecologies in this country: teff in the northern highlands, enset in the south, and maize-sorghum in eastern and western Ethiopia. I use the term "culture" here in the dual sense, ie. both relating to socio-practice and agro-practice. Of course in present conditions», when many plants have "migrated" from one cultural ecology to another (with enset somewhat of an exception), this distinction may not be fully justified, but it may serve as a point of departure for re-assessing the agro-cultural diversity of the country. In this paper I shall be concerned mainly with the dynamics of enset agriculture in Wollaita where I have done field work since the early 1980s. I shall occasionally compare some aspects of rice and enset culture for illustrative purposes, for I believe there are some interesting parallels between the two. Due to space limitations, I shall not cover all aspects of Wollaita' s enset culture either in the broader sense of the term noted above or in the sense suggested by Braudel. Nevertheless, I hope to show the interconnection between enset cultivation on the one hand, and demography, migration, property devolution and medical history on the other. Such a holistic approach is often lacking in enset studies1. The enset zone covers a relatively wide area, stretching roughly along the lower half of the Rift Valley, and over the highlands between it and the Gibe-Omo River valleys. The moist environments west of the Omo should also be included in the enset zone, though our knowledge of this part of the country is scanty. The plant serves as a staple food for about seven to eight million people who live mostly 23</page><page sequence="2">in dense and distinct settlements. Among the primary cultivators of enset are the Gurage, Hadiya, Kambatta, Wollaita, Sidama, Gedeo, and the groups that live in the Gamo highlands. The area inhabited by these ethnic groups may be considered as the original center of enset cultivation; however, enset has "migrated" to the adjacent areas, in particular to the areas west of the Gibe valley inhabited by Oromo speakers. Here enset is cultivated mainly as a hardship crop, and to supplement the household diet (vid. Kassahun et al. 1988, 1989). In the enset zone proper, in contrast, enset is not a famine or hardship crop but a valued one. Enset is usually grown in moist woyna degga and degga environments; altitudes between 1700 and 2500 meters above sea level may be the most suitable for it. It does grow in high degga areas as well, but the results are not as satisfactory. It is uncommon to find it cultivated in the dry lowlands, particularly in areas much below 1500 meters; the plant moreover does not respond well to irrigation. Enset is not a delicate crop; once established, it can tolerate considerable environmental stress (though not a prolonged dry spell) and does not require much labor. Moreover, what has enabled enset cultivators to weather out periods of environmental hazard and food shortage is that enset can be harvested and consumed before it is fully mature, though in this event the quality of the food obtained and the yield of the plant will be very poor. Thanks in part to these qualities of the plant, the enset zone has suffered few food crises in the past, and many of the communities here have no famine history at all. The plant's main enemies are crop disease and rodents. Outside of its home-base, enset has always been considered a "backward" crop, suitable only for marginal people, the poor or the starving, and this may explain why until recently very little attention was given to enset agriculture by government agencies. Enset as food plant is also unknown outside Ethiopia, though wild enset grows in parts of eastern Africa and the Sudan. It is not included among the root crops that are now attracting a good deal of interest among donors and international research institutions (FAO 1989, Terry, 1987, World Bank 1979). While there are differences among enset cultivators with regard to crop and land management, there are agronomic practices shared in common throughout the enset zone, and these include the following: first, enset cultivation involves the planting of enset not just as one crop among others but as a strategic crop determining cropping plans, land use, use of technology, and consumption and marketing decisions. The earlier literature describes the enset system as a system of monoculture based on the almost exclusive cultivation of the plant, with other farm activities playing subsidiary roles (Smeds 1955, Shack 1963). This view, which few students of the subject will accept today, ignores the strategic part played by the crop, and hence obscures the dynamic nature of the enset system (see below). 24</page><page sequence="3">Secondly, the enset system is an intensive production system; we will return to this point later. Thirdly, like rice cultivation in Asia, enset agriculture is viable even as a micro-enterprise, and this explains why the enset zone continues to carry an enormous accumulation of population. Population densities of over 400 persons per km2 are not uncommon here; this contrasts with densities frequently of 150 or less in the teff and maize-sorghum agro-ecologies of the country. And finally, there is relatively greater sensitivity to the environment among enset cultivators in general. The best example of this are the cultivators of the Gamo highlands who employ terracing, irrigation, green and animal manuring, social forestry and skillful crop rotation -all indigenous practices- as part of an environmentally-responsible farming strategy (Jackson et al., Jackson 1970a, b). As was noted above, the enset system is an intensive production system, but what do we mean by that? The literature on agricultural intensification is quite extensive (see Burton and White), however there is no consensus on what the concept means or involves. The most common and the earliest meaning refers to the abandonment or shortening of fallow. Another meaning puts the emphasis on greater inputs of labor, while a third approach regards any practice that leads to increases in crop yield as intensification. I find all these unsatisfactory. Intensification should be viewed instead as integrated production practices aimed at the optimal use of available resources. Intensification may lead to increases in productivity - this is, for instance, how the subject is often viewed in the context of rice culture in Asia (see Bray; Geertz); on the other hand, intensification may be employed as a means of maintaining existing levels of production, particularly under growing shortages of essential assets. This is the sense in which we shall employ the concept here. In our case, intensification is primarily a response to demographic pressure and resource scarcity. In the context of the enset zone, intensification involves the following: a) greater labor input, and year-round cultivation of the land; b) greater integration ofcattle raising and crop cultivation; c) greater reliance on organic matter for conservation and improving soil fertility; and d) greater diversification of crops; in Wollaita in particular this involves the integration of root crops with cereals. Intensive production systems often benefit from or give rise to indigenous technological improvements. Irrigation and water management in rice culture Asia is one good example. In our case, organic fertilization and conservation is an indigenous technology of comparable significance; without organic soil management the enset system would have suffered irreparable damage long ago. The technology involves the skillful use of animal manure, green manure, traditional forms of compost, ash and household waste, and, as in some parts of the Gamo highlands, "night soil", as a means of improving productivity and protecting soil resources. 25</page><page sequence="4">Enset agriculture is however undergoing a serious decline, which, if not arrested in some way, will have fatal consequences for the population concerned. Unlike rice cultivators in Asia, who somehow manage to increase crop yield even with decreasing mini-holdings, peasants in the enset zone barely manage to maintain production levels, and this with great inputs of labor and greater self-exploitation. It may be argued that this in itself is a worthy achievement in view of the extraordinary circumstances, but the economic and demographic burden hanging over the region is much too heavy to be contained by existing levels of production. The crisis in question has certainly been exacerbated by class and state exploitation in the last half century or so, nevertheless, its real causes must be sought in the inherent characteristics, the internal logic as it were, of the enset system itself. This paper will attempt to discuss the resilience and vulnerability of the enset system and the crisis it is presently undergoing from essentially an "internalist" perspective. Resilience of the Enset System Dynamics of Wollaita Agriculture I have examined the nature of Wollaita agriculture in some detail elsewhere (Dessalegn 1992), hence I shall treat the subject only briefly here. One of the striking features of Wollaita, at least to the first-time visitor, is its greenery: gentle landscapes covered with plant growth, and close packed homesteads each surrounded with bushes, crops, grass and trees. This is the impression one comes away with travelling through many of the enset areas. This greenery however hides immense poverty. The second aspect which will also catch the eye is the individual home plot which looks like a botanical garden filled to bursting point with innumerable plant specimen. Quite possibly, Wollaita grows a greater diversity of crops than any area in the enset zone (see Annex, for example); almost all crops, except cereals, are planted in the home plot and tended with loving care. Information about patterns of land distribution in the past are lacking; however it is generally accepted that land has always been a precious commodity in Wollaita. Travellers who passed through the area at the close of the last century speak with astonishment at the high density of the population and the pressure on the land (see below). There are good reasons to believe that over the decades per capita holdings have grown progressively smaller, so that today as much as two-thirds of peasant households in the area may be described as micro-holders2. My own findings from a 1989 survey in two service cooperatives in Bolosso, a district of Wollaita, 26</page><page sequence="5">show that 45 percent of sampled households held land measuring less than 0.5 hectare; many of these holdings were in fact 0.25 hectare or less. Overall, 67 percent of the sampled households held land less than 1.0 hectare in size, and 28 percent between 1.0 and 2.0 hectares (Dessalegn 1992: 34). For comparison, WADU's survey of Bolosso in 1971 shows that 49 percent of land owners in the district (land owners made up 65 percent of all rural households) held land measuring less than 1.0 hectare, and 30 percent between 1.0 and 2.0 hectares (WADU 1976a: 14). What the land reform did here was to squeeze the upper layer of the rural population, and to expand the bottom layer by distributing tiny plots to the land-hungry and the landless. It may be worth noting for comparative purposes that per capita holdings in Wollaita are larger than those in the Gamo highlands; similarly, the average Wollaita peasant operates larger holdings than his counterpart in a good number of rice-growing countries in southeast Asia (cf. Bray; Geertz). Peasants divide their holdings into three plots: there is the main plot, the home (or garden) plot, and the front yard. In a good number of cases the main plot is just an extension of the home plot; in others, it is separate but never far from the homestead. Here peasants grow maize, teff ' barley, legumes, tubers, and ginger if there is a good market for it. The plot is frequently divided into small strips, each growing a particular crop. Peasants who rent land from others may have to walk some distance to reach their rented plots, otherwise fragmentation of plots involving extended travelling is uncommon. On occasions, the boundary between the main and garden plots is planted with trees of one sort or another. We have already noted what the garden plot looks like; here enset , tubers, coffee and fruit trees, vegetables and spices are planted. Some work may be done here by women who otherwise are largely uninvolved in farm work. The front yard looks at first glance unused. It is covered with grass and stretches outward in front of the house; the bigger the front yard, the more established and prosperous its owner. It is used for many purposes: cattle are tethered here for grazing; trees are planted on the sides providing shade, wood products and leaf fall. In addition, smaller plants are grown around the front yard or as fencing on the sides of the house. The yard is also important for ceremonial and social occasions: it is here that friends and relatives meet to celebrate happy occasions, to resolve disputes, to exchange information, etc. We should note in this connection the importance of tree planting in Wollaita. There are two traditional practices which indicate how strongly peasants value trees. First is the practice of passing down trees from one generation to another; a father may bequeath the trees he or his father has planted to his heirs, and usually these are long maturing species. Secondly, customary "tree tenure" acknowledges rights of tree ownership separate from land ownership; a peasant may own trees planted on land over which he has no rights of ownership. 27</page><page sequence="6">Ens et and the tubers planted in Wollaita are vegetati vely propagated. Enseî in particular needs to be transplanted several times, depending on local practices, tended carefully in its early years, with sufficient application of organic fertilizer, and harvested at the right time at maturity9. The wide difference between enset and cereal agriculture with regard to labor requirements, know-how and the technology in use is obvious from this. Root crop cultivation in general does not require plow technology, all work can be carried out with the help of simple hand tools; this is also true of traditional wet rice cultivation in China and the Far East (Bray; Geertz). In fact, it was not until perhaps the second half of the nineteenth century that peasants in the enset zone adopted plow technology, and even today there are places here where the main farm implement is still the hoe or the digging stick (personal observation; Raya). I noted earlier that enset is a strategic or "determining" crop. By this I mean that as considerations of food security determine cropping strategies, enset as the main staple of the household will figure prominently and dominate the farming cycle. If the household has sufficient enset plants established it will plant crops which have high market value, and these include teff ' barley, legumes and ginger. If, on the other hand, this is not the case, cash crops will be curtailed in preference for food crops. The household diet, it should be noted, does not consist of enset alone; a diet solely made up of enset is not only intolerably monotonous but is considered by local tradition (and by available nutritional surveys) harmful to health as well (Kefale and Sandford; Selinus 1971). The diet is supplemented by maize, pulses, tubers, vegetables, dairy products, and occasionally meat. Nevertheless, culturally and psychologically, it is the number of enset plants available to the household and their stages of maturity that will determine the household's decision regarding crop diversification and crop-mix in each particular season. What makes the matter more complicated is that an enset plant matures between five to seven years in some areas, four to six in others, depending on agronomic, ecological, and other factors as well as cultural preferences, and thus enset- based cropping strategies have to take into account both long and short term considerations. There is another aspect of enset agriculture that has a bearing also on land use. The great advantage of root crops4 over cereals is that a household in the enset zone requires much less land to produce its basic food requirements - either root crops alone or a combination of roots and cereals- than one in the cereal zone. In general, root crops have a higher caloric yield per unit of land than such cereals as wheat and barley (FAO, Terry). Put another way, a unit of land in the enset zone can nourish more people than the same unit of land in the cereal zone. I have argued in an earlier work that some 10 percent of the arable land of Bolosso could be sufficient to provide basic sustenance for the population if root crops were its only source of food (Dessalegn 1992). An early study of the Gamo highlands shows that 28</page><page sequence="7">enset plants took between 6 to 10 percent of the cultivated land in the area (Jackson et al.)3- Similarly, Asian wet-rice systems support much greater population densities than European or African dry-grain systems (Bray). This brings me to the question of the integration of root crops with cereals, which, as noted earlier, is characteristic of Wollaita agriculture. The peasant here plants crops from both categories in such combination as to serve his basic food or marketing requirements depending on the circumstances at a given time. Planting of the different class of crops is carried out in such a way as to provide sequential harvests at regular intervals, i.e., one crop maturing and harvested some time after another. This means that the land is continually worked and that it never rests. While sole cropping is the main form employed in many parts of the awraja , peasants also resort to sequential cropping and inter-cropping. Occasionally, a peasant may harvest a crop before it is fully ready and hang it out in the open air to mature; this clears the land earlier for planting of other crops. A household's main plot is divided into several strips on each of which different crops are grown. In this way, the agricultural calendar extends almost for the whole of the year. Combining root crop and cereal cultivation has many advantages; first, it minimizes risk, and secondly it provides families with sources of food almost all year round. The lean months in this system are (under normal circumstances) shorter and fewer than those in the cereal zone (Dessalegn 1992 for more discussion on this). Let us now turn to crop diversification. As noted above, Wollaita peasants grow a wide diversity of crops. The variety of crops grown by the six peasants in the Annex covers almost all the main plants grown in Wollaita as a whole. A closer look will reveal an interesting but significant fact, namely that the poor are just as keen, if not more so, to diversify as the well-to-do. The smaller the operated holding, the more crop varieties it carries. This has a bearing on population and the carrying capacity of the land. As Geertz and Braudel point out, wet rice cultivation responds favorably to intensification of labor. Geertz's micro-farmers in Java, for example, could "squeeze just a little more" from even the tiniest patch of paddy field by means of "more careful, fine-comb cultivation techniques". Here, it seems, one can indefinitely improve crop yield with more work and more labor, and, as Geertz notes, the "capacity of most [rice fields] to respond to loving care is amazing" (: 35). In the language of the economists, the marginal productivity of labor in rice cultivation does not appear to decline, or declines very slowly. Hence, there could be more mouths to feed so long as there are more hands to labor (see Bray). In enset agriculture in contrast, there is a limit beyond which any additional labor will have no positive contribution on productivity. I believe this limit has been reached in Wollaita and in many of the enset areas as suggested above. Hence greater crop 29</page><page sequence="8">diversification and year round cultivation of the land are the twin formula employed to absorb the impact of the growing population. There is another aspect of Wollaita polyculture which is also significant. The greater the minisculization of operated holdings, the greater the emphasis given to diversification in favor of root crops; obviously the main advantage here is space economy. While comparative data are not available, there are strong indications that sweet potato and taro in particular have grown in importance in many areas of the awraja in recent decades, because, in addition to their other advantages, both plants can grow in adverse conditions and require limited labor (cf. Simon 1992). However, Wollaita, Irish and "Galla" potato and yam are also actively planted. Until recently, cassava was considered a famine plant specially in the more moist environments of Bolosso, but it appears it is now shedding its "backward crop" image as it is being planted by more and more peasants (FARM 1993). It is regularly grown and consumed in the lower, drier parts of Wollaita (FARM 1992a, b). Livestock are not only important as traction power, sources of cash and food, but they also provide the resource critical to the enset system, namely manure. Traditional livestock management practices are very effective, and women play an important role in this activity. Livestock are kept in the house for safe-keeping, shelter, and protection against flies and insects. They are often tethered and grazed in the front yard, with trees on the yard providing shade. Since common pasture is scarce, herding is not a frequent practice. Livestock are often fed crop residue, grass, leaf fall and mineral licks. There are two aspects of livestock raising which are significant. The more livestock a peasant has the better his chances of increased production (through better access to manure), of higher income (through kotta farming - see Annex), and marketing of dairy produce. On the other hand, in conditions of land shortage and pasture scarcity, it is costly to raise livestock. Livestock also compete for scarce resources which are needed elsewhere: crop residue, leaf fall and grass are not only in short supply but are also needed for organic conservation. More livestock means more feed, hence reduced resources for green manuring. Indeed, such is the shortage of feed that many peasants are driven to buy grass to feed their animals, particularly in the dry season (Adugna 1990). On the other hand, less livestock means less manure, less crop production, and less income from animal products. These contradictory demands are resolved in two ways: by means of livestock trading, and by livestock leasing or "share-rearing" arrangements. Peasants here are active in livestock marketing: a peasant works his ox for a few years, 30</page><page sequence="9">[aliens it anu sells it when cattle prices are high. He "buys a bull, trains and works it until it is time to sell it again. This continual turnover generates income and saves on plant residue. The other practice involves acquiring cattle from a well-to-do peasant on loan and tending them for a given length of time. The poor peasant gets the manure and shares in the milk product, and the owner of the cattle saves on the cost of upkeep of the animals. As the most important element of green technology, manure is highly prized. A household which has enough livestock to produce manure sufficient for its fields is a prosperous one. Enset , sweet potato, taro and maize do well with organic fertilizer, whereas teff ' barley and legumes respond better to chemical fertilizer. Crop rotation techniques as a form of conservation are less sophisticated here than in the Gamo highlands. Organic technology is safe, and virtually every peasant knows how to use it, nevertheless it is a limiting technology suitable mainly for small cultivators. Organic soil management is viable and successful essentially on small plots such as those worked by the poor and the lower middle strata of the Wollaita peasantry. Large plots require large amounts of manure, which in turn require large herds. Thus, because of the scarcity of manure, a considerable amount of what is available is used on enset groves: the favorite crop, in other words, gets most of the prized resource. Enset , tubers, cereals, livestock; organic soil management; year round cultivation: these are the elements of Wollaita's intensive agriculture. The system is made up of a chain of delicately linked activities, but the anchor, as it were, which holds the system together and gives it resiliency is enset cultivation. A serious damage to enset will disturb the system and may lead to catastrophic consequences. Vulnerability of the Enset System Crisis of Wollaita Agriculture Wollaita suffered a major famine in 1984/85, perhaps its first famine experience in at least a century. In contrast, Wollo and Tigrai, part of the teff culture of the north, have suffered more than five major famines in the same period. The peasants who live in the lowlands of the awraja , who depend on livestock raising, have frequently been victims of drought, but starvation has always been held at bay for enset cultivators in the highlands. The famine of 1973/74, which was confined to the teff and maize-sorghum ecologies, did ripple through Wollaita bringing hardship to the poor and marginal elements, but Wollaita in general was not declared a famine area at the time. The same is true of many other enset areas. RRC mission reports of Kambatta, Gurageland, and Sidamo province in 1974 and 1975 show that the hard 31</page><page sequence="10">hit areas were predominantly in the drier lowlands. The main enset cultivators in the higher altitudes in all three regions did itót face serious crisis, though some communities were said to have suffered harvest shortfalls, loss of livestock and general hardship due to poor rains in the earlier years (RRC). The 1984/85 crisis in Wollaita was however famine in the full sense of the word, and several thousand lives are thought to have been lost in the disaster (Adhana 1988). I submit that the primary factor which triggered the famine was not really drought, though there was a dry spell at the time, but the destruction of the enset plant by crop disease. In normal years, rainfall in highland Wollaita is ample and reliable, and on occasions it may even rain all year round. In 1984, in contrast, precipitation in central Wollaita occurred for only six months of the year as opposed to the average of eight to nine months (cf. Belay 1992). The disease in question, bacterial wilt , appeared in the closing years of the 1970s, but extension agents were unable to provide any protection against it. By the early 1980s, it had spread to many parts of the awraja and was wrecking havoc on enset plantations. Peasants eradicated whole groves of contaminated plants to check the progress of the disease, and used the surviving ones as sources of suckers for propagation. The extent of damage was catastrophic, specially for poor and middling peasants many of whom are believed to have lost all or most of their enset plants. For our purposes the famine is significant for two main reasons: first it confirms the "strategic" place of enset in Wollaita agriculture; peasants were exposed to danger when their enset groves were destroyed, though we should note that matters were made worse by the failure of the rains at the time. Secondly, the famine revealed the vulnerability of the enset system. Without significant inflows of food aid the tragedy would have been far worse than it was. As soon as conditions appeared to return to normal, peasants were eager to build up their enset stock, and the lack of planting material drove many to obtain clones from Kambatta to replace those they had lost. I have so far said very little about rural poverty, not because it is insignificant but because it is on the contrary the most pressing problem in Wollaita. The subject, however, is too involved to be covered adequately in the short space at my disposal. I will thus have to confine myself to highlight some aspects of the problem as it now exists. Though accurate figures are hard to come by, it may be estimated on the basis of available micro-studies that more than half the population of the awraja is suffering froiii chronic poverty. Because of the nature of property devolution (see below), and the expanding demographic trend, it is quite certain that the magnitude of poverty will continue to grow from year to year. The poor often have tiny plots 32</page><page sequence="11">which they may be unable to farm themselves and which they rent to others for a share of the harvest. They own virtually no livestock, and only the fortunate ones among them have access to rented animals. Needless to say, without animals and animal manure a household is severely handicapped in growing its staple food. The poor have large families, perhaps eight to nine per household, and a large number of non-working dependents. Polygyny is common among the poor, and while one of the reasons for it is to gain access to more land, the end result is often greater burdens on all of the co-wives involved (Dessalegn 1992). Poor peasants are often burdened with debt and have few chances of off-farm employment. At present, the main form of earning supplementary income is through petty trading. Many peasants now double up as itinerant traders, travelling frequently to the weekly markets selling agricultural goods, handicraft products, livestock and dairy produce. Poor peasants are dis ~ antaged here too since many of them cannot afford the initial investment. I sL Ad note here that the poorest of the poor are women-headed households. Poor peasants not only have fewer enset plants but fewer maturing ones due to the practice of premature harvesting. On occasions, poor peasants will sell their young plants to others who need them for propagation purposes. Though the evidence is not conclusive, I submit that premature harvesting of enset is forced on peasants by serious poverty and food insecurity - households simply cannot wait out the full maturation cycle. Insecurity of tenure, of production and settlement, and disease hazard which has become more frequent since the late 1970s, are also contributing factors. A recent paper on the age structure of enset plantations in three communities in North Omo (Tibebu et al. 1993) notes that premature harvesting is very frequent in Wollaita and the Gamo highlands, and as a consequence the existing age structure of plantations here is highly tapered, with a great number of plants in the young age bracket, and only a few in that of the maturing. The study does not take into account the recent large-scale loss of enset in Wollaita due to bacterial wilt, and hence the sociological aspect of the problem cannot be examined (see also Kefale and Sandford). Conditions in the rural areas today are in fapt turning from the critical to the explosive. Landlessness is growing at a rapid rate, and to the previous claimants to land, viz. young peasants who had joined the Peasant Associations (PAs) and have long been on the waiting list for land allocations, one should add ex-Derg soldiers and returnees from resettlement. It has been over eight to ten years since PAs stopped apportioning land to new claimants because there was no land available for distribution. Young peasants were deprived, and the most fortunate among them continue to work on the land of their parents, which puts great pressure on family resources. Wollaita provided a high number of young men to the Derg army, and many of these soldiers have now returned to their rural homes. In response to the 33</page><page sequence="12">new government's appeals, but more importantly to diffuse social tension, PAs allocated plots to returning soldiers in 1992, but as what was distributed was marginal land many recipients benefitted very little. PAs gave priority to the soldiers because of high rates of violent crime which spread through the rural areas following the fall of the Derg, and which peasants attributed to the soldiers, some of whom were still heavily armed. On the other hand, young peasants already on the waiting list for allotments, unhappy for having been neglected, are putting pressure on the beleaguered PAs (on current land matters, see Bruce, Hoben and Dessalegn 1993). Let us now turn to demographic matters. Population densities in the arable parts of Wollaita may reach 400 persons per km2. All the evidence suggests that the population of the awraja has been increasing at a fairly high rate for a long time, and this has put immense pressure on available resources. More population has meant more land taken out of pasture, less cattle, which in turn has meant less manure. Cattle manure which is the life line of Wollaita agriculture is now in short supply. This is all the more critical because the practice of continuous cultivation of the land without either the benefit of chemical fertilizer or with insufficient organic matter will accelerate the exhaustion of the soil. Persistent complaints are heard from peasants in many parts of Wollaita that there is a marked decline in soil fertility due to continuous cultivation and lack of access to organic or chemical fertilizers (FARM 1992b, 1993). In the late 1970s and early 80s, WADU's credit program for chemical fertilizer was eagerly taken up by a large number of peasants, though the main beneficiaries were the well-to-do. At present, due to prohibitively high prices and unreliable delivery, fertilizers are beyond the reach of all but a small portion of the upper peasantry. Continuous cropping may also be responsible for the wide spread of a great variety of crop disease. Pests and diseases such as bacterial wilt, sweet potato butterfly, stalk borer, bollworm, rust, and weevils are now rampant. Coffee berry disease is also widespread and many peasants now complain of losing their coffee trees on account of the disease (FARM 1992, 1993). The great pressure on the land has led to a serious disturbance of the ecological balance, which traditional agriculture had maintained in the past. The lowlands of the awraja , the areas with inadequate moisture levels and more fragile soils are now being occupied by hard - pressed peasants. The farming of hillsides has been going on at least since the 1930s according to oral tradition, and much earlier according to some of the written evidence (Stigand 1910; Hodson 1927). Stigand, who travelled through much of the enset region in 1908 was astonished by the dense population of Wollaita and the crowded rural markets he saw. Hodson, travelling some seven years later, saw settlements and enset gardens on hillsides in central Wollaita. Virtually all the early travellers invariably note that the area was thickly inhabited (Chiatti). The written evidence suggests that by the beginning of 34</page><page sequence="13">this century the natural forest had all but disappeared except on steep mountain slopes, along river valleys and in the dry lowlands. What is striking about the demographic picture is the immobility of the rural population. A household census conducted by CSO in 1965 found that the rural population of Wollaita was 600,000; there was only one town at the time, Soddo, with a population of 8200. The survey has some shortcomings but it is the best attempt at total population count we have for the period. In 1976, WADU estimated that the rural population of the awraja was over 900,000 (1976b: 8-9), however the sources on which the estimate was based, viz. PA registers, are unreliable. The 1984 census, on the other hand, recorded a rural population of 930,000. Soddo had grown to 24,600, partly due to migrations from the rural areas, but there were no other towns with significant population concentrations; both Boditi and Areka, the other towns of note, had populations of less than 5000 each. I should note that these two towns were founded in the 1950s and 1960s. It thus appears that in the space of two decades the rural population of Wollaita had grown by half. It is remarkable that despite high population densities and pressing resource limitations (and contrary to Ester Boserup's-thesis), the enset zone is less urbanized than the two other agro-ecologies noted at the outset of this paper. Limited urbanization, particularly in the face of demographic pressure and scarce resources, is a good indicator of limited population mobility. The following table shows the degree of urbanization in selected enset and cereal areas. Urban Population in Selected Enset and Cereal Zones Enset Areas % Urban Pop. Cereal Areas % Urban Pop. Chebo &amp; Gurage 3.5 Gojjam 8.1 Kembatta &amp; Had 3.3 Arssi 8.0 Wollaita 4.1 Wollo 7.0 Sidama 5.9 Gedeo 7.5 Gamo highlands 2.8 National ave. 11.3 SOURCE : Office of Pop. Housing Census Comm. 1984. 35</page><page sequence="14">It is worth noting that both Gedeo and Sidama have higher rates of urbanization than the other enset areas, and this may well be due to the greater significance of the coffee crop in their economy. The data nevertheless seems to indicate strongly that there is a close connection between low urbanization and enset cultivation. Boserup's argument that the prime condition for urbanization is a sufficiently large and dense rural population appears to be contradicted here. Population immobility may be exacerbated by the absence of alternative forms of livelihood, or by the unwillingness of populations to try new forms of economic activity. Opening up new lands and extending existing agricultural activities is one possibility; however, there are at present no new lands to be opened up which are suitable for enset agriculture. It. is also important to note that the geographical location of many of the enset areas is a confining one: they cannot physically expand partly because each one of them is surrounded by other ť/tfif-cultivating communities which are similarly constrained, and partly because doing so will entail moving to the adjacent lowlands where enset cultivation is unsuitable and the hazard to human and animal health is very high. Resettlement is another option. Government-initiated resettlement schemes of the 1980s have all foiled, and most of the resettlement sites have now been abandoned. The attempt of the Kambatta peasantry, large numbers of whom were sent to Mettekel for resettlement, to transplant enset cultivation to that area was a dismal failure. Yet a third possibility is engaging in new sources of employment. This is what the Gurage have managed to do for many decades: they have left their home areas in large numbers and have taken up trading and related activities mostly in the urban centers outside the enset zone. They have, in other words, abandoned enset agriculture for the lure of commercial activity (Shack). It is noteworthy that few of the communities under discussion have made this form of radical break with enset cultivation. In Wollaita, migration to earn supplementary income is eagerly sought by many peasants. The usual sources of off-farm employment have been the mechanized farms in the neighboring areas, the agro-industrial enterprises in the Awash valley, and, occasionally, coffee plantations in the nearby provinces. Peasants travel to these areas, work for a short time and return home with earned income, which is either invested on the farm or used to cover social expenses. Temporary or oscillatory migration, which is what we have here (and in Kambatta as well), is not an escape from enset agriculture but rather a means of reinforcing it. Only long term or permanent migration can relieve the demographic pressure. As was noted earlier, enset cultivation is reliable, and a small plot of land, even a micro-holding will suffice to provide a measure of food security. It is therefore highly unlikely that a peasant will choose to leave home and face the risk 36</page><page sequence="15">of insecurity, unemployment and destitution elsewhere. It is, on the contrary, safer to stay on the farm, working the land however small it may be. In other words, peasants are deterred from long-term or permanent migration not only because of the fear of the unknown but also because of the certainty of the home environment. I should note too that families plant enset not just for now or this year but for several years ahead. Of course, the poorer a peasant the less he can plan on a long term basis; nevertheless, even a poor household has enset plants if not sufficient for many years at least maturing in sequence over a period of time. Let us not forget, either, that even a poor household will have some enset-io od stored in the ground undergoing fermentation. The storage period of enset before it is consumed varies from several weeks to several months (on occasions extending to a year or more) depending on the economic status of the household, its access to alternative sources of food, and ecological factors. The more well-to-do a family is the more enset-iooá it has stored in the ground, and the more secure it will be in the months (or even years) ahead. All this adds to the retentive power of the enset system. Indeed, it may even be said that the system lures back errant migrants because of the promise of food security it offers. .Population mobility and dynamics may be stimulated or arrested by inheritance systems and customary practices of property devolution. The subject of inheritance and property transfer is a complicated one and will take us too far from pur objective. The following observation is sufficient for our purposes: there is general agreement that partible inheritance (the division of the family property among several heirs), as opposed to impartible inheritance (the transfer of property, undivided, to a single heir), is likely to promote: a) restricted population mobility; b) high population density; and c) polygyny, if the exclusion of women from inheritance is the rule (vid. Goody 1976, Goody et al. 1976). In Wollaita and a number of the communities in the enset zone, partible inheritance is the rule, and the heirs are always male siblings; female siblings are excluded from inheritance, and as a general rule women do not customarily own land except as custodians for their sons (see Olmstead for Gamo, and Hamer for Sidama). The Gurage in contrast are somewhat of an exception; inheritance rules do not fall into the purely partible or purely impartible tradition (Shack 1966). Partible inheritance gives rise to population immobility because children, i.e. male children, will be reluctant to migrate out because of the certainty of succeeding to a share of the family's property, however small this may be; female children stay primarily because they have no other choice. Often, to inherit land, male off-spring will have to set up a household and enter into marriage. In Wollaita, children frequently inherit only after marriage, and marriage often occurs in young age. Thus high rates of marriage and high birth rates follow as a consequence. In 37</page><page sequence="16">addition, birth rates may grow higher where polygyny is also practised, as is the case in Wollaita and many of the communities in the enset zone. Moreover, the practice of pre-mortem inheritance (the transfer of property to heirs during the life time of the parents), which again is common in enset areas, virtually ties the new generation to the farm and the rural world as each male sibling becomes endowed with part of the family estate at marraige. Partible inheritance is relatively egalitarian because it is based on the equal treatment of all (male) children, but it promotes the dissipation of the family property. The land, in other words, is divided among heirs each of whom will end up with only a portion of it. In contrast, impartible inheritance is discriminatory because property is transferred to a single heir, but its advantage is thé preservation of the integrity of the property in question. The same piece of land is transferred, in its entirety, from generation to generation. The first form of inheritance promotes the progressive diminution of land, the second its consolidation. In the case of Wollaita, each new generation starts out, as a rule, poorer than its predecessor. The micro-holdings that we see today are the end product of successive subdivisions set in train by customary rules of inheritance. Contemporary developments, in particular the radical policies of the military regime, may have accelerated the process of diminution, but they did not initiate it. On the other hand, customary land transfer practices accept land sale and purchase as legitimate options. This is a recognition that successive subdivisions lead to uneconomic fields; an opportunity is thus offered through the land market to reverse the process and promote reconsolidation. In the period before the Revolution, there was a small but active land market in Wollaita; however most of the fields that changed hands through purchase were small plots. WADU's survey of Bolosso noted above shows that while among owner households 85 percent acquired their land through inheritance and 5 percent through purchase, among owner-tenant households 25 percent acquired their land through purchase. At present, land sales are illegal and information about the matter is difficult to get but it is not unusual to find holders of tiny plots who have leased out their land on long term bases; occasionally one meets a peasant or two who admit selling their land due to extreme hardship. In conclusion, I submit that the reasons for the immobility of the population in Wollaita and in the enset zone as a whole must be sought in enset agriculture itself and not in processes and factors external to it. The inherent retentive power of the enset system, which as we saw is enormous, has been reinforced by the existing mode of property devolution which, with a few exceptions, is uniform in its substansive aspects throughout the enset zone. 38</page><page sequence="17">Let us now turn to medical history. The dense settlement pattern which is typical of the enset zone, and the congestion of living space which this involves, has been a factor in the frequency of large-scale as well as localized epidemics in the enset zone. As noted above, peasant homesteads are surrounded by rich plant growth, and such plant growth frequently serves as breeding ground for disease vectors such as mosquitoes. The medical history of Wollaita has not been sufficiently investigated, but all the indications we have suggest that the population here has been the victim of wide-spread health crises more frequently than comparable communities outside the enset zone. Peasants in Wollaita have been subject to periodic outbreaks of devastating pandemics, of which the main ones in the period between the 1930s and 1980s include small-pox, typhus, malaria, yellow fever, cholera, and meningitis. According to oral informants, serious epidemics of small -pox and typhus hit Bolosso and the adjacent areas killing innumerable people, and forcing some to flee to the high mountain retreats in the first half of the 1930s. The 1957-58 malaria epidemic, said to be the worst in Africa, affected some three million people in the densely populated areas of the country, mostly in the woyna degga and degga environments. The epidemic, which public health officials initially mistook for typhus or relapsing fever, quite probably swept through Wollaita though we unfortunately know little of its impact (Fontaine et al.). One of my informants on Wollaita medical history believes that there was a devastating outbreak of what he calls "ye-tinfash beshita" (disease transmitted by breath) which spread through Wollaita and Kambatta in 1957 killing many people; this coincides with the malaria epidemic that Fontaine and others have written about, but we do not know whether the two events are one and the same6. The early 1960s saw most of Bolosso and the lower altitudes of the awraja devastated by yellow fever, again said to be one of the worst outbreaks of its kind in Africa. The epidemic is said to have travelled up the Omo valley and may have affected over a million people in the country (Serie). The most active breeding ground of the mosquito vector was the leaves and stem of enset and taro plants, and this explains why much of the enset zone was seriously affected. While in the rest of the country the epidemic lasted from 1960 to 1962, it did not work itself out in Wollaita until 1964. The 1970s were also difficult years for the peasantry here because of repeated outbreaks of cholera (vid. Stock). In the late 1980s, coming soon on the heels of the famine, a meningitis epidemic swept through much of Wollaita. The epidemic, which was preceded by a malaria outbreak in the lower altitudes, started in the last quarter of 1988 and was not finally brought under control until the middle of 1989. In early 1989, nearly two-thirds of the rural population, mçn and women in the 2 to 30 year age bracket, were said to be at risk. The epidemic was mostly confined to the enset growing areas of Sidamo, Gamo Goffa and southern Shoa. The attack rate was believed to 39</page><page sequence="18">be 200 per 100,000 population, and while the actual death toll will probably never be known, there is reason to believe that it was very high7. In between these large-scale pandemics were localized outbreaks of disease often attacking children and those suffering from malnutrition. It is known for instance that in 1983 there was a localized outbreak of relapsing fever in central Wollaita, with nearly 700 deaths reported (Zein and Kloos: Ch 13). Furthermore, in the period November 1988 to October 1989, and again in the same period in 1990-91, there were exceptionally high rates of child mortality in the rural areas. According to the evidence, the cause of the disaster on both occasions was probably an outbreak of disease; anthropomorphic measurements taken at the time did not reach below the threshold deemed to indicate severe malnutrition and to require emergency assistance. Mortality figures for each of the two years are shown to be almost twice as high as the national average (SCF 1992, Lawrence 1994). Finally, localized and small-scale epidemics of typhus, cholera and malaria are not uncommon in the awraja. Conclusion Such in brief have been the causes which have contributed to the decline and present crisis of enset agriculture, at least in its setting in Wollaita. The enset system today is paying the price of its successes in the past. It may be worth noting here that WADU's long-term development strategy for Wollaita, prepared in the mid-1970s, was to de-emphasize root crop cultivation in favor of a combination of cash crop and cereal cultivation; parallel with this was the expansion of settlement schemes in the lowland areas where cotton cultivation was quite rewarding. The agency vigorously promoted coffee, chili pepper, cotton and teff as lucrative cash crops, and maize, barley and teff as substitute food crops (Dessalegn 1992). Whether this strategy would have succeeded if the agency had been allowed to pursue its plans in the 1980s and beyond is of course a moot question. However, the experiment is an interesting one, and many peasants did respond favorably to the idea of diversification into cash cropping. Significantly enough, root crops were not abandoned or de-emphasized by peasants but on the contrary the "new" cash crops were integrated into the existing cropping system. In the work noted at the opening of this paper, Braudel observes that rice is a tyrannical crop and has imprisoned its cultivators in China through its arduous labor requirements, and its dominance as a food crop. "In the last resort," he points out, "the China of the paddy fields represents the triumph of a peasantry turned in upon itself" (: 155). I believe the same may be said of enset cultivation. Enset has similarly imprisoned its peasantry 'yith its promises of resilience in the face of natural stress, its space economy, its undemanding labor requirements and the 40</page><page sequence="19">security it has often provided. The "triumph" of enset cultivation can now be seen in the demographic mountain it has managed to throw up, and the systemic crisis it has, unwittingly, brought upon itself. Agricultural intensification, the primary response of peasants to resource scarcity and population pressure, has failed to arrest the intensification of competition for resources and the acceleration of demographic expansion. Moreover, while in the past population growth may have stimulated change and adaptability in the enset system, the immense demographic pressure on the land today is unlikely to induce technical progress, and may in fact drive the system towards technological regression. Already, in some areas of the enset zone, ox -plowing has been replaced by hoe tillage on account of the inaccessibility of farm oxen and the decreasing size of farm plots. Here too, the similarities between enset and wet-rice systems are striking. As Geertz and Bray have argued, the tiny farm units typical of rice cultivation often discouraged technical progress, placing a high premium instead on the intensive application of skilled (and frequently family) labor. Contrary to Boserup, there is a point beyond which any population increase not accompanied by significant out-migration fails to stimulate change and improvements, and becomes instead a handicap. I believe this critical point has been reached in Wollaita as well as in Kambatta, the Gamo highlands, and some of the other communities in the enset zone. As in Braudel's China and Geertz's Java, peasant society in Wollaita is thus retreating inward and closing in upon itself. Enset agriculture, in brief, is in urgent need of a sound and long term solution, a solution which must bring about a transformation of the enset system, leading it towards something new and more dynamic. Notes * This is a revised version of a paper presented at the First International Workshop on Enset held at the Institute of Agricultural Research, Addis Ababa, 13-20 December 1993. 1. The literature on enset agriculture is quite unimpressive. I have included in the bibliography all works on the subject I had access to. The literature on Wollaita agriculture is limited, but see, Dessalegn (1992), FARM Africa, Getahun et al., Kefale and Sandford, NORAGRIC, and WADU. For the Gamo highlands, see Jackson, Jackson et al., Olmstead and Shigeta. For the Gurage, Gebreyessus and Shack. For the Sidama, Eshetu, Fantaye, Hamer, Raya, and Smeds. 41</page><page sequence="20">For rice culture in Asia see Braudel, Bray and Geertz. 2. Our main sources on land distribution before the Revolution are WADU 1976a; post Revolution works on the subject are Dessalegn 1984, 1992; Getahun et al.; FARM 1993. WADU (Wollaita Agricultural Development Unit), an IDA-financed development agency, promoted improved farming practices, provided input credit, built rural roads and environmental protection schemes in the 1970s. 3. On the propagation and cultivation of ens et, and the many uses of the plant, see Kefale and Sandford 1991. 4. I have used the term root crops to include tubers also. Strictly speaking, root crops refer to enset and cassava, and tubers to taro, yam, sweet potato, and the potato family (vid. FAO, Terry). 5. The question of how many enset plants are enough for a family has been debated since Smeds (1955) first mooted the subject. According to him, 3 enset plants are sufficient for an adult for a year. Shack thought an adult needed 10 plants a year. WADU' s estimate is that 40-60 plants are required by a family of upto 6 persons in a year, thus more or less supporting Shack. Kefale and Sandford (1991: 27-31) are more cautious. The problem is complicated because the family diet includes other food items. 6. For the major diseases and recent epidemic occurrences in Ethiopia, see Schaller and Kuls 1972, and Zein and Kloos 1988. My main informant on Wollaita medical history was Ato Afework G. Selassie, a noted traditional doctor and oral historian who lives in Bolosso (see Bureau 1990). 7. The Ministry of Health officials in Wollaita tried to cover up the meningitis epidemic, and it was not until considerable deaths had occurred that they finally appealed to NGOs in the area for medical help. My information comes from UN EPPG sources. 42</page><page sequence="21">ANNEX Case Study of Six Peasants, Bolosso (Wollaita) 1973/74 Case 1. Rich Peasant. Sixty years old; Orthodox Christian.

Adapted from Agri-Service 1974: 26-30. The document says the six peasants were selected from a random sample of 30, and were considered "representative families". All six were said to be not literate. Though not stated here, WADU initially attracted well-to-do peasants who were eager to get access to chemical fertilizer. The last four peasants probably were not WADU members. NOTES . 1. Kotta is a local share-cropping arrangement, often involving sharing the harvest equally between land owner and share-cropper. 2. It is common in Wollaita for one farm animal to be owned by two or three persons. 3. The main varieties of potato are Irish, Wollaita and Galla potato. Though not mentioned here, garden peas are common in Bolosso; other legumes include cowpeas, soybeans and haricot beans. 4. Cotton cultivation in the settlement area of Abbela was quite lucrative at the time. This is where the peasant wanted to get land, and he raised the money to bribe the officials involved. In Bele9, another settlement area, cassava, and in Abbela, chickpeas were also grown. COMMENT. Here is a snapshot of a rural community in Bolosso, showing land tenure dynamics, social differentiation, crop diversification and food security strategies. The "picture" was taken exactly twenty years ago, and, in many ways very little has changed since then. Thanks to the land reform of 1975, the landlord has of course disappeared, so has the institution of tenancy. WADU suffered an unnatural death in 1983. In terms of size of land holdings, the gap between the rich and the poor has narrowed, not because the latter are better off but because the former lost land due to redistribution. But share-cropping is still actively pursued, and everyone is poorer than before. 44</page><page sequence="23">BIBLIOGRAPHY NOTE : Following customary usage, Ethiopian authors are listed by first name.
