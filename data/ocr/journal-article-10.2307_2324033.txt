<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphic Polygons GODFRIED TOUSSAINT School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada We are concerned with a very special type of polygon in the Euclidean plane E2 referred to as a simple (also Jordan) polygon. For any integer n ? 3, we define a polygon or n-gon in the Euclidean plane E2 as the figure P = [x1, x2, ..., xn] formed by n points x1, x2,..., xn in E2 and n line segments [xi, xi+1], i = 1, 2, . . ., n - 1, and [xn, x1]. The points xi are called the vertices of the polygon and the line segments are termed its edges. DEFINITION. A polygon P is called a simple polygon provided the only points of the plane that belong to two edges of P are the vertices of P. A simple polygon has a well defined interior and exterior. We will follow the convention of including the interior of a polygon when referring to P. DEFINITION (Meisters [Me2]). A vertex xi of P is called a principal vertex provided the diagonal [xi_ 1, xi 1] intersects the boundary of P only at xi_ 1 and xi+ l. DEFINITION (Meisters [Mel]). A principal vertex xi of a simple polygon P is called an ear if the diagonal [xi-1, xi+1] that bridges xi lies entirely in P. We say that two ears xi and xj are nonoverlapping if int[ xi - 1, xi, xi + 1 ] n int[ xj - 1, xj, xj + 1 ] = 0. The following Two-Ears Theorem was recently proved by Meisters [Mel]. THEOREM 1 (the Two-Ears Theorem, Meisters [Mel]). Except for triangles every simple polygon P has at least two nonoverlapping ears.</page><page sequence="2">32 GODFRIED TOUSSAINT [January Meisters' proof by induction is both elegant and concise. However, given that a simple polygon can always be triangulated allows a one-sentence proof [O'R]. Leaves in the dual-tree of the triangulated polygon correspond to ears and every tree of two or more nodes must have at least two leaves. This theorem is quite applicable in many situations. For example it establishes that there exists a stepwise procedure for "shrinking" a polygon P down to a triangle by deleting a vertex at each step, say xi, and inserting [xi-1, xi+1 ] in the place of [xi-1, xi, xi ] while ensuring that at each step we retain a simple polygon P'. In actual fact, of course, we need only a "one ear" theorem to carry out such a procedure. The method is evident: locate an ear in P and "cut it off," then locate an ear in the remaining polygon of one less vertex and cut it off, and continue this process until the remaining polygon is a triangle. It is obvious that such a procedure could also be used as an algorithm for computing a triangulation of P. However care must be taken in converting this idea into an efficient algorithm. A straightforward approach of implementing this notion can result in a very slow algorithm. To determine if a vertex is or is not an ear may take O(n) steps and we may have to visit O(n) vertices to find and cut off an ear. Therefore, using a "brute force" approach we may have to perform O(n2) steps to cut off an ear and O(n3) steps to completely triangulate P in this manner, On the other hand, algorithms exist for triangulating simple polygons in time O(n log n) [GJPT] and O(n log log n) [TV]. Once a triangulation is obtained the dual-tree can be deter- mined in O(n) time. Finally, an O(n)-time tree-traversal can prune off one leaf from the dual-tree at each step resulting in the cutting off of one ear from P at each step. It remains one of the most outstanding problems in computational geometry to determine if an O(n) time algorithm exists for triangulating arbitrary simple polygons. One question that arises is whether the "inverse" of the previous procedure is possible, i.e., does there always exist a stepwise procedure for "inflating" a simple polygon P until it is "'as fat-as-possible " by deleting vertices from P one-at-a-time so that at each step we retain a simple polygon? We answer this question in the affirmative by proving that every non-convex polygon contains at least one mouth, but first we must define mouth and make more precise what we mean by "as-fat-as-possible." DEFINITION. A principal vertex xi of a simple polygon P is called a mouth if the diagonal [xi-1, xi+1] is an external diagonal, i.e., the interior of [xi1, xi+1] lies in the exterior of P. The convex hull of a simple polygon P will be denoted by CH(P). The boundary (bd) of CH(P) is a convex polygon. We now have a precise definition of "as-fat-as-possible," i.e., P is inflated until it becomes the convex hull of P. THEOREM 2 (the One-Mouth Theorem). Except for convex polygons every simple polygon P has at least one mouth. Proof. Construct the convex hull CH(P). Since P is non-convex there must exist edges on bd(CH(P)) that are not edges of P. Each such edge forms the "lid" of a "pocket" of CH(P). (Refer to FIG. 1.) We shall prove that in fact every such pocket yields a mouth. Let Ki1 denote the pocket of CH(P) determined by vertices xi and x; of P. Clearly Ki1 = [xi, xi+, ..., xj] u [xj, xi] forms itself a</page><page sequence="3">1991] NOTES 33 _ R~~~~~~~~~X Xj+l r t_ FIG. 1. Illustrating the proof of the One-Mouth Theorem. simple polygon. By the Two-Ears Theorem Kij must have two ears and since they are non-overlapping they cannot both occur at xi and xi, Therefore, at least one ear must occur at Xk for i &lt; k &lt; j. Obviously such an ear for Kij is a mouth for P. Q.E.D. While the above stepwise procedure for "inflating" a polygon P by "gobbling- up" mouths provides an algorithm for computing the convex hull of P this is not the best way to tackle this problem. Triangulating P does not appear to help here and a straightforward approach to "gobbling-up" mouths leads to an 0(n3) time algorithm. On the other hand several 0(n) time algorithms for computing the convex hull of a simple polygon are known [MA], [GY], [To]. It is possible for a polygon to have many ears and only one mouth (FIG. 2(a)) and also many mouths and only one ear (FIG. 2(b)). Note that care is needed when speaking of mouths and ears as well exposed vertices, i.e., vertices of P that are also vertices of CH(P). For example, Guggenheimer [Gu] states that a simple polygon has two principal vertices that are exposed. This is false and a counterex- ample due to Meisters [Me2] is illustrated in FIG. 2(c). This figure also illustrates that polygons exist which have precisely one mouth and two ears. In fact, these notions suggest some interesting families of simple polygons. Recall that no 0(n) time algorithm exists for triangulating an arbitrary simple polygon. However FIG. 2. (a) A polygon with only one FIG. 2.

(c) This polygon has precisely three pnncipal vertices: two ears and one mouth and yet none of them are exposed. certain special classes of simple polygons such as star-shaped ones do admit 0(n) time triangulation [To2]. We now define another such class of polygons. DEFINITION. A simple polygon P is called a one-mouth polygon provided it contains precisely one mouth. DEFINITION. A simple polygon P is called a two-ear polygon provided it contains no more than two ears. DEFINITION. A simple polygon P is called anthropomorphic provided it contains precisely two ears and one mouth. (See FIG. 2(c).) These three classes of polygons exhibit a good deal of structure as exemplified by the following theorem. THEOREM 3. The dual-tree of every triangulation of a two-ear polygon is a chain. Proof. Assume the polygon P has two ears and that the dual tree of some triangulation of P is not a chain. Then the tree must contain at least three leaves which is a contradiction. Q.E.D. Theorem 3 allows us to triangulate the interior of a two-ear polygon of n vertices in 0(n) time as follows. Consider any vertex xi of P. It is an easy matter to find another vertex xi such that [x;, xj] is an internal diameter of P in 0(n) time if indeed such a diagonal exists [Le]. Furthermore if such a diagonal does not exist then the diagonal [xi_1, Xi+ ] is guaranteed to exist [Le]. In either case this diagonal partitions the polygon P into two polygons P1 and P2 each of which can be triangulated in 0(n) time starting at either [xj, xi] or [xi-1, xij1]. It suffices to realize that each diagonal can be inserted with a constant number of local angle tests. A similar procedure can be used to triangulate the exterior of a one-mouth polygon. First we can use an 0(n) time algorithm for finding the convex hull of P [Tol]. This will identify the two vertices xi and xi that form the "lid" of the pocket Kij of CH(P). One of the two ears of Kij must occur at either xi or xj and can then be identified in a constant number of steps (i.e., independent of n). Triangu- lation of Kij can then proceed as in the case of the two-ear polygon. We have therefore established the following theorems.</page><page sequence="5">1991] NOTES 35 THEOREM 4. A one-mouth polygon can be externally triangulated in 0(n) time. THEOREM 5. A two-ear polygon can be internally triangulated in 0(n) time. THEOREM 6. An anthropomorphic polygon can be completely triangulated in 0(n) time. One additional computational problem that is of interest here concerns the recognition of these types of polygons. For example, whether a simple polygon is star-shaped or not can be determined in 0(n) time [LP]. By testing every vertex of a simple polygon to determine whether it is an ear or a mouth we can recognize anthropomorphic polygons in 0(n2) time. However, using a more clever procedure we can reduce this complexity to 0(n) [ST]. Note added in proof: Since the writing of this note Bernard Chazelle at Prince- ton University has shown that arbitrary simple polygons can indeed be triangulated in linear time. REFERENCES [GJPT].
