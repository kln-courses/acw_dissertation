Pp. vi, 255; LANDSCAPE AND MEMORY. By Simon Schama. New York: Alfred Knopf, 1995. Pp. xi, 652. In Metahistory (1973), a landmark study in our present-day historiographical memory, Hayden White updated for a modern audience the ancient claim for the essential role of rhetoric in historical understanding. Since early in the century, historians had tended to favor history's science over its art. In analyzing the modes of expression naively employed by some of the best known nine- teenth-century European historians, White redirected attention to the reper- toire of imaginative elements that historians bring to the reconstruction of the past. Rhetorical strategy, he argued, is an integral part of historical interpreta- tion. Style is a signature of the historian's imagination, made manifest in the dominant trope, or figure of speech, displayed in his or her text. The value of a historical study, he suggested, endures not only because of its scholarship but also because of its quality as a work of art. Great history has been written across the ages, and it has a lasting appeal, whatever the advances being made at the cutting edge of current research.' From a historiographical viewpoint, White's argument was particularly pro- vocative because it was presented at a time when historians were emphasizing the advances made in history conceived as a science. Scholarship produced since the mid-twentieth century was heralded as its triumph, particularly as pioneered by the much lionized French Annales school. About the time that White's book appeared, some of its leading historians published Faire de l'his- toire (1974), an assessment of the current state of historical research that ex- tolled the new techniques of research they had developed and the new domains of social and cultural history they were in the process of mastering.2 All of the indices suggested that historical scholarship was rapidly being professionalized and was to be judged on the basis of its technical expertise. 1.

Yet his interest in the rhetorical resources, and hence the constructed nature of history, was raised at a time when many historians were expressing concern about the conceptual limits of narrative as the backbone of history. It was not just that the Annales school had opened up new subject matter in social and cultural history. The rhetorical turn in historical scholarship announced by White coincided with and in many ways was a reflection of a growing disillusion- ment with the framework within which historical investigation had long pro- ceeded the unifying narrative that linked past and present in a pattern of anticipation for the future. In its way, Annales historiography contributed to the breakup of the grand narrative. Fernand Braudel's formulation of the relativity of historical time to the phenomenon under investigation made historians more sensitive to the multiple timelines within which historical change might be considered.' But the disenchantment had less to do with history's science than with history's meaning for the present age. The linear conception of history, with its implicit faith in progress, was losing its appeal.4 Braudel's paradigm, which put the emphasis on balances and imbalances in long-range historical processes, was symptomatic of the changing temper. Of more programmatic importance may have been the inquiry by Michel Foucault into the way in which the modes of parlance that we invent shape the culture in which we believe. Many historians expressed open skepticism about the quality of his research. But others were impressed with his method of disassembling the discourses out of which culture has been fashioned.5 That is one reason why his scholarship elicited such enor- mous interest. Culture, Foucault argued, is produced through its epistemolog- ical forms more than its intellectual inheritances, and therefore merits a new kind of historical inquiry into the way these forms are made. As one analyzes and inventories these, he argued, one discovers not only the historical diversity but also the constructed nature of human culture. From a historical perspective, our cultural traditions are conceptions imposed upon the past, not a wisdom emanating from it. The making of history is a manifestation of the power of the groups that define its forms. Foucault proposed a new agenda for cultural history, one that set aside the history of the transmission of ideas for the history of the elaboration of discourse the rhetoric that shapes cultural under- standing.6 Foucault's work had a heuristic effect. Many historians took seriously his proposition that history is a function of the structures with which historians frame our understanding of the past. During the 1970s and 1980s, they proposed various categories for its reformulation: discourse, language, ethnicity, gender, 3. Fernand Braudel, Ecrits sur ihistoire (Paris, 1969), 11-38. 4.

Each approach offered the seductive promise of a hermetic history to be uncovered in the underlying elements of its composition. Broaching the rhetorical frontier was like starting over. In discussions of historiography, the question of how history is constructed began to crowd out that of how historians gather and evaluate data. Indeed historiography itself moved from the pe- riphery to the center of the historians' interest. It is not surprising that all such efforts at reclassification of the basic structures of historical writing should have led back to memory. Since ancient times, memory had been perceived to be the seat of the imagination, the inspiration for, as well as the source of, our inquiry into the past. The problem of memory's relationship to history, therefore, became a leading field of historical investiga- tion in the 1980s. The initial studies stayed close to the theoretical issues. Histo- rians rediscovered the work of Maurice Halbwachs on collective memory and of Frances Yates on the art of memory.7 The history of the politics of public commemoration became popular. It prepared the way for studies of the many memorable elements that contribute to a national identity.8 The prototype for this approach was the ambitious project of Pierre Nora, who inventoried the places of the French national memory as they had been elaborated over the centuries.9 Similar studies followed for other nations.10 One worried too about the limits of memory, of those elements of the past consigned to oblivion in a world in which public memory was so visibly tied to public power. It is the basis of an important genre of Holocaust studies that has emerged in the 1990s.'1 In their ensemble, these studies made clear that memory had become a prized object of the historians' attention. I have under review two remarkable contributions to what might be called the culture of memory. These proceed from the groundwork noted above but pursue original avenues of their own. We might characterize them as a second generation of studies in the history of memory. What distinguishes them are their efforts to identify the way in which memory operates more pervasively within culture, not just in self-conscious projects of commemoration. Matt Mat- suda seeks to explain how the presence of memory was experienced in late nineteenth-century France in a variety of institutional settings. Simon Schama would show us the way in which images of nature have inspired, shaped, and revised cultural traditions across the span of Western history. Matsuda and Schama thus deal with quite different subject matter. They are different too in style and approach. Matsuda's study is carefully focused on a 7.

Schama, by contrast, pursues the theme of the history of nature's imagery toward the limits of its expressions. His book is characterized by its encylopedic diversity. Its coherence lies rather in the imaginative grasp of its author, who manages to weave a complex pattern of narrative threads around the principal places of our memory of nature. These authors display differences of temperament as well. Matsuda is a disciplined author. He views modern memory from a critical distance. He is judicious, fair, cool toward his subject. His topics are carefully focused and his personal feelings hidden from view in his text. Schama, by contrast, is a more poetical author. He empathizes with his subject matter more readily. His prose is expressive. His topics are expandable and he is more visible in his narratives. In one important respect, however, these authors are at one. Both use the classical art of memory as the organizational principle for the composition of their studies. This last point is crucial to understanding the common ground they share as historians, and it is what makes their books historiographically distinctive. Not only do they discuss the problem of memory's culture; they employ a classic mnemonic technique to conceptualize their histories. For both authors, one might say, history has become an art of memory. The classical art of memory was not about mere remembering. It was also about organizing knowledge of giving priority to some things, while con- signing others to oblivion. It was based on a combination of topics and tropes. Topics in the classical art were unforgettable places of memory. They served as reference points for the data to be retrieved. Tropes were the imaginative forms in which topics found expression. They were employed to deepen and sustain interest in a topic once it had been evoked. For the conventional historian the art of memory conceived as topical em- plotment was of little value, for it was assumed that the plot or story line had little flexibility. The foundation of history was its narrative thread, which pro- vided a serial structure a beginning, middle, and end. Variations might be made in the way a story was told, but its essential pattern as a timeline was always the same. The historian told a story and fitted topics (landmark events, crucial dates, significant turning points) to it along the way. In this formulation, topics were used to confirm the narrative, commemorating its salient points as they presented themselves in temporal sequence.'2 It is interesting in this re- spect to recall that White analyzed the rhetorical resources of historical writing primarily in terms of strategies for shaping the style of the narrative. The au- thors' capacity to put together elements of story archetype, purpose, and ide- ology was a measure of the imaginative power of their work. The problem of 12. As recently as 1964, H. Stuart Hughes in his History ais Art and as Science: Twin Vistas on the Past (New York, 1964), 68-88, a well-informed essay summing up the then current thinking on the relationship between history as art and as science, continues to invoke narrative as the unifying thread that holds historical scholarship together.</page><page sequence="5">382 PATRICK H. HUTTON memory's topics as a structure for historical writing had not yet surfaced on the historiographical horizon, and for him (as for all of us) the basic narrative line was understood to lie beyond the limits of aesthetic invention to which the historian was entitled. For Matsuda and Schama, by contrast, the relationship between narrative and topics is reversed. Rather than identifying topics within a narrative, as historians used to do, they use their narratives to illustrate their topics. Their histories are organized around places of memory, chosen to stimulate curiosity about the past. Narratives are still important, those about particular events or personalities perhaps more so than has been the case in much of the social history of recent years. But herein there are many narratives, each self-con- tained and reduced to the scale of the mnemonic reference points at which they are situated. Matsuda and Schama topple narrative from its privileged status as the structural foundation of history, and integrate it into the mnemonic de- sign of the problem they would explore. In their rhetorical strategy, the lo- calizing of historical narrative at places of memory becomes an essential aspect of the historian's composition. In selecting their own sites of memory, Matsuda and Schama give us some idea of how far historians have moved from the coherent narrative design that was the defining plot line of so much of modern historical writing. Their ap- proach tends to deepen our perspective on the art in historical writing. For the authors exercise control not only over the rhetorical resources used in telling the narrative, but also over the varied starting points from which narrative proceeds. Here the authors lead their readers into the past via particular stories of their own choosing. In the longstanding debate over whether history is an art or a science, their studies would seem to push the envelope of history toward the limits of its aesthetic possibilities. I shall examine each work with that premise in mind. One testament to the depth of Matsuda's book is that it defies easy summary. He claims to be writing what is "in some ways a general history of France and Europe between the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and the beginning of the Great War in 1914, arranged around conventional themes." By general history, he means the themes commonly addressed in histories of the era: the fortunes of the political left, the quickening of commerce, the expanding role of the nation-state in managing the lives of its citizens, the imperialist ventures of the European powers, the influence of the press and the force of public opinion, the trend toward cultural standardization, the social changes that followed from the migration of rural people toward the cities. "I have chosen them for their familiarity," he explains. "Their strangeness," he proposes, "results from writing that history in terms of memory" (3-4). Matsuda would have us come to know modern memory by appreciating its workings within late nineteenth-century French culture. We might say that for him we come to understand memory by becoming acquainted with the thinking</page><page sequence="6">MNEMONIC SCHEMES IN THE NEW HISTORY OF MEMORY 383 about its nature in that era, particularly in its tacit assumptions. It is a concep- tion of memory quite different, for example, from that of the Renaissance era, as described by Frances Yates. Scholars have sometimes treated Yates's view as a timeless definition. But Renaissance memory was still closely tied to the mnemonic formulae of oral tradition. Modern memory, Matsuda explains, was remodeled to suit the needs of print culture, with its vastly expanded capacity to preserve memory in new material forms. Memory in print culture, he shows us, utilizes a different mnemonics from that of the classical art. With the advent of print culture by the eighteenth century, the classical art withered away. In one of his most interesting and original chapters, Matsuda shows us how mne- monics was reinvigorated in its nineteenth-century incarnation by substituting configurations of words and numbers for the places and images of the classical art. As a technique for organizing knowledge, the art of memory may have been shunted from the center of high culture to the periphery of popular culture. But its reinvention was indicative of the changing understanding of memory in the modern world, accustomed as it had become to more abstract ways of thinking. In other words, memory for Matsuda has a history in the sense that every age will reinvent its forms to serve its particular cultural needs. If Matsuda identifies his themes readily, he avoids simple definitions of what he means by memory. "My aim," he tells us, "is to elaborate 'memory' as a multiplicity of unique locations whose very range and complexity will demon- strate the common characteristics of the 'general history' I wish to describe" (7). In reading his book, we encounter the contested conceptions of memory that he juxtaposes at his sites: personal versus institutional memory, for ex- ample, or memory as it is given in experience and as it is imposed in cultural stereotypes. None of this can be reduced to a simple formula. But he does leave us some clues about how his conception of memory might be more systemati- cally explained. In broad terms, Matsuda posits a tension between two moments of memory. One is archaic, believed by contemporaries to emanate from a phylogenetic inheritance. The other is modern, tied to the human genius to fashion new cultural forms. The interest in memory in late nineteenth-century France, he suggests, lies in the heightened tension between these alternative conceptions of its influence in the contest between images of a primordial past that press into the present with relentless insistence and those of an expanding present that would efface the past. Primordial memory exudes from the body. It is an organic memory recognized in its anthropomorphic signatures: the circulation of the blood, gestures of self-expression, character traits, particularly those signifying atavistic behavior. Its ways are slow yet fateful in their influences. Modern memory reshapes these ancient habits of memory by imposing its own forms. Its power to do so is tied to the invention and institutional use of new technologies that enshrine memory in more tangible forms systematic record keeping, the expansion of the archival resources of the state, for example, or the new arts of photography, sound recording, and cinema. These are the ma- chines that produce memories for the modern era.</page><page sequence="7">384 PATRICK H. HUTTON If modern memory is a contest between these two expressions of its force, it is one in continual movement. They are ceaselessly being renegotiated in the face of what was perceived by contemporaries to be history's accelerating pace of change. The cinema epitomized this sentiment that the world was at once more concrete and more evanescent than it had ever been before. This popular new art form conveyed an impression of verisimilitude, yet its appreciation was based on an optical illusion. In light of this association of memory and movement, Matsuda argues, modern memory is not to be construed as the retrieval of the past, but rather as a present judgment about which elements to trust, or how best to reconcile them. "The past is not a truth upon which to build," he reminds us, "but a truth sought, a re-memorializing over which to struggle" (15). Here he introduces with exquisite effect the theory of memory propounded by the philosopher Henri Bergson at the turn of the century. In his Matiere et memoire (Paris, 1896), Bergson explained memory as a play of judgment, an activity of selecting and coordinating images in continual move- ment. Memory is a presence of the past, a reenactment, but one that is different each time it is evoked. For Matsuda, as for Bergson, memory is about present choices over contested images of the past. The effect of this opening between a moment of memory defined by its inertial power and another by its gathering speed, Matsuda sug- gests, was to heighten anxiety among the French about their capacity to recon- cile them. Read herein his interpretation of the source of the "fin-de-siecle malaise," the mood that was said to inhabit French culture in that era. In the tension between the appeals to ancient and modern memory, many French people sensed the decline, indeed the degeneration of their culture. Their expo- sure to these conflicting images of memory created a preoccupation with cycles of decay and renewal, demolition and reconstruction, anarchy and control. So within this specifically historical setting Matsuda identifies two of memory's eternal characteristics its presence and its cyclical sense of time but in cir- cumstances that contributed to the popular sentiment that the present age was situated within that cycle's waning phase. Much of the ingenuity of Matsuda's study lies in his choice of eight places of memory as its organizational reference points. These he describes as cross- roads, places of encounter between the conflicting modes of memory in various spheres of modern life: politics (commemoration); economics (the stock ex- change); pedagogy (mnemonics); medicine (aphasia); law (crime); punishment (banishment); visual arts (cinema); performing arts (dance). He explores the nature of the contest at each of these memory sites, usually beginning with a tableau or a story that illustrates the paradoxes of contested memory (in law: testimony versus expertise, personal versus state identity, primitive innocence versus engineered redemption; in cinema: truth versus illusion; in dance: rural nostalgia versus urban realities). Here Matsuda has done some excellent detective work in discovering for- gotten stories particularly suitable for display at these places of memory. Like</page><page sequence="8">MNEMONIC SCHEMES IN THE NEW HISTORY OF MEMORY 385 the rhetoricians of old, he has a talent for topics, for those he has chosen are wonderfully illustrative of the points he wishes to make. The relationships among them are subtly conveyed, and I would not pretend to have deciphered all of the symbolic interconnections he wishes to show among them. He opens at a place of commemoration where the Vendome column was toppled during the Commune of 1871. The event dramatized the contest between liberal and Jacobin France over the Napoleonic patrimony written on its surface. Though both contenders saw themselves as avatars of progress, they struggled for con- trol over a heritage that was being rendered obsolete by new realities. The real agents of change in this modern world were to be found at a place of business, the stock exchange. It is the subject of his following chapter, a place where abstract conceptions of economic productivity and exchange were the stuff of memories that were made, obliterated, and remade everyday. Chapters on the sciences of memory (mnemonics and brain physiology) are counterpoints for considering late nineteenth-century attitudes toward remembering and forget- ting. Chapters on crime and punishment highlight the efforts of officials in that day to impose their standardized stereotypes on the behavior of witnesses, criminals, and prisoners alike. They shaped institutional memory in the name of norms favored by the state or society's elite. His chapter on judicial testimo- nies tells the story of a rape case, in which the reliability of the memories of the victim were pitted against the behavioral stereotypes deployed by judicial experts. The following chapter about a murder case shows how the govern- ment's standardized forms for establishing identity created a memory of ex- pected behavior on the basis of which the ultimate nonconformist, the vaga- bond, was condemned. The closing chapters deal with the arts, particularly for the play between illusion and reality that modern memory heightened. In all of these examples, Matsuda seeks to get at the tacit assumptions of people in that era call them habits of mind, a collective mentality, a collective memory. He keeps his distance from such attitudes. If his topics illustrate modern themes of the late nineteenth century, they also resonate with our present postmodern concerns: notably culturally constructed attitudes that confirm and perpetuate behavioral, ethnic, and gender bias. If Matsuda has written a general history, it is one that runs against the grain of the prevailing wisdom about how such an approach should be presented. We might characterize the difference by an analogy of forming a general view of the Parisian landscape. The route of the conventional historian might be likened to sailing a bateau motiche up the river Seine through Paris. On deck we observe the salient features of the Parisian skyline on the near shore, as if these were major events in a chronology. It is a continuous voyage amidst prominent landmarks, but most of the background is lost from view. Compre- hensiveness is sacrificed to coherence, not to mention a bias for the most cele- brated places. Matsuda's approach, by contrast, is a bit like getting a general idea of the landscape of Paris by surfacing from underground at random places on the</page><page sequence="9">386 PATRICK H. HUTTON metro. Some of the common architectural features of the city's facade may be immediately recognizable. But the scene at each exit has its particular cultural geography, and it often takes a bit of time to become oriented to its place on Paris's larger map. Nor is it easy to establish the connections among these places. Each one possesses its own ambience, and so generates its own story. There is no promenade from one to the next, just as there is no continuous narrative thread to Matsuda's history. The temporality of the past leading through the present toward an anticipated future, the signature of the grand narrative of conventional history, collapses into a history of the present, where past and future are gathered together in particular places. Matsuda seems to be saying that to get an overview, we may privilege places over timelines. But what of the unexamined spaces that lie beyond the horizons of those to which he exposes us? If Matsuda's history of modern memory is difficult to summarize, Schama's history of the way we have imagined nature in the art and literature of the Western tradition provides a challenge more daunting still. In an extraordinary array of micro-narratives about the lives and work of the image-makers, he scans the entire heritage of nature imagery in Western culture. Here he wishes to show the inextricable way in which nature and our conceptions of it have become intertwined in the civilizing process. As he explains: "Objectively ... the various ecosystems that sustain life on the planet proceed independently of human agency, just as they operated before the hectic ascendancy of Homo sapiens. But it is also true that it is difficult to think of a single such natural system that has not, for better or worse, been substantially modified by human culture" (7). Such images build on one another across the ages to become the resource with which we understand not only nature, but ourselves. "We need only poke below the subsoil ... to discover an obstinately rich loam of memory," he explains in a particularly earthy metaphor. "The sum of our pasts, generation laid over generation, like the slow mold of the seasons, forms the compost of our future. We live off it" (574). One need not read very far in order to recognize Schama's unusual gift for pictorial description. More than nature's workings, it is humankind's powers of imagination that interest him. He is therefore eager to contend that our collective memory of nature is informed by our imaginative representations as these have accumulated over the centuries. "Landscapes are culture before they are nature; constructs of the imagination projected onto wood and water and rock," he explains (61). He is also prepared to embrace that imagery, and for this reason he writes a more personal book. We might say that he is intrigued by what Matsuda characterized as archaic memory-the memory that prompts us, that stimulates our imagination. For Schama, myth and memory are closely conjoined. He shows us how these myths were formed by leading us to the places of their origins, then doubling back through the places of their revision and elaboration across the ages. While one of his intentions is to reaffirm the</page><page sequence="10">MNEMONIC SCHEMES IN THE NEW HISTORY OF MEMORY 387 postmodern wisdom that all our myths are human creations, he is also fasci- nated with myth as the exegesis of primordial memory. Herein he evinces some sympathy for Aby Warburg, the German art collector who sought to identify and codify the social memory of Western culture in its deepest inheritances. All of this is conveyed with subtlety. Without giving himself naively to Romantic sentiments, he tries to show how such imagery has fostered and deepened the imaginative resources of Western culture. Ultimately, his is a history of memory in its mythologies, whose sustaining power he would show us by revisiting the settings in which they have developed. Along the way, Schama tells us something of his own journey. Indeed, his search for his roots is a leitmotif for his larger inquiry into the sources of Western nature imagery. He opens his story with an evocative tableau of his image of the Thames, along whose London banks he lived as a child. His memory of those days quickens his curiosity, beckoning him to ascend the river of his own heritage toward its sources. Figuratively, he travels upstream, which leads him back into the thick, primeval forests of Lithuania, the home of his ancestors. From there, he takes us on a narrative journey across vast spaces and times. All the while, he provides a cultural geography as well as a cultural history. If his is a personal journey into memory, it is also a poetical one. Like the images he studies, his own stimulate the imagination of his readers. Schama's project is broader in scope than Matsuda's, but his emplotment of the places of memory that serve as his reference points is simpler. The sites from which he proceeds are threefold: wood, water, and rock. His narratives begin with and return to each of these places: with stories calculated to explain how virgin forests are transformed into domesticated landscapes, rivers of un- known origins into the watercourses of commerce, majestic mountains into objects of human conquest. He concludes with a coda in which these natural forms are amalgamated in the making of images of natural paradises. But to telescope his narrative in so reductionist a fashion does not do justice to the intricacies of Schama's historical construction. Following what might be characterized as a poetic logic, his study is artfully designed. He begins by telling a story, but that story inspires others, just as a memory image stimulates a train of thought, which in turn evokes new images along the way. So he proceeds until each theme is exhausted, stringing together stories, each a modulation on his basic theme. He is a bit like the Homeric rhapsody, the stitcher-together- of-tales, who educated his audiences in ancient Greece by entertaining them with his exotic lore. He leads us deep into the woods, far up the rivers, high into the mountains. His subjects are images conjured up by real people in real places. But his larger purpose is to show us how our imaginations have evolved with the landscapes we have fashioned out of our natural environment. Amidst the variety of his material, I detect what I perceive to be a loose pattern in the way he ties together his stories about our construction of nature. Sometimes the connection lies in the way in which artists or poets inspired one another. The mutual influence of the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz and the</page><page sequence="11">388 PATRICK H. HUTTON American novelist James Fenimore Cooper is one example of such a connec- tion. But his larger purpose is to show more complex patterns in the influences of living memory over time. The stories that he strings from his places of memory would seem to follow the memory cycle, in that a memorable theme is revised each time it is revisited. Each string proceeds from sacred sources toward more profane domestications. In the process, nature is sometimes ideal- ized, sometimes commercialized. The pattern is never rigidly fixed, just as the memory cycle is never inexorably followed. In its way, each moment of memory is capable of inspiring new beginnings. Consider forests, for example. "What was this thing my family seemed to have about forests?" Schama queries rhetorically in his musing on his ancestors working simultaneously in the woods of Lithuania and of California (240). Schama's forests nurture our imagination of the hidden sources of our culture. He takes us along on family excursions to both places, first to the remaining stand of the Lithuanian forest, ancient lair of the big game that his ancestors must have stalked. He journeys back via the German forests, first mythologized by Tacitus as the hiding place of the warriors who so successfully held the Roman legions at bay. Tacitus created a certain image of the Germans' relation- ship to the forest that stuck. While little is now left of the forest, Schama shows us how it has perennially given life to German mythology. By painters (such as Caspar David Friedrich and Karl Wilhelm Kolbe) and folklorists (such as Johann Herder and Wilhelm Riehl) throughout the ages, the German forest was invested with sacred meanings, the deep sources of a mythology that con- tributed to the German sense of identity, sometimes in benign, sometimes in demonic ways. England's forests, by contrast, are epitomized in the domesti- cated landscape of the Greenwood tree (as nurtured in the writings of William Gilpin, for example, or John Evelyn). Even Robin Hood is a charming villain in comparison to his German counterparts. Schama culminates his trek with the visit to the giant sequoias of California, living testament to the power of the American wilderness to inspire an image of our own nation's grandeur. Schama repeats the same mix of real and imagined journeys in his following section on rivers and streams. Watercourses also lead us on voyages of dis- covery. He recounts the adventures of Sir Walter Raleigh in his explorations of the Orinoco River in South America, and of Joel Barlow and a host of successors in their quest to discover the source of the Nile. Each in his way was inspired by a river myth about sacred origins, primordial harmonies. Raleigh found people still living close to what he imagined to be a state of nature; the Nile explorers the ruins of a once great civilization. Rivers, too, served as bloodstreams of a nation's power, as did the Thames in the heyday of England's seafaring commerce. The advent of steamboats plying the waters of America gave new impetus to river myths in modern times. Mountain imagery, in its turn, is about challenge and conquest. Schama re- minds us that it is the last domain to be drawn into our humanized, domesticated nature. Its mythology deals in the grandeur of human images written on rocks</page><page sequence="12">MNEMONIC SCHEMES IN THE NEW HISTORY OF MEMORY 389 by sculptors, or the sentiments of wonder inspired in hikers seeking to ascend into such forbidding places. He opens with the story of Gutzon Borglum, who took on the awe-inspiring task of carving Mount Rushmore in the 1930s, thereby fulfilling an ancient dream about colossal rock carving extending back to the unrealized project of the Greek sculptor Dinocrates, who had wanted to carve the bust of Alexander the Great on Mount Athos. Mountains in their pristine beauty inspired poets (from Dante to Horace Walpole and Thomas Gray) and painters (Albrecht Altdorfer, for example, or Salvator Rosa) to depict the personal challenge of confronting them. They have also been sculpted into calvaries and tabernacles to reaffirm the faith of pilgrims and into nature trails to accommodate mountaineering tourists. These are only a few of the byways explored by Schama on these grand journeys out from his places of memory. Along the way, he shows us how original images are fashioned over time into ideal types, sometimes for com- mercial purposes, sometimes for spiritual ends. The images of nature evoked by each generation are at once repetitions and revisions of earlier ones. The return of our memories of nature typically come in idealized form. From one last mnemonic reference point, therefore, Schama traces the way images of wood, water, and rock have been joined and transfigured in our conceptions of Arcadia, the pastoral utopia. Even here there is something for the highbrow and the lowbrow. Sometimes the tableaux of Arcady are idealized places of retreat for a privileged elite (as in Virgil's Georgics); other times they are do- mesticated forests for mass recreation (as in Claude Denecourt's guide to the forest of Fontainebleau for the Sunday crowds taking the train from Paris). There is a wonderful balance in Schama's conception of our memory of na- ture. Like life itself, it is full of good and evil, banality and poetry, noble and base motives, spiritual quest and profane exploitation. In its ensemble, it is a reply to those environmentalists who would have us draw a sharp distinction between pristine nature preserved for future generations and humanized na- ture exploited for present ends. He shows us that our relationship to nature is a living and ongoing exchange. While we may have destroyed much of our natural heritage in alarming ways, that heritage continually inspires us to create richer images of our civilization and of ourselves. Schama possesses the Roman- tic's gift for appreciating our idealizations of the past, but there is little nostalgia here. As he says, "If this is a book of memories, it is not meant as a lament at the cremation of our hope. Rather it is a journey through spaces and places, eyes wide open, that may help us keep faith with a future on this tough, lovely old planet" (19). The studies by Matsuda and Schama display solid research and unusual intellec- tual sophistication. They are important contributions to the emerging genre of the history of memory. So appealing are these studies that they raise a further question: shall more of us henceforth write history as they do in this postmodern way, substituting places for times, and making of history an art of memory?</page><page sequence="13">390 PATRICK H. HUTTON Many historians are impressed with the possibilities of the memory topic. They see it as the opening of a major new field of scientific research, much as their predecessors saw social history in the 1960s. In this manner, some scholars believe that memory's relationship to history is a subject of such enormous complexity that we are only beginning to understand it. It is as if we have yet to impose history's science upon memory. So conceived, the history of memory is a vein that we shall be mining for a long time before we can ascertain the quality of its ore. But if the studies under review are examples, we seem to have already fathomed that relationship rather well. One should remember, too, the chimera of the totalizing ambitions of the new social history of only a generation ago. To return to the point I raised in my introduction, for historians today the question of the meaning of history is in flux, and their current orienta- tion is one of experimentation against a backdrop of suspended judgment. The history of memory may be a new field of research to exploit, but it is also a forum for critical reflection on our present concerns about a crisis of historical time precipitated by the fading of the grand narrative of the nations' progress. Memory's long-range future as a field of historical research is at this time con- jectural. It may signify less a long-range shift in method, more a present reflec- tion on the dilemma of conceptualizing history in our times. Under these conditions, the approach pursued by Matsuda and Schama signi- fies a powerful reaffirmation of history's possibilities as an art. But it is an approach pursued at the price of giving individual authors extraordinary lati- tude to create their own framework for history's representation. There is an irony here. For the personal framework for shaping history inspired by the memory topic dissolves the collective memory that historiographical traditions once provided, a common sense of our place in time upon which historians might agree."3 Some historians see this as a benefit. In the manner in which Richard Rorty appealed to the philosophers, they offer the consolation of a more open and tolerant conversation among historians.4 It is an appealing prospect for the cognoscenti, whose profound knowledge of their subject matter permits them to participate without fear of losing their way. But if in the future each historian were to envision a personal framework for locating history's events, where would historians find a basis for seeking mutual under- standing? In this respect, one worries less about the accomplished historians who can readily appreciate work of the sort pursued by Matsuda and Schama because of the comprehensive historical understanding they already possess. But what of students or readers just becoming acquainted with history as a field of intellectual inquiry? Were the topoi of a more conventional historiography 13. The current vogue in France of ego-histoire (best translated as "my history") is symptomatic of this trend. In this popular genre, France's leading historians write highly personal autobiograph- ical accounts of their formation as historians, distancing themselves from the historiographical traditions with which their predecessors would have more readily identified.

Roth, The Ironist's Cage (New York, 1995), 130.</page><page sequence="14">MNEMONIC SCHEMES IN THE NEW HISTORY OF MEMORY 391 to pass out of the common parlance of our discourse, could they as easily find a place to begin their search for meaning in history? So the dilemma about history's place among the arts and the sciences en- dures. The intuition of those who have stressed the science of history has been to search for certainty about the facts of the past upon which we can always rely. The rhetorical turn of historical scholarship has shown us how meanings change with the forms in which historians choose to frame them. But in opening the past to the infinite possibilities in which its memory may be configured, the facts are easily mobilized to serve highly personalized visions of history. The history of memory may not provide a way to resolve this dilemma, but currently it provides the best place to consider it anew. Whatever the future of the histo- rians' claims upon memory, the studies by Matsuda and Schama are for the present quite satisfying. PATRICK H. HUTTON University of Vermont</page></plain_text>
