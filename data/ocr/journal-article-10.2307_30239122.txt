<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Bay Shrimpers of Texas: Rural Fishermen in a Global Economy. By Robert Lee Maril. (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1995. PP- 304. Introduction, illustrations, notes, selected bibliography, index. ISBN 0-7006-0704-8. $17-95, paper.) The people who fish the bays of Texas for shrimp have less capital, smaller boats, and inferior political power compared to the Gulf of Mexico shrimpers who spend weeks at a time trolling nets off the coasts of the United States and Mexico. Although participating in the same market, the two groups seldom over- lap or cooperate. The bay fishers interdict the migration of juvenile shrimp from the salt marshes as they swim through the bays to the Gulf. The Gulf operators say that the bay-fishing boats reduce their potential catch; the bay fishermen re- tort that they have as much right to make a living from shrimp as anyone else. Conservationists attack both groups for threatening marine life and have forced the administration of fishing seasons, licenses, catch limits, and net alterations to protect game fish and sea turtles. For his study, sociologist Robert Lee Maril surveyed 154 bay shrimpers be- tween Galveston and Corpus Christi, spent five nights working as a deckhand, and reviewed newspapers, legal documents, and agency reports. He has pro- duced a broad sociological account with information about workers, economics, and politics. There are special chapters about women who work mainly as deck- hands, and about the Vietnamese who came as refugees and took up bay shrimp- ing as an occupation. This volume is a companion piece to Texas Shrimpers (1983), his study of the Gulf shrimping business. It is obvious that Maril's sympathy lies with the fiercely independent bay cap- tains who work long hours to capture an elusive prey for sale in a competitive market controlled by global prices. The bay shrimper is, himself, an endangered species, and Maril senses a potential loss not only for the economy but also for the culture of the coastal towns if this occupation is lost. Already, 70 percent of the shrimp market of the United States has been captured by imports and Maril assigns scant blame to the shrimper who breaks the laws in order to stay in busi- ness. Maril reveals, moreover, little reverence for the anthropomorphism of sea turtles, or for heavily endowed conservation groups. Although his focus is on the current situation and his historical information is thin, with the passage of time this detailed sociological study will have increasing significance for historians. It is likely to become the classic study of the shrimping industry for this period, and a source that we all will quote. Colorado State University DAVID G. MCCOMB</page></plain_text>
