Summary of a paper read before a meeting of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Mr. Hart has attempted to demonstrate the functional importance of the decorated grave posts of the Tiwi of Melville and Bathurst Islands as providing a means of expressing and at the same time dispelling that feeling of disruption engendered in a community by the death of one of its members. A somewhat similar function is discharged by the compulsory fasting and lamenting of the near relatives of the dead man. Mr. Hart has pointed out that the persons responsible for the preparation of the grave posts must be individuals other than those near relatives ; and, just as the latter must fast and lament, so the former must not do so. He suggests that the making of the posts is a conventionalized mode of expressing that outward mani- festation of grief which all the members of some communities must affect, whether they really feel bereaved or not. Among the Tiwi there are two classes of obligatory mourning rites - one for the near relatives and the other for persons not related to the dead. Ethnological Notes. No. 4. By W. W. Thorpe.

POLYNESIA The Kite : A Study in Polynesian Tradition. By Nora K. Chadwick. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LXI, 1931, 455-491, with plates LV-LVII. An attempt to trace the origin of certain elements of Polynesian culture by comparing the objects and beliefs associated with kite-flying in the Pacific with similar objects and beliefs found in the Malay Peninsula, Java, Japan, Korea and China. Such results as are obtained by employing this method are negatived by the unscientific use to which myth and legend have been put. It is certainly not " the object of the anthropologist to make history out of legend " (p. 456) nor can the reader subscribe to the opinion that " the anthropologist, working without the aid of the historian or the archaeologist, is reduced to speculation " (p. 489). Mrs. Chadwick's belief that kite-flying was a means of bridging the gap between man and the spirit world seems to have some basis in tradition, but, nevertheless, she has placed over-much emphasis upon the literal significance of myths. The myth is more than mere chronicle. Above all, it is a vital cultural influence, which strengthens and informs almost every action and belief of the native. The Sexual Life of the Natives of Ontong Java, Solomon Islands. By H. Ian Hogbin. Journal of the Polynesian Society, XL, 1931, 23-34. Dr. Hogbin has here supplied some interesting material on a subject not often dealt with in any detail by investigatois and indeed on which information is not always easy to collect. He indicates that the sexual attitudes in Ontong Java are fairly free, pre-marital intercourse is not infrequent, especially among men, and that prostitution of women exists in a few cases. Betrothal is general before marriage and a proposal may come from the girl just as often as from the man. Avoidance between betrothed persons exists, but appears to spring from individual shyness and not to be required as a social obligation. Divorce after marriage is common, as is the breaking of a betrothal. In olden days the true physiology of fatherhood was not understood. A Carved Wooden Figure from Hawaii. By H. G. Beasley.

The Knowledge and Use of Iron among the South Sea Islanders. By T. A. Rickard. Man, 1932, 50. Summary of a paper presented to a meeting of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Dr. Rickard postulates that certain of the Pacific Island peoples were acquainted with the use and value of iron before the advent of Cook and others in the eighteenth century. He states that Mendana, in 1568, saw " a chisel made into a nail " {sic)t in the Marshall Islands, and that according to Hawaiian tradition iron in driftwood was washed up on the islands before the coming of Cook. That this may have come from wrecks in the Pacific is quite probable. Mention is made of the sociological effects of the introduction of iron into a neolithic culture.

Man, XXXI, 1931, 183. The erection of bwara awana forms part of the mortuary rites in Normanby Island, D'Entrecasteaux Group. These houses are of the " saddleback " variety found in the other islands of the group, but with the anterior gable extended to enormously disproportionate size. The peak of the gable is about twenty-five feet from the ground, while the whole house is only four feet wide. The building serves primarily as a storehouse for yams consumed at the mourning feasts, and for this its shape is admirably adapted. A space is, however, always left clear in front, and there guests frequently sleep during the feasts. The space also serves as a convenient trysting place for lovers, and it is for this reason perhaps that the bwara awana are known to foreigners as houses of ill fame.</page><page sequence="4">500 BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES Arosi Numerals and Numeration. By C. E. Fox. Journal of the Polynesian Society, XL, 1931, 236-243. In Arosi (San Cristoval) there are several numeral systems. Thus, while there is a decimal system of outstanding importance, yams are counted by fives, strings of shell " money " by fours, coconuts in pairs, etc. The language of this area has also a strong tendency to classify objects and to use different words with each class. The author suggests that here a principle might be found for the classification of Melanesian languages. Alternate Generations in Fiji. By A. M. Hocart. Man, XXXI, 1931, 214. Mr. Hocart states that the principle of alternate generations is the most im- portant feature of Fijian kinship systems. Thus in the Malu tribe, a younger brother applies to his elder brother the same term (elder brother) which they both apply to their father's father. In another tribe a woman calls a grown-up son father, and in another a man speaks of his daughter-in-law as wife's mother. In these cases the person is classed with the generation next but one away from his or her own ; in other words, alternate generations are classed together. This is further seen in the use of terms for the alternate generations. " If I am tako, my father is lavo, my grand-father toko again," and so on. Apparently persons of succeeding generations sometimes marry ; further, it was the usual custom in Nandrau for toko to circumcise lavo and vice versa. The alternate generations are also connected with plants and animals. It is interesting to notice that this principle of alternate generations is found also in north-west Australia and in South Australia. In the Northern Kimberley tribes, which have no divisions apart from patrilineal moieties, father's father is always elder brother. In a number of tribes the grown-up son is father. But, more important, in South Kimberley and in western South Australia definite terms are applied to the alternate generations. In the former area each term includes the inter- marrying pair of sections, but in the latter region where there are no divisions into moieties or sections the alternate generation principle is especially important. The terms here are rjanandaga for the generation of the speaker, of his grand-father and grand-child, and tanatnildgan for the generations of his father and son. Unless a woman be rjanandaga she is not eligible as a wife. On the ceremonial ground the singers sit in two groups, each of which consists of alternate generations. The burial rites are performed by persons who are tjanandaga to the deceased. The operation on the toe of a person who desires to wear a kadaitga shoe is performed by a tana- mild g an, and so on. I do not know of any connection with animals and plants. The principle is no doubt operating with greater strictness in Australia than it has done during the past thirty years in Fiji.</page></plain_text>
