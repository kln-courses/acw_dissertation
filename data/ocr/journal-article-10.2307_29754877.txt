V, The Ancient Buddhist Arts in Central Asia and Tun-huang) - (H?z?kan, Kyoto, 1962, pp. 22 + 356 + 27, with 10 colour plates and 25 collotype plates). This is the fifth volume in the Monumenta Serindica series published and edited by Japanese scholars of central Asian culture; it 112</page><page sequence="2">is largely based on data collected by the Otani expedition to Chinese Turkestan. Such scholars find this data the most easily available which explains its predominance, but material is also drawn from other sources as this vo? lume deals with art in general. Like previous volumes this one is made up of a series of essays. The Introduction is by Ry?tai Hatani and outlines the common characteristics and development of Buddhist art in Central Asia. This art is viewed as a blend of various heterogeneous elements origi? nating in Greece, India, Iran and China, indeed, it has no individual traits but derives its canons from other cultures. Within Chinese Turkestan itself cultural influences vary on a territorial basis: Khotan is the centre of that Indian culture, influenced by Greek tenden? cies, which arrived by way of Kashmir and Pamir and originated in the Punjab and at Gandh?ra; whereas Kashgar and Yarkand come under the influence of Iranian culture. In the early period the Greek culture of Gandh?ra predominated in every field of art and was centred on Khotan, but eastwards Chinese influence increasingly prevails with Turf an as its centre. The architectural monuments go back to the 2nd - 4th centuries, are of Indian and Iranian inspiration, and devoid of Chinese elements: those of the western region are usually the oldest. As for paintings, the author attempts to distinguish styles and periods. In his classi? fication he is largely in agreement with the criteria adopted by Gr?nwedel and Le Coq, but holds that dates are extremely difficult to establish. Roughly speaking, three styles are apparent. The style of the Gizil paintings is the oldest, is a blend of Greek, Indian, and Iranian traits, and may be assigned to the 5th-6th centuries. The second style has more markedly local characteristics (evident in costume and colour-technique) and dates from the 6th-7th centuries: while the third is known as Turkish-Chinese and prevails from the 8th to the 10th cent. The author does not concern himself here with the other two styles, the pure Gandh?ra style of Miran and the pure Chinese style of Turfan which are the oldest and go back to the 3rd century. The art of Chinese Turkestan is essentially Buddhist in character ? Hlnay?na in the Kucha, and Mah?y?na in the Turfan, area. Hlnay?na figurative work is prevailingly transcendental and the persons represented are suffused with a static calm, while in Mah?? y?na figures there is more realism and vitality. For example, the Hmay?nist Arhan seem anxious to achieve abstraction and are quite superhuman in appearance: but ? apart from the bodhisattva ? Mah?y?na figures have realistic costume, a noble appearance and fascinating features. Among the frescoes of Central Asia, there are very many dealing with the J?taka and Avad?na. The reason is that Buddhism pro? bably never managed to permeate the life of these peoples completely, but confined itself to the practice of literal interpretation of the texts without managing to grasp their deeper significance; and the agitated political con? ditions of those times may well have been partly responsible for this. Although Buddhist writings must have been translated and studied in this region there is no evidence of new interpretations or religious movements arising here which would appear to confirm the explanation put forward. It must be concluded that the J?taka and Avad?na were considered the means of greatest interest and most easily understood for disseminating Buddhism, Indeed, it is not too much to imagine that many of them were a product of this region which would explain their frequent recurrence in pictorial figuration ? a sign of their popularity. The sculpture is wholly subordinate to that of Gandh?ra and its works are older than those of architecture. In the final part of the thesis the author expounds his own views about the art of Central Asia. It is not original, as has been observed, but an imperfect mixture of various components. It is limited in its religious character; for its portrayal of religious per? sons is necessarily conventional. Kings, demons, gods are always mere repetitions 113</page><page sequence="3">of Indian prototypes and cannot, there? fore, be original. However, in the artistic treatment of secondary figures that are less closely influenced by tradition there is greater freedom: women, common folk, merchants and disciples are portrayed in what are everyday attitudes of Central Asia. In some cases the reproduction of traditional types allows for a touch of originality here and there ? in a particular use of colour and the brush-strokes to indicate wrinkles or the folds of a dress. The sense of perspective reveals criteria which probably derive from Greek art by way of Iranian art. Another peculia? rity is that the meaning of what is represented cannot be grasped at first sight because events occurring at different times are embodied together in one scene. The Art of Chinese Turkestan by Nobuo Kumagai is a description of the various archaeological sites existing in Chinese Tur? kestan along what was the Silk Route. Sculp? ture, painting and architecture are all dealt with, and the book reports on the principal findings made in each area and describes the various centres each of which had its own peculiar characteristics. Lop-nor (Lou-Ian in Chinese) is the eastern? most area. It contains the Ordeck necropolis affording evidence of those indigenous popu? lations that dwelt here before the arrival of the western or Chinese influx. The widespread use they made of wood in a region which is now something of a desert is highly interest? ing. In tomb C at Lou-Ian, which dates from around the 1st century B. C, there is evidence of contact between China and the West. Chinese and Greek fabrics and tapestries have been found in it; one of these portraying Hermes is especially representative, and the wand appearing in it is a recurrent motif in Bactrian and Saka coins. Stein, on the other hand, sees in this figure a disciple of the Buddha and holds that the tapestry is not of Mediterranean provenance but of Khotanese make. The author, taking account of the markedly Western traits of the figure repre? sented, believes it to be Greek-Roman in origin. Castle A at Lou-Ian dates from the Buddhist epoch and also Temple B which contains an interesting wooden panel portray? ing a Buddha with a trident in his hand. The latter is one of Poseidon's attributes and of Greek origin; we often find it delineated on Saka coins. Mir an. As has been pointed out, this loca? lity was the centre of Greek-Buddhist art in Central Asia. Temples III and V are round constructions of sun-baked bricks with frescoes visible on their walls. Their style is reminiscent of Dura-Europos. A notable feature of Temple III are the frescoes of 12 cherubims; it contains scenes that mainly illustrate the life of the Buddha; while J?taka scenes characterise Temples V. Remains of enormous statues of the Buddha are visible in Temple II. Niya seems, culturally, to belong to the area of Lou-Ian; for the sculptures discovered there are of the same type as those in Temple B. Much evidence of east-west trade has been preserved in the area, and a striking feature is the many representations of western gods and goddesses including Athena and the goddess Roma. Khotan. The two bronze heads of Buddha belonging to the Otani collection are repre? sentative of the sculpture of this region. In features and expression there is perfect cor? respondence to the cherubims portrayed in Temple III at Miran. Then the striking resemblance to the head of Buddha in stone found by the Tucci expedition at Butkara (which also has the same hair arrangement) is a clear proof of their Western origin. Hel? lenistic influence is specially noticeable in the terracottas found at Yotkan. The remains of the temple of Rawak are typical of Me dioeval Indian architecture. Many frescoes have been discovered at Old Domoko, Dan dan-oilik, Tarishlak, etc: in the centre of the larger refigurations Buddha is portrayed sur? rounded by smaller figures. Toqquez-Sarai. The temples of the Kashgar region were destroyed by invading Moslems: 114</page><page sequence="4">Toqquez-Sarai is one of those the ruins of which are still visible. A feature of the figu? res portrayed in this region is that eyes and nose are placed in the centre of the face. Kucha. This area can boast the Qizil, Kumtara and Kirish caves and the temples of Subash and Durdul-Akur which contain a wealth of typical frescoes and stucco-works. During the initial period traces of the art of Gandhara are visible in the delineation of the human body, while in the Bodhisattva gew?lbe- H?hle the figures are close to those of Tun-huang. In the Schatz-H?hle the colour technique is Indian. The initial period, then, is characterised by a considerable variety of styles; but by the 6th and 7th centuries uniformity is achieved in a way that is re? markable for this region. The style that emerged can be directly linked to Sasanian and Byzantine art. The Drona of the Otani collection (coming from a Kizil fresco) is a typical example of this style: the facial ex? pression closely resembles that of Christ in Byzantine art. Shikchin. This occupies the site of the ancient Kara-Shahr that was once peopled by the Tokarians and, owing to its strategic posi? tion, was one of the most flourishing cities of the region. The remains of numerous temples have come to light, built on an Iranian-type plan. The countless stuccoes discovered there and the mainly headless statues are the best examples of Chinese Turkestan sculpture; and as sculpture are as important culturally as the Kizil frescoes are for painting. Those frescoes visible, however, are influenced by Chinese tendencies borrowed from the neigh? bouring localities of Turf an and Tun-huang. Turf an. The remains of two cities ? Yar Khoto and Kara-Khoja ? are to be found in this area. Its architecture was remarkably developed as these important ruins prove. The temples were generally built on an Ira? nian type plan and most intricately at that: Temple P at Kara-Khoja ? of the same type as the one at Yahr-Khoto ? consists of about a hundred minor stupa grouped around a number of major ones. All the other temples have their own particular plan. The cupolas of Temple B are important, being built onto a square structure; they are of pure Iranian style. As for the stucco-work that has been discovered at Kara-Khoja, the Gandhara-type Buddha found by Le Coq is conspicuous. Eyes and nose centrally situated characterise the sculptured figures of this region: a markedly Chinese influence is apparent. Frescoes of the Tun-huang Cave Temples by Ry?ken Sawa. The frescoes in the Tun huang Cave Temples were known to exist before the war; but full information about them only became available in the post-war period owing to the investigations carried out there by Chinese scholars who published an annual report. The frescoes belonging to the 5 th century are representative of the Kizyl style, but with the 6th century a Chinese style predominates. The themes are not only those of Chinese Buddhist art, but also denote a Western origin. In the Sui period, Chinese Buddhist art acquired greater solidity, and themes taken from the Saddharmapundarika S?tra emerge, while there is a corresponding diminution by gradual stages of themes based on the life of Buddha and the J?taka. In the T'ang period there is much excellent work mainly repre? senting Pure Land scenes: the relative fres? coes are characterised by a wealth and com? plexity of colour. In this period eleven-faced figures of the Kuan Yin appear: they are esoteric in origin. In the Sung period new frescoes were produced, but the habit spread of restoring and refurbishing the cave-work of previous ages. The number of new caves opened is relatively small. Many of the subjects are those of esoteric Buddhism deriv? ing from the preceding period: among the new frescoes one depicting Mount Wu-t'ai stands out. It is in this period that the four Kings of Heaven at the corners of the roof began to be painted. Unfortunately there is a deplorable lack of information about Tun-huang and relevant 115</page><page sequence="5">material. The studies published by the Insti? tute for the Investigation of Tun-huang are incomplete and devoid of photographic docu? mentation. Sculpture of Chinese Turkestan by Teruo Ueno. The author begins with an account of the most important sculptural finds made by the Otani expedition in Central Asia, and then goes on to outline the* characteristics of Chinese Turkestan sculpture. The period of greatest effulgence runs from the 3rd to the JOth centuries. Almost all localities have yielded up such sculpture: that dating from the first period is most abundant at Tumshuk, Miran, Rawak, and Khotan; Kizil, Kumtara, Kara-Shahr and Shorchuk abound in middle period examples; while pieces of the last period are to be found at Kara-khoja, Yar khoto, Murtuk and Astana. The subject matter is mainly Buddhist in character, but there is no lack of profane themes. The mate? rials used are wood, stone, copper, stucco, and terracotta. The style is complex and multiple in its components as this region submitted to a variety of influences, But a number of specific styles in Chinese Turkestan sculpture can be distinguished: 1) A classical Western style that in this region was principally influenced by the art of the late Roman Empire. Generally speak? ing, the latter extended as far as Gandh?ra and thus indirectly affected Chinese Turkestan through the work sent there from Gandh?ra. But there are Western traits non-existent at Gandh?ra which means that they must have been inspired directly by Roman art. For instance, among the Khotan terracottas there is the figure of the Gorgon ? a subject unknown at Gandh?ra. In India and Java Gorgon figures are fairly common, but defi? nitely transformed, whereas the Khotan one does not differ from Western models. In many of the sculptures found at Tumshuk and Kizil clear classical influence is evident, especially in the naturalness of posture and gesture. 2) The Oriental and Iranian style. A feature of the Oriental style from Egypt to Mesopotamia is the anthropomorphic repre? sentation. Examples of this style are visible in the furniture found at Niya and Lou-Ian which has animal feet; another example is the elephant with a woman's head found at Kizil. The Iranian style, on the other hand, is embodied in the costume, ornaments, weap? ons, and other utensils, and in the decorative motifs. 3) The Gandh?ra Style. This style, like that of the stuccowork found at Hadda in Afghanistan, is widespread throughout eastern Turkestan. Features of this style are the particular hair arrangement, the three-dimen? sional expression of the face, and the dispo? sition of the folds of the costume. However, Turkestan work being formalised and per? meated by Chinese influence, has lost the original purity of the Gandh?ra style which is most fully embodied only in works of the period running from the 3rd-4th to the 6th centuries. Such a style can also be perceived in the decorative motifs that are classically inspired. 4) The Indian Style. As we have seen, the Gandh?ra style, that filtered into Chinese Turkestan mainly for reasons of geographical proximity, is rarely found in a pure form; it is nearly always mixed with Indian elements. What are the differences between these two styles? That of Gandh?ra has greater natural? ness especially in the delineation of the head and the folds of clothing, whereas the Indian style is sharply formalistic. Both are blended and have penetrated into the same area of Chinese Turkestan ? the western area ? but in different proportions. 5) The Chinese Turkestan Style. This is the outcome of the adaptation, locally, of the Gandh?ra style that has achieved an in? dividual character. It is to be found mainly in the northern area with its centre in Kucha. In sculpture it has the importance that the Kizil frescoes have for painting. Facial ex? pression is fundamentally the same as that at Gandhara, but there is more diversification in the latter and more flatness in the former. 116</page><page sequence="6">The line of the eye is more thinly drawn and the nose is sharper; in other words, the facial expression is more feminine. 6) The Chinese Style. Culturally speak? ing, Chinese influence in Turkestan began in the T'ang period; hence from the 7th-8th centuries onward the art of this region is recognised to be strongly Chinese in character. This tendency is more marked still on the eastern side. There is more body in the figure of the Buddha and it is rounder and more expressive than in Gandh?ra art. The Two MSS. of the Otani Mission viewed from the Standpoint of the History of Chine? se calligraphy, by Kiichiro Kanda. Two of the mss. brought back by the Otani expedi? tion are of singular interest as far as the history of Chinese calligraphy is concerned. The first, Chu-Fu-Y ao-T si-Ching, was found at Turfan and dated ?VI year of Y?an-k'ang? or 296 A.D.; it is important because, chrono? logically, it gives us an idea of the period marking the transition from the ? li-shu ? to the ? k'ai-shu ? style of writing. Moreover, it shows that in this locality many Chinese were engaged in copying mss. and suggests that Turfan was one of the places where the use of the new ? k'ai-shu ? and ? ts'ao-shu ? styles began. The second ms., Li-Pai-W en-Shu, was found at Hai-t'ou and is an old letter. Its beautiful calligraphy, like that of the famous master Wang Hsi-chih of East Chin, and the valuable information it affords about the way of writing letters at that time account for its importance. Painted Manuscripts of the Shih-Wang Sheng-Ts'i-Ching by the late Yusho Tokushi and Kanichi Ogawa. From the 3rd century onward in Buddhist China the s?tra of Yen-lo, the god of shadows, enjoyed great popularity. The Shih-Wang-Sheng-Ts'i-Ching tells of the experiences of the priest, Tao-ming, when he visited the world of shadows and heard the judgments passed on the souls of the dead by ten kings. This s?tra was known by many in China and the habit of copying out the text and drawing the episodes was widespread as a way of helping the souls of the dead. Some of these s?tra dating back to the T'ang period and to that of the Five Dynasties have been found at Tun-huang, and three books have been brought back by Pelliot, Stein and Sato. They can roughly be assigned to the 10th century. The author compares the texts of the two books now in the Bibliotheque Nationale (Pelliot) and in the Japanese Calli? graphy Museum (Sato), and then considers the way the s?tra took shape. Lastly, he compares the illustrations in the three books discovered at Tun-huang with a Japanese copy of the s?tra dating from the Muromachi period and kept in the Mount Koya Library. In fact, this s?tra was not confined to China alone, but was studied in Korea and Japan. Deity Picture from the Tomb in Turfan, by Toshisada Naba. Among the objects found in the Turfan tombs, going back to the period of the reign of Kao-ch'ang, there are some portraits called ? paintings representing Fu-hsi and N?-kua ?. These are two anthropo? morphic figures with a human bust and the body of a serpent. The firmament is depicted in the background. The figures represent Chinese male and female divinities and are bound up with the legend of the creation of the world. The serpent bodies are closely intertwined and represent sexual intercourse. The two world-creating divinities are thus meant to symbolise procreation and accord? ingly placed on the tombs. The intertwined serpents common in Babylonian figurative work ? also a symbol of sexual congress ? afford an obvious parallel: but the author rejects the idea of a direct relationship deem? ing this to be merely a casual coincidence. The Buddhist Art of the Nomadic People by Sh?ki Yoshimura. The peoples who have lived in Central Asia, no matter of what race or in what age, have always based their economy on sheep-rearing owing to the con? ditions peculiar to that region. In this they differed from the Chinese whose economy was agrarian, and the phenomenon even today provides a trait dyunion between the peoples of Mongolia and those of Tibet. The prehis 117</page><page sequence="7">toric graffiti existing in Central Asia and Tibet also afford evidence of common spiritual ties. It is easy to deduce that their characteristic habit was repetition. It is to be found in various forms in the Buddhist literature of Central Asia whose core is the J?taka and the Avad?na. The Hsien-Yu-Ching (the s?tra of the wise and the foolish man), written about 445 in the reign of Kao-ch'ang, exemplifies this sort of literature and the attitude of nomad peoples in Central Asia towards Bud? dhism. This is brought out more forcibly if we compare Chinese acceptance of Buddhism and its tendency to unification. Multiple forms of expression are manifest also in Buddhist architecture. The Tibetan Lama cult and the Cave Temples of Central Asia have this in common: that the sanc? tuaries where the divinities are placed for veneration and the monks perform religious rites are different. Hence, the underlying concept is not the same as the Chinese one which favours the concentration of these two aspects of religion in one spot. Again, in Tibet and Central Asia the tendency is towards complexity in religious objects; in Chinese temples, towards simplicity. Central Asian temples are made of wood, or stone and mud; or are in the form of tents. Those in wood are similar to Chinese ones, those in stone are nearer to the cave temples, while those in the form of tents are in a class of their own. For the tent which can so easily be dismantled and moved has deeply affected the philosophy of life of these peoples; it represents an attitude as practical as possible even in ideological matters. In this connexion, it is illuminating to examine the Buddhist rites and traditions of these peoples which differ considerably in character from those of Buddhist China with their tendency towards abstraction. The same prac? tical criterion is to be noted in the figurative work illustrating the life of Buddha; work which entered Tibet from Kucha in the north by way of Tun-huang. The Tibetan text, gNas chen-po brgyad-kyi mchod-rten la bstod-pa, containing a symbolic biography of the Buddha condensed into eight episodes, followed a reverse process: it spread from Tibet northwards where it was translated into Uighur and influenced Uighur Buddhist thought. Lastly, the author deals with the illustrated scrolls devoted to the life of Buddha that were disseminated throughout Tibet and Mongolia; and he stresses the value of their contents.
