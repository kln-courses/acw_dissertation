<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. I3, NO. 3 September, I938 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW of BIOLOGY THE CONCEPT OF PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY BY W. E. AGAR Professor of Zoology, The University of Melbourne I. INTRODUCTION T HE propriety and utility of the concept of purpose in biology is such a perennial subject of dis- cussion that some justification for adding to the literature on the matter seems required. This justification is partly the importance of the matter, and partly a belief that there are certain aspects of the problem which have not received adequate attention in these discussions. Briefly, these concern, firstly, the fact that a liv- ing organism is not a single agent, but a nexus (both spatial and temporal) of agents; and secondly, the distinction be- tween short range purpose as applied to a single act of such an agent, and long range purpose as applied to the end to which a series of acts is directed. The importance which a biologist as- cribes to the problem of purpose must be influenced by his special interests. There are great tracts of biological research where the problem of purpose is as irrele- vant as quantum physics for engineering. But there are other regions of biology where it is of the first importance. For instance, the biologist may aspire to un- derstand the behavior of an amoeba or of a developing egg in the same sense (even though much less completely) as he under- stands the behavior of his fellow man or his dog. No amount of knowledge of the chemistry and physics of this behavior would give this kind of understanding. At most, such a knowledge would tell him that the chemical and physical proc- esses underlie the macroscopic behavior by which he judges that the man or the dog is acting purposefully. Again, one of the special interests of biology is to arrive at an understanding of the process by which the higher or- ganisms have evolved from the lower, and since we have primary self-knowledge that one of the higher organisms can act pur- posefully, to deny purpose in the lower organisms must involve a radical breach of continuity somewhere between the lower organism and man. Hence an ade- quate theory of evolution cannot be formu- lated without forming a judgment as to whether or not purpose is characteristic of all living organisms. Some scientists and philosophers re- gard the purposefulness of which we are intuitively aware in ourselves as having 2.55</page><page sequence="2">256 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY no causal significance. To them it is simply the mental correlate for a physical process, to which alone causal efficacy is to be ascribed. This question will be discussed in Sections 6 and 8; in the mean- time we will assume the causal efficacy of purpose where it occurs. Purposive interpretation of the responses of organisms (including, for instance, the responses of embryonic or tissue cells) is open to the charge of anthropomorph- ism. But if we regard man as a part of nature, and not as a unique being observ- ing nature from the outside, we cannot regard anthropomorphic explanations as wrong in principle, though they may be erroneous, or useless, in specific cases. Two uses of anthropomorphic explana- tions are inadmissible. The first is when such an explanation appears to be false in fact. For example, if one were to say that the purpose of an egg is to develop into the adult, the statement would al- most certainly be false, having regard to the complex nervous apparatus associated with long range purposes in man, and to the considerations developed in Sec- tion 4. The other inadmissible use of an anthropomorphic explanation is to use it as a substitute for physical or physio- logical research. If one states that the cells of the amphibian blastula respond purposively to the stimulus of the evoca- tor (a statement which we will maintain to be true) this must not be used as a substitute for research into the nature of the evocator substance, the changes taking place at the surface of the receptor cell, the physical relation of this to the sub- sequent reactions of the cell, and so on. But this applies to human purposeful ac- tivities also. The recognition that a man's act is purposeful is not a substitute for examining the neural and other proc- esses involved in the act. And con- versely, a description of these processes should not be used as a substitute for the conclusion that the act was purposeful. In this paper I am not setting out to prove that purpose is characteristic of vital acts in general. No proof seems con- ceivable in the sense that other types of explanation would be excluded. As Woodger says (I9z9, p. 485) "It is always possible to defend microscopic mechanism in principle, if any one wishes to do so, by making your mechanism complicated enough, and by 'postulating' enough sub- mechanisms to meet all contingencies. It cannot then be refuted, but neither can it be verified." And other types of explanation besides mechanism are in the field, for instance, organismic or Gestalt theories, which we will discuss later. But in this paper, I am starting out from the premise that we have first hand knowledge of the purposefulness of our own conscious be- havior, and that it is good scientific method to seek to interpret the acts of other living organisms in terms of the acts of the organism we know best, unless there is good reason to suppose that they are radically different. We will start, therefore, with the as- sumption that it is reasonable to suppose that the acts of living organisms, or living constituents of organisms (for example, cells) are directed towards ends, and dis- cuss how far this is consonant with ob- servation; what are the ends to which the acts are directed; what are the agents which are acting thus; and finally we will come to grips with a theory of causation which includes purpose as a causally efficacious factor. In this discussion I will use the word purposeful for an act directed towards an end or goal when that end is present in consciousness, and purposive for an act di- rected towards an end when we have to leave undecided the question whether the end is present in any consciousness or not.</page><page sequence="3">PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY Z57 If the argument of this paper is correct, responses of tissue cells to stimuli are purposive acts, though we may not even be aware that these are going on. But the man is not the agent concerned in the response of a tissue cell-the agents are the tissue cells themselves, and wc have no adequate grounds either for ascribing, or refusing to ascribe, consciousness to tissue cells. A purposive act, in the sense we are using it, is always the act of an agent, and therefore, in considering whether an act is purposive or not, the first task is to identify the agent concerned. The word agen-t will be defined and char- acterized in Sections 5 and 7; at present we can use it in an obvious sense. The philosophical aspect of the discus- sion which follows has been profoundly influenced by Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism (i9z9), as I understand it. 2. SOME GENERAL FEATURES OF PURPOSIVE ACTS This section deals with the macroscopic rather than the microscopic feature of purposive acts (molar, as opposed to mo- lecular, behavior, in Tolman's terminol- ogy). There is no doubt that a very wide range of vital acts, from the development of an egg to complex instinctive behavior, bears at least a superficial resemblance to our own consciously purposeful acts. Before discussing this resemblance and what it implies there is, however, one point of difference to be disposed of. Our own purposeful behavior is di- rected towards an end in view which is de- pendent upon past experiences. The goal is imaged in terms of memory of past acts and their results. In the case of the de- velopment of an egg, or a spider spinning its web for the first time, whether there is any image of the future action or not, there can be no image depending upon the memory of past experience. In ourselves, a disposition to act in a certain way in a certain situation seems to be overwhelm- ingly formed by past experience. But we have to accept the fact that such a dis- position can also be formed by the processes of embryonic development. Consider this simple example. Some ani- mals instinctively seek the light, others instinctively avoid it-that is to say, the constitution of the organism as developed from the egg is such that it has the dis- position to act in this way. Now it is easy to take an animal which by nature avoids the light, and by giving it an elec- tric shock whenever it runs out of the light into the shade, give it a disposition to avoid darkness and seek the light. The behavior of this animal is now the same as that of another species of animal which is by nature positively phototactic. Placed in the dark, it comes out into the light, and if forcibly kept in the dark will exhibit the same objective signs of fear and striving that it previously did when forcibly kept in the light. It seems that one must accept the fact that there is no essential difference between innate dis- positions to specific action in specific situa- tions which have been formed by the or- dinary processes of morphogenesis, and those which have been acquired by the modification of innate dispositions by experience. The fact that apparently identical behavior dispositions can be pro- duced by such different processes as mor- phogenesis and learning seems quite mysterious on current ideas regarding both these processes, and ought to furnish a clue to a deeper understanding of them. This, however, is not directly our present concern, and I will use the term action disposition for that state of an organism which results in its responding in a specific way to a stimulus, irrespective of whether this state is the result of morphogenetic</page><page sequence="4">258 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY processes alone, or of these modified by relevant experience. The objective grounds for ascribing pur- posiveness to vital acts are familiar, though not always acceptable, to every- one. Firstly, such acts typically have results useful to the performer, and this useful end is reached by a series of acts which cannot of themselves be held to be of any use except as stages in the process of reaching the final useful end. The various motions gone through by a bird building its nest are quite meaningless except in relation to the final result. The mere fact that the activities of liv- ing organisms end in results useful to the organism does not itself establish that they are purposive. This utility is cap- able of explanation, in principle at any rate, on familiar Darwinian lines. Granted that organisms vary in regard to their innate modes of response to stimuli, and that these variations are inherited, then the principle of Natural Selection accounts for the evolution of different types of organisms characterized by ac- tivities tending to the survival of these organisms. But though Natural Selec- tion may be invoked to explain how it comes about that the activities of organ- isms have useful results, the question whether these activities are purposive or not is more fundamental. In fact, what selection does in this respect is to preserve those organisms whose acts are purposed to useful ends, and to eliminate those whose acts are purposed to harmful ends. The utility of the acts of living organisms is therefore not in itself sufficient to estab- lish their purposiveness: rather, it consti- tutes a reason for examining the acts more closely to discover whether there are other grounds for concluding that they are pur- posive. One of these other grounds is the familiar fact that the sequence of acts by which the goal is attained is not always the same. On different occasions the organism reaches the same end by different routes. (By the "same" end is meant a "func- tionally equivalent" end). Even in the most rigidly instinctive behavior the ani- mal has always to fit the details of its action to the special situation. The completed nest, the spider's web, the act of mating, is attained by a train of acts different in detail on every occasion. In embryonic development this is also the case. The most conspicuous example of this is the development of a functional adult, or organ, after the experimental introduction of profound disturbance in the early stages of development. But this is only an extreme case. As every embryologist knows, the course of normal development varies in detail, as does the performance of an instinctive action. In the sphere of behavior this charac- teristic is exhibited as trial and error when elements of complete novelty are present in the situation, and by insight when it is a question of combining into a unitary ac- tion existing potentialities of response to elements in the situation which are not normally combined. Many attempts have been made to eliminate the concept of purpose from the explanation of the fact that different routes may be followed to achieve the same end result. Perhaps the favorite type of theory at present is one which accounts for the facts on the principle used in Ges- talt psychology; namely, that certain physical systems tend to a state where the potential energy is at a minimum. It is easy to imagine, or construct, such physi- cal systems which will reach the same end state by intervening stages which differ according to differences in the initial con- figuration of the system. Let us adapt for our purposes the example given by Peter- mann in his critical discussion of Gestalt theory. If we have five equal floating</page><page sequence="5">PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY 2.59 magnetized needles with the North Pole of each uppermost, and suspended above them a fixed magnet with the South Pole downwards, the five floating magnets will finally come to rest in a regular pentagon around the fixed magnet as a centre, no matter how they were arranged to begin with. Variations in the initial arrange- ments will affect the routes by which they attain their positions in the pentagon, but will not affect the shape and size of the final figure. 3. THE PURPOSIVE AGENTS In this discussion I am conceiving pur- pose as characterizing the acts of agents; and this brings us to a source of confusion in the use of the concept of purpose in biology. It is common, for instance, to distin- guish between a reflex and an instinctive act on the grounds that the former is mechanistic, or at least not purposive, while the instinctive act is purposive. This distinction, however, surely involves a confusion as to the agents which carry out the two actions. Let us consider the reflex act of blinking when a speck of dust falls on the cornea, and the instinctive action, culminating in mating, which is the expression of the sexual instinct. To say that the act of blinking is unpur- posed, and the behavior ending in mating is purposed, is to imply a comparison between incomparables. The reflex act is composed of a series of cell responses to stimuli-that is to say, the responses of a number of agents-the receptor neurone ending on the cornea, the motor neurone, the muscle cells, and perhaps others. This series of acts is to be compared, not with the acts of the mating animal, but with the entire series of acts composing the life cycle-namely, mating, the fusion of the ovum and spermatozoon, the develop- ment of the embryo, and its growth into the adult. To the external observer the series of actions making up the blinking reflex has the useful result of protecting the cornea, and so preserving the power of vision; the series of actions making up the life cycle has the useful result of continuing the species. But there is no agent that we know of which is purposing the preservation of the eye, nor of the con- tinuance of the species. Purpose has to be looked for in the living agents which carry out each individual act of each series. The man is not the agent concerned in the reflex blink, nor is the species the agent concerned in mating, though the interests of each are served by the actions. In each case, the purpose of the agent- whether it be the cells of the reflex arc, or the animal acting under the sexual urge- is to fulfill its nature (a phrase I will try to make more precise later). The animal has a disposition, an instinct, to act in a certain way in a particular situation. Its goal is to achieve mating. It has no con- cern with the wider "purpose" of ensur- ing the continuance of the species. Consider again the agents in the reflex action, for example, the receptor neurone ending in the cornea. This may also be considered as having a disposition, an in- stinct, to act in a certain way in the pres- ence of a specific stimulus-in this case, the irritation of a speck of dust lying on the cornea. Here again, the cell is no more concerned with conserving the visual function of the eye than the mating animal was concerned with the continuance of the species. Its goal is a much more modest one. It is simply to fulfill its nature by initiating a nerve impulse. Naturally none of the objective signs of purposive- ness are to be observed in this act, for it is inaccessible to the necessary kind of observation. Moreover, even if it were accessible, it is doubtful if these signs would be forthconiing. For the extreme</page><page sequence="6">26o THE OUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY simplicity of the act gives little scope for variation in the method of accomplishing it, or necessity for indirect methods of achieving the goal. Consequently, whether or not we are to attribute purpose to the neurone, in the same sense as we ascribe it to the mating animal, will de- pend upon indirect considerations which it is the object of this paper to develop. 4. HORMIC AND BIOLOGICAL GOALS In order to distinguish between the vague, and surely unjustifiable, use of the word purpose in such a phrase "the pur- pose of the sexual instinct is the continu- ance of the species," and the precise and justifiable statement "the purpose of the animal under the sexual urge is to mate", we may perhaps describe mating as the hormic goal of sexual activity; there is an agent striving to that end. The continu- ance of the species, on the other hand, may be called the biological goal of sexual ac- tivity, because although sexual activity serves that end, we can identify no agent striving towards that end. There is no agent that achieves satisfaction by at- taining the biological goal-or, at least, no agent that science at present knows anything about. The present discussion is concerned only indirectly with biological goals. We are not concerned with how it comes about that the acts of an agent, or of a number of different agents collectively, form a series which has results of value to some or- ganism other than the agents concerned. One may remark, however, that our pres- ent knowledge seems to leave us the al- ternative of an agent, unknown to science, to which the biological goal is a hormic goal; or Natural Selection of undirected variation of hormic goals which has brought about the survival of organisms whose hormic goals had these remote consequences. Hormic goals themselves require a fur- ther classification into immediate and ter- minal. Consider the classical case of a wasp such as Ammophila which excavates a nest, then goes in search of a caterpillar. Having found one, it paralyzes it with its sting, and takes it to the nest. It then goes in search of another, and eventually, after the nest is sufficiently stocked, lays an egg in it and seals up the nest. It seems unnecessary to suppose that the hormic goal to which the first acts of this series are directed includes the entire se- ries of acts ending in the stocked and sealed nest. It is enough to suppose that the hormic goal is always a little ahead of the present action. The hormic goal at the moment (stinging the caterpillar, putting it in the nest, and so forth) is the imme- diate hormic goal. The completed, sealed nest is the terminal hormic goal. To assume that the achievement of, or approach to, one immediate hormic goal arouses another which carries the action further along towards the terminal goal which was not the hormic goal at the start of the action, is not to evade a diffi- culty. For this is a constant feature of our own experience. In many of our own consciously purposeful actions we have no clear idea at the outset what the final result of the whole business is to be. If we start to follow up a train of thought, we may arrive at a conclusion which is correct, but was quite unforeseen at the beginning, and which indeed may be very surprising to us. If we are unwilling to ascribe to the wasp at the beginning of its action, the purpose of carrying it all through to the completion of the nest, there is nothing more nor less mysterious in the action eventuating in the completed nest, than in our train of thought eventuat- ing in an unforeseen conclusion. In both cases we have to accept the fact that the organization of the organism is such that</page><page sequence="7">PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY the achievement of one hormic goal evokes another one appropriate to the further- ance of the action. The development of the egg has long been regarded by biologists as a test case for the application of physical as opposed to teleological theories of vital action. But the case against teleology has been exag- gerated by confusion of hormic and bio- logical goals. By a false analogy, teleolog- ical causation has been held to involve the hypothesis that the egg starts its develop- ment with the purpose of becoming an adult, and of "knowing how" to achieve this end. But the adult cannot be the hormic goal of the egg, if only because a considerable part of its development is carried out by relatively independent sub- agents (self-differentiating parts). And it seems certain that the hormic goals of these agents must develop with progres- sive action as we have described above. We will return to the problem of morpho- genesis in a later section. 5 THE NATURE OF THE UNITY OF THE ORGANISM The conception of the organism as an organization of agents raises the question of the nature of the unity of the organism. Although the question of teleogical causa- tion can be considered apart from this, it is quite fundamental for any understand- ing of purposive behavior of the type which we actually find in living organ- isms. At present, the tendency is to emphasize the unity of the organism as opposed to its multiplicity. And, of course, this unity is a very real and important feature, but should not be allowed to obscure the fact that this unity is a unity of agents which for many purposes must also be considered as individuals. As discussed more fully later, embryonic development is characterized by the sub- division of the organism into parts, whose relation to the organism as a whole seems to be mainly that of responding to stimuli supplied by the morphogenetic fields, either directly or through the agency of chemical substances localized by these fields. But once these parts, or agents, have responded to these stimuli, they go their own way, often themselves sub- dividing into sub-agents which respond to the morphogenetic fields of the new parts. The essential independence of these parts is illustrated by the well-known trans- plantation experiments, where for in- stance, an amphibian limb-bud trans- planted to a foreign site, such as the head, continues to develop as a limb. The re- lation of self-differentiating parts to the whole is little more than that of parasite to host. Comparatively late in the development, these relatively independent parts, or agents, become connected up into a new unity by the development of the nervous system. But this new unity does not abolish the individual agents. It is a unity achieved, partly by the formation of a new connection between these agents, partly by the development of a dominant Central Agent which supplies stimuli to the sub-agents (effectors) in return for stimuli which other sub-agents (receptors) provide for it. The nervous system is, of course, not the only unifying factor in the adult animal. The hormone system must be reckoned as one of them. The unitary factor found in the developing embryo in the form of morphogenetic fields is also clearly present in the adult; the brain fields of Gestalt psychology, moreover, seem to be of comparable nature (Sec- tion 6). Anatomically, cells are the most strik- ing examples of the sub-agents which are thus mutually related to constitute the organism as a whole. But cells are not</page><page sequence="8">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY the only, or perhaps even the most char- acteristic, agents. An agent is any region of activity which acts causally as a unit. This definition logically includes physical objects, an electron for example-and indeed in Whitehead's system the dis- tinction between the living and the non- living is one of degree, not of kind. But now we are considering only living agents -that is to say, regions of activity which exhibit, in their degree, the features by which we commonly judge that organisms as a whole are alive. One obvious cri- terion is that when isolated from the rest of the organism, they continue for a time at least to manifest the phenomena of life; indeed their life seems to be dependent on their connection with the organism as a whole only in respect to extraneous fac- tors such as supply of nourishment, and so on (as demonstrated by culture of parts of organisms in vitro). It is true that this criterion is not always available, but as a rule, it is not difficult to distinguish be- tween parts of an organism which are alive, and parts lower down in the hier- archy of organization, such as atoms, which considered apart from the rest of the organism are not alive. Cells, then, are only particularly con- spicuous examples of agents in this sense. And there are indications that a cell may be a nexus of agents dominated by its own central, coordinating agent. This seems to be the case in most Protozoa, where cell parts such as cilia, and contractile vacuoles, have the same sort of relation to the cell as a whole as the cells of multi- cellular animals have to the organism as a whole. On the other hand, we have to recog- nize agents involving larger regions than cells. Such are the regions carrying the morphogenetic fields, and also what I have called the Central Agent, the agent pri- marily concerned with the behavior of the organism as a whole. In the higher animals this is situated in the brain, in the sense that this is the place where it receives influences emanating from other agents, mainly through the nervous sys- tem, and from which it, in its turn, in- fluences other agents. There is no need to suppose that its limits are closely bound up with any anatomical structure, or even that they are constant. The locus of the Central Agent is the locus of a nexus of processes which is part of a larger spatial and temporal nexus of processes acting and reacting upon each other. The Central Agent is probably identical with the Ego of Gestalt psychology (Koffka, 193 5). This Ego is a field process forming part of a larger field (its behavioral environment), the whole con- stituting the psycho-physical field. Any part of this field which forms a segregated whole within this larger field is a Gestalt, or agent in the terminology employed in this paper. In Whitehead's terminol- ogy, the Central Agent is a nexus of pre- siding occasions. 6. FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE NATURE OF PURPOSIVE ACTION Firstly, what is purposed? Is it, for instance, the action itself, or is it the goal of the action? This would be a false formulation of the problem if by goal we meant the situation produced by the ac- tion. The goal of an animal under the sexual urge is not to bring about a state of affairs where mating has taken place, but to mate. The most primitive type of purposive behavior is probably simply to change a present state of discomfort or dissatisfaction into one of well-being or satisfaction. So if we are to draw any distinction between the action and the goal of the action, it must be between the action and the satisfaction which will</page><page sequence="9">PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY 2-63 accrue from the action. But it is im- possible to separate these two-one cannot separate the satisfaction from the means of obtaining the satisfaction. The pos- sible satisfactions of an organism are specific to it, and imply the means of attaining them. How different organisms came to have these different satisfactions is not part of our present problem-that is a problem of evolution. What is basic to all living organisms, and prior to the evolution of differences between them, is their striving to achieve satisfaction. This applies to the "organism as a whole," whether dominated by a Central Agent or not, and also to its various sub-agents-though the possible satisfactions are very different in the different agents. Many biologists and psychologists would object to the statement that the purpose of the organism is to achieve satisfaction, and would say that the state- ment ought to run: It is a property of the organism to act in a certain way in a certain situation, in the same sense as we say that it is the property of oxygen and hydrogen under certain circumstances to combine into water, and that what I have called satisfaction is simply the comple- tion of the process, the arrival at a new stage of equilibrium. The most sustained attempt to establish this view is probably to be found in the Gestalt system of psychology. For this reason, I must discuss the fundamentals of this system very briefly-especially as Kohler has extended Gestalt conceptions to the prob- lem of the regulation of embryonic processes. The Gestalt conception was originally founded upon consideration of visual per- ception. It was found that these phenom- ena displayed characteristics similar to those found in certain physical systems, especially those whose changes are de- scribable on the principle that their poten- tial energy tends to a minimum, as in the example of the floating magnets mentioned above. (The example chosen by Koffka is the tendency of a soap-bubble to assume the spherical shape.) This similarity is considered to be more than an analogy. The field properties of phenomena as experienced are believed to be due to the fact that these phenomena are the cor- relates of actual physical fields in the brain. Hence the total brain field is called the psycho-physical field. Such a field, or organised part of it, is a Gestalt. Applied at first to visual perception, it has been developed, especially by Kohler and Koffka, into a complete explanatory system of mental processes and behavior. The Ego for instance, corresponding roughly to my Central Agent, is a special sub-system of the psycho-physical field, to which the rest of the field acts as environment. In his latest book (1935) Koffka says of the psycho-physical field "It is a system of stresses and strains which determines real behavior.'" It is fundamental to Gestalt theory that the causal efficacy of the psycho- physical field is to be attributed solely to its physical properties. Although these fields may be the correlates of con- sciousness, the conscious aspect of the process does not enter into the causal explanations advanced by this theory. (Koffka, p. 65.) Consciousness of purpose is simply awareness of stresses and strains within the psycho-physical field which are tend- ing to change the total field in a direction towards greater equilibrium. This may be achieved in the case of human purposes by finding the correct idea which will solve an intellectual problem, or by ap- propriate bodily action where overt be- havior is concerned. But the changes in the psycho-physical field which are the</page><page sequence="10">264 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY correlates of the correct idea, or which result in the stimulation of the appro- priate motor nerves, must be those changes which, under the conditions existing at the moment, will result in a minimum of potential energy in the system as a whole. Gestalt psychologists, however, find it necessary to have recourse to the prin- ciple of isomorphism to account for the fact that physical processes in the brain result in behavior which deals success- fully with real objects in the external world. According to this principle, there is a real correspondence between phenom- ena as consciously experienced and the physical processes in the psycho-physical field with which they are correlated; there is also a real correspondence between the processes in the psycho-physical field and external things. The principle of isomorphism is also used by Gestalt psychologists to meet one of the old difficulties raised against the interpretation of thinking as a mere expression of physical processes in the brain. If the whole of the causal factors in thinking are physical processes in the brain, how is logical thinking possible, and how does it give us true information about the external world? According to Koffka, the intrinsic necessity of a logical conclusion corresponds to the intrinsic necessity of the dynamics of the physical field in the brain. It is clear, of course, that since thought processes do issue in physical changes in the motor nerves, there must be a physical factor concerned. And indeed there can be no doubt that the general principles of Gestalt psychology are of great value to biologists. But surely the necessity of introducing the principle of isomorphism justifies us in continuing to use the con- cept of purpose without translating it into physical terms. For if there is a real correspondence between mental and phys- ical processes, it seems just as permissible to give a causal explanation in terms of mental processes as of physical ones. Let us return now to the processes actually involved in a purposive action, assuming that the end is a causal factor in the process. As we have seen, a pur- posive action implies both the striving after a specific satisfaction, and the means by which this may be attained. But it is cardinal to the whole idea of purpose that the means are only given in a general way, and have to be adapted to the par- ticular circumstances. What are the minimum assumptions we must make as to the underlying processes which make possible the adaptation of means to ends? One assumption is that every adaptive act-therefore probably every vital act-is preceded by a process which in the first instance I will call imagined action. In the final section we will find a more general formula for this process, which, in the form we are con- sidering at the moment, is a highly developed form of a feature of all vital acts. The term imagined action is adapted from the imagined movements (eingebildete Bewegungen) of Palagyi, who makes it one of the corner-stones of his Natur- philosophie. I use the term imagined action, rather than imagined movement, for various reasons, chiefly because I am including in the term the imagined satis- faction accruing from the movement, for as I have maintained, it is impossible to separate the satisfaction from the means of obtaining the satisfaction. Possibly a better term would be imagined experience. Palagyi is emphatic that imagined movement is not the thought of the movement: it is rather the feeling of the movement. And this I suppose we may accept for our imagined action-it is</page><page sequence="11">PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY something prior either to the action itself or to the thought of the action. According to Palagyi, every movement (action) is preceded by imagined move- ment (imagined action). He is referring to the higher organisms where the action is carried out by effectors stimulated by nervous impulse. Here the imagined ac- tion corresponds to neurological processes. But, granted that the acts of any organism are directed towards an end, the concept of imagined action seems logically neces- sary; for the end, even if it is to be achieved by a single muscular or protoplasmic movement, is in the future, and the physical cause of the action must be in the present. The hormic goals of most purposive actions are not, hlowever, to be achieved by a single act, such as a single muscular contraction, but by a series of acts. In such cases the organism (Central Agent) is experiencing imagined action which persists longer than the duration of a single act. This holds even in such a simple purposive action as movement directed towards an object, for slight deviations from the direct path have constantly to be corrected by subsequent movements. Each individual act is de- termnined by a persistent factor which is the general imagined action and a variable factor which is the perception of the situa- tion at the moment as it has developed from previous acts. Imagined action is closely connected with perception. Indeed many psycholo- gists would certainly say that it is per- ception. Let us rather say that imagined action is the way in which an object or situation is perceived. It is charac- teristic of present day psychology to stress the conative aspect of perception. Thus we perceive an orange primarily as something to eat, an angry dog as some- thing to avoid. In its extreme form this is the bodily adjustment theory of per- ception: according to this theory, per- ception is the precursory adjustment of the body to the appropriate action. Behaviorists consider that this bodily adjustment consists of actual minimal contractions, or at least tensions, of the muscles. It does not seem necessary, however, to go so far as that. One may look upon imagined action as a certain orientation of the processes of the Central Agent. More precision will be given to this phrase in Section 8. 7. MORPHOGENESIS This section is primarily concerned with showing that embryonic development may be interpreted as of the nature of behavior, especially of instinctive be- havior; and therefore, if the previous argument is correct, is purposive. Two main problems confront us here. Firstly, the formation of sub-agents, the nature of their mutual relations and of their responses to stimuli; and secondly, the differentiation and development of the purposes by which their actions-forming in the aggregate the process of mor- phogenesis-are influenced. An essential feature of the early stages of embryonic development is the multi- plication of agents. The most obvious of these are the cells, but as has already been emphasized, the locus of an agent is not necessarily bound up with any anatomical boundaries. It may be the region carry- ing a morphogenetic field, for instance, and this may be the whole or a part of the organism. The conception of the sundering of morphogenetic fields into sub-fields is a familiar outcome of the experimental study of morphogenesis for example, the sundering of a limb-field out of the whole, and its subsequent sundering into smaller fields dominating the development of the parts of the limbs.</page><page sequence="12">2.66 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY In consistence with our general concep- tion of the organism, the carrier of a morphogenetic field is an agent in that it acts causally as a unit. But although it is a unit from this point of view, it is a multiplicity from other points of view. It may contain, or be composed of, sub- fields which are also agents in that they may act as units within the main field. In this respect a morphogenetic field is comparable with a molecule, which in many respects acts as a unit, though com- posed of parts which also, under certain circumstances, act as units. The causal action of these agents has now to be considered. The work of Holtfreter, of Needham, Waddington and Needham, and of others, has shown that one action of the dorso-ventral gradient field of the amphibian egg is to concen- trate a chemical substance, the evocator, at the ventral end of the gradient (the organizer). Gastrular ectoderm cells lying above the organizer, even when this is artificially shifted from its proper place, respond to the liberation of the evocator by forming medullary plate. This is a one-way action, comparable to the re- sponse of a dog to the smell of a rabbit. In evocation, the relation between the causal and responding agents is an external one, and does not involve the relation which the two agents have to each other as members of the nexus of agents which make up the organism as a whole. This latter relation expresses itself as the individuation fields of Waddington (I933). In the graded distribution of passive substances such as the evocator, or pig- ments, or of the character of physiological processes as revealed by the graded sus- ceptibility to poisons in the axial gradients of Child, a morphogenetic field acts as a unit; for these gradations bear no apparent relation to the boundaries of the cells or other parts which together form the region which is the carrier of the field. But the field region is also a nexus of mutually related sub-agents, the cells or other parts just referred to. In its rela- tion to these sub-agents, the field as a whole seems to perform two functions. It provides graded stimuli for them to react to, in this respect functioning as an individuation field. It also influences their reactivity to stimuli emanating from within or without the field-their competence (Waddington) to respond to morphogenetic stimuli. A similar situation prevails in the case of the Central Agent of the adult animal. Whether it will respond to a specific sensum depends upon its "field" -that is to say, on the nexus of processes forming the brain field at the moment; moreover, the specificity of the response, if it occurs, depends not only on the nature of the sensum, but also on the character of the field at the moment. This is exemplified, for example, in the different responses to the sight of his master by a dog when he has nothing to fear from him, and when he has committed some act which he fears will bring punishment; or of an animal to a sexual object according to whether it is under the influence of sex hormones or not. The conception of a morphogenetic field as a stimulus field (Reizfeld) has been developed at great length by Gurwitsch (I9zz, I930), who also institutes a de- tailed comparison between the relation of morphogenetic fields to embryonic cells on the one hand, and the relation of brain fields to neurones on the other. The agents concerned in morphogenesis are, like all living agents, characterised by a specific "action disposition," which the whole of the foregoing discussion implies is a mental disposition. These ac- tion dispositions are the morphogenetic po- tencies of the experimental embryologist.</page><page sequence="13">PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY 267 In an earlier part of this discussion, it was maintained that the distinction be- tween instinctive behavior and reflex action disappears when the agents con- cerned are properly identified. We may therefore use the word instinct to cover all action dispositions which owe their specificity to factors other than relevant prior experience on the part of the agent concerned. Instinctive behavior is thus contrasted with learnt behavior, though all learnt behavior is a modification of instinctive behavior. There seem to be no grounds for assuming that any learning takes place in morphogenesis. The whole process of morphogenesis is to be regarded as the unfolding of a complex instinctive behavior, involving the distinction we have already drawn between hormic and biological goals, and between immediate and terminal hormic goals. The total instinctive action is not performed by one agent, but is divided up among a pro- gressively increasing number of agents with increasing specialization of action disposition. It is noteworthy that a comparable situation occurs in the social Hymenoptera and termites. The development from the same germ plasm of different castes with different instincts, is strictly comparable to the development from the same egg of the agents concerned in morphogenesis. In both cases, the agents cooperate to achieve a biological goal which we may confidently assume is not at any time the hormic goal of any one of them. The biological goals are the building up and maintenance of the community in the one case, and of the organism in the other. Thus we are not drawing a speculative picture when we conceive of a living agent, such as an egg, or germ cell, sub- dividing into a number of relatively independent agents with specialised in- stincts which co6perate to produce a biological goal, for this indubitably occurs in nature. The problem is, not whether it is inherently probable or im- probable, but whether this occurs in morphogenesis as it does elsewhere. There is one apparent difference be- tween the responses of the agents in morphogenesis, and those of the "organ- ism as a whole" (the Central Agent). The responses of the former character- istically result in irreversible changes of structure, which has the twofold result of making them incapable of responding again to the same stimulus, and of in- fluencing their competence to respond to stimuli to which they were indifferent before. But irreversible changes may also occur as the result of adult behavior. The act of learning changes the competence of the Central Agent to respond to certain stimuli-a change that may last the life time of the organism. When a rat learns to avoid a lighted alley which is provided with an electric shocking device, the essential change that takes place in the rat is a change in the way it perceives the light. The associa- tion of the light and the pain sensa has altered the Central Agent, or its brain field, so that now the light is perceived differently from its mode of perception before the association was formed. Before the experience the Central Agent was in- different to the light, after the experience it became competent to respond to it. This seems comparable to the change which takes place in the cells of the amphibian embryo, which in the blastula stage are indifferent to the evocator, but in the gastrula have become competent to respond to it-with the qualification that although the result of the changes from the one condition to the other are comparable, the factors which have brought about that change exhibit one</page><page sequence="14">t68 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY extraordinary difference-for relevant ex- perience is causally concerned in the one case (learning) but not in the other; this however we have already discussed. An act of learning is therefore a mor- phogenetic act, and results in the forma- tion of an action or mental disposition which, as we saw earlier, may be indis- tinguishable from a disposition produced by the ordinary processes of morpho- genesis. 8. PHYSICAL AN D TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION The principal theoretical difficulty in accepting teleological causation is its apparent incompatability with physical causation. If every event is caused by a preceding event, where can we intercalate teleology into the causal series? In this section we shall try to find assumptions as to the nature of events and their mutual causal relations which will find room both for physical and teleological causation. The discussion will follow closely the principles of Whitehead's system (I929), as I understand it, so far as this is relevant to the special matter under consideration. But although what follows owes to Whitehead everything of value that it may have, I cannot be sure that I have interpreted him correctly in every point, and the extreme brevity of the exposition does not allow full justice to be done to him. Moreover, I have made my own applications of his ideas to the special purposes of this discussion. The word event, as used in this discus- sion, means a nexus of elementary proc- esses so inter-related as to form a whole when considered in relation to its causal effects on other events, including in these the elementary processes themselves which constitute the nexus. A nexus is a pat- tern, spatial, temporal or both, which is constituted not merely by the spatial or temporal relation of the parts, but by their mutual causal relations. Thus a molecule is a nexus of atoms, and an atom is a nexus of electrons and protons. In every case the elements of the nexus are considered in their dynamic, not in their substantial, character-as processes in Whitehead's terminology. Thus an atomic event is that nexus of electronic and protonic processes which endure for the smallest lapse of time necessary to constitute the system in its causal charac- ter as an atom. What we call an atom is the temporal nexus constituted by a suc- cession of atomic events. Whitehead calls such a nexus, which maintains its character through a series of events, an enduring object. The limiting type of event is a single elementary process. Whitehead calls these actual entities, or actual occasions. As for the purposes of this discussion it is not generally necessary to distinguish between elementary events, and events which consist of a nexus of elementary events acting as a causal unit on other events, I will use the word "event" without always attempting to make this distinction. What I have previously called agents are enduring objects in the above sense. All elementary physical events last at the most for a very small fraction of a second, but living organisms are charac- terized by events of longer duration. In man, for instance, the Central Agent is an enduring object, the events constituting which may last for the time interval known to psychologists as the specious present-up to say, 1 0 to a second in duration, or even longer. A single event in the Central Agent is therefore an event with a time duration of this order. It is necessary to bear in mind the conception of an enduring object, such as a molecule or the mind of a man, as a temporal</page><page sequence="15">PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY 169 nexus of events with a certain continuity of character transmitted from one event to another. Let us now consider physical and teleo- logical causation generally, and specially in relation to the Central Agent. As Whitehead points out, there are two ways in which we are related both to past and future. We may think about them, in the sense that we can re-construct in imagination the battle of Waterloo, or can speculate on the form our political system will take a hundred years hence. But the past and future are not related to us in this way only. We can feel the causal efficacy of our own past and future. This must first be considered in relation to our immediate past and immediate future-that is to say, the event, or nexus of events, immediately preceding and suc- ceeding the event of the Central Agent occupying the specious present. If we are making a sustained effort- say, following out a train of thought-we are aware that the character of our present thought (its subjective form in Whitehead's terminology) is directly de- termined by the preceding thought. We are also aware that our present thought is not a terminus, but is directed towards continuing the previous line of thought into the future. Our present thought (more accurately, our present thinking) is an event, growing out of the previous event and leading to the next one. It is necessary to use other terms than memory and purpose to describe this causal relation of the present act to its immediate past and future, and we can employ Whitehead's terms prehension and subjective aim. An event of the Central Agent prehends its immediate past, and has subjective aim towards its immediate future. Let us consider prehension first. To understand this, it is necessary to remem- ber that the Central Agent is not an iso- lated temporal nexus of events, but forms a part of a larger spatio-temporal nexus of processes which constitutes the brain field, or psycho-physical field of Gestalt psychology. The Central Agent is one temporal series of such processes, pos- sessing a specially intimate coherence. But it is also in intimate relation with the surrounding processes in the brain, and through them, with all the processes in the body. Let us call the totality of processes contiguous to the Central Agent at any moment, its field (though here there is possibly a departure from White- head's use of this term). Prehension is the initial phase of the reaction of an event to its field of con- tiguous events. Every act of the Central Agent starts therefore by prehending its field of events, an important one of which is the immediately preceding event in the Central Agent itself. But the event has a certain duration; that is to say, certain internal processes have to take place in it before it is in a position to give rise to the next event, and subjective aim concerns this internal process. It is in this conception of what happens within an event itself that Whitehead departs from ordinary views of the nature of physical causation, which concerns the effect of one event upon another. In any causal series, each event initiates the next; this is physical causation. But each event occupies a certain duration, even if it is only the period of a light wave. What takes place within this duration is outside the physical causal series. Its physical causal nature is that of a process occupying a characteristic temporal and spatial extent. Ultimately, any causal series must be analyzable into a series of events, each the effect of a preceding event, and the cause of a succeeding event, with an interval between the effect and the cause</page><page sequence="16">2-70 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY which is the duration of the event itself. It is in this interval, that is to say, within the event itself, that teleological causation is to be looked for. According to Whitehead, every event (even such an elementary physical event as an electronic vibration) arises as the effect of a previous event, or nexus of events (its cause), and has subjective aim towards its own completion (satisfaction) which will make it a physical cause of the next event. This position can be supported partly by a consideration of our own elementary mental acts, and partly from the physical conception that a chain of physical causation, in its last analysis, is not continuous, but spatio-temporally quantised into finite units. Subjective aim fills the causal gap between the initiation of one event by a previous one, and its own initiation of the next event. As the term implies, it is teleological causation; this is not only because it is directed towards the completion of the present event, but because this comple- tion, or satisfaction, means acting as physical cause of other events. So sub- jective aim is aim at acting as the cause of other events, (or, following White- head's system more closely, aim at de- termining the character of other events). But it would seem unnecessary to invoke subjective aim if this was all that was involved. It would be enough to define an event as a process arising as an effect, and becoming itself a cause after a certain spatio-temporal interval, or in other words, that a "causal unit" is not in- stantaneous, but occupies a small region of space-time (Bertrand Russell). And there seems no evidence that anything more is required for a description of physi- cal processes, or of any process where there is no adaptation to ends. But where adaptation to ends takes place, something must happen within the event itself which will determine that the next event of which it will be a physical cause will be an event appropriate to that end. And this teleological factor is subjective aim. Whitehead, indeed, believes that subjective aim acts in this way even in physical events, but we do not need to follow him here, nor discuss his reasons for this conclusion. Let us return now to the consideration of purpose in the usual sense of this word. Long range purpose, like memory, de- pends upon a certain persistence of charac- ter of the nexus of processes forming the field of a series of events or acts of the Central Agent. Such purposes have the character of reference to the future; but this is no more nor less mysterious than the fact that memories have reference to the past. And mysterious or not, both are facts. But for science, the problem of purpose is not its reference to the future, but the causal efficacy of this reference, and this is to be found in subjective aim, which concerns the self-completion of each single elementary event which will make it a cause of other events. In conscious behavior the total field of proc- esses which is prehended by the present act of the Central Agent includes memories, sensations and so forth, which together form the action disposition of the organ- ism at the moment, and sets the charac- ter of the subjective aim. Subjective aim concerns only a single event of the Central Agent, and long range purposive action is due to a persistent character of the field which is prehended by a series of events constituting a stretch of the enduring object which is the Central Agent. In the higher organisms, this persistent character may be a mental image of the goal. But a consciously conceived pur- pose, or end in view, is no more neces- sarily implied in teleological causation than conscious memory is implied in</page><page sequence="17">PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY 17I every case where present action is in- fluenced by past experience. We have now to examine how teleolog- ical causation, or subjective aim, operates. As a preliminary, we may note that mere urge or drive, as such, over a series of events, or within a single event in the form of subjective aim, would not imply teleological causation. At least, it would be useless to invoke teleological causation merely for this. Science is only concerned with entities or functions that cause differences between phenomena, and un- less subjective aim means the potentiality of making a difference in subsequent events, it is meaningless. At the very least, teleology, if it is to be causal, must be concerned with existing possibilities of success or failure to achieve an end. We must approach this problem also from consideration of our own purposeful behavior. Suppose a man is suddenly confronted with a dangerous situation; that is to say, a visual sensum is prehended by the Central Agent in an event which has the subjective form of fear, with the corre- sponding subjective aim at escape. No teleology is concerned in determining the subjective form and the character of the subjective aim. These are the result of the configuration of the field of the Central Agent. But teleology is concerned with the mode of realization of the subjective aim. For the particular mode of escape- running away, standing still, various kinds of defensive action-depends upon the existing circumstances of the situation. There are various possibilities of action, of which one is to be selected as the one which appears the most suitable to the situation. This selection does not nec- essarily involve conscious deliberation. Of the various modes of escape, one is perceived as the most suitable. But possibilities refer to the future, and selection has to operate in the present. What is the present happening that is selected? We will call this thing which is selected, conceptual action (partly equiva- lent to Whitehead's "conceptual feeling of an eternal object"), noting that, as in Whitehead's terminology, conceptual does not imply conscious, though it does imply mental. The forms of conceptual action available to an organism depend upon its bodily organization. For the events forming the field of the Central Agent include those which are the "feelings" of its various bodily parts or sub-agents, caused and maintained by processes in these parts transmitted to the Central Agent. And since conceptual action is to issue in overt action, that is to say, in changes in these bodily parts, the possible forms of conceptual action are dependent on these feelings. The fact that teleological causation has such great scope in living organisms is due to the fact that they are nexus of sub-agents, and therefore rich in forms of conceptual action. The initial phase of an event in the Central Agent is therefore a prehension of its field of contiguous processes. This prehension gives rise to conceptual action -in fact, conceptual action is the form in which the field is prehended. But various forms of the general conceptual action of escape (in our example) are relevant to the situation, and the most appropriate of these has to be selected and the others rejected. Conceptual actions are pos- sibilities of overt action-but only possi- bilities, because until one has been ac- cepted by, or incorporated into, the event under consideration, the event does not become the physical cause of other events (in this case, the excitation of motor neurones). "Incorporation" means much the same as Whitehead's concrescence. It must be admitted that the word</page><page sequence="18">-7Z THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY "event" seems to have a less precise meaning when used in this sense than when used for an elementary physical event such as a light wave, the spatio- temporal extent of which can be precisely defined. The feature which the two events have in common is that each must be considered as a unit in relation to its causal effect on certain other events. There is clearly a sense in which an event such as we have described in the Central Agent can be analyzed into parts; but considered from the point of view of its causal action in exciting motor neurones, the whole process is a unit. For the selection of the most appropriate form of conceptual action must be considered in relation both to the origin and termination of the event. Subjective aim sets the course of the event from its origin as a prehension of a field of events containing a particular visual sensum, to its comple- tion as the physical cause exciting the motor neurones. It is for this reason that teleological causation is located within events, and physical causation at, so to speak, the junction of events. White- head, as already mentioned, finds it neces- sary to ascribe prehension, subjective aim, and satisfaction even to elementary physi- cal events. But without going into this, the comparison with elementary physical events at least seems to show that even in that sphere we have to deal with physical causal units, or processes, which are not instantaneous but occupy a finite region of space-time. Thus no principle of physical causation is violated by locating teleological action between the effect of one link and the cause of the next link in the causal chain. Perception is a conscious prehension, where the objects prehended are sense data, or sensa, provided by the sensory receptors. Conceptual action is simply the conative (rather than the cognitive) aspect of how the object is prehended or perceived. "Perception in its primary form is consciousness of the causal efficacy of the external world." (Whitehead, i92.9, p. I69). I have already discussed this in connection with imagined action, which, when applied to a single event, is conceptual action. But it tends to con- fuse the issue to use the special term perception only for the prehension of sensa in the usual meaning of that word. For the processes giving rise to bodily pains and fatigues-in fact, any happen- ings in the "field" of the Central Agent- are perceived in this sense. This means that our own immediate past (the previ- ous specious present) is also perceived. Whitehead (I933 calls this non-sensuous perception. It is important to remember that teleology is not concerned in the origination of conceptual action. A man perceives an orange as something to be eaten, or a rabbit perceives a dog as something to be avoided, because it is their nature to do so-natures which have been deter- mined by their whole past histories, onto- genetic and phylogenetic. If I am trying to solve an intellectual problem, ideas, more or less appropriate, arise in my mind. But these ideas-which are forms of conceptual action in which the conative aspect is at a minimum-arise spontane- ously, so far as my will is concerned, according to the psychological principles of association. Teleology is involved in the admission or rejection of these ideas according to whether or not they are consistent with the subjective aim of the event in the Central Agent which has prehended them. In a train of thought, the adaptation of means to end is carried out by selection of conceptual action which does not lead to overt action. That is to say, the completion of each event of the Central</page><page sequence="19">PURPOSE IN BIOLOGY 273 Agent determines the character of the next event, but does not excite any motor neurones. In conscious thinking, the nexus of successive events of the Central Agent is perceived (in Whitehead's ex- tended meaning of the term) as consciously imagined action, in which, however, the conative aspect may be reduced to a minimum. Typically, thinking is con- cerned with universals, because adaptive behavior is a fitting of a generalized type of behavior to a particular situation. To quote from Wolters ("On conceptual thinking," 1934): The problem of universals (confronts) us in animal behaviour as certainly as in human. A dog recog- nises any dog as a dog and any cat as a cat, as is clear from the appropriate direction of activities towards members of the two species. . . . The universal is found in the behaviour of the creature. . . . There is a readiness, or preparation, for activity, and it is gen- eral in the sense that it is available for a number of situations not completely identical. . . . Where we find this incompletely specialised readiness it is per- haps permissible to call the resulting behaviour ''conceptual'' in the case of animals as much as of human beings. The name is less important than the recognition that there is a mode of reaction common to men and animals which must be accepted as general in character, but which does not involve the recall to consciousness of any content. We have discussed teleological causa- tion mainly in relation to the events con- stituting the Central Agent; but the argument must be applied, in its degree, to all the living agents which constitute the nexus which is the organism as a whole, whether during embryonic devel- opment or as the adult: to all agents, that is to say, capable of adaptive action. The essential point is that teleological causation operates within the event itself, by selection of conceptual action. This is a phase of the incomplete event, between its origin as an effect of previous events and its own causal determination of the character of other events. LIST OF LITERATURE AGAR, W. E. I936.
