<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Concord Out: Henry Thoreau and the Natural Sublime Ralph W. Black In his 1844 essay "The Poet," Emerson writes: "Yet America is a poem in our eyes. Its ample geography dazzles the imagination." The lines are epigraphic for much of Thoreau's work, for the dialectic they suggest between the physicality of the earth and the imaginative transposition of that earth as language. An 1851 Journal entry goes to the heart of Thoreau's work not just with American geography, but as an American geographer - the literal meaning of which, "earth- writer," he would be the first to recognize and embrace: "A writer, a man writing, is a scribe of all nature - he is the corn &amp; the grass &amp; the atmosphere writing" [2:441]. There is of course a marked difference between being a scribe of the earth and being that earth's actual script, the first constructing a geography that dazzles, the second the dazzlement itself. Sharon Cameron reads this Journal passage as Thoreau's attempt to "make himself into the alienness he was forced to confront . . . ," and to thus give voice to that alienness (48). Such a conflation, the vanishing or erasure of the self, in the face of, or by a larger, more essential (natural) Other, and the concomitant voicing of that conflation (of that erasure), is the province, if not the crux of the sublime. This moment of substitution alluded to by Cameron - the object taking the place of the lapsed, or silenced, representation - is at the core of Kant's "mathematical sublime." Kant's version of the sublime moment is particularly concerned with the representation of the natural object, or the imagination's inability to represent that object. Kant uses the elusive term "subreption" to get at what I will argue is key to Thoreau's experience of the sublime (114). It is a term which Thomas Weiskel, among recent theorists of the sublime, has come closest to corralling: "The sublime dramatized the rhythm of transcendence in its extreme and purest form, for the sublime began where the conventional systems, readings of</page><page sequence="2">66 ISLE landscape and text, broke down, and found in that very collapse the foundation of another order of meaning" (22). As a writer of nature, Thoreau's fascination with the sublime stems directly from, and is a natural extension of, his on-going practice of the correspondential link between landscape and identity. An early Journal entry shows his interest in testing the limits of such a paradigm: "I should like to meet the great and serene sentence [of nature] which does not reveal itself, . . . which I may never with my utmost intelligence pierce through and beyond . . . , which no intelligence can understand" [1:330]. It is the wildness he is always imagining "out there," an idealized Other he can only intellectualize about (write, not meet) among the fields, woodlots, and stream banks of Concord - a terrain almost always construed by tropes of familiarity and correspondence. The sounds of dogs are everywhere audible in A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849), as are the signs of human domestication: "We did not have to travel far to find where men inhabited, like wild bees, and had sunk wells in the loose sand and loam of the Merrimack ..." (Thoreau 100). 1 His pond-side cabin opens onto metaphoric as much as actual space: "The low shrub-oak plateau to which the opposite shore arose, stretched away toward the prairies of the West ..." (392). That the landscape is depicted as "radiating" out from Thoreau from the start has everything to do with this proximity (387). Thoreau's correspondential eye in such a locale is predicated on the proximity of locus and logos. It is this familiarity, as both Eric Sundquist and Stanley Cavell have argued, that undercuts Thoreau's real experience of the wild. Logos rewrites locus : for though tropes of wildness might be coaxed or imagined out of the flux of pond ice, or out of seasonal change, the land itself is thoroughly imbued with such familiarity that both landscape and language are invariably "revealed." Nature's great and serene (and thus indecipherable) sentence is nowhere to be found. Towards the end of Waiden (1854), Thoreau is explicit about his hunger for a more authentic experience of American wilderness and primitivism than the well-plumbed depths of the pond can offer: [W]e require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable .... We must be</page><page sequence="3">Black 67 refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigor, vast and Titanic features, the seacoast with its wrecks, the wilderness with its living and decaying trees .... We need to witness our own limits transgressed. (575) The irony of course lies in the fact that Thoreau makes his way to these unexplorable and unfathomable regions, bent on exploration and on fathoming as many geographical and cultural truths as he can. The "unsurveyed" quality of this hoped-for land raises other questions for this author whose writing surveyed interior and exterior landscapes alike, and for this surveyor, whose transit-conscious eye mapped and essentially "wrote out" the delineament of numerous landscapes. The difficulties arise, and the cruxes of these excursions exist, in those passages where the tropes and figures he has utilized to such promising effect in Concord fall short, where the alienness of the land seems to inhibit or obscure his ability to represent it clearly.' The trip to "Ktaadn" in 1846 takes him into the heart of a "bran-new country," a "wholly uninhabited wilderness," where human limits (of psychology, of language) might be transgressed. The sublime otherness of the mountain is initially detectable in its distance from the party and the animation Thoreau sees in it: "At length we reached an elevation sufficiently bare to afford a view of the summit, still distant and blue, almost as if retreating from us" (636). As place, it is both physical and metaphysical. While the Concord party is within imaginative reach of human settlement, Thoreau levels his attention (often critically), at the ecologically destructive confluence of nature and culture. The Indians of Oldtown fall far short of his portrayal at the end of "Ktaadn" of the noble savage living in "the primitive age of the world," and of the loggers who strike him as hell-bent on "[driving] the forest all out of the country, from every solitary beaver swamp, and mountain side, as soon as possible" (595). As they move further into the woods, Thoreau attempts to familiarize the strangeness of the land by importing into it a Concordian rhetoric - a moose is measured by its similarity to a horse and a cow (635). Species of trees and plants are similarly connected, by memory, to their Concord cousins. His reliance on metaphor gives way to a more genre-specific representation as the rocks on a hillside are depicted as "flocks and herds that pastured, chewing a rocky cud at sunset . . . without a bleat or a low" (638). He</page><page sequence="4">68 ISLE arrives in the wild and relies, at least partially, on a pastoral imagery to make his way through it. This anthropomorphic construction, of a comfortably New England stripe, allows him to superimpose the known on the unknown. But there is a point during the journey at which the physicality of the terrain asserts itself, essentially rendering Thoreau's Concord-constructing tongue useless. Human figurations are left behind as the party is twice "buried" in the woods, crossing "the most treacherous and porous country I have ever travelled" - treacherous because porous: a land which engulfs even before the mountain is ascended (367-68). But this notion of burial is temporal as well as spatial (that is, geographical), as well as rhetorical. Katahdin is frontier for Thoreau, "the unhandselled globe," and frontier, that ideal of nationhood, is the future. That Thoreau imposes a rhetorical Concord (and Cambridge) on this frontier reflects his inability to relinquish the past - that set of known and familiar artifacts that allow him (as Wendell Berry would have it) to know where he is on the globe because he knows who he is - or at least what books he's read. But the perspective shifts when he is "buried," the landscape now more transformative than it is transformed. As presence , Katahdin demands an exclusively present attention, negating the usefulness of the interpretive "texts" Thoreau has carried with him. As Ronald Hoag has argued, Thoreau's representation of his time on Katahdin has far more to do with an exuberant experience of the sublime than it does with a moment of transcendental angst or disillusionment, or with an undermining presence of divinity - as other critics of the passage have suggested (Hoag 33). Clearly, Thoreau has a strong sense of his own trespass on the mountain and the transformative power of such an elemental world, a world almost identical to the one he imagines towards the end of Waiden : It was vast, Titanic, such as man never inhabits. Some part of the beholder, even some vital part, seems to escape through the loose grating of his ribs as he ascends. He is more alone than you can imagine. There is less of substantial thought and fair understanding in him, than in the plains where men inhabit. His reason is dispersed and shadowy, more thin and subtle, like the air. Vast, Titanic, inhuman Nature has got him at disadvantage, caught him alone, and pilfer him of some of his divine faculty. (640)</page><page sequence="5">Black 69 Katahdin is mythologized not only by the pantheon Thoreau imposes on it in his efforts to "understand" the place, but by the physical presence, or lack of presence, he experiences there - the "cloud-factory" that obscures all but fleeting glimpses of the mountain's materiality. The above passage suggests how the human presence mimics the material, the loose grating of the ribs echoing the porous quality of the ground mentioned earlier. Thought, reason, and understanding vanish because they are overwhelmed by the physical: locus rewrites, and ultimately silences, logos. The tension of the experience is enacted by the pairing, and repetition, of opposing images: the vastness of the land, and the solitary beholder's notion of the uninhabitableness of that land. The divine faculty that is "pilfered" from the poet (this is no grand larceny), is his ability to stake an actual, as well as a rhetorical, claim there - an essential faculty for a writer who concerned himself so much with tropes of settlement and dwelling. His inability to construct a correspondential footing on the side of the mountain is not about a loss of faith or self; it is the poet running out of language. The culmination of this passage raises further questions about Thoreau's relation to (and his ability to construct a relation to) this landscape: I stand in awe of my body, this matter to which I am bound has become so strange to me .... What is this Titan that has possession of me? . . . Think of our life in Nature, daily to be shown matter, to come in contact with it, - rocks, trees, wind on our cheeks! the solid earth, the actual world! the common sense! . . . ." (646) The "Contact! Contact!" which culminates the epiphany challenges a crucial question in the Journal : "Is it not as language that all natural objects affect the poet?" What kind of contact can Thoreau make without language-as-mediator? Many critics have suggested that his cry of "Contact!" is about frustration or inability, a failure of his transcendental faith. My own sense is that Thoreau's rhetorical silence here, his inability to author contact, becomes ironically the very authentication of an experience of the wild he has been after all along. What he recognizes and finally connects with is the validity of his silence in a topography that subsumes utterance. Katahdin is no tabula rasa onto which he can readily inscribe the pose of his humanity; it is in fact a Presence (a presentness), which stands firmly against such an act of inscription. The mountain is its own telling.2</page><page sequence="6">70 ISLE As the real displaces the ideal, Thoreau is left with a resonant and essentially Whitmanian moment of contact between his own body and that of the mountain. In an 1857 letter to Harrison Blake, he says: "You must ascend a mountain to learn your relation to matter, and so to your own body, for it is at home there, even though you are not. It might have been composed there, . . . but your spirit inevitably comes away, and brings your body with it, if it lives" ( Correspondence 497). The body composed by the mountain: the notion inverts Stevens' "The Poem That Took the Place of the Mountain," in which the pines, rocks, and clouds are "recomposed," "word for word," enabling the poet to find "the outlook that would be right,/ Where he would be complete in an unexplained completion" (Stevens 512). It recalls as well an earlier Journal entry wherein the shifting emphasis in the relationship is clarified, the author posited as the interpreted text: "Though the pleasure of ascending the mountain is largely mixed with awe, my thoughts are purified and sublimed by it, as if I had been translated ' (my emphasis) (10:144). To revise the earlier Journal passage that I began with, Thoreau finds on Katahdin a place where he can relinquish his claim as scribe and become, finally, the mountain &amp; the clouds &amp; the wildness writing. Similar rhetorical inversions brought on by encounters with wilder, unfamiliar, and transformative topographies, are found in other of Thoreau's work, most abundantly in the Journal . The wonderful depiction of his ascent of a "dream mountain" echoes much of the vocabulary we've been looking at: First, the recognition of trespass, "It can never become familiar; you are lost the moment you set foot there . . . "; then a sense of the materiality overwhelming and finally eradicating the human: You know no path, but wander, thrilled, over the bare and pathless rock, as if it were solidified air and cloud. That rocky, misty summit, secreted in the clouds, was far more thrillingly awful and sublime than the crater of a volcano spouting fire . . . (10:141-44) It is here that the poet becomes "purified" and "translated," though the image of the fire-churning volcano - and the simultaneity of creation, destruction, and sacrifice that it suggests - adds particular weight to the awe and sublimity that fills him. "It is," he says, "as if you trod with awe the face of a god turned up." His climb of Mount Monadnock (I like how</page><page sequence="7">Black 71 the word "nomad" lingers in the mountain's name . . .) presents similar images of dislocation: The rocks and valleys and bogs and rainpools of the mountain are so wild and unfamiliar . . . that you do not recognize the one you left fifteen minutes before. ... You would need to ramble about it many times before it would begin to be familiar. ... So that it has the effect of the most intricate labyrinth and artificially extended walk. [10:473-74] But this is not just about a failure of topographical recognition - "wild" and "unfamiliar" are significantly paired as modifiers of both physical and imaginative space. For all its physicality, Monadnock offers tenuous (imaginative) footing for Thoreau, a fact that compels him to reach for the appropriate imagery in another, recollected, landscape: "It often reminded me of my walks on the beach, and suggested how much both depend for their sublimity on solitude and dreariness. In both cases we feel the presence of some vast, titanic power ..." (10:473). Thoreau's interest in the sea, and the physical and rhetorical margins he confronted there, is key to our understanding of his larger project of deciphering the common ground of geography and epistemology. For it is at the ocean where tropes of alienness and the familiar are alternated and juxtaposed in ways most similar to "Ktaadn." Much of Cape Cod (1865) is written in what the poet Richard Hugo would have called "the key of wreckage," as there are, at last count, close to eighty formulations of the word "wreck" - as noun, verb, or adjective - in the book. As John Lowney has recently argued, Thoreau's method for finding a language suitable to such a landscape is to incorporate a variety of genres and discourses - travel narrative, science, historiography, reportage - as a way to construct a footing (actual and rhetorical) on the shifting sands (actual and rhetorical) of the shore (245). Occasionally, Thoreau denies, and attempts to tame, the vastness of the sea directly, by squinting it down to a kind of Waiden: "... it was not grand and sublime, but beautiful as a lake" (861); and "... the Atlantic itself . . . [under] a still closer inspection, . . . would not turn out to be but a small pond" (895). It is twice equated with a country pond, twice with what Thoreau calls "a larger lake," and is imaged once as being "as civil now as a city's harbor" (936). Human activity also serves to tame the sublime: "the sea there was not wild and dreary in all respects, for there were frequently a hundred</page><page sequence="8">72 ISLE sail in sight at once ..." (931). His interest in the settlements along the Cape works in similar ways. They make him enact a literal turn away from the unknown quantity of the sea, and they enable him to displace his own oceanic encounter with theirs, living vicariously through their familiarity: "The sounds which the sea makes must be very significant and interesting to those who live near it" (916). But Thoreau cannot finally avoid the handbill that greets him as he waits for his ship in Boston: "'Death!' one hundred and forty-five lives lost at Cohasset." Thoreau practices a kind of detached, scientific method in his renderings of the human carnage washed up on the beach, a macabre flotsam told by the detail-oriented eye of a natural, or supernatural historian: I saw many marble feet and matted heads as the cloths were raised, and one livid, swollen, and mangled body of a drowned girl ... to which some rags still adhered, with a string, half concealed by the flesh, about its swollen neck; the coiled-up wreck of a human hulk, gashed by the rocks or fishes so that the bone and muscle were exposed, but quite bloodless, - merely red and white, - with wide open staring eyes, yet lustreless, dead-lights. (853) Perhaps his apparent ability here to intellectualize more readily than he did in Maine, is brought on by the proximity of human habitation - "I saw that the beauty of the shore was itself wrecked for many a lonely walker there, until he could perceive, at last, how its beauty was enhanced by wrecks like this, and it acquired thus a rarer and sublimer beauty still" (857).3 If Thoreau makes himself into an artist, or theorist of the sublime here, it is because he recognizes in his retreat from the actual to the aesthetic a way to hold on, to keep grounded. His negotiation, or navigation between the ebb and flow of life and death, settlement and wreckage, what the sea takes in and what it heaves back up onto the shore, is appropriate precisely for the flux of the land- and sea-scapes enacted. The ground becomes tenuous for the walker and writer alike: "The annals of this voracious beach! who could write them unless it were a shipwrecked sailor?" (963); and, "The restless ocean may at any moment cast up a whale or a wrecked vessel at your feet. All the reporters in the world, the most rapid stenographers, could not report the news it brings" (978). The sea becomes, like Katahdin and Monadnock, "naked Nature, - inhumanly sincere, wasting no thought on</page><page sequence="9">Black 73 man . . . ." As such, it contradicts itself, at once as a "vast morgue . . . [where] carcasses of men and beasts together lie stately up upon its shelf, rotting and bleaching in the sun and waves . . . and, too, as a place where one realizes, finally, "that we, too, are a product of sea-slime" (979). Thoreau's depiction of the sea as a place "where everything seemed to be gently lapsing into futurity," calls to mind Ishmael on the mast-head, "lost in the infinite series of the sea ..." where "a sublime uneventfulness invests you . . . ", and . . . lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half- seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. (Melville 140) But where Ishmael is criticizing, at least implicitly, Emerson's "oversoul," Thoreau is embracing, unknowingly of course, Federico Garcia Lorca's "Duende," a theory of art, a kind of Muse, a creative impulse that comes "like ... a mental wind blowing relentlessly over the heads of the dead, in search of new landscapes and unknown accents; . . . announcing the constant baptism of newly created things" (Lorca 53). Though there is no one reverberating moment of contact in Cape Cod where, as with Kant's "subreption," logos and locus exchange places or collapse into each other, there is a sense that the sea's insistence on, and Thoreau's numerous encounters with wreckage, metaphoric and actual, lead invariably to similar questions about a dialectical relation between text and terrain. Thoreau remains the primary forebear for American nature writers not just because he offers a language and form with which to represent the confluence of nature and culture, but because he challenges himself both epistemologically and geographically. Like Odysseus carrying the paddle into the backcountry of Ithaca, Thoreau travels to those places in the world where his language for representing that world prove insufficient. His silence allows him to listen, and to embrace the not-knowing as few of his progeny have done. The listening, in turn, enables him to recognize and name the</page><page sequence="10">74 ISLE silence, and its meaning, thereby unmasking his own fiction. By recognizing the legitimacy and, indeed, urgency of his experience, Thoreau, like Lorca, sees into the baptismal heart of inundation and subsumption, and the silences they demand, and he comes out remade, with a new way to tell of it. Notes Quotations from Thoreau's prose, exclusive of his journals, is from the Library of America edition of his work, published in 1985, as noted in the bibliography. Subsequent citations will be noted parenthetically in the text. 2Thoreau's recognition here that his silence gets closer to representing the object than his normative mode of representation ever can is key to his growing understanding of a dialectic between landscape and language. Merriwether Lewis has a similar moment, in June of 1805, when he tries to describe the "sublimely grand specticle" of a Missouri River waterfall: after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw my pen across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind .... (In Bergon, 161). Such "wreckage" was not limited to the shores of Cape Cod for Thoreau. In 1850, he described the shore of Fire Island, NY (where, at Emerson's request, he had gone to search for the body of Margaret Fuller), as being recognizable almost solely by the "relic of a human body" he found there: "It reigned over the shore. That dead body possessed the shore as no living one could. It showed a title to the sands which no living ruler could" (Journal 2:80).</page><page sequence="11">Black 75 Works Cited Bergon, Frank, ed. The Journals of Lewis and Clark.
