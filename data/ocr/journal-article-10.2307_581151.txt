<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 INTRODUCTION This year my report deals mainly with the work of the years 1995, covered in the latest Deltion Chronika (vol. 50), and 2000, based on the Ergon of the Archaeological Society for 2000 and reports which have been sent to me. We have man- aged to catch up on AEMTH volumes 10-12. The annual report meeting of the Archaeological Service in 2000 had to be postponed from April to June because of the general election in April. It therefore came after the text of 'A in G' for 1999-2000 was closed. A summary record of the meeting: 'The work of the Ministry of Culture in the Sphere of Cultural Heritage' has been used here and abbreviated as Epyov YnnO (to distinguish it from the Ergon of the AS). I have also tried to catch up this year on vol. 2 for 1998 as well as vol. 3 for 1999, but there are still gaps (mainly Central Greece and the Peloponnese). This is a publication not widely available, and it does seem worth the effort to pass on early telegraphic announcements of the principal activities and dis- coveries of the Archaeological Service. I again ask for com- ment, and assure readers that copies of vols. 1-3 are available in the BSA library. No report meeting has so far been held in 2001 (for 2000). For the Deltion Chronika, references to the current volume are given by page number if possible, and without the volume number; references to earlier volumes include the volume number. My work on these sources has been greatly facilitated by the contributions of a number of Members and Students of the School resident in Greece: Eleni Hatzaki (Crete), Iphigenia Tournavitou (prehistoric to Roman central and southern Greece), David Turner (Byzantine Greece, except Crete), Anna Stellatou (NW Greece and the Ionian Islands), Lucy Valassi, Katerina Panagopoulou and Despina Christodoulou (northern Greece) and Rosie Roumelioti (Thessaly and the islands). Penny Wilson provided the bibliography; Alexandra Villing and Anne Blackman helped with translations; Helen Fields with editing and sequencing the text and Vicki Tzavara with typing. I am most grateful to all of them. I should like to add particular thanks to Jill Carrington Smith who provided impec- cable summaries on northern Greece for a number of years; I miss her contribution this year. I continue to receive favourable comments about the increased number of illustrations, and much appreciate the continued generous support of the Hellenic Society towards the cost of publication; in order to avoid excessive costs the num- ber of illustrations is somewhat reduced this year. For an explanation of the types of field work carried out in Greece and their forms of publication, and the other sources of information on which the compiler of 'A in G' can and must draw, I once again refer the reader to the masterly introduction by Hector Catling to his last contribution (AR 1988-89, 3-8). The economic and touristic development of the country still provides a threat to the cultural and natural heritage of Greece, with pipeline construction, the doubling of the railway track from Athens to Thessalonike and beyond, major new motor- way projects such as the Egnatia Odos, harbour enlargement and marine construction; the Archaeological Service makes heroic efforts to limit the damage. Work on the Athens airport and the Metro draws to an end, and this year we have a publi- cation of finds made in the airport area (Mesogaia), but Greece now faces a crash construction programme to prepare for the Athens Olympics in 2004. The cause celebre this year has been the proposal to hold the rowing events at Marathon, with the construction of a basin in the marsh at Schoinias. Despite determined opposition, particularly by the Archaeological Society, this project seems to be going ahead. The Parthenon Marbles have remained in the headlines, with new proposals for a Museum of the Acropolis, and the unification of archaeological sites in Athens continues to make progress, with the closure of Odos Dionysiou Areopagitou along the south side of the Acropolis. The outstanding archae- ological find of the year was that of a very early kore at Sellada on Santorini (see below). Many exhibitions have been held this last year. My person- al selection is: 'Greek Gods and Heroes in the Age of Rubens and Rembrandt' (Athens); 'Mother of God' (Athens); 'Neolithic Epirus' (Ioannina); 'The two Naxos cities' (Athens and Naxos); and a exhibition to mark the 60th anniversary of the death of John Pendlebury, in the Battle of Crete (Knossos). On the last two I must declare a personal interest! Museum openings have included the New Pieridis Museum of Ancient Cypriot Art in the Athenaida; the Mitsotakis Collection in Chania Museum; and the re-opening of Eleusis Museum. Conferences have covered a wide variety of subjects, for example: 'Attic Inscriptions' (Athens); 'Byzantine Sculptures, 7th-12th Ct' (Athens, with a follow-up exhibition in Naxos); 'Piraeus: History and Civilization' (Piraeus); the Sixth Congress of Peloponnesian Studies (Tripolis); 'Glass' (Rhodes); the Fourth Congress of Boeotian Studies (Livadeia); 'The Perception of Time' (Monemvasia); 'Ancient Helike' (Diakopto); 'Roman and Early Christian Crete' and 'Knossos: Palace, City, State' (both in Herakleion). The BSA celebrated 100 years of excavation at Knossos, and the ASCS 100 years of work in eastern Crete with events, exhibitions and conferences. Again the National Research Foundation organized an inter- esting lecture series - this time on Balkan Prehistory. This year Mr Evangelos Venizelos again became Minister of Culture; Mrs Lina Mendoni remained Secretary General of the Ministry and Mr Lazaros Kolonas remained Director General of Antiquities. Mr Evangelos Kakavoyiannis retired as Director of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, and was succeeded by Mrs Nicoletta Valakou-Divari - we wish them all well. We report with sadness the deaths of notable figures in Greek archaeology: Pierre Demargne, Nicholas Hammond, William A. McDonald, Mervyn Popham, Steven Runciman and Hans Walter.

Camp, II (ASCS) reports on the 2000 sea- son of excavation: 'Excavations were carried out in three sections, two to the NW and one to the SE of the agora square. Section BZ (Figs. 1 and 2). In this section, we continued to expose the remains of the Byz settlement of the 11th Ct AD encountered immediately under the debris of the modem build- ing demolished in the summer of 1997. The plans and strati- graphy of the houses were greatly clarified this season, with three distinct floor levels indicating successive refurbishments. Several pithoi were more fully exposed, one with its mouth raised to function with a later floor. A tile-lined well was also uncovered and partially excavated, and should indicate the position of the courtyard of one of the houses. 2. Athens, Agora: Byzantine settlement  1.

Athens, Agora: early levels The picture of this Med neighborhood gathered in earlier years was enhanced this season: close-packed houses with no open spaces between them, provisions for considerable subter- ranean storage, and a hoard of bronze coins. The interpretation of this evidence is less clear. Are these troubled times, with have people crowded together for security, desperately hoard- ing supplies and coins? Or are times good, the many new houses reflecting a rising population, with ample agricultural goods needing storage, and extra money hidden away for safe- keeping? The present archaeological evidence allows either interpretation. The construction of the Church of the Holy Apostles to the S, and the Asomaton to the NW, perhaps favours the latter, happier view of Athens in the 11th Ct. Digging along the robbed-out Byz street wall, we encountered a substantial collection of bronze coins in a relatively small area. In all, some 130 coins were recovered. They are mostly illegible, but a very few are LR (4th Ct AD?) in date, suggesting that we have here the remains of a hoard, scattered as a result of later building operations. Alaric's invasion in AD 396 or possibly that of the Vandals in the 470s may well have been the occasion for the original deposition of the hoard. Section BE. Here we continued to explore early levels in and around the C shop building (plan: Fig. 3). Further cleaning of the two Myc tombs was done. Prof. Maria Liston began a preliminary analy- sis of bones recovered in the past two years and reports that one grave (K 2: 5) held the remains of at least seven individuals (4 adults, 3 children), including an elderly man who had survived a broken collarbone and several broken ribs. The other (J/K 2: 2) had at least two adult males, one adult female, and a child. 4. Athens, Agora: ostraka The last of the fill containing ostraka was also cleared, and another dozen or so were found (Fig. 4), raising the total to over 150 pieces and making this the third largest deposit of ostraka found in the agora. As with the others from this group, all the new ostraka were cast against either Themistokles or Xanthippos. Prof. James Sickinger (FSU) will be in Athens in early August 2000 to begin research for publication of the deposit. After a major operation by Craig Mauzy to stabilize the collapsing shaft, we were able this year to complete the exca- vation of the 5th-Ct well begun last season. The well was 1.20m in diameter and some 5.50m deep. A large pithos mouth had been reused as the well-head, fell into the shaft, and was found at a depth of about 4.50m. The upper dumped 5.

Athens, Agora: marble stele fill excavated this year included a handsome rf pelike, with the draped figure of a woman on one side and a draped youth on the other (Fig. 5). Unusual pieces included two late bf choai, one with Dionysos standing between two rams, the other with a draped woman carrying a tray being followed by a man blowing into a trumpet, and an intact cylindrical ves- sel of lead. An assortment of bg salt-cellars, askoi and lamps was also recovered, dating largely to the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the 5th Ct BC. The well may have gone out of use as a result of the earthquake of 426 BC (Thuc. 3.87.4 and 3.89), believed to be the cause of similarly dated deposits found behind the Royal stoa (Rotroff and Oakley, Hesperia Supplement 25).The lowest fill represented period-of-use and was composed mostly of thin-walled water jars of coarse, micaceous clay. Also recovered were numerous burnishing stones, suggesting some light industry in the area; the rela- tionship of the well to the adjacent shop building has yet to be determined. A fragmentary inscription found built into a later wall seems to be part of a previously known cavalry document recovered some 15m to the S in 1982 (G. Bugh, Hesperia 1998, pp. 83 ff.). Section EA. Here in the area of the Eleusinion, we cleared bedrock in several trenches to determine where it would be safe to found wooden walkways planned by our Greek col- leagues for the presentation of the agora park. For the most part the bedrock lies high in this area and we had only to scrape a few cm of fill, some Byz, some R, and some LH. In one of the levels near the post-Herulian wall we recovered the upper right comer of an inscribed stele of Hymettian marble (Fig. 6). Some 22 lines of text survive, preserving about half of each line, which originally contained some 33 letters. The letter forms and formulae suggest a date somewhere in the 3rd Ct BC, and a preliminary reading of the text suggests that it concerns Athenian relations with the city of Kydonia in Crete.' Athens city: the Metro. For a helpful plan see ADelt vol. 1 Fig. A (at end of volume). Agios Ioannis Station (Leof. Vouliagmenes). Within the excavated area (3.700m2), which belonged to the anc. deme of Alopeke, at a distance of ca 11-12 stades (2km) from the for- tification walls of Athens, a stream was discovered, running SE to NW, as well as an array of 15 retaining walls, probably asso- ciated with the banks of the stream. On the NE side of the exca- vated area were recorded the remains of a workshop area, of C date: namely, sections of two walls, marking the limits of the area, and part of a double-storey pottery kiln, which preserved the circular firing chamber (di. 1.75m), as well as part of the mouth of the stoking channel, with traces of intense buring. The pottery associated with the kiln, dated from the mid and 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC. Finally, along the NW side of the excavation area, a row of 11 tombs was excavated (7 pits, 2 tile-roofed graves, 1 lamax, 1 cremation pit), dating from the mid-5th Ct BC. Another stone cist-tomb, holding the skeleton of an adult male, contained a rf lekythos, with a farewell scene, attributed to the Klugmann painter (440 BC). Evangelismos station (Fig. 7). In the excavated area, N of the Rizare park, were discovered the remains of an aqueduct, a funerary peribolos, pottery workshops, and part of a cemetery, all associated with the main road of anc. Athens, leading E towards the Mesogeia region. The cylindrical terracotta aque- duct, running E-W for a length of 62m, was partly laid inside a rectangular rock cutting. It consisted of cylindrical sections (I. 64cm, di. 32cm), marked with painted symbols, letters of the alphabet, probably used as guides for the joining of the dif- ferent parts (Fig. 8). Individual sections were also provided with semi-circular holes on the upper side, which were covered with semi-circular fragments of tiles, for the periodical clean- ing of the interior. Judging by the extant letter forms on the dif- ferent sections, the aqueduct can be dated to the end of the 6th ^ ......... . . ...1... 7.

Athens, Evangelismos site: aqueduct section A 9. Athens, Odos Herodou Attikou site Ct BC, and can be safely identified with the Peisistratid water supply system (527-510 BC). To the N of the aqueduct was located a large stone-built funerary peribolos, running E-W, and built in the isodomic style. Although its W part was disturbed by later workshop activities in the area, its E part was preserved to a height of three courses. The interior of the peribolos had no graves, probably as a result of later interventions, judging by the marble fragments of funerary monuments found in the vicinity; but it contained a rectangular funerary base, and a second base was discovered a short distance to the E, on the same axis. To the S of the peribolos, a C grave can be dated in the 2nd quarter of the 5th Ct BC. To the N, and almost against the peribolos, were recorded three thin road surfaces, lying on the bedrock, the latest dating from the HL period. After the destruction of the peribolos, the area was apparently used as a workshop site, with two pottery kilns erected in its E part; only the firing chambers and a great num- ber of pottery supports were preserved. A third kiln was located in the W part of the site, a circular double-storey construction of impressive size (diamater: ext. 3.30m, int. 2.70m; pres. h. 2.20m). The firing chamber was subterranean, and was cut out of the bedrock, while the original mouth of the chamber was located on the NE and had an arched roof. In the last period of its use, the mid-3rd Ct BC, it was used as a lime-kiln. To the NE of the kiln a rock-cut aqueduct was discovered, covered with semi-circular tiles, joined with plaster and provided with rect- angular openings. Towards the SW the aqueduct, which was apparently associated with the workshop complex, descended abruptly into the bedrock, in the form of a simple cutting. Judging by the extant pottery (mostly lekanai, and cooking pots), the kilns were used from the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC. The E part of the excavated area was occupied by a ceme- tery, which extended under Leof. Vas. Sofias. It included 35 burials, 23 of which were tile-roofed, dating from the end of the 2nd Ct BC up to the mid-2nd Ct AD. Of the rest, three were marble sarcophagi, two were plain stone sarcophagi, and three were cist-tombs. Odos Herodou Attikou (Fig. 9). Excavations in this area revealed the continuation of the large R building complex, the LHL/ER cemetery, and the large R aqueduct first encountered in 1982-3 (ADelt 38, 23-5). The earliest archaeological remains comprise a section of the Peisistratid aqueduct, located below the floors of the R building and below the tombs (Fig. 10). One of the two parts investigated, running SW-NE, with a preserved length of 15m, was almost identical to the sections of the aqueduct discovered at the Evangelismos station (see above), except for the painted lettering, and can be dated to the same period. Of the second part, only the rectangular cutting was preserved, for a length of 9.63m. In the rich cemetery along the road to Mesogeia (see Evangelismos station), 35 graves were investigated, including cists, built cists, tile-roofed graves and kalpes, mostly looted or disturbed by the R building. Although they dated from the 1st Ct BC to the 1St Ct AD, the remains of numerous funerary ele- ments of LC/EHL date, incorporated in the later tombs, suggest the existence in the area of an organized cemetery of an earlier date. This year the S continuation and limit of the R building complex were discovered, including 15 more rooms, belonging to two different building phases, of the late 3rd/early 4th Ct AD and the 5th-6th Cts AD respectively. In one of the rooms were recorded ca 100 lamps of the 5th-6th Cts AD. The walls of four of the rooms preserved wall paintings of the later phase, with geometric motifs (Fig. 11), while below the floors were record- ed small cuttings, containing burnt clay, traces of paint, and lime, probably of workshop origin. 10.

The drains were of the usual types (terra- cotta, n-shaped and cylindrical, built and rock-cut), the major- ity dating from R and LR times. The most substantial find was a section of the large R stone-built aqueduct (late 3rd/early 4th Ct AD), revealed for a length of 26m (60cm wide, 1.34m high); into this aqueduct led three terracotta, n-shaped drains. This network, which has been encountered on many occasions in this general area, dates from the ER period. Among the portable finds, the most important discovery was a bronze LA head, lying in a deep rock-cutting (see cover illustration of AR 1999-2000). On the whole this area which, until the Hadrianic extension of the city to the E, lay outside the fortification walls, was used very early on for the location of cemeteries. With the extension of the city, and the construction of the new fortifications, sec- tions of which were found inside the National Garden (AE 1971, 31; ADelt 42,15), the area was used for the erection of a large building complex, with luxurious rooms, apsidal areas, marble cisterns, mosaic floors and wall paintings. Kerameikos station. Excavations along Iera Odos revealed part of a funerary peribolos wall and part of a cemetery, along the anc. road. In association with the peribolos wall, 49 graves were investigated (22 tile-roofed, 8 cists, 6 hut-shaped, 7 pit- graves, etc.), the majority looted. Another section of the same funerary peribolos, with 30 tombs (15 tile-roofed, 3 hut- shaped, 9 pits and 3 pot-burials), dating from the C to the R 11. Athens, Odos Herodou Attikou site: Roman building complex with wall paintings period, was discovered along the N side of the same road. Among the finds was an honorary decree of the 3rd Ct BC, involving a religious association, and honouring the curator (epimeletria) of the shrine of the Agathe Thea, for her dili- gence. Investigations in the area were not completed, for tech- nical reasons associated with the change of location for the metro station. At the junction of Odos Korae and Panepistemiou were recorded 62 tombs of the LR period, a well, four later walls, and two cisterns. The majority of the tombs (with the exception of 2 built graves, 5 pot-burials, and 7 surface burials) were hut- shaped, with a N-S orientation. The excavation has confirmed the N limits of the extensive cemetery, sections of which have been encountered on many occasions, outside the NE section of the walls of the city. In Odos Konstantinoupoleos part of the foundations of a C building was located to the W of the anc. road surface of Iera Odos. Close to the building was found a stone-built funerary peribolos which, like the building, was in use during the 5th Ct BC. Inside the peribolos, which contained a child burial and a cremation, a mud-brick destruction level was recorded, proba- bly representing the collapsed superstructure of the wall. Around the peribolos were recorded four burials (a pit-grave, a cremation, a tile-roofed grave and a pot-burial). Among the portable finds was an inscribed funerary stele, with the repre- sentation of a young child and the name NIKHPATOZ, dating to the third quarter of the 4th Ct BC. At the junction of Odos Chalkidikes and Iera Odos was discovered part of the N retaining wall of the anc. road (Iera Odos), in the anc. deme of Lakiades, as well as part of a ceme- tery, which extended along its N side and was mostly used during the 4th Ct BC. The retaining wall, of the 1St half of the 4th Ct BC, running NW-SE, was preserved for only one or two courses (1.05m high, 60cm thick), and for a length of 14.40m. Along the S side of the wall was located the anc. road, with a maximum width of 3m and with ten successive road surfaces. It was used from the 4th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct AD, while its use was interrupted during LR and EByz times. To the LR period was dated part of a R building, to the SW of the retaining wall, into which was incorporated building material from the latter, as well as a funerary column of Hymettus marble, of LHL date. N of the retaining wall, in a layer of clay, were discov- ered 43 tombs (pit-graves, tile-roofed, hut-shaped tile-roofed, clay lamakes, cremations and pot-burials) of C and HL date, in two groups. The SE comer of the plot was occupied by a row of six 7th-Ct BC graves, two of which were pot-burials, while two isolated 5th-Ct BC burials were located halfway along the retaining wall. The majority of the graves, extending along the whole length of the retaining wall, belong to the 4th Ct BC. At deeper levels were recorded levels associated with MH pottery. Theseion. In Odos Ephestion the excavated remains, dating from EC times to the R period, include an E-W section of an EC wall and a stone-built poros drain which, along with other sections of drains, foundations, part of a rectangular clay con- struction and a well with clay lining, for the storage of clay, belonged to a workshop area of the 4th Ct BC. This site sug- gests that the whole area, just inside the walls and the Piraeus gate, was widely occupied by pottery workshops. To a later period (R) belong parts of stone walls. (ADelt 29-42) Hadrian's Library. During the 1995 excavations in the area N and NW of the R propylon, it was observed that the marble steps on the N side had been removed at an unknown date. Within the substructure of the staircase and the R court, inside</page><page sequence="8">8 DAVID BLACKMAN the 12th-Ct AD church of Ag. Asomatoi, which had been built against the N facade of the R building and over the N part of the propylon, eight tombs of LByz date (1 3th-1 5th Ct AD) were located. Various architectural members of the church, includ- ing the remains of the W wall and part of the LByz peribolos, were also located in the area. The investigation of the LC/HL apothetes to the W of the S wing of the R building, was com- pleted, down to a depth of 1.68m below the level of the R court. A large part of the N peribolos of the library, as well as an Ott bothros and a pithos of the same date, were discovered at the site of the Mentes storeroom, which was demolished. To the E of the mod. storeroom, part of the poros drain cover was recorded, on the N side of the internal R court. (ADelt 22-24) Plaka. During rescue excavations in seven plots, in the Plaka area, were collected various architectural members, which had been incorporated in the walls of mod. houses. In Odos Mnesikleous, at the site of the SW part of the prodomos of the Hadrianic Pantheon (2nd Ct AD), other sections of which have been recorded in Odos Adrianou, part of a poros wall was discovered and two storage pits, built in the prodomos of the R building, and dated to the MByz-LByz period. (ADelt 24) National Museum. Apart from routine restoration work and the recording of antiquities in the various departments, the sculpture department in 1995 completed the re-exhibition of the R collection, the richest of its kind in Greece (153 repre- sentative pieces), while work was continued in the PR gal- leries, especially for the exhibition of the Myc finds from Mainland Greece, N of the Isthmus, and the Aegean islands. The museum also hosted an exhibition: 'From Medea to Sappho: Untamed Women in Ancient Greece', organized by the Ministry of Culture. (ADelt 1-7) ATTIKA Alepochori. On the main road from Megara to Alepochori, rescue excavations revealed a retaining wall, located on the saddle between the acropolis and the cemetery of anc. Pagai, and possibly related to an aqueduct discovered 4m to the N on a parallel course. The pottery associated with this wall dated from the LHL period; the wall may be part of the fortifications. (ADelt 54) Aspropyrgos. During construction work for the junction and flyover on the national road at Aspropyrgos, below the mod. road surface, the remains of an anc. road were recorded, proba- bly the anc. route connecting Athens and Eleusis, which lay on exactly the same line as the mod. road. The anc. road had in places four and in places nine road surfaces preserved. (ADelt 45) Brauron: A second season in 2000 on the acropolis of Brauron, under the direction of Klairi Efstratiou, concluded the investigations in the area of the old 1956 excavations, which were intended to re-examine a large Myc building that was, according to Papademetriou, of MH origin; only the N wall of this half-dug house was found (Fig. 12). An extension of the excavation uncovered the NW comer of another building dat- ing to the end of LH IIIB. The pottery from the abandonment/ destruction of the building covers the LH II-IIIA up to the LH IIIB periods. (Ergon 2000, 34-37) Dionysos. Two anc. tombs, a cist and a pithos burial, of the end of the A period, were recorded ca 6.5km E of Dionysos, at the site of Rapendosa. (ADelt 66-7) 12. Brauron: Mycenaean house Eleusis. Four rescue excavations were reported from the mod. town of Eleusis, including sections of roads, retaining walls, domestic buildings, workshop establishments and cemeteries. On the national road from Athens to Corinth, by the Magoula junction, were located the remains of an anc. road, running N-S, from Eleusis to the demes on Mt Pames to the N. Two phases of this road were recorded: the earlier phase (LA-C period) had three road surfaces, and a width of 5.55m; and the later phase (HL period) had four road surfaces of sand and gravel. An EH grave was located 150m to the E of the anc. road, the first grave of this period to be discovered in the area: a rectangular cutting, lined with a wall, and covered by a tri- angular stone slab. Ca 40m N of the old national road from Athens to Corinth, traces were discovered of another anc. road, running NE-SW, possibly connecting Eleusis with Megara and Corinth. Four road surfaces were recorded, as well as traces of the N retain- ing wall. The remains of a substantial retaining wall, running N-S, were discovered at the junction of Odos Makrygianne and Hatzedake, ca 200m N of the anc. site of Eleusis. The N half of the wall, built in the Lesbian polygonal masonry style, can be dated to the A period, while the S part was obviously later. To the W of the wall alluvial deposits had accumulated, over which were recorded ca seven successive, compressed layers of sand and gravel, in the form of road surfaces, testifying to intensive use of the area. To the E of the wall building remains were recorded, ranging from the LG/EA period down to R times. To the former period belonged trodden earth floors, with traces of hearths and ashes, a child pot-burial, and part of a stone wall. The C and HL periods were represented by a well of monumental construction, lined with exceptionally worked polygonal masonry, as well as a second, smaller well, by the interior face of the wall. In the same area was also investigat- ed an apothetes, containing interesting pottery of the EHL peri- od, to which also belonged a stone wall. Finally, during R times, the area was used as a cemetery, judging by the two rect- angular cist tombs discovered partly over the stone-built well. Building material from another substantial retaining wall, also built in the polygonal masonry style and excavated in other plots in the vicinity, was recorded in Odos Vyronos. The remains of two stone walls, as well as a deposit of R pottery, possibly the remnants of a nearby pottery kiln, were discovered in Odos Eroon Polytechneiou. In Odos Souliou was located the W part of an anc. ceme- tery, which had been investigated in the past, in the same plot (ADelt 47, 41-2); it consisted of three cist-tombs and four tile- roofed graves of R date.

Spitharopousi hill: workshop site Kalamos: Excavations in the cemetery church of Agios Nikolaos revealed the original floor (lime mortar and crushed brick), associated with the construction date and the painting of the narthex (end 13th Ct). Evidence for built benches dating to the same period was also uncovered. The floor in the sanctuary area consisted of reused marble slabs, many of which had been moved due to the long use of the church for burials; 13 coins were found, dating from Frankish/Venetian (1382-1400) to mod. A neck ornament (perforated, leaf-shaped medallion with two facing birds), a ring, buttons, beads and other similar objects were collected. Pottery included plain and glazed ware, sgraffito and painted. Two votive reliefs of the 5th-4th Ct BC were found re-used in the nave floor. (ADelt 73-4) Korone. Remains of anc. harbour installations were planned on the peninsula by the EMA. (Epyov YnnO 2, 151) Laureotike. Spitharopousi. During systematic surface survey conducted by E. Kakavogiannes to discover PC metalworking establishments (AAA XXII, 1989, 71ff), C remains were also recorded, the most prominent of which was a large workshop establishment for the extraction of argentiferous ores, located on the N slope of Spitharopousi hill, on the W side of the Souriza valley (Fig. 13). This installation (Workshop A), of 4th- Ct BC date, contained a huge open-air rectangular cistern in its E sector, provided with a staircase leading down to its interior (cistern 1), and a small cistern to the E, with its own staircase, a rare occurrence in Attic establishments (Fig. 14), from which the water would be channelled into the big cistern, when the small one overflowed, through an open-air channel. All visible surfaces were coated with waterproof plaster, of excellent qual- ity. The walls of the cistern were built of very large stones, so as to withstand the water pressure. Just NW of the cistern lay a large rectangular type II washery, which was fed with water from the cistern. The part that included the washing basin and the sloping floor was roofed with a stoa, supported by four wooden columns, the stone bases for which were found in situ. In the S part of the complex were located compartments for the preparation of the ores, prior to their washing, while to the W was discovered a wing consisting of a double row of rooms, probably intended as living quarters for the personnel. It seems that the complex was divided into two parts, the W part com- prising the living quarters and the E part the workshop instal- lations. Finally, one more open-air water cistern was recorded a little to the S of the living quarters (cistern 2), of earlier date. In the vicinity of the workshop complex were located mine shafts, piles of slag and subterranean water cisterns to the W, another metalworking establishment to the E, and the remains of an anc. road leading to Sounion, all evidence for the impor- tance of the site, which was at its peak of operation in the 4th Ct BC. The whole area is to be incorporated into an archaeo- logical park, within the national forest area of Sounion. (ADelt 61-4) W of Merkati hill and E of Spelia hill, at the site of Thorikos/Stephani, in the area of the anc. quarries, was locat- ed an extensive building complex (55.10 x 45.50m) of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC, consisting of a great number of rooms, a bath, agricultural annexes, as well as a R metallurgical kiln for small-scale smelting activities, formed out of the rock. At the highest point were preserved the foundations and part of the superstructure of a rectangular tower, while below on the W side lay rooms of various sizes: the floor of the largest was dec- orated with a mosaic-like arrangement, consisting of small longitudinal strips of marble, set in plaster. The bathroom lay on the E side of the complex, and had a waterproof plaster floor, as well as drainage channels. At the lowest point of the slope, a bee-keeping installation was found: a rectangular con- struction consisting of a long wall with upright transverse schist slabs, forming small compartments in which the hives were placed. At the site of Charakas, on a rocky height, a brief investi- gation in co-operation with Prof. H. Lohmann revealed the shape and the entrance of a circular tower, located on the W side of a farmhouse of the 5th-4th Cts BC, one of many in the deme of Atene. Along the mod. road from Santerina to Legrena, remains of anc. houses suggest that the anc. road was located ca 500m to the E. (ADelt 60-1)</page><page sequence="10">10 DAVID BLACKMAN 16. Marathon-Tsepi: apothetes 15. Marathon. Boriza: ellipsoidal structure Lavrion. Building remains of the C period were planned by the EMA. (Epyov YnH02, 152) Marathon. In the vicinity of the mod. settlement of Kato Souli were found architectural remains of the LC period (1St quarter of the 4th Ct BC). At the site of Boriza were revealed the remains of an E-W ellipsoidal structure (6.80 x 4.40m) built of river stones of medium size and enclosing a rectangular space (2 x 2.60m) with a possible entrance point on the E. (Fig. 15) The homogenous deposit within the structure contained frag- ments of carbonized wood, a few sherds of household pots, a few obsidian fragments and sea-shells. No floor surface was identified. On the S side, the structure lay on an earlier, thick deposit of dark earth, with many fragments of carbonized wood, decorated pottery sherds, a mass of animal bones (wild boar tusks, goat horns) and sea-shells. The recorded pottery suggests a LN date, although it is possible that part of the ma- terial belongs to the EH I period. Samples of the carbonized wood and bone will be subjected to C14 analysis. The original use of the building is problematical, since despite the fact that its architectural form suggests a funerary building, the lack of bones or cover slabs makes this highly improbable. It is pos- sible that the underlying deposit was the actual tumulus, while the stone construction was a funerary monument, but the pos- sibility that this was a house or a storeroom should also not be excluded. It was definitely part of a larger complex of build- ings. (ADelt 64-6) Marathon-Tsepi: A fourth season in 2000, under the direction of Prof. Maria Pandelidou-Gopha, completed the excavation of the apothetes of the EBA cemetery. Its dimensions are 2.60 x 3m and its walls are partially supported by dry-stone walling. As last year, from the apothetes were recovered a large number of broken pots, pebbles, a few stones and some small finds. In the upper layer was a shallow pit with many fragments of human bones. The apothetes had been used continuously and was not made up of differentiated archaeological layers. The vessels were deposited complete, and were then smashed with stones. The interval between one deposition and the next was not long enough for much earth to accumulate (Fig. 16). The vases were found in groups just as they had been deposited, sometimes one group overlapping another. Each group contained basins, bowls and small pithoid jars with con- ical neck, of Cycladic type. Sherds of other vessels, river peb- bles and stones were also noted near the groups. In the lower levels, a picture of the way in which offerings were made was provided by a lekane containing a bone, a small bowl and a pebble buried at the bottom, in a corer of the pit, with parts of a set of teeth and skulls of large animals immediately next to it. The vase fragments also give evidence for chronology and provenance. The shape and decoration of most vessels indicate that they are local EBA products, characteristic of the Marathon area. The decoration of empty and hatched triangles incised on Cycladic-type pithoid jars, and the discovery of dif- ferent shapes in the same group, illustrate the contemporaneity of all the material (Fig. 17). The discovery in the same context of vases that were till now considered to belong to different periods, creates certain chronological problems. An incised plate related to the ECyc II frying-pans was found broken inside vases dated to ECyc I. It is, therefore, clear that the undisturbed Tsepi material not only gives us information regarding the burial customs and beliefs of the ancients but also allows us the opportunity to clarify chronological and typological criteria for a short span in the EH period.

Megara: rescue excavations in the town and was completed by the beginning of the 4th Ct BC. A section of the stone proteichisma of the C fortifications was recorded in Odos Eupalinou, for a length of 10.35m. In Odos Byzantos, to the W of the Plateia Ero6n, the remains of six different buildings were investigated, ranging in date from G to EByz. The earliest structure consisted of six LG rectan- gular stone-built areas, of which only five were partly preserved at foundation level, so no traces of doorways were recorded. Near the SE comer of the plot were located two parallel walls, part of the great stoa of the 4th Ct BC, excavated by Travlos before the Second World War, below the then Plateia Metaxa. They were built of large rec- tangular poros blocks, 2.70m apart, the better- preserved N wall extending for a length of 12.40m. A short distance to the N was investigat- ed the SW part of a building (A), defined by two walls meeting at an angle, apparently contempo- rary with the stoa. After the destruction of the lat- ter, the area was occupied by a R bath installa- tion, two large rectangular areas of which were located in the E part of the plot, built over a large section of the LG building. To the W of the G building, part of a stone-built drain-pipe was unearthed, running NW/SE. Finally, in the NW comer of the plot, part of an EByz building was investigated. At the junction of Odos Demarchou Schina and Plateia Eroin, to the NW of the square, eight rooms of the R baths were investi- gated (Fig. 20).

A section of the lat- ter, preserved for a length of 8.70m, was excavated in Odos Korae (Fig. 19). The two faces of the wall consisted of two rows of large rectangular poros blocks, preserved up to 1.50m in length, while the space in between was filled with earth and small stones.

They all belonged to ancillary installations of bath complex, which should be probably dated between Hadrianic and the Severan period. In Parodos Kolokotrone was recorded part of an E] house (5th Ct AD), consisting of five rooms, one of which had a well preserved mosaic floor and a semi-circular ni (Fig. 21). The mosaic consisted of a series of crosses, forr by diamonds of a dark yellow colour against a black ba ground; between were rows of circular or rectangular mol the whole within a framework of spirals/meanders in black a white background.

Below mosaic floor in room A was discovered a rectangular s terranean stone building, with walls preserved to a heigh 1.80m and an earth floor; along its N-S axis were found monolithic square piers, preserved to a height of 1.8{ Judging by the pottery and bronze coins from the fill of building, which dated from the MHL and LHL period, it abandoned in the 4th Ct BC. The remains of another subterranean stone building, i dating before the MHL period, were discovered in O Mauroukake, while in Odos Koukoule were investiga the remains of workshops with two building phases, and ( third subterranean building (Fig. 22). The latter had a rect gular plan and an earth floor, but there was no evidence ( pier for the support of the roof. Here too the portable fi dated from the HL period. To the second building ph belonged two rooms (A, E) of a LR/EByz workshop. In rc A, along the E wall, were unearthed three built cisterns, of cular form with almost conical bases. To the E, in roon was located a shallow rectangular cistern, lined with wa proof plaster. Judging by the finds (a large number of pu shells) in an adjoining area (room F), the installations e: vated were used for the dyeing of cloth. Sections of tl walls with N-S orientation, and the N corer of a HL bu ing, were located in Odos Demosthenous. Finally, part ( large stone-built drain (74 x 48cm) running E-W, was rec( ed in Odos Palaiologou. Funerary remains: in Odos Agias Varvaras, in the ceme- tery lying N of the Pagai gate, 13 tombs were investigated, dat- ing from the 6th Ct BC to EHL, the majority being A (4 cists, 9 sarcophagi). In another part of the same cemetery, N of the anc. town, in Odos Alepochoriou, nine tombs were investigated (7 cists, 2 sarcophagi), dating from the 6th Ct BC to LHL, most- ly from the latter. The first row of cist-graves must have belonged to a single family. In Odos Stadiou, in the SW part of the mod. town, part of a cemetery of the 6th and 5th Cts BC was located. Thirteen graves were investigated (8 sarcophagi, 2 cists, 2 tile-roofed graves); six contained child burials. Among isolated finds, a single 4th-Ct BC sarcophagus was discovered in Odos 28es Oktovriou; a cist tomb of HL date was recorded in Odos Grammou; and three tombs (2 cists and 1 sarcopha- gus), of the 5th and 3rd Cts BC, were discovered in Odos Chaniou. Finally, to the S of the national road and 25m W of Odos Paches, during the construction of a fly-over, part of a new cemetery was discovered, comprising 13 tombs, all stone sarcophagi, dating from the 6th to the 4th Cts BC.

Piraeus: house on Odos Maurokordatou site or just lying on the levelled pile of stone chips/rubble, about to be prepared for transport. On the whole, the evidence suggests that the site had witnessed a cycle of heavy and deep quarrying activities. Traces of lighter, surface quarrying activities have been discovered at nine other sites: at the junction of Odos Omeridou and Makrygianne, the quarry, including extraction channels and hollows associated with the detachment of the stone blocks, was succeeded by habitation remains (two cis- terns). In Odos Androutsou, the quarry was of irregular form, with few worked areas, and was again associated with house remains, three wells, possibly cisterns, and traces of a hearth area (mud-brick wall, pottery fragments, ashes, burnt clay, etc.). Remains of an extensive quarry (extraction channels, half-worked blocks) of irregular form, were also located in Odos Propontidos. Part of another anc. quarry (extraction channels, piles of stone chips), partly destroyed, was recorded in Odos Kleisoves, and in Odos Oikonomou (half-worked blocks in situ). Finally, light quarrying activities have also been located in Odos Chatzekonstante, at the junction of Odos Ralle and Kleisoves, in Odos Karpathou, and in Odos Serangeiou. Traces of habitation: part of an interesting house of C-HL date was excavated in Odos Maurokordatou, as well as small sections of other houses. Two rooms of the main building were investigated, N of which lay the atrium (Fig. 23). The larger room, with a thick destruction layer of household pottery and roof tiles, was possibly the oikos of the house, while the neigh- bouring room was probably the andron. In the atrium were pre- served traces of stone paving, possibly of an earlier phase, also a secondary triangular area, a well, and two built cisterns. It is suggested that one more row of rooms lay to the N of the atri- um. To the S of the excavated rooms a long roofed corridor (roof tiles) was discovered, crossed by a drain which led to the main drain in the road, running along the house on the W side. The latter was a main artery of the Hippodameian system. The pottery dated the building to the 2nd half 4th/ 1 st half 3rd Ct BC. Remains of another LC building were discovered in Odos Kalliga, W of Munichia hill, including part of a corridor and two secondary areas, both used for food storage, related to ani- mal husbandry. A building of R date, facing a secondary road running N-S, and part of a drain crossing the road transversely, were excavated in Odos Philonos. A rock-cut cistern with two staircases, and a drain (80cm x 1.20m) lined with waterproof plaster, were recorded in Odos Chatzekyriakou; inside the drain was discovered an iron spade, probably _.2. left there during work on the extension of the &gt; drain. Other rock-cut drains, two anc. wells, one with 12 steps, three other wells associated with ;, three bell-shaped cisterns and remains of a drain, as well as another bell-shaped cistern, were record- ed at the junction of Odos Androutsou and Soteros, in Odos Botsare, Odos Kanare, at the junction of Odos Alkiviadou and Vas. Georgiou, and in Odos Botase, respectively. (ADelt 55-8) Rhamnous: B. Petrakos reports on the 2000 season in Ergon 2000, 15-24: 'Investigations at the fort, E of the theatre, were continued.

The rooms had all been destroyed in antiquity and finds were few. A cistern 7.50m deep, cut into the slope, was found in a court, with a tunnel at the bottom to increase its water capacity. Due to the soft earth, a cylindri- cal shape widening towards the bottom was preferred to the usual piriform shape (Fig. 25). A stele inscribed with a decree and re-used in antiquity as a threshold, was found amongst the stone fill of the cistern.

Rhamnous: cistern 26. Rhamnous: farmstead honours a general of the coast, whose name is not preserved, for his care for the defence of the fortress and the safety of the citizens, and for providing the fort with wheat. Another fragment of a stele was found outside but near the cistern, bearing an inscription inside a carved wreath in which Athenians serving at Rhamnous honour Dromeas - probably the son of the trierarch, Teisandros Eiteaios - for his services to them. The cistern of the S gate was partially examined, and among its stone fill was the left part of a votive inscription from which we learn that the general of the coast, Epichares, dedicated the strategion (head-quarters) to the Hero Archegetes and another divinity. This Epichares is probably the general who in 268/7 BC commanded the fort of Rhamnous and the coastal area during the first year of the Chremonideian war, and prevailed against the forces of Antigonos Gonatas that were besieging the fort. Epichares is known to have been rich and to have given donations to the fort in 268/7 BC. However, judging by the construction of the building, it is impossible for the headquarters to have been built during the Chremonideian war, and it may be that it hap- pened during a second, hypothetical term generalship of Epichares in 267/6 BC, before Rhamnous was captured by Antigonos in 263/2 BC. The marble top of a fine dedicatory table, from the shrine of Dionysos, as yet unlocated, was found as part of a courtyard floor of R date, inscribed with ipp&amp;O Atov6oo[)]. There is a great deal of evidence for the worship of Dionysos at the fort. A newly discovered dedicatory lamp base informs us that dur- ing the Archonship of Agathokles (106/5 BC) three soldiers of the garrison of the fort were victors in the Diogeneia and Ptolemaia at Athens. One final discovery was a farmstead in the plain of Limikos, next to the shrine of Agios Spyridon. The walls of the farmstead were uncovered, although its NE corer had been destroyed by the construction of a public highway in about 1973. It is a roughly rectangular building (17 x 26m) with a hypostyle (pillared) hall, small rooms with plastered walls and floors, and other long rooms, used to store crops (Fig. 26). The spacious and symmetrical plan of the farmstead stands in direct contrast to the cramped and sunless quarters of the fort.' Salamis. Kanakia. Prof. Y.G. Lolos (University of Ioannina) reports on the surface survey in the wider area of the Cave of Euripides and other parts of S Salamis which was continued in September-October 2000: 'The most important result of the 2000 survey was the identification of an extensive Myc settlement, preserving vis- ible architectural remains (stone foundations of houses and a succession of terrace walls) at the site of Kanakia on the SW coast of Salamis. This is the first large Myc settlement to be located on the island. On the basis of the evidence from the 2000 intensive survey, it seems to be a major centre of the 13th Ct BC, of considerable dimensions, that can be identified with 'Old Salamis' mentioned by Strabo (IX.1.9). The recent survey at the site comprised not only collection of surface finds, but also systematic clearing of visible foundations and retaining walls.</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 15 The Myc settlement at Kanakia extends over two contigu- ous heights, rising to 67m and 91m, just above the coast, and has access to two natural harbours. It consists of a main settle- ment (on the acropolis) covering an area of ca 12 acres, and at least two smaller satellite settlements. This is essentially a double acropolis, well-organized, with a street plan (Fig. 27). The clearing work on the Myc acropolis of Salamis was carried out in twelve sectors (A1-A3, B-I). The architectural ele- ments already uncovered at the site include: plans of houses of at least four different types; parts of two building complexes; two stone column bases; small tower-like structures; a succession of retaining walls; and a main road on the N slope of the acropolis, partly paved with stone, that led from the harbour to the higher terraces and somewhat recalls the impressive road ascending to the acropolis of Pellana in Lakonia (Th. Spyropoulos, in Sparta in Laconia (BSA Studies 4) p. 38 fig. 2.28). The settlement site at Kanakia presents excellent prospects for future research for several reasons. The earth deposits cov- ering the Myc building and other architectural elements on the acropolis are relatively thin. The site also appears to be practi- cally 'untouched' since its destruction (by fire?) and abandon- ment, early in the 12th Ct BC. There seems to be no building or other human activity at the site in later, historical times; its total abandonment, after LH IIIC:early, invites various interpretations, including serious threat from the sea. Finally, the whole settlement system, including the main quarter (on the acropolis) as well as the smaller quarters (or hamlets) is today found in public-owned forest land. Finds. Extensive clearing work on the Myc acropolis has produced a large quantity of pottery. The bulk of the material, consisting of decorated and plain sherds, is datable to LH IIIB and to the LH IIIB2/LH IIIC:early transitional phase (i.e. ca 1190/1185 BC). Four vases have already been fully or partly reconstructed: two tripod cooking pots (Fig. 28), two deep bowls and a pedestalled krater, bearing clear traces of burning. Identifiable in our material are at least 40 different vase-shapes. Of special interest are fragments belonging to five different bath- tubs (Fig. 29). Other finds include stone tools of various types, among them many querns, two clay animal figurines, a clay token (?) of oval shape, a handle fragment of a household vessel with an incised sign (potter's mark) and a large fragment of an oxhide copper ingot (Fig. 30) of Cypriot provenance, weighing 1.7kg and belonging to a type well known from the cargo of the Cape Gelidonya shipwreck of 1200 BC. It should be emphasized that after the discovery of oxhide ingots at Mycenae and Thebes, this is the first occurrence of the type at a centre of LMyc Greece. This last find, taken together with the other evidence gained from the 2000 campaign at the acropolis, offers some hint of the external relations and commercial links of this major island settlement in the Saronic Gulf. Its importance, within the context of the political map of Greece at the time of the floruit of the palatial centres, is expected to be fully revealed by the evidence from systematic excavation.'

After destruction of this sanc- tuary (probably by a severe earth-tremor) and the filling and -I " ' \ t 'J i lb S N. :"*S 0 O '20- levelling of the whole area in R Imperial times, the cult (also reflected in the well-known votive relief in the Archaeological Museum of Constantinople) appears to have been transferred to the adjacent cave, at a higher level. Thus, in the 2nd Ct AD, the cave at Peristeria emerged as a 'tourist shrine', a place of pilgrimage, frequented by Greeks and Romans alike, in vener- ation of the great tragedian.' Skala Oropou. In 2000 excavations under A. Mazarakis- Ainian concentrated on a large structure discovered in 1985, W of the G settlement. This has a rectangular enclosure 57 x 17.60m, with a total area of more than 1000m2, while the thick- ness of the walls (0.40m) seems inadequate to support a tall structure (Fig. 33). The superstructure was of the usual unbaked mud-brick. The excavator has identified the structure as an army camp for a garrison, an hypothesis supported by the width of the N entrance (2.60m), enough to accommodate sev- eral people at once. A small square room (2.60 x 2.60m), in the NW comer next to the entrance, was probably the gatehouse of the camp (Fig. 34). At the S end, the enclosure narrows and the entrance here was guarded by a tower of at least two storeys, judging by the thickness of the walls (0.90m). A little N of the tower two circular structures were found, probably for storage (Fig. 35). The entire complex (enclosure, gate-house, storage structures) dates to the early A period and the excavator tenta- tively links it with the Lelantine War in the 1 t half of the 7th Ct BC. It is proposed that a group of Eretrian cavalry was barracked there, since one anc. source links Oropos with Eretria. The lower levels in the S part of the camp, beneath the tower, yielded two elliptical G con- structions. Further E, a compact clay structure was found (3 x 9m) inside which the remains of a pyre with quantities of burnt animal bone were preserved, perhaps sacrificial remains. Other, older buildings of PG and G date are abundant in the area of the rectangular camp, and will take a great deal of effort to uncover. Inside one, remains of a ceramic kiln were found filled with ash and wasters (Fig. 36). It has been suggested . ,4 that, roughly in the middle of this sector, there was a stream running into the sea.

Another such pithos was found outside the N wall of the easternmost room. This structure may have served as living quarters for the priests. The second phase, associated with the decline of the basilica, involved five roughly-constructed rooms to E and N. Scattered burials were found to the N of the ancillary buildings. General finds included a small bronze coin of the later 5th Ct AD, a pithos rim with a 6th-Ct AD stamped inscription, and a lamp of the 3rd-4th Ct AD. (ADelt 71-73) Stavros Geraka. Part of a mud-brick wall, form- ing a corer with another wall cut out of the rock, and constituting the E half of a hypostyle hall, was discovered in Odos Zalongou. The hypostyle hall was apparently associated with the civic buildings of the Pallenis Athena sanctuary, the temple of which lies 50m to the W. At the junction of Odos Androutsou and Zalongou, the excavation of the foundations of the temple discovered in 1994 was continued: the W and N sides of the temple plat- form, part of the W wing, the E and N foundation walls of the cella, and the N wall of the prodomos were investigated. Among the portable finds were many bird-like figurines, while the majority of the pottery dated from the C period. (ADelt 67-8) 35. Skala Oropou: storage areas 36. Skala Oropou: kiln gulf.

On the floor of the S room the remains of several vessels were found along the W and N walls. These included black-burnished bowls, a number of vessels with EH III slipped decoration (among them 2 amphoras, 1 duck vase, 1 jug) as well as a magnificent red- burished jug.

Aigina, Kolonna: area E of acropolis wall The following conclusions can be drawn from the past three seasons' work at Mt Oros on Aigina: (a) The mountain summit appears to have been enclosed by a fortified settlement since MH times. (b) By the LA period at the latest, a Cycladic- type altar of Parian marble was erected in its centre, together with a small temple of Aiginetan poros. (c) The architectural remains on the N slope of Mt Oros can nearly all be assigned to the late 6th Ct BC. Only a three-sided stoa with open court- yard dates from the period when Aigina belonged to the empire of the Pergamene kings. The terraced area was the location for the banquets of pilgrims who ate and drank here after the sac- rifice on the summit. Both parts, the temple and the altar on the 41. Aigina, Kolonna: 'priests' houses' summit, and the ensemble of buildings on the N slope, were connected by a ceremonial road, which means that the terrace structure with its imposing ramp and ceremonial buildings can be interpreted as a kind of Pompeion.' Kalaureia Berit Wells (Swedish Institute) reports on the 2000 excavations in the Poseidon sanctuary: 'Our investigations continued inside and around building D. A row of bushes along the S wall of the complex were cut down to improve the view of the sanctuary from the road; this also enabled us to remove what we believed to be Wide's dump from 1894. Sorting through it we could verify that it was indeed the dump, mixed with blocks fallen from the wall and discarded tiles. There was no other archaeological ma- terial, which further underlines Wide's statement in his report in AM for 1895 that they found surprisingly little material at the site. A trench dug in the centre of the largest room of the build- ing revealed a cross-wall, dividing the space into two equally large rooms. Deep soundings in the W part of the building yielded information of wider interest. Wide believed that building D had two phases: first the stoa in the N was built in the 6th Ct BC; in the 4th Ct the back part was then added. Stratified material connected with the back wall of the stoa now proves that the stoa was erected in the early part of the 4th Ct and the rest of the building in the later half of the same century. This was built on fill underneath which late 8th-Ct pottery was found above bedrock. Further excavation in the building is needed to verify the results obtained during the investigation.' Kea Ioulis.

On the river bed was discovered a substantial terrace, possibly part of anti-flood works, while R and post-R remains have been locat- ed in the interior of the harbour. Orkos. In the Orlos area, at the site of one of the most important mines of miltos, halfway along the E coast of the island, a number of anc. galleries were recorded (photo- graphed), and the remains of a HL stone wall were located alongside the mine.

Kythera: field survey settlement, contemporary with the Kephala site, as well as traces of settlements of the LH and C periods. On the slope of the hill to the NW of the harbour was recorded a number of artificial terraces, of possibly PR date. (ADelt 24-26) Kythera The Kythera Island Project undertook its third season of intensive field survey and associated inter-disciplinary research in the summer of 2000. Dr Cyprian Broodbank (BSA), the project's overall director, writes: 'The season opened with the analysis of pottery from 18 previously collected sites, undertaken by Kiriatzi (Fitch Laboratory, BSA), Johnston (UCL), Vroom (Leiden) and Broodbank (UCL). This was supported by Kiriatzi's ongoing diachronic study of the technology and chronology of fabrics and pottery-making traditions on Kythera, using thin section ceramic petrology, clay sampling and replication experiments. The first major geoarchaeological field season was undertaken by Frederick and Krachtopoulou (Sheffield), assisted by Koussoulakou (Fitch Laboratory). This focused on coring for information on the palaeoenvironment and coastal change in the fluvial zones close to Kastri, detailed mapping of selected areas, and the preliminary study of terracing, soil movement and site preservation. A detailed topographic map of Kastri and ca 50ha of its surroundings was completed by a team under Conolly (UCL). In addition, Rackham (Cambridge), Moody (Baylor) and Conolly combined botanical fieldwork and satel- lite data to produce a comprehensive vegetation map for the island. The intensive field survey in 2000 covered ca 20km2 of which the total area tract-walked was 13.1km2 (Fig. 42). Fieldwalking concentrated on completion of two new transects (4) and (6), expanded coverage of the Palaiopolis hinterland around Kastri, complete coastal coverage of the extreme east- ern area of Kythera and infilling and exploration in the south- central region. Overall, the result is that in the N half of the sur- vey area, six 1-km wide transects, spaced 1km apart, now sam- ple Kythera's landscapes and environments from inland plateaux to maritime peninsulas, plus an off-shore inlet. Fifty- three new sites were found; including several further site des- ignations from previously walked areas, this takes the 1998-2000 total to 141 sites. A gridding team collected 22 sites. This total included the inland sector of Kastri, comple- menting work on the seaward sector in 1999 and raising the coverage of the site to over 1100 10 x 1 Om collection squares whose material, when fully studied, should substantially advance our knowledge of the site's history from the EBA until the present day. Overall, whilst confirming through further examples the reality of the settlement 'spikes' identified in 1998-1999 (EBA, Neopalatial, C and late Venetian to Recent), the 2000 season added important, hitherto unknown, dimensions to the chronological and spatial distribution of settlement on Kythera. Evidence for later N occupation grows incrementally if mod- estly, largely through the identification of probable FN pottery at certain EBA sites. Entirely new, however, in the 2000 season was the discovery of several small scatters, within 1-2km of Kastri, with material that is dominated by Minoanized fabrics and shapes with parallels in MM IA material from the 1960s Kastri excavations and, equally, of two large scatters of Protopalatial material, close inland from Kastri, that are sug- gestive of a clustered settlement focus in this area, at a time when most of the landscape was empty. These discoveries are chronologically intermediate between the well-attested EBA and Neopalatial horizons, and together they allow a more com- plete understanding of Minoan expansion on Kythera to be gained. In contrast, the 2000 season continued to confirm the paucity or absence of rural settlement from the Myc palatial 43. Kythera: pit with Neopalatial pottery</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 21 44. Corinth: Panayia Villa period until the 6th Ct BC, with LA material preceding the major C expansion. The HL and ER periods remain troughs in terms of rural settlement, but LR sites are commoner than was initially recognized, particularly in coastal regions. Byz and early Venetian-period material (12th-13th Ct onwards) is attest- ed, but remains quite rare overall. In addition, a small excavation in the Tholos area of Kastri was undertaken as a synergasia between the 2nd EPCA and Kythera Island Project, overseen by Tsaravopoulos and Broodbank, and directed in the field by Bevan. This involved excavation of rock-cut features and M pottery exposed on the surface of a dirt road that runs up the Kastri ridge inland from the area of the 1960s trenches. The depth of deposits had been heavily truncated by erosion and road building, but from two well-preserved rectilinear features, and other vestigial ones, over 200 Neopalatial pottery vessels were recovered (Fig. 43). The pottery is under study by Kiriatzi and Knappett, assisted by Kappa. By far the most common shape is the conical cup, many of which were stacked in rows, but there was also a range of other serving and drinking shapes, as well as forms such as kalathoi, blossom bowls and tumblers that closely match the assemblages from tombs at Kastri. Although the damaged con- dition of these contexts precludes decisive proof, the range of pottery and the rock-cut nature of the features suggest a funer- ary or funerary-related function, and they may plausibly repre- sent the remnants of tombs.' Paliochora. In 1999 the Australian Paliochora-Kythera Archaeological Survey began exploration of the broader hinterland of the Med settlement of Agios Demetrios (moder Paliochora) in N Kythera. Timothy E. Gregory reports on the 1999 and 2000 field seasons: 'The survey is intensive and diachronic in scope, but its major research questions seek to understand the settlement system in this part of Kythera since the foundation ofAgios Demetrios in approximately the 12th Ct AD. The 1999 season concentrated on the use of electronic technology (GPS combined with GIS) to record the now-abandoned agricultural landscape of N Kythera. This was designed to provide a kind of archaeologi- cal 'snapshot' of life at the time of abandonment, largely in the middle years of the 20th Ct. The 2000 season continued this work, but moved systematically into exploration of the more distant past of the survey area. During these two seasons, 365 survey units were investigat- ed systematically and 9,700 archaeological objects were count- ed. The project uses a 'low-impact' method of lL o analysis, in which most artefacts are described, photographed, and drawn in the field and then left ', essentially in situ. Of the objects observed, almost exactly one-third were described in detail. These TR ' range in date from EH to mod., with significant _j concentrations of PR, C, Med and early mod. ~-- material. Tentative conclusions suggest that the Med city ' of Paliochora should not be seen as an isolated set- tlement, alone in its defensible position, but as the centre of an agricultural system that extended broadly throughout the N part of the island. An important component of the project is a focus on the archaeology of the modem period (since 1798) and the integration of information from the import- ant local archives on Kythera. The project plans a study season in 2001, with limited fieldwork in selected areas.' Methana Vathy Megalochoriou. Submerged remains of the anc. city of Methana have been found along the shore. (ADelt 856) KORINTHIA Agios Vasilios. Timothy Gregory (ASCS) reports on the 2000 season: 'It was impossible to do any fieldwork on the site in 2000. Instead, all our efforts were devoted to the organization, pho- tography, and study of finds from the site. We have continued our understanding of this important Med site and plan to have a full report at the end of fieldwork in 2001.' Corinth. Guy Sanders reports on the ASCS excavations at Anc. Corinth in 2000: 'Excavations since 1995 in the Panayia Field, SE of the forum at Corinth, have uncovered the remains of a MR town house with mosaic and marble floors, buildings of the 6th Ct including a small bath structure and its 9th-Ct destruction, scattered fragments of Byz occupation and the foundations of several mid-19th Ct buildings. In the summer of 2000 work concentrated on the recovery of the floor levels and the excavation of the robbing trenches of the walls of the R house. A trench was excavated in an attempt to establish where the road onto which the building opened was located. A large extent to the north of the R building was excavated to below the 19th-Ct horizon in preparation for next year's campaign. The R house has now been exposed over an extent of approximately 750 km2 and all indications are that the remains belong to a single large building (Fig. 44). The building is extremely fragmentary, having had the majority of its walls robbed out, but the floors are reasonably well preserved. The rooms towards the W have now been exposed for some time, parts having been excavated by the Greek Archaeological Service and parts exposed in previous seasons of work by the ASCS between 1995 and 1999. The building as exposed has two peristyle courts of which one was tentatively misidentified as a latrine in 1999. Between the two peristyles is a suite of five rooms which may tentatively be identified as more public than private spaces. These include a room with a centrally-placed rectangular fountain pool surrounded by mosaics with geomet- ric motifs, a room with more intricate geometric mosaic pat- terns and a room paved in marble with a centrally-placed</page><page sequence="22">22 DAVID BLACKMAN octagonal fountain. Linkage between these rooms and the courts can be established in some cases by traces of door thresholds, and in others by water supply and drainage pipes which traverse the area. A large room with earthen floors to the N of the suite of five rooms implicitly belongs with them by reason of a water pipe supplying the octagonal fountain which runs partly under the floor of the room and was perhaps laid in doorways originally connecting the spaces. Four large rooms to the N and E of the E court can only be linked with the suite by circumstantial evidence. For instance, the same destruction debris covered the floor of the room to the N of the E court. The floors of the R house were kept exceptionally clean of material culture. Very little contemporary pottery has been found to date except a single half-preserved cooking vessel sealed below the destruction debris in the room N of the E court; this room was that in which two half-life-sized fresco representations of Nike were found in 1996. Significant quan- tities of this fresco program were recovered in 2000, but since cleaning and mending of the material have not yet begun, noth- ing can be said about what this may contribute to our under- standing of 4th-Ct painting. Another exception to the general paucity of finds within the house was the find of nine small- scale sculptures in a corridor to the N of the suite of public rooms. This collection, which will be published by Dr Lea Stirling, has now been fully cleaned and mended. The deities represented are Artemis, Aphrodite, Roma, Europa, Pan, Herakles, Dionysos and Asklepios (twice). Numismatic evidence indicates that the building was destroyed by fire ca 365-375 AD, plausibly the direct result of the earthquake of 365 or that of 375. The walls were robbed out in the 6th Ct to recover blocks with which to construct the bath and long building uncovered and reported in previous seasons. The fill of the robbing trench- es in the W side of the building contained the substantial remains of three EG-MG vessels of types frequently found in graves. Added to a G pin and finger ring found in earlier sea- sons, this material suggests that the stone robbing operation dis- turbed graves of this period underlying the floors of the R house. On the E side of the area the R floor was removed, revealing the remains of two walls meeting at right angles. Although the associated strata have not yet been excavated, the walls appear to belong stylistically to a period earlier than the C period. To the N of the R house an area of about 550m2 was opened up and excavated almost completely to Med strata. The remains of a house 18 x 5.5m were revealed completely. Located just below the surface, the walls had been severely damaged by modem ploughing and no traces of the contem- porary floors were preserved. The house was divided unequal- ly into three small rooms in series. According to local memo- ries of living arrangements in premoder houses, and the building's similarity to one excavated in 1995-96, the S room was a family room with a hearth, the central room was likely to be a storage space and the N room was probably a stable. In the SE comer of the latter was found a rectangular stone-built bin with a white clay floor in which four horseshoes were found. A garden wall abutting the W wall of the house incor- porated the remains of a baking oven. In the oven was a thick deposit of ash containing scores of nails, probably the remains of planks used as fuel. The S side of the garden area was filled with a deep refuse dump containing pottery dating to the 2nd quarter of the 19th Ct. The N part of the area was occupied by outlying Ch burials belonging to the cemetery associated with the Panayia church. Two graves and two piles of reburied bones were excavated. One of the interments was of an indi- vidual buried in a contracted rather than extended position, probably because rigor mortis had set in before the body could be laid out according to custom. Several other graves' cuts were defined but remain to be explored. At least two of these are cut by the W wall of the house and thus date before ca 1830. NE of the long building about one half of a smaller structure was cleared. This building was relatively well preserved with doorway, hearth and floor intact. The entrance porch was paved with a calderimi of cobbles. The floor and walls were coated with a thick layer of white marl clay (asprochoma), as was a low hearth platform against the S wall. The floor of the building was covered by a dense layer of tile debris in which were found two glass bottles and a substantial portion of a mid- 19th Ct plate. Six military buttons, each with the number 2 in relief, were found in a pile against the N wall. In the NW cor- ner were the impressions from the emplacement of two large storage jars. The buildings and walls of this period excavated to date cor- respond to buildings marked on a mid-19th Ct plan of the vil- lage in a locale then known as Kavalla mahalla but now known as Arapo mahalla. The long house plan with rooms construct- ed in series, either as a single or a series of phases, predomi- nates. It is a house form commonly encountered in anc. Corinth until relatively recently. The date of construction of the exca- vated houses almost certainly post-dates the Greek War of Independence, during which the town of Corinth was effec- tively levelled. Their desertion almost certainly was due to the earthquake which struck Corinth at 11am on February 21St 1858 and led directly to the founding of New Corinth for the displaced inhabitants of the region. Large quantities of pottery, coins, glass and metalwork found in pits and dumps during the course of the excavations belong to a period spanning ca 1820 to 1860. A large expanse of the terrace N of the theatre and W of the Asklepieion was surveyed using a resistivity meter in collabo- ration with M. Boyd and I.K. Whitbread of the Fitch Laboratory (BSA). One objective of this work, to find remains of the LR city wall, was not achieved. The data collected require much analysis to sort out patterns created by successive layers of anc. buildings. There are traces, however, of what may reasonably be interpreted as the side walls, spina and sphendone of a cir- cus, first identified but never published by C.K. Williams II from remains of the spina uncovered by the University of Texas Excavations near the gymnasium and reported by Wiseman in Hesperia 38 (1969) 64-106. The excavated remains have been the subject of a recent unpublished study by Dr David Romano. As reconstructed, the circus is oriented E-W with the carceres lying to the E. Its inferred overall size is over 400m long by 70m wide. The identification of this monument adds signifi- cantly to the recorded topography of the R colony. The data for the existence of this circus will be published by M. Boyd, D. Romano, G. Sanders and I. K. Whitbread. About 80% of the mosaics of the N market, originally exca- vated in the 1920s, have now been cleaned and consolidated. A poster on the work to date was presented at the ICCM confer- ence at Arles in September 1999.' Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey. Timothy E. Gregory and Daniel J. Pullen (ASCS) report on the second field season in 2000: 'In 2000 the project focused on the so-called 'Central Corridor' of E Korinthia, from the PR sites of Gonia and Yirisa in the W, to Kromna and Perdikaria in the centre, and Kyra Vrysi and Kenchries on the Saronic Gulf. The project carried out systematic survey over an area of 3.32 km2, representing 38% of the area available for survey in 2000.</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 23 Work this year brought the number of recorded artefacts to approximately 120,000, a reminder that we are working in the hinterland of one of the greatest cities of Greece. In part because of this EKAS seeks to carry out a 'low-impact' archaeological survey, with a minimum of disturbance to the cultural integrity of the area. Thus, the description, drawing and photography of representative artefacts were carried out in situ and in a systematic fashion: at present more than 12,527 items from the 2000 survey have been entered into the electronic database. Among the more notable discoveries of the 2000 season are two areas of religious activity (evidence of monumental archi- tecture, dining, ritual activity) in an area between Kyra Vrysi and Kromna, S of the main Hexamilia-Isthmia road. A further notable area of activity was the large fortress discovered on one of the heights of Mt Oneion (Venista), between Xylokeriza and Kenchries. This provides new information about the extent and nature of the fortifications on Mt Oneion in the LC period, as well as the routes into the mountainous interior of Korinthia in antiquity and the middle ages. Investigation in the areas N of Rachi Boska and around the known sites of Gonia and Yiriza add to our knowledge of PR settlement patterns and generally confirm conclusions that were beginning to appear at the end of the 1999 season. The identification of EH I material at Kromna adds to last year's discovery of EH I at Rakhi Bosca. Evidence now suggests that EH I sites were relatively wide- spread, contrasting with the later EBA and MBA, for which periods we have found fewer sites. The investigation of tombs, under the direction of Joseph Rife, brought to light many new areas of burials, apparently stretching from Myc to LR times, while the study of the archaeology of the mod. period, under Lita Diacopoulos, focused on the villages of Examilia and Xylokeriza.' Isthmia. Prof. Elizabeth Gebhard (ASCS) reports on the University of Chicago excavation 2000 study season: 'Conservation of metals proceeded, and the west water- works were conserved and then filled in. Major progress was made on several volumes for publication in the Isthmia series, as follows: Rachi Settlement: Virginia Anderson-Stojanovic. As the Rachi volume nears completion the deposit lists were finalized and photography of objects completed. Approximately 60 new ceramic fragments were added to the inventory, primarily from the shrine that predated the settlement. Tables were compiled for groups of objects found within the houses, with the aim of showing as far as possible the functions of different rooms and outdoor spaces. Apparently not related to the life of the settle- ment were a significant number of weapons that may have been deposited during a battle with Roman forces in ca 200-198 BC. Jackson and Stojanovic are collaborating on the presentation of a likely scenario of the battle. LA and C Pottery: Martha Risser, assisted by Peter Tessner. Martha Risser continued work on the volume of LA and C ceramics. Examination of the context pottery was completed this season and 516 pieces removed for inventory. Consultation with Karim Arafat solved problems of overlap in objects from the 6th Ct. Material from the Ohio State Excavations was examined for parallels to the sanctuary ceramics. Archaic Pottery: Karim Arafat. The volume nears completion after a sabbatical year in Athens with occasional trips to Isthmia. HL and R Pottery: John Hayes. The volume nears completion. Descriptions for lots and deposits in the Palaimonion area were finalized. Drawings for the plates are nearly finished. Arms and Armour. Alastar Jackson. Extensive groups of material were photographed by Iman Heystek, including greaves and Illyrian and Decorated Cor helmets, and weapons from the West Foundation and the Rachi Settlement. A study of weapons from the Rachi was undertaken for a chapter in the Rachi volume. Palaimonion: James Hanges. Study of excavation records and objects (inventoried and context pottery) clarified the plan and stratigraphy of Palaimonion phases III and V. An entrance to the W precinct of Palaimonion III from the N was identified. Archaic Temple of Poseidon: Frederick Hemans. The vol- ume nears completion. Deposit descriptions including invento- ried objects and context material were finalized and related to the stratigraphy of the site. Detailed plans of all trenches and sections of deposits were made. The chronology of the various phases of both A and C temples was revised. Study of the A construction deposits revealed the extent to which the blocks were finished before being brought to the site. Isthmia Museum: Elizabeth Gebhard and Peggy Sanders. A series of illustrations composed of phase plans, restored draw- ings, computer reconstructions and photographs of objects and excavations in progress was prepared to accompany the muse- um displays as they are now arranged. These have been given to the Ephor Mrs. Elisabeth Spathari, for use in the proposed remodelling of the museum and revision of the exhibit.' Prof. Timothy E. Gregory (ASCS) reports on the Ohio State University excavations 2000 study season: 'The primary goal of the 2000 season was study of material from the R bath in preparation for publication of this important building. Scott Nash (Mercer University) continued his work on the R pottery, which he and Richard DeMaris (Valparaiso University) are supervising. The bulk of that pottery has now been studied and a preliminary catalogue prepared; what remains is the further analysis of the stratigraphic contexts, drawing, and photography. Jayne Reinhard (Carthage College, Wisconsin, and University of Minnesota) continued her study of the decoration of the R bath. She made important breakthroughs in the under- standing of the interior of the building, especially the marble furniture documented by several surviving pieces. There is now considerably greater understanding of the wall decoration as well as some new information about the exterior appearance of the building. Ms Reinhard was assisted by Andrew Reinhard, who carried out an ambitious program of photo- graphic recording, focused mainly on the fragments of the dec- orative program of the bath. In addition, Dana Moore made drawings of some of the anta capitals and other architectural decorative elements from the bath. Fikret Yegul (University of California, Santa Barbara) con- tinued his study of the architecture of the bath. Last year he completed the architectural description of about half of the building and during the 2000 season he was able to complete the rest of this basic work, that will form the core of the ulti- mate publication of the complex. He re-examined several of the hypotheses for the chronology of the building advanced in previous years, and these all seemed supported by the accumu- lation of additional evidence. In addition, he developed his ideas about the religious symbolism and practices associated with the building, especially the cult of the boy-god Palaimon/ Melikertes. Julie Apley (Ohio State University) continued her work on the three-dimensionial reconstruction of the R bath. Jayne Reinhard was able to provide her with important details about the interior of the bath. Examples of the work being done by Ms. Apley can be seen at http://www.cgrg.ohio-state.edu/-japley/ isthmia.html</page><page sequence="24">24 DAVID BLACKMAN Joseph Rife (Corell University) continued his work toward publication of the LR and Byz burials from Isthmia. His work this summer involved further investigation of the stratigraphy of the burials and their finds, important consider- ations for determining their date. He also investigated certain details from the skeletal remains, including post-mortem dete- rioration and the incidence of caries, with interesting and important results. He also continued the photographic docu- mentation of the burials. A major undertaking of the 2000 season was the formula- tion of a long-term plan for the conservation and archiving of the photographic resources of the project, along with plans for digital production of photographs for publication and public display. Daniel Curtis, project director, drew up the complete plan and made considerable progress in archiving photograph- ic negatives from previous seasons. Cooperation continued with the University of Chicago Excavations at Isthmia toward a plan for the conservation and presentation of the site and the possibility of an improvement of the public displays in the Isthmia Museum.' Lechaion. P. Vesissariou conrinued the study of the sculptures in the great basilica of Lechaion. (Ergon 2000, 106) Nemea. Stephen G. Miller (ASCS) reports on the 2000 exca- vation and other work at Nemea by the University of California at Berkeley: 'The summer of 2000 marked the penultimate in the cur- rent five-year program of large-scale excavations at Nemea. The work this year was focused in three areas: at the E end of the temple of Zeus; a test NW of the temple; and the region immediately N and NW of the Hero Shrine of Opheltes. Excavations at the E end of the 4th-Ct BC temple of Zeus were necessary to prepare the ground for the reconstruction of the fallen columns from that temple. This provided an oppor- tunity to learn more about the 250-year-earlier original temple of Zeus which was known to have existed on the same site. Thanks to the work of 2000, we can now identify several blocks of that early temple still in the foundations of the later temple, and the overall dimensions of the early temple can be estimated at 10 x 36m, as contrasted to the 22 x 45m of the later temple. Its long axis had the same orientation as its suc- cessor, but lay farther to the S. It was also discovered that the landscaping fill in front of the later temple consisted of thousands of fragments of blocks of the early temple. Much time and patience will be needed to reconstruct those blocks, but a number of significant observa- tions can already be made thanks to this debris. Firstly, the nearly total absence of roof tiles indicates that this end of the early temple had a triangular pediment and not a hip-roof as was true of the W, or back, end of the building (see Hesperia 49 [1980] 185-7). Secondly, the total absence of any stone or terracotta sculpture indicates that this pediment did not contain statues, either free-standing or in relief. Thirdly, the discovery of many fragments of stone with a layer of plaster on which were painted designs suggests that the pediment was decorated with a painted scene. This may explain the reference by Euripides to '... painted images in the pediment ...' (yparoi,x; (X' £V ai£et) oiot p6oaTp3Xvov Tirous;. Hypsipyle, Fr. 764N). Beneath the landscaping layers of early temple debris, we also uncovered the surface that had formed the paving in front of that early temple. It consisted of a refined and vividly white clay surface that had been deliberately set and which is very similar to the surface of the early stadium discovered in previ- ous years. The use of such clay paving seems to be a character- istic of the sanctuary of Zeus in the early 6th Ct BC. We also dis- covered that thick layers of cement had been used as paving next to the wall of the early temple. This is a major addition to our knowledge of building materials of the period. It has usually been thought that cement was not common to Greek architec- ture. A trench was opened nearly 100m NW of the temple in the hope of finding conclusive evidence of the N end of the early stadium, given the theory presented last year for the location of the S starting line about 180m to the S near the shrine of Opheltes. Such evidence was not forthcoming, perhaps because we miscalculated the total length of the early stadium. But an interesting if enigmatic small P-shaped enclosure of the 4th Ct was discovered. The significance of this structure will have to await further explorations in the area. Certainly, this area was the scene of much activity in the 4th Ct, as is attested by the dozens of coins which were found here, including an extremely high percentage of silver examples, four of which are from the city of Sikyon. It also seems that the violent 5th- Ct destruction of Nemea may be recognized in the many bronze arrowheads discovered here. The area of greatest archaeological activity in 2000 was to the N and NW of the hero shrine of Opheltes. In the latter area, work focused on the complete clearing and investigation of the triple-chambered structure (now known to be a reser- voir) that had been discovered in 1999 at the W terminus of a water supply line. This clearing produced, once again, a large number of lamps of the 3rd Ct AD. These continue to puzzle, for they are found in isolation from any other material of the same period, and isolated at the triple-chambered structure. Further, each lamp is different from every other lamp in the deposit, even though all are mould-made and of types that are known elsewhere (e.g. from Argos, Athens and Corinth). Most of the lamps also appear to have been used only once, if at all, to judge by the slight traces of burning at their nozzles. It is as if someone made a collection of one of each lamp type, and deposited the collection deliberately in the newly discovered structure at Nemea. From the layers surrounding the triple-chambered structure, and giving its date of construction, came dozens of coins from the late 4th Ct BC, and a single-use well nearby also produced pottery of this period. The existence of this well, and of the slightly later water channel, suggests that a dependable supply of water was wanted in this area. Such a suggestion became a certainty with excavation with- in the triple-chambered structure. To our great surprise, the central of the three chambers (the only one that time allowed us to excavate) was constructed of massive, well-cut limestone blocks. The walls created from these blocks defined a space roughly 2 x 3m, and more than 5.50m deep. We did not reach the bottom, although discovery of a number of liquid-holding vessels at this depth confirm what the water channel demands: this structure is a reservoir for very large quantities of water. If the flanking chambers extend to the same depth as the central one, then more than 100m3 of water could be stored here. The next question is clear: what need was there in this part of the sanctuary of Zeus, far from the bath and the hotel and the sacred square and the temple, for so much water? The answer may be horses. We have long sought the hippodrome in this part of Nemea, and it appears that we are now asking questions which have never before been framed, even at Olympia. What facilities were made available for the hundreds of horses that competed at the games? How were they provided with food and water? What happened to the manure that must have accu- mulated in large quantities? We are eager to explore this area further next year to see if, in fact, we have discovered a part of the 'stables' of the 4th-Ct BC hippodrome.</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 25 That the hippodrome was in this area already 250 years ear- lier was also established this year in excavations immediately to the N of the hero shrine. The man-made earth mound of the hero shrine was shown to have continued further to the N than previously believed, and this peninsula-like projection's E slope may have provided a slope for spectators at the early sta- dium. Its W slope was extremely steep, and at its base succes- sive layers of light gravel and sand retain the ruts of chariot wheels. We seem to have discovered the E edge of the racing surface of the hippodrome of the 6th and 5th Cts BC, and we look forward to next year's work when we will be able to uncover more of this surface. The mound of the hero shrine consists, at its core, of a heavy red earth which produced much pottery of the Myc period (13th Ct BC) and some of the G period (8th Ct BC), but we were not able to determine if the latter, later pottery rep- resents a 'remodelling' of a Myc mound, or the actual date of original construction. In either event, the history of the hero shrine as an artificial mound has been extended back signifi- cantly. As in 1997 at the SW and 1998 at the S and the E, so this year we discovered that, on the N, the mound was extensively expanded in the 6th Ct BC. This was done by the importation of 'clean dirt' which was piled up in alternate reddish and whitish layers; each layer produced only a votive vessel asso- ciated with ritual drinking. These layers were then 'surfaced' by a sloping layer of red earth which had rubble embedded in it at various points, apparently to create the illusion of a greater antiquity for this made-to-order hero shrine mound. We thus come to understand that in the 6th Ct, perhaps specifically at 583 BC when the Nemean games are recorded to have begun as a panhellenic festival, an artificial mound was created as the shrine of Opheltes. The early stadium was set along one side of it, and the early hippodrome along the other. The idea that Nemea was deliberately copying the situation that had previously developed at Olympia will be examined further in excavations at Nemea in 2001. Temple reconstruction: the work of re-erecting two columns (in addition to the three that have always stood) of the 4th-Ct temple of Zeus progressed satisfactorily during the past twelve months, although it was delayed during the period of the excavations when the workmen were needed in the trench- es. One column now stands to its full original height and needs only its capital to complete it, while the other is just at the half- way point where a missing block will have to be replaced by a new piece which will necessitate the re-opening of the quarries - a task that will be necessary in any event if the full facade of the temple is to be restored before the 2004 Olympics, as is now hoped. In the meantime, the external surfaces of the new stone (carved to fit, and fastened to, the broken surfaces of the old) are being worked down with the new flutes continuing the line of the old. Several technical studies are also underway with regard to future reconstruction, including further seismic and engineering investigations, and testing and preparation of syn- thetic stone to be used in patching small areas. This work should be finished by the end of this calendar year. Public relations and paedagogic projects: the Second Nemead. Two specific projects should be mentioned in this category of attempts to disseminate our results to the general community. First, we were able to complete a number of con- servation tasks so that the museum displays have now been completed, especially with a number of additions to the ceram- ics of the ECh and Byz periods. We were also able to install in the museum an eight-minute video, in English and Greek, which explains the functioning of the hysplex starting mecha- nism in the ancient stadium. This has become a popular stop- ping point in the museum tours. Secondly, the revival of the Nemea Games was a great suc- cess. The number of participants increased from the First Nemead in 1996 to 762 runners from 45 countries, and there was again a crowd of spectators that exceeded 5,000. The cere- monies began with a welcome from the Chancellor of the University of California, Robert Berdahl, and the lighting of the flame on the altar by the Minister of Culture of Greece, Theodoros Pangalos. Particularly noteworthy was the partici- pation, as runners and as judges, of the Ambassadors to Greece from: Armenia, Australia, Canada, Chile, Columbia, Denmark, India, Lithuania, Morocco, Slovakia, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States of America (the Ambassadors of Poland and Spain were unable to attend at the last minute). Other highlights included the participation of 93-year-old LaGrand Nielsen - the star of the 1996 Games returned to Nemea. In addition to the competitions, a presentation of 'Hypsipyle at Nemea,' a modem adaptation of Euripides' story of the foundation of the Nemean Games, was especially note- worthy. It is clear that the Nemean Games are becoming not only an excellent means of bringing Nemea to the attention of a wide audience, but also a significant contribution to the Olympic movement. The foundations have been laid for the Athens Olympics in 2004 and, at that time, the Third Moder Nemead.' Phlious basin. The third season of intensive archaeological survey in the Phlious basin took place in 2000 under the direc- tion of Doris Ittameier and Joseph Maran (Institut fir Ur- und Friihgeschichte, Heidelberg University), concentrating, as in the two previous years, on the W half of the basin. They report: 'In 2000 it was possible to define 32 sites, covering EH to Byz; in a single season more sites were thus identified than in the previous two years put together. In the SW part of the basin an R site in the fields in the vicinity of Prophitis Ilias Leontiou was systematically investi- gated; it had been partly destroyed by the deep ploughing the year before. S of this, a massive anc. stone foundation, covered by macchia, was discovered; it must have belonged to a public building. A lack of finds does not yet allow a dating of the foundation. A site on a spur of Mt Koukouyeras, which had been known since 1998 and had yielded architectural elements including fragments of Doric capitals in previous years, was systematically surveyed. It seems to be a predominantly R site, but occasional earlier sherds were also found, including one possibly of A date. Entirely surprising was the discovery of a PR site on the summit of Mt Koukouyeras at a height of 65 lm above sea-level, the exact chronology of which has not yet been established. In the N part of the basin, walking the fields E of the vil- lage of Petri revealed a high density of Byz finds as well as remains of Byz buildings which had been partly cut into by deep ploughing. This is possibly the continuation of the Byz settlement remains that can be observed in the centre of the mod. village of Petri. In one location the Byz settlement is superimposed on an EH II site. This is located ca 400m NE of the extensive EH settlement of Petri, which yielded numerous examples of lead sealings in an excavation con- ducted by the 4th Ephorate. Walking a hill W of the large rema of Petri revealed MH and Myc findspots, which extended over several sections of the hill. In the vicinity of Aidonia, in the NW of the basin, it was possible to define more clearly the extent of a MH and possibly also EH settle- ment area on the slope above the Myc chamber tombs, which had already been discovered in 1999. Moreover, traces of</page><page sequence="26">26 DAVID BLACKMAN 45. Argos, agora: Roman hearth site settlement activities of the C period and of late antiquity (?) were noticed here. On the hill opposite is located the acropolis of Aidonia, which dates from the shaft-grave and Myc period and probably belongs with the chamber tombs; it, too, had already been discovered in 1999. The geoarchaeological examinations conducted by Andreas Lang (Geographisches Institut, Bonn University) and Markus Fuchs (Forschungsstelle Archaometrie der Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften) were aimed at the three-dimensional documentation of the sedimentary structure of the basin through drilling and geophysical prospection. The basin of Phlious presents itself as a sedimentary basin with a highly heterogeneous structure caused by tectonic disturbances and anthropogenic influence. At the N and S edge of the basin, colluvia of ca 5m thickness resulting from soil erosion were detected. The chronological framework of the sedimentation of these colluvia, and also of the massive alluvia in the basin's centre, is now to be established with the help of 'Optically Stimulated Luminescence' (OSL) and C14 dating.' ARGOLIS Argos. Agora. Marcel Pierart (French School) directed work in 2000 in the area of building D. They were not able to clear the area completely because of the collapse over it of the Nannopoulos house, but they did dig a trench 4 x 4 m in AW.AX 87 and confirmed the existence of a gutter cut in blocks of poros which had already been found W of the build- ing and in the area of the drains (E). This gutter ran parallel to the race-course of the Early Imperial period but a little to the N. It was thought to have acted as a boundary of an earlier phase of the dromos (see AR 1999-2000, 32). They also worked in the area of the drains, cleaning the triangular basin (BA.BC 92.93) with a view to presentation of the site to visitors. Anne Pariente directed a team from the French School on the Karmoyannis site which covers part of the agora. In 2000 numerous baulks and comers of baulks left by previous exca- vation were removed in the N and W, with a view to clarifying stratigraphy and remains (see AR 1999-2000, 33 and Fig. 44). To the N in the interior of the R building they removed the W baulk of AL-AM 74 and revealed that the hearth unearthed in 1999 was set in a basin lined with a sort of lime (Fig. 45) with 3rcL4th Ct AD sherds. Underneath was a layer of compact cindery reddish-brown earth, confirming that the hearth proba- bly belonged to a workshop area, as suggested in 1999. At the point at which the large masonry drain crosses the S wall of the building, the wall and the bend in the drain had been removed when a mod. septic tank was built. In the SW part of AN 74 was revealed a new section of covering for the drain (square terracotta tiles in a ridged formation). The team cleaned out the bottom of the drain, removing a layer contain- ing sherds of the 3rL2nd Cts BC and 2nd3rd Cts AD. In the S part of AN 74 three badly-preserved skeletons were found. The pit for one of these had partly destroyed the drain cover (Fig. 46). These form part of the vast necropolis of late but uncertain date which extended over the whole agora. The other pit containing two skeletons had been cut through the remains of a beaten earth floor covered with a layer of dried mud. The remains of a similar floor had been discovered in 1988 in AM 76 (BCH 113 [1989], 708-10): they belong to a late settlement area in the NW of the site. Three other burials were revealed in the N baulk of AP 74, producing iron nails, fragments of glass and a pale green glazed sherd of the Byz period. Under these a cobble floor was reached which had already been found in this sector S of the NE krepis (cf. BCH 114 [1990], 852 and fig. 1). In the area of the NE krepis, under a level producing mixed sherds (HL to Early Empire), in the S part of AN 74 and W baulk of AN 75 was found a thick pocket of stone chips, prob- ably part of the robber trench for blocks for the krepis (cf. BCH 113 [1989], 708 and figs. 8-9). Here too the first course of the krepis is preserved (Fig. 47). At the junction of the krepis with the curved exedra (cor- ner of W baulk of AN 76/N baulk of AO 76) was excavated a layer of beige-grey earth with fragments of carbonized wood and sherds of the st-2nd Cts AD. Within the exedra (comer of N baulk of AN 77/W baulk of AM 78) the fill produced fragmentary sherds and animal bones. Clearing the fill put in against the krepis at the time of the deeper digging out of the interior of the structure produced a Pergamene lamp handle and a few square centimetres of a coat of red plaster on hydraulic mortar preserved in situ. In the S part of the site in the area of the apsidal building, the following stratigraphical sequence was worked out: a con- creted gravel floor in AR 76 rested on a layer of brown earth producing sherds with heavy concentration of the 3rd-4th Cts AD (AR 76, AS 77) on top of a very compact floor about 20cms thick composed of large pebbles, broken stone and tile frag- ments in a bedding of greyish mortar. It is assumed that this was a road which crossed the agora, probably in ruins by then, at a late period from SE to NW (AR 76, AS 76, AS77) (Fig. 48). Under the road was a layer of fine dark-brown earth rest- ing on more friable earth of a paler colour packed with frag- mentary sherds; both levels produced household wares of the Late Empire/ECh period (Late Ware, combed and ribbed pottery). 46.

Argos, agora: NE krepis 48. Argos, agora: road Thereafter the stratigraphy differentiates: in AR 76 there was a thick level of debris (corresponding with the destruc- tion of the N wall of the apsidal room). This covered a very compact (destruction?) level with fragments of stones and tiles embedded in a mortar like that of the floor of the vestibule of the apsidal building. The latter was unearthed in AS 76: it consisted of rubble and pebbles and was perfectly preserved (Fig. 49). In AS 77, to the W of the second step of the entrance to the vestibule, a layer of friable brown earth of the 4th Ct AD rest- ed on a floor of fine gravel and fragments of tile. It seemed to have been cut by two successive levels rich in material of a late date. Excavation stopped at the bottom of the first course of the facade of the vestibule, as a new layer appeared. Embedded in the concrete of the late road and penetrating into this layer, a column of limestone was found with a pol- ished shaft 0.70m high. On its side, strangely smoothed, it bore an inscription: a dedication to Pan of the HL period (Fig. 50), with 15 lines preserved (13 of these are names in the nomina- tive). Its top was broken away and a notch in its upper part proves its reuse. It is now in the Argos Museum. The stratigraphy is quite different in the area of the N wall of the apse in AR 75. The late road did not cross this area. A layer of grey-brown quite friable earth rested on a paler layer mixed with small stones and fine gravel. MH settlement on the Aspis. A. Philippa-Touchais and G. Touchais carried out a study season in the Argos Museum on the pottery from the Aspis, concentrating on the matt-painted pot- tery. They confirmed that the first settlement phase (level 4b) was late MH II, with scarcely any architectural remains, fol- lowed by an MH IIIA phase (level 4a) associated with the apsi- dal building, and a last phase, MH IIIB (levels 2 and 3), asso- ciated with the elongated building. The richness of the ceramic production starting with the very first phase indicates a relatively advanced level of tech- nological development and the fact that this was sustained up to the last phase suggests that this was not a phase of decline. Imported pottery types (with gold mica) and Minoan imi- tations are most common in the earlier phases and almost non-</page><page sequence="28">28 DAVID BLACKMAN existent in the last phase, when the production has an increas- ingly local character. For example, there are a great number of stemmed cups of Helladic type with a variety of decoration unparalleled in contemporary sites. This indicates a local workshop attached to the mainland tradition and suggests that Argos was increasingly marginalized at a time when other cen- tres, like Mycenae, were developing in close contact with more or less distant countries like Crete and Egypt. The first results of neutron activation analyses done by the Demokritos Centre (V. Kylikoglou) show that the glazed paint- ed pottery forms a separate group of homogeneous chemical composition, that the Minyan pottery is heterogeneous despite its apparent homogeneity and that there is no fundamental dif- ference between matt-painted pottery and monochrome or coarse pottery. Further (petrographic) analysis by the Fitch lab- oratory will enable us to refine this analysis. The results will be presented in an article in BCH (124/2 or 125). M.-F. Billot (French School) studied architectural terracot- tas in Argos Museum from the 1987, 1999 and 2000 excava- tions and revised the records of pieces discovered in 1990-1991 in a well. Epidauros. M-F. Billot (French School) studied the decorated architectural terracottas from the excavation of the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas (1998-99) and from the sanctuary of Asklepios and a few decorated pieces excavated by Ch. Kritzas in the Abaton. At the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas, Prof. V. Lambrinoudakis continued in 2000 the reconstitution of the great altar of Apollo and the study for the restoration of the HL terrace of the sanctuary. A ruined HL peribolos wall was dis- covered, surrounding the slopes of the sanctuary, as well as remains of a PR settlement, but nothing connected with the use of the sanctuary. The PR remains surrounded by the peribolos wall belong to the EH II and Myc periods (Fig. 51). The struc- tures are rectangular and apsidal. Near one of these EH II hous- es were three tombs (52, 54-55) of the same period. The graves were pits, covered with large unworked stones. The dead were placed in a contracted position on their side, and only one con- tained grave-goods: a spindle-whorl, an obsidian flake and a stone tool. (Ergon 2000, 52-54) Halieis. James A. Dengate (ASCS) provides a status report on the publication of the excavations at anc. Halieis: 'In January 2000, Christina Dengate, Halieis publications coordinating editor, obtained a grant from the Schrader Committee at Indiana University to fund the publication of the first four volumes of the Halieis excavations, initially for the year 2000 with funding for 2001-2 contingent upon comple- tion of each prior year's programme.

Ault has also published "Living in the Classical Polis: The Greek House as Microcosm," Classical World 93 (2000), 483-96, that deals with Halieis material; he did research in the Halieis storeroom at Porto Cheli in summer 2000.' Lerna. Martha H. Wiencke (ASCS) reports on progress with the Lema Publication Project: 'In the spring of 2000 Elizabeth C. Banks continued work on publication of Lera IV (architecture and stratification) with a view to publication by the end of 2001, and plans to gather material from the Lera archive for the volume on Lera I and II. Curtis Runnels and Britt E. Hartenberger finished work on the lithics in Argos in 1998; the excellent final report, "The Bronze Age Flaked Stone Industries from Lera", has been submitted to Hesperia and will probably appear next year. K.D. Vitelli plans to finish work on Neolithic Lera this year. Carol Zerer hopes to finish the editing of the entire text on MH Lera this year and has also been working with Drs Richard Jones and Ian Whitbread (BSA) on the ceramic wares of Lema V, probably for publication in Hesperia.

The area N and W of the build- ing complex, which has been uncovered by the W gate along the fortification wall, was investigated. New rooms were found, showing that the complex consists of two wings separated by a central corri- dor. The finds from the new rooms include abun- dant painted, plain and coarse pottery of LH IIIB2, two crushed lead vessels, stone tools, pieces of ochre, fluorite and mother-of-pearl, as well as fragments of painted plaster. On an extensive plateau on the SW slope of the acropolis architectural remains with signs of a great catastrophe were excavated, including part of 53. Midea a room and some walls in bad condition (Fig. 52). marine st) Floors associated with the walls were not found. Bedrock was uncovered in all trenches and in a large area it had been roughly worked to form an uneven surface, most probably of a road. A great amount of LH IIIB2 pottery was found, dating the catastrophe around the end of the 13th Ct BC, when a devastating earth- quake struck Midea. Other finds include a complete stone mor- tar, pounders, whetstones and millstones, fragments of lead vessels, two bronze arrow heads, glass beads, pieces of ochre, fluorite and mother-of-pearl, plaster fragments and clay human and animal figurines. Large quantities of food remains were also found, such as animal bones, shells, figs and olive pips. Under the architectural remains ofLH IIIB2 an earlier con- struction phase was identified, dating to the 15th Ct BC accord- ing to the pottery found. Noteworthy is a LM IB/LH IIA vase fragment with marine style decoration; it comes from a large stirrup jar decorated with an octopus, rock work and sea-weed (Fig. 53). In the same area a badly damaged cist grave with a child burial was found, dating to the shaft grave period. The grave goods include a yellow Minyan rim-handled small jar (Fig. 54), two mushroom-shaped ivory knobs, probably coming from a wooden box, now lost, a bead of cornelian and a piece of orpiment, an arsenic mineral with bright yellow colour, which was used as raw material for pigment making. Orpiment was found on the shipwreck at Ulu Burun near Kas. From the area around the grave many sherds of MH III-LH I were recovered.' Dr Schallin reports on work in the Swedish sector in 2000: 'Two trenches were opened in the E part of the citadel area: trenches 1 and 2. Trench 1 is situated on one of the middle ter- races on the E slope. The aim of the excavations was to inves- tigate the presence of any ancient remains. A 4 x 4m square was opened and immediately extended towards the W by a 2 x 2.5m area. In the W extension bedrock was immediately reached 0.10-0.15m below surface level, and showed no signs of having been worked. The rest of the trench was excavated down to ca im and a small area of 2 x 1.5m down to ca 2m. It was concluded that the debris found, containing soil mixed with stones, pottery sherds, bones and shells, had fallen from above - the poor quality of the pottery sherds and the stones indicated this. Undisturbed levels may well be found beneath the fallen debris, so continued excavation in this trench is desirable. The pottery sherds date from MN to Byz, with the bulk belonging to the LH period. Trench 2 was situated on top of the citadel wall, ca 25m E of the E gate, with the aim of exposing the top surface of the wall; in extent it was 4m along the wall, and 6.05m in the W and 6.40m in the E across the wall. The mixed soil contained pottery sherds from MN to Med, as well as bones and shells. The excavation was terminated when most of the stones of the wall were exposed at a depth of 0.20-0.30m.' a: vase fragment with yle decoration 54. Midea: rim-handled jar Mycenae: Excavations by the Archaeological Society at Mycenae began under Kyriakos Pittakis in 1840 and have con- tinued, with some breaks, until today. Spyros Iakovides, the last excavator here, has for years been preparing the publica- tion of his research and that of his predecessors. While com- pleting the old investigations and checking the results, he decided to finish the excavation of a Myc house that had pre- viously been excavated in 1950 by I. Papademetriou and Ph. Petsas. During the continuation of the excavation directed by Iakovides and supervised by K. Shelton-Demopoulou, the excavated remains of the house were rediscovered, and the old conclusions were reconfirmed (Fig. 55). The large number of vases - as many as 500 in one area - recorded in the old exca- vations, indicated that the house was used for storage. The building, which was in full use in late LH IIIA2, was at that time destroyed by fire, and the area was abandoned. The new excavation revealed a series of rectangular rooms and corridors belonging to the ground-floor of the complex, whilst the old 55.

(Ergon 2000, 48-51) Nauplion. Dr Berit Wells (Swedish Institute) reports on work in the Nauplion Museum in 2000: 'At present five store-rooms in Nauplion Museum contain material from the Swedish excavations carried out at Asine, Dendra/Midea and Berbati. All rooms have been thoroughly cleaned and organized in order that any published item can eas- ily be located according to bay, shelf and box in each room. All published extant material (much was lost during the last war) stored at Nauplion and in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens has been entered into a database. Also included are the vessels from chamber tomb I.1 at Asine, which were exchanged for Swedish prehistoric material in the 1930s and are now in the Museum of Near Eastern and Mediterranean Antiquities in Stockholm. An abbreviated version of the total inventory will be available in connection with our homepage shortly.' Salanti Didymon. The submerged EH settlement was sur- veyed by the EMA in 1998 (Epyov YIO 7 2, 151) Tiryns. The rescue excavation in the NE part of the city of Tiryns (quadrants LXVIII-LXIX 28-31), begun in 1999, was continued and brought to a close in 2000 under the direction of Joseph Maran (Institut fir Ur- und Friihgeschichte, Heidelberg University) for the German Archaeological Institute in collab- oration with Dr Alkestis Papadimitriou (4th Ephorate). Joseph Maran reports: 'Well-preserved LH IIIC remains of houses came to light in the S sectors of the excavation. In all, remains of five Myc settlement phases could be distinguished, ranging from early LH IIIC to advanced LH IIIC (Fig. 57). The buildings of the earliest phase were erected in the early 12th Ct BC on river sediments; in the second settlement phase, at the latest, an architectural arrangement is encountered in which houses are grouped around a courtyard. This building scheme was essen- tially retained until the final detectable settlement phase; however, the relationship between the courtyard areas and the house structures was subject to marked changes over the course of time. The archaeological findings are closely remi- niscent of those observed in 1976 by K. Kilian in Tiryns town NW - even the orientation and arrangement of the Myc build- ings correspond in the two excavation sectors ca 130m apart. The building remains of the second settlement phase in Tiryns town NE are remarkable for some conspicuous char- acteristics. Attested in this phase only is a masonry technique characterized by the use of very large single blocks of stone in the foundation courses of walls, as well as a building with a large room divided by parallel rows of pillars on stone 57. Tiryns: Mycenaean houses bases. This room was not rebuilt after it had been destroyed by fire, and after the third settlement phase there are no indi- cations of an architectural structure which, by the building standards of the Postpalatial period, could be considered as outstanding. As a consequence of the destruction by fire, the room with the parallel rows of pillars and its immediate vicinity yielded many vessels and other objects in situ, among them fragments of a wall-bracket. This is one of the few such objects (presumably of Cypriot origin) found in Tiryns in a clearly Postpalatial con- text, thus serving as evidence for the continuing 'international' relations of this harbour town following the fall of the palace. The wide-ranging contacts of the inhabitants of Tiryns in the Postpalatial period are illustrated by further finds from settle- ment phases 3 to 5, namely an amber bead, the fragment of a small ivory plaque consisting of several pieces, as well as a bronze scale from a scale armour of Egyptian or Near Eastern type. The investigation of the A cult bothros discovered in 1999 was continued. This revealed that the shaft reached down deep into Myc layers, and it seems that it was originally used as a well. A cultic use is suggested only in connection with the thick layers of stones and architectural terracotta objects, which were packed into the upper part of the shaft as filling. The frag- ments of rider figurines and miniature vessels found between the stones supplement the body of terracotta finds of the previ- ous year and confirm the impression that female representa- tions do not form part of the spectrum of terracotta figurines from this bothros. Whereas the post-Myc levels in the S sectors have been lost through erosion, a section of a LG pottery district was uncovered in the NE sector (Fig. 58). Remains of kilns, along with walking areas and paved paths, and misfired remains of large painted open and closed vessels were found here. The kilns belong to two different types: one with a large, round to oval firing chamber, the walls of which were built of vertical- ly-placed mud-bricks, bricks or even tiles; and the other a kind of 'double kiln' of small dimensions, with two adjoining cham- bers, each with a separate opening for firing, and walls of mud that had been built up against the sides of a pit. The use of</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 31 58. Tiryns: NE sector, pottery district bricks and terracotta tiles in an unmistakably LG context sheds new light on the question of the development of building mate- rials in the 1st millennium BC in Greece. If around 700 BC such materials were in use even at a relatively provincial site such as Tiryns, familiarity with the new building materials must already have been widespread in S Greece. Restoration/conservation: in 2000, J.-M. Klessing for the German Archaeological Institute directed the conservation and restoration of the W stairs and the W gate of the lower citadel, which were executed by the Greek Archaeological Service. Furthermore, he began to execute conservation measures on the uncovered BA settlement remains in the lower citadel.' ARKADIA Asea. Dr Jeanette Fors6n (Swedish Institute) reports on the 2000 season: 'Archaeological activity in Asea continued in 2000 with a final study season on the finds from the Agios Elias excavation carried out in 1997. The study of the Asea Valley Survey finds was completed in 1999 and the final publication of the Survey project will appear in 2002. Concurrently with the final study season of the Agios Elias excavation, a cleaning operation was conducted on the remain- ing city walls and Holmberg's old excavation trenches on top of Asea Paleokastro. It soon became clear that virtually noth- ing remains of Holmberg's old trenches. All the 'Hellenistic houses' excavated by him have been covered by soil and the deep PR trenches have been badly destroyed by activities dur- ing World War II, when a couple of huts and a machine gun nest were built next to and within the deep trenches. Because of the poor state of preservation of Holmberg's trenches, the cleaning work was concentrated on the remaining city walls. The two stumps remaining of the HL spur walls encircling the lower city were cleaned, whereby a new small sally port next to a square tower on the NE spur wall was detected. Two square towers of the wall encircling the acropo- lis, as well as the main entrance to the acropolis on the NE side of the hill were also cleaned. It is evident that the acropolis walls are built in a different way from the HL spur walls and that they most likely are older, possibly of C date. Next to one of the square towers, on the NW side of the acropolis, we believe we have found remains of yet another small, previous- ly unknown, sally port. Dr L. Karlssson documented the cleaned parts of the walls and will prepare a thorough study on their date and building techniques. An experiment with a georadar revealed that enough of the lower city walls probably remains under recent alluvium further down in the lower city to permit intensive geo- radar documentation which might provide information about the full stretch of the lower city walls, and thereby also about the exact area of the polis Asea that was encircled by the wall.' Lousoi: Veronika Mitsopoulos-Leon reports on the work of the Austrian Institute in 2000: 'In several trenches the N foundation of the E building was observed, thus bringing the work on this building to a con- clusion. The foundation is very poorly preserved, with only the lowest course remaining, and this has partly slipped downhill towards the N (Fig. 59: from the SE). The irregular fieldstones are bonded with a green clay packing. The foundation is cov- ered by a layer of earth densely packed with stones. As it con- tains small architectural fragments of the HL temple of Artemis, this has to be interpreted as debris from the old exca- vation. A number of human bones originate from the digging away of Ch graves in the area of the temple. The location of the NE and NW comers of the building was established precisely this year, and it was thus determined that the building was rectangular, 16.20m long and 7.50m wide. Once work on the 'E building' had been completed, its foundations were filled in and the comers marked with blocks of stone. After completing the work on the 'E building', and thus on the sanctuary, and having investigated the residential area, attention is now focusing on the official or administrative cen- tre of the city. Already in 1999 (AR 1999-2000, 38) surveying work had been conducted in the region of the hall at the W end of the city, which was followed up this year by clearing of the four corers and the S section of the W wall. A well-preserved foundation was revealed, consisting of large, carefully-placed limestone boulders. The pry-holes on the finished upper sur- face give indications regarding the missing upper part of the walls. So far, three comers have been defined. In the SW cor- ner three blocks of the upper wall are preserved, among them an orthostat. The hall has an outer length of 65.20m and outer width of 12.05m. In the cleared part of the W wall an extension jutting out towards the W is visible, which on the basis of evi- dence available so far must be considered not to belong to the original state of the building.' 59.

In the context of the restoration programme for the anc. theatre, and after detailed planning of the existing remains, excavations were conducted in the area of the paro- doi, in order to define their precise architectural form and the foundations of the retaining walls, which were in danger of collapsing from the very day of their discovery, 100 years ago. During the cleaning of the upper surface of the W wall of the skenotheke, part of an inscribed sealing was discovered, of the 3rd_2nd Cts BC. The W retaining wall (Fig. 60) was a substan- tial limestone isodomic construction, preserved for a length of 25.50m, in a better condition than its E counterpart (thickness: 1.24-1.28m). It seems that the wall was provided with trans- verse buttresses, at regular intervals, and can be dated to the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 147-50) Tegea. The Norwegian Arcadia Survey carried out its third field season. The director, Dr Knut 0degard (University of Oslo), provided the following report: 'The Norwegian commitment to the archaeology of Arcadia was initated by the excavations in the sanctuary of Athena Alea at Tegea (1990-94) under the direction of the for- mer Director of the Norwegian Institute at Athens, Dr Erik 0stby. In 1998 a new survey project was initiated, The Norwegian Arcadia Survey, whose main aim is to place the sanctuary in a wider, regional context and to investigate the dynamics of landscape change in this part of Arcadia. The proj- ect is interdisciplinary in character, with archaeology, botany and geology as the main components. A preliminary short field season was carried out in 1998, followed by more comprehen- sive fieldwork in 1999 and 2000. A final field season is planned for summer 2001. The archaeological survey has so far partic- ularly focused on the central part of the anc. territory of Tegea, including the ancient urban site itself. Earlier investigations traced the hypothetical line of the city walls, of which no remains are visible on the surface, and thus the extent of the ancient city (V. B6rard, 'Tegee et la Tegeatide', BCH 17 [1893], 529-49). In these studies, the walls form an elliptical shape, strikingly similar to the better- documented situation at Mantineia farther north. The agora of the city has long been recognized in an area around the still standing remains of the HL theatre. But a thorough documen- tation and analysis of surface finds had not been undertaken before the survey in 1999 and 2000. Our distribution maps show a marked drop in archaeologi- cal material on the surface more or less on the hypothetical line of the walls, and thus confirm the earlier studies, with one important exception. In the S half of the city, only a very low frequency of finds was recorded. This may partly be explained by recent sedimentation. Georadar sections and core- drilling suggest that significant changes in the landscape have occurred since antiquity. Some shallow ponds may even have existed in this area when the first archaeological investigations of the sanctuary of Athena Alea took place towards the £-. D-.-: R end of the 19th Ct. Only about 40m N of the tem- Y -- pple of Athena Alea, we have documented a 30m- .... wide ditch running in an E-W direction, which once must have formed a natural border of the X sanctuary. Preliminary dating of pottery fragments from core samples suggests that this ditch, which was probably waterlogged for most of the year, gradually silted up after the R and Byz period. It is therefore a reasonable hypothesis that the inhab- ited area of the city of Tegea never extended as far S as the sanctuary of Athena Alea. The city walls may, however, have exploited the natural defences of this marshy landscape. In view of these new finds, it is highly like- ly that the sanctuary of Athena Alea was situated outside the walls, which probably are located about 100m N of the temple. Other important finds have also been made in the city area. In the vicinity of the present-day village of Episkopi, about 600m W of the agora, building blocks and georadar sections suggest the location of a previously unknown temple. To judge from the georadar sections, the foundations of this new struc- ture are probably ca 16 x 26m. Apart from this structure, which we so far cannot date accurately, the finding of a Doric capital of the latter half of the 6th Ct ca 150m N of the agora definite- ly documents monumental buildings of the A period in the city. About 200m W of the agora, a dense concentration of mis- fired pottery and stacking rings shows the existence of pottery workshops, probably active from the 5th Ct onwards. The ear- liest material in any quantity from the city seems to date from the latter half of the 6th Ct, but with all due caution at this pre- liminary stage, the material dating to the LC and HL periods seems to be far more abundant. Also artefacts from the R and later periods are present in some quantity, but only further study can provide statistical evidence on the historical devel- opment of the city of Tegea. The survey has also covered large areas to the N and NW of the anc. city, comprising the hills of Akra and Hagios Sostis, two of the candidates for the location of the akropolis of Tegea, mentioned by Pausanias. NW of Hagios Sostis, the remains of a votive deposit were found, comprising terracottas and painted pottery, probably connected with a previously known sanctuary in this area. No important new finds were made on or near the hilltops of Hagios Sostis and Akra, but two large sites, with material mainly from the LR period, were dis- covered at some distance from the hilltops. One of them is sit- uated N of Akra on a low hill overlooking the plain towards the N and Mantineia, the other W of Hagios Sostis, located along a probable anc. road towards the N. The botanical, or palynological, survey, directed by Knut Krzywinski of the University of Bergen, has as its main focus changes in the vegetation and landscape. The main tool is pollen analysis of soil samples from core-augering. The analy- sis is still at a very preliminary stage, but it should be empha- sized that the results so far are very promising and the plain of Tegea may very well be one of the first areas in Greece to pos- sess regional pollen-charts. So far, samples have been taken from more than 15 localities, pollen content has been estab-</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 33 lished and a reference core from the wetlands around Lake Takka, SW of Tegea, has been collected. A large number of dif- ferent pollen species have been identified, stretching from grasses usually associated with grain production, to linen man- ufacture and cannabis cultivation.'

Joost Crouwel and Mieke Prent (Netherlands Institute) report on the work of the University of Amsterdam at the acropolis of Geraki: 'The 2000 excavation followed two seasons of intensive survey (1995 and 1996), one of trial excavations (1997), a study season (1998) and a season of large-scale excavation (1999). Preliminary reports can be found in Pharos 3-7 (1995-1999). The 2000 campaign yielded new evidence for occupation during the FN, EH II, MH and C-HL periods. Whereas finds from earlier seasons also include PG through A artefacts, Myc continues to be absent. Repairs of the acropolis wall that involve the use of tile and mortar indicate LR or Med occupa- tion, but so far no tangible (and therefore more closely datable) evidence for these periods has been identified in excavation. The best-preserved architectural remains date to the EH II and C-HL periods. To the former period belong what at present evidence seems to be the earliest acropolis wall of Geraki. In area II of the excavation almost 7m of a megalithic exterior wall have now been traced (Fig. 61). At places two courses are preserved of a wall composed of boulders which measure up to ca 1.25 x "~~~~--'*~ *·~ ~exterior face of extant acropdis wai I ~ ~ __ 1.50 x 1.60m. The interior wall, separated from the exterior one by an area ca im wide filled with stones and gravel, is of a more modest masonry using roughly-hewn blocks. In the SE of the excavated area, a N-S running wall, 0.80m wide, was found, which joins the EH II acropolis wall in the N; burnt EH II destruction material had accumulated against its W face. In the SW of the excavated area, part of a probable storage room was found. This yielded fragments of fine EH II vessels (with parallels at Lera IIIC), two-three pithoi in 'Geraki ware', as well as three fragments of the clay band which may have helped to seal the mouth of these vessels; one of them retained the impression of a lentoid seal. This is the second EH II stor- age room with sealing fragments found in Geraki, the first one having been found in 1997 in area I of our excavation (see Pharos V, 1997 and AR 1997-98, 35-36). The storage room in area II, however, is set over the rubble fill between the exteri- or and interior walls and therefore seems to be an example of a casemate. New architectural remains of C-HL date were identified in both areas I and II. In area I we identified a seventh room of the C-HL building excavated during previous seasons. This structure may have had at least three building phases. Of spe- cial interest is the mounting evidence for metalworking (espe- cially iron) in one of these C-HL rooms. Another room yield- ed a finely chiselled limestone ball (di. ca 0.21m; weight 19kg: Fig. 62); it is tempting to suppose that this projectile had actu- ally been launched into the building, causing the roof to col- lapse. Alternatively, it was kept in this room for defensive pur- poses in a potential siege. A bronze coin of Ptolemaios III (246-221 BC) was found just below the floor surface on which this ball rested. In area II the full extent of a first, and part of a second room of C-HL date were exposed. The first room had two doorways, one of them with a sandstone pivot-hole. The other was blocked during the C-HL period of use. Two major earth floors were identified, each with a number of possible relayings and producing similar artefacts: a fair quantity of terracotta loomwieghts and some small metal objects, such as a bronze handle and vase attachment. An interesting feature of this room is a medium-fine jug with fugitive black glaze, firmly embedded in the lowest floor. The bottom of the jug seems to have been deliber- ately pierced and some burnt matter was found -- inside, covered by a piece of tile. This suggests ritual use.' AREA 11 61.

At the Varikorrema site the remains of a building of R date were identified, with traces of a mosaic floor. (ADelt 150) Gytheio. Ageranos. Remains of R walls were found in 1.5m depth by the EMA; the most impressive was 2.40m wide and traced for 20m. (Epyov YnnO 3, 166) At the Valtaki site were found extensive LR architectural remains (walls, cisterns) which are associated with the antiqui- ties reported by the BSA at the beginning of the 20th century along the coast (BSA 13 [1906-7], 229-30; for the underwater remains see N.C. Flemming and others in D.J. Blackman [ed.], Marine Archaeology [1973], 13). Part of a retaining wall, cist- tombs and a horseshoe-shaped construction, the latter containing a large number of bones and pottery of HL date, were excavated on the road from Gytheion to Sparta. Parts of walls were record- ed at the junction of Odos Ger. Kapsale and Vas. Georgiou B', in Odos Erakleous, and at the junction of Odos Erakleous and Ger. Kapsale. In the wider area of the mod. town the remains of the R aqueduct were located: originally identified in the 19th Ct AD, it started at the site of Tzonakes, on the bank of the river Bardounia, and ran for a length of 16km to a substantial cistern, now known as Kamares tou Andreakou.

Off Cape Xyli, near Plytra, a wreck of the R period was found by the EMA, with a cargo of amphoras and iron anchors. (Epyov YHnO 3, 166) Sparta. In 1995 19 rescue excavations were carried out in the mod. town, the majority involving architectural, mostly domestic remains of the HL and especially of the R period. Of the earlier periods there were scanty remains. Fragmentary architectural remains, as well as three apothetes of the LC/HL period, were excavated at the junction of Odos IX Merarchias and V. Epeirou, while parts of buildings, including a drain, with three architectural phases, as well as a tomb and two apothetes containing pottery and idols, were located in Odos Ananiou; the architectural remains belonged to the EHL period. Finally, more isolated walls of the HL peri- od were recorded in the area of the Techniko Lykeio Spartes. The excavation of the well-preserved private R bath com- plex, at the junction of Odos Dioskouron and a street without name, which had begun in 1994 (AR 1999-2000, 42), was completed this year, with the detailed investigation of the dif- ferent rooms (Fig. 63: general view from the S). It seems that the building (13.50 x 6.50m), which lay on an E-W axis, con- sisted of an agglomeration of rectangular or square rooms, heated both by the hypocaust system (suspensurae) for the floors and walls, and by the tegulae mammatae system for the walls. It was erected in the last decades of the 1st Ct BC (C. Julius Eurycles) in the context of a general architectural re- organization of the town, and it is the earliest specimen of this type of building so far known in Sparta (plan : Fig. 64). The complex went through two building phases; the second phase, dated in the 4th5th Cts AD, involved modifications of the orig- inal plan (abandonment of cistern 8 and of the niche in room 2, change of use of room 4, construction of built drain 4). The original plan comprised six rooms, a caldarium (room 1) with its own hypocaust (small piers made of clay discs, in two tiers), and three openings leading into what was probably the tepidar- ium (2), a square room with a partly-preserved hypocaust and a niche with a hole in the floor, for the outflow of the water; along the N wall of the room was discovered a low rectangular cistern (1.75 x 70cm), with its own hypocaust. To the W of room 2 lay the frigidarium (3), a smaller room, also with a hypocaust, preserving piers intact below floor level, and to its W, room 4, with a circular furnace in the centre (di. 1.32m, h. 80cm), built of mud-brick and provided with a stone slab floor; the room also had a separate praefumium (5), which opened on</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 35 64. Sparta: Roman bath complex, plan the W. The best-preserved room (6), lay on the S side, and con- sisted of a small private pool (1.67 x 1.06m) with its own hypocaust and praefumrnium; this was the only room in the complex which preserved part of its original floor surface, ca 79cm above the base of the hypocaust piers. The pool, which communicated with room 2 through an opening in its NE cor- ner, had a marble slab floor and marble orthostats; in the mid- dle of its S wall, a lead pipe channelled the water away in a stone-built drain. A dense network of drains surrounded the building on the N, W and S sides. Among the other remains of the R period the remains of two building complexes were unearthed in Odos ton 118, on either side of an anc. road which preserved five successive road surfaces, and three terracotta drains, on the same axis (E-W). To the N of the road was found part of a LR building (4th Ct AD), with two rooms, both of which communicated with a third area to the N, through symmetrically-placed door- ways. In the centre of the E room was found the upper surface of a brick column, probably associated with an earlier con- struction phase of the building; it was coated with plaster, imi- tating the flutings of a stone column, and preserved traces of red colour. In the E part of the same room was discovered the upper part of a pottery kiln, lined internally with clay. The S wall of the W room was coated with white plaster in its upper part, and with red plaster in its lower part. Fragments of wall painting were recorded in both rooms. To the S of the anc. road the architectural remains were more fragmentary, and the over- all picture is rather obscure. Among the finds were a few walls, four small apothetes of HL-R date, and part of two floor sur- faces, of tiles and stone slabs respectively, with a small cistern in between (Fig. 65: plan of site). At the junction of Odos Platanista and a local road with- out name, part of R a mosaic floor was uncovered, with geo- metric decoration (central medallion enclosing a six-leaved rosette, and a border with spirals), as well as part of another floor surface (terracotta slabs), a terracotta drain of an inverted H-shape, and part of a plastered stone wall, forming one side of a room laid with a white marble floor, of LHL date. A num- ber of consecutive rooms of another house of LR date were dis- covered in Odos Dioskouron; the easternmost contained a storage pithos, placed in the trodden earth floor. In the same plot were also recorded sections of walls, pottery and figurines of the LHL period, as well as a cache of 24 4th-Ct AD bronze coins. I n i ' L'TXIO .i~~~ 3 65.

In a small pit, below the NW corner of the R cistern, were recorded stones and sherds of the EA period.

In a small stone structure in the same area were dis- covered 27 bronze coins (square I), while in another square (II) were discovered two successive destruction levels from the roof of a building, and part of a mosaic floor. In the central sec- tor were found various road surfaces of an anc. road, running NE-SW between two insulae, which was perhaps the S con- tinuation of the via colonnata, already identified in Odos Triakosion. The road was there dated to the period immediate- ly after the destruction of AD 267. Under the anc. road were recorded two terracotta cylindrical drains, also running NE-SW, the E one exposed for a length of 15m, and the W one for only 5m. In the E sector were recorded only parts of walls and extensive destruction levels. Among the portable finds were a marble male bust and a great number of coins. The S sector yielded the upper part of a stone-built drain (SE-NW) and the continuation of the drain discovered in a neighbouring plot, while in the SWsector were recorded only the remains of walls of inferior quality and limited destruction levels. In Odos Kallikratide (Liakakou plot) the excavation was completed of part of a R building, discovered in the W part of the plot, and five successive road surfaces of an anc. road, as well as scanty remains of a HL building in the central and E parts of the plot. In the R building two phases were distin- guished, the earlier one dating from the late 1St Ct BC/early 1st Ct AD, and the later one from the 2nd Ct AD; with the latter phase was associated a fragmentary mosaic floor. The anc. road, under which ran a number of terracotta drains, both parallel and at right angles to the road, probably led to the anc. theatre. Below the road were recorded the scanty remains of the HL building. 66, 67. Sparta: basilica In Odos Platanista, apart from the discovery of isolated walls, of probably R date, was also recorded a rectangular room, occupied continuously, from the ER to the EByz period. The room had plastered walls, and two water conduits, located under the floor, of which nothing is preserved. After the destruction of the building by fire, the level of the interior was artificially raised and the building was reused. It was erected during LR-EByz times, and went out of use during the MByz period. Finally, architectural remains and two cist tombs of R/LR date, were recorded in Odos Triakosion, in a plot, next to which had been discovered a LR building with an impressive mosaic floor. (ADelt 30, 1975, 74) In Odos Kallikratide (Lambraki plot) were unearthed sec- tions of successive road surfaces of trodden earth, gravel and pottery sherds, dating from the HL/R periods, as well as the remains of a wall, while more sections of anc. roads were located in the plot of the Techniko Lykeio Spartes and in Odos Lysandrou. In the former the earliest road surface, run- ning NW-SE, was constructed of small stones, with an even upward slope towards the W. On either side of the anc. road were located the remains of four walls. The pottery dated from the LC and HL periods. (ADelt 120-44) By the road from Sparta to Kalamata were recorded the remains of two walls and part of a stone-paved floor, dated to the ER period. (ADelt 144-5) Sparta Basilica Project. Rebecca Sweetman (BSA) reports: 'In a collaborative project between the 5th EBA of Sparta and the BSA, the first year was directed by Evi Katsara and Rebecca Sweetman. The basilica (Fig. 66), known as that of Osios Nikon and located just 50m E of the theatre on the acropolis, has been var- iously dated to the 6th, 7th and 10th Cts, with 10th- or lth-Ct additions. Likely to have been the episcopal seat at some point, the basilica has architectural parallels in churches such as Agios Titos in Crete and Aboba in Bulgaria, neither of which have been securely dated. One of the overall aims of the proj- ect is to date the basilica securely, which will help to establish whether or not it is that of Osios Nikon and assist the dating of several basilicas in the Balkans. The aim of the first year was to clean the area of the basilica, internally and externally, to facilitate the creation of a state plan. Cleaning also facilitated the examination of con- texts previously exposed during the excavations of Cuttle, Adamantiou and Soteriou. The project also aimed to com- pare the findings recorded by Cuttle in his unpublished exca- vation notebooks with the present state of the basilica. The ultimate aim is to publish Cuttle's work of the 1920s in addi- tion to a new and accurate plan of the basilica and its out- lying buildings. Kieran O'Connor and Nigel McGuirk created the new state plan of the basilica using a Total Station (Fig. 67). The new plan will be used to enable future excavation work. Other team members drew the elevations of most of the walls of the church and the W building. This facilitated a close study of the walls, and each re-used architectural fragment was recorded; these included various theatre seats and part of a lion's head spout. As much information as possible was recorded regarding the standing remains, and discrepancies with the records of Cuttle, Adamantiou and Soteriou were noted. The study and cleaning gave rise to new ideas, about the chronology and phasing of the basilica, and the use of space and identification of particular features. For example, it is clear that there were a number of phases of use: the W building was certainly constructed after the basilica and there are a number</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 37 Theatre.

Sparta: basilica, N apse of phases within the buildings. The peribolos walls are likely a RI2000 to be of later construction than the church, and have at least o " two phases. There are also at least two phases of construction in the basilica itself, particularly noticeable in the addition of the N annex and the minaret room. At least three phases are \/ identifiable in the W building: the cruciform building, the stair- way and the long W extension.

Although some are likely to be con- temporary, there is evidence to suggest that there was an earli- er floor type which was replaced.

C In the forthcoming season we will continue with cleaning and planning, with further studies on use of space. When this work is completed we hope to be able to say with confidence what the basilica and its complex looked like, and to offer a more accurate chronology for the foundation of the basilica / and its subsequent phases.' 69. Aigeira: settlement area</page><page sequence="38">38 DAVID BLACKMAN 70. Aigeira: Solon plot area ca 15 x 10m was examined in eight trenches, so that for the first time light is shed on the building's groundplan. In the W and probably also the N the foundations of the outer walls could be traced, in addition to numerous internal partition walls. From this it follows that the building possessed three E-W axes; the central axis, with a room without a solid floor and a room containing water, links up with both the andron and the groups of rooms in the N and S (Fig. 70). The uncovering of all the preserved sections of the row of klinai and the pebble mosaic in the andron allows the follow- ing assessment of the decorative scheme of the floor. The lay- out of the mosaic as already known from the previous excava- tions is confirmed: in a central panel a clothed female figure on a marine creature faces the entrance; a surrounding frieze con- tains panthers and griffins, which, corresponding to the room divisions, were represented in different patterns of movement; and the remaining triangular spandrels accommodate a com- plex decorative system of flowers and tendrils. The icono- graphic affinity to pebble mosaics in Sikyon, Corinth and Eretria allows a dating in the mid-4th Ct BC at the latest. The straight joints and different building phases which were observed in a number of places point to continuous repairs or rebuildings, the chronology of which for the time being remains uncertain. As can be deduced, e.g., from the consistent removal of stone thresholds, the house appears to have been abandoned in an orderly manner, probably already before the R Imperial period. To the W of this building at a distance of ca 4mis a further structure on the same orientation, the use of which is as yet unclear. In the area between, three water pipes were found in a hard pebble packing, suggesting a paved road between two buildings or plots. There are reasons for assuming that at least for a part of the Solon plot, on a terrace immediately below the acropolis to the N, there was an organized building scheme. In the course of examining the architectural evidence for the sanctuary on the acropolis from the excavations of W. Alzinger, new investigations were started and '": - 18 conglomerate blocks, mostly built into a mod. enclosure wall, were recorded. The exact stereo- metric cutting, the similarity of measurements and the presence of anathyrosis and pry-holes point towards a use of these blocks in the lower part of a monumental building. A connection of these architectural members with the LA temple, which W. Alzinger reconstructs from stretches of a foun- dation and architectural terracottas, seems likely. X~. .-. Additional evidence for a monumental A building in the area of the acropolis is provided by the find of a discarded, fragmented Doric sandstone capi- tal, its echinus curve suggesting a dating after the mid-6th Ct BC. City fortifications: large-scale fires in July 2000 in the settlement area of Aigeira revealed numerous previously unknown walls on the S flank of the acropolis and to the SE of the theatre. Stretches of foundations and wall sections, with up to five courses of blocks preserved, were exam- ined over a length of ca 80m along a distinctive NW-SE contour line to the S of the acropolis. These are partly at least remains of the fortification wall, which encircled the city to the S of the ^ggg®sBwe acropolis and which had been built in a particular- ly suitable location. Anomalies in the course of the double-faced wall, in connection with the street discovered in the Solon plot excavations, suggest the existence of a S-facing gate. To the SE of the theatre architectural remains were recorded over a length of ca 1 OOm; they belong to the fortification wall as well as to the LR water supply system. Stretches of wall of an R Imperial brick building disturb a section of the fortifica- tion wall and are probably connected with the above- mentioned water supply system. In addition, two terrace walls made from spolia were found to the SE of the city wall. The geological survey continued the activities of 1999 and comprised research into the geological and hydrogeological structure of the wider settlement area of Aigeira.' Alissos. The bottom part of a G pithos-burial, and a G tumulus a little to its SE, were recorded at the site of Kamenitsa. (ADelt 227-8) Ano Mazaraki (Rakita). During the seventh season of work at the temple of Artemis, the most important discovery was the identification of the semi-circular form of the prostoon of the latter, which balanced the apsidal form of the other end of the building (Fig. 71). The prostoon was founded on five poros bases, which supported rectangular piers, and not cylindrical wooden columns as is indicated by the clay model from the Argive Heraion. Although ellipsoidal buildings are known dur- ing this period at Eretria, nevertheless the form of the prostoon with the five bases, and the ovoid form of the building as a whole, are unique. It seems that the roofing of the peristyle was independent of that of the main building: namely, while the lat- ter would have been a single double-pitched roof, which would have included the two apsidal ends, thus solving the problem of roofing the prosto6n, the peristyle would have had a sepa- rate roof, at a lower level. No traces of an interior colonnade, as was the case with the building at Lefkandi, were preserved. It is possible that the interior width of the building (5.90m) would allow the walls to be bridged with transverse beams, although the possibility of wooden columns without bases</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 39 should not be excluded. The roof consisted originally of reeds and clay, mixed with straw, but was soon replaced by Cor tiles, possibly during the 6th Ct BC. The suggestion that the columns of the peristyle bore wooden capitals seems to be supported by the discovery of a second clay model of a Doric shaft and cap- ital, with spiral carving. The exterior dimensions of the temple (34.40 x lm; 29.90 x 7.50m without the peristyle and the prostoon) suggest that this was an hekatompedon building, almost identical in length to the apsidal temple of Apollo Daphnephoros at Eretria. The temple was founded in a level of the LG period, which suggests that it was erected during the late 8th/early 7th Ct BC. The temple, both as regards its plan and the construction details, is very similar to the hero6n at Lefkandi. An extensive destruction layer indicated that the building was destroyed by an earthquake, followed by fire, in the first half of the 4th Ct BC, possibly that of 373 BC. Although the temple was not repaired, the finds in the apo- thetes and the fill of the temple continue up to the 4th Ct AD, suggesting that some kind of worship continued at the site until that period. (ADelt 220-5) Arravonitsa. To the S of the mod. village were located three tumuli of MH date, one of which was investigated by the then Ephor N. Zapheiropoulos in the mid-1950s. To the S and the E were identified buildings of a large HL settlement. (ADelt 227) Chalandritsa. On the SE edge of the mod. village, at the site of an important Myc settlement at Stavros, dated to the LH IIIB-C period, the S limits of the site were investigated, as well as the foundations of at least three rooms. Among the finds were a steatite sealstone, bearing a linear motif, and a number of stone 'buttons'. One more chamber tomb, with a rectangu- lar chamber, was investigated in the Myc cemetery of Ag. Vasileios, and yielded pottery of the LH IIIC period. (ADelt 216-17) A report is given of the Frankish tower of Tremouille, part of the castle built by the Dramelay family mentioned in the Chronicle of the Morea (A. Bon, La Moree franque [1969], 458-63). Masonry is very close in style to that on towers on the Acrocorinth and evidently dates to the 13th Ct. (ADelt 259) Flamboura. In the mod. cemetery of the village were found a pithos, in situ, and a number of tiles on the surface, probably the remains of an anc. settlement or farmhouse.

During rescue excavations in the Myc cemetery, three chamber tombs were investigated, one of which (tomb 2) included the remains of at least 31 skeletons and 58 vases; in the chamber were recorded four pits, dug into the floor. The tomb seems to have been in continuous use from the LH IIIA to the LH IIIC period. In the second tomb (tomb 3), only an ellipsoidal niche with the skeleton of a child was preserved. As for the third tomb (tomb 4), the roof of which had collapsed, the chamber although originally circular, was during its long use extended in all directions, and eventually acquired an irregular form; it was in continuous use from the LH IIB to the LH IIIC period. In the same area was also exca- vated an isolated cist-tomb of MH date. The estimated number of graves in the cemetery, based on the excavated examples (14), is at least 70, making this the most extensive Myc ceme- tery in Aigialeia, and the only Myc cemetery in the coastal area of anc. Helike. A considerable number of Myc chamber tombs, four of which were completely destroyed, were identi- fied in the nearby area of Langades, while at the site of Pleures were found two further destroyed chamber tombs. (ADelt 233-6) A. Papadopoulos investigated four new unlooted chamber tombs, of the usual type, in the Myc cemetery. Their dromoi were short and rock-cut, their entrances small, sealed with dry- stone walling, and their chambers either circular or elliptical in plan. Tomb XIX contained only one, adult burial, which was accompanied by eight vases and two rings - one bronze, one gold - and was situated in the E section of the small chamber. Tomb XX contained five burials in two layers: two in the lower, the rest above. The grave-goods comprised four com- mon vases and a spindle-whorl; one burial had nothing. Tomb XXI held at least 15 burials in two successive layers, or in piles of bones, set up against the sides of the chamber. Once again, the grave-goods were fewer than the number of burials, name- ly five vases (two three-handled piriform jars, a stirrup-jar, a cylindrical alabastron and a handleless spherical miniature pithos), a spindle-whorl, a steatite sealstone, a carnelian bead, a bronze knife and part of a pin. Tomb XXII had eight burials, in two layers. Again the grave-goods were meagre: two small vessels, a bronze knife and handle, a steatite seal-stone, a clay spindle-whorl and numerous beads from a necklace of faience, steatite, carnelian and glass-paste. The date range for the burials is given as LH IIIA-C. (Ergon 2000, 55-57) Kastritsi. Part of a large R farmhouse was located at the site of Panagia, including a range of walls, the hypocaust room of the baths, a room with a mosaic floor, a cistern, and parts of other rooms. Below the R house were identified remains of the HL period, possibly an ancestor of the R farm, which seemed to control the entire narrow fertile plain between Kato and Ano Kastritsi. During the systematic surface survey of the hill of Ortos, the discovery of LH IIIB-C pottery on the top of the hill suggests the presence of a Myc acropolis, con- trolling the Rio-Antirrio crossing. Cave-like open- er' v ings in the slope of the hill may represent remnants s7 ^ .) of chamber tombs. (ADelt 218-9) Kato Achaia. Building remains of HL date, involving workshop or commercial activities, were recorded in Odos Achaikes Sympoliteias. (ADelt 225) Manesi. Ten cist-tombs of EByz date were partly destroyed at the site of Tritaia. (ADelt 220) _ -. . v</page><page sequence="40">40 DAVID BLACKMAN 72. Patras: Roman farmhouse Midilogli. Architectural remains of a small LR farmstead were located at the site of Chatzeliakou, to the S of Patras. The finds indicate installations for the preparation of gypsum, a considerable quantity of which, in solidified form, was discov- ered among the remains. In the NE sector of the complex a low solid semi-circular structure was recorded, probably associated with some stage of the gypsum preparation, with a slightly inclined floor surface and a drain at the centre of its NW side; on the NE side, an outflow channel led to a pithos. To the E of the complex was investigated a rectangular cistern, coated with lime plaster, with a hollow in its bottom for the collection of impurities, possibly associated with the treading of grapes. Among the other areas investigated was the hypocaust, and some rooms to its NW, with plastered floors. (ADelt 225-7) Remains of a Byz structure have been identified in the fab- ric of the post-Byz basilica church of the Metamorphosis. Parts of the original apse were found (tri-apsidal, with three-sided apses constructed with marble spolia and cloisonn6 masonry). The spolia would appear to have originated from an earlier structure (ECh basilica?). (ADelt 258) Patras. In 1995 46 rescue excavations were carried out in the mod. city of Patras, almost all of which yielded domestic and funerary remains of the R/LR period. 73. Patras: wine press The only instance of a public building outside the agora was discovered in Odos Al. Ypselandou: a nymphaeum, located ca 80m N of the amphitheatrical building, identified as the sta- dium. The structure, which was fitted with niches and semicircular exedrai, can be dated to the LR period. Two other nymphaea were identified: one, ^ a [ a little to the S, at the junction of the two central [ ' I stone-paved roads of the town, and the other on the coastal road of Akte Dymaion. At the junction of Odos Kanakare and Miaoule, at the commercial centre of the R city, very near the anc. harbour, a series of walls was discovered, some coated with red plaster, and parts of two mosaic floors, one decorated with geometric motifs, the other with a band of ivy. In Odos Metropolitou Neophytou a HL gravel road was recorded, also used in the R period, run- ning E-W for a length of 8.50m (w. 4m), with parts of build- ings on either side. Of the building to its S, which was proba- bly part of the important R house excavated in a neighbouring plot, part of a built drain was investigated, and parts of two trodden earth floors. The built drain and the small shallow rec- tangular basin-like construction, built of convex tiles, among the remains of the building to the N of the road, suggest that it was associated with some kind of workshop installation. Another R gravel road, with buildings on either side, was dis- covered in Odos Ag. Demetriou. The road (w. 3.75m), which ran N-S for a length of 6.60m, was in use from the HL period, and it probably crossed the road discovered in the preceding plot, at right angles. Of the building to its W, part of a mosaic floor was discovered, decorated with geometric motifs, and it seems that this was part of the same important house found in the preceding plot, which was bordered by roads on both the E and N. Of the building to the E of the road, only isolated walls were recorded. It seems that drains from the houses led to a central drain, running under the road. Isolated walls, or parts of buildings, in some cases associ- ated with destruction layers or fragments of mosaic floors, were recorded in Karaiskake, at the junction of Odos Gounare and Votsare, in Odos Alexadrou Ypselandou, in Odos 12ou Syntagmatos, in Odos Ag. Demetriou (2), in Odos Vasileiou Rouphou, in Parodos Ag. Demetriou, in Odos Eleias, in Odos Boukoure, at the junction of Odos Papadiamantopoulou and Distomou, in Odos Germanou, at the junction of Odos Eynardou and Pantokratoros (walls and part of a cistern, red plaster fragments), in Odos Thermopylon, in Odos Gounare (HL-R walls, cistern), in Odos Pantokratoros, in Odos Niketa (HL, R, EByz), in Odos Erenstrole, at the junction of Odos Papadiamandopoulou and Achaidos Athenas. In the outskirts of the mod. city, similar remains were recorded at Exo Agyia, in Odos Lambrou Porphyra. A section of a R road was located in Odos Konstantinou Palaiologou, running N-S and associat- ed with two fragmentary walls of the same date. Another type of domestic building encountered in the area was the farmstead, specimens of which were recorded both inside the mod. town of Patras and in its periphery. In Odos Thermopylon, below and W of the new motorway section which forms the W entrance to the mod. city, an extensive part of a R farmhouse was discovered, including 14 rooms, espe- cially areas for the processing of agricultural products, like wine and grain, and a considerable number of storage pithoi, four of which were found in situ (Fig. 72). Among the remains discovered was a wine-press, i.e. a rectangular cistern (A1) for the treading of grapes, with a smaller cistern (A2) at a lower level to the W, which was provided with a staircase for access (Fig. 73). The must was channelled from the main wine-press</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 41 74. Patras: farmhouse with Hellenistic remains to the smaller cistern, via a terracotta pipe. At the bottom of the main wine-press were discovered the remains of four floor sur- faces, constructed in opus figlinum and coated with water- proof plaster; the latter was also found inside the second cis- tern. Part of a third cistern (A3) in an room to the S, which was floored with square terracotta slabs bearing double X-shaped incisions, also communicated with the smaller cistern (A2). The floor surface of a fourth small cistern (A4), identical to A3, was also recorded in the area, while in another room (X3) a cir- cular stone grinder for grain (di. 80cm) was discovered, incor- porated within a rectangular built structure with a terracotta slab floor, and coated with a double layer of red plaster. The ground product would originally have been kept in this struc- ture, and would have been subsequently stored in the pithoi, found in the same area. In room X9, a built conical cistern, coated with waterproof plaster, was apparently also used for storage. Ten burials of R and ECh date (nine tile-roofed, one pithos-burial), were recorded in various areas of the farm. Judging by the use of a number of HL walls as bases for the R masonry of the complex (Fig. 74), it is very possible that this was originally a HL farm, which was extended and used throughout the R period, until the end of the 6th Ct AD. The architectural remains of another extensive R farm were discovered by the coast road of the city, on Akte Dymaion, probably a villa maritima providing the market with fish. Among the remains identified was part of a central open- air courtyard with a well, and rectangular rooms to its E, N and W. In one of those rooms were preserved an hypocaust and patches of a mosaic floor; to the S of the court lay a large cistern, and in its SE cor- - . ner a stone paved area was preserved, possibly a road, running N-S. Beside the road was found a construction with 11 shallow hollows in a row, lined with wood. Part of another R farm was recorded in Exo Agyia, at the junction of Odos &amp; Ladonos and Kalomoire, including installations for a wine press (Fig. 75). Finally, remains of a LR farm were discovered at Kato Sychaina, in Parodos AZ15, of which four rectangular rooms were investigated, including a circular built cis- tern, divided into two parts, with a funnel-shaped lower part (Fig. 76). Many of the walls had been built on HL foundations, while the entire area was used as a cemetery in the ECh period. Remains of workshops of HL and R date were recorded 1.300m N of the R bridge across the river Meilichos, on the local road to Aigion (Odos Theoph. Korydaleos). The complex includ- 76. Patras, 75. Patras, o Agya: Roman farmhouse 75. Patras, Exo Agyia: Roman farmhouse ed three kilns, two of which were two-storey and circular, the third ovoid, as well as a built cistern, all bordered on the NNW by a wall facing an anc. road (NE-SW) (Fig. 77). The latter was 6m wide and had a stone and gravel surface. The two cir- cular kilns, of R date and used for the manufacture of tiles and bricks, preserved their subterranean firing chambers, with the central supports, as well as the mouths of the stoking channels, which had a common starting point (Fig. 78); here was found a large pit, containing refuse from the kilns. The third kiln, of HL date, was incorporated within a rectangular space, while to the W was a trapezoidal HL cistern. A milestone found in the firing chamber of one of the two kilns bore two Latin inscrip- tions, one of emperor Trajan (AD 114/115), the other of the emperors Arcadius and Honorius (AD 397), suggesting that the R public road to Aigion had been incorporated in the road- building program of Trajan for the E provinces, which was closely linked to his Parthian Campaign. Finally, among the funerary remains in the area of the mod. city a funerary monument of the R period, part of the N cemetery, was recorded in Odos Gerokostopoulou; in the same plot, and associated with the monument, was also found part of the stone stylobate of a stoa, with two Ionic column bases, and a section of the shaft of an unfluted column. The remains of a large R bath complex, located just to the W, were also associated with the N cemetery. Another section ----- ---- -* * , *E I ,-_.-&gt; ~ ~~~~... . i ·^/fl' ..

The surface of this :- road, which was preserved for a length of llm, consisted of river stones laid over a trodden earth layer. In its vicinity was found part of a funerary peribolos, while on either side of the road were excavated 46 tombs (39 tile-roofed, 7 cist-tombs). Particularly noteworthy was an above-ground tomb of the small columbarium type, with a rectangular plan and a monumental appearance, facing the road (Fig. 79). In Odos Asemake Photela, part of the S ceme- tery of the anc. city was excavated, including remains of rectangular funerary periboloi contain- ing built cist-tombs and a single tile-roofed grave of the R period, as well as a group of five built cist-tombs in the NW comer of the plot. Part of another R cemetery was recorded in Odos Ag. Triadas, in the S part of the mod. town, including two tile-roofed graves and a rectangular solid con- &lt;5 crete structure, possibly a burial complex, as well i as a gravel road, possibly funerary. Fragmentary -:e.r' walls, possibly part of a funerary peribolos, as well as six graves (two tile-roofed, four cists) of LR date, were located in Odos Lontou. (ADelt 192-216) i| ~ ~ In the systematic survey of the general area | .- around the mod. town of Patras, in co-operation with the Centre for Greco-Roman Antiquity of the National Research Centre, a total of 31 sites have been identified ranging from the EH period to the Turkish era. The absence of a major centre in this long narrow plain, along the W bank of the Phoinikas river, and the exis- tence of a multitude of small sites, supports the identification of the region with anc. Rypai. (ADelt 231-3) Two R and ECh grave enclosures came to light on Odos Kalabryton with burials of nearly all types (ADelt 263-4). On Odos Niketa 74, further evidence was found for burials of the ECh cemetery in the vicinity. These burials, however, (ten 'four-sided' graves in four successive rows, seven of which contained double burials) have tentatively been identified as being of victims of an earthquake in the city in the mid-6th Ct. (ADelt 264-5) A Byz (?) pottery kiln was uncovered on Odos Boukaoure 89. Only a part of the furnace was preserved (3 x 2.80 m). (ADelt 265) 78. Patras: kiln of the same N cemetery was revealed at the junction of Odos Konstantinoupoleos, Norman, and Paxon, including part of a R burial chamber containing six built cist-tombs. In the N part of the chamber was found an ovoid, funnel-shaped structure, with built sides, possibly used for worship. In the centre of the plot were excavated eight tile-roofed graves, two pit-graves and six cist-tombs; the two pit-graves were HL. At the junction of Odos Stratokleous and Katerines, four more tile-roofed graves were located, part of the same cemetery, while at the junction of Odos Amerikes, Thermopylon and the new national road to Athens was investigated the N-S funerary road which crosses the N cemetery and continues outside the city as a via publica 79.

Evidence exists for an original timber roof and masonry templon screen. Pottery and coins (anonymous folles Al A2) indicate a 12th-Ct date, with use during the 14th Ct attested by Frankish coins. R wall ruins came to light 0.20m below this structure, along with coins of Caracalla and earlier HL denominations (Elis 271-191 BC, and a Zakynthian coin of the mid-4th Ct BC). (ADelt 265-7) Portes. The second year of the rescue excavation at the PR cemetery near Portes investigated another row of built rectan- gular graves, surrounded by a low built peribolos wall and forming the perimeter of a tumulus (tumulus F). The best pre- served tomb was unusually large in size (1.60 x 8m), with an opening on the E. It was associated with pottery of the MH III/LH I-II periods. In the E part of this tumulus was located an unlooted chamber tomb (T3), with a well-cut but very sloping dromos, a medium-sized, circular chamber and two primary burials on a thin layer of white clay. An unusually rich array of jewellery accompanied the female skeleton and part of a set of bronze armour (pair of greaves, sword, knife, bronze mitra) the male, probably a warrior. The pottery associated with the for- mer dated from the LH IIIB2/IIIC period, while that associat- ed with the latter dated from the early LH IIIC period. (ADelt 217-18) Pournokastro: Remains of the Castel Coraro (Cumero Castro - Curaro Castro - Cuzanaro Castro) are reported on the heights above the present village. Only a partially-ruined square tower survives (h. ca 2.50m), surrounded by piles of what would have been the stones of the enclosure wall. (ADelt 259) Salmeniko. At the site of Elleniko, an extensive surface sur- vey of the area, which was carried out as part of a European Research Program (Gost G2), under the general direction of Dr A. Rizakes, director of the Centre of Greco-Roman Antiquity of the National Research Centre, involved the investigation of the ellipsoidal building at the top of the Ag. Georgios hill, as well as part of another building (25.90 x 12.80m). The wall of the ellipsoidal building, stone-built on both faces, was filled with earth and rubble, while the associated pottery can be dated to the R period. (ADelt 238) Starochori Prevedou. At the site of Magoula were excavated the remains of a large A-C circular building (di. 22.50m), divided by two walls into four equal parts, which were then subdivided into smaller areas, some of which contained pithoi for storage. Judging by the presence of column bases in the vicinity, it is probable that the thin exterior wall bore a colon- nade, possibly wooden. Workshop material for the manufac- ture of terracotta tiles, of R date, was recorded at the site of Vasiliko. (ADelt 219) Trapeza Aigiou. At the archaeological site of Trapeza parts of two stone sarcophagi and of a burial pithos of the A period were recorded. In a detailed survey and planning of all visible remains in the Trapeza area, parts of large buildings were locat- ed, as well as the foundations of a C building and the site of an A temple. (ADelt 238-9) AITOLIA-AKARNANIA Palairos.

Dr Jari Pakkanen (Finnish Institute) reports on research carried out in summer 2000 in the sanctu- ary of Zeus at Stratos: 'The most important aim of the research is to clarify the problems related to the reconstruction of the temple of Zeus by means of building measurements at the site, and to make a com- parative study of the building more feasible. The temple was never completed - for example, the columns were never fluted - so the building lends itself to study of its design and execu- tion. During the four-week field season the group mapped and measured 113 column drums and 11 capitals; 72 of the temple drums are at least fairly well preserved. A preliminary analysis of the exterior and porch column shafts shows that a previous reconstruction of the exterior order proposed by F. Courby and Ch. Picard in 1924 is most probably correct. The exterior col- umn comprised nine drums and, due to the greatly varying height of individual elements, the reconstructed column height range is fairly large, approximately 7.8-8.3m. A more precise estimate can be reached on the basis of pronaos and opisthodomos column shafts: eight of the original 28 drums are preserved in good condition and can be identified with certain- ty among the blocks at the site. The porch shafts were more fully worked than the exterior columns and lack the bosses which were still in place on the exterior shafts. The porch shafts consisted of seven drums and we have a well-fitting sequence of five drums from the bottom, then a poorly pre- served sixth drum and a good seventh drum. Unfortunately, there are no porch capitals at the site, but based on the shaft and a comparative analysis of capitals, the column height can be restored as approximately 7.3m, which is 6.1 times the lower diameter. The height of the exterior order columns can there- fore be reconstructed as approximately 7.9 m, which is 6 times the lower diameter. The column proportions are surprisingly squat for the end of the 4th Ct, and a proportional analysis and some details of column execution could possibly suggest that the column was originally designed higher and the project was only later scaled down due to a lack of finances. To clarify these issues a further and final two-week field season will be carried out in summer 2001.' Thermon: I. Papapostolou finished excavating levels beneath the temple of Apollo Thermios, where megaron B is located (Fig. 80). The project began in 1992, and included a re- checking of the results of previous campaigns by G. Soteriades and K. Romaios. Undisturbed fills of megaron B only exist beneath the walls, the stylobate and the bases of the internal colonnade of the temple, and cannot, therefore, be excavated. The old excavations have confused the stratigraphy as much as the ancients, as no notebooks or plans exist. During 2000, part of an undisturbed fill was investigated beneath the E wall of the inner shrine of the temple of Apollo, belonging to levels from the middle room of megaron B (Fig. 81). Some indica- tions were found of a roofed area belonging to post-megaron but pre-temple levels.

However, three new categories can be added to the . ...._ typology of the cemetery burials: XXXI is a rudimentary rec- tangular pit, cut into the creviced rock; within it, the body must have been place on a wooden bier or inside a coffin, as indi- -- - - cated by the material found in the four comers of the burial; !</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 45 XXXVII is a typical tile-roofed tomb; XXX, XXXIX, XL and XLIII are small irregular pit-burials covered with tile, which may be cist-graves or tile-roofed tombs or may contain a clay vessel. These are used exclusively for infant burials. A new architectural element is added to the category of built cist-grave burials: an above-ground construction of a solid truncated cone, which is set on the NE cover slab of buri- als XXXIII and XXXIV. Its SE side, facing towards the sea, is vertical with an arched opening. It seems that funerary votives would have been placed here. Of the total of 10 intact tombs, seven were single-use (five infants, two adults), whereas the rest contained more than two burials. Tomb XXXVIII is a built cist-grave, above ground (built on top of and not in the rock, as is normal for the cist-graves of the cemetery). Its NW long side is defined by the edges of tombs XXXIV and XXXVI, and its narrow sides are preserved to very little height, whereas its SE long side has been com- pletely destroyed. It was completely full of skeletal remains and skull fragments, belonging to individuals of all ages, including small children. Animal bone remains were also found scattered. Only in very few cases were isolated skeletal remains found in situ. It was impossible to obtain an accurate count of the skeletons, and no proper burial was found in situ. The grave goods are many, but only small finds. Possibly its long-term use, originally as a burial in which it was custom- aryy to remove previous skeletal remains, led to its conversion into an ossuary; this alone could explain its destroyed form and disturbed contents. Its form and interior resemble those of tombs XIV and XVI, which were examined in 1993. All three examples indicate that they were built in haste, shallow with no cover slabs, although there was a ridge. They contained a vast amount of skeletal remains and small finds. The grave goods from all the burials are common to the period, such as bronze coins, gold danakae, jewellery made of gold, silver or bronze, beads, glass and clay vessels, etc. A large number of small nails, probably from a shoe, was found in the looted tomb XLI. The cemetery continues below the road and extends to the plot opposite, as shown by vaulted tomb XXXII: a third of the tomb is located within the excavated area and the other two thirds are below the road. Also to be noted are: a segment of an Ionian capital, the helix of which is still preserved, found in the excavation area; fragments of mosaic with vegetal decoration collected from the dumps of the mod. settlement - it was impossible to discover the origins of the dumps; ECh marble architectural elements in the courtyard of the mod. church, which is adjacent to our area. The search for a public R struc- ture in the same area might be productive. (ADelt 244-5) Poros. Drakaina Cave. Excavation by the EPS (M. Hatziote) continued in 1995, in seven of the ten old squares and three new ones, as did the removal of the archaeologically sterile limestone formation outside the cave (area y). In area a, excavation continued of the pit/apothetes of the sanctuary of the historical period partly excavated in 1994 (B2-3); the pit was cut into PR levels but disturbance of over- lying later levels made it impossible to define the horizon from which it was cut. The deposit contained, as before, large amounts of pottery and female protomai and figurines, mostly from groups of four figures dancing around a flute player (Fig. 82), associated with cult of the Nymphs which is also attested by an incised inscription on the neck of a vase of West Slope ware; a figurine of Pan indicates his cult also in the cave. The fill of the pit is so mixed and disturbed that it clearly represents a clearing out of the sanctuary in the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct BC at the latest. 82. Poros, Drakaina Cave: figurines In trench B6, under five sterile levels and immediately above the sterile clay sealing the PR deposit, a 6th-Ct BC work- ing horizon was found and a bothros with burnt walls and ash and a few sherds of mid-6th Ct pottery. In area P, extended excavation in Z3 and H3 confirmed the stratigraphic sequence of the 1993-94 trenches. A floor or working surface underlies deposits of FN/LNII (C 14 date from H3 (calibrated) 3961-3777 BC or 3992-3697 BC) and over- lies deposits of LNI (C14 date from H3 (calibrated) 4797-4540 BC or 4925-4459 BC). In Z4 two LNI levels were defined, the latter containing a sequence of hearths with C14 dates (calibrated) of 5266-5228 or 5279-5148 BC and 5210-5058 or 5221-4995 BC. An underlying level with a sequence of working surfaces and clay structures has not yet been dated by C14. The earliest absolute C14 date so far from the cave comes from the deposit in H5: (calibrated) 5417-5267 or 5435-5242 BC; it has not yet been related stratigraphically with other deposits. The archaeological material from the LNI deposits includes a few fragments of unbaked clay with branch or reed impressions, archaeological remains and remains of domestic and wild fauna; a large amount of by-products from local working of flint, but remains of flint tools were few, and of obsidian and bone even fewer. The pottery was plentiful, most- ly bellied open and closed shapes, with a few sherds of pol- ished, incised, plastic and polychrome wares. (ADelt 836-8) A study season was carried out in 1998, and excavation continued in 1999. (Epyov YnH02, 155; 3, 171) Same. At the site of Palioura, to the right of the newly-opened field road leading to the sea, a tile-roofed tomb was identified, having been brought to the Ephorate's attention by P. Favros from Same. The site is located in the NW foothills of the mountain on which the acropoleis of ancient Same are situat- ed, lkm away from the large acropolis, beyond the walls and at a distance from the C-R poleis. The tomb has a W-E orientation (total 1. 1.32m and w. 0.50m), and was partly defined externally by unworked slab- like stones. The skull was found 0. 1Om beyond the cover tiles, due to the declivity of the ground and a large rock that has fall- en onto the tomb. The body (female) had been placed on her back with her hands on her abdomen, in a W-E orientation (1. of skeleton 1.28m, skull h. 0.21m, pelvis w. 0.3 lm). Two silver earrings and a rounded glass fragment were found in the area of the skull.

A house, a shelter and a cesspit were built in this area during the 20th Ct, resulting in the dis- turbance of the ancient layers and the destruction of the walls. The remains date to the R and LR periods. The walls are pre- served to a height of ca 1.5m; the facades of the walls defining the entrance are built in the opus testaceum style. Part of a lime mortar floor was uncovered in area X1, at a depth of 1.72-1.84m, and part of another was found in area X6, at a depth of ca 0.95m, paved with irregular stone slabs. In order to the date the latter, two slabs were removed and a small trial trench was opened. Amongst the pottery were 2-3 fragments with 3rd/4th-Ct AD combed decoration, which establishes the earliest date for the construction of the floor. Finds include 20 R bronze coins and a bronze hinge with incised decoration. (ADelt 244) Of great importance are the EH remains from Phournoi near Same. (Epyov YInIO 3, 96) ELEIA Agia Maura. At the site of Keramidia, a built tomb and a pithos-burial of HL date were identified. (ADelt 174) Agia Triada. Five more chamber tombs, dating from the LH IIIA-IIIC periods, were investigated after illicit excavation in the Myc cemetery of Agia Triada, at the site of Spelies (cf. AR 1999-2000, 49). Four of the chambers had a circular shape, while the fifth was rectangular; the preserved roofs were tholoid. (ADelt 177-8) Augeio.

Various research and restoration programmes of the German Institute continued in 2000 under the overall direction of H. Kyrieleis; no excavation took place. The main emphasis was on measures for the preservation of monuments, coordi- nated and supervised by K. Herrmann. He reports: 'At the temple of Zeus, preliminary work on the rebuilding of column N 12, the second from the W on the N side, was ini- tiated. Several column drums were cleaned of lichen and lay- ers of stone that were in danger of flaking off were reinforced with injections. The missing part of column drum 6 was restored with special artificial stone, consisting essentially of chips of shelly limestone with hydraulic lime as a binding agent, and reinforced with threaded titanium rods (Fig. 83). The restorations, constructed with bosses, were later reworked to stonemason's standards. The material and the techniques are intended to ensure that the new elements largely match the consistency and surface structure of the original stone. In addition, a partial reconstruction of the Philippeion is at the planning stage. In order to compile a complete catalogue of all architectural elements, the krepis blocks which had been placed on the foundation had to be removed again. This also made possible a new, detailed survey of the entire foundation. Measurement of the column drums, of which about two thirds are preserved, confirmed the observation, made earlier, that the column height has to be reduced by one column drum to ca 5.55m. With regard to the re-arrangement of the site, the water channels and pipes in the vicinity of the Philippeion, which had been uncovered by the old excavations, were examined again. Most instructive was a location to the NW (Fig. 84). Here, a large C channel (in the foreground), which probably supplied the baths in the W, was built over by the Altis wall (left). In contrast to this, another channel (left, at the rear) was made to run in cascades out over the wall. The older channel was sev- ered by an EHL clay pipe (right) which, with a slight lowering and alteration of direction, goes on to run underneath the Altis wall. The relative chronology of the structures and some sherds that came to light during cleaning provide the first secure evidence that the Altis wall must have been built after the mid- 4th Ct. In the course of surveying work for a new overall map, the top of the walls of a large R building was uncovered W of the 'SW building'. The centre of this building consists of a small octagon, which is connected through doors with the neigh- bouring rooms. Since the depth of the fill measures about 4 to 5m, the remains can be expected to be very well preserved on the whole.</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 47 85. Phigaleia: double tomb 86. Diodia: Mycenaean tholos tomb In the context of the re-examination of the architecture of the temple of Zeus, the site plan of the architectural elements was revised and updated. In addition, drawings were made of selected parts of the entablature. After the excavations for the study project 'Olympia in the Roman Imperial period and Late Antiquity' under the direction of U. Sinn (Wurzburg) had ended in 1999, work now concen- trated on the documentation of the buildings and the analysis of the finds. In the SW building, photogrammetric pictures of all walls were taken and selected sections of foundation and walls were documented in detailed drawings. Moreover, the ruins in the SE part of the Altis that had been uncovered earlier were cleaned extensively. A major focus of the investigations was the area of the so-called octagon, where the E bathing rooms were documented in the framework of an architectural survey.' Peukes (Vyliza). At the site of Lithari was investigated anoth- er Myc chamber tomb, of LH IIIA2 date, the fourth in a group with three tombs excavated in the past. The chamber was circu- lar, with a tholoid roof, while in the W part of the chamber was recorded a slab-covered pit containing one burial. (ADelt 176) Phigaleia. Funerary remains of the 4th-3rd Ct BC were excavat- ed at the site of Trane Petra, on the W side of the anc. town, outside the walls. Among the remains was a double rock-cut tomb, oriented N-S, with a narrow open-air anteroom in the facade; the two chambers were separated by a built wall (Fig. 85). To the W were located two more double tombs, with sim- ilarly impressive temple-like facades, that resemble the Alipheira funeral monuments. The best-preserved specimen had three wide piers on the facade, supporting a pediment. In the rectangular openings between the piers were niches for the dead, closed by single slabs. A fourth grave of similar type was identified 20m higher, on the same slope; they were all looted. (ADelt 175-6) Sdouga hill.

Remains of a C temple-like building were recorded on the hill of Petroula, at the site of Agios Elias. (ADelt 186) Chalkias. At the site of Aelias were found two Myc tholos tombs; this is a new Myc site, ca 14km N of Malthe and 4km N of Psarion. The first tomb was looted in antiquity, and was preserved to a height of 2.10m (di. 4.10m). The second tholos, 9.50m to the N, was of similar dimensions, but its dromos was totally destroyed. Both tombs were used from the LH IIA-B to the LH IIIB period. On a nearby hillock, at the site of Kroikanos, was located the mouth of a third tholos tomb, which has not yet been investigated. (ADelt 183-4) Diodia. The excavation of the Myc tholos tomb, reported in 1992 1200m SW of the mod. village, was completed this year (Fig. 86). It was oriented E-W, and was semi-subterranean, with a tumulus over the upper parts of its tholos roof (di. 4.20m, h. 2.30m). The dromos consisted of a short cutting in the bedrock, with a steeply sloping surface. The entrance had a monolithic lintel, and was blocked with a dry stone wall. At a depth of ca im from the highest course of the tholos was found the skeleton of a horse, lying on its right side, almost against the W wall. The Myc deposit contained human bones and offerings, and included at least 15 burials. The associated pottery includ- ed 22 intact vases of the LH IIIA-B periods, with some sherds of the LH I/II period. Two rhyta (one conical, one pear-shaped) were found together in situ, in the NE part of the chamber with a krater. Nearby were also discovered a beaked pear-shaped jug with a conical base and a one-handled funnel-shaped cup, also used as rhyta (Fig. 87). The tomb must have belonged to a cemetery of a typical Myc settlement, on the W side of the Messenian Gulf (area of Rizomylos).

Diodia: pottery from Mycenaean tomb Ellenika Antheias. Three more Myc chamber tombs were investigated this year, part of the group of 24 tombs identified in the area, of which six had already been excavated. The well-preserved first tomb (7) had a circular chamber (di. 4.15m, h. 2m), with a small niche to the right of the entrance containing funeral offerings, and was approached by a flat dromos (1. 7.10m, w. 2.03m); it can be dated in the LH IIIA2-IIIB 1 period. The second tomb (8) had a semi-circular chamber, a pit just inside the entrance and a very short dromos (1. lm); it can be dated in the LH IIIA2 period. Finally, the third tomb (9) had a circular chamber, a shallow niche carved in the soft rock opposite the entrance, and four pits, dug in the floor of the chamber, and was approached by a long dromos (1. 8.80m). From the N side of the chamber, an opening led to a rectangular side-chamber, with a saddle- roof. The associated pottery dated from the Myc and the HL period (4th-3rd C BC). (ADelt 178-9) Iklaina. During a surface survey by M. Kosmopoulos, quanti- ties of LH IIIA-B pottery, flint tools and fragments of figurines were found at Traganes, a site excavated decades ago by Sp. Marinatos. Squared blocks were found in other parts of the area, indicating the existence of a large structure, perhaps a tholos tomb. Marinatos' excavation and this new work indicate that Iklaina was an important Myc centre, though whether it had a palace or not is another matter. (Ergon 2000, 71) Manesi. The investigation of the circular building at the site of Maurolongos, lkm N of the mod. village, which has the appearance of a tholos tomb, but without entrance and dromos, did not further the clarification of its date and function. (ADelt 179-80) Messene: Investigations under the direction of P. Themelis went on at various locations in the ancient city (Fig. 88). The theatre, identified through excavation, was destroyed during the Byz period, by the local inhabitants who used it as a source of building material. Despite this, some of the stairs were found that led spectators from the exterior terrace of the cavea to the upper diazoma of the theatre. Other remains of stairs at the bottom of the cavea allowed the general reconstruction of the theatre, for the period of the R occupation. The form of the proscenium, where the remains are more substantial, included three niches, the middle one semicircular, while the left and right were rectangular. All three held statues, the bases of which were found in 1999 and 2000. The S aisle of the EByz basilica, to the SE of the theatre, was also uncovered. The church was repaired and altered in MByz and later Byz periods; breast-plates and helmets are dated to the MByz period. Tombs of the 7th-8th Cts AD were found in the S aisle during 1999 and in 2000 a rectangular ossuary was discovered, outside the apse of the aisle, dated to the 7th Ct AD. In the NE sector of the agora, a larger-than-life marble bust was found bearing a marked resemblance to the Emperor Claudius, at a ripe age. The statue would have been erected in the area of the agora, the most frequented place of Messene. At the heroon, in the NW comer of the gymnasium, behind the N stoa, a pit was found, filled with fragments of small ves- sels, many of which contained dried fruits. In the vicinity of the vases were found seeds, fragments of figurines, clay relief plaques and animal bones, all offerings to a heroized mortal or a hero, probably the Messenian Aristomenes. Near the pit there was a channel for liquid offerings that ended in a pipe (Fig. 89). The track of the stadium was completely uncovered and it was confirmed that in the later years of R rule, the field had been transformed into an arena for wild animal fights, and that only the section with stone seats was used (Fig. 90).

A dedicatory inscription of the 1St Ct BC was found on the front of the thin fagade of slabs that line the lower diazoma. It mentions one Thiotas, who the excavator thinks is to be identified with the man who dedicated the statue of the daughter of Timaretas to Artemis (SEG 23, 221). A com- plete list of the Ephebes of 60 AD was found in the fill over the track. They are listed by tribe, the five old tribes of Messene. It also records foreigners and even freedmen. Also found were the body of a funerary sphinx, modelled on Attic examples, and a marble head of Polydeukion, the beloved pupil of Herodes Atticus, combining idealising classicising features with those of portraiture. Damaged as it is, the high quality of craftsmanship is clear. Behind (i.e. W of) the W stoa of the gymnasium is a group of fine funerary monuments. In K3, a pit-like tomb of a woman of the 2nd or 1St Ct BC was investigated. Grave- goods included many glass unguentaria and a glass plate with red glass handles. The restoration of this architecturally strange building has already begun, while excavations in the vicinity proceed with the investigation of a monument con- taining ten cist-graves. The excavator believes that a funeral stele found in 1998 may belong to the latter. Excavations also continued in the fine 3rd or 4th-Ct AD villa, where the important Ariadne and Dionysos mosaic was conserved (Fig. 91). The depiction of an acolyte kissing the god's hand is thought by the excavator to be a reaction against the spread of Christianity. It is thought that the villa was the site of the shrine to Cybele, whose statue had been sculpted by Damophon (Paus. IV.31,6). (Ergon 2000, 58-70) Methone.

The 2000 season was funded primarily by a grant received from the Institute for Aegean Prehistory. Wooden con- tainers were manufactured and all ceramic finds from Blegen's excavations that remain in cardboard cartons in the Museum of Hora will be transferred to these in 2001. Under the super- vision of Hariklia Brekoulaki of ASCSA, custom-built storage cabinets were installed to house the fragmentary frescoes. Analysis of the human skeletal material from the palace of Nestor and associated chamber and tholos tombs continued under the supervision of Lynne Schepartz of the University of Cincinnati. Study of Tsakalis tombs E3, E4 and E9 was com- pleted. E3 contained remains of a young adult male and a young adult female. E4 contained fragments of a young child's skull (4-6 yrs) and portions of an adult male. E9 consisted of a pri- mary burial of a young adult female, another fairly complete 91. Messene: mosaic of Ariadne and Dionysos</page><page sequence="50">50 DAVID BLACKMAN young adult female mixed with the dental remains of a child (2-4 yrs), and three adults; at least one of the adults was a male. Pits in E9 contained a minimum of three adults: at least one was a fairly young male and one was a female. Analysis of tomb E6 is in progress, but it seems to contain at least 12 children and adults. There is no indication of the cause of death of any indi- viduals studied thus far. Many, especially the females, have numerous caries and premortem tooth losses. Dental hypopla- sia, a sign of childhood disease or dietary stress, is commonly seen on both males and females. One of the male tibias from E9 has osteomyelitis, an inflammation and infection of the bone surface. Individuals from tombs were mostly young adults. Final analysis of faunal remains from the palace of Nestor began under the direction of Paul Halstead of Sheffield University with assistance of Valasia Isaakidou. Preliminary results have yielded evidence for the ritual sacrifice of cattle. One significant deposit of burnt thigh bones comes from the annex to the archive room of the palace. Finally, Peter Kuniholm of Corell University examined wood from the palace of Nestor, stored at present in the second storeroom of the Hora Museum. Most is either Pinus brutia or Pinus halepensis, but two other samples of timbers are potentially useful for dendrochronological analysis. In addition to the work of HARP, publication of the results of the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP) con- tinues. Newly published articles include: John Bennet, Jack Davis, and Fariba Zarinebaf, 'PRAP III: Sir William Gell's Itinerary in the Pylia and Regional Landscapes in the Morea in the Second Ottoman Period,' Hesperia 71, 343-80 and Wayne Lee, 'PRAP IV: The Early Modem Economy and the Village of Margeli,' to be published in Hesperia 72:1. Work on the restoration of Neokastro continued; it contains the Centre of Maritime Archaeological Research, which together with the Methone Archaeological Park is the respon- sibility of the EMA. (Epyov YIIHO 2, 152-3; 3, 168-9) KERKYRA AND THESPROTIA Kerkyra Kanoni (anc. Kerkyra). During excavation of two plots in the area of the anc. city in 1998, a R marble statue of Artemis, with- out the head, was found in a destruction layer. More plots were investigated in 1999, yielding further remains of the anc city. Anc. cemetery (Garitsa). A stone funerary peribolos, important for the location of the anc. city walls, was discov- ered in the area in 1998. In 1999, 63 tombs were identified in the Tourouki plot - tile-roofed graves, cist graves, pit graves, ash urns and cremations - and six pyres for offering to the dead. In 1999, in the Anemomylos area, excavation was contin- ued in the Arion plot, in order to acquire a more complete pic- ture of the remains of the port installations and associated structures of the anc city, thus revealing two further buildings. In the same area, another five rescue excavations revealed the substratum of an anc. road leading to the Hyllaic port, clay pipes, a filled-in well and sections of public and private build- ings dating to C and HL times. (Epyov Y1I7I02, 92; 3, 101-2) Kerkyra town. Palaiopole. The systematic excavation of the Kokotou, Kasphike and Kateche plots, which had been taking place in collaboration with Prof. T. Hackens from the University of Louvain la Neuve and Prof. R. Winkens from Brown University, continued for a seventh year in 1995. The E area of the Kokotou plot was cleaned, and excavation continued to the N. Important finds from the E area include part of a head from a LA hollow terracotta female figurine, fragments of HL clay figurines, fragments of glass vessels, marble slabs, bone tools, a bronze talisman and a tile bearing the inscription [EIII AZKAH]/InIOAQ[POY]. A further part of the stone pavement of the R agora was uncovered in the same plot, consisting of unevenly sized slabs, their surface smoothed with use, while two walls were found above this. Another part of the R agora pavement was revealed in the SE area of the Kateche plot, laid on a make-up of mor- tar and stone chips; a large part of this pavement was destroyed in the past by illegal building. The uncovering of the pavement to the SE was completed this season. A series of four column drums and a part of their base were located in the W area of the Kateche plot; they were of porous limestone, with an external coating of white lime mortar. Three of the column drums were found connected. Another base was discovered 13m NE of the column drums, with decoration on its sides, which indicates a different use of this base (as an architectural element) in an earlier phase. The N and E walls of the building (a stoa) were found in contact with the base. HL, R and LR finds were associated with the remains, including a 2nd-Ct BC rg lamp, decorated with a rosette and dots. The recovery of a series of large slab-like limestone blocks, forming a curvilinear structure, was continued in the centre of the plot. Another part of the paved floor was also exposed. R and LR pottery, including a small 4th-6th Ct AD glass vessel, as well as fragments of reddish lime mortar were found in the area. Investigation took place in the S, E and W of the Kasphike plot. In the S sector, a square-shaped room was discovered, built of opus caementicium, and with part of an opus testaceum floor of clay slabs preserved in one corer. The entrance to the room is on the NW, where the threshold has been preserved along with square and circular sockets for the door. Finds from this area date to the LR, HL and C periods, and include a LR clay figurine and PCor pyxis. A small paved road with an E-W alignment was found outside the room. A well was found SW of the room, with a paved area around it, both dating to the HL period. A series of rectangular stone courses was placed around this in R times, when it is thought that the well was supplying the R baths In the SW of the plot and S of area XXI, a double ellipsoid structure of unworked stone, tile and mortar was found. A large amount of pottery was also recovered from this area, which confirms its use from LR times back to HL and C; this includes a 4th5th Ct AD lamp depicting a wild goat with geometric and vegetal decorations. A sherd with a bf war scene is the only indication of use of this area in A times. Part of a floor was discovered in area XXII, NE of the plot and E of room V. It has a substratum of lime mortar, and is con- structed with black and white pebbles in the opus barbaricum style, which forms a herring bone in the opus spicatum style, which was used towards the end of the Imperial period. Finds in this area include a small skyphos with a red coating and the depiction of a hare in relief, plates of sigillata type and a R copy of a female marble statue. The N-S drainage pipe in area XXIV, built of two side walls and a floor of a series of concave tiles, is fragmentarily preserved and is possibly associated with the R baths. Finds of interest are a LR lamp with herringbone and rosette deco- ration and a HL clay figurine of Aphrodite. The partly- excavated area XXV, the stratigraphy of which has been dis- turbed, revealed structural remains as well as LR and HL finds. Some C finds from this area indicate the possible presence of earlier layers. In the W section of the plot, excavation took place in areas XIX, XVII and SW of the baths and along their W side.

Kerkyra: coin hoard XIX yielded HL, R and ECh sherds, as well as a destruction level of roughly cut blocks and ashlar blocks. Domestic pot- tery, bg sherds and HL coins were found below the destruction level, while in the SE comer of the area a C or A wall was iden- tified. A semi-circular structure, possible a hearth, was found in area XVII. Structural remains and a drainage pipe were found outside the baths to the SW; only the latter seems to have been associated with the baths. The finds from here include domestic pottery and African ware sherds. The presence of a furnace is indicated along the W side of the baths. Throughout the excavated area, finds include HL, R and LR pottery, mainly bg and undecorated, o ' -.: pottery of secular use, kantharoi, skyphoi, plates, ', "- lamps, African plates and amphoras, etc.; A and C finds were also identified. Furthermore, many coins were found, dating to the HL, R and LR peri- ods, most of them belonging to the Kerkyra types (400-300 BC, 300-229 BC, 229-48 BC and 48 . BC-138 AD). Four bronze coins, one Theodosian, one Constantinian, a coin from Dyrrachium . ) (3rd-Ist Ct BC) and a coin of Leukas (4th Ct BC), . were also found on the Kasphike plot. However, 0 the most important find of the season was the dis- ®' covery of a hoard of 508 silver drachmae from Corinth and Kerkyra dating to late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC (Fig. 92). (ADelt 431-5) Remains of seven small, carelessly built walls and a water supply shaft were found in the W part of the Maze-Montsenigou-Rigga plot, though it has not been easy to date them. Five of the walls appear to be defining a building, the floor sub- stratum of which has been identified. The finds include ten bronze coins and one silver, which cover a chronological period of 450-400 BC to the 6th Ct AD. Pottery was also found, mainly un- decorated and of secular use, belonging to the A and C periods. (ADelt 438) In the Mikalef plot, excavation was continued for the 12th year (Fig. 93). Work on the area of the mould deposit was completed: it extends N-S between walls T18 and T27, and E-W between furnaces 11 and 10. Between these two furnaces a thick layer of burnt material was found, and it was established that the base of the mould deposit was an old furnace floor that had been destroyed. The 93. Kerky finds from the deposit include fragments of LA figurines of the known Kerkyrean types, mould fragments, A and C pottery and various wasters from the workshop. Walls were discovered N of the mould deposit, as well as a pottery fill (A to PCh). There was also evidence of pyres in irregular pits, which contained masses of metal. The main finds in this area were A to HL figurine fragments, wasters from clay vessels, amphora handles and lids, a miniature jug containing a few bones and a fragment of a bronze ring. A wall and a pyre were found to the W of the mould deposit. Finds included LA and C fragments of figurines and figurine moulds and a miniature pelike containing pigment traces, which had been used by the potter for his pottery. A pottery fill was locat- ed in the same area, containing wasters and unbaked clay from the nearby kiln. Important finds from the same area also include a glass'bead, lamp and figurine fragments and A and C pottery. Two new kilns, of the two-storey circular type, were locat- ed S of wall T20. In the centre of the floor were marks left by the small pillar that supported the furnace grate. In the NW area of the plot three more walls were recov- ered, similar in technique to others excavated previously. They date to the last three centuries of the ECh period. Layers of unbaked clay were located N of wall T30, and must be associ- ated with neighbouring furnace 9. Finds from this area consist of A to st-Ct BC pottery and coins dating from the late 4th Ct to 1St Ct BC. Pottery and coins were also found dating to the ra: Mikalef plot</page><page sequence="52">52 DAVID BLACKMAN 94. Kerkyra: Mikalef plot: figurine mould three last centuries of the ECh period. It is important to note, however, that this part of the plot had been used to deposit the excavation spoil heaps, and as a rubbish dump by the modem owners. Of interest amongst the finds are a stone plate depict- ing a small temple, which is probably associated with worship in the workshop area, a mould of an oval plate depicting a young man holding a horse by the reigns, a mould of a female bust (Fig. 94), a figurine fragment of a leaning figure, possibly Herakles, a decorated bronze trident and a bf sherd depicting a warrior helmet. A total of 102 bronze coins were found in the plot dating from the 4th Ct BC to Venetian times. (ADelt 435-7) The Pamphile plot, previously known as the Evelpide plot, was originally excavated by the owner in the years 1960-84. This earlier excavation revealed three HL houses, parts of two paved streets of the anc. town, a copper crucible, the possible presence of an A temple and 7th-6th Ct BC walls and pottery. No C architectural remains were identified, possi- bly due to the Peloponnesian war. A new excavation took place in 1995, when the continuation of a wall (KK') was found, and its use from A to HL times was established. A thick layer of 5th- Ct BC pottery was found in the W area of the new excavation, which also included many A and PCor sherds (e.g. fragment of a PCor skyphos, a Cor trefoil-mouthed jug, a PCor pyxis base and lamps). Most finds, however, belong to the HL and later periods, as do the architectural remains. These finds include many heads of HL figurines, animal figurines, body fragments of female clay figurines of the standing Artemis type, HL pot- tery and a substantial number of coins from Kerkyra, of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC. (ADelt 437-8) A rescue excavation in the Papoule plot revealed a care- lessly built wall, of partly dressed slab-like limestone blocks of small and medium size. In the S of the plot, a single course of the same material was recovered, bonded with white mortar and tile. The only pottery found were undecorated sherds from domestic vessels. (ADelt 438-9) A rescue excavation in the G. Tzeliou plot revealed two walls of undressed stone blocks, tile and soil, a layer of fallen tiles and a possible floor. Finds included three coins (one of Kephallenia pre-431 BC, one of Dyrrachium of 250-229 BC), undecorated coarseware, sherds of decorated fineware and loom-weights. Investigation of church property in Nausikas street in Figareto revealed a possible retaining wall, a female figurine fragment, bg sherds and a rf krater fragment depicting the right hand of a woman holding a trefoil-mouthed jug. Further inves- tigation of the adjoining areas is planned for the future. (ADelt 439-40) In 1998, eight rescue excavations were carried out within the mod. city of Kerkyra and over the rest of the island (Moraitika, Ermones, Karousades). At Ai-Drias in the S of the island, part of a settlement was found and there were indications of workshop installations of the HL period, while at Karousades in N Kerkyra a HL dump was located. Surface survey in S Kerkyra in 1999 led to the identification of previously unknown sites. (Epyov YTIHO, 2, 92-3; 3,101-2) Thesprotia Work carried out in the framework of the construction of Egnatia Odos in 1998 brought to light approx. 30,000 stone tools in the area of Eleutherochori and the adjoining basin, dating mainly to the MPal period. An excavation 2 km away from the basin revealed another 20,000 stone tools. In the area of Mesovouni hundreds of similar tools were also collected. Tombs with poor grave goods were found in the area of Graikochori. Work continued in 1999, revealing a building and four graves of LR times at the Igoumenitsa road junction, and more MPal and UPal stone tools in Mesovouni, Grika, Neochori, Eleutherochori and the Igoumenitsa-Ioannina road. (Epyov YHH702, 94; 3, 102-3) In 1998, the construction of a water-supply system at Paramythia resulted in the discovery of a HL building. The excavation of a polygonal building also started at Pyrgi Eleytheriou, which continued the following year, bringing to light HL and R tombs, and three pottery kilns of later date. A small building and 176 cist graves with few or no grave goods were located and excavated at Astimitsi in Korytiane. Other sites were also identified across Thesprotia, which will be stud- ied and dated in the future. (Epyov YHH702, 94; 3, 103) Geroplatanos-Fanote. The investigation of a walled settle- ment at Chora, which took place after an illegal excavation, involved the excavation of building A and revealed another three buildings. The site has previously been identified with the anc. city of Fanote, though this has not been confirmed. The site is located on a hill and preserves two periboloi with tow- ers (possibly 3rd-Ct BC fortifications). There are extensive building remains, particularly on the acropolis, where later R and Turkish interventions have been noted. A few cist graves, mostly looted, have been found on the opposite hill, though the surrounding area has not been really explored. Most of building A was excavated, though its extent was not established and the bedrock was not reached. As a result the function of the building has not been confirmed, though it appears to be a large house. There seems to be an annex, which was probably added later S of the building. The most thor- oughly investigated area (bl) had three entrances, though its function has not been clarified. A 1m wide corridor between buildings A and D is thought to be a drain. Turkish, R and HL finds have been found in a disturbed layer. Below this, a bro- ken up layer of R and HL material indicates the creation of fills</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 53 95. Gitane: building E in R times, during the re-use of the building, possibly before the end of the 1St Ct BC. A destruction level of tiles is often found below this level. Another level below these appears to be intact, indicating that not all the area was filled in during the R period; it dates to HL times, on the basis of coins recovered (Epirot League, 233-167 BC). It is therefore possible that the destruction level dates to the known R destructions in 167 BC. Finds of interest from the disturbed layer include a silver Turkish coin, half a bronze coin of Hadrian (117-138 AD), a fragment of a tile with stamp (0), a fragment of a glass vessel with a ten-rayed stamped star on its base, fragments of clay fig- urines, etc., while an almost intact undecorated trefoil-mouthed jug was found in the HL layer. (ADelt 442-4) Gitane. Building E. A structure was found to the W of the Gitane stoa, built in the polygonal style and consisting of two contemporary buildings (Fig. 95). The W building, consisting of three rooms, seems to have been used as a storehouse, based on the discovery of over 500 items, including kantharoi, plates, lamps, amphoras, trefoil-mouthed jugs, bronze votive feet (human and animal), as well as jewellery. Of particular interest are a bg plate with a bust of Athena and part of a pyxis lid with scenes in relief of cupids, Pan with a pipe and a satyr with a flute. Many of the finds seem to be of votive character. The E building consists of two rooms, one of which was added later and extends beyond the stoa. The base of a staircase inside this room, leading to the upper floor, as well as the threshold and right pilaster of its monumental entrance have been preserved. There seems to be no communication, neither between the E and W buildings, nor between the rooms of the W building itself, which suggests possible access via stairs from the first floor. An incomplete decorated base, consisting of a dressed stone and a cylindrical architectural element on top, was found to the right of the monumental entrance. Two fragments of a manumission decree were found within the building. These finds, along with the location of the building in the agora, in the centre of town, lead to the possible identification of the building as a place of worship for Apollo Aigyieus. (ADelt 440) The HL cemetery of Gitane is located on the NW side of the city walls, outside the N gate to the city, and extends for ca 2 km along a road. Immediately outside the city walls, three partly looted funerary monuments were investigated. They consist of a central cist grave built of single limestone slabs and cover slabs (now broken) and are surrounded by a pear- shaped or an externally square and internally octagonal peribo- los; these periboloi imitate temple-shaped buildings and bear sculpted decoration. The orientation of the tombs varies (Fig. 96). The first tomb has a floor of variously shaped limestone slabs. A few human skeletal remains, fragments of a marble temple-shaped ossuary and a lamp were found in the soil that had fallen into the tomb after looting. The foundations and sub- structure of a H-shaped structure connected to the tomb were revealed on the W side, forming the funerary monument. Finds from the H-shaped area consist of HL pottery, including a skyphos fragment decorated with a satyr or a comedy mask, whereas metal and bronze small finds and fragments of female clay figurines were collected from the funerary monument. Small parts of architectural elements decorated with cymatia and part of a Doric capital were found W of the monument. The second tomb has evidence of a structure to the W, sim- ilar to that of the first tomb. The rear part of a skull and skele- tal remains were found within the tomb. The grave goods con- sisted of 11 perfume vases (late 3rcmid 2nd Ct BC), three 3rd- Ct BC lamps, a plate and a jar fragment. The rear part of a smaller skull was found E of the first skull, and near this, five bronze coins (ca 342 BC) and bronze and metal rivets.</page><page sequence="54">54 DAVID BLACKMAN 97. Ladochori: Roman building The third tomb is located within a monument constructed of masonry and a type of paved walkway extends from the W side. A kantharos, fragments of a bg perfume vase, fragments of double cylindrical handles and part of a marble ossuary were found within the monument, whereas a bronze coin dating to 238-168 BC was found outside it, though it is not thought to be associated with the tomb. (ADelt 440-2) Kallithea. A cist grave was found W of the school. (ADelt 447) Ladochori. The Roman road connecting Dyrrachion to Nikopolis, via Apollonia, Aulon, Orikon, Bouthroton, Masklenitsa and Ladochori, is located in this area. Parts of a R building, with at least three phases of habitation, were located in the Dritsou plot, during the digging of foundations. Evidence of HL habitation has also been established in the same area. The building consists of five rooms in the first phase, which dates to the 2nd Ct BC- st Ct AD (Fig. 97). The walls are built of alternating uncut blocks and masonry, bound with lime mortar. One of the rooms has been identified as a kitchen based on the cooking ware found, and another as a cubiculum. The second phase dates to the lst-3rd Cts AD, and is marked by the creation of an atrium to the E of the building. This has a mosaic floor, consisting of two continuous panels, the first of which consists of inscribed crosses and circles, and the second of birds and fish within octagons. These two main themes are separated by a vertical long and thin red band, and are surrounded externally by a band of ivy leaves and spiral stems. The mosaic consists of red, black and white tessarae. Finds from within the atrium include lamps, ladles, cooking pots and plates dating to the st-3rd Cts AD. Finds from other rooms include everyday pottery, cooking ware, trefoil- mouthed jugs, skyphoi, and amphoras, two bronze coins, one with the bust of emperor Elagabalus (219-220 AD), and the other with the bust of the Cilician empress Orbiana. In the third phase (4th-6th Cts AD), the building sees mod- ifications and repairs, including the destruction of the S part of the mosaic floor by the construction of a new wall. Finds include amphoras, skyphoi, plates, pottery with combed fluted decoration, 6th-Ct glass goblets, part of a marble drinking foun- tain and bronze coins, one of which bears the bust of Anastasius. In the middle of the plot is a paved road leading from the complex to the coast. More structures are located N of this, where finds included small skyphoi, amphoras, ladles, cooking pots and coins. Area IX, which has a paved floor on which lay a marble fluted col- umn, was probably used as a water tank. Drains were found associated with this area. A hearth was found E of area XII, along with a clay sealing with an incised cross. A 2nd-Ct AD R cemetery and several contem- " -'^ l&gt; porary tombs, along with a building, and a com- plex of three phases (early 2nd Ct BC-early 6th Ct AD), had also been found previously in the area. (ADelt 445-6) Extensive building in the area the years 1993-8 has resulted in the discovery of an extensive LR and ECh settlement in the innermost part of Igoumenitsa Bay, including settlement walls, a fairly well preserved mosaic floor decorated with ' - geometric designs in the central area of a building and a small bath, possibly belonging to the last phase of the settlement. In 1999 more areas of the settlement were revealed, including paved roads, squares, a bath complex and part of the anc. beach. Part of the R necropolis was also discovered with a total of 27 roof-tiled graves and cist graves located so far, containing rich grave goods. (Epyov Y770 2, 93-4; 3, 102) Lista. Roof tile fragments were discovered in the Th. Photiou, I. Photiou and Sp. Skarone plot, at Pege Kefalovrysos, during a rescue excavation. Further investigation revealed part of a R/LR building, set on the bedrock. Five walls were discovered, built of two connected oblong rows of variously sized stone blocks, sometimes partly worked. Binding material varies between soil, mud and lime mortar, and the fills consist of small stones or stone flakes. Finds from the investigated area consist of fragments of roof and floor tiles, sherds from large poorly baked coarsewares, as well as sherds from small vessels of secular use, with horizontal streaks of red clay in relief. (ADelt 444) Neochori-Grika. During the construction of the Egnatia Odos, the area between Neochori and Grika was investigated. Antiquities confirming human activity between the EBA and LR times were identified on the E side of Kokorina Hill, SW of lake Limnopoula/Chotkova, near the plain of Grika- Neochori and Chrystallopege. The LBA is represented by two pit graves. The first con- tained a skeleton on its back, with skeletal remains of a horse at its side and grave goods such as a clay bead, a gold bead, and a black burnished bottle-shaped pot with a handle. The second contained disturbed skeletal material and a bronze spearhead. Finds from the area include mainly sherds from BA handmade pottery with rope-like decoration in relief and single colour burnish. They are mainly bottle-shaped and wide-mouthed ves- sels, cups with handles and a high-footed kylix. Two unused silver staters from Kerkyra, dating to the late 6th Ct BC, were also identified. Despite the presence of a 4th-Ct BC bg trefoil-mouthed jug, bg lamp and plate, no architectural remains have been found. The area was used as a cemetery in the R period, and two tile-roofed graves have been found, both with grave goods (a trefoil-mouthed jug in one and a bg lamp and a jug in the other). A contemporary building was found in the area, and another six pit graves with no grave-goods were identified around the building, possibly dating to the HL period. LR sherds were also found scattered across the area. (ADelt 446-7)</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 55 Paxoi. A surface survey was carried out on the island, leading to the location of three sites. The foundations of a building and remains of one of its walls were identified on top of a hilly area at Agios Panteleemonas Ozias. The wall is built of ashlar masonry and parts of it were found scattered around the site, along with sherds from pottery of secular use, made of red clay. A rectangular building of pseudo-isodomic masonry was found at Agios Isavros Alexes, Magazia. Its entrance is on the W, and the foundations of another rectangular structure are visible within it. Glazed sherds were found during trial trenching in a neighbouring field. A HL pit grave, covered by stone slabs, was identified at Agios Spyridonas Lankadia, Magazia. In the grave was a skeleton on its back, hands at its sides. A silver Cor drachma (obv: Pegasus galloping right; rev: the nymph Peirene) was found below the skull, dating to the late 4th/early 3rd Cts BC, whereas a bronze double fibula was located near the left hand and a clay jug near the left foot. (ADelt 447-8) Kibotos Geromachos. A building with walls built of pseu- do-isodomic masonry (fragmentarily preserved) was found in an upland area with a view over the coastal area of Kake Langada. No sherds were found in trial trenching in the area. (ADelt 448) Sterna Ellenike. Cuttings for the setting of walls can be seen in the rock at the top of the promontory overlooking the natural harbour of Bougazi. According to Salvatore there used to be an anc. water tank at that location, which was replaced with the existing one during the British occupation. (ADelt 448) Panagia Velliane Islet. The island is strewn with flint tools. (ADelt 448) Photike. During a surface survey, five walls and a rectangular altar were found in the A. and K. Cheimona plot. One of the walls is R, built of stone and ashlar blocks and bound with mortar (opus caementicium). The altar was found W of this and had fallen. It is probably R, built of white limestone and deco- rated with bands, streaks and tresses. On its front it bears a bucranium, on its right side a trefoil-mouthed jug and on its left side a concave circular disk (Fig. 98). (ADelt 447) Sagiada. Twenty recently looted cist graves were investigated in the anc. cemetery extending along the NE slope of Mastilitsa hill. The few grave goods recovered date the tombs to the LC and EHL periods. A small excavation at Kastri, where part of a polygonal wall was visible, brought to light several artefacts, including pottery and coins dating from LC to at least late antiquity. Parts of walls and tile-roofed graves of a previously unknown anc. settlement were identified on the coast of Sagiada. (Epyov YHHO 2, 94) Sagiada Bay. Extensive LR remains were investigated by the EMA in 1998. (Epyov YnHO 2, 152) BOIOTIA Akraiphnion. At the site of Grava, on the N side of the national road from Athens to Lamia, an extensive part of the cemetery of anc. Akraiphia was excavated, as well as part of a LR building. The excavations in the cemetery unearthed a group of 226 tombs (165 inhumations, 61 cremations) oriented N-S, which continued under the mod. road. The tombs ranged from the LG to the LR period, although the majority dated from the 6th to the 2nd Cts BC, the most intensive period of use of the cemetery. The burials were scattered all over the area, in random concentrations, and the majority contained funeral gifts. No funerary stelae were identified. The cemetery was 98. Photike: limestone altar characterized by a typological variety in tomb types, the adult burials including 61 cremation pyres and 69 inhumations, with a marked preference for the former, especially after the C and E HL periods. Of the inhumations, the most popular type of tomb was the tile-roofed, and then follow the cist-tombs and the simple pits. For child burials, inhumations alone were attested, the earliest specimen dating from the 7th/early 6th Ct BC. The child burials comprised 42.5% of the total number of burials, and consisted mostly of tile-roofed graves, pits (7th Ct BC onward), stone cist-tombs (7th-6th Cts BC), pits with stone cover slabs (6th Ct BC), and small clay lamakes (5th Ct BC). The funeral gifts were placed both inside the tomb, by the head or the feet of the dead, and outside. As regards the cremations of adults, the dead were cremated on a wooden bier. To the NE of this site, test trenches revealed the existence of two more groups of tombs, of mostly A date. To the NW of the cemetery were located the remains of a R building, containing eight rooms. The large room at the NW side of the building was the only room to have a sloping floor, laid with small bricks, the whole set into a layer of hard plas- ter (opus pseudospicatum). By one of the walls was discovered a stone oil-press, while the oil was apparently collected in a nearby square collection pit, lined with bricks and waterproof plaster. For the storage of oil a pithos was probably used, the lowest part of which was found in situ in the same room, in fact the largest room in the house, apparently used as a storage area. Inside the pithos was discovered a sesterce of Faustina (AD 141-161). In a neighbouring room was recorded a millstone, while olive pits, loom-weights, agricultural digging tools, iron nails, sheets and rings, were found all over the building.

Aliartos: funerary peribolos most important find was a group of ca 70 coins, dating from the 1St to the 4th Cts AD, and a gold ring with a carelian, found inside a wall. The building, which preserved no signs of a vio- lent abandonment, was probably a farm with workshop activi- ties, or a public building, with workshop/commercial character. (ADelt 301-4) At a small distance from the village of Tsoukalades, on the right of the national road from Livadeia to Delphi, seven tile- roofed graves were recorded, part of a R cemetery, while 35 hut-shaped tombs and a rectangular cistern of Byz date were unearthed at the site of the Katrades factory, at the 69th km of the new national road from Athens to Thebes. (ADelt 304-5) Aliartos. In the area of the anc. cemeteries of Aliartos, N of the mod. road crossing the town, the excavation of a monu- mental funerary peribolos of the C period was completed, with the investigation of more graves, both inside and outside its limits. The peribolos had two construction phases: the first in the 5th Ct BC, when it formed a single unit, with an entrance facing the anc. road, and the second in the early 3rd Ct BC, when a dividing wall was erected, just inside and parallel to its facade (Fig. 99). Inside the peribolos were excavated four C (early 4th Ct BC) and seven HL tombs, the majority of the lat- ter being tile-roofed, hut-shaped graves. Tombs of similar type were discovered against the outside of the E wall of the peribo- los, and ca 20m to its N. Both the peribolos and the tombs around it were part of the extensive E cemetery of the anc. town. (ADelt 296-8) Daulose (Boiotikos Medeon). Rescue excavations at the site of the Myc chamber tomb cemetery, at Kalimbaki, involved the cleaning of two looted chamber tombs, with a well pre- served dromos and a lintel. Systematic investigation of the hill of Megalo Kastraki, already identified as the acropolis of anc. Medeon, yielded interesting results, especially in the undis- turbed NE section, where successive MH habitation phases and three cist tombs were identified, over the scanty remains of an EH settlement. The MH site was characterized by three build- ing phases, the earliest of which included an apsidal building, while the two later phases included two or three rectangular structures. In the disturbed area, at the top of the hill, EH II and MH pottery were recorded, but no architectural remains. The Myc acropolis was probably located on Kalimbaki hill, near the chamber tomb cemetery. (ADelt 299-301) Delesi. At the OTE plot, architectural remains of commercial and workshop character were excavated, dating from the R period. (ADelt 305) Libadeia. The architectural remains of houses, public build- ings and tombs, at the site of the new hospital, as well as pot- tery and small finds, all document the position and importance of the anc. town, dating mostly from the post-C periods of antiquity. (ADelt 301) Agia Triada. Cave of the Nymph of Koroneia. V. Vasilopoulou reports that the EPS continued excavation in 1995; much damage had been caused by continuing illegal excavations. Deposits proved to be 8m deep, with deep layers of water-borne sediment. Work was confined to section I near the cave mouth; a PR level was found with Minyan and Myc sherds and burnt layers, and in one corner large N sherds; a limited deep test trench revealed two underlying burnt levels with FN/early EB pottery and a few broken obsidian blades and animal bones; the burnt levels were separated by deposits of water-borne mud. The lack of stratified material and small amount of pottery found so far make conclusions tentative about PR occupation, but they indicate seasonal rather than permanent occupation of the cave. It is hoped that when more stratified bone, lithic and organ- ic material evidence is available it will shed light on the link of this cave, close to good water sources but far from agricultural land, with the development of stock-raising, particularly sheep and goats, in Central and S Greece at the turn of the N and EB periods; also on the probable link of the cave with a (very prob- ably) EHII-III site on a plateau within the village of Agia Triada. Important also were finds of the historical period, notably a board-like figurine with a semi-circular incised inscription to Aeit3eo(Optai6t fIh)ia, and sherds (mainly of skyphoi) inscribed Aetp3r0pi6e; vu'Cpe; (530-500 BC) (Fig. 100), confirming yet again the identification of the cave as that mentioned by Pausanias and Strabo; also a figurine of Aphrodite of a Boeotian workshop (late 5th Ct: Fig. 101) and a female figure in front of a temple in relief (Fig. 102). A large number of figures have been found, including new types, dat- ing from the A to LHL periods; unfortunately the stratigraphy of the levels of the historical period has also been destroyed by the frequent illegal excavation in the cave. (ADelt 832-4). In 1998 the cave was restored as part of a youth volunteer pro- gramme; excavation continued in 1999. (Epyov YHHO 2, 155; 3, 171) National Highway, Athens-Lamia, 69.2 km. Byz burials and small finds were reported dating to the 1lth-12th Cts in association with a two-room rectangular structure. (ADelt 85) Orchomenos K. Fittschen (DAI) reports on the survey work carried out under his direction. The project, initiated in the two seasons of 1997 and 1998, was thus brought to a close. 'The following work was carried out in 2000: Mycenaean tholos: detailed measurement revealed that the tholos vault was steeper and possibly also somewhat high- er than that of the only slightly larger 'Treasury of Atreus' at Mycenae. It can be inferred from the contours of the terrain that the upper part of the tholos projected about 8m above the surface of the ground.</page><page sequence="57">Leibadia, Agia Triada: finds from the Cave of the Nymph of Koroneia 100. Inscribed potsherd The n-shaped base in the interior shows mouldings (kyma- tia) of LC style, but letters on the base blocks (A-X, visible in those places where the orthostat blocks are missing) suggest that the base was erected only in R Imperial times (the shape of the H is, in this form, not attested before the 1st Ct AD). No traces of secondary use can be discerned in the clamp-holes and dowel-holes of the base. To date, the finds made by Schliemann when he uncovered the tholos in 1880/1 and 1886 (remains of sculptures, statue base, table leg) have not been recovered and appear to be lost. The fragmentary inscription discovered by A. Orlandos during his restoration of the tholos is kept in the Museum of Chaironeia; it supports the assumption that in the R Imperial period the tholos was dedicated to the Imperial cult. E wall: only scarce remains are preserved of the E wall, but on the basis of individual stones visible on the surface it was possible to reconstruct its original course. During the investigation by H. Bulle in 1903/5, remains of a gate were observed in the vicinity of the mod. Church of Ag. Charalambos. A part of this structure, the end of the W wall, is preserved S of the mod. road, and was rediscovered under recent rubbish. The gate itself would have stood in the location of the mod. road and can be presumed to have been destroyed when the road was built. The wall runs N of the road, to the NE at first, ending in the NE tower, of which individual foundation blocks are preserved. Here, W. Leake's map of 1805 erroneously assumed a gate. At this tower, the wall curved around to the NW and merged into the N wall above the area of the source of the Melas. On this part of the wall, a further tower is located (N tower), of which Bulle was able to make out more than is visible today. Diateichisma: At the W edge of the town woods, the remains of a wall are preserved which run from the N to the S wall and may thus be called a diateichisma. In the central part of this wall is a huge, W-facing tower, the visible remains of which were drawn. N and S of the tower, parts of the curtain walls are preserved, but their connection with the tower is not known. In the area S of the tower, some stones can be dis- ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 57 101. Figurine of Aphrodite I * -! ll~: 102.

W protective wall. The castle on the summit (kastro) was protected against attacks in three ways. Immediately in front of the W side of the castle, the saddle was deepened so as virtual- ly to form a ditch. W of this was erected a wall of field stones, which had already been surveyed in 1997. As can be deduced from a large number of tiles, this wall appears to have been reinforced by a tower. About 500m farther to the W, i.e. still on the far side of the quarries, a further wall of field stones is to be found; this was only discovered in 1999. In the course of measuring the wall this year, it was established that it runs across the whole of Mt Akontion from S to N. In its southern section, on higher ground, it is still up to 2m high (Fig. 103); in the lower N section it is much less well preserved, but here, too, its course can be made out. The date of this wall is unknown, but it seems likely that it was erected during the wars between Mithridates and Sulla (86 BC), since it protects Orchomenos against attacks from the direction of Chaironeia and Abai. 103.

Plataiai: acropolis Inside this wall, the remains of a small round tower (diam. 3m) are preserved, with walls of fine curvilinear polygonal (Lesbian-style) masonry. It probably dates from the late 6th or early 5th Ct and belonged to a signalling system. (The acropo- lis of Abai and the later tower of Askri are visible from here.) On this tower, the pillar for a trigonometric point was erected sometime before 1971.' Plataiai. V. Aravantinos, A. Konecny and R. Marchese report on the 2000 campaign: 'During summer 2000 the Greek-Austrian excavations continued, this year with the participation of the University of Minnesota at Duluth. Activities comprised excavations at the W gateway, trial trenches at the acropolis, and geophysical prospection. At the W gateway a sondage was dug into the house adjoining the gateway area towards the E, but results were not very promising and every trace of any floor has obviously been destroyed by ploughing. Nevertheless, the fill below contained huge quantities of ceramics, mostly miniature vessels, dating to the first half of the 4th Ct BC. Another sondage, located on top of the rear wall of the gateway's inner courtyard, revealed the foundation for the N door jamb of the thoroughfare which leads from the courtyard onto the main road across town. Three superimposed layers of floors were associated with the wall. The lower one is secure- ly connected to the construction of the gateway, and contained ceramics, the latest of which date, according to preliminary studies, to the decades around 330 BC. Thus it now seems rea- sonably justified to assume that the whole gateway, and togeth- er with it the huge enceinte of the town, were constructed in the course of the re-foundation and refurbishment of Plataiai after the battle of Chaeronea under the aegis of Philip II and his son, Alexander. The floor levels above are connected with later phases of restructuring of the gateway complex. At the SW fringes of the acropolis, just above the great spring, two trenches were opened to produce more precise evi- dence of the habitation sequence of Plataiai than could have been gained from survey data only (Fig. 104). In the S trench, directly beneath the surface, a thick layer of mixed material covered foundations of buildings which date approximately to the 5th to 7th Cts AD. Immediately below these walls were strata dating to the very end of the LA period, containing huge amounts of debris and covering some walls of earlier date. This massive packing probably has to be seen as a result of clearing work conducted after the sack of Plataiai by Persian troops in 480 BC. In the N trench, directly beneath the layer of Byz material, a sequence of strata of A date was retrieved. These date from the early 7th to the mid-6th Ct BC. A neat deposit of pottery contained a lot of mid and late A vessels of Cor and local origin. Immediately to the W, a substantial wall follows the hill crest. Ceramic material embedded into its surface course might indicate that it originates from the LBA. Besides this stratified material the trenches at the acropolis yielded pottery ranging in date from PR to MByz times. HL and R pottery occurred in rather small quantities. The layers accumulated during these times have obviously fallen victim to terracing conducted in connection with the construction of the Byz structure mentioned above. LH pottery retrieved includes the whole range from the beginning of the LH sequence until at least mid III C. Some of the pieces are of very fine quality, and even some early Myc Palace Style could be distinguished. MH consisted of quite substantial quantities of Grey Minyan pottery of surprisingly good quality. EH was abundant, in coarse as well as in finer ware. Finally, a few fragments of pot- tery could be assigned to the LN and, probably, the Chalcolithic period. Thus, an obviously continuous habitation sequence from the 4th millennium BC to Med times is now securely documented for Plataiai. Geophysical prospection, conducted by the Fitch Laboratory (BSA), once again paid a good dividend. At the S apex of the HL diateichisma the location of a rectangular tower, which had not been distinguishable on the surface, was pinpointed. Additionally, in the course of the NE part of the huge enceinte of LC date, the probable site and some hints about the structure of a major gateway were located. Remains in this sector of Plataiai have, however, suffered heavily from deep ploughing. Work is to continue in 2001.' Tachi (anc. Potniai). The continued excavations in the area revealed a further part of the extensive cemetery, with the investigation of 13 tombs and the discovery of another section of the rock-cut aqueduct, crossing the cemetery in a NW-SE direction. The funerary remains investigated included two LH IIIA pit-graves, a row of eight simple pits, a group of two LG pit-graves, covered by piles of stones, and a single cist-tomb, possibly also LG in date.

Thebes. In 1995, six rescue excavations were carried out in the mod. town of Thebes, of mostly PR interest. The extension towards the S of the excavations in Odos Pelopidou with the ultimate aim of defining the limits of the Myc Linear B archive, discovered in 1994 (AR 1999-2000, 58), has yielded interesting results (Fig. 105). Trench VII, to the N of trench VI, apart from the complete investigation of the apothetes, did not yield any more tablets, and few other finds. Trench VIII, to the S of trenches V and VI, revealed a stratigraphical sequence very similar to that encountered in the two other trenches: below the LH IIIC2 layers lay a LH IIIC1 floor surface, pre- served in the E part of the trench; under the latter was record- ed a small LH IIIA deposit, followed by a MH layer, which formed part of the well-known MH cemetery on the E side of Kadmeia. As regards the SMyc and PG periods, one cist-tomb and one pit-grave dated in the former period, or in the transi- tion to the latter, were located in the same trench. Surrounding the extensive MH cemetery in the area, which included at least ten tombs (pits, cists), and which was the W extension of the cemetery excavated at the Arsenal in 1963-4, was a thick layer of ashy grey earth, containing traces of carbonized wood, prob- ably scattered house debris. Of the surviving architectural remains of the Myc period (walls, hearths, floors), the majori- ty seem to date from the LH IIIC 1 period. During systematic cleaning operations in the area of the old excavations at the arsenal, inside a niche, and within a destruction layer (thickness 50cm) preserving strong traces of fire and consisting of roof-tiles, mud-bricks and white clay, a group of unique pieces of worked ivory was discovered, most- ly inlays for wooden furniture. The associated pottery can be dated to the LH IIIB period, which agrees with the date for the rest of the finds from the arsenal, and the recently discovered Linear B archive in Odos Pelopidou. The four most interesting pieces were: a relief ivory plaque, decorated with a central rosette, a unique piece; a plaque, decorated again in relief, with a hunting scene, including a chariot, a tree, hunters on foot, and a border bearing representations of hunting dogs and altars; a disc of ivory, pierced with six holes, which was probably from horse trappings (reins), of the type mentioned in the Linear B documents (Fig. 106); and finally, a small cut-out plaque, in the form of hybrid flower (lily/papyrus), carved in the round, and probably used in association with a wooden throne, or even to decorate the head of a horse. In another plot in Odos Pelopidou the stratigraphical sequence consisted of three levels: the first contained mixed pottery and portable finds of the R, HL-C and Myc periods, the second contained architectural remains and pottery of the LH period, and the third contained architectural remains and pot- tery of the EH period. Among the ten rooms and the multitude of architectural remains investigated, room 7, in the third level, yielded the remains of a rectangular mud-brick structure, probably strengthened by thin pieces of wood, and coated internally with white/grey clay, in three successive layers. The centre of the area was occupied by an ellipsoidal rock-cut bothros, coat- ed internally with red clay and also sealed with clay. It con- tained animal bones, ashes, fragments of household imple- ments and of obsidian, as well as EH III pottery (Ag. Marina style). In room 6, again in the third level, the SE part of an EH room/storeroom with mud-brick walls was preserved. Along the interior of these walls was a platform, with hollows of vary- ing diameter (30-65cm), probably for placing vases; the hol- 106.

Large fragments of a pithos, containing burnt cereal grains, were found on a destroyed platform in the same room. The room was destroyed by fire. In rooms 8 and 9, in the third level, were recorded scattered patches of grey or red clay, probably remains of floor surfaces, the latter associated with a circular hearth (55 x 45cm, h. 12cm), built of grey clay; its interior was full of black earth, with pieces of carbonized wood, burnt sherds of coarse pottery and a few animal bones. The hearth was associated with a I- shaped section of grey clay, in the interior of which were recorded three holes in a row. Over this structure, among stones, was discovered a naked female Cyc idol. In areas 12 and 10, in the first level, was discovered a dis- turbed Myc deposit, including a steatite sealstone (wild goat), LH IIIB/C pottery and a number of small finds, while the third level yielded at least two building phases, of the EH period (walls, circular hearth). In area 1, in the second level, traces were discovered of a white clay floor and of a circular hearth (di. 66cm), of mud- brick, overlying an earlier one; on the hearth, which dated from the LH IIIB/C period, was found part of a cooking pot (Fig. 107). Investigations within the courtyard of the archaeological museum, in view of the extension of the latter, and especially in the N part revealed, within a mud- brick deposit, which resembled a tumulus, MH cist-tombs and pit-graves, overlying building remains of the EH II period. At the junction of Odos L. Bellou and I. Threpsiadou successive occupation phases, dat- ing from the PR to the Byz period, were excavat- ed. The historical era was represented by mostly disturbed deposits, associated with pottery of R, HL-C, A and Myc date, as well as by fragmentary architectural remains (four walls) and two cist- tombs. Worth mentioning is a collection of female and animal clay idols, associated with the Thesmophorion in the square ofAg. Georgios. The Myc period was represented by architectural remains (walls) and deposits, including part of a building, in the interior of which was discovered a I destruction layer, with signs of an intense fire. Among the finds were lead sheets, with a series of holes on their perimeter, a seal of white stone, bearing a representation of a doe suckling her [ii : 3 young, two large plain vases (pithos and storage jar) in situ, and pottery of the LH IIIA2/IIIB1 108. Thet period. In another part of the plot was discovered part of a rec- tangular building, with two rooms forming a basement on the S. The eastermost room (1) was a corridor and yielded no finds, while in the other room (2) the floor was partly the native rock, and partly a layer of white/grey clay (Fig. 108, from the E). On the bedrock was recorded a circular clay construction (di. 50cm), preserving very few traces of fire. To the W of this construction, possibly a hearth, were found six lower jaws of wild boars, with holes perforated on the underside, possibly for suspension. It has been suggested that the bones had undergone a drying process for the detachment of the tusks. The associat- ed pottery dated from the end of the LH IIIB2 period. Another area in trench 13, which was possibly the third room of the building, has yielded evidence for workshop activ- ities, including ivory objects and scraps, some preserving traces of toolmarks, as well as quantities of pumice. In the same area were discovered fragments of frescoes and roof- tiles. It seems that the rectangular building was abandoned suddenly at the same time as the Linear B archives and the ivory workshop in Odos Pelopidou. The deposit below the floor of room 2 was associated with LH IIIA2/B pottery. Among the portable finds in the other trenches were a rock- crystal sealstone, with the representation of an animal, a krater with figured decoration (chariot, heraldic sphinxes) and a human clay head, part of a vase in the form of a human being, similar to those discovered at Mycenae (W.D. Taylour, Antiquity 44 [1970], 272 pl XXXIXC). The MH period was represented by pottery (Minyan) and fragmentary architectural remains, especially those of a room, under the floor of which was discovered the pit-grave of an adult. Finally, the EH period was represented by the greatest part of an apsidal building, of considerable dimensions (13 x 6.30m), consisting of an ante-chamber and a main room, dat- ing from the EH III period (building F). Along the axis of the main room was found a solid rectangular clay structure/plat- form, and to the W, inside the apse, a stone-built structure, pos- sibly a store. Under the apse were located remains of the EH II period. In the Ag. Triada area, at the site for the 2nd Lykeion, were excavated the building remains of a small farmstead of R date, with evidence of an earlier occupation, during the A, C and HL periods.

The walls of the main room were built in the isodomic style, and were founded on earth. 25m N of the R building was recorded an irregular stone peri- bolos (Fig. 109), inside the NW comer of which was discov- ered a considerable number of miniature bowls, the majority intact, probably dedications, in the context of an open-air shrine, related to agriculture (Fig. 110). Finally, 25m E of the R building, a cist-tomb of SMyc date was excavated. (ADelt 275-94) Continued excavations on Byz sites in the city centre are described in detail (ADelt 77-84). OT 377 on Odos Louka Bellou provided a rich stratigraphical horizon of the town's history, with evidence for Byz inhabitation interrupted by a destruction layer caused by fire dated to ca 566/7 by coins. A second destruction layer dates to 886-912, if the coin finds provide an accurate record. Pottery from the 7th to the 9th Cts was found in intervening layers, providing an important con- tribution to finds from the so-called 'dark ages'. Re-inhabita- tion begins in the 10th Ct and once again involved private dwellings on approximately the same ori- entation as earlier levels. A coin and pottery finds date a third destruction level to the end of the 9th Ct. Part of a 9th-10th Ct chapel was uncovered, . including fragments of marble reliefs. Burials therein contained coins of the 11th and 12th Cts, indicating localized burial activity following the structure's collapse. This phase is poorly repre- i sented due to later destruction of the relevant phase. Only meagre coin and pottery finds attest Frankish and Venetian occupation. (ADelt 77-80) Odos Teiresiou 12 and G. Diamante. Excavations on OT 404 uncovered evidence for Byz occupation from the 9th to 13th Cts, previously unknown in this area. Evidence for workshop activity of an uncertain nature was found in association with a coin of 870-9, while a destruction layer included anonymous folles of 976 (or 1030?), possibly to be identified with Bulgar raids of 996. Following this destruction, the area was used as a private dwelling, providing fine glazed pottery and a final coin of 1078-81. A third phase included the construction of a new floor, found in association with a hoard of Komnenian coins. This phase probably ended with the Norman sack of 1147, to be succeeded by a much disturbed layer with coins dating from 1185-90, and pottery of the beginning of the 13th Ct. (ADelt 80-1) Apparently the first gold Byz coin to be found in Thebes was uncovered on Odos Pelopida, a nomisma of Theophilos (829-842) which joins bronze coins of the same emperor from a time when Thebes was the capital of the theme of Hellas. (ADelt 81) Evidence for original construction work was uncovered during investigations into the floor of the important dated church (872) of Agios Gregorios Theologos on Odos Dirkes. Burials were associated with this site. (ADelt 82-3, 83-4) EUBOEA Aidepsos.

During excavations to the NE of the main building of the electrical company, the remains were revealed of a bath complex of R date, including a rectangular room (A), two apsi- dal areas (B, F) incorporating two praefumia, and six more rooms (A, E, Z, H, 0, I) with arrangements for a hypocaust and stone-paved floors.

In the same gener- al area, was also discovered a large sector of the urban housing of the anc. town. A HL house, part of an anc. road and an apo- *.. ;- .thetes of the 4th Ct BC, were located in the , Eustathiou plot. Part of another 4th-Ct BC house and of an anc. road, running for a length of 6m, as - well as an apothetes of G date, were identified in Odos Egelochou Tarantinou. An important C building, associated with 5th-4th Ct BC pottery and bronze coins, was excavated in the Liou plot. In Odos Timokratous Phanokleous was exca- vated the andron of an important HL house, the floor of which was decorated with a high-quality mosaic with a mythological subject, representing Triton and Skylla in a marine context (dolphins). The border was decorated with the theme of 'the running dog' (ADelt pl. 115d). The mosaic, one of the most important specimens discovered in Eretria, was made of small pebbles, probably by the same artist who worked in the "House with the mosaics", and can be dated to the 4th Ct BC. In the same plot was also found a section of the anc. fortifications, while another section was discovered, along with a rectangular building of the 4th Ct BC, on the road to the Malakonta hous- ing estate. At the junction of Odos Menedemou and Archaiou Theatrou was discovered part of an atrium, with a pebble floor, and a well. Patches of other mosaic floors were recorded in Odos Eunomou Kephisiou and Daphnephorou, respectively. Three tile-roofed tombs and two sarcophagi, of HL date, were excavated at the junction of Odos Timokratous Phanokleous and Kanare. Associated with one of the sarcophagi were frag- ments of wall paintings. Finally, remains of 14 walls were excavated at the junction of Odos Timokratous Phanokleous and Archaiou Theatrou. (ADelt 311-14) Stephan Schmid reports on the activities of the Swiss School in Eretria in 2000: 'In 2000 the Swiss School carried out two excavations at Eretria and one survey on the territory of Eretria, more precise- ly the areas surrounding the city. At point E/600 NW the fifth season of excavation was used to complete the information about the structures found so far (Fig. 111). Several of these are related to the building that we would like to interpret as the local Sebasteion (Fig. 112), at least in its R building phase (a more detailed report on the building can be found in Journal of Roman Archaeology 14, 2001). It was verified that wall M49 indeed connects the building with the huge wall M34 that forms the limit of the anc. main street crossing the site. Therefore, during the R Imperial period, the Sebasteion has a clearly emphasized front part, a typical feature of R temples, although in our case it should be considered as a rather free interpretatio eretriana. Inside the building itself the analysis of the several base- ments and foundations for statue bases showed a clear sequence of relative chronology. At present we can point out at least four different and successive phases of sculptural decora- tion covering at least the 1St to 4th Cts AD. Although the latest coin from the destruction debris dates from only ca AD 350, we would like to date the destruction of the monument some- what later, probably related to Christian iconoclasm. To the N of the above-mentioned main street, a new R installation, probably related to production activities, was  ill 4 :: r . i· 'u -·· t a t·- :'uj :Y X:</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 63 : .

The structure has a lengthy channel ending in a bothros that, to judge from the steps built in its walls, was regularly cleaned. For the moment it is not clear whether this installation is related to the supposed dyeing and fulling activities to the S of the street that were excavated a few years ago (cf. AR 1998-99, 60-1). In 1996 part of a structure built of huge irregular stones (ST8) was found near to a well of the LC period (ST13). It turned out that this was a wall, unrelated to the well and belonging instead to an ambitious project of the LG-EA period, to be associated with the known Eretrian efforts to canalize the seasonal torrents that apparently caused flood- ing during the G period. Around 700 BC the main torrent seems to have been canalized using this huge wall, found on several occasions in various locations in Eretria, the most impressive remains being located at the W gate. During the 2000 season on the site under investigation the same wall was followed in the area EF/4, where it begins to turn towards the S. In the area of the temple of Apollo the third consecutive season of excavation was carried out under the direction of S. Verdan (Lausanne). The problem of seasonal floods seems to have affected this area as well and so one of the earliest con- structions during the G period, a long wall (Fig. 113: 1-12 M3), was interpreted as a kind of protection against such torrents. However, at the site of the later temple of Apollo, so far no real torrent has been discovered, but a rather different type of layers, apparently resulting from temporary inunda- tions (gray zones on Fig. 113). Other walls, like M5, seem to belong to a kind of spatial organization during the G period, although it is far from clear how this worked and how we should interpret the different installations within these walls. 114. Eretria: apsidal building The most interesting structure unearthed so far during this project is an apsidal building, showing two construction phases (Fig. 113: M4, M6, M10). M6 and M10 belong to the first building phase that seems to be contemporaneous with the so called Daphnephoreion, i.e. mid or 2nd half of the 8th Ct BC, which also showed a similar construction technique with post-holes inside and outside the stone foundations (Fig. 114). M4 represents the second building phase that can be dated towards the end of the 8th Ct BC. Towards the rear of this later building a base constructed of tempered clay was discovered and on top of it, apparently in situ, the foot of a very large krater with a diameter of more than 50 cm. The function and use of both phases of the building - dwelling, cult place, public building, etc. - remain unclear. However, it should be emphasized that, unlike all other apsidal build- ings excavated at that spot so far, the new one is oriented more or less towards the E. Further, it lies on a common axis with an altar that in its first built phase was of a rounded appearance and is usually thought to belong to the so-called Hekatompedos (no. 2 on Fig. 113) that would be contempo- raneous with the second building phase of the new apsidal construction. Several pits excavated in the neighbourhood of these apsi- dal buildings (Fo36, Fo44, Fo59 on Fig. 113) contained extraordinarily rich ceramic material, mostly vases of types associated with drinking, either in private or at symposia. The survey directed by P. Simon (Lausanne), focusing on the area immediately outside the anc. city as well as on some more distant parts, produced interesting observations on the spatial organization of agricultural installations related to the city, to the water supply of anc. Eretria, and to the defensive system of the area. Particularly remarkable are some fortified peaks, consisting of approximately rectangular structures built of small, barely dressed stones without mortar (Fig. 115); their chronology is problematic and they could date anywhere from antiquity to the early modem period, when brigands made life difficult in most parts of Greece.' Karystos. R and Byz walls were excavated, in the area of Loutra Palias Choras Karystou, at the site of a farm or the house of a bishop, dated to the EByz period (450-550 AD). (ADelt 318) Kato Oreoi. In one plot were discovered two rooms of a house of C date, one of which was used as a storeroom (pointed amphoras); in another, part of an ER house with a pebble floor.

Important remains of apsidal buildings of MG date, associating the area with the site of anc. Kyme, tombs of the SMyc period and rich Myc, MH and EH deposits, associated with architectural remains, were excavated at the site of Viglatouri Oxylithou. (ADelt 316) Manika. Nine graves of EH date (?) were excavated in the Papakyriakou plot, three of which were approached by a dro- mos and a step. (ADelt 315-16) Skyros Three new rich tombs of the G period were discovered at the site of Peramata. The finds included bronze vessels and gold jewellery. (ADelt 316) PHOKIS Amphissa. At the junction of Odos Ylaithou and Roulia were located remains of the anc. fortification of the town, other parts of which have been excavated in the past. Here was revealed part of the N wall, which at this point formed a corer, and a rectangular tower. The architectural details suggest the exis- tence of a gate at this point, with an interior courtyard, a typi- cal example of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. The considerable width of these gates, through which passed main roads, was decreased inside the walls, by divisions perpendicular to the long axis of the gate, forming a dipylon. The walls were built in the isodomic, trapezoidal style, and were preserved to a maximum height of four courses. (ADelt 358) Antikyra. At the site of Palatia, at the foot of Siros hill, 17 graves were found, including three clay larnakes, one stone sarcophagus, three cist-tombs, seven hut-shaped, tile-roofed graves, and three pithos-burials. The tombs, part of the exten- sive extra-mural cemetery of anc. Antikyra, date from the 3rd and 2nd Cts BC. (ADelt 556-7) Distomo. Sections of the C/HL fortifications of the anc. town of Ambrossos were uncovered in four different plots, on the W and SW slopes of the Kastro hill (Odos Anapauseos). The pre- served stretches were preserved to a thickness of 2.20-2.30m; the two faces were built in the trapezoidal system, while the interior was filled with rubble and earth. The preserved heights ranged between 1.20m and 3.30m. Against the E face of one of these stretches of wall, on the W slope of the hill, a series of four rooms was excavated, which were used until the 4th Ct AD. In the section along the SW slope, a rectangular tower was also discovered. The remains of pottery workshops of R date were apparently erected over the ruins of the fortifications, after they had gone out of use, at a date certainly after Pausanias' visit in the 2nd Ct AD. They were used until the mid- 4th Ct AD. The sections of the fortifications located at the site of the mod. playground will be turned into an archaeological park. (ADelt 352-6) Galaxeidi. Along the coastal road of the mod. town are pre- served sections of the fortification walls of the anc. Locrian town of Chaleios, while another wall, associated with the inte- rior of the anc. fortifications, was identified in another plot of the mod. town. (ADelt 358-9) Kirra. In the E part of the Magoula, near an early Myc pottery kiln, remains of the PR (early Myc) settlement of Kirra were excavated, including part of a wall and two successive sections of trodden earth floors, on the earlier of which were found small fragments of carbonized wood, sea shells and animal bones. The undisturbed deposit above those floors was associ- ated with fragments of household pots, roof-tiles, and destroyed mud-bricks, from the wall. The deposit under the floors included MH pottery fragments. (ADelt 351) Polydroso. At the sanctuary of Demeter Erochos, cleaning operations were continued on the old excavations of Ch. Karouzos (1928-34), during which the intact NW comer of the peribolos was located, and the entire length of the N wall, with a staircase along its E sloping edge and exterior face. Other cleaning operations included the threshold of the propylon of the interior peribolos, and the staircase leading to the undug area of the site, where the excavator believed there to be an altar or a temple-like structure. (ADelt 357) NORTHWEST GREECE Two sites were located during the construction of the Egnatia Odos in the area of Ioannina: at Rache Platanias, in the plain E of Kastritsa hill, extensive structural remains of at least two HL houses were found, and at Agioi Apostoloi Pedinis two LC burials were located, along with remains of installations which include parts of walls and in situ storage vessels. (Epyov YnnHHO 3, 113) From Kerasovo, a hypocaust segment from R baths was brought in, having been found near the church ofAyia Paraskevi. From Nea Mousiotitsa, V. Notis brought in a bronze tub, two bronze flasks with partly missing bases, a bronze cast base of a vessel, a metal spear-head, a metal sword and fragments of a clay amphora with painted decoration. He found them in his field (at Palaiochano) after deep ploughing. A small-scale exca- vation was carried out at the point of their discovery, which revealed a cist-grave built of limestone slabs. (ADelt 429) In the area of Petralona, during surface survey around a quarry, Pal artefacts were discovered. They were associated with red-brown coarse-grain clay deposits of small thickness, which lie above the limestone depoits. In the area there is also plenty of flint in primary deposits within the limestone. Fifty items were recovered, of different types of flint, mostly flakes. Also included are some small lithic remains, typical of MPal technology, and a few cores, but the rest of the flakes are of unknown period.

A third excavation season was carried out in 1995, continuing previous trenches and starting new ones, aimed at horizontal uncovering of lithos- tratigraphic units and the determination of the geoarchaeologi- cal sequence; the result is a cross-shaped excavation within the grid. The aim is to define the role of the rock shelter in the UPal settlement pattern in Epirus. Continued excavation on axis P6 confirmed the results of earlier seasons, with the addition of a small, probably short- lived hearth. The trenches on the slope investigated the strati- graphic relationship between horizon IV and the thick lithos- tratigraphic units of axis P6: horizon IV seems to lie over hori- zon III, on a slope from S to N (the reason for this will be fur- ther investigated) and is lithographically extremely homoge- nous and rich in organic material. In the central sector, W of the Med burial, excavation of nine squares continued with thick deposits of horizon II and a complex of open hearths whose S and E edges are within the excavated area, with a large con- centration of ash and finds mainly on the periphery (known as 'drop and toss zones'). Flotation testing of samples from the ash deposits had negative results. In the SE sector excavation under the Med burial also revealed working surfaces, rich in organic remains; their rela- tionship with those of axis '6 and the central sector will be studied in detail. (ADelt 534-6) Study continued in 1998. (Epyov Y770 2, 155) Ano Kalentini. A looted cist grave with an N-S orientation was identified in the Nik. Pappa plot, E of the village. It was built of local grey schist. The long sides consisted of three irregular slabs, carefully placed (external measurements: 2.05x0.50m; internal: 1.68-0.45m). The N part of the cover slab had been removed during ploughing of the field and the corresponding part of the tomb had been disturbed. No other tombs or signs of activity were identified in the area. (ADelt 421) Arta (anc. Ambracia). In 1995 eleven plots were investigated, finds consisting mainly of house walls, pavements, roads, parts of drainage systems and dumps. Most of the architectural remains date to HL times and artefacts include mainly pottery (mostly undecorated; some glazed), fragments of clay fig- urines, a loom-weight, and fibulae, rings, nails, buckles, metal plates, pegs, etc. Many coins were also found in several plots, but they were often illegible. The rest belong mainly to the Ambracia types, dating to 238-168 BC. LC and R pottery and a fragment of a R glass vessel were found in plot 208. In plot 219 the walls date to the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC, while the road continued to be in use during HL times. The first phase of use of the house in plot 207 also dates to the 5th Ct BC. In plot 201, the destruction layers found across the exca- vated area date the collapse of the HL buildings to the early 2nd Ct BC, possibly 167 BC, during the destructions caused by the legions of Aemilius Paullus. The structural remains with their additions and later repairs date to the 4th-3rd Cts BC, whereas certain walls belong to the 6th Ct BC. Post-Byz dumps and a burial with no grave goods have also been found. Furthermore, 135 bronze coins were found in same plot, most belonging to the Ambracia type (238-168 BC); the most common type is that with the griffin: on the obverse a wreathed head of Zeus facing right and on the reverse a griffin also facing right, the letters AMBP and the name of the eponymous archon below, such as AEIOXO, EIIANAPOX, AAMIOI, etc. (Fig. 116). Plot 212 lies outside the fortification walls of Ambracia, and although no structural remains were located, there is plen- ty of HL pottery and a coin with the head of Acheloos on the obverse. The presence of pottery in the absence of any struc- tural remains possibly indicates that activities here took place in the open, or in temporary installations. These activities are thought to have been commercial, since the river was naviga- ble at least as far as Ambracia. A well in plot 210 was of particular interest. Little is pre- served due to the construction of a cesspit in an old house in its vicinity. However, a few sherds and a bronze coin to the W of the well date it to 238-168 BC. Wells have been found in sev- eral building blocks of Ambracia and were very important, since the city had no springs. In plot 209, the private house that was found had had a series of repairs, additions and changes, and had been in use from the 6th to the 4th Ct BC, with evidence of use until the 2nd Ct BC. Characteristic examples of the finds in this plot are part of a figurine mould with cloak folds and part of a moulded ter- racotta architectural ornament. G pottery (8th-7th Cts BC) was also found in the plot, not associated with any of the structures, confirming the habitation of the area long before the establish- ment of Ambracia. (ADelt 410-19) The construction of the new drainage system in the S and SW parts of Arta produced no anc. remains. In certain streets in the centre, however, more walls and floors were discovered, dating to LA, LC, HL and more recent periods. Part of a road was found in Maximou Graikou Street. In Skoufa Square, limestone slab fragments were found, possibly from a paved approach road to the church of the Virgin Paregoretria. (ADelt 419-20) A small section of the city walls was located in Markou Botsari Street, which connects with other sections of the walls found during construction work for the drainage system in 1999. It is 3.30 m wide and has a N-S orientation (ADelt 419). In 1999, part of the city wall was recovered in the S and NE areas of the city. (Epyov YnHO 3, 113) The excavation of the SW cemetery, which started in 1992, was continued in plot 166 (Theodorou plot on Kommenou Street). The monumental road (10-12m wide) was excavated in 1993 and in 1995 the funerary periboloi on either side were examined. The study was not limited by the plot boundaries, and the excavation was extended to the E, where the eastern extension of the cemetery was revealed. Study con- centrated on the part of the cemetery E of the road, as well as a small part of it in the NW of the plot (Figs. 117-18). The cemetery includes funerary periboloi defined by two retaining walls along the road and other smaller ones at right angles to it. The periboloi are mainly H-shaped, but in the NE part of the plot there is at least one example of a square peribolos. Behind</page><page sequence="66">66 DAVID BLACKMAN 117, 118. Arta: SW cemetery 119. Arta, SW cemetery: amphoriskos the periboloi with facades in the retaining wall of the road, there are others at a higher level, since the ground slopes upwards to the E. The periboloi enclose tombs and cist graves with cinerary urns: 71 cist graves, 13 tile-roofed burials and 12 pit graves were studied this year; a poros limestone sarcophagus with a limestone cover slab was also found, as well as 11 cinerary urns placed directly into the soil and not in a cist grave. Most cist graves are meticulously constructed: their sides consist of a single slab of local limestone; the narrow slabs bear sockets for the longer ones. There are also several HL cist graves, built hastily of a larger number of irregular slabs and parts of funer- ary stelae in secondary use. Fifteen of the cist graves contain more than one burial. In four of these the burials and their grave goods are clearly defined, but in the rest, which contain up to five burials, there has been no attempt to preserve the earlier bodies, the skeletal remains of which have been swept to the sides of the tomb to make space for the new body. In two 120. Arta, SW cemetery: pelike cases, besides the inhumations, the tombs contained cinerary urns with cremations. Many of the tombs have been looted, and some have been disturbed by rain. On the basis of the grave goods, the tombs date between the 5th and the 1St Cts BC, with the majority belonging to the HL period. The more usual grave goods found are clay vessels, which include mainly perfume vases, but also skyphoi, cups, oil lamps, lekythoi, trefoil-mouthed jugs, stemless cups, hydriai, amphoriskoi (Fig. 119), etc. Also present in the tombs were bronze and metal strigils, figurines, dolls and knuckle-bones in child burials and gold danakae with relief depictions of a caduceus or winged Pegasus. Rarer were Phoenician glass ves- sels, jewellery, gold wreaths and bronze mirrors, and coins were almost completely absent. The cinerary urs are mainly clay amphoras and pelikae (Fig. 120), usually with lead lids; TP15a b"''" J a 1-``·\- ,7 4 P ni P '·-· c, PG s, ag ···;oa 9i :E ···· ·r-, nr -i.

The richest tomb in terms of grave goods was cist grave X on the W side of the funerary road, .] which must have belonged to a rich Ambracian woman of the LHL period. Besides 37 clay ves- sels, finds included a boar figurine, a figurine of an actor, two bronze mirrors, a bronze comb, and a large amount of jewellery (Fig. 122), such as gold rings, chains of gold and/or camelian, a gold disk with stippled decoration suspended on four rings, gold ear-rings in the form of Nike, two ear-rings in the shape of a bird made out of a blue stone from which hangs a gold flower, gold danakae depicting Pegasus, parts of silver ear-rings, semi-circular in shape, and part of a silver plate with a face in relief. (ADelt 412-4) In 1999 another 15 plots were investigated and work on the new drainage system was closely observed. Further houses were revealed, with successive phas- es dating from the A to the LHL periods, roads, avenues and drainage systems, all of which belong to the urban structure of anc. Ambracia. R structural remains were located in the SW area of the city, outside the walls, while remains of oil-press installations of the same period were identified in the area of the W cemetery. Parts of the E and the W cemeteries of the city were also investigated. (Epyov YHnO 3, 113) Dodone: Investigation of the great sanctuary continued in 2000 under Ch. Souli, A. Vlachopoulou and K. Gravani (Fig. 123). Work was confined to part of the corridor dividing the N from the S part of the prytaneion. This sector was covered by a deep LR and ECh fill containing R coins and pottery. The excavation was extended, to include the stoa, known from the era of Karapanos, which borders the E side of the prytaneion and extends to its SE. Six statue bases were found in situ in front of this section, four rectangular, one column-shaped and the sixth, a semicircular exedra. (Ergon 2000, 79-82) Kastri (anc. Pandosia). Two plots were excavated, within which a small part of the city walls and part of a house were identified. (Epyov YnITIO 3, 114) Kastritsa (10km SE of Ioannina). Archaeological study on Kastritsa hill focused on building G, located on the top of the hill, E of the monastery of St John the Baptist (Fig. 124). Several walls of large limestone blocks, belonging to the struc- ture, were visible on the surface. The study was confined to the cleaning of the external walls to reveal completely the facade, and the opening of trial trenches in its central and N areas. Building G is rectangular (16.90 x 14.50m), its external walls built with polygonal ashlar blocks, preserved to one or two 49 123. Dodone: sanctuary site O sk. .... W.S</page><page sequence="68">68 DAVID BLACKMAN 124. Kastritsa: building F courses. In certain parts, two of these walls are preserved to a height of 1.80m. During the excavation two successive destruction levels were established within the building, and nine stretches of inte- rior walls were discovered. The older destruction level is not particularly thick and is confined mainly to the central part of the building. From this layer comes a small amount of domes- tic pottery (bg kantharoi, small handleless skyphoi, etc.), which date from the beginning of the 3rd Ct to the first decades of the 2nd Ct BC. Terracotta figurine fragments were recovered main- ly from the central area of the building, as were several conical loom-weights, some of them bearing stamps. A substantial number of Cor roof tiles was recovered, the varying types indi- cating successive repairs of the building's roof. Several of these tile fragments have stamps, mainly of two types: triangu- lar, with a six-leaf rosette in relief and an illegible inscription around it, or rectangular, with a dolphin in relief and below it the letters AD. The dating of the earlier phase of the building was established by the discovery of several bronze coins, including one from Ambracia (233/2-168 BC) and two from Abdera (246-221 BC). The exterior walls (T1, T2, T3, T4) and interior walls T6, T11 and T13 belong to the HL phase of the building. They are of ashlar blocks and are set on the natural rock, which has been cut wherever necessary. In the S part of the same wall, a monolithic threshold was discovered in situ; it continues beyond the boundary of the excavation area. The building was abandoned around the mid-2nd Ct BC and its later phase began in LR times, during which the original external walls were restored and preserved. The interior of the building was flattened, the HL fills were partially removed and more interior walls were added - an interpretation based on the presence of some HL pottery and the limited extent of the HL destruction level. The later walls, preserved to the height of one course, are of unworked stone and their foundations lie either on the HL destruction level or on the natural rock after the removal of the earlier fills. The later level has produced domestic pottery, including pithos fragments dating from the end of the 4th to the end of the 6th Ct AD. Within the layer many schist slabs were found, probably used for the roof of the building, a practice maintained until recently in the area of Ioannina. Three bronze coins (Marcian, Valentinian and a semi-follis of Justin II) date the later construction phase of the building to later antiquity. In terms of its construction and periods of use, building G shows similarities with the main complex that was studied in 1994 in the natural plateau NW of the monastery of St John the Baptist (AR 1999-2000, 65-6). Based on the above, it is con- jectured that the Kastritsa acropolis was plundered by the Romans in 168 BC, as was the case with other mainland poleis and small towns mentioned in the literary sources. A possible continuity in habitation of the area during later LHL times can- not be established through excavation, owing to the distur- bance and removal of the fills by later inhabitants. The various buildings, private or public, on the naturally fortified acropolis were repaired and partly restored and re-inhabited from the 4th Ct to the 6th Ct AD. The various repairs to the acropolis walls can be dated to the same period. The use of the already exist- ing HL buildings during the ECh period indicates the new set- tlers' sudden and pressing need for shelter, as well as the diachronic strategic position of the acropolis within the basin. The final abandonment of the buildings is probably associated with raids by new populations within the province of Old Epirus, towards the end of the 6th Ct AD. (ADelt 407-9) Kastrosykia. A cist grave was discovered during the opening of a road SE of the village. It was built of four single poros limestone slabs, and had three cover slabs of the same materi- al. The body had been placed on its back with the head turned to the right and the hands crossed at the sternum. The skeleton was 1.70m in height and well preserved. A bronze ring was found on one of the fingers, bearing a male figure with a hel- met and a cloak, possibly Hermes. Two bronze coins were also found, one very deteriorated, the other dating to before the mid-4th Ct BC. (ADelt 428) Kryopege. A looted cist grave was identified on a high plateau, at Lakkopoules, an area N of the archaeological site of Kassope, behind the hill of Anemomylos. It has an E-W orien- tation, and is built of four standing single slabs and three cover slabs of grey limestone. A wall, possibly belonging to a peri- bolos, was located N of the tomb.

Rescue excavations took place in two plots in the area of the anc. city, which is located in the NE of the island. Part of the urban plan was revealed, organized in rec- tangular blocks with houses on either side of a drain. N cemetery. A total of 41 graves were investigated (cist graves, pit graves, roof-tiled graves and sarcophagi), which yielded rich grave goods. (Epyov YIHHO 3, 113-14) Kariotes (Leukas). Following the illegal opening of a cesspit and the destruction of an anc. wall in the Spyr. Theiakou plot, the cleaning and study of the remains was car- ried out. Two parallel walls were identified, leading towards the coast, and built varyingly of ashlar and crudely cut blocks. The pottery included LC bg pottery, amphora bases and han- dles and tile fragments. Flint artefacts were collected over the whole of the plot, most probably of the MPal period. The size and construction of the architectural remains indicates their association with maritime trading activities. Study of the stratigraphy of the cesspit revealed the possible presence of the seabed. (ADelt 429-30) Markianada. A study of Megalongos Zygou, the upland area between the settlements of Kleisto and Zygos, confirmed the presence of a cemetery, and a short excavation followed. The cemetery extends over the plateau of a hill and most of the tombs are concentrated in two open spaces, whereas some are under vegetation. In all, 12 cist graves were found, none of which had preserved their cover slab, and all were looted. They were built hastily of local grey schist. Their longer sides con- sist of two to four irregular slabs (total 1. 1.60-1.80m). At their ends the slabs converge, so that a slab on the narrow sides was not necessary. The maximum internal width of the tombs is 0.35-0.60m. Tombs 1 and 2 were found in the area with vegetation W of the W open space, but are not intact. Tomb 3 was found in the W part of the W open space and 0.80m from this, tomb 4. Tombs 5-10 are concentrated in the E part of the W open space. Tomb 7 had the only skeleton in situ, from the pelvis down. It was placed with the head facing W and has a pre- served length of 0.80m. Scattered bones were found between the tombs, probably disturbed by the looters. In the E open space of the plateau, parts of tombs 11 and 12 were found, also without grave goods. Despite the presence of some Byz sherds in a trial trench, the construction of the tombs and their vary- ing orientation indicate that that they are probably ancient. Due to the thick vegetation of the area, no associated settlement was identified. (ADelt 420-1) Nikopolis. Work on the Cleopatra multidisciplinary research programme continued in 1995, focusing mainly on computeriz- ing the archaeological (architectural remains and artefacts), top- ographical and administrative data of the archaeological site. Study of the monument of Augustus involved completing the excavation of the area already dug at the S facade of the podium. This is the facade of the monument itself, which faces the anc. town with the straits of Actium in the distance. Like the rest of the podium, it consists of ashlar masonry, of well- cut limestone blocks. Cuttings were identified in the lower courses, which were used to attach the bronze rams of Antony's fleet. An area destroyed by soil erosion was found in the E section of the podium facade, and 3m S of the podium facade, part of an opus caementicium retaining wall was dis- covered. The exterior face of this had an opus quasi reticala- tum facing, and the interior a facing of mortar, probably for insulation; it is not very well preserved. On the wall, for a length of ca 3m, clay cylindrical pipes were found, part of a drainage system. Close to the masonry of the facade was a small wall (8m long) built of square bricks, bearing crosswise incisions on their surface. Loose masonry found in this area was probably placed to prevent soil erosion, though it appears that this was mainly prevented by the retaining wall. In the W section of the podium facade, the preservation of the masonry is much better. The top surface of the opus caementicium wall is found again in this area. On top of this, a clay drainage pipe was identified, similar in construction and direction to the one found in the E section. The excavation in this area thus revealed that the founda- tions of the podium consist of opus caementicium masonry, and the inadequacy of such foundations to support the weight of the structure is problematic. As a support system for the rams, four small walls were discovered, parallel to the facade, and corresponding directly with four cuttings. Ca 4m W of the SW corer of the podium, the exterior face of the continuation of the retaining wall was located at a lower level, with a coat- ing of opus quasi reticulatum. This part of the wall possibly gave support to the main section of the retaining wall and an access route to the area of the rams. In both areas of study, an immense number of marble frag- ments of sculptures and architectural elements, of tile frag- ments and of chips of hewn stone were found. Particularly interesting were fragments of stone sculptures (a type of staff- bearer, a relief of a female figure, a spearhead, reliefs bearing ship bows and rams, etc.). The architectural elements include two fragments of tufa pillars and an Ionic capital; some of the roof tile fragments bear stamps, one of which dates to post-3rd Ct BC and another pre-48 BC. The marble sculptures and the stone and clay architectural elements belonged to various structures of the upper level of the podium, from where they fell onto the podium. Pottery tends to be limited and non-diag- nostic. The presence of HL pottery in the fills in front of the retaining wall is probably due to the transfer of soil from the surrounding area during the original construction of the monu- ment, or during later repairs. A large amount of lead was also found, probably from the clamping of the podium's ashlar blocks and architectural elements. The discovery of three frag- ments of the votive inscription is of great importance. The first was already known and reads: TI NEP. The other two were found on the SSE side of the podium and bear the characters: IM-P[I] and V[S]. Another limestone Cor capital was recov- ered ca 30m SE of the SE excavation section of the podium facade. The upper terrace of the monument covers an area 60 x 55m and is enclosed on three sides (S, E, W) by the podium wall, whereas on the N it is delimited by the stylobate of a stoa. The fills that had accumulated were removed to reveal the sty- lobate completely. Walls were discovered to the E and W of the stylobate and at its extreme limits two structures were identi- fied, of bricks and hard mortar, which were possibly the bases of columns or piers. N of this stylobate is another, of an inter- nal colonnade of the stoa, and further N its toichobate. The walls in this area have also been affected by soil erosion. Outside the toichobate is a drain made of bricks and roof tiles with an internal coating of hydraulic mortar. It is not certain whether this was for the run-off of the water that collected on the roof of the building, or for bringing in water from the neighbouring hills for the installations of the monument. Among other finds, an impressive number of tiles stamped with Greek letters originate from the area of the stoa, for example the words NIKOBOYAOYand [NI]KOMAX[OY] dating to the HL and ER periods, NIKH4I dating to the 2nd-3rd Cts BC, and CQTHPIXOY, a very well-known name from inscriptions of the HL and R periods (Fig. 125). Along the stylobate a few fragments of diagnostic undecorated pot-</page><page sequence="70">70 DAVID BLACKMAN 125. Nikopolis: ......i::i ......· tile with stamped name tery of secular use were found, apparently used for the trans- fer and planting of plants. The location of fragments of simi- lar pottery in other areas of the upper terrace of the monument indicates the presence of a small wood laid out in the open-air sanctuary. Foundation walls were found in the W and E areas of the upper terrace, and in its SW area, part of the NW face of a stone-built structure of roughly-cut masonry. In the same area, ca 5m NW of the podium and parallel to it, a built-in squared drain was discovered, built of concrete, its vertical sides faced with opus testaceum and its base covered with roof tile frag- ments. It is similar in construction and direction to the drain recovered N of the toichobate of the stoa at the N edge of the terrace. Ca 14m SW of the stoa stylobate, towards the central part of the terrace, a square structure of crumbly sandstone slabs was found; it has been identified as the foundation of a pedestal on which a statue was probably placed. Ca 7m SW of the stylobate, a small square brick structure was discovered with a stone slab for a base. The interior of the structure yield- ed no finds. Most of the finds from the upper terrace consist of scat- tered structural remains and architectural decorative ele- ments, the fragmentary state of which prevents the establish- ment of their origin. A small amount of secular pottery was also found in this area, dating to HL and ER times. (ADelt 421-8) In 1999, conservation work and recording was carried out on the walls of the monument of Augustus. Further excavation recovered many clay architectural elements and marble frag- ments of a frieze with compositions in relief. The walls of the R villa of Antoninus were also conserved, as was the larger part of the decorated mosaic floors which had been discovered in earlier years. (Epyov Y71IO 3, 114-5) Philippias, Pantanassa Monastery. P. Vokotopoulos complet- ed the repair and restoration of the floor, begun last year. Decorative elements of the walls of the S chapel have been filled in and the tiled roof restored. Cist-graves were found beneath the floor, one of which used as its side a marble floor tile decorated with plants and two Seric wheels, within which a hunting scene is depicted. A plaque from the same marble tile was found in the floor of the church of the neighbouring vil- lage, Romia. One of the more important sculpted pieces was part of a marble iconostasis showing three birds in one comer. (Ergon 2000, 76-78) Zoodochos. Excavation in the Lolidis plot located the founda- tions of a rectangular building of recent date, within which a few ashlar blocks, probably HL, had been incorporated. No portable finds were found. The ashlar blocks may come from a building not yet identified, possibly on the neighbouring acrop- olis of Passarona in Megalo Gardiki. (ADelt 409-10) SOUTHERN THESSALY Almyros, anc. Halos. The investigation of the HL town of Nea Halos (a Greek-Dutch collaboration project) continued in 1995 with the study of the finds from excavations and surface inves- tigations of previous years. An excavation was also carried out in the SE gateway of the town. The town is situated between two valleys connected by a main road across the town from the NW to the SE gate. The central gateways were courtyard-type with two square towers on the front. The remains of the SE gateway had already been uncovered in 1982 and in 1995 a systematic investigation took place with the aim of producing an hypsometric map of the modem fill covering the gateway. During cleaning of the site, seven deep trenches dug by illicit excavators were found. Six trial trenches were cut in the same places in order to inves- tigate the gateway's construction and the stratigraphy of the overlooking hillock. The investigation showed that the lower part of the gate- way comprised large, regular limestone blocks which in certain parts were up to 3.5m in height. Its superstructure was of bricks which had disintegrated with the passage of time and had in part covered the foundations of the gateway. The trenches yielded evidence of occupation in the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct BC. It appears that the gateway continued to be occupied after the destruction of HL Nea Halos ca 265 BC. In one of the test trenches inside the wall, W of the gateway's entrance, 15 silver coins were found. (ADelt 369) Alonnisos. In recent surface survey of the mountainous plateaus of Alonnisos (suitable sites for the cultivation of grain, vines and olives), a large number of rural constructions of sea- sonal and permanent settlement have been recorded and dated to the C and HL periods. In certain establishments the finds confirm a diachronic human presence from R and Med times up to the mod. era. The agricultural character of the establish- ments is shown by: 1) the abundance of storage vessels (jars, amphoras); 2) stone tools used for the processing of cereals (millstones, mortars); 3) stone structures used for the produc- tion of oil and wine (wine-presses); 4) the architectural model of a rural establishment which presupposes the existence of a central building with a circular or rectangular plan to serve as a dwelling or a place for the preservation of stored goods and an open courtyard around it with auxiliary areas. Some of these isolated rural establishments present many of the features of the fortified rural dwellings studied on Skopelos. The establishments were found in the E part of the island. The Garbitses site yielded sections of a circular build- ing (di. 6.9m) built of large squared limestone blocks. In the surrounding area there are analemma walls built of re-used blocks, Cor-type tiles, fragments of storage vessels and marble architectural members possibly belonging to the Byz period. On the Vouno site parts of a building were uncovered dating to antiquity. The Koumaros Hill yielded sections of a wall, oriented N-S, im wide and 0.5m in height built of local schist stones, while in various parts of the wall the natural rock was used. It appears to be of great length, perhaps starting from the Agios Konstantinos area and extending to Agios Georgios. Due to the little evidence available it is not certain whether the wall is connected with the defence of the island or the agricultural and stock-raising activities of the inhabitants. Following illegal excavation on the Agios Konstantinos site the existence of a rectangular tomb was verified, possibly belonging to the IA (9th Ct BC), presuming that the SPG oinochoe handed in to the Ephorate derived from this tomb.</page><page sequence="71">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 71 Since facts about the civilization of the communities of Alonnisos and all the Sporades during the IA is almost non- existent, future evidence from the Agios Konstantinos site will prove valuable. It will determine, for instance, whether an organized settlement with a cemetery existed on the site. Apart from the indications of rural establishments on the sites of Kalamaki and Vamvakies, it was verified that these areas functioned as small-scale production units for amphora- making for the bottling of local wine and its exportation. These units were not of the same size as that of the Tsoukalia site. On the Kalamaki site a section of a building was found, possibly a kiln dated to the LR period. (ADelt 372-3) M. Kokkinokastro Islet. The collaborative research pro- gramme between the 13th EPCA and the EPS involved surface and geomorphological surveys in the S sector of the island. A brief excavation was carried out during 1994 and 1995 where D. Theocharis had excavated in the past. (ADelt 25, 276-9; 26, 299-300) The aim of the investigation was to study the strati- fication of the islet and the different phases of occupation dur- ing the Quaternary. The investigation once again confirmed the existence of stratigraphical problems caused by the erosion of the surface area and the disturbance of the upper deposits of the islet. Seasonal occupation during the BA is verified (and not before or after) and the existence of architectural structures of this period is uncertain. The deposits of the BA settlement are up to 0.8m in depth and are divided into two levels on the basis of the pottery found. The lower level is dated to the EBA and the higher level to the MBA. The lower level contained part of a hearth (9.8 x 0.55m, 0.05m th.), possibly seasonally occupied. The finds include a mixture of Pal and N tools with C and HL pottery, a fact which indicates that the objects were transferred from their initial places of deposit before the islet was cut off from Alonnisos. (ADelt 368-9) Geoarchaeological survey. The EPS carried out the second season of its Pal Survey Programme, in collaboration with the 13th EPCA. Trial excavation on the island of Mikro Kokkino- kastro was continued in order to determine whether the Pal remains found in 1994 in disturbed surface levels were a pri- mary or secondary deposit, and to study the origin and strati- graphic relationship of the petrified bones collected on the sur- face of the island. Much mixed material of historical and PR date, including MPal tools, was found in the upper levels; less disturbed lower levels contained evidence of EB occupation. Bedrock was reached without finding an undisturbed Pal horizon. The Pal finds may have been redeposited from a site elsewhere in Alonnisos before the islet was separated from the S shore of Alonnisos probably by the rise in sea level at the end of the Pleistocene. A geomorphological survey of the SE shore was carried out and a surface survey of the wider area of the Kokkinokastro peninsula. The latter produced 211 tools in sec- ondary deposit: mainly MPal, but other phases of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene may be represented. Clearly at Alonnisos neotectonic fac- tors have contributed decisively to an unstable geomorphological environment in which human activity developed in the upper Pleistocene: the result was much erosion and transport and re- deposit of Pal material. (ADelt 840-2 and fig. 5) :! Kyra Panagia (anc. Alonnisos). Apart from the Neolithic settlement found at Agios Petros, two fortified establishments were located which were occupied from the C to R times (ADelt 25, - 276-9). One is situated on the E side of Planitis 126. Alon: Bay with a polygonal fortification peribolos. The other is locat- ed on the bay of Agios Petros (Tzaneti site). A number of rural establishments belonging to the same period are found in the countryside. (ADelt 373) Tsoukalia. Dr Effie F. Athanassopoulou (ASCS) reports on the results of the second field season of 'Amphora production, agriculture and trade: the Alonnisos Archaeological project', which is a collaboration between the ASCS and the 13th EPCA (we regret that the report received by us last year and published in AR 1999-2000, 69-72 did not make this clear): 'The goals of the second field season were to complete the documentation of the surface material, to examine additional areas with geophysical instruments in order to locate surviving buried structures and to survey fields that are not covered by dense vegetation in the vicinity of the workshop. Systematic survey at Tsoukalia. This year we continued and refined the data recording and collection procedures established in 1999, when the site had been divided into eight different sectors; in 2000 we defined the boundaries of these sectors with precision. The dense surface ceramic material is concentrated in sectors I and II. The 2000 survey covered 136 squares, 3 x 3m in size. The ceramics in each square were divided into piles of body sherds, upper body, lower body, rims, handles, bases, non-amphora sherds, tiles and clay chunks (kiln debris). The fragments in each pile were counted and weighed and featured sherds were collect- ed. This year we expanded the categories of material we collected and added several more, e.g. clay chunks with preserved surfaces, overfired sherds or sherds that had clear defects, sherds with special characteristics (e.g. finger- prints), tiles with glaze, etc. On the basis of the information we are collecting we will be able to document the forms present at the site along with a statistical breakdown of their relative frequency. It is clear that amphoras represent the overwhelming majority of discarded vessels. There is a small number of open vessels that could have been used in the ceramic production process and most likely were manufactured at the site. We also found a piece of a lamp and a few sherds from lids. Another goal of the sys- tematic surface recording is to use the data to generate density plots of sherds across the site. In addition, the weight figures will provide an estimate of the number of discarded amphoras represented on the surface, once we obtain the weight of com- plete similar amphoras that have survived intact. A significant discovery this season was a substantial build- ing on a plateau on a nearby hill that overlooks the area of the workshop. A large area was cleared of the dense vegetation around the worked blocks that are visible on the surface. There are many more fallen blocks still covered by vegetation, espe- cially on the lower slope of the hill. It is likely that the flat cleared area represents a terrace/court associated with the building. (Fig. 126) nisos, Tsoukalia: worked blocks</page><page sequence="72">72 DAVID BLACKMAN The 'building on the hill' could have been a tower associ- ated with a fannhouse. There was no surface pottery around the structure; we only found two pieces of millstone. At this point the extent of the structure is not known. We carried out a geo- physical survey of the cleared area but it was not possible to detect the outline of the buried walls. The existence of the building indicates that our initial premise that the amphora workshop was part of an organized agricultural estate is prob- ably correct. There are examples of such an organizational pat- tern from other areas, notably the island of Thasos. Currently there are no comparative data from other parts of the island of Alonnisos; thus, we cannot tell how common or how unique such a structure was in the landscape of classical Ikos. Geophysical Prospection Survey. The second phase of the geophysical campaign continued through the application of magnetic techniques and ground penetrating radar (GPR). The purpose of the geophysical survey was to complete the cover- age of the site, explore some other areas of interest that were not covered in the course of the first phase (1999 survey sea- son) and carry out a number of experiments that could con- tribute to the resolution of some features that were identified in the previous exploration of the site. Field Survey. In 2000 we carried out a surface survey of fields and olive groves near the site of Tsoukalia in order to identify activity areas contemporaneous with the pottery work- shop. We did not attempt to survey wooded areas covered with dense vegetation. We concentrated instead on cultivated fields that had been ploughed. A total of 20 fields was surveyed, using a crew of between three and five, depending on field size. Fields were surveyed using transects, with field walkers spaced 5-10m apart and generally walking parallel to terrace walls. Each crew member counted the number of ceramic arte- facts observed on the surface in one transect across the field. These numbers were recorded at the end of each transect or at the end of 100m if the field was large. Potentially diagnostic artefacts were collected. In addition to a map and photographs of each field, a GPS reading was taken at each corer of the field for future relocation. In general, fields located uphill and to the NE of the pottery workshop contained a significant num- ber of artefacts. Most were coarse wares, primarily amphoras, some open vessels and pithoi. The majority of these date to the C period. Besides C period artefacts, some of the fields con- tained LR and Byz pottery as well. Overview. The 2000 field season marks the completion of the first phase of fieldwork at Tsoukalia. This exploratory phase, which has relied on non-destructive methods, has pro- duced rich results. Tsoukalia provides a rare opportunity to study a pottery production centre of regional significance. Overall, there are few systematic studies of well preserved amphora production sites that have been undertaken in Greece. In the case of Tsoukalia a model of socioeconomic organiza- tion has been developed that ties together pottery manufacture, agricultural production and trade. The results of the last two years provide support to the initial premise that amphora pro- duction should be approached within the organizational frame- work of estate-based agriculture.' E. Hatzidaki (EMA) continued her excavation of the C ship- wreck in 1999, studying the section opened in 1993 and lifting 80 amphoras of Peparethos and Mende type, a large mortar, the upper part of a small bronze tub and three tableware vessels. Anc. Demetrias. A rescue excavation was conducted on the Bourboulithra site in greater Volos on account of the construc- tion of a waste recycling plant. The construction site contains a section of the N cemetery of anc. Demetrias. Excavation 127. Kallithero: Skordas plot work for the same project in 1990 had uncovered anc. graves. (ADelt 45, 199-201). During 1995, 450 graves were investigated; excavation will continue and the results will be published in the 1996 ADelt. Dimeni. In 1995 restoration work began on the site, funded by the EU 2nd Community Support Programme. The work involved the consolidation of the walls and foundations of the central courtyard of the N settlement. Specifically, the archi- tectural remains of the one-roomed dwellings around the first peribolos as well as the peribolos itself were conserved. Ermetsi. During drainage work on the H. Koutsioumba plot the foundation of a wall was uncovered (I. 1.15m, w4. 0.45m) oriented NE-SW, comprising a row of small unworked stones. A second wall, almost parallel to the first, was also uncovered (1. 3.95m). The pottery found in the fills belongs to the C-HL times. The walls extend beyond the limits of the trench and probably correspond with the architectural remains excavated on the same plot in 1993. (AR 1998-99, 71) Sections of walls were found during trenching work on the T. Tsiadimou plot, at a depth of 0.55-1.5m. The most striking is wall 1, oriented N-S (1. 1.24m, w. 0.55m, h. 0.98m) built of large squared stones. Between the walls there were fragmen- tary layers of roof-tiles, traces of incineration and clay or trod- den earth floor fragments. The fills contained pottery sherds dated to C-HL times as well as clay loom-weights, figurines, bronze coins and iron nails. (ADelt 378) Kallithero (Sekliza). The Skordas plot is situated in the NE sector of the anc. town, NE of the anc. road which was uncov- ered on the A. Lagou plot (ADelt 37, 232). An earlier investi- gation had yielded part of a tower dated to the 4thl Ct BC. (ADelt 42, 266)</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 73 During foundation work for the construction of a house an excavation was conducted which uncovered two sections of anc. roads and sections of buildings that represent four occupa- tion phases, as indicated by the floors and wall repair-work. The last phase has a destruction layer caused by a fire which, on the basis of the coins found, is dated to the end of the 3rd Ct BC. The walls of the building have a low stone-built base of river pebbles and small unworked stones. The superstructure was made of unbaked brick and the roofs were covered with Laconian-type roof-tiles. There is no indication of a second floor. W of the tower in sector A, a toichobate section (1. 3m) was found parallel to the one belonging to the tower. Both toi- chobates define the anc. road (w. 2.5m) which was uncovered for ca 3m and probably followed internally the entire course of the wall. The paving of the road consists of trodden earth, small river pebbles and gravel. W of the toichobate a circular pit was found, possibly used for drainage purposes (depth 1.5m) In sector B an internal hypostyle courtyard (10 x 7m) was uncovered. Westwards the courtyard is defined by the external wall of the insula of the anc. town which is built of medium- sized dressed stones (Fig. 127). W of the toichobate, a road ori- ented N-S was uncovered paved in the same manner as the one found in sector A (ADelt 37, 232). Throughout its occupation, the courtyard served the same purpose; its floor rests on suc- cessive layers of earth and gravel with small river pebbles and slopes W-E. Noteworthy are two rubbish pits and a drainage system (clay pipe) which probably leads to the pit in sector A. N of the courtyard were uncovered sections of roofed areas which probably belong to another building. Among the artefacts found were clay weights and two bronze coins dated to the end of the 3rd Ct BC, while a Laconian-type roof-tile was found bearing a stamped relief inscription: ]YDEAO/Y. Two bronze coins of Antigonos Gonatas were found in the roofed area along with a tile frag- ment bearing the stamped inscription: ]MOXI. In the final occupation phases, the building was no longer hypostyle but closed: a wall oriented NW-SE was built, creat- ing four roofed rooms where most of the artefacts were found, such as iron nails, bronze objects, clay loom-weights, a female figurine mould, a large number of jars, millstones and coins. Noteworthy is the number of coins found (31), the earliest dat- ing to the 4th Ct BC while many belong to the last occupation phase (2nd Ct BC) The continued use of the building from the 4th to the 2nd Ct BC with successive restorations leads to the conclusion that the area represents a high degree of urbanization. The types of artefacts and their distribution within the establishment sug- gests that the building did not serve as residential quarters but as workshops in the commercial part of the city. The Andromachi Siokou plot is situated S of the public baths found in the A. Fitsili plot (ADelt 42, 267) and NE of the fortification wall uncovered on the E slope ofAgios Athanasios Hill.(ADelt 43, 254-5) On the occasion of foundation work for the construction of a house, a section of a toichobate was uncovered (1. 11.5m, w. 0.5m, h. 0.6m) built of limestone slabs of various sizes. W of the toichobate were found some limestone slabs (possibly the remnants of another toichobate). Both toichobates probably marked a road oriented NW-SE. Two bronze coins were found on the roadway, assigning it to the end of the 4th Ct BC. This date corresponds with the construction date of the town's forti- fication wall and street layout. In the layer of Laconian-type tiles two stamps were found: ]EAAA[ and ]AANO/O[. In the NW sector of the plot an earlier pit grave was uncov- ered, oriented E-W (2 x 0.6m). The grave was without offer- ings. Also found on the site were clay loom-weights, stone tools, a lamp fragment, a female figurine fragment and part of a clay louter. The toichobates and road show a homogenous destruction layer which could be associated with the destruction and evac- uation of certain parts of the anc. town in the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct BC. With the little evidence available, it is not possible to deduce that the road continued to be used during the period of contraction of the town. (ADelt 382-4) Kanalia. Metochi. In 1995 during the laying of foundations for the construction of a cow-shed a group of anc. graves was uncovered. A trench measuring 50 x 80m yielded seven graves (oriented E-W) two of which were completely ruined by exca- vation machinery and contained only a few skeletal remains. The remaining five were four cist graves made of schist slabs and one vaulted grave. The graves contain adult burials, apart from two cist graves whose dimensions and bone remains indi- cate child burials. Apart from one cist tomb in which two skele- tons were found, the graves contained one burial. The bodies were laid outstretched on their backs without grave offerings. Pottery collected from the trench suggests that the cemetery was in use during the 2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 361-2) Kedros. Chalida (outside the anc. city of Orthe: ADelt 37, 232). Two cist graves were uncovered on the site which had been disturbed by cultivation and illicit excavators. The graves are built of monolithic dressed limestone slabs (oriented E-W) with monolithic dressed cover slabs. The body in grave T1 is oriented W-E and laid on its back with hands placed on its thighs. No grave offerings were found; outside the grave were found unpainted C pottery sherds. In T2 the body is situated E-W on a monolithic dressed limestone slab and is positioned like the one in T1. The dis- turbed fill contained four fragments of a gold sheet, the thin- ness of which suggests that it was sewn on the clothes of the deceased (there are two holes on both its ends). The sheet bears a relief decoration with floral and animal motifs done by a skilled craftsman (probably imported) and is dated to the beginning of the HL period. (ADelt 385-6) Magoula Paliouriou. Following numerous illegal excava- tions, a short investigation was conducted in 1995 on the site located on a mound (magoula). Its aims were: the excavation of the IA tholos tomb found on the site; removal of the dis- turbed dumps of illegal excavations; stratigraphical and sur- face studies of the area; and a systematic investigation of the settlement. During the IA the site constituted a section of the town cemetery (not yet located), as indicated by the tholos tombs at the nearby Magoules site. The tholos tomb rests on a layer of clay fragments of a ruined N hut (di. 3.74m). There is a dromos on the E of the tomb which is 1.5m long in its first phase and 2.05m long in its second phase. When covered the tomb had equal height and diameter. Nothing was found in the tomb although its architecture was very well-preserved. The SW sec- tion of the tomb is intact (h. 1.5m, 1. 1.7m) while in the SE sec- tion survive a dromos, a part of the initial entrance and the entrance of the second phase of use. The walls are built of limestone and sandstone. The surface survey, the stratigraphical evidence and the N finds (pottery and tools) along with the symbolic representa- tions (figurines and decorated pottery) indicate that the site was occupied continuously in the EN (Proto-Sesklo) period up to the beginning of the MN period. Nine occupation phases were observed.</page><page sequence="74">74 DAVID BLACKMAN From the artefacts found it is apparent that the N settlers of the area had developed skills in: the cultivation of grain (sick- le handles, pounders), hunting (animal bones [deer, birds], clay sling-shots), animal breeding (animal bones [goats, sheep, cat- tle, pigs]), weaving (spindles), leatherwork (scraper), wood- work (axes) and cutting (blades, flakes). As for lithic technology, 165 pieces of obsidian and flint were found. Flint was the predominant raw material used (80%). The variety of colour and technology of the flint prod- ucts indicates the existence of many and different production units within the settlement. There were 31 tools found (no spear-heads or perforating tools) and the specific tool-types show that emphasis was placed on agricultural and cutting/carving activities. As for the pottery, the clay used was of good quality, the food vessels are well-baked and polished and there was a pref- erence for spherical shapes. (ADelt 384-5) Magoula Phanariou. In the course of widening of the National Railway line which follows the route Volos-Karditsa-Trikala- Kalabaka, certain artefacts were uncovered on a hill at Ambelia. As a result of this, a rescue excavation was conducted which yielded a farming/stock-rais- ing establishment dated to the end of LN and perhaps EBA period. Most of the evidence was collected from the NE slope of the hill which had remained uncultivated. At the lowest point of the NE slope was uncovered a flat structure made of stone slabs which appeared to be a type of stone-paved ramp leading to the constructions above. On a higher level, frag- ments of a clay floor were found as well as clay fragments of the superstructure. A small number of tools and pottery were found on the hill-slope. These include monochrome PR pottery and hand-made (mainly pithoi) vessels with thick walls. Most of the tools were made of chocolate-coloured flint. The results of the investigation assign the site of Magoula Phanariou to the end of the LN period, the so-called Chalcolithic period. The small depth of the fill indicates that the settlement had a short life-span. The investigation uncovered a group of graves dug into the ground and oriented E-W. A few graves contained offerings which included bronze jewellery such as bracelets, rings and earrings and are dated to the MByz period (9th10th Cts AD). There was an animal burial among the graves, probably belonging to a dog. (ADelt 381-2) Mavromati. In the course of deep ploughing of the Yphanti plot for the cultivation of cotton, limestone cover slabs were uncovered. The Ephorate conducted an investigation in the area which brought to light a group of five cist graves, orient- ed NE to SW; four were made of large roughly-worked lime- stone slabs, the fifth of grey-green sandstone. Graves TI and TII were recently looted, while the rest had been looted much earlier. No grave offerings were found apart from broken sherds. The graves are dated to the HL period and belong to the S cemetery of anc. Gomphoi, although they are relatively far from the site (ADelt 49, 329; 42, 265). It is evident that this cemetery extended over a large area and probably developed along the road which connected Gomphoi to the Ithomi site farther S. Moschato. Lianokokkala site (temple of Apollo). Work began with the arduous task of clearing the fallen roof-tiles within the temple which had been burnt down in antiquity. Thousands of tile fragments were studied in an effort to restore as many whole tiles as possible. This year the investigation took place in the W part of the cella behind the statue base which is situated almost in the centre of the temple. Among the earlier and well-baked Cor-type tiles were found tiles of a lower quality with parallelogram stamps bearing the names KX£oga(XXot and tiXeout. It is likely that these tiles were placed on the temple during restoration work on the roof. Following the clearing of the area, the lowest section of the cella's dividing wall was uncovered. This is thin (0.23m) and built of unbaked bricks, on the line of the second interior col- umn. At its N limit there is a doorway on the threshold of which were found small limestone stelae fragments, possibly re-used, bearing traces of letters. In the cella area were found fragments of a large clay box as well as a clay vessel in the floor with a circular opening for libations. The opening was covered with a round stone slab. (ADelt 375-6) Mouzaki (Anc. Gomphoi). The rescue excavation which con- tinued this year on the D. Karali plot yielded a building con- structed of poros stone plinths (AR 1999-2000, 73). Wall a in the SE sector reaches 5.97m in length with a width of 0.5m and one course high. At NE and SW corers, a is at right angles to walls P and y, oriented NW. Parallel to wall a is 8 (1. 10.91m, w. 0.4-0.5m) which is built of stones, pebbles and mud. Walls 8 and e appear to belong to a R dwelling which will be uncov- ered with the continuation of the investigation. Near the walls were scattered fragments of roof-tiles and bricks. The investigation also produced sherds and fragments of lamps and figurines of the LHL and R periods. The small finds comprise many iron nails, pieces of bronze objects and bronze coins, most of which are R. The area surrounded by the poros walls yielded a cist tomb oriented SE-NW and built of bricks with two limestone cover slabs (probably re-used) worked with a chisel. A few skeletal remains were found on the floor. The grave offerings consisted of three loaf-shaped weights, two pig teeth, fragment of an iron object and a glass fragment. The grave is dated to the LR peri- od. Parallel to wall 8, the rim of a limestone lamax was uncov- ered. The fill contained earth and tiles, while no offerings were found. (ADelt 380) Myrine (H. Pliassa plot). During construction work for the laying of foundations a section of an anc. road was uncovered. The results will be published in the 1997 ADelt. Nea Anchialos / Phthiotic Thebes. Burials and the remains of a secular dwelling are reported for 1995. Numerous coins were found in one burial site, dating from anc. to Ott. (ADelt 401-2) Petroto. (Liaskovo). During construction work for the laying of foundations at Agios Demetrios (A. Bichas site) a cist grave was ruined. The owner of the property handed in various offer- ings found in the grave, such as a clay vessel, an iron spear- head and a small knife. A small excavation followed which uncovered four more cist graves made of limestone slabs and oriented E-W, two of which had been destroyed in the past. The fill of the grave contained a bronze double pin, a bronze ring and a silver boat-shaped earring. These items comprised the offerings of a deceased woman. Grave offerings belonging to a male burial were also found and include: four iron spear- heads, an iron sword and an iron knife. Underneath the iron offerings were skull remains of the deceased. The third grave (TIll) was intact (interior 1. 1.73m, w. 0.59m). The body was laid on its back (the skull was situated on the E side of the grave). Grave offerings included: a bronze buckle, an iron knife and a bronze pin.</page><page sequence="75">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 75 In the fill of grave TIV were found two iron spear-heads. Grave TV (2.12 x 0.68m) was built of limestone slabs. On the cover slabs were found three iron spear-heads. Grave offerings include: fragments of an iron ring, two fragments of an iron object which appears to be a horseshoe and two horse's teeth. The graves correspond with the small fortified installation on the Palaeokastro Petrotou site, which controlled the passage across the R. Achelo6s from Thessaly to Epirus. The graves are dated to the end of the 3rd Ct BC and the 2nd Ct BC, during which time there were intense conflicts for the control of the area. (ADelt 378-80) Pezoula (Belagias plot). Traces of a Byz settlement were found and despite difficulties in clearing the terrain, a LByz date was tentatively established by surface pottery finds. This appears to have been the site from which the later nearby settlements of Pezoula and Neochori were originally populated. (ADelt 403) Pyrgos Kieriou. In the course of work for the widening of the National Highway from N. Monastirio to Karditsa and follow- ing the discovery of a section of the anc. cemetery on the Kotronolakes site, a rescue excavation was conducted in 1995. (ADelt 376) In an area covering 800m x 10m, a total of 112 graves were investigated, consisting of 63 cist graves, 32 clay larakes, 8 pit graves and 9 tile-roofed graves. The cist graves were made of two roughly-worked lime- stone slabs (w. 0.05m-0.15m) and were covered with two/three limestone slabs. Most graves had thin, monolithic limestone slabs placed on the floor. There were a few instances of ground inhumations. The lamakes were four-sided and made of orange, badly- baked clay of medium quality. The rims were wide, forming a band around the mouth. After the burial they were covered with limestone slabs. The pit graves were in the form of simple ditches and were covered with rectangular slabs. The tile-roofed graves were of the hut-shaped type. The adult graves measured, on average, 2 x 0.5-0.6m while the smaller graves (0.4 x im) were used for child burials. Oriented E-W (with the exception of two N-S), each grave contained one body laid on its back and head turned towards the E. Two graves contained successive adult burials. All the graves were badly preserved. Consequently grave offerings have been damaged and there is insufficient information con- cering the positioning of the deceased. The disturbance is probably due to the earthquake in Sophades in 1995. Similar cases have been reported and studied in Lamia and Lefkada. (ADelt 45, 253) Grave offerings were found in 46 graves, placed around the body, level with the hands, feet and head. The cist graves con- tained bg kylikes-skyphoi, kantharoi, a one-handled cup, a leky- thos, clay figurines, a silver earring, bronze and silver bow- shaped clasps and a section of a bronze strigil. Numerous iron nails found in the graves probably belong to wooden biers on which the deceased were placed. On the basis of the offerings, the graves are dated to the beginning of the 5th Ct-mid-4th Ct BC. Offerings found in the larakes include clay vessel frag- ments: a scent bottle, a kantharos (3rd Ct), a lamp (end of 4th Ct BC), a clay figurine fragment, two bronze rings and bronze coins. Most of the tile-roofed graves did not contain offerings and the only one worth mentioning is a bronze mirror with a han- dle found in grave 5. The excavation accidentally yielded a marble temple-shaped funerary stele with a relief representation. (ADelt 376-7) During a rescue excavation on the V. Tsiana plot which began in 1993 and was completed in 1995, building remains were uncovered which are dated from the times up to the R period. Under a layer of fallen roof-tiles was found a section of a building comprising four rooms (E-W) which are divided by five intersecting walls. The walls were built of unworked and roughly-carved stones bound with mud and between the cours- es were some roof-tiles. The foundations of walls 1 and 2 were wider than the superstructure creating an offset 0.08-0.lm wide. Room F had undergone reconstruction and larger stones from earlier occupation phases were used. Its entrance is rein- forced by a re-used stele. Contemporary with earlier construction phases of the building are wall fragments and a bell-shaped subterranean cis- tern found in the N sector of the plot. The cistern is built of small to medium-sized hewn stones and is 1.83m high. Traces of plaster were found on its inner surface. Also found at a depth of 0.5-0.98m were dissolved bricks, numerous iron nails, a clay lamp mould and a large storage jar in situ. These finds indicate the existence of a workshop which belongs to the same construction phase as the cistern. The pottery found mainly consists of unpainted domestic vessels. On the basis of the pottery and the coins found, the duration of occupation is from 1St Ct BC-4th Ct AD. Immediately underneath the R building, walls were found at a depth of 1-1.75m. Only two areas can be clearly distin- guished because they are constructed of well-built walls with large comer-stones. These areas probably belong to two sepa- rate buildings. The portable finds (pottery, coins) date this occupation phase to the 4th Ct BC. A section of a building with floors of trodden earth and gravel was found at a greater depth of 1.75m. Walls 13 and 14 were built of successive courses of small unworked stones and mud. The limited excavation space did not allow for the com- pletion of the building's plan, to which these walls belong. According to the pottery found, the construction was occupied at the end of the LH period. It should be noted it is the first time that a Myc settlement is found underneath Kierio. (ADelt 377-8) Skantzoura island (anc. Skandira). At the Kouroupi site a fortified establishment dated to the HL period was located, while in the countryside around the old monastery there are traces of rural establishments dated to antiquity. (ADelt 373) Skopelos. (Anc. Peparethos) Asklepieion. After an interruption of over a decade (ADelt 39, 146-7), the investigation of the Livadi-Ambeliki site was resumed with test trenches to locate the buildings and define the orientation of the Asklepieion. The excavation yielded a sturdy wall whose topmost sur- face is at a depth of 0.3m-0.5m. This significant find had already been uncovered in 1963. Excavated to a length of 7.5m, the wall is oriented N-S with a slight deviation towards the W. Its S end turns forming a right-angle and continues east- wards (w. 0.8m, h. 0.9m). The stonework was careful, with small well-worked marble blocks and successive complemen- tary slabs of schist. The wall rests on an excavated bedrock of schist and an imperfectly formed euthynteria. There was a thick destruction layer containing clay Laconian-type roof- tiles, masses of crushed unbaked bricks, small stones and frag- ments of marble blocks. The building to which the wall belongs remains unidentifiable. Nevertheless, the pottery and certain small finds assign it to the LC period. Significant evi- dence supports the notion that the space was used during the</page><page sequence="76">76 DAVID BLACKMAN 128. Skopelos, Loutraki: incised plaster decoration LR and Byz times, such as scattered representative sherds, pits- apothetai filled with small items and later makeshift walls. On a smaller scale, trial trenches were also dug on the adjoining municipal plot which presented evidence for the existence of other buildings within the sanctuary area. (ADelt 365) Loutraki (Anc.Selinous). The G.Varlami plot is situated approximately in the centre of the R town of Selinous, E of the anc. acropolis and close to the M. Drosini plot (ADelt 42, 261) Due to construction work on the site, a rescue excavation was conducted and cleaning of the visible walls in the SE bor- der of the plot was undertaken. Part of a large and complex R construction was uncovered. The W part of the building was very disturbed and ruined due to the mod. road and landslides from the overlooking hill. In the E, the building continues beyond the border of the plot. It is oriented E-W and its length is over 28m, while a complete plan cannot be recorded since the building extends to the modem road and existing buildings. The N wall (w. 1m) in certain areas rests on the natural rock which has been cut to form the wall's foundation trench, according to the R opus incertum technique. Wall plaster made of lime, sand, tiles, sherds and stones has been used as a bind- ing material. The unevenness of the N wall is due to the slope of the natural rock which supports it. Parts of six rooms were uncovered (oriented N-S), all con- structed with the same method (opus incertum) and covered with mortar of the same quality. All the rooms are vaulted and comprise more than one storey at least. In the SE border of the plot the building is better preserved and the existence of a pilas- trum is observed around which rooms 4 and 5 are situated. In room 4 there is a wall (h. over 3.5m) which is arched with rows of holes for wooden beams following the R model. On the W edge of room 5, above the pilastrum, are sockets and projections which once supported a staircase, traces of which are intact on the N wall. This wall also bears a setting to support another floor. It is worth mentioning that at its highest point the wall plaster has traces of an incised linear decoration. The E end of room 5 is defined by another arched structure (room 6) which extends into the adjacent plot. In a later period, following the destruction of the building, this space was used for a child bur- ial as is verified by the tile-roofed grave (oriented NE-SW) which was found. Externally, the grave has a length of up to 0.7m and a width of 0.4m. The body is oriented W-E and its position is extended. The skeletal remains are poorly preserved and fragmentary. The only grave offering was an incised amphora fragment which dates to the mid-6th Ct AD. The pottery found indicates that the building covers the entire R period. In the LHL times it is observed that wine trans- port pottery is abundant (sharp-based amphoras of the Peparethian type I) as well as storage vessels, while domestic and food preparation pottery is less in number. Most of the pot- tery is unpainted; there are a few bg and rg vessels (of the sig- illata pergamena type) and a few examples with incised wavy decorations. A green glass oinochoe fragment, lamp fragments and Laconian-type roof-tiles were also found and are assigned to the same period. A study of the LR pottery shows that ovoid amphoras pre- dominate (perhaps a development of the Peparethian type II) which bear an incised grooved decoration (closely spaced, deep grooves created with a comb and widely spaced grooves of the same thickness). Tiles and floor bricks found, are dated to the same period. Presumptions alone can be made regarding the use of the building area, since the excavation is fragmentary. Taking into account the location of the building (centrally situated within the R town) and the type of architectural remains (arched multi-storied 'blind' structures - typical R construction of a hidden stoa) and without excluding the idea that its uppermost section was part of the aqueduct of Selinous town, one could deduce that the building constituted the commercial sector of the town; this is supported by the pottery found. A shelter was built for the preservation of the construction. On the A. Malamou plot which is situated on the W side of the anc. town of Selinous, there is a visible section of an interior room, possibly vault-roofed, which belongs to a LR building (4.25m x 3.72m). Three walls are intact: the N wall is more vis- ible (1. 2.2m, w. 0.6m, h. 2.2m) and is built with the opus incer- tum method bonded with wall plaster. Its inner surface bears lime mortar with incised dolphin designs and at the bottom are linear depictions of the sea and fish (Fig. 128). The plaster was incised with a sharp tool when still wet. The incisions are shallow and done freehand without corrections, which suggests the work of a skilled craftsman. The floor is probably situated at a lower level since the walls continue down. A rescue excavation was not car- ried out, but immediate conservation was applied to the wall. In the same area, S of the anc. building, a sarcophagus was uncovered (1. 2.1m, w. 0.9m, h. 0.9m). Its surfaces are rough- ly-worked with a chisel and there is a band on the inner edge of the rim used to secure the cover. On the longer sides the band is broken by three rectangular slots, possibly for the plac- ing of the horizontal support of its monolithic cover which was not found. Between the two bands and on all four sides of the sar- cophagus runs a simple low relief decoration. Fine garlands without plastic details form an arch on each of the short sides while there are two arches on each long side. On the crest of each arch a small rhomboid decoration is attached (h. 0.14m). In the middle of each semi-circle above the rhomboid is an undecorated disc. The arches are joined at the four comers of the sarcophagus by a shallow relief with different triangular decorations. The decoration and construction material, which is similar to granite but less hard and more fragile (lapis sar- cophagus), indicate that it belongs to the group of sarcophagi from the Asia Minor workshop of Assos dated to the 1st half of the 3rd Ct AD (ADelt 368). This is not the only instance of importation from Assos to the island of Peparethos. The above finds indicate that during R times Peparethos was a steady market for the distribution of sarcophagi from the village workshops of Assos and took part in organized sea trade with Assos at the centre and spreading to the N Aegean, the coast of Lebanon, Egypt, Sicily and the Adriatic.

Skopelos, Mavragani: ^^y|^s^t~ . ^ fortified rural dwelling 30. Skopelos, o' Elleniko: fortified · , , rural dwelling Skopelou and as a result a number of rural establishments of anc. Selinous were discovered. Following the investigation of the plateaus in the area, seven towers were discovered, some of which had already been recorded by Friedrich at the beginning of the 20th Ct, as well as three isolated sites with rural estab- lishments. The towers are 6km away from anc. Selinous. The largest tower is centrally located within the groups (Elleniko) and a network of footpaths connects the towers with the rural dwellings and the largest water source (site Livadaki) and the best anchorage (Limonari). The sites which have been investi- gated include: A fortified rural dwelling at Mavragani (Fig. 129). The core of the establishment includes a circular building whose external wall is built of local grey stone in a pseudo-isodomic style (w. im, h. 1.5-2m); E of the tower there are traces of a square courtyard. The tower is situated on a hill (N-S, 34m x E-W, 60m) and analemma walls have later been constructed with the blocks of the anc. tower. Scattered on the hill were found unpainted sherds of storage vessels for liquids and solid foodstuffs belonging to the C, HL and R periods. Another fortified rural dwelling at Elleniko, roughly 500m away from Mavragani: a circular building with a complete plan (di. 9.3m) (Fig. 130). The external wall is pseudo-isodomic (w. im, h. 2.2m). The wall has seven courses of local grey stone and its entrance (w. 1.4m) is situated in the W. There is an abundance of storage vessels dated to the C, HL, R and Med periods which indicates the diachronic use of the establish- ment. This is also verified by the coins found, which include bronze Peparethos coins (4th Ct BC and early 2nd Ct BC), a Julio-Claudian dynasty coin (1st Ct AD), a Hadrianic coin (117-138 AD), a coin ofAntoninus Pius (138-167 AD), one of Constantine II (317-392 AD) and a Byz coin dated to the 9th Ct AD. Evidence shows the establishment was occupied from the 4th Ct BC up to HL times, the main activity of the inhabitants being the production of wine and oil as indicated by the pottery found and a fragment of a stone wine-press. Evidence for the cultivation of grains is also verified by the presence of storage vessels (jars). During the 1st Ct and early 2nd Ct AD the con- tinued use and exploitation of the site is observed, reflecting the organization and engagement of space as recommended by the socio-economic Pax Romana model. During the 4th Ct AD, a period of dramatic instability and reorganization in all aspects of life, this area, paradoxically, has relations with the western empire. The anc. building material was used for the construction of recent analemma walls and huts situated around the tower. Fortified rural dwelling at Sentouka. On the site survives a tower with a rectangular plan (11 x 6m). At certain points the walls reach a height of 1.3m and are built of local grey stone (1.6 x 0.5m) but in a different manner from the above. There are analemma walls in the surrounding area built of building material from the tower. Prionas Tower. There is a circular tower on the site (di. 6m) built of schist and limestone. Agios Georgios. Situated E of the Elleniko site is a circu- lar stone construction (di. 1.8m, h. 0.5m) whose top surface is worked and has a rim with a spout for pouring wine and oil into a bucket underneath. It is supported on limestone slabs. N of the stone structure are traces of a circular stone building, pos- sibly another tower (approx. di. 7.5m) W of Limonari Bay there are traces of blocks from ruined buildings and abundant domestic pottery dated to the HL, R and Med times. N of the 7th-Ct AD monastery of Agios Taxiarchis there are traces of a circular building, possibly contemporary with the above-mentioned tower/rural dwellings. Rachi-Koniari. W of Agios Eftychios there are walls built in the polygonal style, over 2m high. Many sherds and roof- tiles were also found on the site and are dated to the HL and R times. It is not possible to deduce the use or function of these fragmentary architectural remains. Mavraki. NE of Glossa, outside the old footpath network and out of sight of the above sites, there are traces of an anc. establishment. The area has many slopes which makes it suit- able for vine cultivation. Human intervention has significantly altered the anc. landscape. The little evidence available indicates that agriculture and trade in agricultural products constituted the basic source of income for the inhabitants of Peparethos. It appears also that life was polis-oriented and in the chora of each of the three cities there existed seasonally inhabited dwellings. In anc. Selinous it is observed that as the town enlarges the number of rural dwellings increases. The towers were probably isolated fortified dwellings while the permanent dwellings were situat- ed in the town. Taking into account the width of the external walls and the plethora of re-used building material found in mod. constructions it can be assumed that the buildings had at least another floor. The towers are situated in areas where nat- ural building material is abundant. Similar fortified rural constructions are widespread in the Greek countryside during the 4th Ct BC (well-known in Attika, the Peloponnese, the Aegean and the Ionian islands) and are related to agriculture, amphora workshops (specifically for the bottling and export of local wine), marble quarries and mines.</page><page sequence="78">78 DAVID BLACKMAN The investigation up until now indicates that the rural estab- lishments reflected the typical Greek household, aiming to defend and protect the people, the animals and stored goods against invaders and pirates. Each tower serves as a place for storage and preservation of grain within the area of production and offers a solution to the distance problem created between the house proper and the farm property. (ADelt 369-72) Staphylos. A short excavation (in the area where N. Platon excavated a Myc grave) uncovered a section of a ruined wall. In a small, shallow pit, SE of the wall, miniature vessels were found dated to the beginning of the 5th Ct BC along with frag- ments of two clay tiles with representations of a horse and rider (Dioskouros perhaps?) which indicates that the space was used during C times (and possibly A times), without our knowing the purpose for which it was used. (ADelt 368) Velestino (anc. Pherai). A short investigation was carried out on account of electricity pylon installation. At a depth of 0.55m, a section of a well-built wall was uncovered (1. 5.75m, w. 0.5m, h. 0.95m) oriented E-W. The wall is made of well- worked schist and limestone bound with mud. Due to the limit- ed excavation space only the S face of the wall was uncovered, where the existence of a road surface was verified. Paved with trodden earth, gravel, broken shells and tiles, the road could well be related to an anc. road which had been investigated fur- ther E on another site and which lies in the same direction. (ADelt 38, 193) The wall and road are dated to the end of the 3rd Ct BC. In a second construction phase, dated to the 2nd Ct BC, there is continued use of the wall while two adjoining walls are built at right angles to it. Oriented N-S (1. 0.45m, w. 0.7m) and N (1. 0.15m) the walls create an inner space, the walls of which were covered in pink plaster. Fragments of a thinner, yellowish plaster were found on the floor of the initial wall at a depth of 0.76m. During preparation work for the construction of the municipal cultural centre, an excavation was undertaken on the Mnimata site situated on the limits of the SE cemetery of anc. Pherai, SE of the mod. town. The excavation uncovered three simple pit graves without offerings and with skeletal remains scattered at different points, at a depth of 0.5m. On the basis of their morphological features, the graves are dated to the late Ott period and belong to a Ch cemetery. A cist grave (2.4 x 1 x 0.82m) was also found, oriented NE-SW at a depth of 1m. The grave is built of well-worked greyish limestone slabs (0.14m thick) and was covered with two roughly-worked limestone slabs. Even though the grave had been ruined in antiquity, it contained a skeleton without offerings; its method of construction dates it to the HL period. In the course of trenching in the owner's store on the Nik. Papapostolou plot a section of a wall was uncovered at a depth of 1.7m and oriented almost N-S (1. 1.86m, w. 0.88m, h. 0.67m). The remains were greatly disturbed, mainly by mod- em intervention. Built on hard yellowish earth located at a depth of 2.6m, the wall has an euthynteria and one row of blocks (the inner sides worked with a chisel) of greenish con- glomerate stone. This sturdy wall, possibly an analemma wall, belongs to a large building and is dated to the HL period. Scarce pottery found was C and HL. In the course of widening the National Highway (Aerino- M. Monastiri sector), following a surface survey of the area in 1994, an investigation was carried out on three sites. The investigation had three approaches: the cutting of trial trench- es by excavation machinery for the location of antiquities; excavation work on known sites with anc. remains; supervision of excavation work undertaken by the contractor companies. In the district of Aerino, at a depth of 0.5m-0.75m, were uncovered sections of walls belonging to a megaron-type dwelling, oriented NW-SE. The pottery and other portable finds which were found, date the walls to LH IIIB. The remains are disturbed and contain sherds from post-Byz back to MH which clearly shows the diachronic use of the space. An investigation of a cemetery was carried out in the Agios Georgios Pheron district, where in 1989 R graves were exca- vated. Three R cist graves were uncovered (oriented E-W and NE-SW) at a depth of ca 0.4m, built with tile fragments on their inner surface. The graves are fragmentary and the skele- tal remains are totally disintegrated. (ADelt 44, 223) In the Chloe Velestinou district only trial trenches were cut under the supervision of the Ephorate. Two built vaulted graves dated to the PG period were found here. The small basketball court in the Municipal Stadium is situated SE of Velestino and is located within the SE sector of the cemetery of anc. Pherai. A rescue excavation had earlier been conducted in the area in the course of municipal con- struction work. (ADelt 37, 221) During drainage work conducted in the court area, 10 C and HL graves were uncovered (at depths of 0.3m and 0.5-1m) most of which were partly destroyed by excavation machinery. All the graves were oriented E-W with a few slight deviations and include two rectangular cist graves, a pit grave and seven clay lamakes. The cist graves (1.88 x 0.69 x 0.58m and 1.97 x 0.77 x 0.58m) were built of one-piece, well-worked slabs of hard schist and were covered with two or more cover slabs. The lamakes (1. 1.67-1.98m, w. 0.4-0.6m, d. 0.32m) were cov- ered with either simple rectangular clay slabs, clay saddled covers or Laconian-type roof-tiles. The pit grave was also cov- ered with roof-tiles. Each grave, with the exception of one cist grave, con- tained one body laid on its back with the skull facing the E. The cist grave contained a triple burial with two adults and one child. The grave offerings were few and were not present in all the graves. A bg kylix-skyphos was found in one of the cist graves and a bronze coin had been placed in the mouth of the deceased in one of the lamakes. Some (mainly bg) vessels were found outside the graves, perhaps thrown in make-shift apothetai. The evidence which came from the excavation comple- ments and supports the results of the 1982 investigation. Noteworthy is the systematic organization of the cemetery, mainly with relation to the orientation of the graves and the positioning of the bodies within them. Odos Iro6n Velestinioton Alvanikou Epous lies on the S side of the mod. town. As was already known, a section of the S wall (4th Ct BC) of the anc. town of Pherai passes along the S border of the I. Giannousi plot. Following the owner's request to construct an extension to an old dwelling, a trial excavation was carried out. The investigation uncovered a sec- tion of the exterior wall surface (1. 9m) and interior wall sur- face (12.5m) which survives up to a height of one course (0.6-0.65m) and rests on an euthynteria which is founded on the soft natural yellowish rock. It is estimated that the wall is over 3m thick. Its courses are built of the local grey limestone, while the euthynteria is constructed of slabs of the same stone and greenish schist. Between the two faces there is a fill of grey limestone breccia. It was noted that cross walls were built within the wall, 2.8m apart from each other, obviously for added strength. Certain construction details as well as artefacts from the same area suggest that W of the wall exists a tower (Figs. 132, 133).</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 79 I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I $1 0 1 131. Skopelos, Velestino site 132. Skopelos, Velestino site: detail of excavation The wall is constructed in a similar manner to that of the acropolis on the Agios Athanasios or Panagia Hill and belongs to the same construction phase of the town's fortification. (AAA 10 [1977], 174-187) Under the wall, a partly ruined Myc cist grave was found which contained a body lying in a contracted position. The grave offerings consisted of a bronze knife and a small stone whetstone. (ADelt 362-5) Velestino area. The Greek-Italian surface survey programme, which had begun in 1989 (ADelt 48, 240-3), continued during 1994 and 1995 in the wider Velestino area (anc. Pherai). SW of Mikro Perivolaki, on the Poumarorrachi and Agridi sites, scat- tered unidentifiable coarse-ware pottery was found while in the deserted old settlement of Agios Antonios (Germi) a spring was located in a gallery carved in the natural rock where an underground fountain had probably been formed in antiquity. SW of Velestino the course of the anc. roadway Velestino- Pharsala was investigated. This led from the town of Pherai to Skotousa and Pharsalo and is used nowadays as a rural road by farmers. It is at least 2.5m wide and parts of it are stone-paved while many sections are visible where cultivation proved to be impossible. The Aerino valley was again investigated without signifi- cant results, following evidence from previous investigations for the possible location of new sites with antiquities. N and NE of Velestino, the most significant PR settlements which were investigated include Magoula Deli-Hani, Agios Athanasios Hill, Magoula Hatzimisiotiki, Magoula Visviki and the site NNW of Magoula on which stand the remains of a Byz naiskos. The investigation confirmed the presence of a number of small settlements or other types of establishments mainly belonging to the LHL and ER period which corre- sponds to the desertion of the anc. town of Pherai at that time. (ADelt 373-4) Volos Museum. A map archive was developed in order to doc- ument all proclaimed archaeological sites belonging to the nomes of Magnesia, Karditsa and the Sporades. Storage spaces have been refurbished and the artefacts have been rearranged and recorded on computer. PHTHIOTIS Achinos. Part of the W cemetery of the anc. town was unearthed in the Armyriotes plot, containing a total of 18 graves (1 cist-tomb, 2 chamber tombs, 1 simple inhumation, 1 burial in the dromos of a chamber tomb, 1 tile-roofed, hut-shaped tomb, and 12 rectangular pits), dating from the 4th to the 2nd Ct BC, the majority of the 2nd Ct BC. (ADelt 344-5) Amphikleia. ESE of the town at the site of Teiche on the S slope of the hill, three chamber tombs of LMyc date were investigated. All three had irregular, rectangular chambers, with rounded comers, and an entrance on the S, to which led a short dromos. The entrance of two of the tombs was blocked by an irregular slab, while the only example with a preserved roof was of a hemispherical form. The tombs were used from the mid-LH IIIC to the SMyc period. (ADelt 342-3) The small church of Agia Ierousalem in a cave on Mt Parassos is identified with a Crusader structure of the marquisate of Bodonitsa (1204-1410). The church is excep- tionally well built with stone blocks and ogee window open- ings. Wall-paintings inside are dated to the 17th Ct. (ADelt 397-8) Arkitsa, Agia Aikaterine. Excavations were undertaken to uncover the atrium of the well-known basilica at Daphnousia, Lokris (A. Orlandos, Byzantion 5 [1929], 207-28). The atrium consisted of three stoas, a monumental propylon and four ancillary rooms along its S side. An ovoid baptismal font was found built into the floor of the westernmost of these rooms. Entrance from the atrium to the narthex took place via two openings along the axis of the side aisles. A fountain / well existed in the centre of the atrium. A follis of Justinian I (539 AD) was found in the N room, together with an African style lamp with an animal relief. The mosaic floor of the W stoa included the inscription: FEPONTIOC / YIIEP EYXHC E/AYTOY KE IANTOC / TOY OIKOY AYTOY E/KAAAIEPFHC EN / TO EPFON TOY/TO. An undisturbed destruction layer (with no traces of fire) covered the remains. Part of the fill on top of that layer appears to have come from the original excavation of the nave, and included an African style lamp with an imperial bust. (ADelt 403-05) E Byz building remains discovered 50m NW of the site included wall remains and coins of Justinian I to Justin II. An ECh bathhouse was uncovered 150m to the W of the site.

Anc. building remains, including a cylindrical ter- racotta drain of LHL date, part of a stone-built cistern of LR date, coated with water-proof plaster, and a circular well to the NE, later used as an apothetes (HL-R), were recorded at the junction of Odos Oileos and Androutsou. In Odos Eleutheriou Venizelou were excavated architectural remains of a HL building (3rd Ct BC), below the better-preserved remains of five rooms, which were built over the levelled destruction deposits of the earlier structure. The preserved floor surfaces included plaster floors over a trodden earth layer, and one room with a mosaic floor, decorated with geo- metric motifs; the thresholds were of marble. The remains of a Byz storeroom and part of a wall were recorded in Odos 25es Martiou, and on the coastal road from Atalante to Skala, respectively. Finally, a tile-roofed grave and a pot burial, dat- ing from the 2nd half of the 1 t Ct BC, were discovered at the site of Scholia. (ADelt 335-8) Glypha. During the excavation of tumulus B four rock-cut pit- graves were investigated, but similar tombs were also recorded outside the limits of the tumulus. Between the two tumuli, the area was used only in the ECh period. (ADelt 340) Halai. John E. Coleman (ASCS) reports on the 2000 season: 'The summer of 2000 was largely taken up with N remains from the acropolis of Halai. Study continued on the architec- tural and stratigraphic record in area F and on pottery, lithics and animal bones found in N levels. It now seems likely that the settlement at Halai was founded in the MN period and not the EN, as we had earlier suggested as a possibility. Architectural remains dating to the MN period can now be assigned to at least four different buildings of rectangular or sub-rectangular plan, one subdivided into three rooms, the oth- ers with at least one internal spur wall or buttress. Similar but more fragmentary buildings of the first stage of the LN period suggest that the architectural tradition continued without change. Backfilling also continued at the centre and the SE end of the site in accordance with our conservation plan, approved by the Archaeological Service in 1994. We also continued the study of BA and later finds from the islet of Mitrou, collected during our surface survey operations in 1988 and 1989.' Kalapodi. On Kastro hill, at the site of a MH settlement were unearthed four cist-tombs, also of MH date. (ADelt 338-9) Kalyvia. A single tile-roofed, hut-shaped tomb, part of an anc.cemetery, was excavated at the site of Kalyvia Lamias. (ADelt 340) Kolaka (Kyrtone). In the Myc cemetery at the site of Ai- Giannes one more chamber tomb, of LH IIIB1-2 date, was investigated; it belongs to a group of tombs, located to the W, and continues the southern row. Like them, it had a long dro- mos, leading to a rectangular entrance through the S wall of the grave. The chamber, of irregular square shape with rounded corers, also contained a small rectangular pit in the SW cor- ner, but the entrance was blocked with a dry stone wall. (ADelt 341) Kynos. During restoration work on the LH buildings and the HL fortification wall, a hearth and a drain of LH IIIC date were revealed, in the NW comer of the site, while for the first time evidence was found of a PG occupation phase on the hill, associated with poorly preserved building remains. (ADelt 338-9) Lamia. In 1995, 23 rescue excavations were carried out in the mod. town, the overwhelming majority consisting of funerary and domestic remains of the C, HL and R periods. Among the architectural remains, at the junction of Odos Drosopoulou and Patroklou were excavated parts of two anc. buildings, with two construction phases, one of the EHL peri- od (late 4th/early 3rd Ct BC), the other of the LR era; the build- ings were still in use in LByz times. Between the two buildings was found an anc. road, 2.50m wide, to which led a drain, com- ing from the second building to the S; the latter, which has been identified as a public building, consisted of four rooms. The remains of another public building, a gymnasium, erected in the mid-4th Ct BC, and used until the 3rd Ct BC, when it was destroyed by an earthquake, were located at the junction of Odos Thermopylon and Miaoule. Sections of the anc. fortifica- tions were identified at the junction of Odos Achileos and Vasakare, and in Odos Rozake Angele. A section of a HL road, associated with part of a stone-built drain, was found at the junction of Odos Ainianon and Makropoulou, while in Odos Athan. Diakou were located part of a HL public building (wall) and a row of five tombs (2 cists, 3 tile-roofed, hut-shaped graves), and an apothetes of Byz/post-Byz date. Finally, a sub- terranean cistern and eight Byz apothetai, were identified at the junction of Odos Leonidou and Patroklou, and in Odos Esaia, respectively. Fragmentary walls of different periods were located in various parts of the mod. town, including Odos Karaiskake, Odos Ainianon (R date), at the junction of Odos Ekklesion and Levaditou, at the Plateia Palaiou Demarchiou (Byz/post-Byz), and at the junction of odos Ainianon and Makropoulou. As regards funerary remains, in Odos Thermopylon was excavated the only specimen of a Macedonian-type built tomb, which has been found in Lamia. It had a rectangular plan, with stone-built walls, and with an entrance and a short dromos on the S. Inside the chamber were found stone-built couches, coat- ed with red plaster; the same material lined the walls and the floor of the entrance. The tomb was erected in the late 3rd/ early 2nd Ct BC and continued to be used until the 4th Ct AD. At the site of Galaneika, on the N slopes of Lamia hill, were discovered two cist-tombs of the 9th Ct BC, which, judg- ing by the existence of a row of 11 other such tombs ca 2km to the N, might be evidence for a settlement of this date in the area. In Odos Grevenon, on the SW slopes of Lamia hill, three cist-tombs of the mid-4th Ct BC were unearthed, possibly part of a SW cemetery of LC-EHL date. A section of the N ceme- tery of the anc. town was discovered in Odos Achaion, includ- ing 11 rectangular pit-graves, six tile-roofed, hut-shaped tombs and one rock-cut grave, dating from the 4th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct BC. At the junction of Odos Achaion and Poseidonos, part of the W cemetery of the anc. town was excavated, including two cist-tombs and pit-graves, dating from the 4th/early 3rd Ct BC. Part of the SE cemetery of anc. Lamia, including two tile- roofed, hut-shaped tombs and three cists, dating from the 4th Ct BC to the 2nd Ct BC, was excavated in Odos Pipinou. Finally, E of Odos Tanagras were recorded ten tombs: three tile-roofed, hut-shaped, of the R period, five cist tombs of the end of the G period, and one burial pithos; while architectural remains in the area of the SE HL cemetery, just outside the city walls, were identified at the junction of Odos Thermopylon and Palaiologou. (ADelt 321-33) Livanates. The remains of 4th-Ct AD buildings were recorded on the coast at Livanates, including five rooms roofed with Laconian-type tiles. In one of the rooms, possibly a cistern, a small part of a terracotta slab floor and a cylindrical terracotta drain were preserved. (ADelt 340-1)</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 81 Malesina. At the site of Ag. Ioannes Theologos, 190m E of the archaeological site of the acropolis of Halai, 26 tombs were excavated, probably part of the E cemetery partly excavated by Goldman (Hesperia 11 [1942], 365 ff.). The majority of the tombs were pits (21), one a cist-tomb, and one was a poros sar- cophagus. The cemetery was used for a long period, from the end of the 3rd Ct BC to the 1St Ct AD. (ADelt 333-5) Modi. Two more chamber tombs of LH IIIB date were exca- vated in the Liarakes plot. Each had a long dromos, leading to an entrance in the S side of the tomb, blocked with a dry stone wall, while the chambers had a circular shape. In the dromos of one of the tombs a roofed pit was found which contained bones and funeral offerings, while on the floor of the chamber of the other tomb were found three skeletons in a contracted position; in the NW part of this chamber were also found the remains of an earlier burial, separated by a line of unworked stones. (ADelt 343-4) Palaiochori. A number of anc. sites were discovered during completion of the natural gas pipeline across Phthiotis. At the site of Paleovryse, two cist-tombs and a row of five G pithos-burials were excavated. Building remains of R date were located lkm SE of the G cemetery, including fragmen- tary walls of a house or farm, a room of which was laid with square terracotta slabs, possibly a cistern; to the N of this were excavated two tile-roofed graves of children. The S part of another R building or farm was excavated 3km to the E of the first, containing three rooms in the centre of one of which was incorporated a square stone-built structure, possi- bly a bench or platform. By the S wall of another room, to the E, was recorded a rectangular structure built of upright tiles, probably a hearth, which contained small stones, an upright terracotta slab and traces of fire. In the trodden earth floors of the end rooms were found many storage pithoi, which suggests that they were used as storerooms. To the N of the central room were discovered the remains of a small cistern. At the site of Vrilia a row of tombs was recorded, part of a hitherto unknown cemetery of the A-C period (5th Ct-lst half of 4th Ct BC), containing 17 graves (3 pit-graves, 2 pithos burials, 2 poros sarcophagi and the rest cists). (ADelt 345-8) Sphaka. After a fire in a public forest area, at the 19th km of the local road from Atalante to Elateia, building remains of the mid-3rd/early 2nd Ct BC were revealed, forming a square stone- built structure (9 x 9m) divided internally into two rooms, one of which, to the N, was roofed (Laconian tiles). Outside the building were located two other walls, forming an angle. It seems that it should be associated with fortification works, guarding the road from Elateia to Abai and Hyampolis. (ADelt 341-2) Stylis. Remains of C buildings were discovered in three rescue excavations in the mod. town, identified with anc. Phalara. In Odos Diolete were recorded ground-floor rooms of buildings, dating from the first half of the 4th Ct until the early 3rd Ct BC. In Odos Alamanas two connecting rooms were located, part of a house also identified in a neighbouring plot, while the asso- ciated pottery belonged to the C-R periods. Finally, remains of a room of the 4th Ct BC were excavated at the junction of Odos Kapodistriou and Platonos. (ADelt 339-40) Ypate. Two half-destroyed tombs, one cist and one irregular pit, were recorded at the site of Skylabela. (ADelt 340) NORTHERN THESSALY Kalambaka. Theopetra Cave. N. Kyparissi-Apostolika reports on the ninth season of excavation in 1994. The two aims were to investigate the N levels and look for underlying Mes levels, and to continue excavation of deep Pal deposits. To achieve the first aim seven trenches were opened on the W side of the cave; all produced N deposits, and four had underlying Mes deposits, two with strong traces of burning (two near the cave entrance had no Mes deposits, and one was not excavated below the N level). Excavation continued in five trenches which had already reached UPal levels. Three more 'structures' were found similar to one already found in Z11; red and black layers indicated that they were hearths belonging to a relatively warm period (C14 dating: 25,000 BP), each overlying a deposit belonging to the final cold period of the Pleistocene. (ADelt 831-2 and fig. 1) In 1999 excavation was completed of the Mes and late UPal levels down to the level of the surface of the last Ice Age. (Epyov YHHO 3, 171) Larisa. Town. Sections of the ECh fortification walls were uncovered on Odos Lapithion 18. A square tower added to the walls at a later date appears to be associated with Justinian I's repair of the walls following the damage sustained during Theoderic's attack in 482 AD (ADelt 398-9). On the junction of Neophytou and Palamas streets, further evidence was dis- covered for a large LR / ECh structure with mosaic floor, first reported in ADelt 32, 136. New Archaeological Museum. Twenty years after the ces- sion of land by the municipality of Larisa (Mezourlo site) plans got underway for the construction of the new Archaeological Museum of Larisa. Instigated by the Ephorate and the Ministry's Museum Studies Directorate, another 44 stremmata were added to the initial plot of 10 stremmata. The total area of the complex will cover an estimated 12,200m2, rendering it (together with the Museum of Byzantine Civilization in Thessalonike) one of the two largest museums in Greece, out- side of Athens (ADelt 387). Apart from the main exhibition area, the museum will also house a small amphitheatre, a multi-purpose hall (for temporary exhibitions, lectures and other presentations) and an audiovisual room where the visitor can be informed prior to entering the exhibition area. The offices of the EPCA and EBA will also be housed in the complex. In view of the construction of the new museum, the Ephorate made an appeal to private collectors and holders of antiquities to hand in artefacts, the most significant of which would be exhibited. Hundreds of finds from different sites in Thessaly were handed in, mainly consisting of PR objects (anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, stone and bone tools, models of houses, stamps and various miniature objects), as well as finds dated to historical times. Noteworthy is the rf bell-shaped krater from Gyrtoni dated to the 4th Ct BC. (ADelt 390 and pls. 131-2) Ancient theatre. One of the aims of the Ephorate ever since its foundation was to undertake the arduous and costly task of uncovering the anc. theatre of Larisa, one of the most significant monuments in anc. Thessaly, situated underneath mod. constructions in the town's centre. After a struggle of over 15 years, the first mass expropriation of nine properties was completed, as well as the demolition of the buildings on them. (ADelt 35, 275; 38, 199-201; 40, 200-02; 42, 274; 48, 259-60) Sections of the ten topmost rows of the cavea were uncovered as far as the upper diazoma and it was verified that the epitheatre is not intact (Fig. 133).

Larisa: tombs in the ancient theatre site</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 83 135. Thessalonike: ancient agora and Ott pits were also found and tests clarified construction details. There was an effort, for instance, to trace the NW cor- ner of room 7; a pipe was demolished in order to reveal the floor of the orchestra of the 'bouleuterion'; part of the outer ring of the odeion's second phase was unearthed and traces of the central rectangular pillar were found in the junction between the inner colonnade of the S stoa and the outer colon- nade of the E stoa. A stone base (E-W) on either side, extend- ing the line of the inner colonnade of the S stoa, presumably supported the thresholds leading from the S to the stoas. Finally, a pit between the 26th and the 27th pillar of the crypto- porticus' S wall was demolished, in order to restore the S wall of the stoa. A built drain runs N-S along the building's E wing, goes beneath the mosaics to the S, and meets the pipe beneath the stone-paved 'commercial' road S of the workshops of the cryptoporticus area. At the same time a test at the commercial road was intended to reveal the construction details of the drain running beneath it. (ADelt 451-3) Restorations in 1995 focused at the area of the odeion, of the cryptoporticus and of the S krepis (ADelt 493-4). Complementary excavations conducted during restoration work in 1999 at the anc. agora brought to light earlier con- struction phases. A building complex of the Imperial period with cisterns, and a building phase of the 3rd and 2nd Ct BC with indications of a sculpture workshop, were i ' 't t.'identified. -37;^ 3Q^ AEMTH 11, 351-64 reports on the LH bath- - rl house found in the agora (furnace, swimming pool -' i l&gt; and semi-circular room with bathing basins).

The 6 m-wide 1f l-: 1 ancient road near Odos I. Dragoumi was one of the -, Vt main roads of the road network of the polis. A pub- &lt;^^^ lic building at least 40m wide and ca 50m long "-2j-:.i^ occupied the building block E of the road.

The open peristyle (24 x 12m) Z'p- ~"'; :t jon the E side, with an excellently- preserved floor made of hexagonal baked plinthoi, is identified as an administrative and juridical meeting place. The fresco fragments with galloping horses confirm the monumental nature of this LHL-R building. The ; :K - , - Byz excavation covers the larger part of the N stoa, along with the NE part of the excavation area. - r 1i The building block is naturally arranged around s the peristyle and, presumably, around a monumen- 5; .; ,tal entrance. All 12 rooms around the S and W stoa f j&lt; ^ | are connected with the peristyle; the five W rooms communicate only with the anc. road and three of these contained storage pots with carbonized plant remains. A dense destruction layer with melted bricks, roof timber and tiles, potsherds and wall plaster, covers the whole building, and traces of fire occur in certain areas. Prof. B. Papazachos assigns the destruction of the probably two-floor building on the E side to an earthquake. The 1St Ct BC-mid-2nd Ct AD finds include a marble head of Aphrodite (1St Ct BC), a marble head of a child (1st Ct BC- st Ct AD), an inscription fragment bearing the name IABINA (1st Ct AD), figurines of Kybele and Athena stamped by local workshops, lamps, coins of Hadrian (117-138 AD) and pseudoautonomous coin issues of Thessalonike, arretine vases, etc. One may identify (at least a large part of) an extensive LHL construction, i.e. the substructure of the main public building, and also the earlier HL sections of the substructure of the Dioiketerion and an obvious destruction level. The finds are dated from the foundation of the polis (end 4th Ct BC) through to the 2nd Ct BC; the abundant pottery of good quality (relief vases, 'West Slope' pottery) indicates relations between the polis and Athenian and Macedonian pottery centres. (ADelt 453-6) The archaeological site of the Dioiketeriou Square was finalized in 1999 and it was decided to present the antiquities in a covered area and to restore the original square. Arch of Galerius. In 1995 work continued on the cleaning, conservation and planning of this monument (Fig. 136) (ADelt 494-5). Cleaning and restoration work were completed at the end of 1999 and the monument was made available for public visits. Palace of Galerius (AR 1999-2000, 77). Excavations at the palace complex of Galerius started at the N stoa (after the detachment of the mosaic floor for conservation), at the atrium</page><page sequence="84">84 DAVID BLACKMAN 136. Thessalonike: Arch of Galerius 137. Thessalonike, Palace of Galerius: kiln and anteroom 138. Thessalonike, Palace of Galerius: lamps and at the antechamber of the octagon. M. Karamperi and E. Chrystodoulidou report that tests on the W and central part of the N corridor revealed a dense destruction level including burning and charcoal, fresco and mosaic fragments and tile remains. At a depth of 1-1.50m were traced lime plaster and clay floors with heavy subsidence, and rubble masonry wall sections. In 1995 the interior of the leaf-shaped kiln with an ante- room was explored: this had been traced in 1993 and was pre- sumably associated with a late HL metal workshop (with a cluster of courtyards formed on the ground around the ante- room, and various fragments of moulds with traces of bronze in the interior) (Fig. 137). The atrium (and the surrounding rooms) and the interior of the octagon share the same strati- graphy. The 2nd Ct BC-1st Ct AD finds include bg sherds with impressed and painted decoration, grey lamps (Fig. 138), lamps imported from Italy and Asia Minor dated to the 1St Ct AD, arretine stamps in planta pedis of the time of Tiberius, smaller objects made of bone, fragments of figurines dating to the 2nd-1st Cts BC, anonymous coin issues of Thessalonike, Amphipolis and Pella and pseudoautonomous issues of Thessalonike, plus a 1S-2nd Ct AD hoard of silver coins. The floor of the Byz cistern came into light in the antecham- ber of the octagon, which had been turned into a cistern. A later wall was unearthed at the S end of the antechamber, based on a solid stylobate, 3m wide. Two monolithic, green granite pil- lars were found in the foundations of an adjacent building; an entrance lay at the S end of the antechamber, revealing thus the connection between the antechamber and the N stoa of the large S peristyle of the building block. (ADelt 456-7) Excavations and more theoretical aspects of the investiga- tions into the N peristyle and adjacent areas of the palace of Galerius appear in AEMTH 11, 401-418, including a useful brief analysis of the bricks and masonry. AEMTH 11, 393-400 summarizes the recent work done on the whole complex, with particular reference to the organic association of the octagon building with the palace and the elliptical antechamber, which appears to have had direct access to the harbour facilities. Subjacent remains included those of luxurious R (1St3rd Ct) houses with marble and mosaic floors, which appear to have been destroyed by fire.</page><page sequence="85">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 85 Found under the latter remains were the ruins of work- shops and kilns for pottery, bone, shell and metal work (includ- ing a kiln for the production of casts, along with many cast fragments). Important R pottery (some stamped with names of the potter) and coin finds were uncovered from adjacent sites. Further work in the area is reported in AEMTH 12, 103-12, and it is suggested that a luxurious official residence previous- ly stood on the site of the palace (mosaic of hare-skins against a purple ground, coins of the 1St and 2nd Pythian games, and a hoard of 35 denarii of the 1St-2nd Ct). Inscriptions were also found mentioning the 'splendid consul' Silvanus Nicolaus II. The basilica of the same palace complex is discussed in AEMTH 12, 113-26: it was a single-aisle single-apse structure (24 x 67m); the nearest parallel known for the main structure is the Constantinian basilica in Trier. Ph. Athanassiou, B. Malama, M. Miza and M. Sarantidou report on the methodology of restoration of the early 4th-Ct AD palace complex of Galerius. This comprised the arch of Galerius, the hippodrome and the palace, which is partly pre- served at Navarinou Square. The restoration of the central sec- tion of the palace complex started in 1996 and by 1999 work will be completed on three monuments: the central section, the two-floor building, and the basilica. Restoration work is aimed at protecting the masonry and the ancient floors and at render- ing them available to the public. The main lines followed in the restoration may be summarized in the following: non-hypo- thetical restoration, completion of the gaps with compatible materials which will not affect the ancient ones, the ability of non-specialists to distinguish the restoration, allowing for changes in the restoration in the future. Finally, the linear and pictorial restoration of the broken floors was preferred for the mosaics. (AEMTH 12, 127-40). Restoration of the floors was continued in 1999 in the N and E stoa of the Eastern Galerius complex, in the Northern peristyle. The reconstruction of the basilica and of the baths of the complex was also completed. Byzantine Thessalonike. Extensive reports can be found in ADelt 515-40; only a brief overview is supplied here. Excavations on the heptapyrgon may have uncovered part of the Byz guardhouse that predated the triangular NW tower 1I4. Two stairways were reopened on the south face of NE tower 112 after having been blocked by cement for many decades. A cistern was cleared out from the ground floor level. The small towers 116 and 117 were cleared of fill. Fill was also removed from the battlement terraces, going S from I 10 to 112. No trace of anc. remains have been found as yet in the enclosure yard. (Delt 515-6). S of the heptapyrgon are the remains of the acropolis basilica which was partially examined during the Second World War by S. Pelekanides. The monument was lost to scholarship for many decades, and it was not even sure whether it was a secular or ecclesiastical structure. Surviving information indicates an opulent building, which may have had Byz wall-paintings, but was of ECh date. Digging began in a series of disused vegetable gardens, and uncovered stout LR walls and a mosaic floor, on top of which later walls had been built. Below the mosaic floor were rows of spaciously built vaulted tombs. The building appears to have been very large, but now is much destroyed. Trial trenches failed to provide fur- ther evidence, and the structure appears to have been confined only to the higher N slope. Work continues. (ADelt 516-7) Plateia Dioiketeriou. Mud-built walls of the MByz period (coins of Leo IV) were encountered on top of the ruins of a glass workshop preserved with the foundation of its kiln (6th to 10th Ct?). Magnetic examination of the material established a date of ca 820-70. Remains of other structures associated with the workshop were discovered and a large dump with lumps of unprocessed glass and damaged items was found. Below the workshop, parts of two 5th-Ct halls with mosaic floors (geo- metric design) were discovered, other sections of which are known from previous excavations. (ADelt 518-20) Remains of a large R structure with paved and mosaic floors came to light in excavations on the junction of P. Mela and D. Gounare streets; this structure may have served as part of the harbour installations. A second ECh phase (4th-5th Ct) contains walls that extend into neighbouring plots of land. This, too, may be associated with the sea-wall fortifications. Part of the sea wall leading to the White Tower was found on Gounare 4 (ADelt 520). A further part of the sea walls was uncovered along with LR wall remains on Odos Frangkon 12. (ADelt 521-2) Excavations on Agias Sophias 75 provided further evi- dence for a large 4th-5th Ct building constructed on the ruins of an earlier 2nd-3rd Ct structure. Coins from the 4th to the 6th Ct were found, along with a statera with lead counterweight with the capacity of weighing 46 pounds (see report by M. Karydas in Museum of Byzantine Culture 5 [1998]). Part of the anc. hippodrome may have been uncovered in the area around the church of the Nea Panagia. The remains described (ADelt 523-4) may represent development of the seating area at the SW part of the sphendone. On 20 Odos Margaropoulou, 152 burials of all types were investigated; they appear to date to the 3rd and 4th Cts. When the site was abandoned in the 5th Ct, it was filled and a church was later erected thereon (three-aisle basilica with single bema apse). (Delt 527-30). Excavations at the comer of Iasonidou and Arrianou Sts uncovered extensive remains of an opulent ECh building. Possibly an ecclesiastical building, the structure may be asso- ciated with the remains of an ECh basilica uncovered under the nearby 14th-Ct church of Agios Panteleimon. Rich use of opus sectile and mosaic floors and marble revetments characterized the structure. Mosaic decoration in arch soffits was also found. The building appears to have been in use from the 5th Ct to the MByz period. (ADelt 530-4) Remains of two ECh structures (cistern and tomb monu- ment) were discovered in the N section of the Evangelistrias cemetery. The cruciform tomb monument (11.95 x 8.40m) contained a row of eight burials along the W side. The cross arms may have been vaulted, while the central space may have been covered with a cupola resting on four columns. An antechamber exists to the S (w. 5.40m, 1. 14.30m), which com- municated with an opening in the middle of the S cross arm. The building was destroyed at some stage and later was reused as a workshop of some kind (remains of an adjacent cistern were found). Vaulted tombs were found in the immediate vicinity, and were decorated with crosses and foliate motifs. A further group of ten vaulted tombs was found 8m NW of the monument. The evidence points to a 6th-Ct date for the funer- ary structures. (Delt 534-5). A report is provided on investigation of the immediate area around the church of the Agioi Apostoloi (ADelt 538-40). This included excavation of the base of the R wall in the area, the monastery's cistern and associated structures. Finds included LByz lamps and marble reliefs, and a very important group of pottery of the 13th14th Ct, some of it luxury glazed ware (102 recorded items) imported from the imperial workshops of Constantinople and encountered for the first time in Thessalonike. Local wares are also handsomely represented. Building plots. At Gregoriou Palama 8 (AR 1999-2000, 78, AEMTH 9, 233-8), E. Lambrothanassi excavated LR-ECh</page><page sequence="86">86 DAVID BLACKMAN remains in a plot of 50m2 and at a depth of 6m from the level of the current road. Part of an important ER two-room building with mosaic floors was unearthed. The W room mosaic is black and white with a geometric decoration, made of rectangular marble tesserae: a wide white zone with small rhomboid deco- ration, framed by black rhomboi with a dentate outline on a white background. The E mosaic, of which one quarter remains, was made of rectangular marble tesserae of four dif- ferent sizes and bore a Dionysiac theme. During the building's second phase (end of the 5th-early 6th Ct AD), a rubble mason- ry wall was constructed alongside Gr. Palama; it was later fin- ished with plinthoi and functioned as a stylobate for marble pil- lars. A floor of marble slabs with a mortar and stone fragment bedding also survives from this period, along with few corrod- ed bronze coins. (ADelt 457-8) E. Marki reports on the surviving part of the mosaic floor of a triclinium, which belongs to the 12th villa with a triclini- um found in Thessalonike. The theme of the mosaic is a com- position of octagons enclosing circles, which contain square lozenges. Parts of the E border and the motifs in some of the octagons have apparently been repaired. A central square is surrounded by a chain-like interlacing design, within which are inscribed two concentric circles decorated with a succession of triangles. The rays, along with the traces of a braided wreath, indicate that the first circle housed traces of a braided wreath inscribed in a second circle carrying the signs of the zodiac without surrounds: a fish, a ram and a bull survive. The corers of the central square were ornamented with a kantharos with scrolled handles, flanked with two birds. Personifications of the months and the winds, of different artistic quality, since they were executed by different hands, occupy the first row of octagons around the central motif of the sun, in a white ground of marble tesserae: personifications of January, February and March (and the east wind?) are depicted along the N side; April and May along the E side; the outline and inscription of June, followed by a personification of the south wind, July, August, September (and the west wind?) along the S side; October, November, December (and the N wind?) along the W side. A coin of Honorius (393-423) found in the substratum dates the mosaic to the first half of the 5th Ct. This is the first time this theme, popular in antiquity, occurs in Thessalonike, where the tendency for mosaics featuring human figures was replaced by one favouring geometrical patterns. The theme, possibly selected by the Eparch of Thessalonike, symbolizes the protec- tion offered by Christ to the owner of the house throughout the year and in all weathers. (AEMTH 12, 141-50) D. Makropoulou reports on an unknown rectangular E-W Ottoman bath divided into three adjoining rectangular cham- bers on Iokastis Street in the upper town in Thessalonike: the bath lies in the Moslem quarter around the Imaret of Ishak Pasha, with approximately 160 Moslem inhabitants, which replaced the Byz district of the Asomatoi. As a double-bath existed in Theotokopoulou Street at the same period, it is uncertain whether the bath in Iokastis St. was also a public bath, or for use by a single sex or whether it formed part of the private villa of an Ott official. (AEMTH 12, 165-180) Rescue excavations (AEMTH 11, 429-38) in the Agia Triada area (E cemetery) uncovered vaulted ECh tombs with evidence of funerary feasts, and remains of cisterns. Some of the vaulted tombs were decorated with elaborated painted crosses. Evidence for building activity in the boom period during Galerius' reign is provided in AEMTH 11, 439-53, where a number of sites excavated SW of the Rotonda are discussed. Used as a cemetery and workshops up till the mid-3rd Ct, the area was redeveloped in the Galerian period on the Hippo- damean grid plan. Earthquake destruction in the later 4th Ct led to impressive rebuilding during the period up to the 6th Ct before the decline of the 7th. Evidence for the monastery asso- ciated with the church of St. Panteleimon and glazed pottery workshops from the LByz period were discovered. An impor- tant and hitherto unnoticed road was discovered, apparently leading to the unpublished ancient structure on Ioannou Mihail St. If this is so, it would have passed the palace, and served as a link between the latter complex and the dwellings of the citizens. Remains of a MByz monastery on 6 Thisseos St are dis- cussed in AEMTH 12, 151-164. Built on the remains of the LH and ECh periods, the monastery utilized an older structure for its church, carving an apse out of the natural rock. Ruined or destroyed by LByz times, the site was replaced by workshops. Monasteries appeared in the otherwise sparsely populated MByz town to utilise the available space following the decline of the anc. city and the protection afforded by the walls. A useful overview of data from LByz burials is presented in AEMTH 12, 183-194. LByz cemeteries at 4 Lambousiadou St and 95 Olymbiados St are discussed. The latter site includ- ed the remains of a small church. Toumba K. Soueref reports that the fill and sparse LBA and EIA remains, followed by coherent construction phases of the 6th and 5th Cts BC, found in the 1998 excavation on Dryos Street, to the S of the table at Toumba, demonstrate the continued inhabitation of the site. The large 6th-Ct BC storage area with jars, in particular, favours its identification as a private house. Bf Attic sherds and the architectural remains indicate the inte- gration of the site in an organized group of settlements during the 5th Ct BC. The sites excavated to the SE of the anc. settle- ment in the anc. cemetery at Toumba revealed 41 A graves. (AEMTH 12, 195-204) K. Soueref and K. Havela report on a villa rustica excavat- ed in 1998 in Toumba, i.e. a R farmhouse simple in design, with a storage area, working areas and storage-rooms. The villa rustica must have been inhabited between Gordian III (238-244 AD) and Philip I (244-249 AD). (AEMTH 12, 205-16) At Toumba-Kalabryton 19, in the E part of the ancient settlement, K. Soueref excavated a silo 0.35m deep (upper di. 1.43m, lower di. 1.15m) that was abandoned during the EA period because of the construction of a road 2m wide between the settlement and the hill, which made redundant the storage rooms in the above-mentioned area. (ADelt 458) At Toumba-Lotou 11-13, K. Soueref explored the central and W section of the so-called 'kitchen' ('mageireio'), which was probably abandoned after the early 4th Ct BC, on the basis of the imported Attic pottery. Part of an amphora and a bg kan- tharos with a ribbed body, mended with three leaden links and with a hole in the base were found at the site's W section, at the so-called 'andron'; they date to 350-300 BC. Beneath the last construction level (4th Ct BC), an inverted amphora and two ovoid pithoi with a stone lid were found respectively in the central and western part of the site, presumably storing liquids. The plinthoi and the many small stones found in the centre and E of the plot confirm that this area was inhabited during the EIA. (ADelt 458) At Toumba-Euagora 24, Ag. Marinas 12-14, Sphakterias 7: in 1995 investigation into 17 pit graves at Euagora 24 threw light on the G and A cemetery. 10 tombs were excavated at Ag. Marinas 12-14, including 6 pit graves, 1 stone slab cist grave for a child and two destroyed ones. Finally, 2 pit graves and remains of 2 other graves were inves-</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 87 tigated at Sphakterias 7. We may now assume that the cemetery developed from SE to S in relation to the main settlement and that the burials were placed either in the rock or in the ground. Movable finds including EIA pottery above the graves at Ag. Marinas 12-14 may have been transferred into the area by water currents. (ADelt 458) E. Doulgeri reports on the pipes found in rescue excava- tions in 1998 at Byzantine Sedes, hosting settlements of the most distinguished monasteries of Thessalonike and of the Holy Mountain (Mt Athos): the parts of two pipes found at Toumba and Therme are parts of aqueducts bringing water into Thessalonike and into settlements to the E of Thessalonike respectively. The absence of evidence does not allow us to argue that the two pipes are related to each other, even though they are similar in construction. (AEMTH 12, 217-22) Nome of Thessalonike Rescue excavations in 1999. Work at Toumba revealed an A workshop, and a storage-room with pithoi dated to the 5th Ct BC. The cemetery of the ancient settlement brought to light EIA, A and EC graves. At the settlement Phoenix, in the area of the Macedonian tomb, 57 graves dated between the early 4th and the early 3rd century were found. At Stavroupoli habita- tion levels were excavated at a N settlement. The cemetery of the historical settlement of 'Table of Lebet' yielded 30 IA graves. At Polichne were found 70 A, C and HL graves. Part of a building dated to the late 4th-early 5th Ct AD was excavat- ed in Eukarpia, and 51 IA tombs forming part of the cemetery of a hitherto unknown anc. settlement were found. At the ancient cemetery of Therme, 544 tombs, dated between the IA and the 4th Ct BC and from the HL through to the ER period, were excavated. A fragmentarily-preserved building of the 4th Ct BC and the stone-built wall of a fortification trench at the W side of the Trapeza hill of the ancient settlement are equally significant. Eight tombs with rich finds dated to the late 6th-early 5th Ct and to the 4th Ct BC were unearthed at the set- tlement Sourote of the Deme of Basilica. They belong to a large cemetery of an important anc. settlement in the area where anc. Anthemous is sought. The 83 tombs excavated at Lagyna, dated between the 4th Ct BC and the 2nd Ct AD, form part of the cemetery of anc. Lete. In the area of Sindos, 26 R tombs were excavated; 2 C tombs were found at Neochorouda, and small-scale excavations in Nea Chalkedona located a settlement dated to the EBA and to the historical period. (Epyov YIIO71 3, 128) Work on the Derveni-Rentina-Strymon section of the Egnatia Odos revealed a 2nd Ct AD farm, to which a triclini- um room was added during the 4th Ct AD, in the valley E of Lagynai, in the chora of anc. Lete. Excavation of a farm build- ing block dated to the end of the 4th Ct BC, with a destruction level dated to the 3rd-2nd Ct BC, started in the Riviera-Asprovalta area. Arethousa (10 km N of Rendina). In July 1999 the Finnish Institute at Athens launched an archaeological field project in Arethousa, to include three field seasons between 1999 and 2001. The director of the project, Dr Arja Karivieri, reports: 'The archaeological site of Paliambela was found during the excavations of P. Adam-Veleni in 1994 and 1995 (ADelt 454-6), when the excavations revealed the ruins of an ECh basilica (AEMTH 9, 351-65; AR 1999-2000, 83) whose main nave was decorated with geometric mosaic panels made of rough pieces of marble, schist and spolia. The choir of the basilica and the synthronon were found to have an opus sectile floor. The narthex of the church was embellished with figura- tive mosaic floors depicting two peacocks on either side of a 20 metres 139. Arethousa: ECh basilica fountain, surrounded by fish, birds and other animals. The floor mosaics in the lateral rooms represent two deers flanking an amphora, and a geometric mosaic. The Finnish Institute is continuing the excavation and study of the basilica under the auspices of the 9th EBA in Thessalonike (AEMTH 13, 117-21). A geophysical survey that was undertaken in the area succeeded in verifying that there is a concentration of man-made structures and finds near the basilica. Based on these results, trial trenches were dug in 1999 to the W and S of the visible ruins of the church, to expose other wall constructions connected with the basilica. Two trenches were dug W of the church in order to locate the walls of the atrium or peristyle hall in front of the main entrance, W of the narthex. The other two trenches were dug S of the church. A part of the expected outer construction and a door open- ing were found 4m W of the narthex. A thin transverse wall consisted of a statue base of marble and a marble grave relief that had been placed upside down in the wall. The grave relief with six busts and a depiction of a funerary meal can probably be dated to ca AD 300. A thick layer of roof-tiles from the destruction layer of the church was found in the trenches W of the basilica, as well as LR coins. The excavation continued in 2000 (Fig. 139), when the trench W of the narthex was expanded and new trenches were opened to the N of the visible ruins to reveal the N aisle of the basilica. The thin transverse wall W of the narthex was found to have been built above the inner corer of a colonnade, above a column base. The colonnade seems to belong to the first phase of the building complex, and will be studied more thor- oughly in 2001. On the basis of the iconography of the mosaics and finds, coins and pottery it is possible to date the basilica to the 2nd half of the 5th or the first half of the 6th Ct, and to discern at least two building phases in the church. The excavation of 2000 revealed the thick destruction layer in the N aisle of the church, consisting of roof-tiles decorated with finger-grooves.

Lete: Macedonian tomb C objects, fragments of lamps and glass items, as well as animal bones were found during the second season. It seems that the church was abandoned in the late 6th or 7th Ct. Furthermore, the floor mosaics were cleaned and document- ed in 2000 (Fig. 140), and a pre-consolidation and preliminary conservation were made, before the mosaics were back-filled for the winter. An in situ conservation of the mosaics is planned for the third season in 2001 in co-operation with the 9th EBA.' Asprovalta. Research conducted by P. Adam-Veleni revealed that the more than eight cist tombs found at Skoupidia Asprovaltas formed part of a LByz cemetery. (ADelt 476) Derveni-Lete. K. Tzanavari reports that the cemetery burials at Lete were restored for the archaeological park set up at this site in 1997, which represented all types of funerary architec- ture. Restoration work was done on the Macedonian tomb of Makride Bey (or tomb of Langada), a two-chamber tomb with an Ionian facade, dated around 300 BC; the only burial in this tomb was in a coffin lying parallel to the back wall of the building. Macedonian tomb C, found in 1962 to the E of the Langada tomb, was also cleaned and drawn; this is a sin- gle-chamber tomb with a facade decorated with relief bands, triglyphs, metopes and pediment, some areas bearing traces of red colour (Fig. 141). The excavation of test trench F revealed a two-chamber limestone tomb (7.02 x 5.01m) with a parapet along the walls of the plain facade; a sloping dro- mos, 1 lm long, led to its interior (Fig. 142). The plain fagade suggests the classification of this tomb in the same group as the Macedonian tombs of Larissa, Lakkoma I, II and III, Toumba in Paionia, and Nea Kerdyllia B. It may be dated | I 1j around the time of Cassander, but continued in used until the mid-2nd Ct BC. A pillaged built chamber tomb built on the verge of the dromos leading to the interior of the Macedonian tomb also comes from the same period. It is covered with coloured plaster, and on a light blue back- ground in the upper zone are rendered objects related to female dress and embellishment. A limestone coffin, which presumably contained the silver hydria found a few metres NW of this funerary group, was also pillaged. The above- 1 mentioned monuments were covered by a mound, . j r" a large part of which was demolished in road E works. A systematic study has been made of the area in which the above cluster of monuments was found. (ADelt 469-70) 142. Lete: Drumos. A. Keramaris reports that building remains were found during the digging of foundations at the A. Kampyles plot. (ADelt 470) Epanome. A. Bilouka reports her excavation of four LA-C graves: two cist graves, a sarcophagus and a pit grave (NW-SE, the skull to the W); the second cist grave contained the most important finds. A LR cemetery at Limori included two large groups of burials, mostly tile graves oriented E-W. Grave goods includ- ed LR coins, jewellery (finger-rings, earrings, fibulae) and, the latest find in date, an Ephesian lamp (6th Ct) stamped with a cross on the outer base. (AEMTH 11, 481-91) Further excavations in 1998 on the same site, in field 1377A at the Byadoudi site, brought to light remains of a three-aisle ECh basilica. Combining Oriental and HL features, this evident- ly once ornate structure must have served the community attest- ed at Limori. The cruciform shaft for the engainion was also located, presumably on the site of the altar. (AEMTH 12, 241-8) Hagios Athanasios. M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti reports on 46 buri- als in the third mound with E-oriented MByz pit graves (10th- 1 1t14th Cts AD), mainly without grave goods. A built 4th3rd Ct BC grave in a rectangular pit was also found on the E slope of the mound. A Macedonian tomb (N-S), dated to the 4th Ct BC, was unearthed towards the centre of the mound (Fig. 143).

Excavation at the area to be occupied by the open-air theatre of the demos Kalamarias revealed an A and a C level, including a storage pithos and six cylindrical pits with A, mainly local orange-reddish thin-walled pottery. The archaeological finds in the N part of the site include EIA sherds. (ADelt 460-1) Karabournaki. The few building remains found in 1998 in the six trenches dug mainly in the W part of the top of the mound include a semi-subterranean bee-hive-shaped space, connected with a smaller one found in the previous year and comparable with those found in the periphery of the Gr World, e.g. in the Euxine. Movable finds include sherds of local and imported pottery in various shapes and provenances, not least many pointed amphoras from various workshops. Domestic areas yielded small artefacts (i.e. figurines, loom-weights, clay moulds for making jewellery, a bronze fibula, stone tools). (AEMTH 12, 223-30) Mesimeri. Excavations at the village of Mesimeri, 20km from Thessalonike, uncovered remains of the cemetery of a LByz settlement mentioned in the Athos documents and other, later archival material. The 23 burials were of the pit variety with few burial goods. One burial included a deep glazed plate cov- ering the face of the deceased. (AEMTH 12, 253-8) Modio. V. Misaelidou-Despotidou reports the finds from 17 mainly schist slab cist graves with many bronze R Imperial coins from Edessa, Thessalonike, Pella, Amphipolis and Kassandreia. (ADelt 474) Nea Mechaniona. A. Bilouka and E. Tsigarida report on LA-C burials (NW-SE) from the cemetery of ancient Aineia; the burials were found during the construction of sewage works. They included 14 sarcophagi, 11 cremations, 3 cist graves, 3 graves and a pot-burial in a bronze lebes. The grave goods included simple Attic and local pottery and (mainly bronze) jewellery. Macedonian bronze grave goods were often found in the sarcophagi. Particularly rich was the female child burial T18, as the dead wore silver ear-rings, a necklace with bronze beads, bronze amulets, silver and bronze bracelets, arrow-shaped buckles, etc. Finally, during the construction of a drainage pipe on the Nea Mechaniona-Angelochori coastal road, two cremations with HL sherds and 14 tile-covered and 2 pit graves were found (E-W, the skull to the W). The 2 tile- covered graves were excavated by the 10th EBA (Fig. 144). (ADelt 468) Nea Philadelpheia. V. Misaelidou-Despotidou reports on the finds from three tests on the occasion of the opening of a new Thessalonike-Alexandroupolis railway line. On the hill NW of the BA Toumba an IA settlement was traced. Building remains of two consecutive rectangular rooms of a building, 10.40 x 12.40m, with walls of rubble masonry, were confined to the NW section of the site. Two small walls NNW of those two rooms surround a wide storage-room with eight pithoi. IA-G pottery consists of fragments of painted imported G pottery, local painted pottery imitating imported types and plain pottery with incised decoration. R building remains were found S of the table of the his- torical period. Two buildings belonging to two different con- struction phases were unearthed (ADelt 471, fig. 7). The walls of the first phase are of unworked stone, and fragments of pebble floors are preserved. The few finds at foundation level allow an approximate dating to the 1st Ct BC. A second, three- 144. Nea Mechaniona: tile-covered grave</page><page sequence="90">90 DAVID BLACKMAN room, smaller building (10 x 18m) was built over the older building, with it N wall overlying the NW corer of the older building. The period of use of the buildings is shown by the coins of Nero, Trajan, Julia Domna, Constantine III, Valentinian and the rich pottery of the terra sigillata type, grey relief and simple pottery and late combed ware. The buildings were abandoned during the 2nd half of the 4th Ct AD, attested by a coin of Constantine III found in a sealed destruction level. Test C revealed an A and C cemetery S of the table, E and S of the R buildings. Part of a large cemetery with 92 late 6th-late 4th Ct BC burials, mainly sarcophagi and chamber tombs and pit graves; one tomb is apparently earlier than the mid-6th Ct BC. The orientation of tombs varies, but the posi- tion of the dead is fixed, depending on gender: male skulls are placed to the N or W, female skulls to the S or E. The 5th- and 4th-Ct BC graves contain two silver coins of Alexander I, many bronze coins of kings Aeropos, Amyntas III, Philip II, Alexander III and Cassander, Attic and Cor pottery, and many A and EC gold rhomboi and gold plaques. (ADelt 470-2) V. Misailidou-Despotidou has also reported on the finds from the fourth year of the excavations in 1998 that revealed the remains of buildings on a table-shaped elevation and an IA cemetery where ca 1,350 graves have been found so far. The most impressive building was a large four-roomed rectangular one, which had previously been two separate buildings. The most common burial practice at the cemetery is inhumation, though 54 cinerary urns have also been found. (AEMTH 12, 259-66) Excavations were conducted in 1999 at the area of the EIA settlement and cemetery. An EIA building with a courtyard was unearthed at the settlement. The cemetery produced a total of 1,850 graves. Certain graves of the historical period (dated to the 4th Ct BC and to the R period), along with the R building complex near the cemetery, indicate the continued occupation of the area through the historical period. (Epyov Ynn7 3, 130) Neo Rhysio. A. Bilouka reports two poros cist tombs with child burials (E-W), but without grave goods. Oraiokastro. M. Tsimbidou-Auloniti reports the excavation of a pipe (NE-SW) 7.30m long at the M. Innou plot; it crosses the site from N to S. (ADelt 468) K. Soueref and A. Matthaiou report that the remains of 4 graves, all of which are disturbed, were investigated in 1998 at Oraiokastro, allegedly the cemetery of the anc. settlement known as Dautbali Mound. Grave goods include a rfAttic bell krater with traces of white colour and a C leaden magic knot (late 5th/early 4th Ct). (AEMTH 12, 231-6) Pentalophos. A. Bilouka and K. Hatzinikolaou report finds from a brief rescue excavation at the A. Vrotsos field, ca 100m S of toumba A of Pentalophos: four tombs covered with poros or limestone slabs (E-W) contained four burials, one of them a child burial. The bones were disturbed and the grave goods (vases, terracotta female bust, iron strigil, gilded clay pebbles, etc.) date the burials to the C period. (ADelt 470) Peristera. A. Lioutas reports a mid-2nd Ct AD grave at Peristera, on a rocky slope. The only grave goods, four per- fume-pots, date the tomb to the 2nd Ct AD. Playari. K. Soueref and K. Havela report their 1998 investiga- tion into two pit graves with bronze and iron EIA burial offer- ings at Playari (PR settlement of Fener Toumba and Platia Toumba, table settlement of the historical period) SW of Thessalonike, between the airport and Angelochori. (AEMTH 12, 237-0) Polichne. A. Lioutas excavated a 400-375 BC cemetery at Navarinou 6. The early 4th Ct BC funerary gifts found in the 12 tombs excavated (11 pit graves) were in the main decorated vases of the same period. (ADelt 459-60) Pylaia. In the ESE section of the building plot of the American Farm School was unearthed a cluster of 12 ECh tile-covered graves (E-W), two with child burials; the only find in them was a bronze ring. The sculls and chests in certain burials were covered with roof-tile fragments. (ADelt 465) Therme. Excavation was continued at the ancient cemetery in the NE part of mod. Therme, and revealed ca 180 tombs alto- gether: pit and cist graves, sarcophagi and jar burials, 179 of which were investigated. The pit graves were in the main shal- low, and they were defined with cobblestones of various sizes, arranged in many rows. Grave goods date them between the LIA and the 4th Ct BC. Those dated to the 4th Ct BC are large, deep and rectangular. The dead were buried in smaller pits in their interior. Chamber tombs, burials in pithoi and cremations in jars were in use in the A period, between the 550s and the early 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 461-2) E. Skarlatidou reports on 52 out of the 55 burials found at Odos Makedonias and Mandritsa. The graves had been opened in a layer of pebbles and cobblestone, covering half of the site; most of the burials (43) were pit graves, a poros sar- cophagus, eight cremations in clay or bronze urns or in rather shallow, rectangular or ellipsoid pits. The earliest (LIA or EA) burials were plain, e.g. a woman with her jewellery. Certain of the clay and bronze urns, in addition to the pot burials, belong to the A period. (ADelt 464) Of the three graves (NE-SW) found at Pontou and Makrygianni, two were cist graves (one female burial with rich LIA finds and a child burial). (ADelt 464) Four burials were also unearthed at Ethnikes Antistaseos, during the digging of building foundations: a pillaged and almost destroyed poros LA / Austere style sarcophagus (1.95m long, E-W); a child burial (NE-SW) without finds, covered with a poros slab; and the burial of a man holding an iron strigil in a grave with clay-lined walls, along with a bronze double buckle, thin gold metal plates and a bronze coin of the period of Amyntas III (381-369 BC); lastly, a poros sarcophagus (NE-SW) contained finds that dated to 525-500 BC. (ADelt 464) Ancient Settlement. E. Skarlatidou excavated in a plot between Karaoli and Socratous, making a 27m E extension of the trench (1. 67.30m, w. 4.50-5.90/6m) which lies 50m NW of the historical period table of Therme. Its formation is asym- metrical and signs of water in it indicate that it was meant either to drain or to protect the neighbouring settlement. The pottery with LR grooved decoration found in the trench pro- vides a terminus ante quem for its use. (ADelt 465) On P. Tsaldari and Agiou Georgiou, E. Skarlatidou unearthed a comer of a cobble wall set in mud (w. 0.60-0.65m, h. 0.30-0.90m); its 5.60m long leg was partly demolished dur- ing the excavation; the other leg is 0.95 m long. The roof-tile fragments scattered in the area, along with the glazed pottery sherds, indicate that the building belonged to the Ott period. (ADelt 465) Part of an apparently post-Byz cobble and mud wall 8m long (E-W) was also unearthed at a depth of 1.50m at Ethnikes Antistaseos (h. 0.30m, w. 0.60m); glazed pottery was collected</page><page sequence="91">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 91 in the surrounding area. These two excavations will be contin- ued by the 9th EBA. (ADelt 465) Triadi. In the S part of a building in plot 88 were found frag- ments of a pithos. At a depth of 0.30m was found in situ half of an ovoid pithos (NE-SW) of 1. 2.20m and w. 1.15m; frag- ments of the upper half were found inside and in the surround- ing area. A few probably HL thin sherds of wheel-made pottery were found at the edges of the pithos. The owner of the build- ing reports that bronze scyphoid bracelets and other jewellery were found there in the past. The site lies E of Therme, of the Toumba, the Table and the cemetery, near the stream that sep- arates Therme from Triadi (N-S). (ADelt 465-6) Trilophos. Mesimeriane Toumba. D. Grammenos reports the results from stratigraphic tests on the W slope of the tumulus. Remains of a burnt house were found at a depth of 4.50m from the top of the tumulus; the house floor lay beneath scattered clay and wooden wall fragments; and an open rectangular clay hearth was found on the floor. Remains of an ellipsoid clay kiln were found at the NW comer, whose walls were preserved to a height of 0.20-0.30m. N and S of the kiln lay three storage vases of unbaked clay, which was baked during the fire. E of the kiln lay an EBA house, with three vases (one smaller) on its floor. Part of an IA wall of rubble masonry was found further W, at a depth of 6.50m from the top of the tumulus. Part of a large circular pit was found in the N section of the test and a large area of a stamped-earth floor lay at a depth of 7.40m; its N part was demolished when the pit was dug. The S section of the test revealed a row of post-holes (SE-NW). G finds in test IV, W and 3m beneath test III, belonged to part of a rectangular build- ing, with dry-stone walls. A large storage pit, 2m deep and with a diameter of 1.80m, was found at the centre of the site. When the pit ceased to be utilised, it was filled in and a large pointed pithos covered its mouth. (ADelt 467) Nome of Chalkidike Rescue excavations in 1999. Building remains of 5th-Ct Potidaia and of HL Kassandreia, as well as R graves, were uncovered in 1999 at Nea Potidaia. Building remains of the A and C polis were found at Nea Kallikrateia and tombs dated between the A and R period. Building remains of the anc. city were found at the mod. settlement of Athytos (anc. Aphytis). A single destruction and abandonment level was noticed in them in the mid-4th Ct BC. Eight A graves were also excavat- ed; among the grave goods is a Chian kylix of the mid-6th Ct BC. More than 500 graves were investigated at lerissos, at the cemetery of anc. Akanthos, which covers the life of Akanthos from the A through to the R period. (Epyov YIHO 3, 129) lerissos (anc. Akanthos). E. Trakosopoulou reports on exca- vation in the cemetery of 569 A through to R Imperial graves. Inhumations, more than half being child burials, outnumber cremations. Pottery finds include a LA amphora with linear decoration. Part of the anc. cemetery was preserved intact beneath a house built in 1935, which was demolished. (ADelt 481-2) Topographical survey and test trenches were made in the settlement area over the three hills and alongside the fortifica- tion walls. The initial settlement nucleus and a cluster of C and HL public buildings were tentatively located on the SE hill, at the Kastro. The foundation of a badly preserved rectangular temple was revealed aligned E-W, with few finds. The central city gate presumably lay on the W slope of the Kastro, at Ladiava, beneath the Byz church of Hagios Demetrios. A second building, part of which had been noticed in a test trench in 1983 and 1984 (aligned N-Sand with careful granite and poros masonry) was revealed nearby. At least three unex- plored rooms lie on its E side. The excavation's N sector is occupied by a courtyard, a rectangular open-air area paved with marble slabs, with two wells with marble parapets. Movable finds include household HL pottery (mainly sherds of Megarian bowls and 'West Slope' pottery), many sherds of white pottery, figurines and coins. Not much information survives regarding the nature and use of the (presumably public) building. An earlier, 8th-Ct BC settlement area was traced on the W side of the building, where part of a storage-room with pithoi, G and orientalising pottery were found. In the N part of the same sector part of a floor was found, along with a rectangular hearth. (ADelt 482-3). Kelli. A. Keramaris reports the excavation of a tile-covered grave with an interior arch (N-S), (outer L. 2.46m, outer w. 2.90-3.20m / inner l. 2.46m, w. 1.86-1.96m, h. 2m). The tomb, dated to the 250s, was built with rubble stones bonded with lime plaster and had an apsidal entrance, which was covered by a stone after the burial. The tomb contained 11 burials, with a lamp, large sherds, a small clay pot and a glass pot. (ADelt 480) Kriaritsi Sykias. S. Asouchidou, D. Mantazi and St. Tsolakis report on the EBA burial mound at Kriaritsi, found on a low hill 5km from the mod. settlement of Sykia. The pottery has a small variety of shapes; most pots have been smoothed on the outside, and grey and red colours prevail. They are all hand- made and are classified as cinerary urns, vases covering the urns and grave goods. The cemetery is unique in Macedonia both for its construction and for the burial practice, i.e. crema- tions. Our observation of dated examples of pottery allows us to date the burial mound to the EBA. (AEMTH 12, 269-82) The excavation inaugurated in 1998 at Kriaritsi was com- pleted. 13 ancient sites were located in the area where summer settlements are currently being built. Building remains of hous- es and a burial tomb of the EIA, alongside architectural remains of farms and workshops dated to the 4th Ct BC and to the HL period were found at the 5 sites excavated. Nea Rhoda (Xerxes' Canal). Dr Richard Jones (BSA) reports on the 2000 investigations: 'A short season was held at Xerxes' Canal in December 2000. Its first aim was to study further the cores taken at the S end of the canal in December 1999. Results of the sediment analysis in these cores together with earlier seismic survey strongly support the contention that the Canal did reach the sea at this point; in other words, we do not believe, as some anc. authors have suggested, that there was a short stretch of diolkos linking the sea to the canal proper. Yet there are some puzzles, for instance the finding of small pottery fragments and terres- trial shell at a depth of at least 5m in one of the cores at the S end. Work continues in Thessalonike on these cores, as well as on the analysis of pollen from the cores. The second and larger aim was a new seismic refraction survey by Dr V. Karastathis (National Observatory of Athens) with Richard Jones to examine the course of the canal at its N (i.e. Nea Rhoda) end. Probably for the first time in Greece, the seismic measurements were taken in 3-D mode by stacking the data from five parallel traverses. The results are most impor- tant, indicating that the canal's course is straighter than either previous results have hinted or the current lowest topography would suggest. It now seems likely that the canal met the sea at Nea Rhoda up to 100m farther E than had previously been thought.'</page><page sequence="92">92 DAVID BLACKMAN 145. Olynthos, house on North hill: courtyard Olympias. Scattered archaeological sites were located, the ear- liest of which is dated to the EIA and the latest ones to the Ott period. A building complex with workshops and storage-rooms was revealed. Two construction phases may be distinguished, confirming continued inhabitation of the site from the 4th to the 1St Ct BC. Three kilns dated to the end of the 3rd Ct BC are of particular interest. (Epyov YHHO 3, 129-30) Olynthos. Conservation and restoration of the monuments were continued at Olynthus in 1999, with work in the agora and in the SW part of the S wall. S. Protopsalti reports on finds from the W section of the settlement of the Northern Hill (13 houses altogether) and on its fortification (ADelt 480); also on excavation of the floors in areas e (pastas) and g (courtyard) of house AVIII8. A layer with pebbles and plaster, tiles, pottery fragments and an in situ stone base was found in the courtyard, alongside two pillar bases from the pastas. A rectangular stone (0.23 x 0.22m) by the SE stone base was presumably meant to support a door. The destruction level contained pointed amphoras, and ten loom- weights were found to the S. The S wall of the courtyard was also revealed (Fig. 145). (ADelt 478) Excavation in lane O.T.AIV included the N wall of the public building, the so-called 'arsenal', S of the building block. The clay drain-pipe has been destroyed at the level of house AIV9. A stone drain (W-E) was found alongside the E section of house AIV7; a floor beneath a dense and extended destruc- tion level with roof tiles was found in the lane of house AIV5; 34m of the N wall of the 'arsenal' were in bad condition and three large cornerstones were traced in the E section of the wall. (ADelt 479-80) Restoration of building block AVIII on the N Hill lasted 6 months in 1995. Study for the restoration of building block AIV was also made. (ADelt 495) Potidaia. D. Kousoulakou reports on the finds from the R. Gregoriou plot: part of a R building, oriented N-S, with rubble and tile-fragment walls, some of which are bonded by lime mortar. To the NW is preserved a wall corer filled with stones and material in secondary use, including fragments of an ECh Ionic capital and of a stone pillar. To the W also survive a slightly earlier kiln, many scattered rubbish pits and a HL well 3.50m deep with walls covered with white clay, and an A pear- shaped kiln with a central pillar supporting the firing-chamber. (ADelt 476-8) Skala Phourkas. A rescue excavation of nine tombs (E-W) conducted by H. Anagnostopoulou in the W section of the plot revealed 7 tile-covered graves, 1 pot burial and 1 cist grave without grave goods, except a small glass late 3rd-early 4th Ct AD amphora. (ADelt 478) Stageira. K. Sismanidis reports on the fortification walls, on the arrangement of the houses and on the public buildings of the city. A 50m stretch of the inner face of the C walls, with large and protruding schist slabs, was found E of the acropolis; this face follows the 'Egyptianizing' style, while the outer face was built in the Lesbian style. Part of the ECh fortification with an elaborate double wall was unearthed in the SE sector of the ancient city. A circular water cistern was unearthed on the N hill in the area of the A temple and the Thesmophorion. Next to the cistern the foundation walls of a large rectangular A building were found along with sections of C shops (Fig. 146), with fragments of three pithoi and a large clay basin, all con- nected with lead strips. A particularly elaborate stone-paved road goes past them. Finds include sherds of Attic and Cor pot- tery, 38 sculpture finds including A through to R figurines and protomai, three lead weights, a lead covering of a sword hilt and 200 coins (10 of them silver) of cities and of Macedonian kings. The restoration of the wall was also started this year, at parts of the fortification wall on either side of the entrance at the peak of the South Hill, at the circular tower to the right of the entrance and at the large rectangular tower further E. (ADelt 480-1) A study was made for the restoration and presentation of the site. (ADelt 496-7) 146. Stageira: shops with pithoi</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 93 Nome of Pieria Railway construction led to continued rescue excavation in Pieria in 1999, e.g. in the area of Platamon, in S. Pieria, at three sites located during the opening of a new tunnel. Beneath the ellipsoid G building at Krania (anc. Herakleion), a LBA peribolos and terrace, and an earlier LN settlement were locat- ed. Few remains of 5th and 4th-Ct BC workshops were located above the G building. Above those, a 3rd-Ct BC terrace led to the acropolis of anc. Herakleion. The destruction level of the city was dated to the 2nd Ct BC. A 4th-Ct BC farm producing wine was located at the site Komboloi and the destruction level of this site is dated to the late 4thearly 3rd Ct BC. A large 4th-Ct farm, destroyed in the early 3rd Ct, was unearthed at the site Tria Platania. It was soon rebuilt and its final destruction is dated to the 2nd Ct BC. (Epyov YHHO7 3, 130) Short reports are provided on the ongoing excavations at Louloudies Kitrous and in the Platamon castle complex (ADelt 541, see AR 1999-2000, 88-89). Aiginio, Melissia. Research started in 1994 was continued at the cemetery at Melissia Aiginiou; 94 tombs were excavated, some dating to the EIA, but most dating between 350 and 250 BC. The cemetery extends on either side of the anc. road. The skull was placed to the W in male burials and to the E in female burials. That 17 of the 34 female burials contained jewellery tempts M. Besios to relate this to the assignation by Philip of the Methonian chora to Macedonians. (ADelt 485) Dion. Floods in 1999 triggered cleaning and conservation works in the area of the N wall and at the Isis temple, and they underlined the need for extensive cleaning and conservation work for the protection of the site from flooding. Kitros. Louloudia. Near the ECh cemetery and the fragmen- tary early IA remains excavated in 1992 and 1993, part of the ancient settlement was unearthed at the N end of the Katerine plain, 3km from the Thermaic Gulf and 6km S of Pydna, on the ancient road that led to Dion. This confirmed the settlement's continued inhabitation from the LBA through to the ECh peri- od; 200 tombs of the respective periods were also excavated. During the EIA the LBA settlement becomes denser and it expands to the S slope of the hill. The A and C settlements are even more densely populated and they are located on the slope of the hill during the HL and the R period. The limits of the LBA and the EIA settlement were not fixed; but they were sta- bilized on the N after the 6th Ct BC. The settlement had many 6th-Ct and early 5th-Ct (child) burials, but the main 5th and 4th-Ct BC cemetery, developing into a dense late 3rd-early 4th Ct AD cemetery, was found beyond the N end of the city. On the top of the hill only the basement rooms of the hous- es were preserved. Large circular pits for storage and smaller pits for placing large pointed amphoras were found. Two wells and trenches for land cultivation were also found, alongside two trenches identified with ruts in anc. roads. On the S slope of the hill fragments of C and HL walls are also well preserved. Unbaked bricks were utilised for the construction of houses, because of the absence of quarries in N Pieria. The walls of some LR Houses are also well preserved. Finds include nails, iron lumps, everyday pottery and a terracotta figurine portray- ing Dionysos in a wreath. (ADelt 486-7) Leibethra. The project entitled 'Leibethra, Reconstruction- Promotion of the Site' aims to protect the site from torrents and to organize it into an archaeological-natural park. Two of the test trenches in the N sector of the acropolis had previously revealed the corers of two buildings, most of which had col- lapsed, along with the peribolos of the walls on the bank of the river Griva. One of these buildings was used for storage and lasted throughout the HL period. The large number of movable finds includes many LA-LHL bronze coins, not least a hoard of 16 silver HL tetradrachms found during surface cleaning. (ADelt 497-8) Louloudies. Further excavation of the Episcopal palace in 1997 is reported in AEMTH 11, 289-96 (see AR 1999-2000, 88). Significant traces of the 2nd-Ct AD R settlement were found under the ECh remains. Remains of a villa rustica of the Tetrarchic period were located, with fine mosaic floors (geo- metric patterns). Materials from the villa were used for the construction of the Episcopal palace, ca 479, when the bish- opric of Pydna was relocated here. Originally a semi-fortified structure (four-towered enclosure measuring 80 x 90m), the complex was expanded in Justinianic times into a small com- munity with workshops and related structures. The complex was abandoned by the 7th Ct due to Slav incursions. Makrygialos. M. Pappa and M. Besios report on a sector of the first EN phase of the flat extended N settlement. Continued investigation of the perimeter trenches confirmed that their outer side was protected with dry stone walls. Large pits and smaller rooms for everyday use, rooms for food preparation and rubbish pits were also investigated. Mobile finds include black polished vases, small clay and oyster-shell objects, fig- urines, bone and stone tools. (ADelt 483-84) Neos Pandeleimon. Rescue excavations uncovered part of an ECh cemetery (21 burials) and three R lime kilns at 'Nekrotapheio Hill' (AEMTH 11, 267-74) Paliambela. Drs P. Halstead and K. Kotsakis led an Anglo- Greek team, from Sheffield, Thessalonike, Cambridge and London Universities, in a first season of excavation. They report: 'The long-term aims of this project are to explore the apparent transformation of an extended settlement (a type best known from nearby LN Makrygialos) into the more familiar compact 'tell' or mound settlement, and also the relationship between this transformation and the emergence of the 'house- hold'. Work prior to excavation included intensive surface col- lection, geophysical survey and selective coring of the settle- ment mound on the E edge of the modem village. Surface col- lection revealed widespread EN, MN and LN scatters, with small quantities of later pottery. Coring indicated archaeologi- cal deposits to a depth of 2.5m, while geophysical survey sug- gested a series of concentric walls and ditches around the mound. (Fig. 147) Seven excavation trenches were opened, with two principal objectives (Fig. 148): on the NW and N of the mound, to test the preservation of occupation deposits; along the S and SE of the mound, to explore the circuit ditches/walls indicated by geophysical survey. The NW trenches revealed fragments of early LN (pre-Dimini) cobbled surfaces and exterior 'yard' accumulations, heavily disrupted by Byz graves and recent burrows, but in situ clay facilities of late LN date were found almost immediately below the surface in the N trench. Several surfaces produced sherds of restorable vessels, suggesting that excavation on a larger scale should reveal intelligible activity areas. The S trenches uncovered a circuit wall, with both inte- rior and exterior cobbled surfaces forming two stepped ter- races, of probable MN date. In the SE trench was found a sim- ilar but more massive circuit wall with exterior cobbled surface overlying a circuit ditch, all probably of late LN ('Classical</page><page sequence="94">94 DAVID BLACKMAN Xnpax 1' AiroTeX)i'oarnCaXT( F;xt4uVK1S MXrr,Tl,s P.l} 0 20 40 60 80 eters ..... 147. Paliambela: geophysical survey Dimini') date and cut into MN and early LN 'yard' accumula- tions. A third objective of the first season was to develop pro- tocols for detailed context recording and for intensive wet- and dry-sieving, bio- and geo-archaeological sampling, and wet- sieve residue sorting. These were tested with success and trench supervisors received feedback on deposit date, integrity and function from preliminary scanning of pottery, bones and seeds. A few rich seed samples were retrieved and fragments of burnt roof, wall and bin (not in situ) promise further such finds at greater depth. Reported chance finds indicate Neolithic (including EN) occupation N of the village and clarify the transformation from extended settlement to compact 'tell'. Most trenches revealed 'yard' levels rather than domestic architecture, and occupation traces in each trench are of different dates, suggesting that the spatial organization of the Paliambela mound retained, within its circuit walls/ditches, many features of extended sites.' Platamona. AEMTH 11, 241-54 reports small-scale investiga- tions in the castle during 1995 and 1997. Cemeteries around two churches therein are discussed in AEMTH 11, 257-66. The latter excavations found burials with coins and objects dating from Justinianic to LByz times, including items of jewellery and a variety of Byz plain and glazed pottery. Excavations at nearby Proti and Deuteri Misagia in 1997 uncovered remains of three rubble walls dated by glazed pot- tery to the 13th Ct. On the N slope of the Kastro Hill, building remains of the 6th-7th Cts were found but little concrete evi- dence exists of the nature of inhabitation. At another point, coins and a pectoral cross of the 13th Ct were located. (AEMTH 11,275-87) Pydna. Investigation of 930 tombs in the north cemetery, not least those of 400-375 BC, indicates that Pydna was not whol- ly abandoned after the transfer of the population by the Macedonian King Archelaos to the interior; the tombs down- date the use of the cemetery to the early 3rd Ct BC instead. Most of the 5th and 4th-Ct tombs overlay tombs of the previous phases and many tombs have been plundered. A hoard of 40 coins (1 silver, 39 bronze) in a tile layer indicates that the site was inhabited. (ADelt 484) A rescue excavation unearthed 125 tombs dated to the early IA and the 4th/early 3rd Ct BC.

Paliambela: site to the 2nd Ct BC, and a few tombs without grave goods belong to the ECh period. Few tombs survive from the EIA. From the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC onwards the main chamber tends to become monumental in size, and its vertical sides are covered with plaster. There are also pits on the floor of the tomb. (ADelt 484) In the south cemetery, rescue excavations were continued in 1999 and tombs of the EIA, C and HL periods were found. (Epyov YH7HO 3, 129) Investigation into HL and R tombs in the west cemetery of Pydna yielded clay and some bronze vases, bronze coins, gold jewellery, etc. The tombs lie at the junction between two anc. roads of Pydna. (ADelt 484-5) Nome of Kilkis Europos. Th. Savvopoulou reports on 22 burials in six tombs made of rubble masonry with lime bonding mortar and coating, of which many fragments survive. The human bones were scat- tered in the graves and grave goods include vases of everyday use, lamps and a glass amphora. Tests on the acropolis revealed a 24m-long wall and exca- vation was conducted to a depth of 0.80m from the surface. Finds include nails, iron lumps, pottery for everyday use and a wreathed head of Dionysos (Fig. 149). Tests at the ramps on the E side of the acropolis revealed a cluster of 14 tombs in the northernmost test, and sandy ground and soft rock in the oth- ers. Most of the tombs had few or no finds, consisting of 149. Europos: acropolis finds I - - . , I % 1</page><page sequence="95">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 95 150. Europos grave goods: gold laurel-wreath human bones, 2nd-Ct AD clay pottery and figurines. Investigation was completed of a grave which was traced in 1992 and which was made of rubble masonry, with an inbuilt vertical clay pipe. A stone-built tomb with no finds was revealed upon removal of stones at the easternmost part of the building. Finally, an early 3rd-Ct BC cist grave was found with no apparent signs of disruption; it contained a male cremation, a gold laurel wreath and decorative flowers, two iron strigils, a spearhead and four lead handles (Figs. 150-1). The grave is dated by a silver Alexander drachma to 328-323 BC. A small one-chamber Macedonian tomb with an entrance at its S side, containing four burials and reused during the HL period, was found nearby. (ADelt 486-7) Palatiano. Heroon I. H. Anagnostopoulou-Hatzipolychroni reports on excavation of the buildings around the Hero6n as far as the entrance of the peribolos, on the peak of the hill (Fig. 152). Part of a N/S wall facing E, 0.90m long and 0.30m wide had been constructed with stones and bonding mortar. At the NE and SE parts of the peribolos, small floor fragments covered with plaster are preserved. Fragments of two clay pipes and a third pipe made of small stone slabs were found, all leading to the road in front of the Heroon precinct. Fragments of stone-built walls and clay bonding mortar were also unearthed. Large amounts of R pottery were found, and the lower / layers at the SE included a few 4th-Ct BC figurine fragments. /'5 Peribolos II. Research was continued and / / completed in the interior of the three rooms at the W side of Peribolos II, which were accessed only / \ from the E. The floors of the N and of the W rooms were paved with stone slabs. ( Fragments of 2nd-lst Ct BC Kybele figurines \ were found in the S room and two terracotta lion \ figurines were found in the middle room, confirm- ing her cult at Palatiano. Two built rectangular bases supporting the two pillars are preserved in &gt; . the middle of the middle room, and part of the foundation wall (N-S) divided the middle from the E level area. Two antae lined the door opening and access to the peribolos must have been stepped. Buildings III and IV were revealed to the S of -- X the corridor separating the peribolos of Hero6n I from building III. They comprised two and five rooms respectively. The walls of both buildings 152. Palati 151. Europos grave goods: strigils, handles are built upon the natural rock, with stone and clay bonding mortar, and have occasionally been repaired at a later stage. Movable finds (coins, fragments of figurines, kantharoi with 'West Slope' decoration) indicate an earlier phase of inhabita- tion of this area down to the 3rd Ct BC. The road surrounding the complex of houses III-IV and the hero6n has been unearthed. It is 62m long and 2.80m wide, and is supported by a terrace wall 3-3.50m high. At its N end it was joined by a road with stone paving rising from E to W. Part of a three-room building (V) on the N side of this road was investigated. A fragment of a 3rd-Ct AD inscribed funerary stele was dedicated by Magnus to the memory of his sister. Most of the finds are dated from the 1St Ct BC down to the 2nd Ct AD. Pot sherds mainly for everyday use, fragments of glass vessels, iron and bronze tools, lead loom-weights, figurine fragments, bone tools and bronze coins (of Alexander III, Cassander, Antigonos Gonatas, Demetrios II, Philip V, Perseus, Thessalonike, Amphipolis, Pella (187-168 BC) silver coins (of iano: site</page><page sequence="96">96 DAVID BLACKMAN Bottiaia [185-168], Macedonia [142-1], Philippi of the time of Augustus, Stobi (Imperial), Roman Pella and Thessalonike, Constantine II, Constans).

A burial including bronze ornaments of the 6th Ct BC was found W of the burial mounds; this led to the recovery of seven more burials containing iron swords, vases and bronze bracelets. (ADelt 488) WESTERN MACEDONIA Aiane. K. Papaiannakis and I. Gourtzioumi conducted the res- cue excavation of an early LBA cemetery of 28 graves in the Mantria locality. There were 16 pithos burials and 12 cist graves, most of which had been disturbed. The cist graves had pebble flooring and a stone-lined perimeter. Signs of pyres and bone piles were noted. The grave goods consisted of one or two handmade clay vessels, usually a kantharos or kyathos, none of which were preserved with whole handles. (ADelt 567) An investigation of the area of Ververi, which has been tar- geted repeatedly by treasure hunters, yielded the remains of 15 disturbed cist graves, oriented E-W and with a small amount of undecorated and glazed Byz sherds. (ADelt 567) Nine cist graves and four pit graves of the Byz period, with an E-W orientation (with one exception) and with no grave goods, were excavated in the Ayia Paraskevi locality, close to the 16th-Ct church where a road was to be opened up. (ADelt 568) G. Karamitrou-Mentesidi gives a brief review of the sys- tematic excavations carried out in the area of Aiane from 1983, which uncovered archaeological remains from PR to R times. She also discusses the historical identity and significance of the Macedonian city of Aiane. (AEMTH 10A, 23-40) Axos. Excavations at the 8th Canal of Axos village revealed part of an EN settlement. A 10 x 10m trench was placed in the centre of the settlement where three habitation phases were observed. In the two earlier phases, the dwellings were made with a timber-post frame and probably consisted of one inter- nal space, and in the second phase they had a stamped pale- white clay floor on a layer of small limestone slabs. The first phase appears to have been destroyed by fire, as is testified by the accumulation of a large amount of clay lumps. In the third habitation phase there was a peculiar square structure with a series of partitions in the timber-post framed construction, which was founded in a ditch. Only monochrome pottery was found in the earliest EN deposits, whereas in the later two phases the pottery had incised decoration and white decoration on a well-burnished red surface, with linear motifs of triangles and lines. Finds from the excavation included bone and stone tools, organic remains (floral and faunal), the head and elon- gated neck of a female (?) clay figurine in the third phase, clay sling-shots, spools and spindle-whorls and, most interestingly, a child burial in a jar. (AEMTH 10A, 162-4) Edessa. The Groumba plot at 20 Dardanelles St is located by the ECh-Byz cemetery of Edessa. Ten burials were excavated, as was another tile-grave a little further up to the W from this group, and also a pipe-system covered with schist slabs in the NE corer of the plot. The ten burials were rectangular rock- cut pits with a ridge along their openings where the covering slabs (usually two schist slabs) rested, and some of them had two small steps to facilitate access in and out of the tombs. They were all orientated E-W and placed sequentially, parallel to each other. Some of the graves had white plastered walls and the plastering in tomb 10 had decoration on it in the form of a black-crimson-black band running all around the inside wall and, most interestingly, two crosses drawn with a crimson colouring (h. 0.42m and 0.40m), of particular importance for their distinctive colouring and dimensions. A rescue excavation was carried out on the Simadi plot at 21 Korae St where five Byz pit and cist graves were brought to light. The covering slab of one of the graves was a badly carved panel in secondary use, made of schist and decorated with two crosses in relief placed within a rectangular border and with later engravings. The stratigraphy of the site revealed the existence of R, HL, EIA and PR levels. (ADelt 558-9) A. Chrysostomou discusses the fortification wall, the stratigraphy and the cemeteries of Edessa on the basis of the last ten years of rescue excavations. (AEMTH 10A, 173-87) Florina. Excavations continued on Agios Pandeleimonas hill, specifically on the Lazega, Vogdanide and Louka plots, with the aim of integrating areas I and II from earlier excavations to gain a clearer picture of the anc. town plan. Roads crossing at right angles separated the building blocks and there were cob- bled pavements and stone steps. Three or four houses were to be found on each block with hearths, storage and workshop areas, and floors covered by either stone slabs, pieces of tile or earth. Pithoi were found in the storage areas containing cereal seeds and iron-working was confirmed within the workshop areas. The abundant ceramic material comprised vessels for everyday use, unglazed and bg, and pottery with relief decora- tion bearing floral and mythological themes. A large number of metal tools, mainly made of iron, were also recovered. Coins of the issues of Macedonian kings, but also from the mints of Pella and Amphipolis, cover the whole of the HL period. (ADelt 578-9) Kaisareia. The site of a cemetery from Ch times with cist and pit graves was identified at Ayios Konstantinos during a sur- face survey of the lakeside of Kaisareia. The site has been par- tially destroyed by the Polyphyto Dam and the rescue excava- tion carried out was mainly to determine the chronology of the cemetery. Five burials were investigated only one of which was undisturbed. There were no significant finds apart from a bronze ring found on the skeleton from the undisturbed burial and an oinochoe from another grave which was used for the dating of the cemetery. (ADelt 574) At the foot of Palaiokastro hill, the bones belonging to a burial were discovered during a surface survey but no other burials were found in the area which is periodically covered and destroyed by the waters of the Polyphyto Dam. It is thought to be a pit grave with the deceased lying on his back with the arms on either side of the body. It is orientated E-W with the head facing the W; no funerary goods were found. Based on the orientation of the body and the head, the burial was tentatively dated to Ch times. (ADelt 574) Kastoria town. A hoard of 16 Venetian ducats and seven early Ott coins was found in a glazed vase on the site of the church of Agios Zacharias on the Magazia site. (ADelt 605). Nestorio. Fragments of a LR mosaic floor of geometric design were uncovered on the Kastro site, where no such floor has previously been found. The original building may have been ecclesiastical, and the settlement must have been associat- ed with the nearby natural fortification of the 'Kastro'. (ADelt 611-12)</page><page sequence="97">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 97 Megaplatanos-Monastiraki. The existence of a LR building in the Eleutheriades field discovered in 1975 led to its expro- priation by the Archaeological Service. A votive altar dedicat- ed to Dionysos and a perforated clay plaque with four supports were collected from the site at the time. During the clearing of the field in 1995 a raised section became evident to its E, com- prising fallen unworked stones and plaster fragments. Trial trenches were carried out in that area and to its W, revealing that the LR building in the Eleutheriades field was very large and needed long-term excavation to determine its function. The finds from the excavation included sherds from ceramic vessels and pithoi with seals on their mouths, and small bronze fragments. (ADelt 560-1) Apagorevmene Hill is known from earlier and recent finds as the site of an organized cemetery. In 1995 three graves were investigated, belonging to the cemetery of organized burials all placed on an E-W orientation, the graves being rectangular rock-cut pits with their walls and top lined with schist slabs. (ADelt 561-2) Anc. Pella: agora. Tests were carried out in 1999 on the floor spaces which revealed Sth-Ct and 1St half of 4th-Ct BC burials belonging to the cemetery of the earliest phase of the city. (Epyov YHnO 3, 133) A building complex in the canal area ('building of treas- ures') was excavated by M. Lilibaki-Akamati in 1992, 1995 and 1996. It was divided into two sectors, each of which had an open-air space, and processing remains from workshop areas were also found. Evidence linking this complex to neighbour- ing ones was provided by the discovery of clay figurines placed in a niche, a small silver coin hoard and gold jewellery. One gold ring bore the image of a seated Mother of the Gods, which is considered a rare image on a piece ofjewellery. It was tenta- tively suggested that the function of the building complex was to serve as an assembly area for various activities. Lilibaki- Akamati gives a summary of the significance of the finds from the canal area. It is pointed out that this area yielded the earliest finds related to the first phase of the city as the capital of the Macedonian kingdom and that the building complexes seem to have been of a sacred nature. (AEMTH 10A, 93-104) The 1999 rescue excavations of the eastern section of the cemetery uncovered groups of late 4th-Ct BC tile graves and a marble relief tombstone belonging to the first quarter of the 4th Ct BC with strong indications of Attic influence. (Epyov Ynno 3, 134) Recent investigations of building V of the palace have led to its being interpreted as the palace gymnasion. It had a large courtyard surrounded by a wooden peristyle with porticoes. Near the N portico two rectangular stone bases with sockets and grooves for molten lead were found and they most likely supported votive offerings, thus demonstrating the formal and public character of the building. The E portico had a stylobate with a rectangular cutting along its length for the gathering of rainwater from the roof. Behind the N portico there was a sec- ond one with a series of rooms at its far end with a destruction level full of Laconian tiles. The floors of the N wing rooms were on various levels due to the natural rock formation on which the building had been founded, and they were covered with pressed white clay. The coarse faces of the stone walls had remains of clay on them that indicated they had been plastered to represent architectural decoration. A few stone thresholds to fit double doors have been found. Finds included bronze coins, bronze and iron nails, clay loom-weights, an iron stirrup, iron objects, undecorated and bg HL pottery, undecorated and glazed Byz and post-Byz pottery, animal bones, etc. (ADelt 549-552) N of the gymnasion building, two rock-cut open water channels were excavated which served the purpose of transfer- ring rainwater towards the channel of the pool. The older of the two channels was found full of HL pottery, Laconian tiles and other objects (ADelt 552). The whole of the E portico of build- ing I was uncovered in 1999, which exposed the horseshoe- shaped exedra located in the courtyard area (Epyov YnH70 3, 133). A corridor running N-S, W of building II and V, was identified on a lower level than the floors of the surrounding rooms. The stone staircase leading to building VI and to the gymnasion had its landing and six steps preserved in situ and the others had been plundered in the post-Byz period (ADelt 552). Between the palaestra and the fortification walls, a sec- tion of the wall was excavated in 1996 which was possibly used as a shelter by the palace guards. Clay water-pipes run- ning E-W and N-S are thought to be connected to the bath complex of the palaestra and to building IV. (AEMTH 10A, 120) P. Chrysostomou gives a detailed account of the building complexes of the palace of Pella. He discusses buildings I-VII, the incomplete stoa-like structure, the corridor W of building II, buildings N of the palaestra and buildings E of buildings I and IV. The palace is aligned E-W with five self- contained complexes, which have stepped platforms and stair- cases, corridors, colonnades and gates as a means to communi- cate with each other. The central palace area consisted of four grand buildings with interior peristyle courtyards in the Ionic and Doric orders. There was a long and monumental Doric colonnade (154m) by the facade of the central section, which was interrupted by a protruding 16m-long portico and a double pedimental facade, with Doric columns on the lower level and shorter Ionic columns above them. The main building phase of the S section of the palace core was dated to the third quarter of the 4th Ct BC. Additional formal and service buildings were constructed after the reign of Philip II and the demolition of earlier structures as well as their modification was carried out. Material from the early HL stoa-like structure was used in the construction of the new buildings for the palace and the actual stoa was covered up. In 168 BC the palace was stripped of its treasures and it ceased to function as the seat of royal power, and finally at the beginning of the 1st Ct BC the city was destroyed. In the following centuries, the ruins were used as a quarry for building material and in Byz and post-Byz times a settlement was founded on the site which to a large extent destroyed the palatial buildings. (AEMTH 10A, 105-42) Investigations into the LR and Byz walls of Pella are reported in AEMTH 11, 223-5. Remains of towers with R, LR and Byz pottery strata and coins (including a Byz issue of Alexios I) were uncovered on the Aphentoulis plot, first dug in 1995 (AEMTH 9, 117 ff.). Part of a 5th-6th Ct funerary stele and a R fibula were also found. Remains of an ECh basilica that had come to light during illegal digging in 1987 were investigated (AEMTH 11, 225-9). This monumental building, partly preserved to a height of 1.30m from floor level, was constructed on top of an important secular or religious monument, some 130m N of the so-called 'baths of Alexander'. The structure (1. 42.5m, w. 20.20m) appears to have been a three-aisle basilica with a timber roof and semicircular apse (di. 9.50m). The colonnades were artic- ulated with monolithic marble and granite Ionic-style columns. A rough 'mosaic' floor of stone schist tesserae was found in the aisles, while marble and stone slabs lined the nave. An exo- narthex was once accessible from the S stoa, but the opening was closed to build a stairway to gallery level during a later phase. The ornate stone work and decoration indicate this to have been an Episcopal structure, dated on the basis of coins</page><page sequence="98">98 DAVID BLACKMAN and other finds to the first quarter of the 5th Ct, with alterations in the later 5th and 6th Cts, and final destruction by fire at the end of the 6th. Many spolia from earlier structures were includ- ed in the masonry. Pentaplatanos. In 1995 P. Chrysostomou continued excava- tions on the N side of the hill of the anc. settlement of Pentaplatanos Iannitson following the trial trenches carried out in 1984. The object was to investigate thoroughly the various habitation phases of the settlement. The excavation, which incorporated the earlier 1984 trenches, revealed that the main habitation area was confined to the highest point of the plateau. The pale soil covering the limestone rock with EBA coarse- ware, testifies to the very first habitation of this area during that period. A cutting in the rock may have been part of a building on a semi-basement level and probable rock-cut storage pits were also uncovered from this phase. A painted sherd from the surface level of one trench and a moderate amount of surface pottery show that the hill was also inhabited during the LBA. No evidence for IA habitation was found in this area, as opposed to some IA remains found on the NW side of the acropolis, possibly due to clearing carried out in C and HL times for the construction of buildings. The northern point of the plateau was inhabited systematically during the C and HL periods. The foundations of the houses were constructed from unworked limestone blocks and pebbles; a semi-basement structure with built masonry was probably used for storage purposes, as were the large pits uncovered in this area. A hearth was discovered cut into the rock, containing unglazed and bg C and HL pottery as well as some animal bones and lumps of baked clay. In the same area, 24 bronze coins were found- 1 Amyntas III, 2 Perdikkas III, 7 Philip II, 4 Alexander, 1 Philip V, 7 unidentified HL, 1 unidentified LR, 1 Turkish. Habitation of the plateau seems to have been abandoned after the late HL period. (ADelt 553-6) Petres. The excavation of the 'acropolis sector' at the summit of the mound in 1982, 1983 and 1996 has revealed that a large area of its E section was used for the storage of various prod- ucts in large and deep pits. This seems to have been one of the earliest uses of the area. The contents of the pits were poor and only a few undecorated sherds were recovered. The next build- ing phase consisted of well-made cornerstone limestone blocks used on buildings which were organized into insulae, possibly dating to the early 3rd Ct BC. The third building phase covered a large area, where the earlier roads were closed off and the insulae of the town plan were reorganized. This phase coin- cides with the floruit of the city in the 2nd Ct BC. It was later destroyed in the mid-1st Ct BC at the time of the Civil War, and a hoard of 125 denarii placed in a undecorated pot hidden in a house was found and dated to this period. The majority of the coins were well preserved and are mainly from the mints of Rome, the earliest being from 105 BC and the latest coins dated to 43-2 BC. The city seems to have been abandoned from the mid-1st Ct BC, with a small population returning to the acropolis area in the mid-1st Ct AD; but, for the most part, the population moved and settled on the plains. (AEMTH 10A, 1-22) Phrourio. The site identified in 1994 at Kambos locality, to the right of the Haliakmon river, was investigated in 1995 to ascer- tain whether it was an extensive LBA settlement. The trial trenches revealed that the site was small and its function uncer- tain but with evidence of some form of use during the R peri- od. Two mud-brick R structures were detected which were almost certainly built on top of earlier structures of a circular form, cut into the natural bedrock and both having a dromos cutting to their W (towards the river). The southern cut had a diameter of about 2.4m, a depth of 0.63m and a maximum pre- served dromos 2.3m in length and 0.6m wide. The northern cut was about 2.8m in diameter and the dromos was excavated up to 0.5m and it was 0.75m wide. They are both thought to be of LBA date. During its R use the southern cut was transformed into an almost square clay oven inside which four small walls had been built to support a rack. An elongated pit was found immediately S of the oven, running E-W and filled with small stones, river pebbles, parts of stone tools and a large amount of handmade, probably LBA sherds. A square room was built in the northern cut, made of rectangular bricks with a tiled roof. A small mud-brick structure and two small walls parallel to each other with strong signs of burning on their surface, were also found in the SW corer of the same building. The sherds from the excavation comprise undecorated handmade pottery made from a yellowish clay (a few sherds have hints of a reddish coat), kantharos-shaped pottery, amphoras and double-handled closed-mouthed vessels. From these preliminary investigations, it is tentatively suggested that the site was used as a cemetery during the LBA and as a ceram- ic and possibly metal workshop during R times. (ADelt 572-3) Polymylos. An extensive rescue excavation was carried out by M.Vatali in advance of the new Via Egnatia where an inter- change is to be constructed. The area under investigation was W of Polymylos and to the right of the existing Veroia-Kozani main road. According to the surface survey, the archaeological site is connected to the settlement on the hill above, with forti- fication remains evident on its highest plateau. The foundations of part of a fortification wall were uncov- ered in the eastern section of the excavation. The wall ran NE-SW and was traced for 36m, with a width of about 2.5m. The wall faces were constructed with large rectangular stone blocks and the interior fill was made up of rubble. The top courses of the wall had not been preserved due to its pillaging for use as building material for later building works founded on top of it. PR handmade pottery (mainly LBA-EIA) along with stone tools found in the lower levels inside the fortification wall, gives proof of the early habitation of the site. The pottery in the upper levels and above the wall was mainly of HL date. On the E side of the wall, from the 16m mark, and even far- ther to the E, a total of 22 walls were excavated which were of later date than the fortification. The fill between these walls was a dark grey soil, which indicates a possible destruction by fire and consequent abandonment of the site in the first phase of its habitation. The walls, which were not particularly well built, were made from irregularly shaped stones and mud mor- tar and sections of the wall faces had preserved their plastering. The walls belong to two building phases and define rectangu- lar rooms in which two hearths (one circular and the other square) and two clay ovens (one horseshoe-shaped and the other circular) were found. Marble-processing debris and sev- eral half-finished stone objects, the most significant being a tombstone relief crowned by a half-finished pediment, provide evidence for the existence of a sculpture workshop. A destruction level of broken Cor and Laconian roof tiles was identified in the room with the circular stone-lined hearth. Many half-broken and almost whole ceramic vessels were found below the tiles: a pithos-shaped pot, an unguentarium, a lekanis, a pithos, plates, an amphoriskos with a pointed base, and skyphoi with relief decoration. Other finds included loom- weights, iron tools (one with a bone handle), lumps of vitrified clay and iron slag. Various interesting artefacts were also col- lected from the whole of the excavation area, such as coins,</page><page sequence="99">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 99 pottery, moulds for vessels with relief decoration and moulds for figurines which are considered highly important due to their rare type. The settlement's water supply was drawn from two sources on Vermion; clay pipes were uncovered running N-S for some distance as well as a drainage conduit made of square stone slabs. The finds from the excavation indicate that this was the site of a well-organized and economically flourishing town with a high standard of living and a long life, from the 4th to 1St Cts BC. Earlier and later use of the site is confirmed by the few sherds of C date that have been unearthed and the burial of a young girl with three bronze ear-rings above the HL house remains, dating to the Byz period. (ADelt 568-9) Prespa. On the island of Little Prespa, excavations in 1996-98 brought to light the remains of a M and LByz cemetery just S of the basilica of Agios Achilleios; 160 burials at three levels were investigated. The 15 coins found date from Manuel I to a Venetian and two Ott coins of the early 15th Ct, which appears to mark the end of occupation. The burials were made mostly within a tripartite structure, while the town (location unidenti- fied) flourished briefly in the later 14th Ct. Coin finds include a dinar of the Serb ruler Vukashin, the only one ever found in this area. (AEMTH 12, 527-542) Servia. Excavations inside the well-known Byz 'basilica of the catechumens' indicates possible earlier LR/ ECh settlement, in the form of pottery and coins (Theodosios I, Justinian I) . A detailed report is awaited. (ADelt 609-11) Sisani. An important review is provided in AEMTH 12, 517-26 of the notes left by the late S. Kissas on his investi- gation of the important MByz church, some 1.5 km from the village and next to the Panagia monastery. This elaborate structure of the 10th or 11th Ct included fragments of high quality LByz wall-paintings. The church (1. 34.50m, w. 18.50m) has a spacious prothesis and diakonikon; the latter contains carefully constructed tombs. The nave was sur- mounted by a dome resting on piers, which extend to articu- late the wall of the eso-narthex; there is also an exo-narthex. The sanctuary area is elaborate, with a low synthronon and kyklion. The central apse is five-sided on the outside, the smaller ones three-sided; all are semi-circular on the inside. There was a gallery, and evidently the building was con- structed as a single vaulted structure, not in phases. This Episcopal structure (remains of dedicatory inscription and painting of the Virgin being reverenced by a bishop) is tenta- tively identified with one of the anonymous sees established by the Byz state in the 10th Ct as it strengthened its borders with Bulgaria. Sparto. Three round pits with dark surfaces were detected at Dasyllio by the surface survey carried out by the lakeside of Sparto. A rescue excavation was undertaken with the aim of investigating the chronology and use of the pits. Two of the rubbish pits contained animal bones, wheelmade and hand- made sherds and ash, dating to historical times. The third pit was part of the remains of a BA settlement destroyed by the lake water. It was filled with burnt building material and had some handmade sherds. (ADelt 574-5) Velvendo. The excavation of a PR settlement at Vasilara Rache was started in 1994 and continued in 1995. The main aim of the excavation in the first year was to investigate the extent to which the man-made remains of the toumba had been pre- served, given that it had been repeatedly and extensively dam- aged by antiquities thieves and by the levelling of the ground to accommodate the surrounding plots of land. Two small trenches were made on the site: trench K on the S slope and trench L on the SW level area of the mound. Based on the evidence from the trenches, it was revealed that the set- tlement was founded on a natural hillock and its S section, where it is believed that the later habitation levels belonging to the LBA were concentrated, has been completely destroyed due to the land levelling. The depth of the man-made fill of the toumba is estimated to be 4m at its highest point and 1.5-0.5m on its SW level section. The dating of the material showed that the site was inhabited from the LN to the FN and during the BA. The 1995 excavation continued work on trench K and also on two new trenches, M and M1, which were located near the top of the toumba. Postholes and a section of a clay-built, curved 'wall' dating to the FN were exposed in trench K. Just below the topsoil of trench M, part of an EBA structure was uncovered. Its clay floor had been preserved and there was a hearth and a small, dome-shaped oven in the house. The hearth and the oven were made of clay and they both had an added layer of large, broken sherds beneath their surface. These remains belonged to the final occupation of the structure and there was evidence for another five earlier floor phases as well as two earlier ovens and three hearths. Postholes and ditches were found belonging to the various building phases of the structure, which suggest that it was most likely a timber-post framed dwelling. The carbonized remains of a pile of seeds (acorns and chickpeas) were identified and related to the earlier habitation levels of the EBA. Pits, build- ing remains with ash and a mound of unworked stones of var- ious sizes (mostly large ones) with many mill-stones were excavated in trench M1 (4 x 4m, immediately S of trench M) Some of the most interesting finds from the two fieldwork seasons are: four broken N clay figurines (one of which is an 'acrolith' and another is anchor-shaped), a broken N seal, part of a piece of bone jewellery, a perforated seashell, a half-fin- ished stone pendant, stone and bone tools, spindle-whorls and loom-weights. (ADelt 571-2) Vergina. Fortifications: the S, E and W sides of the wall of the city of Vergina have been identified; the N has not yet been found. The badly-preserved wall had stone foundations sur- mounted by crude bricks, a width of ca 2.2-2.8m and a perime- ter estimated to be 2500m long. Five towers have been located along the wall, four of them rectangular (1. 5.8-6m) and situat- ed on the S and W sides (having two towers each), with one semi-circular tower (di. 6.3m) on the E side. Two gates have been investigated on the S side of the precinct; one gave access to and from the Pieria Mountains and the W one led to the acropolis. The walls of the acropolis, which had a perimeter of about 210m, were made of local stone with dressed exterior faces and with unworked stones and soil fill. There was a central gate connecting the city to the acropolis which was 3m wide and had a 7m passage; two rectangular towers were explored as well as two staircases. The dating of the fortification wall and the acropolis is set around the time of the reign of Cassander (late 4th-early 3rd Ct BC), with repairs carried out in the reign of Philip V (221-179 BC), and finally its destruction towards the middle of the 2nd Ct BC. After this destruction, the area of the acropolis was used as a site for small-scale manufacture, judging from the existence of various finds and processing remains from workshops (ceramic, metal and textile). Evidence for the water supply of the site was found in the form of a 14m stretch of clay pipes. The acropolis was abandoned during the 1st Ct BC.

Kottaride gives a report of the last ten years of mainly rescue excavations conducted at the necropolis of Aigae, where 170 burials have been uncovered, located to the SW of the cemetery of EIA tumuli. All the historical phases of the city, from A to R times, are accounted for in the necropolis. Various types of burials are represented, such as pit and cist graves, tile graves and an impressive royal tomb, the 'Eurydike tomb', which is thought to have been built after the Macedonian kingdom was overthrown by the Romans in 168 BC. There are also some very rich burials dating from the 6th and 5th Cts BC. (AEMTH 10A, 79-92) S. Drougou gives an overall description of the sanctuary of the Mother of the Gods where excavation began in 1990 (AR 1999-2000, 94). A large and complex HL building built on top of a C temple has been uncovered. It had sacred rooms where cult objects and terracotta figurines of the goddess were kept, and a number of large rooms possibly used for secret ini- tiation rites. The sanctuary had stone foundations and a super- structure of crude bricks and it was burnt in the mid-2nd Ct BC. (AEMTH 10A, 41-54) C. Saatsoglou-Paliadeli gives a review of the shrine of Eukleia, using evidence from the past eleven years of archae- ological work at the site (AR 1999-2000, 94). LC and HL pub- lic buildings have been uncovered, and also an impressive group of 4th-Ct BC marble sculptures. Two twin-chambered temples, an altar, a colonnade and a large peristyle to the W of these buildings, which were destroyed in the 2nd Ct BC, were also brought to light. From the discovery of two inscribed mar- ble bases, the buildings were identified as the Shrine of Eukleia. The restoration of the architectural remains of the shrine is the main aim of future work at this site. (AEMTH 10A, 55-68) Veroia. A section of a HL wall was uncovered on building plot O.T. 213 at Bizaniou and E. Zachou Sts. The wall was con- structed of rectangular poros blocks without mortar in an irreg- ular pseudo-isodomic construction and it was founded on bedrock. It seems to be a continuation of the wall previously excavated on the same O.T. 213 immediately below Bizaniou St (ADelt 562). A group of nine burials belonging to the ECh centuries were excavated on the outskirts of the town on plot O.T. 319 at Kydonochoriou and Aspasias Sts. They were trapezoidal rock- cut graves with an E-W orientation, covered by a poros slab but with no funerary goods; the interior and bottom of one of the graves was covered in plaster (ADelt 562-3). During works carried out for the replacement of drainage pipes in Veroia, a section of a R road was uncovered at 29 Platonos St; a column with no fluting and a Cor capital were found, and a small mar- ble stele was recovered at 1 A.Tsoupeli St, depicting Hermes Kerdo6s holding a kerykeion in his left hand and a pouch in his right. A fairly well-preserved, large female statue with its base was also uncovered during these works by Kendriki St and 10th Merarchia St; it is a R copy of the known C work by Agorakritos of the cult statue of Nemesis at Rhamnous. (ADelt 563-4) Remains of a possible workshop were uncovered on OT 159, between the church of Agios Georgios and the monastery of Agios Nikolaos. Much pottery of all types was discovered, particularly glazed ware of the Palaeologan period, associated with coins of Andronikos II (1282-1328). Evidence for a pot- tery kiln was also uncovered (wasters, tripods etc.). (ADelt 607-08) Traces of an ECh cemetery were discovered on Odos Malakouse 17 in the form of a cist burial (ext. 2.30 x 1.35 x 1.25 m) oriented W-E. Evidence for painted interior walls was found. Three skeletons were found with head rests. Finds included a glass armlet with embossed decoration, the bones of a small animal, ribbed pottery and cooking ware, etc., all of ECh date. (ADelt 608) Voskochori. During rescue excavations in advance of the new Via Egnatia conducted by M.Vatali, LR baths were discovered at Ambelia. There is also evidence that the site served as a bap- tistery in ECh times. A square furnace room was located at the N point of the baths complex; S of this room was an area with pipes for supplying water, and further S was a rectangular room with a hypocaust which had a room to its E with vertical pipes for transferring steam. At the S point of the bath com- plex, at least three rooms were found with pebble flooring. Finds from the site included R and Byz bronze coins, R and Byz pottery and some metal objects. Two building phases of the site can be clearly identified, the second of which is its use as a baptistery, as noted. To the W of the baths, three clay water pipes were unearthed; these carried water from wells (one of which was identified on the E slopes of Vermion and others higher up) to the agricultural land of the anc. settlements in the rural districts of Kapnochori and Voskochori and the demos of Polymylos. It is thought that the anc. remains uncovered are related to near- by domestic remains, which are also connected to the ECh basilica with two mosaic inscriptions found before the war in a nearby field and now covered. (ADelt 568) EASTERN MACEDONIA Ambeloi. In 1995 two artificial mounds at the site of Toumbes, SW of the village of Ambeloi in the Prefecture of Serres were investigated. The larger mound is 1.3m from the village and the smaller 500m. Both mounds had been illegally excavated in the past, particularly the larger. It was thus decided properly to investigate this mound (di. 48m, max. h. 8.50m) which is con- structed of imported sandy earth, red earth and white earth. Pottery fragments within this earth included the mouth of an rf pelike, the handle of a krater and a bg skyphos. A cist-tomb was located in the centre of the mound, 1.8m beneath the sur- face, in a pit dug into the natural earth. The tomb had been pil- laged in antiquity. Within the tomb were found some bronze sheeting from an unknown object, a few bones and several pottery frag- ments in the earth. The burial mound was bounded by a sur- rounding wall of limestone slabs, two sections of which were located in the N and SE. The earth at one point of the N sec- tor was burnt, and there were sacrificial remains of broken vases and pottery fragments, animal bones and stones. Three broken bg phialai were reassembled. A small fragment of an rf vase with an inscription (AAE) was also found. Only a few pottery fragments were found in the SE sector of the sur- rounding wall. The pottery evidence indicates that the tomb was built in the late 5th or early 4th Ct BC. The construction and later care of the tomb, which according to the pottery continued for several centuries, suggests that the person buried within it was of high social status. (ADelt 633-4 and pls 192-3) Amphipolis. The new museum of Amphipolis was opened in 1995 (AR 1999-2000, 95; 1997-1998, 89), with exhibits from the PR period until the beginning of the Ott period. The foyer houses an exhibition of photographs of the excavations and the upper floor will be used for educational programmes in con- junction with local schools. (ADelt 615)</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 101 The donation to the museum in 1998 of a stele bearing a representation of a funerary meal, led to a rescue excavation at its find-spot in a field near Lower Amphipolis, just S of the walls of the anc. city. Ten R tombs were found; ca 170m to the E, nine R tombs had been found in 1995 during the erection of electricity pylons. The burials are a mixture of primarily cist- tombs, some cremations, pit tombs and pottery-covered buri- als. The terminus post quem is provided by a stele dating to AD 165. Old stelae and architectural members were reused in the construction of the tombs. Two tombs in particular stand out for their interesting grave goods (AEMTH 12, 77-81). A LR or ECh aqueduct was also found in this area (Epyov YnnO 3, 138). Widening of the Thessalonike-Drama road also led to the discovery of several 4th-Ct and EHL burials (Epyov YHnO 3, 137). Work on the irrigation network at Nea Kerdyllia, which in 1993 and 1994 had resulted in the discovery of several tombs in the wider area of Amphipolis (AR 1999-2000, 95), in December 1995 brought to light a double-cist tomb on the N bank of Kastrolakka. Both tombs were covered by four lime- stone slabs and three of the slabs from the N tomb had been used previously. The tombs were also built with limestone slabs and both had internal dimensions of 2.04 x 1.02m. The N tomb is 1.25m deep and the S tomb 1.15m deep. There were circular depressions in the corers of both tombs, probably for the funeral bed and for the placing of grave goods. Both tombs had been pillaged, but some items remained in situ. In the N tomb these included a broken spindle-shaped brown-figure perfume holder and a bronze medical tool. In the S tomb was found a bronze, almost square-shaped, external section of a casket lock and five small bronze rings or buckles. On the floor of both tombs were several iron pins from the funerary bed, and a few pottery fragments; several pieces of bone were found in the earth. This double cist-tomb has been dated on the evidence of the perfume holder to the mid-3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 634 and pl. 194) Rescue excavations were carried out at the PR site of Kryoneri near Nea Kerdyllia in 1996 and 1997. The PR vil- lage was on the S slope of a hill at the foot of Mt Kerdyllio, today 5km from the sea. The settlement covered an area of at most 0.3ha and the maximum depth of the fill (mostly LN) is 3-3.5m. During the N phases, the boundary of the settlement seems to have been marked by heaps of stones. Activities with- in the settlement included food preparation, ochre-processing, stone-cutting and domestic storage. Refuse pits and a pottery kiln were found outside the settlement. The palaeozoological remains suggest that the inhabitants of this settlement engaged in hunting and fishing far more intensely than those of other nearby PR settlements. In excavation sectors I and II, 3424 fragments of mammal bone were found, as well as a large num- ber of fish and bird bones; 679 of the mammal bones have been identified and analysis of the fish and bird bones is still under way. Goat and sheep bones were the most common bone-type found, yet their total number (26.3% of the total) was still quite low in comparison with the bone finds at other PR settlements in the broader Strymon river area. Pig bones (15.43%) and cow bones (9.43%) were also common. The pottery found includes black burnished ware with grooved and black-topped decora- tion and painted pottery of the brown-on-cream type. The pre- dominant type of pottery has black-on-red painted decoration (60% of the decorated pottery), with some impressive attempts to represent animals and birds. (AEMTH 11, 509-38) Conservation work on the columns of the gymnasion, and the continuation of the study of the finds, was conducted under the supervision of K. D. Lazaride. (Ergon 2000, 107) Anastasia. The modem church of Agia Anastasia in this vil- lage (28km. NE of Serres) contains substantial traces of an older, possibly 11th Ct Byz church, which now takes up the sanctuary area. The remaining Byz structure (2.45 x 2.40m) was domed and contains part of an original opus sectile floor, extremely rare outside of Mt Athos. The church was built on top of a vaulted structure, possibly a tomb which was used as a hagiasma. The church is mentioned in a 14th-Ct document of the Prodromou monastery. Remains of the corer of a church (?) were also located some five km SW of the site. (ADelt 672-3) Angista Remains of a possible LR farm house (villa) were encountered on the Kiose plot. A large structure (1. ca 50m, w. 22m) consisting of two wings joined by an open atrium was identified, along with pottery of the period. The central hall (10.70 x 14.50m) terminated in a semicircular apse, and a seven-sided fortification tower protruded from the general out- line of the building. The structure is built of local stone in the opus mixtum technique, and includes traces of mosaic floor with geometric design. The walls were mostly preserved only at foundation level, and the structure was quarried in Byz times. (ADelt 679-81) Anc. Argilos. Earlier references to this joint Greek-Canadian A-HL excavation can be found in AR 1999-2000, 96. AEMTH lOb, 663-80 contains a summary of the findings and conclu- sions of the excavators for the first five years of the excavation. ADelt 629-631 includes additional information on the 1995 campaign. Silver 4th-Ct coins from the Argilos mint were found in the large building on the acropolis. The excavation of the paved road leading from the harbour and the lower town to the acropolis was continued in the S sector. The size and dimensions of the large square HL building on the acropolis were determined during the 1996 campaign. This building is 14 x 14m with a im thick external wall. A narrow opening was located in the S side. The whole of the S wall and the SW corner were cleaned. The 1997 campaign determined that this entrance was indeed the only one to the building. There was a square covered threshold in front of the entrance, with sides of 2.75m, and an opening in the E. The Im-wide entrance to the building was in the centre of the S wall. Cleaning and mapping of the room continued in this year. It now appears to be typical HL house centred around a internal courtyard and is considered to have belonged to one of the Macedonian hetairoi who settled in the wider Amphipolis area. Evidence was found of olive-oil production in the building. Remains of a manually powered mill were found in between the two corner rooms of the E side, although the press itself has not been located. There was a well which supplied water in the NE corer of the courtyard and a thick layer of ash and black earth to the E provided evidence for the heating of water, nec- essary for oil production. (AEMTH 11, 539-48) Dikili Tash. A study season was undertaken in 2000 by R. Treuil (French School). The team continued and nearly com- pleted work on computerising the graphic documentation with the transfer onto the Net and digitisation of all excavation records. To the 31 TL and C14 datings already available for the N levels they added two C14 datings made in Lyon on bone fragments. The results, later than expected, pose new problems of interpretation. Of the worked lithic material, 60 tools and two nuclei were drawn. Macroscopic and microscopic observation was made of all the material of recent excavations and those of J. Deshayes to produce reference data for primary materials.</page><page sequence="102">102 DAVID BLACKMAN 153, 154. Dikili Tash: experimental construction techniques: silo 155. Dikili Tash: experimental construction techniques: oven Bone tools were listed (187) and in part described and drawn. The main materials were identified (long bones of ruminants; deer horn) and the main tools recognized (awls, chisels, graters); experimental tools were made. Terracotta tools were also studied and most of them drawn. Description and recording of architectural fragments was continued and completed with drawings and moulds. Experiments, closely linked to excavation records, were made on construction techniques of the walls, the silos (Figs. 153-4), hearths and ovens (Fig. 155). Samples were removed for thin sections or analysis. Samples of ceramic material were chosen for different pro- grammes (petrographic thin sections, analysis with MEB and stereoscopic microscope). Identification is noted of oil and beeswax on sherds already exported. 314 figurines and minia- tures have now been drawn and photographed. Samples were removed for future residue analysis. The study of the malacological material revealed the predominance of Cerastoderma edule which is adapted to marine life or life in brackish water, and the fact that priority was given to food intake; it is only after consumption that the shells were used for jewellery or tool making. The marine environment, strictly speaking, was little represented. The first volume of the Franco-Greek study programme was to be published at the end of 2000. It was devoted to the geomorphology of the Drama plain. Drama. In 1995 work began on the exhibitions of the new Archaeological Museum. Anc. artefacts were transferred from the Museums of Kavala and Philippi. The storerooms were organized and recording of the archaeological material on a computer database begun. (ADelt 613) Anc. Gazoros. In December 1994 bad weather conditions interrupted the rescue excavation on K. Paschos' agricultur- al holding in the cemetery of anc. Gazoros, near the village of Agios Christophoros, Serres (AR 1999-2000, 97); work was resumed again in February 1995. Vasilis Poulios reports that two more tombs were found in the SW section of the landholding, where 17 of the 18 tombs found in the previous year had been located. Both were cist tombs and perhaps dated to the early 5th Ct BC; neither of the graves had been robbed. The grave goods in the first tomb included an Attic bf lekythos with a representation of a Satyr kidnapping a Maenad, an Attic bf lekythos with a representation of a symposium and two lekythoi from the workshop of the Haemon painter. The floor of the second tomb was laid with small pebbles. The grave goods included an Attic bf lekythos with a representation of a symposium, also from the workshop of the Haemon painter, and an Attic rf lekythos with a representation of a woman standing in front of a basket, an exaleiptron of local production, a pair of silver and bronze ear-rings, a silver ring with a small seal on the bezel, a 'treasury' of 19 bronze fibu- lae, the remains of a completely melted glass vessel and 17 necklace beads. (ADelt 631-3 and pls 192-4) In October and November 1997 the discovery of two tombs during agricultural work on land-holding 1174 near mod. Gazoros resulted in rescue excavations. Magdalini Valla reports that a total of ten tombs, three pit- and seven cist- tombs, were found in the large cemetery of anc. Gazoros. Six of the cist-tombs had been pillaged, some more than once. Two of the three pit-tombs contained children's burials. Continuous habitation from the LBA to R period is attested by surface finds from the settlement and its cemeteries. Part of a BA settlement was uncovered, including part of a pile-dwelling and hearth</page><page sequence="103">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 103 with small storage pits and refuse pits outside it. Surface inves- tigations show that the settlement occupied a flat area of some 6 hectares. (AEMTH 11, 557-66) Glykoneri. MByz remains (burials, marble and wall frag- ments) were located on top of remains of the 4th to 6th-Ct set- tlement, which originally would have been on the shore of Lake Vistonis (Bourou). (ADelt 676-8) Orphanis, anc. Phagres. In mid-December 1997 a small exca- vation was conducted in the olive grove of I. Mavrides, which is in the wider area of the cemetery of anc. Phagres. The arched roof of a small, square limestone single-chamber built tomb of 'Macedonian' type was found ca 65cm below the surface (ext. 3.65 x 3.65m, h. 3.90m). The tomb bore signs of having been pillaged in both anc. and mod. times. There was no indication that it had been covered by a mound, although it is likely that any mound would have been destroyed by agricultural work. There was a small, rectangular 'courtyard' in front of the entrance, as with other Macedonian tombs. Fragments of unpainted pottery were found in the courtyard and in the SW comer were the remains of a fire, with burnt clay and pottery sherds surrounded by slabs and tiles. This was most probably used as a votive area before the tomb was covered. Entry to the tomb was made via a 'dromos'-ramp, 2m wide, which was dug into the natural sand, excavation of which was not completed. The tomb itself was built of limestone with a length of 2.93m and a height from the floor to the peak of the arch of 1.25m. The entranceway had been sealed with a pile of tombstones from earlier burials in front of it. Within the burial chamber, to the right and left of the threshold, were two square sarcophagi (sides 1. 50cm). These would have contained the cremated remains of the dead, but had been pillaged. There were very few finds within the burial chamber, with a few pieces of the bones of the dead, unpaint- ed pottery fragments, fragments of an rf pot and bronze brooches. The only complete find was a handle-less bg phiale of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. The monumental tomb has a similar date and may have belonged to the family of the head of the Macedonian guard and representative of the royal fami- ly in anc. Phagres. (AEMTH 11, 567-72) Palaiochori-Branokastron. The remains of the patriarchal stavropegic monastery church of Agios Georgios were uncov- ered N of Palaiochori in the vicinity of the Byz settlement of Branokastron. The three-aisle basilica, which originally had a timber roof, is mentioned in a document of 1474, but investi- gation leads to an earlier date, possibly in the middle of the 11th Ct, on the basis of a dated sun-dial found in the ruins (1069, but possibly 1269). Evidence for inhabitation extends from the 13th to the 18th Cts. Some evidence for wall-paintings indicates a MByz date. Much use was made of LR and ECh spolia, includ- ing part of the balustrade of a ECh ambo. Work continues on the remaining monastery buildings. (ADelt 681-3) Pelagia (Kilise Ombasi). Remains of a 13th-Ct (?) Byz church and surface pottery and tiles attest a settlement. (ADelt 679) Petropigi. In 2000 the team led by Prof. Siri Sande (Norwegian Institute, University of Oslo) undertook a study season of the material from the 1993-1997 excavation of the 13th15th Ct Byz statio, later Ott caravansaray, on the Via Egnatia some 20km E of Kavala. Work on the final publication is advancing. In 1999 a conservation campaign was undertaken (noted in AR 1998-1999, but no report was submitted to AR 156. Philippi: site 1999-2000). The object was to carry out restoration work on the badly deteriorated N wall. To this end, the team called upon 0ystein Ekroll and Geir Magnussen from the Nidarosdomen Conservation Laboratory in Trondheim. The aims decided upon by the Greek authorities were conservative, to prevent further damage. A traditional recipe was used for the cement, and all stones and brick added to the structure had been recov- ered during excavation. The site, which was fenced in 1998, was cleaned and various dumps of earth removed. The finds were moved from the storage in Petropigi to the 12th EBA in Kavala. Philippi. S. Provost and M. Boyd carried out a season of geo- physical prospection in 2000 for the French School at Philippi in the immediate vicinity of the 'building with bath' in order to define the extent of the excavation necessary to define the E, W and S limits of the insula to which it belongs, and to trace the roads in this part of the town (Fig. 156). It was hoped to verify the existence of two urban grids, to define their articulation around the Diagonal Road and to estimate their respective mod- ules. In the course of the resistivity survey, they located two par- allel roads in the S of the area which formed the E and W lim- its of the insula (Fig. 157). Approximately 60m to the S of the previously excavated area they recorded a large rectangular complex which might indicate the S limit of the insula con- taining the 'building with bath'. To the N the Diagonal Road could not be discerned as it was concealed under the old excavation dump, but it was found in the data gathered in the NW corer as far as the rampart and also to the NE of the excavated area. The team was also able in the resitivity survey to correct and confirm the respective limits of the two urban grids. The N grid was visible in the NE part of the area covered by the sur- vey, with two roads identified (cf. Fig. 157), whilst the S grid, already recorded round the 'building with bath', seems to extend to the N of the Diagonal Road along the rampart.

Hedges N of the excavat- ed area prevented the extension of the survey to the area where the two grids meet. A magnetometer survey was carried out on a much more modest scale. It did, however, supply some complementary data near the 'building with bath'. Two furnaces, possibly met- allurgical to judge from the surface debris, were clearly record- ed in the field to the E of the building and must be connected with the lime kiln which occupies the centre of the courtyard of the building. Agricultural plot 726 on the Toumba site provided surface LR pottery and tiles. This evidence, in conjunction with near- by mines and a spring, may indicate that the site was a vicus of the R settlement of Philippi. (ADelt 673) In 1995 restoration work was carried out on the anc. the- atre of Philippi with funds from the European Commission and the 2nd Community Support Framework. The funds from the Commission were used to record all the architectural mem- bers and fragments scattered in the orchestra, parodoi and area around the theatre. The CSF money was used to continue clear- ing up the area of the anc. theatre, removing rubble created by previous excavations and the use of the theatre for public events since 1958. In this year, work was conducted on the SW side of the stage building with the aim of uncovering the S facade of the building and excavating the seven areas that had already been partially excavated to the S of the theatre. Work was also carried out to uncover the road network between the theatre and the anc. city of Philippi. The excavation was extended to the W, where two other areas were uncovered, permitting the excavators to trace all the various building phases of the stage building. A second phase of use was identified in areas 1 and 2 around the stage. Evidence from the floors of these areas indicates that they were used as a workshop in the ECh period. A 3rd building phase belonging to the EByz period was also ascertained. (ADelt 634-6) Promachonas-Topolni&amp;a. The developments at this joint Greek-Bulgarian PR site excavation in 1995 are discussed in AR 1999-2000, 98-9 and ADelt 627-9. AEMTH 10, 745-67 contains a summary of work carried out between 1980 and 1996 on both the Greek and Bulgarian sides. Cleaning, analy- sis and recording of the archaeological material by the Greek team was begun in 1995. (ADelt 629) Work continued in 1997, the main aim for this season being the exploration of the arrangement of the buildings and their construction during the two earliest phases (III and II). The floor of a house in a trench 60cm deep was investigated and the removal of the fill revealed two construction phases. A pile of blades, stone chips and quartz chips were found in the phase III level, along with sherds from fallen pottery. It is not yet known if this was a stone- or quartz-processing workshop. Pottery, tools and figurines on the floor of a phase II house were covered with a layer of ash, representing a destruction level. Several post-holes were found distributed over the floors belonging to this phase. Many blades, especially of flint, and fragments as well as examples of complete pots were found. The pots were most commonly monochrome or decorated phialai and the tools mainly of stone (choppers, drills, blades) or bone (arrow heads). (AEMTH 11, 549-56) In 1998 the investigations of phases II and III continued and it was ascertained that the phase III dwellings were subter- ranean structures with the unexcavated ground being used as dividing walls. This is a common N house design in the wider region. The phase II buildings were pile-dwellings with large, undressed stones at the base of the walls and floors of compact earth with ovens within the dwellings. An interesting group of structures that may be associated with bronze-processing was found. These are three small depressions lined with successive layers of clay, ash and pottery fragments, and a deep pit in which was found a clay crucible. In terms of pottery and other finds, it is difficult to distinguish clearly between the two phas- es as there was much cultural continuity. An interesting phase III find has been tentatively identified as a large stone phallus 37.5cm tall, found beside a fireplace. (AEMTH 12, 67-76) Strymon Delta. A joint report in AEMTH lOb, 639-62 dis- cusses the results of research into the chronological sequence of human settlement in the Strymon Delta by a team consisting of archaeologists from the 18th EPCA, members of the BSA and the Hellenic Centre for Maritime Research. This research centred on an anc. settlement on Prophitis Ilias hill discovered in 1980 and identified by the 18th Ephorate as anc. Eion. Questions raised by the discovery of this site led to both archaeological and geomorphologic investigations of the Strymon Delta and the impact on it caused by settlement devel- opments at Eion, Amphipolis and Chrysoupolis during the anc. and Byz periods. Sixteen surface and in-depth drillings were made in order to study the palaeogeography and palaeobotany of the Delta. The archaeological, geomorphological and other evidence (aerial photographs, old maps, travellers' accounts) build up a picture of the Strymon Delta as an important eco- nomic, political and administrative centre, with discontinuous settlement from the LBA to the LByz period. Thasos. Excavation of the cavea, stage building and area around the stage of the theatre was carried out in the previous three seasons (AR 1999-2000, 100-01). In 1995 excavation of</page><page sequence="105">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 105 the parodoi, the lowest levels of the stage building and the orchestra was completed. A drain was found beneath the threshold of the NE parodos; it discharged water onto the slope of the hill behind the stage and does not appear to have been in use in R times. It can therefore be considered as marking the boundary of the HL theatre. A large trench that was opened up in the centre of the orchestra suggested that, pace G. Daux, there was never a pas- sage through which the animals used in the wild beast fights would have passed. The remains of several walls were found in front of the NE area of the proskenion and next to the threshold of the parodos. Some of the walls were built directly on to the natural rock beneath the surface. These walls most likely represent several building phases. In the stage building (Fig. 158), various phases of the proskenion were observed. A small foundation structure with- in the orchestra and in front of the SW comer of the proskenion was found, although no similar structure was found at the NE comer of the proskenion. Beneath the proskenion was a care- fully built wall with marble blocks and a pseudo-isodomic outer face, less than 2m down within the HL earth fill. This wall is preserved at full height and was clearly intended to sup- port a level platform. It is the oldest construction found in this part of the theatre and must have been part of a monumental building used for theatrical performances. The HL wall, which was later incorporated into the R wall, was located during cleaning of the long wall behind the stage. The three rooms of the stage building were excavated, although it was not possible to reach the foundation trenches, as had been hoped. Excavations within the rooms brought to light the foundations of many otherwise unknown structures belonging to different construction phases of the stage building. The oldest architectural remains in this area are of a strong analemma wall discovered within the three rooms of the stage building; it is certain that this structure was built before the stage was filled in with earth. (ADelt 613-17) New data from the excavation of R Thasos (AEMTH 11, 597-608) include evidence for a sophisticated oil or wine press, dated by 118 coins to the 2nd Ct BC-2nd Ct AD (Gkeka plot, outside the walls). Ruins of LR buildings (Zagorianos plot) were dated by coins to the 3rd-4th Cts AD. Finds includ- ed an inscribed statue base dedicated to Julius Aurelius Valerius Heracleon, who may have restored or repaired this evidently secular building. On Megalou Alexandrou St, part of the R settlement was found at the regular distance of 3-5m from the city wall. Found at this site was the upper part of a honorific inscription made by Smyrna to the dikastai of Thasos (to be published by P. Hamon). The other part of the inscription is in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum (IG XII, fasc. 8, no. 269). In 1998 twenty-five 4th-Ct BC tombs were uncovered in the necropolis of the anc. city, primarily cist-tombs (Epyov YnHO 2, 123). Excavations at the Yiannopoulos plot in 1999 uncovered a section of a building complex near R and ECh buildings. It is thus likely that this part of the anc. city, near the temple of Herakles, was used for public building in the R and ECh periods too. (Epyov YnnO 3, 137) SE approaches to the theatre. In a study season in 2000, the team led by D. Viviers (French School) re-examined the ceramic material in order to define the chronology of several stratigraphic contexts and completed the study of the bones of the skeletons found during the excavation of the proto-Byz necropolis. Rampart. A small team led by Y. Grandjean and Fr. Salviat (French School) studied the remains of the gate-tower of Zeus 158. Thasos: theatre with a view to publishing a complete restoration. Work has been completed on the (restoration of) the exterior Doric entab- lature and the general elevation. There remain a few problems which require a more detailed study of the building. The num- ber of architectural blocks preserved suggests that a complete restoration could be achieved by 2001. Storage and classification of finds. Fr. Blonde, A. Muller and D. Mulliez (French School) undertook in 2000 the transfer of finds from the old museum storerooms (1979-1985 excava- tions) and from the 'Portokaloglou' dig house (1992-1994 and 1999 excavations) to the new museum storerooms. The latter are now equipped with purpose-built sherd containers with drawers. They reorganized all the finds by type, find-spot and year of excavation, and arranged systematic storage of large stone or marble objects, amphora stamps, fauna and repaired vases awaiting shelving. The team arranged for the future transfer of material from the Valma excavations of 1965 and Evraiocastro (1962-1964) and have themselves transferred the small finds from these into the new containers. All original documents are being systematically photo- copied. These take the form of photographs, stratigraphic sec- tions, plans (including digitized plans), drawings, excavation note-books, and cards with detailed description of finds. After copying they are being entered into a "File Maker Pro 4" pro- gramme in order to facilitate the location of each object in its stratigraphy and in the museum space, and the reassemblage of objects of each category or stratigraphic unit. Copies of all documents will be stored at Lille and at Lyon as well as at Thasos and in the French School archive so that this transfer of data onto computer can proceed rapidly. Fr. Blonde also stud- ied the ceramic finds from the ECh house and nearby square and 400 drawings were made. Preparations for the publication of the proceedings of the study day 'Thasos, from Archilochus</page><page sequence="106">106 DAVID BLACKMAN 159. Thasos, Glykadi: farmstead to the Persian Wars' held at Lille on 25th March 2000 were also carried out and the manuscript will be sent to the editor of Topoi in December. At the request of the Kavala Ephorate Fr. Blonde studied ceramic finds from several pyrai in the 4th-Ct BC cemeteries at Limenas. This study will form an article in a book on the cemeteries of Thasos compiled by the Ephorate. M.-F. Billot and other members of the French School supervised the removal of architectural terracottas to the new museum stores in 2000. The objects chosen to be exhibit- ed by the museum curator M. Sgourou were studied, restored, drawn and photographed. Crates of material were regrouped according to site and type and much material was transferred into the drawers of the new storeroom, though some of the material in the storeroom is still inaccessible, and new shelving is required for the larger items such as tiles and cover-tiles. Drawings made since 1996 have been re-recorded on com- puter (MAC) using Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator 8 soft- ware. Y. Garlan completed his study of 3000 amphora stamps found at Molos and prepared for its publication in the Deltion Meletai. He also visited and carried out surface sherding on sites previously identified as amphora workshops and found unpublished types at Koukos, Keramidi, Konnophia and Molos and a triangular amphora lip (Pridik type) of before the end of the 4th Ct in a recently found workshop at Hagios Tryphonas. Figurines of Thasos. Arthur Muller (French School) supervised the transfer of figurines of the Artemision and Thesmophorion and other find spots to the purpose-built con- tainers in the new museum. During the transfer many frag- ments were found in old excavation crates; these were listed and stored. S. Huysecom studied the A figurines from the Artemision. This study with that of the Kouroi and Korai and throned women of the same period will form volume 2 of the publica- tion of finds from the Artemision. The study of A protomai from the Artemision was greatly helped by the new classifica- tion and listing of comparative material from the Thesmophorion. The work of classification and listing of the prototypes of the most common forms of protomai was resumed in a sys- tematic way, as was the general inventory of fragments from the Artemision and elsewhere. Work has been done on the photographic record of the fig- urines, checking the data already entered on the computer inventory and entering the EFA phototheke records. The first inventory II in the museum was a great help in correcting these data. The computerized inventory held since 1986 on a Microsoft File 2 system is now being transferred to a File- Maker Pro 4 system compatible with both PC and Mac. The file incorporates many features which will prove user-friendly to scholars. Thasos island Another possible Thasian LR olive-processing workshop was excavated in 1998 in the bay of Agios Ioannis in SE Thasos, 3km N of Alyki, which also contained remains of an oil press and mill. Three rooms and a storage structure were excavated. Less than 100m N were found the habitation remains of an anc. settlement with structures of mainly perishable materials as well as many structures relating to the activity of heating, per- haps for cooking or weaving, in an area of 20m2. Pestles, mor- tars, cooking utensils and spindle-whorls were found around the area. The limited pottery remains lead to the conclusion that the settlement was small in population with a short dura- tion. (AEMTH 12, 55-66) Excavation began on a farmstead at Glykadi, 7-8km from Thasos, less than 500m from the sea to the left of the Thasos- Prinos road. This is a large building, over 650m2, and perhaps the largest farmstead to have been excavated in mainland Greece. It is a single-storey building on a naturally level area (Fig. 159). Only two rooms in the NE corner were excavated. The main entrance has been located in the E side. The single-stone threshold of the door was found and next to it a section of the marble surround. Living quarters were identified on the N side. Two areas in the S which are approached directly from the outer area of the farmstead through a small door in the E have been identified as stables. A semi-circular structure in the external SW corner is reminiscent of that at the farmstead at Marmaromantra (ADelt 47, 465-7) and the excavators believe that it was used for grain storage. The small finds are quite illuminating, although not partic- ularly rich. These include vessels for daily use, mainly amphoras. The stamps on the handles date to the 4th Ct BC, as do the roof tiles and the few coins found (mainly bronze Thasian coins). The farmstead was built ca 350 BC and destroyed a couple of generations later. (ADelt 617-18) Limenaria. Two rescue excavations in the summer of 1995 brought to light archaeological material that shows that the area was inhabited from the LC to EHL periods (see also AR 1996-97, 85-86). The remains are, however, too fragmen- tary to permit conclusions as to the nature of the buildings. ADelt 619 includes a discussion of the finds made since exca- vations began at Limenaria. A more detailed report of the work carried out at the PR settlement of Limenaria in 1995 and 1996 appears in AEMTH 11, 585-94. EBA architectural remains over an area of 70m2 at the top of the hill of Limenaria were investigated and two habitation phases uncovered. The earlier phase includes a floor of pebble, sherds and compacted earth with a refuse pit, hearth and a clay bench. The N fill from this courtyard included pottery with a graphite, pink or buff pigment on a dark ground. There was a boundary wall to the N and this area was probably an open courtyard. The later phase featured a wide, slightly curving wall, ca 15m of which was uncovered, and an extensive area of stone paving. To the W were found 15 large oblong stones that were positioned vertically on the paved area and projected 0.30-0.40m from the surface of the paving. An oval stone with 30 depressions surrounding a single depression was found at the W end of the pavement. This phase is difficult to interpret as the finds have no parallel in Greece, the only parallels being with the megalithic monuments of W Europe. The moveable</page><page sequence="107">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 107 finds include arrow-heads and spindle-whorls. A large volume of unprocessed iron ore, bronze slag and lead monoxide imply metal-working activity. An early 2nd-millennium date has been proposed, on the basis of the pottery and the possibility that the oval-shaped stone may indicate a S Aegean influence. In 1995 excavations were carried out at the V. Bamboura plot on the main Prinos-Potos road, approximately 200m W of the church of Sotiros. A wall running in a SW-NE direction was uncovered 0.70m below the surface. It was built with large blocks of masonry worked on the exterior, E side and with a fill of small stones and mud on the inte- rior; it is thus probably a foundation wall. To the E of the wall was located a large number of pieces of pottery and roof tiles. This is not considered to be a compact destruction level but rather signifies a , ? disturbed archaeological earth fill. This also meant - that no vases were preserved complete, with the ' c. exception of a handle-less skyphidio of most prob- ably local Thasian production dating to the 2nd quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. The most common types of vase were lekanes, jars and a few 'frying pans.' Two bg Attic skyphoi and a third rf one date the site's use at least from the 320s BC. Seven of the amphora handles bear inscriptions, of which three 160. Thase preserve names: Polyneikes, Pythion, Prixipolis. These date from the early 3rd Ct BC (ADelt 620-621). An olive press of the 4th-6th Cts AD was found at this site in 1998; at a much lower level beneath it was located a 6th- Ct BC settlement which almost exclusively used only hand- made pottery (Epyov YHHIO 2, 123). A section of a dry-stone wall running in a N-S direction was found at Kaloyeriko 0.20m below the surface. A stone- paved floor was found directly to the W, built with large lime- stone tiles with smaller stones wedged in the cracks. This floor was plastered over with a mixture of sand and gravel and sug- gests that this area was probably used for storage in mod. times, perhaps for one of the old olive presses nearby. This floor was removed, revealing two EHL building phases: the later phase was represented by a SW-NE wall in the W section 0.40m below the surface, whilst 0.40m below to the E of this was an earlier SW-NE wall. The pottery fragments here were almost exclusively of local ware: amphoras, lekanes, jars, skyphidia. Eight stamped handles, three of which bore the names Amphandros, Aischrion and Herakleides respectively, date the site to between 280 and 260 BC. (ADelt 621-622) Treis Gremoi. This HL site, ca 5km SW of Limena, the island's capital, already discussed in AR 1999-2000, 104-105, is reported upon in ADelt 622-6, with a plan (Fig. 160). In 1995 work to open up a road through the forest near Theologos, a traditional village on the N slope of the hill bear- ing the church of the Agioi Anargiroi, destroyed two pithos burials and a grave cut into the natural rock. The pithoi, with dimensions of 0.95 x 1.10m and 0.55 x 0.75m respectively, were almost completely destroyed. No skeletal remains were found within them and only two of the few pottery sherds were decorated, one in the Wild Goat style which was common in the E Aegean in the first quarter of the 6th Ct BC. No other burials or signs of habitation were found nearby, although the location of these pithoi is evidence of early relations of the highland areas with the city, coastal areas and Aegean region. The rock-cut tomb revealed the excellently-preserved skeleton of an adult male, with a few pottery sherds and a bronze ring. It most likely dates to the Byz period. (ADelt 627) R. os, Treis Gremoi site Excavation to widen the Limenas-Prinos road brought to light an ECh burial structure at Tsoukalario. The structure consists of a projecting semi-circular apse, a single cruciform chamber and side aisles. This was divided into compartments (1-2m long) for interment of burials. A tiny MByz church (5.50 x 4.50m) was built in the middle of the structure, utilising the apse. (AEMTH 11, 609-16) THRACE Abdera. The new museum acquired laboratories and adminis- trative offices in 1993, and is now functional in terms of both its administrative operations and archaeological research (con- servation, recording, photography, etc.). The transfer of finds from other museums and storerooms in the region continued. (ADelt 641) By 1999, the main exhibition area had been set up, with finds from the 6th Ct BC to the 13th Ct AD. The museum was opened by the Minister of Culture on 20 January 2000. (Epyov YHH0 3, 142). The archaeological area of anc. Abdera was cleaned and its appearance improved. (Epyov YHH702, 127) An account is given in AR 1999-2000, 106, of the discov- ery of 29 tombs in the region of the anc. cemetery of Abdera between 1993-1995, primarily due to the redistribution of agricultural holdings in the village of Velone. ADelt 641-657 also includes an exhaustive and detailed report by Dina Kallintzi of all these tombs. Here we make reference to a selection of them. Hortolivado, old land-holding of G. Zambakis. This was a previously pillaged tomb with a sarcophagus (1.96 x 0.66m) made of local clay, found 0.23m beneath the current surface of the soil and covered with a slab made of the same material. Any burial offerings within the sarcophagus had been pillaged, although a few small bones belonging to a person of indetermi- nate sex aged 16-17 years were found. On the E next to the sar- cophagus a bf lekythos was found preserved entire, although with</page><page sequence="108">108 DAVID BLACKMAN many cracks. It depicts a departing warrior scene and dates to the late 6th Ct BC. Lagotopos. A pillaged sarcophagus of local stone was found at the top of a small tumulus which had been almost flat- tened by agricultural work. The tomb had been previously excavated and was found then to be intact, although without any grave offerings or skeletal remains. Around the sarcopha- gus were a few fragments of bg ware, presumably burial offer- ings. The dump created by the pillagers and the section dug by the archaeologists contained large fragments of pottery, includ- ing a bg pyxis with its lid (ADelt PI. 197a), a rf aryballos- shaped lekythos, two bg bolsals, a piece from a rf skyphos, a small fragment of a glass vessel and a section of a bronze stem. These finds are all dated to the 5th Ct BC. Four burials were found close to each other under or near the S peripheral road of Velone. Burial I, another sarcophagus of local stone (ext. 2.22 x 0.70m, int. 2.04 x 0.54m) was found on the old field ofVasilis Imanides. The sarcophagus had been pillaged and destroyed and its cover slab was missing. It had an E-W orientation and contained a very few bone fragments which belonged to a person of indeterminate gender, aged 16-17 years. Pottery fragments found around the sarcophagus date it to the 5th Ct BC. Burial II was a clay larax, 28m from burial I. There were no remains within the larax, nor any bur- ial offerings, even though there were no signs of pillaging. Outside, on the larax's narrow SW side, there were burial offerings of various clay vessels dating from the late 6 th to early 5th Cts BC, which had been smashed when the burial cer- emony took place. Burial III, another clay larax, was also found nearby (int. 1.95 x 0.40m, d. 0.21); the lid, which was constructed in two sections, had fallen in and crushed the skeleton inside. The skull was found in the SE of the tomb. The dead, a girl of ca 15 years, had been laid on her back with her arms stretched out at her sides. A clay pyxis with painted dec- oration had been placed upright near the skull, although it had tipped downwards slightly. The scattered fragments of other vessels were also found in this section. These may have been from offerings which had been placed outside of the larax, in contact with its SE wall, and which subsequently fell inside. Burial IV was a cremation burial within a hydria, found 20m E of burial I, a few centimetres below the surface in an upright position. The cremated skeletal remains indicated a woman (?), aged 17-25 years. At Palaiochora a burial pithos (max. h. 1.72m, max. di. 1.13m) was found in the former field of Athanasios Katsikos, 0.30m below the surface. It was in a horizontal position with the mouth of the pithos pointing E and the bottom had a layer of red clayey earth mixed with small stones and a layer of sea pebbles and shells above this. The dead, of indeterminate gen- der, aged ca 6 years, was placed on top of this, with the skull to the E and the hands stretched out by the sides; parts of the skeleton were missing. The offerings, which were placed around the body, included: a gold-inlaid burial wreath, made of a gold-inlaid ebony stem to which were attached bronze gold- inlaid leaf-shaped plates and thin bronze stems with gold-inlaid clay seed-shaped attachments. Fragments of an iron strigil, a small bg skyphos and the base of a clay figurine were found, although it is doubted whether this last was a burial offering and it has been suggested by the excavators that it was a child's toy. An earthenware pithos containing another interment was found in the former field of P. Anagnostopoulos. The burial was very similar to that described above. The skeletal remains suggest that it was of a woman aged 25-30 years. Various burial offerings distributed around her included two iron strigils, two small bronze rings, a bronze signet-ring, a clay aryballos-shaped lekythos, a bronze object, perhaps the neck of an aryballos and four clay disks with a relief repre- sentation of a gorgon on one side. These were found in the area of the skull and were probably attached to a textile head- band. Two vases had originally been placed on top of the pithos as burial offerings. The sides of the pithos had, how- ever, collapsed with the result that these two vessels had fall- en inside and were found in among the other fragments. The burial is dated to the 4th Ct BC. A rock-cut cist tomb, labelled burial II, was also found at Palaichora. It had been covered with two or three covering slabs of which the two on the E side were recovered. This was a shallow tomb, the side walls being 0.48m high. The dead, a male of around 28 years, was buried on his back with his head to the E; much of the skeleton was missing. A metal object (a dagger or strigil) was found in contact with the fingers of the right hand and had presumably been held by the dead. Other burials were also found at Xerovryse in addition to those described in AR 1999-2000. Burial I was a sarcophagus made of local stone with an E-W orientation. The weight of the earth above had caused the walls to crack and collapse some- what. Despite this, the sarcophagus was unpillaged. The skull was found detached in the E section and the detached lower limbs were in the W section. The skeleton was that of an adult of around 45 years and of indeterminate sex. The sarcophagus also contained the burial offering of a bronze strigil. Some small stones which bore traces of burning were found outside the sarcophagus in the NE corer. There were fragments of broken vessels along the W section of the N side, at various levels above the level of the sarcophagus. This indi- cates that the vessels had been deposited whilst the sarcopha- gus was in the process of being covered by soil. The burial is dated to the 1 st half of the 5th century BC. Burials II and III were interments in earthenware pithoi: II is of an individual of indeterminate gender of 25-35 years, and III is most probably a male aged 19-25 years; both date to the 1 st half of the 5th century BC. The two burials must either have been simultaneous or the second was made with precise knowledge of the first, since they are very close to each other and the position of burial II is influenced by the position of burial III. Burial IV was in another clay larnakes which had broken up into many pieces, although it was of good quality material and production (ext. 2.64 x 0.645m, int. 1.815 x 0.407m; walls 0.29m high, 0.03m thick). It was richly decorated on the upper part of its side walls: the internal wall had a relief with an Ionic egg-and-dart moulding framed below by a band of astragaloi. There was a similar moulding and astragalos design on the exterior wall, although this was much larger and more pro- nounced. The upper part of the rim was framed by a band of lotus leaves with honeysuckle intertwined (ADelt P1. 197y). This is the first time that a clay larnax decorated on the upper part of its rim has been discovered in Abdera. A fair number of the bones had been preserved, but these were not in good con- dition. The dead person, who had been buried face upwards with the hands down by the sides, was of indeterminate gender, aged around 35 years. No burial goods were found, although the tomb had not been pillaged. The larnax was taken to Abdera museum to be restored and exhibited. Many other similar burials were also found during the redistribution of land-holdings in 1993-1995 in the village of Velone. These were at the sites of Lofos ton Skion, Stani, Lofos ton Koritsion, Lofos ton Tsakalion, Almyri Limni and Ambelia. (ADelt 641-657) In 1997, during work for the opening up of a canal at Hortolivado, 76 anc. tombs were found, 18 of which were</page><page sequence="109">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 109 destroyed in the process; 44 of the tombs were excavated and were found to date from the late 6th to the early 5th Cts BC. Another group of 19 tombs to the N of these was found to date from the late 7th to the early 5th Cts BC. The burials are a mix- ture of open burials, clay laraxs, pithos burials and cist graves with cremations; 54% of the burials were open burials, and this is the first time in the region of Abdera that the proportion of open burials has been found to be so high. Most of the burials were without offerings, although there were many votive offer- ings, primarily vases, in the vicinity of the burials. The exca- vators have dated the beginning of this cemetery on the basis of the pottery finds to the late 7thearly 6th Cts BC and believe that this is the fourth cemetery of the Klazomenians at Abdera and is connected with the early colonists. (AEMTH 11, 633-44) Kossynthos. Illegal sand removal from the river Kossynthos near Xanthi in the summer of 1998 led to the excavation of several archaeological finds. The discovery of an EIA burial pithos led to the discovery of two other pithoi of a similar date. Burial I was found near the N bank of the river, a few centimetres below today's river bed, near the village of Vafeika. It was placed horizontally with its mouth, which has not been preserved, facing SW. The mouth had been sealed with river pebbles and the pithos had been made of low qual- ity clay. The greatest preserved height of the pithos is 2.05m and the greatest width 1.26m. The pithos contained three adult burials, all three skulls being found near the mouth. The mid- dle burial (B) was of a woman aged 35-45 who had been buried on her back with her hands lying parallel along the body. The other two skeletons must have been positioned in the same way, although this is not clear from the remains. The skeleton on the right (A) belonged to a male aged over 45 years and the other burial (F) was of a woman aged 18-23 years. It was difficult to allocate the burial finds, aside from a well-preserved sword, 0.54m long, which must have belonged to the man and was placed along his left side. A knife was found beneath the skull of the middle skeleton. Two ringlets were found around the upper part of skeleton F. The pithos was surrounded by a stone surround of which only the E sec- tion is preserved and which was secured in place with river pebbles. Burial II, also a pithos, was found on the S bank of the river 268m SE from and directly opposite burial I and had original- ly been buried at the same level as burial I. It was also hori- zontally positioned with the mouth in a SE direction. The lower part of the pithos had been washed away by the waters the pre- vious winter. The mouth had been sealed by a piece of schist. The pithos contained one skeleton, which had been placed directly onto the side walls on its back with the hands along the sides and the head on the side of the mouth of the pithos. The skeleton was in a good condition, although the lower part of the legs had been washed away by the waters. The dead was a male of 37-38 years, whose burial offerings consisted of a silver buckle and a silver knife which were found deposited between the bones of the pelvis and the right hand. Burial III, another pithos burial, was found in the river bed, near the village of Polysito. It appears that this pithos was cut down the middle before it was deposited and the dead was thus buried in half a pot. There were no burial goods within and the skeleton had almost all been swept away by the river. All that remained was a piece from a long bone, perhaps the thigh bone of a child. Two IA cups had been placed on each side of the mouth, dating to the early 8th Ct BC. A clay processing workshop was found 795m E of burial III, the remains consisting of a structure and two groups of sherds. The structure was found in the middle of today's river bed and was ellipsoid (1. 3.53m, w. 2.45m); it was quite shal- low, the greatest depth being 0.20m. It was made of baked clay which was burnt in parts and covered with a layer of clayey and fine chestnut-coloured earth. Stones were placed around the edge and the whole was covered with clay again. The struc- ture had a curved bottom with two shallow hollows in the S. There were traces of fossilized wood and burning in one of the hollows. The structure was filled with pieces of baked and burnt clay, pebbles and stones. There were also pieces of vari- ous vessels (e.g. the bases) and fragments of pithoi. In the inte- rior there were also two metal sheets, a metal stem (an arrow?), an iron stalk and, around the outside of the structure, a bone tool (a spatula?). The two groups of pithos fragments were found on the S bank of the river, to the W of the structure. It is judged by the excavators that these groups of pithoi constitute evidence for two cemeteries (one near the village of Vafeika, the other near Polysito) and that the settlements with which they were associated are buried in the alluvial river deposits. The inhabitants of the known IA settlements in the Kossynthos region belonged to the Thracian tribe of the Bistones. (AEMTH 12, 1-18) Lade, Didymoteichon. A burial tumulus was explored in the last few months of 1998 at the site of Vergi, NW of the village of Lade, in a rescue excavation. The tumulus had a diameter of around 40m and a height of ca 4.5m. The fill was of earth of a different colour and texture from the natural earth, and had obviously been placed on top of it. The remains of burial offer- ings and pyres were discovered in the S part of the tumulus, having been deposited on the natural ground level. Three shaft graves were also uncovered. Tomb A held an infant aged 6-9 months, tomb F a child of 6-7 years and tomb B an adult male of 55-65, accompanied only by a pointed iron tool. The votive pottery remains and a bronze oil-lamp date the burials to the 1st Ct AD. A pit was discovered in the central section of the tumulus. Of irregular concentric shape (di. 3.20m-3.65m, d. 0.30m-0.40m), it was dug straight into the natural earth and lined with a thin layer of red earth. Another, orthogonal, pit had been dug out in its centre and contained the remains of a cre- mation. The cremation must have been carried out elsewhere and the remains then deposited here, as there are no signs of burning within the tumulus. Pieces of charcoal and of wood from the funeral pyre were found along with the remains of the person who had been cremated. The burial offerings had been placed on top of these and consisted of an iron sword with a bone handle, three iron spear-heads, a gold diadem, gold and silver sheets, a gold mouthpiece, clay and glass vessels, as well as several small iron and bronze finds, such as stems, sheets, rings, brooches, etc. This is the first time that a gold mouth- piece has been found in Greek Thrace, the only other mouth- piece found in the area being silver and dating to the 5th Ct BC. The gold diadem had the facade of a Doric building imprinted upon it, with two pediments. There was an image of a gorgon on the pediments, and the mouthpiece was decorated with a similar design. Several small clay and glass vessels, one of which was a perfume-holder, had been placed outside the S corer of the rectangular pit. None of these burial offerings showed signs of burning, suggesting that they had been placed there after the bone and wood remains had been deposited in the pit. The anthropological study of the bones has not yet been completed, although preliminary findings suggest that the dead was a male. A 1 t-Ct AD date has also been given for the cremation, on the basis of the vase evidence.</page><page sequence="110">110 DAVID BLACKMAN 161. Lade: burial tumulus Another shaft grave (burial D) was discovered in the fill of the W section of the mound, ca 1m above the level of the cre- mation. This burial was of a young woman aged 16-20 years. The only object which accompanied her was a simple bronze ring. This burial must have been made during the construction of the tumulus or later. The tumulus was constructed in two phases. A small mound was originally built (di. 25m), covering the three shaft graves in the S sector. The burial pit with the cremation was later dug on the periphery of this original mound and this was then covered to create a much larger tumulus (Fig. 161). A brief forensic and palaeopathological report on the burials by Anagnostis Agelarakis is also given. (AEMTH 12, 19-29) Makre ( lkm W of Alexandroupoli). Work continued on the PR settlement of Makri (sector B). The primary aim this year was to excavate some of the areas on the periphery of the set- tlement. The secondary aims were to explore the geology of the region and the geomorphology of the mound and to collect information on the past environment and the economy and also on more specialized activities, such as pottery and stone-work- ing. Successive floors of exceptional quality and in an excellent state of preservation were uncovered around the perimeter. They belonged to pillared buildings, as did the hearths, pits and certain unknown structures that were found in the same area (ADelt P1. 198 y). A shallow pit with sections of a child's skull was found next to one of the floors. This is the fourth N burial to have been found at Makri. The arrangement of a number of the pillar-holes suggests a structure supported by pillars with a smaller, circular pillar-supported structure in the interior. (ADelt 661-2) Mesembria-anc. Zone. Detailed accounts of this site have been given in AR 1997-98, 98 and AR 1999-2000, 108. The excavations in 1999 uncovered a section of road and a founda- tion of a large circular building on the NE edge of the city. A section of another road was uncovered in the centre of the city. (Epyov YIII03, 143) Paliohora, near Maroneia. A small MByz church was located within the ECh basilica on the site (AEMTH 11, 645-61; see also AEMTH 8, 359-70). The single-aisle structure contained a synthronon and column supports for the altar and prothesis table. Moveable finds included part of a processional cross, pottery, inscriptions, a lead seal of an episkeptites, oil lamp fragments, etc. These suggest an association with the nearby church on the site of Synaxis. Pherres. An extensive LByz cemetery site is reported at the Triphyllones site. Cist and pit graves predominate. Grave finds included mostly plain pottery. The cemetery appears to have been used for a limited period, and may have been intended for the population of a nearby settlement. It was evidently well arranged and the graves carefully prepared. (ADelt 683-4) Psila Vourla. The remains of an anc. building were found at this site near anc. Abdera during the laying down of new roads. These were three walls of a four-walled structure, one of which runs in a NE-SW direction (1. 1.50m, extant h. 1.03m, w. 0.60m), and the other two walls perpendicular to it. A destruc- tion layer of compact roof tiles was found in the W comer of the area. The interior has not, however, been fully excavated and so it has not been possible to determine to what extent it is covered by this destruction level. Four 3rd-Ct BC bronze coins were found in the immediate vicinity which, along with the tiles, date the building, perhaps a farmstead, to the 3rd Ct BC. (ADelt 652) Regio. A report on the work at this PR site 9km NE of Didymoteichon was given in AR 1999-2000, 109. ADelt 662-4 gives more details, and a view of tomb F(Pl. 1991), and the tray containing the burial offerings for tomb B (PI. 199y). Samothrace. James McCredie (ASCS) reports on the 2000 study and conservation season at the sanctuary of the Great Gods.: 'East Hill: marble blocks from the Dedication of Philip and Alexander were relocated, renumbered, drawn, photographed and studied in preparation for the final publication of the build- ing by Prof. Wescoat. Final reconstruction drawings of that building were prepared. Context pottery from various parts of Eastern Hill was examined, catalogued and prepared for publi- cation. Hall of Choral Dancers (former Temenos): A detailed ele- vation of the E side of the building was worked out and drawn. A study of the frieze based on find spots of all extant fragments was prepared. Museum: Pottery and glass on exhibit, which had been restored with obsolete techniques, was disassembled and restored according to present standards. Architectural restora- tions whose appearance had deteriorated were repaired. Metal objects in the museum and in storage were treated, and all were protected. A database of all coins recovered in the excavations was prepared, and a scheme developed for storing them in the coin cabinet of the Ephorate; modifications to that cabinet were made, and sample drawers were installed.' Spelaio, Evros. In 1997, two rescue excavations were carried out on two burial tumuli which lie 200m apart near the village of Spelaio. Tumulus A was excavated by Domna Terzopoulou and tumulus B by Diamantis Triantafillos. A report on tumulus B by D. Triantafillos appears in AEMTH 11, 625-32. It con- sisted of a four-sided pit with a cremation dating to the 2nd Ct AD. The burial offerings included clay and glass vessels, frag- ments of gold sheeting, an iron ring and a folding chair, the second such to have been found in Thrace. The tumulus (di. ca 35m, h. ca 4.5m) was constructed directly upon the natural</page><page sequence="111">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 111 sand gravel with fills of different types of earth. Later crema- tions and burials were also located. The area was first used in the IA, ca 9th-8th Cts BC, and a refuse pit of this period was found in the N edge of the tumulus. A similar pit was found in the neighbouring tumulus A. The pits contained hand-made pottery with grooved decoration and horn-like protrusions. The tumulus also contained many Byz burials, apparently dated to the 9th Ct by a lead seal of Marianos magistros and anthypatos. This is said to be one of the first tumuli used in the 3rd/4th Cts to be re-used in the 9th. (AEMTH 11, 625-32) Anc. Stryme. Excavations were carried at this site in the Nome of Rhodope. This was a Thasian colony founded in the 2nd half of the 7th Ct BC, 25km SW of modem Komotene. There had been limited excavations or rescue excavations in past decades but systematic excavations were only properly started in the summer of 1995. The primary aim of these excavations was to confirm the identity of the anc. city, and to determine the chronological limits of its habitation, its layout and the location of its public buildings. Four excavation sectors were opened up. Ploughing of the land meant that the earth was very disturbed and that the architectural members could be located very near the surface. Several bronze coins were found, including a num- ber from Maroneia (of the early 4th Ct BC), a silver coin from the same city (411/410-398/7 BC), a silver coin from Neapolis dating to 500 BC and a bronze coin from Macedonia (after 311 BC). A refuse pit (di. 2m, opening 1.10m, d. ca 0.70m) was located. In it were found fragments of amphoras and other ves- sels, animal bones and shells. Seven of the amphoras could be fully restored and it appears on preliminary examination that they are from a Thasian workshop and date to the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC. Another amphora is from a Samian workshop and dates to the 4th Ct BC. Three of the restored amphoras are from a Chiot workshop, two dating to the 3rd quarter of the 5th Ct BC and the other to the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC. Another amphora was from a Lesbian workshop, dating to the early 5th Ct BC. (ADelt 657-659) Rescue excavations of burial mounds in the region of Metriko near anc. Stryme were limited in 1995 to one low mound not far to the NE of Lake Elos. The mound had a diam- eter of 30m and a height of 1.25m. A tomb stele and pottery burial offerings were discovered, but no burial was found. Of interest was a pit dug into the earth at the base of the mound (opening ca im, d. 1.16m). The pit contained fragments of amphoras and a few animal bones. Similar pits have been found in burial tumuli in Bulgaria and have been interpreted as being of a ceremonial nature, perhaps connected with the per- formance of a liturgy by a priest. (ADelt 659) AEMTH 10b, 927-48 includes an article by Diamantis Triantafillos and Domna Terzopoulou on the burial tumuli that have been excavated in Greek Thrace since 1984, in addition to those excavated in Bulgarian and Turkish Thrace since the late 19th Ct. The authors comment upon what these tumuli might reveal of the interaction between Greeks and Thracians in anc. Thrace, and the spread of anc. Greek language, religion and art. Traianoupolis. Improvements on the Thessalonike-Yefira Kipon road provided the opportunity for a rescue excavation at the cemetery here in summer 1995. In all, 13 tombs dating to the 5th Ct AD were explored (5 shaft graves, 2 covered tombs, 5 cist tombs and a built cist tomb). Twelve contained adult burials whilst only one contained a child burial. On the whole, the tombs did not contain votive offerings. (ADelt 664) NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS Agios Efstratios An enormous pithos from the sea, 80cm in height and diame- ter, was handed in to the EMA. (Epyov Yn-O 3, 167) Chios Town. Just N of the city mills and tanneries, important monu- ments of industrial archaeology probably cover remains of anc. harbour installations. The W part of the main harbour was dredged under archaeological observation. No anc. remains were found. An illegally constructed embankment at Bella Vista just S of the mod. harbour probably covers the S mole of the anc. harbour. The coastal area off the mod. airport was also dredged, with no anc. remains found. (ADelt 850-1) Evangelistrias district, Chios Museum site. When drainage work was done on foundations which had been dam- aged by subterranean water, excavation was undertaken in the W section of the museum's yard. The investigation reached a depth of 4.5m and revealed a section of the HL cemetery of Chios which extends to the E slope of the low Evangelistrias Hill where the museum is situated. Investigated to a depth of 3 or 4m and within a stone-built peribolos wall were four sarcophagi (I-IV) made of red-yellow Thymiana stone (1.82 x 0.8m; 1.8 x l.lm; 2.2 x 0.85m; 1.82 x 0.9m), four free burials (ETI-ETIV) in the ground and two enchytrismoi, one of them in an amphora placed on the cover slab of grave II. Only the N section of the peribolos wall remains intact to a length of 4.5m, built of asymmetrical stones and re-used bricks. All graves were oriented E-W and the grave offerings consisted of loom-weights, coins, small phialai, scent bottles, a hydriske, an iron comb, 47 iron pins, a round bronze earring, a bracelet with bronze beads, 24 iron nails and an iron link. Gialourika District. During trenching work for the laying of foundations (D. and G. Tsipourli plot), a section of the A necropolis came to light. Ten burials in poorly preserved, sim- ple clay trapezoidal sarcophagi of the Clazomenian type were investigated (max. I. 1.75m-2m, max. w. 0.65m, rim w. 0.1m). These were sealed with a clay cover slab and placed in recess- es in the natural rock, randomly oriented (E-W, NE-SW, N-S) according to the formation of the ground. The grave offerings included 2 trefoil oinochoai, 9 jugs, an unidentifiable bronze object and two small vessels. Kofina District. In the course of trial trenching on Odos Ieronimou Gorgia 21 (Panteli Kostalou property) a large store of pottery was located in a cavity of the soft, porous natural rock, at a depth of 0.4m-0.6m below the pavement of the adja- cent road. The fill contained asymmetrical stones, gravel and porous rock fragments. Found in the fill of the apothetes, lm in depth, were unpainted storage pottery sherds, amphora knobs and handles, bg pottery sherds, fish plates, phialai, lenticular and pyramidal loom-weights, a stamped loom-weight, a cone- shaped loom-weight, bg lamp fragments, intact lamps, kylix sherds, a section of an A skyphos, a bronze coin and roof-tile fragments. The apothetes extends into the adjacent property where further investigation is not feasible at present. During extensive excavation work on Odos Koundouriotou 50 (Evangelou Asmani plot) a group of four graves (I-IV) was uncovered. The dead were placed in sarcophagi of Thymiana- type stone with gabled cover slabs (max. I. 2.2m, max. w. 0.9m). In graves I and II redeposited bones of earlier burials were found, whereas the remains of the later burials were found on a stratum of stones and tiles. Grave offerings were present in all graves and consisted of bulbous and spindle-shaped scent bottles.</page><page sequence="112">112 DAVID BLACKMAN 162. Kato Phana: trench V 163. Kato Phana: wall 6 Letsaina District. During the cutting of trial trenches on Odos Ramnis 42 (Kefalonika plot), a group of graves belong- ing to an ER necropolis were uncovered (it is well known that the cemetery of the anc. town, and also pottery and sculpture workshops, are situated in this district). The archaeological investigation which followed brought to light four sarcophagi (oriented NE-SW) made of Thymiana-type stone with rectan- gular cover slabs made of the same stone and a well-built peri- bolos wall which was investigated to a length of 7.95m. Grave I, situated at ground level, has a vaulted roof and contains the earlier sarcophagi I and II. It is built of large and small asymmetrical mortared stones. The sarcophagi and wall (T%1) are situated on a high embankment of breccia and large HL domestic pottery, jars, etc. With the exception of grave I the graves contained more than one burial. The burials which are dated to the 1st Ct AD, included grave offerings of clay spindle-shaped scent bottles, a bronze mirror, a clay scent bottle, three gold wire pieces, a miniature bone vessel, bronze belt fittings, a coin, bronze plates in relief and clay bulbous scent bottles. Agios Dimitrios Hill. In December 1994 the Forest Service carried out an illegal excavation on the slope of Agios Dimitrios Hill, a site which has been known since 1915 for the existence of an extensive A cemetery (ADelt 1, 67-71). The rescue excavation which followed in 1995, uncovered 10 buri- als in clay Clazomenian-type sarcophagi (I-X) and an enchytrismos in two amphoras, the pieces of which had been fitted together. Eight sarcophagi measured 2 x 0.78m. Burials I-VII contained grave offerings such as hydriskai, oinochoiskai, a bronze mirror and cups. Burials VIII-X con- tained child burials. Emporio. Plans were elaborated for the promotion of the archaeological site of Prophetes Elias (Athena sanctuary and houses of the 7th and 6th Cts BC). The Ministry for the Aegean financed the clearing of the plateau on which the temple of Athena and the megaron are situated. Dwellings were cleared of undergrowth and a footpath was cut which partly retraces the path of the anc. roadway. (ADelt 685-8) Kardamyla. Many fragments of C and HL amphoras (mainly Chian, also LR) were found off the W breakwater of the port of Marmaro, probably dumped by fishermen cleaning their nets; reported to have been found off Strovili islet. (ADelt 851-2) Phana. Agia Marina District. During the clearing of undergrowth on the Gianniris plot near the chapel of Agia Marina where K. Kourouniotis had found architectural mem- bers of an A temple which he identified with that of Herakles and Dionysos (ADelt 1, 85), 13 architectural members of an Ionic A building were uncovered. On the W border of the plot the investigation uncovered a structure built of re-used unfluted column-drums. The drums and the architectural members probably belong to the same building. Following approval from the Local Council for Island Monuments, walls 1 and 2, which were of poor quality, were demolished, given that no other building remains were found and that the four unfluted drums from wall 2 were trans- ferred to Chios Museum. In the course of the investigation it was recorded that under- neath the chapel of Agia Marina (on the adjoining Papadopoulos property, S of the Gianniris plot) there exists a foundation built of rectangular blocks, which probably belongs to the temple. Kato Phana. Mrs Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri and Dr Lesley Beaumont report on the 2000 fieldwork season at ancient Phanai: 'Archaeological excavation was carried out as a collaborative venture between the 20th EPCA and the BSA. This year saw the continuation of exploration, begun in October 1999, of the SW quadrant of the sanctuary of Apollo Phanaios. To date, five 5 x 5m2 trenches have been opened. The latest levels, being LR/EByz in date, are probably con- temporary with the ECh basilica at the site. Trench V, opened to the E of the basilica narthex, has so far produced rich LR/EByz strata, important for understanding the later history of the site. A complex of walls was uncovered, oriented N-S and E-W and constructed of stone rubble bound together by mortar and incorporating reused building material from the Apollo sanctuary, such as a half column drum (82cm di.) (Fig. 162). Further work is necessary here to determine the nature of these walls particularly in view of their close proximity to the basilica, and to reach and explore the older underlying strata. Finds included a wealth of LR and EByz pottery, glass, iron nails, lead weight and bronze items. Julian Baker has identified a well-preserved coin as a half follis or twenty nummi of Heraclius, minted at Thessaloniki in AD 618/19. Earlier rich levels uncovered at the site belong to the A period, with the intervening C and HL periods thus far evading enquiry. Trenches III and IV revealed a series of walls. Wall 6, oriented NW-SE, (th. 1.82m, preserved h. 1.6m), is carefully constructed from closely packed, medium-sized, semi-worked limestone blocks and probably forms a part of the early A peri- bolos wall of the sanctuary (Fig. 163). Wall 7, built in part at least of larger unworked limestone blocks, runs parallel to wall 6 some 2.3m to the W. This may belong to the later A peribo- los wall construction, though further work is required to clari-</page><page sequence="113">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 113 fy the nature of the structure. Between the two walls was exca- vated a wealth of A pottery and small finds. The pottery includ- ed quantities of white-slipped Chian fine ware, such as frag- mentary chalices, and coarser storage vessels in 6th-Ct mono- chrome grey ware, common at this time in the NE Aegean region. Metal finds consisted of bronze, iron and lead, and included bronze tweezers, fish hook, coin and part of what may be a bronze belt. The excavation of trench II, adjacent to the N, continued from 1999. Below LR/EByz levels were found deep levels of fill, still to be explained, which overlie A strata. In addition to distinctive A Chian pottery, a wall oriented NW-SE may be the continuation of wall 6, which itself is tentatively identified as belonging to the early A peribolos wall system and is located in trench IV, adjacent on the S. Further work here is, however, required to clarify this matter: it is, for example, possible that we are instead dealing with an earlier phase of wall 6.' Mesta Harbour (Pasa Limani). A marina was illegally constructed on this fine natural harbour; it may cover anc. or Genoese harbour structures. (ADelt 852) Lemnos In the straits between Lemnos and Imbros remains of a wreck in 8m of water on the Methones Shoals were reported by fish- ermen, with ca 50 iron cannon and two enormous iron anchors. The wreck dates probably from the Crimean War, or perhaps 1770 (operations of Orloff). (ADelt 848) Anaphane (Nipas Myrina Beach Hotel). Investigation of the shallow water near the sanctuary of Artemis-Selene dis- covered a rubble bank 30m long and 50m wide: its anc. date is not certain. (ADelt 849) Hephaisteia. Kokkinovrachos site-A Necropolis (ASAtene 15-16 [1932-33]). Following the report made by the guard of the site about illicit excavations, the Ephorate conducted res- cue excavations of visible graves in the area. An enchytrismos in a pithos was excavated, which contained burnt bones and two 5th-Ct BC lekythoi, one of which was rf depicting a female figure (2nd half of 5th Ct BC). The excavation also yielded a bf skyphos and pithos fragments. The collaboration between the 20th EPCA and the Italian School of Archaeology continued in 1995 with excavation work on the archaeological sites of Poliochni and Hephaisteia. At Hephaisteia, in preparation for the consolidation and restoration of the architectural remains, extensive cleaning work was car- ried out in the baths area (Laurenzi excavation), a section of a house of late antiquity, the theatre and a section of the fortifica- tion wall. G. Messineo (Italian School) reports on the 2000 study sea- son, on the material collected from the site in 1998, and kept in the Poliochni storerooms: 'A brief examination showed that the material in the spoil heap from the 1930 Adriani-Parlanti excavation near the tower, had probably been already examined and dumped. The few fragments of any interest must have fallen into the trench fill with the demolition of the earthen walls around the excavation. Most of this is gray bucchero, which was found in large quan- tities in the excavation. The finds that had been collected from the surface in the area of the isthmus walls during the re-examination of the excavation in 1994, were cleaned and studied. This material includes a fragment from a glazed skyphos, with white linear decoration, characteristic of the production of Mytilene and Pergamon.' Koukkonisi. The collaborative excavation between the 20th EPCA and H. Boulotis, archaeologist-researcher of the Athens Academy, continued this year at the PR settlement of Koukkonisi, a small islet within the bay of Moudros, joined to the coastline by a narrow roadway. Since the surrounding sea is shallow and marshy it is presumed that in antiquity Koukkonisi was connected to the coast by a small peninsula. The investigation began in 1992 and continued in 1994. This year's excavation continued an existing trench and started a new adjoining one, both on the highest point of the islet near the trigonometric point of the Army Geographical Service. Work carried out in the NW comer of the trench uncov- ered, at a depth of 2m, a section of a vaulted construction with successive occupation floors. According to the stratigraphy it is certain that the pithos room belongs to the latest and highest phase of the vaulted building which, based on the finds uncov- ered, can be dated to the Yellow Period of Poliochni. S of its longest wall and oriented in the same direction, a contemporary narrow roadway was uncovered. Here a clay, smooth-surfaced figurine was found. The newly-cut trench uncovered a section of a rectangular room with two architectural phases which correspond to the Brown Period of Poliochni. On the floor of the earlier phase an abundance of pottery was found whose characteristic feature is the carinated wheel-thrown bowls of the Brown Period. Inscribed MH pottery was also found, as well as a plethora of flint chips which indicate stone-working activity. In the later architectural phase of the room a sealed door- way (in the S longitudinal wall) and a pithos in the SW comer were uncovered. The pottery here was clearly less, and is dated to the early phase of the Brown Period; an intact hydria with plastic and incised decoration was among the finds. This phase lies above architectural remains which are dated to the Yellow Period of Poliochni and contemporary with the vaulted struc- ture. (ADelt 694) Moudros Bay. Nea Koutale. A large collection of antiqui- ties raised by sponge fishermen and held in the village clinic include Chian, Thasian, Lesbian, Rhodian and S Italian amphoras of C and HL date, LR and Byz amphoras and lead anchor stocks. (ADelt 849) Myrina. The identity of the anc. and mod. harbour has been argued by C. Marangou (Tropis 3, 309-19): A Simossi thinks the anc. harbour was probably at Nea Madytos. (ADelt 848) At Richa Nera (K. and H. Tsatsou plot) a trial excavation was carried out for the expropriation of the plot since it is sit- uated within the boundaries of the PR settlement of Myrina and adjacent to plots which have already been expropriated. (ADelt 42, 476-77; 43, 465; 44, 409) A 4m x 4m trench was cut, to a depth of 2m. The trench uncovered a section of solid construction, probably a wall, given that it is 4m long and at least 3-3.5m wide, with at least two successive faces, built of semi-worked stones. These stones are uncommonly large with relation to the PR settlement architecture of the island. Between the outer and inner wall face there is a conglomeration of unworked stones, pebbles and broken re-used millstones. The wall is oriented NW-SE. Precisely above the surviving surface of the wall a layer of clean earth (ca 0.2m thick) was found containing a large quan- tity of yellow clay which appears to be the residue of dissolved, unbaked bricks. The conglomeration fill produced identifiable pottery sherds which date the structure to the Late Blue period of Poliochni. However, due to limited investigation this date is given with reservation. The excavation ceased and a proposal for the expropriation of the plot was made. On the small rocky peninsula on which the meteorological observatory is situated a rescue excavation was conducted which brought to light significant PR settlement remains and a section of a monumental rectangular building of the historical period. (ADelt 692)</page><page sequence="114">114 DAVID BLACKMAN The PR remains were uncovered in three trenches (A,B,F) which were cut in the central and N part of the peninsula. The excavation went down to the natural rock, a depth of 2-3m. Four consecutive architectural phases were identified and, based on the pottery found, are dated to the end of the N and the beginning of the EBA, representing the earliest known set- tlement in Myrina. The earliest phase, phase I, situated on the natural rock, yielded sections of two straight walls 0.3m high, the lower parts of which are still intact. The remains are sealed by a layer of ash. The pottery of this phase presents characteristic shapes of the FN in W Asia Minor (Kum Tepe IB phase), the E Aegean (Emporio VII-VI) and the Cyclades (Grotta-Pelos phase). It consisted of bottle fragments, a pyxis-type vessel and a small jug fragment. In phase II parts of houses with curvilinear plans were uncovered. Above, in phase III, were found parts of rectilinear dwellings as well as two small storage constructions, which have a rectangular and circular plan (with a dividing cross wall), respectively. The pottery found in phases II and III pres- ents typical characteristics of the Black Period of Poliochni; it consists of bottle and small jug fragments. Phase IV has large-scale building remains: a section of a rectangular megaron-type building with a stone-paved outer chamber (I. 5.5m, w. 5.15m) and remains of a rectangular room with a monolithic threshold and tile-paved floor. This phase is dated to the A Blue Period on the basis of the pottery, which consists of fruit bowls, a fragment of a one-handled small cup and a jug fragment. Of the remaining PR movable finds note- worthy are the clay anchor-shaped objects, clay loom-weights, clay pottery fragments, stone and bone tools. In the SE section of the peninsula the remains of a mon- umental rectangular building were uncovered (12.5 x 10.5m), probably belonging to a temple of the historical period. These include the W and large sections of its longitudinal sides. The E part of the building is situated outside the borders of the plot and probably extends to the adjoining Officers' Club plot. The only intact part of the building is the lowest course of the foundation (w. 1.12m) which comprises two rows of rectangular blocks on the sides. The blocks are roughly dressed on the sides and are joined with axe-shaped clamps. The easternmost section of the longitudinal walls at a dis- tance of 4.6m shows a disturbance and subsequent rebuild- ing: clearly the blocks have been moved, the thickness of the foundation is greater (1.62m) and lime mortar has been used as a binding material. The chronology of the building cannot yet be established with certainty since a small trench cut into its interior shows that the fill has been disturbed. However, a possible A dating has been considered on account of the type of clamps used and also the presence of A pottery in the disturbed fill. Because of its monumental construction the structure must have been a temple; according to Friedrich the votive relief, the C honorary inscriptions and perhaps also the clay A kitharodoi figurines in Lemnos Museum have all come from this same site. Further investigation of the area will bring to light signif- icant facts concerning the history of Myrina. (ADelt 692-3) Poliochni.

(ADelt 854) Arisba archaeological site. During the digging of a 2km trench for the laying of drains, excavation machinery destroyed A polygonal walls and a section of the HL cemetery situated on the plot. Legal action taken by the Archaeological Service could not restore the damage, and the rescue excavation which fol- lowed was not completed since limited funding by the munici- pality of Kallonis was only enough to cover 26 squares (5 x 5m). The destruction of the remains was apparently extensive. The investigation, which reached a depth of 1. lm, yielded three bases (1.55 x 1.55m, 2.52 x 1.62m, 2.02 x 0.52m) and a stepped base (3.08 x 1.46m). The bases were constructed with the typi- cal emplekton method and rectangular blocks on the faces. Also uncovered to a depth of 0.4m were a semi-ruined stepped struc- ture (h. 2.2m), a base (4.75 x 4m) and a clay pipe (I. 0.62m, di. 0.135m) oriented NE-SW. The pipe, which was semi-ruined by excavation machinery, was situated almost parallel to the base. An unidentifiable structure also came to light (3.1 x 1.6m) com- prising two spaces enclosed by walls (w. 0.5m) built of small asymmetrical stones and earth. Near the bases two half-ruined sarcophagi were found without bones or grave offerings. In the fill of the remains were found unpainted sherds, ER tile frag- ments, rg closed vessel sherds, a few EBA sherds, figurine frag- ments, six unpainted lamps and bronze coins. The order and type of the bases, along with their relation to the sarcophagi and the location of the site, support the idea that the remains comprise a section of the official cemetery of the anc. town of Arisba, which includes a section of the main road of the necropolis surrounded by the bases. Continued investigation in deeper stratification levels uncovered three A tombs: a simple, pit grave situated under the foundation of wall 6, a cist grave built of asymmetrical, worked stones and an enchytrismos in a pithos. All the graves contained offerings which included: grey Lesbian vessels (buc- chero), an oinochoe, cups without handles, two feeding bottles, an open pot-shaped vessel and a bronze pin. Underneath the tombs, at a depth of 2.2m, the investigation uncovered a stratified level belonging to the EBA. However, due to limited financing the investigation did not continue along the entire length of the trench. (ADelt 690) Aspropotamos Mantamadou (E. Coast).

In the Hatzinikolaou plot, investigation con- tinued on the border of the plot for another five days in 1995 since most of the work had already been completed in 1994 (AR 1999-2000, 112). The excavation uncovered a pit and a stone-built well which were later used to contain redeposited bones, as well as serving as apothetai for the cemetery. In the fill of the remains were found bones, a bronze coin, sections of links, iron nails, cremation ashes, unpainted sherds, frag- ments of glazed pottery from Mytilene workshops, sections of slabs belonging to cist tombs, fragments of plaster, tiles, etc. Near the pit a built cist tomb was found, oriented E-W, with grave offerings consisting of a Lesbian billon coin, a pelikiske and a leaden weight. (ADelt 690) The sanctuary of Meso. With the financial support of TAIIA, the temple was cleared of aquatic plants, debris and earth before starting drainage works. During the investigation, a wall built of unworked stone was uncovered N of the plat- form (1. 6.49m, w. 0.45m); a section of the platform was also unearthed (I. 3.6m, w. 3m). In the course of the cleaning oper- ation, coins dating to the 2nd and 3rd Cts BC were found in the fill of the remains. (ADelt 690) Mytilene. N Harbour (Epano Skala). The NW breakwater was surveyed by A. Simossi (EMA): it is built with facings of worked limestone blocks and fill (I. 76m, visible w. 7m); the SE breakwater is ca 360m long. Underwater inspection outside the anc. S harbour before construction of a new breakwater found no antiquities. There is some evidence of a wreck in deep water (in 1970 the hand of a bronze statue, over life-sized, was found at a depth of 120m by fishermen). (ADelt 843) On the occasion of the opening of the new Mytilene Museum in 1995, the Lesbos-Makaria exhibition was inaugu- rated. This temporary exhibition offers information on the architectural history of Lesbos in antiquity, such as the profes- sions which were practised, the pottery workshops, the quarries in which unfinished sculptures were found, the cultivation of land as depicted in inscriptions, commercial relations through the circulation of coins and transport amphoras, the mints, the flora as depicted on inscriptions and the pottery made at local workshops. (ADelt 685) 8th Demotiko Scholeio (ADelt 49, 643). With limited financing from the Municipality, the Ephorate cleared the debris accumulated by excavation machinery, modem embank- ments and cement. During the 15-day investigation the contin- uation of wall 1 was uncovered (I. 2.57m, w. 1.05m, h. 0.34m) as well as a stone-built structure made of unworked stones (0.72m x 1.7m). In the fill of the structure were found unpaint- ed sherds, a female figurine head, bg and rg sherds. The exca- vation continues. Agia Photini. During the cutting of trial trenches on Odos Kanelli, (G. Kakamboura property) a deep deposit was found which contained a wealth of pottery. Following the systematic investigation of the entire property, and given that no architec- tural remains were found, it was identified as an apothetes. Three clay pipes were uncovered at a depth of 1.76m (oriented N-S and E-W, di. 0.22m). One of the pipes led to a clay-lined well. The most significant finds included a large bi-conical domestic vessel (0.74m high), HL bg pottery, a two-handled bg cup, an inkpot-type scent bottle with two leaf-shaped handles and a bg kantharos. In the course of trial trench cutting on Odos Komninaki 31 (I. Iakovou plot), where pottery workshops were recently found (ADelt 47, 526), R architectural remains were uncovered (30 x 1.8m) with successive floors made of unworked stones. Noteworthy are the piles used to support the foundations since the structure rests on sandy, wet soil. A stone-built well was also uncovered (inner di. 0.7m). During the investigation which reached a depth of 2.54m, it was verified that the well was used until the 2nd Ct, at which time it went out of use and was sealed. It is interesting to note that at a depth of 2.25m the well is strengthened by a wooden beam structure, 0.95m in length. Epano Skala. After the consolidation of the sloping ground during construction work in Odos Agioreitou Panselina (P. Arapi plot), the investigation which began in 1994 could continue (ADelt 49, 526). Two Ott free burials were found at a depth of im without grave offerings. The S end of wall 2 and its junction with wall 1 were uncovered, both to a length of 2m; the walls are built of regular-sized rectangular blocks. On Odos Dionysiou (S. Kefala plot) during foundation work for the construction of a house, at a depth of 7m archi- tectural remains and a section of floor were uncovered. The largest wall is 2.6m long and its floor has traces of mortar. Unfortunately, it was not possible to investigate these architec- tural remains, which continue under the neighbouring houses and road. In Epano Skala, Kalamari District an earlier excavation had revealed a section of the C cemetery of the anc. town. Trenching carried out for the extension of the EIIOM factory uncovered the remains of a funerary peribolos consisting of walls built according to the emplekton technique, with semi- worked and asymmetrical stones (ADelt 29, 507-9). The walls are situated on ground level (I. 13.7m, w. 0.2m-0.3m, h. 0.6m). The few sherds found in the fill of the remains comprised closed vessel and clay pipe fragments. (ADelt 688-90) Niselia Pamphilon. By the church of Ag. Nikolaos, remains of ECh and Byz periods have been found. Remains of anc. columns have been reported in the sea nearby. On the off- shore island of Pamphiloi flint tools, HL architectural remains and reused building materials have been reported. (ADelt 847) At Pegadakia submerged remains were found, possibly an extension of the site known at Kato Tritos (3rd Ct BC-3rd Ct AD). (ADelt 844) Skala Neon Kydonion. A small harbour in the N part of the territory of Mytilene, it served as an anc. port for commu- nications with the mainland opposite and islands between.

At Divolo anc. graves had been excavated (ADelt 20, 490). (ADelt 845) Taxiarches. Cave of Agios Bartholomaios (9km SW of Mytilene). The cave is 190m below the summit of the hill bear- ing the chapel of the same name; it was known to Charitonides and Kondis. The threat of accidents in the dangerous cave, and of illicit excavation, led to excavation by the EPS and the 20th EPCA (I. Efstathiou and P. Avgerinou), started in 1993 (AR 1998-99, 99), continued in 1994 and completed in 1995. A sin- gle archaeological horizon was found, with much LN pottery, a stone figurine of a naked female, bone and stone tools and a few animal bones. No occupation floors were located because there had been many slippages, leaving no clear stratigraphy, but the finds were uniformly LN. The white-on-black painted pottery and the polished decoration are widespread in the Aegean. The site has the character of sporadic rather than per- manent settlement.

Andros, uncov- ered anc. remains. Dry stone walls divide the property into four sections. The plot has a sharp N-S slope and is terraced. There is also dense vegetation in the E half of the property Excavation work was conducted mainly in three sectors (SW, SE and NW) in which 29 trenches were cut. The NE sec- tor, which contains the densest vegetation, was not excavated although there are visible ancient analemma walls there (main- ly in the NW corer). The entire length of its E border is iden- tified with a section of the E wall of the acropolis. In the NW sector a large wall was uncovered (oriented N-S) with a length of 6m and built of stone blocks (due to undergrowth it was not possible to document its width). E of this wall a Il-shaped building (building A) was uncovered (trenches I-III/95). Its N wall extends 4.2m E of the E wall, at a right angle to another wall oriented N-S which was uncov- ered for a length of 2m with a width of 0.45m. Pottery found here includes bg pottery sherds, the foot of a sharp-based amphora and a pyramid-shaped loom-weight. Another structure (building B) was found in the SW sector of the plot (6 x 4.5m) (trench V/95). The walls, built of very large stones, have reinforced comers and small stones are placed between the large stones. Here, a small quantity of pot- tery was found. In addition, a small investigation trench was cut along the length of the S wall, within the building. A few bg pottery sherds were found, as well as the base of a small vessel in situ on the floor of the building. The N wall has suf- fered a slight shifting and slants southwards. Two metres away, S of the building, a wall was found (w. 0.5m) built in a differ- ent manner, with small stones and oriented E-W. In trench XV a wall was uncovered, oriented N-S, 1.7m in length and at a right angle to another wall 2m long. The second wall is at a right angle to the cut natural rock. The walls are built of small stones and are 0.5m wide. A quantity of unpaint- ed coarse-ware pottery was found as well as cover-tile frag- ments. The E wall survives to a height of 0.4m. In trench VI/95 and at a depth of 0.95m a poorly-preserved wall was uncov- ered, oriented N-S. The fact that the two main structures (buildings A and B) are built of very large stones indicates that these were probably used for fortification purposes. It should be noted that the town centre was situated farther S, outside the acropolis and close to the coastline. It appears that the sparsely populated acropolis was used to gather the population together in times of crisis, e.g. the siege of Themistokles after the Persian Wars, or that of Alcibiades during the Peloponnesian War. Within the acropolis were fortification constructions, cisterns and other public buildings. (ADelt 695-6) At Tourlos on the I. Komis plot, near the cemetery of anc. Andros, there exists a small old rural building which is con- structed almost entirely of anc. architectural or other building materials. During restoration work on the building, 22 marble antiquities were detached and transferred to the Archaeological Collection of Palaeopolis. These consisted mainly of architec- tural members and fragments of one or two funerary monu- ments, as shown by fragments of relief simas with anthemia and lion-head decorations. A sarcophagus on the A. Koulouris plot, used in mod. times as a watering-place for animals, was given to the Archaeological Collection of Palaeopolis by the owner. The rectangular sarcophagus is made of reddish volcanic materi- al. It was uncovered in situ within a tomb whose three walls (N, S and E) survive to a considerable height, as does the ochre wall plaster which covers them. There is a rectangular niche in the wall. The sarcophagus (I. 2.2m, w. 0.81m, h. 0.73m) was situated very close to the E wall on small schist slabs. It is decorated with garland reliefs which have a sim- ple round design in the centre; on the longer sides the gar- lands begin at the two edges of an altar and join at the cor- ners where there is a ram's head. The relief is simple and shallow, becoming flat at the altars. This, along with the fact that the stone is porous and relatively roughly-worked, sug- gests that it was perhaps covered with plaster and decorated with painting. In the space between the sarcophagus and the E wall a R lamp was found. W of the tomb, at a distance of only 10m, about two-thirds of its gabled cover was uncov- ered. On the entire plot there are many fragments of similar sarcophagi, most of which are built into dry-stone walls, confirming the existence here of a sector of the town's ceme- tery. (ADelt 696) Following information from a private individual the EMA located and planned in 1998 a wreck with stone sarcophagi of the R period. (Epyov YnH0 2, 152) Work continued in 1999. Delos Geophysical survey was carried out by Dr A. Sarris in collab- oration with the French School (Dr R. Etienne), at the archae- ological site of Delos in September 2000. Its aim was to map important archaeological remains in the area of the Agora of the Italians, and thus indicate a potentially suitable location for excavation in 2001. The survey involved magnetic measure- ments, resistivity and ground penetrating radar. The results of all three methods have indicated the possible presence of underground archaeological remains (which could be architec- tural remains, hearths, furnaces, pottery deposits, etc.), partic- ularly in the SW area of the site. The processing of the meas- urements will be completed within the next few months. The lack of more recent interventions at the archaeological site of Delos has proved particularly useful for the recording of the results. Heraion. H. Sarian (French School) undertook a study and cleaning season with a view to a new publication of the monu- ment and its votive offerings (Fig. 164). This study led to a questioning of the classification of many categories of ceram- ic and terracotta finds and architectural fragments, and of the dating of objects and the monument itself. The identification of fragments of LG pottery (750-700 BC) and of rf Attic pottery later than was previously thought, that is post-480 BC, has implications for the dating of the beginning and end of the sanctuary. Further excavation is planned in 2001. Christian Le Roy (French School) carried out two short study periods, preparing the publication of the House of the Stuccos. The catalogue of plaster fragments was checked and completed; N. Sigalos completed the drawings of plaster frag- ments, profiles and sections, 70 in all; Ph. Collet took ca 100 photographs which still have to be checked on Delos against the fragments. Less than half the conservation work planned was carried out. The removal of samples of plaster for analysis had also to be postponed. As part of the programme of research on the development of the sanctuary of Apollo, R. Etienne and M. Wurch-Kozelj (French School) tried to identify all the sections of the peribo- los wall recorded by previous excavators (the Vallois archive includes a file noting 17 walls or parts of walls attributed to the peribolos of the sanctuary). Cleaning and recording was done on the stretch of wall between the propylaia and the pry- taneion. These walls acted also as terrace walls when the ground falls away to E and W.</page><page sequence="117">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 117 EOOLE FRiANCASEO DATHEI-_S DELOS : IH_RAIO ' '.e'e .-,a1',:,e: q S~aL:r, PRol v et I!,,lilan: Irg. e.

Delos: Heraion They also studied the propylaia in order to evaluate the restoration of the monument in the A period by G. Gruben ('Naxos und Delos', Jahrbuch 112 [1997], 261-416). They redrew a precise plan of the building (Fig. 165) and began to draw all the blocks belonging to each period. The work will be continued in 2001. The restoration is important because the propylaia of Delos are the first example of a monumental entrance way to a sanctuary rather than a simple passageway like that at Yria on Naxos. Proposals were drawn up for test trenches to be made in 2001 in the area of both these monu- ments in order to clarify the stratigraphy. B. Bourgeois and Ph. Jockey (French School) undertook a study season on the polychromy on the marble statues of Delos, and the painting techniques employed. They were great- ly helped by two factors: the use of digital photography which supplied the multiple photographs needed to register the remains of paint accurately and immediate access to the colour prints; and the acquisition of a portable computer which was fast and powerful, and two hard discs equipped with an abun- dant data storage capacity. They studied nineteen marble stat- ues and the same number of terracottas for comparison. The colour appears to have been painted most often on a white ground, and gilding, a frequent feature, was executed by apply- ing gold leaf onto a yellow ground, itself applied on a white ground. Favourite colours were pink, red, blue and mauve, whereas green was rare. The painting was relatively elaborate even on small pieces often of indifferent quality. Delicate bands of different colours decorated the hem of tunics and cloaks, necklaces of gold adorned the necks of Aphrodites. On the terracottas the polychromy was better preserved and thus the study of these revealed a much more extensive palette and the use of subtler techniques than previously appre- ciated. The modelling was brought to life by the play of light and shade, and the realism of the statue was accentuated. Numerous pieces both of marble and of terracotta revealed traces of re-painting and re-gilding in antiquity. Sanctuary of Apollo. A. Famoux (French School) reports: 'As part of the programme 'Water on Delos' we undertook the study of the circulation and storage of water in the sanctu- ary of Apollo. We concentrated on the S sector of the sanctu- ary, S of the Prytaneion (Fig. 166). We excavated the whole of the main E/W drain from the E edge of the peribolos wall to the N comer of the S portico (GD 4). We cleaned the top of the small walls which lined the drain and cut test trenches across it at three places, as well as trench- es outside the drain. They revealed that it collected water from S, N and E, and that at the E end there was a bend which joins it to a long N/S drain running alongside the Monument of the Bulls, and passes under the S side of the peribolos wall. The drain is constructed in exactly the same way as the drains in the 166. Delos: sanctuary of Apollo  .-.-. . · TL-l C 1 ·-s c F- F L II I I tl I i.. ·--- --·- I;T-- (, 165.

The low walls to the N and S rest in granite slots or are built on blocks of granite or gneiss. They consist of regular courses of slabs of gneiss or granite resting on a first course of granite blocks. The bottom is evenly paved with slabs of gneiss set in on both sides under the low walls. It was covered for most of its length by large slabs of gneiss. We excavated the two lateral drains to the S which came from the direction of the agora of the Delians and the one from the N running from the prytaneion. These had been built with less care especially the western of the S drains, and the N drain. These were made of slabs of gneiss placed on edge or of gran- ite rubble surmounted by a single course of small slabs of gneiss. Their depth was 0.30-0.50m and their width 0.25-0.40m. We also discovered a fourth branch added later (reused blocks including a block of poros), at the E end of the main drain level with the L-shaped drain. The junction between the E/W drain and the N/S drain is remarkable. There was a jig in the W wall and another in the E wall and a difference in level between the two drains was made up by the superimposition of two foundation slabs. This ensured that the drain served only for the drainage of water from the sanctuary. Another drain, traceable from its cover slabs, which runs along the E side of the peribolos wall towards the S road, is not connected to this system. The earth found on the paving slabs of the main drain appeared not to have been disturbed by previous excavations. It was rich in organic material and samples were taken. Finds in the layer above the slabs and in the foundation trench and ditches which seemed to be contemporary with the drainage system (Athenian coinage of the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC, frag- ments of Megarian bowls with a signature and amphora stamps of Cnidus) indicated that this drainage work on the sanctuary plain was carried out after 166 BC. This is significant as the drain passed under the propylaea of the sanctuary (GD 5), reconstructed by the Athenians towards the middle of the 2nd Ct BC. We concluded from the resemblance of the main drain to the drains of the town, and from the solidity of its construction, that the area between the prytaneion to the N and the agora of the Delians to the S might have served as a square or thor- oughfare especially in view of the bases to the S and N; on the W side the 'votive pylon' to the S on the E edge of the road that leads to the sanctuary; and on the E side the 'pylon of Pythion' restored by Vallois on a poros base skirted by the drain. An E/W thoroughfare here would lengthen the road to the W which separates the portico of the Naxians and the portico of Philip. Finally we excavated the area SW of the G well noted by Gallet de Santerre in 1948 and then dated to the G period, but never published. This revealed arrangements in the granite possibly connected to the well. The earth contained mostly material of the LHL period (a coin, fragments of unguentaria and bowls with relief design), suggesting that the area was reorganized at that time. This is surprising since the excavator said clearly that the well had contained only G and A material. This suggests that further excavation of the area round the well to study the relationship between it and the lower terrace wall is desirable.' As part of the same programme ('Water on Delos') Michele Brunet and a team of French archaeologists and geog- raphers carried out a season of survey, cleaning and limited excavation at the site of the sacred lake and other areas signif- icant for this study. They found that the lake was formed by seepage of ground water augmented by water collected in a vast depression in the granite substratum at this place. There was no connection between the lake and the Inopos. To the W of the lake, the structure known as the 'early quay' (quai primitif' Fig. 167, from the S) seemed to be rather a retaining wall holding back a bank of earth stretching from the foot of the Terrace of the Lions towards the lake. This was built earlier than the lake's enclosure wall and the Agora of the Italians, and possibly con- temporary with the building of the Terrace of the Lions. The enclosure wall surrounding the lake (built at the time of independence) was elliptical in shape, and preserved to a height of 1.90m. It seemed to have undergone several building phases. Its inner face up to a certain height was covered by car- bonate concretions which have also been found on cisterns on 168. Delos: drain</page><page sequence="119">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 119 Delos when the water has lapped against the stone. In the NE section of the wall an opening in the surface originally used as an overflow (Fig. 168) was connected on its lower side to a drain flowing in a N direction towards the bay of Skardana; it later became a conduit bringing water from the N into the lake. In the walls and cisterns, systematic measurements were taken of the water table and the depth of the water and it was found that these often had a mixed supply system, making the distinction between categories difficult. The team also con- firmed the present paucity of water resources on the island (all the figures recorded were below sea level). The year 2000 was particularly dry but they concluded that the climatic conditions were much the same as in antiquity. The different 'talwegs' of the island and particularly that of the Inopos showed no sign of silting up, at least in the Holocene. The team therefore concluded that the Inopos was never more than an intermittent water course with a very feeble flow of water. Its headwaters lie on the S slope of Cynthos where streams converge to meet in a large cavity. A seasonal lake forms there and flows northwards down a gorge. Here were the upper and lower reservoirs, built to help with the storage of water from the streams. Their reciprocal function was not explained. The team followed the course of the water downstream from the lower reservoir, and noted that it made an L-shaped bend to reach the coast in the area of the Agora of the Competaliasts. Analysis of the topography confirmed by a stereoscopic examination of aerial photographs and by map- ping the surface of the ground water of the rocky substratum showed that there was no connection between the lower course of the Inopos and the lake, thus disproving the hypothesis of L. Cayeux. Although the profile of the beaches and the depth of sub- merged beach rock and structural remains suggest that the sea level in antiquity was 1.5-2.5m lower, they concluded that this difference did not indicate that there had been a major dis- placement of the coastline nor that this had occurred every- where. For example, at the mouth of the Inopos there must have been a deep indentation, now silted up, corresponding to the Sacred Port which was also better protected from the pre- vailing winds by the foundations of a large mole of natural granite half-completed, but which reached sea level when the sea level was lower. They conclude that as a result of global warming and the melting of the polar ice-caps the rise in sea level is likely to become more marked. The consequences are already visible on the archaeological remains with the formation of marshland on the W edge of the sanctuary, especially the agora of Theophrastos where many anc. blocks are stored. They suggest that a new solution to the storage of these blocks and the path- ways through the site needs urgently to be found. SW foundation of the sanctuary. Ch. Picard and J. Replat ('Recherches sur la topographie du Hieron delien,' BCH 48 [1924] 217-63) had suggested that the Colossus of the Naxians found near the oikos of the Naxians was not in its original posi- tion, because there were no foundations for it, though it weighed over 35 tons, and because according to Plutarch (Nicias 3) it was destroyed by the fall of the palm of Nicias, adjacent to the stoa of the Naxians. They concluded that its original setting was probably the large foundation to the E of the stoa. Fr. Prost of the French School undertook a thorough cleaning of the area around this foundation in order to verify this theory by scientific means. (R. Vallois, Architecture hel- lenique et hellenistique de Delos [1944] 21nn.2-3; P. Courbin, 'Le colosse naxien et le palmier de Nicias' Suppl. BCH 1 [1973] 165) Four test trenches were dug to the N, S and E of this large foundation. Dating evidence was provided by 2nd- st Ct BC sherds found between its blocks, and a stamped amphora han- dle from Cnidus (EYPYKPATOY). From this fixed point it was possible to work out the relative chronology of the whole area, much disturbed by successive arrangements of paving and monument bases. The large foundation was found to be later than all the pavements and the bases that surrounded it, being superimposed on them to the N and NE. A study season was conducted by H. Siard in collaboration with Fr. Muller (French School) on the Sarapieion. C. Muller continued the task of drawing up plans of the sanctuary and studied blocks belonging to a Doric portico possibly located on the terrace to the E of the dromos. Siard located papers by R. Vallois on the temple of Sarapis (temple F) and compared their contents with present observations. Corrected photographs were taken of the preserved walls of Sarapieion C to help with drawing sections. More work was done on preparing descrip- tions of the architecture of the monument, noting where possi- ble the relationship between remains and inscriptions, and fur- ther study was undertaken on the relationship with surrounding monuments to clarify the chronology and pin-point the areas needing further excavation. Two study periods on the theatre and its surroundings were carried out by J.-C. Moretti (French School). The inven- tory of the main blocks of the koilon found scattered to the W and S of the theatre was completed. A special study was made of the stones with picked decoration (Fig. 169), the coping stones (Fig. 170) and the stones with bosses bearing letters (Fig. 171). A. Badie checked all the existing plans of houses N of the theatre and drew up a 1/100 plan of the hostelry (GD 113) and of the sanctuaries of the theatre (GD 16) (Fig. 172, from the NE). The temple identified as the sanctuary of Dionysos, Hermes and Pan (GD 116c) is apparently aligned on the centre of the orchestra or, more exactly, on the point of virtual inter- section of the facings of the rear support walls of the koilon (Fig. 173, from the SW). Melos E. Photos-Jones (BSA) reports on the Agia Kyriaki 2000 study season: 'The aim of the week-long study season was to conduct field sampling of the sediments and pottery at Agia Kyriaki in order to obtain themoluminescence (TL) dates for pottery and to establish the suitability of these sediments for dating, using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL). If this technique proved successful at Agia Kyriaki, then the sedimentary layers which contain in situ pottery at other sites might themselves be dated independently, in addition to dates provided from pottery (TL) or organic remains (C14). For the technique to operate effectively, the background dose rate of gamma radiation must be established over a given time period at each sample location by the insertion of a radiation scintillator into the section face. This was done at each sample location and readings were taken over periods of 3 and 10 minutes using a Bichron portable gamma ray spectrometer. Samples of the sediment were taken for laboratory analysis by inserting a copper tube into the face, and light-sealing each end on removal. When the samples were returned to the UK, the OSL signal of the sediment was assessed by analysing the quartz fraction using a single aliquot regenerative technique to establish the date of burial of the sed- iment. This work is ongoing, as is the use of the felspar frac- tion in the sediment to provide a back-up age. Such age deter- minations depend on the sediment remaining unaltered by heat or light since burial and so delivering an unambiguous signal.</page><page sequence="120">120 DAVID BLACKMAN Delos, theatre: 169. Decorated stone 170. Coping stone 172, 173. Delos: theatre and sanctuaries Preliminary results indicate that the choice of site is crit- ical and that at sites like Agia Kyriaki, there exists the dan- ger that the OSL signal may have been reset by geothermal activity, thus yielding anomalous ages. Sites outwith the immediate geothermal areas of Melos may thus offer the best potential for OSL dating of sediments. To that end we intend to apply for a permit to sample pottery and sediments from other sites like Kato Komia, Soleta/Amydgales and Tria Pigadia, where the effect of the geothermal activity is less obvious. 171.

The largest and clearly the oldest of them all is the quarry at the Ktema tou Vlachou site, situated W of the well- known Myc tombs investigated in the 19th Ct by the Ephor Stavropoulos. Most of the limestone quarrying was conducted in this area. A fourth quarry, farther W in the area near the central plateau of Apolloneio, produces a coarse-grained marble with black veins.

The small gold animal figure, probably a goat, found in a clay lamax in the SW ofXeste 3 and reported last year (AR 1999-2000, 122 &amp; fig. 179) is shown in the cover illustration. In 2000, excavation was confined to points where columns for the new roofing of the excavations were to be located. These shafts (3 x 4m) reached bedrock at a depth of 15-20m. Antiquities and even structures were naturally located in vari- ous places, which necessitated the relocation of some of the columns. It was clear from the 35 shafts dug in the area, that Akrotiri sustained successive destructions due to earthquakes, followed by rebuilding of houses on the levelled remains of the ruins, re-using building material from the earlier structures. In the ECyc layer were discovered rock-cut chambers, filled with deposits of this period, and originally used as tombs, but later, with the expansion of the settlement, re-used as storage areas. Seismic destructions and rebuilding are also confirmed for 174. Thera, Akroteri: fragment of wall painting f : the MCyc period. A major element of these levels is pottery decorated with geometric designs, human figures, animals, birds and fish. Imports from other Cyc islands and further afield are evidence of trading contacts in this period. During the LCyc period, the inhabitants rebuilt their hous- es after each earthquake and destruction, on top of the levelled remains of the earlier buildings, and decorated their buildings with wall-paintings which have been preserved in fragments, one showing a boar's tusk helmet (Fig. 174). A pair of wood- en hands and a number of stone objects may be singled out amongst the finds. In one of the shafts, beds with their straw mattresses were found (Fig. 175); in another, a group of bas- kets together, and in a third, a sack of barley. These car- bonized pieces of furniture, equipment and food indicate that the explosion of the volcano did not allow the inhabitants of Akrotiri to take basic foodstuffs and necessities with them in their flight. (Ergon 2000, 88-95) Further reports are provided on excavations of the LR cemetery on the Karamolengos plot. These consist of fine funerary monuments built on top of earlier pit graves.

The kore, dating to ca 640 BC, wears a narrow diadem, and is clothed in a traditional long peplos with a belt tied at the waist. While the tenon which joined the statue to the base is intact, the base itself has not been located. The statue is in the Daedalic style, which is highly formalized and bears eastern / m influences, and immediately precedes the early A : ' J period when the korai and kouroi (youths) were perfected. The director of the excavation, Haralambos / Sigalas, believes that the statue was toppled while being erected, or shortly thereafter, because the final details had not been completed, including the smoothing of the marble's surface. Furthermore, the only damage is to part of the right arm and the nose, which is just missing its tip. Otherwise it is in exceptional condition and must be ranked as one of the most important finds in Greece in many years.

On the Kavoura plot (AR 1997-98, 109) two vaulted tombs were found, the first in Kos, with the vaults of tile partly preserved (Fig. 177); both con- tained many burials. Two inscriptions of the R period were found; another (re-used) referring to the (hitherto unattested) cult of Hestia Famia (2nd-1st Ct BC); and two epitaphs of women from Antioch. On the Ploumi-Vallianatou plot (AR 1999-2000, 124) a second season completed the excavation, with a total of 210 tombs and seven tomb structures (Fig. 178). Continued use of the same area and the same tombs, and tomb robbing in antiq- uity, made it difficult to distinguish the burials and their goods. Six types of burial were recognized: notably rectangular cist graves with stone walls and covers (70) and tile graves (59); also seven twin cist graves. There were 23 simple pit graves with tile or clay covers, 11 rectangular cist graves with tile or clay walls and covers, only 6 enchytrismoi and 6 sarcophagus burials and 5 open burials. The burials are HL (predominant) and R. HL grave goods were mainly unguentaria, olpai, two- handled phialai and alabastra; R grave goods were mainly glass unguentaria and lamps. One burial seems to be of A date, and other A sherds were found. The seven tomb structures were of R-LR date, badly disturbed already in antiquity; a group of seven inscribed funerary stelae was found in the centre of one structure, accompanied by clay pipes set vertically in the ground to receive libations.

During roadworks on the Kardamaina- Antimacheia road six burial pits were discovered (three well- preserved) with primary cremations of the G period: the type is known as 'con quatro pozzetti' (Fig. 179). The pits contained a thick burnt layer, very few traces of bones (probably because of the intense fire) and a large amount of pottery of various forms - local pottery of the early decades of LGI (mid-8th Ct). This confirms again the tradition of adult cremation in Kos in G times (not contracted burial, as Morricone argued). (ADelt 807) Psalidi. In the area known as 'Herakles' excavation of the A-C sanctuary and earlier PR remains continued; in 1998 the narrow (W) side of the A temple was defined; its dimensions were 9 x 24m. In 1999 work was concentrated between the temple and the great wall to the S (also of the A period and vis- ible for 32m). A level was found with intense traces of burning, containing a large number of figurines (horses and bovines) and linked to remains of buildings of the same period; we are dealing with earlier (G) ritual usage.

In the W part of the mod. town the uncovering of part of an anc. house was nearly completed and near the S wall line remains of another important house started to be revealed - one of a number of HL houses around the building of the great Gymnasion-Ptolemaion, remains of which have gradually been discovered in recent decades. In 1999 remains of another important house were found near a crossroads in the S part of the anc. city; it has a larger and a smaller andron, with plastered walls with polychrome painted and plastic decoration; mud brick was used in the upper part of the walls. To the NW work continued on the Asklepieion in 1998-99; inscribed bases were found with artists' signatures, including that of Pythokritos, son of Timochares, and part of the founda- tions of a monumental building probably with a stoa. In the E part of the anc. city remains of a 4th-Ct BC glass works were excavated, the earliest known in the anc. Greek world. In the SE cemetery, W of the Korakonero archaeological site, part of a tomb complex was excavated with burials and interesting epigraphic finds; nearby another funerary monu- ment is being excavated. In the W cemetery, on Kamirou, a rectangular rock-cut pit was clearly used for primary cremation burials. Work by the water company AEYAP in the E cemetery, on Kallitheas, revealed three poros sarcophagoi with rich 4th- Ct grave goods including a silver phiale.

A major conclusion from two years of excavation, is that the destruction of the palatial building was due to an earthquake and a fire, during which the temperature reached 1000° C; this explains the vitrification of ceramics. On the ground floor of room 32, were eleven pithoi and 87 smaller vessels of different shapes - amphoras and buck- ets. All were carefully arranged and most were empty. Some amphoras would have been filled with liquids. Also found were five decorated LM IB baggy alabastra, two bronze vessels and a lump of lead, deformed due to the fire; 27 pithoi and 109 small- er vessels were found in room 33. The effects of the fire were fiercer here as is clear from the deformation of the vases and their vitrified state. The room was excavated down to floor level only in the W part, especially in the SW comer, where the pithoi were particularly well preserved (Fig. 186). The smaller vessels were mainly small, cylindrical amphoras that, according to the excavators, had contained precious liquids. Half of the amphoras had been full, since the original stoppers were found. An Egyptian faience scarab, found in room 33, indicates trade relations between Archanes and Egypt.

Rethemiotakis (23rd EPCA) reports on the 1997, 1999 and 2000 excavation seasons: 'In the 1997 excavation season work concentrated on the excavation of the old palace period building remains located along the W wing of the later palace. Room 36 was complete- ly explored and revealed many stucco fragments, and quanti- ties of old palace period pottery including carinated cups and tumblers similar to those found in 1996 in other areas of the building. The discovery of terraces beyond the palace to the W excludes the possibility of a W court. In this area building 2 was founded, after the destruction of the palace, in LM IB. It was subsequently destroyed by earthquake within the same ceramic period. A limited re-occupation took place in LM IIIB. Building 2 was well constructed; some blocks were incised with tridents and stars. Fragmentary sandstone horns of conse- cration were found amongst the collapsed building materials; they probably originally belonged to the nearby palace and were used in building 2 as building material. A similar frag- ment had been found in the area of the E wing of the palace. Building 2 had seven rooms and a well-preserved staircase, the lower flight consisting of 12 steps and two landings. One of the two entrances to the building was found blocked. The function of three semi-basement rooms can be ascertained by their mov- able objects and built-in constructions. In the central room a permanent grinding installation was found, consisting of a small bench and three mortars, two of which were incorporat- ed into the construction. Two storage rooms contained seven pithoi. Throughout the ground floor spherical loom-weights testify the existence of a loom on the building's upper floor. Noteworthy amongst the movable finds is a fine stirrup jar dec- orated with floral and marine motifs, a cup-rhyton with olive spray decoration, a cup decorated with papyrus found together with a square serpentine offering table, a few pieces of pumice and a fragmentary bronze rod, possibly part of a staff or a metal axe. All had collapsed from the upper floor and probably were objects related to a shrine. The seismic destruction of building 2 in LM IB is contemporary with the LM IB destruction hori- zon on Crete. Contacts with Knossos are attested even after the destruction of the palace in LM IA. In the 1999 excavation season two more rooms (10 and 11) of building 2 were excavated and found to contain plentiful pottery, mainly conical cups and hemi-spherical cups, which came from a vividly burnt destruction deposit. Two pithoi, one with tripod feet, belong to a local Pediada workshop. A pithos with a brief Linear A inscription found in room 7 belongs to the same workshop. Excavation concentrated on the N wing of the palace and eight rooms were explored; those at the W end were found much destroyed by ploughing. Four parallel terrace walls, incorporating reused ashlar blocks of the N wing's S facade, were associated with two fragmentary crucibles and fragments of potter's wheels. Associated pottery dates the sparse reoccupation of this area to LM IIIA2-B. At the NW corer of the N wing was an MM III foundation deposit con- sisting of 60 vases; traces of burnt organic matter and animal bones, including goat horns, are probably the remains of a ban- quet. A rectangular serpentine offering table was positioned above the foundation deposit. The destruction deposit, caused by earthquake, spread throughout the N wing. Twenty new mason's marks were iden- tified, bringing the total number to 80 from the palace and building 2. Stucco fragments, fallen from the walls, have bands in blue (dark and light), red and purple. Plaster fragments in relief probably derive from window and door frames. Most rooms were empty, but room 44 produced plentiful pottery, which had collapsed from the upper floor, together with schist slabs which formed the paving of the room on the upper floor. Pottery collected from the earthquake destruction deposit dates to mature LM IA, including cups with wavy bands, Vapheio- type cups, hemispherical cups with reverse spiral decoration, floral motifs including reeds, papyrus and crocus. Two sound- ings produced MM IB sherds and thus suggest that the N wing had a stratigraphic sequence similar to that of the W wing; both wings were constructed during MM IIIB/LM IA, unlike the E wing, which produced deep MM IIIA levels and extensive ceramic deposits. There is a strong possibility that the W wing was abandoned earlier, since no pottery of mature LM IA date was found such as that discovered along the N wing. Finally, the destruction of the entire palatial complex dates to the end of LM IA. Limited LM IIIA2-B re-occupation occurred in the area of the N wing. A strong wall located along the N extension of the N wing's W exterior wall proved to belong to a separate building. Two rooms were partly excavat- ed, one containing a Pediada workshop pithos and amongst other finds a clay female figurine and a conical steatite seal- stone were discovered; 150 sherd samples have been send for residue analysis to the Environmental Laboratory of Bristol University. After the 2000 excavation season 650m2 of the N wing have been excavated. Its total extent is calculated as well above 1,000m2, so it is comparable to the N wings of the Malia and Phaistos palaces, where the N wings are almost twice the size of their E and W wings. The size of the Galatas N wing, and also the presence of specific architectural details, signify the importance of this wing in comparison with the E, S and W wings. Monumentality is stressed by the ashlar masonry, with vertical setbacks, used along the S facade of the N wing, which overlooks the central court. The abundant use of vertical, and sometimes double, wooden beams in the rubble construction, supported a heavy weight - a first if not also a second floor. Gypsum, imported from Knossos, is used for doorjambs. Interior walls were covered with painted plaster decorated with bands in dark and light red and dark blue; floors were white- plastered. The stratigraphical and architectural sequence along the N wing proved equally interesting: E of areas 46-47, the building was founded immediately above an MM IB level, which sug- gests that the MM IB settlement extended to this part of the site. The E wing was founded as an independent building in MM IIIA, whereas the final palatial building was founded in MM IIIB, including all wings, the central court and the re- organization of the pre-existing building, now the E wing of the palace. Several doorways in the N wing, and in the E and W wings, had been blocked for structural purposes slightly before the final destruction in mature LM IA. A typical Minoan hall (areas 48b-54) was found equipped with the following: a polythyron consisting of five gypsum doorjamb bases, a porch with grey-green stone column bases and a light-well, the collapsed ashlar blocks of which prove the earthquake destruction of the building; these have been left in situ. At the NW end of the light well, a doorway led to a stair- case, the lower flight equipped with eight stone-built and red- plaster-coated steps. Traces of wall plaster are preserved in situ. The staircase had two upper flights. The room located N of the staircase was apparently paved with wooden slabs, the gaps between which had been filled in with plaster; a similar floor arrangement was found in the Zakros palace 'banquet hall'. Sections of the N wing's 2m-high ashlar E facade, with horizontal setbacks, were traced. Sections of this monumental facade were obscured when large quantities of domestic MM IIIB pottery were thrown away. The deposit also included large quantities of animal bones (bovid, pig, goat) but also sea snails,</page><page sequence="128">128 DAVID BLACKMAN 187. Gortyn: altar to the Supreme God which probably were thrown here during some clean-up of the building before or during the MM IIIB repairs, which coincide chronologically with the so-called first, and very destructive, Thera earthquake. Sections of the area between the N wing and building 2 were reoccupied in LM IIIA2; two small rooms had been built. Contemporary activities were traced along the E side of the LM IB building 2. 31 new mason's marks were recorded (13 stars, 10 tridents, one double cross, 4 etas, 1 incised line, a rectangle), which brings the total catalogued to 109. On one occasion a trident and an eta were carved on the same stone.' Gortyn. Area of the altar to the Supreme God (Oe6; 'YWtVro;S). A. Di Vita (Italian School) reports on the 2000 sea- son: 'The area of study was defined by the results of the last excavations. The complexity and importance of this area was made obvious by the discovery of the stadium and the study of the temple and its surroundings since 1997. The definition of this public space was further facilitated by the discovery of yet another monumental feature, the altar dedicated to the Supreme God, discovered during the 1999 excavations (Fig. 187). These studies, very different from the Italian School's traditional areas of study in Gortyn, inaugurated a new area of research, in which it was necessary to move in stages, in order to establish carefully the archaeology and the urban planning. The study of the temple in previous years made possible the examination of the internal stratigraphy of the building, and particularly the interventions of later antiquity; a study of the backfill in the area directly surrounding the monument fol- lowed. The discovery of the altar during this phase of our work led to changes in our approach: the need was now clear for a systematic exploration of the backfills, which during later antiquity had completely covered the altar. Similar conclusions resulted from the study of the stadium: during the 1999 season its NW comer was identified, as well as the beginning of its N retaining wall, which corresponds with the starting line. This forms the narrow side of the com- plex, which also separates it from the open-air area, where - a little farther away - the above-mentioned altar is located. This intermediate area (between the stadium, the temple and the gymnasium of the praetorium, and possibly defined to the E by a road not yet excavated) was where the open-air worship of the Supreme God took place. It had already been partly studied as far as the Mid Imperial period in the N part - near the tem- ple - and in the SW comer, where a staircase was starting to appear, giving access to a later entrance into the gymnasium of the praetorium. Complete investigation of this public space had priority in our research; also the creation of a passage would enable visi- tors to enjoy and understand the monumental complex uncov- ered, some structures of which were preserved to a consider- able height. Both excavation trenches, therefore, concentrated on the area behind the altar, one in the central sector and the other near the retaining wall. The two interventions (under the supervision of M.A. Rizzo and E. Lippolis respectively) were carried out in close collaboration, to allow the discussion and verification of any problems regarding backfills of the complex stratigraphy, that had accumulated in the area, and which provides a series of important excavation groups for the 4th to 6th-Ct AD phases, useful for reconstructing the material culture of that period. It was thus possible to follow the succession of backfills that covered the whole area. The raising of the interior of the stadium, by ca 1m from track level, dates to an early phase of the 3rd Ct AD; this marks the beginning of the abandonment of the monument. The backfills on the exterior start in the first half of the 4th Ct AD. For these an earth ramp was constructed, which covered the by then deteriorated staircase leading to the secondary entrance of the gymnasium, and created a passage which would later be raised again many times, always with the same characteristics, but with a smaller gradient. The earth- quake of AD 365 was probably what led to a serious collapse of the whole monumental sector, which caused the deposit of mixed debris, both in the interior of the stadium, most of which was backfilled to a height of over 2.50m, and on the exterior, where the ramp, however, was preserved at a higher level. From the 5th Ct AD, on the other hand, the situation outside appears less under control, and a series of deposits of material begins, this time from the NE, which completely cover the pre- vious levels with large masses of soil, almost totally covering the altar. At the end of the 5th/beginning of the 6th Ct AD, the opening of large pit marks a renewed phase of use of the area, this time possibly for the procurement of building material. In this pit, the top part of the collapsed rear wall of the temple was found, precisely as it had fallen, in seven successive layers, thus allowing the reconstruction of the architectural sequence, from the architrave to the geison (the rest of the wall which had collapsed and lay at a higher level had been completely robbed in later antiquity). Later, further levelling operations brought the surface close to present day level, creating - at this level - a passage of trod- den earth, with a small drain at its N edge. Agricultural activi- ty on the surface has erased any other potential evidence of use in the area, which was already becoming completely agricul- tural. Although by the end of the mission it was possible to reconstruct the succession of the phases and to excavate the larger part of the archaeological levels, the study of the square was not completed, due to the complexity of the stratigraphy, and because we believe that the full understanding of the area is important in order to move to an historical interpretation which pays careful attention to the phenomenon of develop- ment of use of urban space in the ancient polis.' Metropolis. A. Di Vita (Italian School) directed the 2000 season. He reports: 'Work was carried out in the SW comer of the basilica, where the Ephorate conservators lifted the mosaic panel bear- ing the inscription of the Patron, Theodorus. The excavation area was 4.55 x 2.80m. Once the mosaic was lifted, a tomb appeared below the mortar bedding, its walls made of slabs (1.34 x 0.68 x 2.80m). The tomb had been</page><page sequence="129">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 129 opened in a layer of compact soil, which covered a wall of N-S direction, and this wall had proba- bly been re-used as the N wall of the burial. 0.75m to the W of this wall, a further small wall runs round it, which could have been the edge of a drain. Both structures date to Imperial times, and were covered by a series of alabaster slabs (possi- bly the base of a drain), which precede the burial. The burial itself probably belongs to a series of tombs which predate the Justinianic basilica. The classification of the finds (ceramic, glass, metal, lithic) from both the 1999 excavation, and the two rescue excavations carried out in 2000, was completed. Although the usual June-July excavation of the basilica area did not take place this year, con- servation of the mosaic from the floor of the cen- tral nave, with the inscription of Bishop Vetranios, made it necessary to study the area below it before it could be re-set. A second intervention took place after removal of an olive tree from between the 4th and 5th aisles from the N. All the sculptures of the basilica were put in order, both those kept in the storerooms and those in situ. A detailed catalogue was made to supply all missing information, with a view to the final publi- cation currently being prepared by Farioli Companati and her team. Finally, the classification of lamps from the Praetorium excavation has begun, particularly those recovered from sector I after 1995.' Gournes (beach of the former US Military Base). An EM I cemetery with 36 rock-cut tombs divided into two sectors was discovered in 1999. Vases of the Pyrgos, Agios Onouphrios and Agios Nikolaos Styles were found. An important find was a silver necklace. Tomb architecture resembles that of Agia Photia Sitias, with obvious Cycladic influences. To the NW a rectangular MM IIB-IIIA building was discovered.

Chatzi-Vallianou (Archaeological Institute of Crete) gives an extensive report on this important LM III site, of which only a summary is provided here. Further work revealed that the Koukouvitsaki plot at Kato Gouves, which includes the 'Potters' District', forms the W edge of the LM III settlement (Fig. 188). Complexes A (15 rooms) and B form one building, which consisted of many rooms set around a large central space. Building complex F, at the N end of the plot, consists of three separate buildings (Fl and F2 to the W, F23 to the E). Each had many rooms arranged around one basic central unit, which had benches and a hearth. F2 seems to be the most important. Between the buildings public outdoor areas and workshop installations were arranged, and a road running S-N towards the sea was identified between Fl and F3, equipped with a drainage system of stone-built and clay-pipe drains. In this area there are at least two cists for the preparation/process- ing of clay, with pebble and plaster floors, and connected through drain outlets to the drainage system mentioned above. Installations for the production of clay vessels and especially pottery were found in all three building complexes (room XI of building A being the most complete); these had pottery kilns, located outside the buildings. Pottery found in complex F dates to LM IIIB. (ADelt 771-8) Kato Symi: A small excavation took place in 2000 under the direction ofA. Lembesi, in order to check the foundations of the supports for the roofing of the ancient remains. The interior face of the N wall of the peribolos of the sanctuary was revealed. More G bronze animal figurines were found in the fill, as well as part of a four-sided bronze support, and part of a stone table of offerings with a Linear A inscription. The fill was a thick layer created as a result of open-air worship: there was an abundance of fragments of cult vessels and domestic vases, cooking-pots, animal bones from sacrifices, a large number of tables made of serpentine, as well as a clay model of a niche, with the feet of a human figurine in it. Of great interest is a gold signet ring: a cult scene with three figures is depicted on the surface, quite unlike any other known. The excavator believes that the owner of the ring had a connection with the adminis- tration of the sanctuary and offered it at the end of his tenure to one of the priestly officials. The excavation of the fill is not complete. The upper level dates to the end of the Postpalatial period. When the fill began has yet to be determined. (Ergon 2000, 102-103) Keratokambos, Viannou.

A 2.50 x 5m test was sunk in order to investigate earlier phases of occupation at the site and where applicable to reach bedrock. The stratigraphy can be summa- rized as follows: (1) R (2nd Ct AD) fill for the Villa Dionysos garden associated with no architectural features; (2) two PG architectural/occupation phases (lower floor 10th Ct BC, upper floor 9th Ct BC) with scant building remains and only a few pottery profiles or small finds, the later phase associat- ed with abandonment; (3) a massive M rubbish fill set direct- ly on bedrock, predominantly LM I but with a few LM IIIA1 sherds. The pottery was very fragmentary with no complete profiles to be restored. No M architectural features were found. Excavation material is in preparation for publication by Professor N. Coldstream (Gr and R pottery), Dr E. Hatzaki (stratigraphy and M pottery), Dr A. Sarpaki (archaeobotanical material) and Valasia Isaakidou (faunal material).' Important site conservation work was conducted at the palace and surrounding buildings in 1999 under the responsi- bility of the 23rd EPCA and TAAIIEAE (Epyov Y7nO 3, 160). A. Karetsou reports that architectural conservation was com- pleted in the following areas of the palace: 'Kouloures' and the old palace period remains to the N, NW Treasury House, S of the west wing magazines (areas 18, 19, 20 in S. Hood, W. Taylor, fig. 1), E of the south propylaeum, south corridor and south entrance (areas 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in Hood, Taylor, fig. 1), area of the old palace period houses and house 117. In the above- mentioned areas ancient walls were conserved and wall foun- dations were cleaned. The Minoan drains, together with those added by Evans and Platon, were exposed and cleaned; these were put into use for the disposal of rain water from the west wing and west court. The LM pithoi of the south propylaeum were conserved together with pottery groups deriving from the conservation of walls. The Regional Funds for Crete provided the necessary funding for the restoration of Evans's Villa Ariadne and its garden. At the Villa Dionysos, the Knossos palace restoration team participated in the necessary conserva- tion of walls and mosaics prior to the construction of shelters, a project supervised by AAAM. In the immediate future an archaeological park is planned for the Little Palace, Villa Ariadne and Villa Dionysos. The creation of a car park is planned in a 18 acre field located N of the palace. (Epyov Yn7O 3, 280-1) Kommos. Joseph and Maria Shaw (ASCS) report on the 25th season (2000): 'This has been another regular study season, as we contin- ue to work towards the publication of the results of some 25 years of excavation of the multi-period site of Kommos. Permission for both study, and for excavation in the past, has been obtained from the Greek Department of Antiquities through the ASCS, and with the academic sponsorship of the University of Toronto, where J.W. Shaw and M.C. Shaw, respectively Director and Assistant Director of the excavation, have been teaching. Since 1995, when excavation was put off deliberately to allow time for publication, our chief concern has been the com- pletion of a series of volumes presenting and interpreting the material remains from the M and Gr levels. Four volumes have already seen the light of publication. Vol. IV, The Greek Sanctuary, was published in two parts in November of 2000. Most of the study this year focused on vol. V, which con- centrates on the large and important civic buildings of the M period. J.W. Shaw is completing his study of the architecture. Aleydis Van de Moortel (ASCS) and Jeremy Rutter (Dartmouth College) have been, respectively, studying the Proto- and Neo-/Postpalatial pottery including imports (from the Greek Mainland, the Aegean islands, Cyprus, Syro- Palestine, Egypt, Sardinia, and western as well as possibly southern Anatolia) that keep enhancing our understanding of the important role of Kommos as a major M commercial har- bour. Given the excellent stratigraphic sequences, these schol- ars promise to produce an analysis that for the first time distin- guishes numerous sub-phases of the LM I period. Also for vol. V, M. Shaw has concentrated on her chapter on the masses of plasters found throughout the Civic area. Among other aspects, she is examining the question of provenances and the light they can throw on the history of the plasters and the rooms they were used in. The chapter also includes a study of offering tables made of plaster, as well as a scientific analysis of plas- ters and pigments prepared by Alain Dandrau (Sorbonne, Paris). Progress is also being made with a monograph on house X, an extensive excavation preliminary report on which was pub- lished earlier by M.C. Shaw (Hesperia 62 [1993], 129-161). J.B. Rutter is two-thirds of the way through his detailed study of the plentiful LM I-IIIA2 pottery, unusually well stratified in the various rooms and courts. J.W. Shaw has been examining and writing up various categories of small finds (metals, loom weights). M.C. Shaw has started work on the frescoes as well as on the LM Shrine, a digital image of which was produced under her direction by Chris Dietrich last year.' Kounavoi, Pediados. G. Rethemiotakis (23rd EPCA) reports on the 1998 rescue excavation at the Eleutherakis plot: 'Further sections of the G cemetery were revealed with the discovery of 11 more tombs, which bring the total number to 16 (the 1993 excavation season was reported in ADelt 48, 463-4; Kritiki Estia 5, 315-17; and AR 1997-98, 116). A row of five small chamber tombs continues the line of tombs 4, 5 and 3 excavated in 1993. Tomb 6, which dates to PG-PGB, produced pottery including a LM IIIC krater, a cylindrical PG pithos together with three bronze buckles, 28 clay beads, a bronze razor, a gold ring and a incised bone object with con- tinuous scale decoration, possibly the handle for a mace. Evidence for the worship of the dead comes from tomb 7. The small pit grave contained a burial pithos supported upright by stones. The burnt bones were associated with one gold and one silver ring, a bronze spear and bronze dagger and a small stirrup jar, the latter positioned next to the pithos. A lekane, equipped with a spout and a pierced base, had been attached to the pithos rim, in order to receive liquid offerings. The pithos had been positioned below a rectangular hole, 1.10 x 0.90m. Its floor had a stone slab (0.90 x 0.72 m) and was found filled with dark soil, obviously the remains of the liquid offerings. The small tholos tomb 11 dates to PG but was found robbed. The entrance to chamber tomb 12 had been blocked by a dry-stone wall. It contained a pithos burial, equipped with an figure-of- eight spiral buckle, a Cypriot juglet with vertical incised lines, an aryballos and two LM I conical cups. Tombs 13, 14 and 15 were chamber tombs dating to PG, and contained</page><page sequence="131">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 131 one or two burials each, with pottery, jewellery and bronze objects. A pyre was found in front of tomb 16; the tomb con- tained two enchystrismoi, one associated with a 'killed' iron sword. The vases associated with the two burials were found in a lower layer'. Malia. S. Apostolakou reports on the excavation immediately N of the 1994 coffee shop, located next to the site's entrance. One basement room was completely excavated and sections of 4 others formed part of an MM III/LM I house, which had at least two architectural phases. Pottery was abundant: 63 coni- cal cups were intact, and most of the 41 stone objects had been used as tools. Other finds include a fossil of a complete triton, a sealstone, a clay scarab and a large number of obsidian blades. Numerous pumice pieces, probably used as building material, were found in all levels. EM pottery was collected from the lowest levels, suggesting that the area under excava- tion had a long use. (ADelt 752-3) A study season was undertaken in 2000 by P. Darque, A Van de Moortel and others (French School). The stone vases and polished tools were studied and 55 drawings of Neopalatial vases were made, and half the documentation of Neopalatial finds was completed. The day books concerned with the LM IB destruction and those Neopalatial deposits already studied were edited. Protopalatial vases were also studied and the transfer of the dig books onto a database was begun. O. Pelon studied the pottery deposited in the stratigraphic museum of the French School. He recorded on computer the sherds from early excavations which he had numbered in 1964/5, and complete vases from the E storerooms of the palace. These vases, restored at the time and stored, had been numbered and recorded on the plan when the shelter over the storerooms was replaced in 1985. He now registered these in an inventory, described them and entered them on a database along with other objects of the same provenance. These vases were restored and some of them drawn before being deposited in the museum strong-room. M. Schmid undertook an architectural study of the palace and oversaw restoration work of various kinds. The altar of the necropolis of Chrysolakkos, damaged by the collapse of the roof of reinforced concrete set up to protect it, was repaired and covered with a temporary shelter pending a decision on the con- struction of new roofing whose plans had been handed over to the Ephoreia along with plans for the roofing of the sanctuary of the Horns. Many walls in sector Mu of the palace were restored. Work was carried out by J.-C. Poursat in preparation for the publication of the Corpus of Minoan and Mycenaean Ivories of Crete. The descriptive records of the ivories in Herakleion Museum were edited, and work was begun on the ivories in the museum of Chania and the chapter about M ivory-working techniques. Phaistos. V. La Rosa (Italian School) reports on the 2000 season: 'Excavation was carried out in three areas: House LXXXVI- XCVI. Trial trenches were dug along the length or within the different rooms of the house, in order to record the structure systematically (not done until now) and, mainly, to verify the dating suggested by Levi. Old reports were re-read and checked, the heights of thresholds and the bases of walls were checked, floors already noted were in some cases redis- covered. This made it possible as a first step to define the sur- face levels (and at least two building phases) in the various rooms of the house, the finds from which Levi had dated to MM IIIA. The most surprising result was the discovery that the house had already been a large structure in MM IIB, and that during the following period it was simply re-adapted (with the addi- tion of a room or annex). Two foundation deposits were iden- tified, which made it possible to clarify the various architec- tural phases of the complex. The trenches showed a virtual absence of levels and struc- tures relating to MM IB (i.e. contemporary with the foundation of the First Palace). On the other hand, the preceding period, MM IA, is strongly represented; the presence of a flourishing settlement is confirmed, which explains the origin of the palace at Phaistos. Within the stratigraphical sequence, EM II levels were recorded, definitively proving that the Prepalatial period at Phaistos cannot be regarded (as was suggested by Levi) as a single short period, with no internal articulation. In certain trenches FN levels were reached. Area S of House LXXXVI-XCVI: here a long series of lev- els was identified from the backfills of earlier excavations up to Imperial R times. A large cutting in the wall of the pit (the cutting had been filled many times during the HL period) had removed all the previous levels down to a long wall of a house, probably of EM II date. This still had clay preserved on the walls, which was used as plaster. The excavation of this com- plex has not yet commenced, due to the danger caused by the large masses of soil (and mainly stones), which resulted from the fill of the HL cutting. The fragmentary state of the HL, G, Myc, and New Palace walls made it impossible to reproduce an architectural frame- work, allowing only the confirmation of its intense use in var- ious periods and the complex form of the archaeological 'palimpsest'. As in the trenches within the house, remains of MM IA floors and walls were recovered here also. What is interesting for the MM II and MM IIIA urban plan is the fact that no other residential building was situated imme- diately S of House LXXXVI-XCVI. Residential quarter SW of the First Palace. Archaeological activities in this area were arranged within a multi-disciplinary framework, with the residential quarter as the focal point. The aim was to find new evidence relevant to the problem of the existence of three palaces, destroyed and rebuilt one on top of the other, or of three storeys of a single building, destroyed by a single earthquake (a matter of debate between Levi and the two Greek scholars Platon and Zois). In a series of separate trenches, two rather than three build- ing phases were located (corresponding to the 1St Prepalatial phase and the Levi's 2nd phase). These were probably defined by two earthquakes, which took place within a short space of time. The building technique of rooms LX and LXIV, complete- ly different from that of the rest of the residential quarter, may indicate a partial rebuilding after the first destructive earth- quake. This rebuilding was probably interrupted by a second earthquake. Inside room LVIII and below the floor level, a series of at least six small ritual-type pits was identified, cut straight into the rock. The pits remained intact, and normally contained two small plates, all of MM II, placed so that their rims touch, ver- tical to the ground. Two more pairs of small plates, also of probable ritual use, had been discovered by Levi. Such a large number of deposits is so far unique at Phaistos, and probably indicates a collective ritual.' Ai-Giannis. Two rubbish pits with M and HL pottery, including HL stamped loom-weights were excavated in 1999. At the Lirakis field well and densely built HL buildings were discovered.

Although the bulk of the sanctuary finds date to the LG and Daedalic period, the presence of some C figurines implies that the sanctuary continued to function even after the abandonment of the acrop- olis during the Orientalising period. (ADelt 778-86) Excavation at the acropolis continued in 1999 in areas within the peribolos and outside on the NW and S sides. Additional work took place inside Megaron A, Megaron B and Megaron A and in the areas W and E of the sanctuary of Athena. An apsidal building was located at the NW end of the site. Probably a funerary building, it produced high-foot kylikes dated to LM IIIC-SM, together with badly preserved bones in a burnt level. Another LM IIIC building (building I) was used as a workshop and storage area. Its destruction deposit produced numerous larger and smaller ceramic vessels, 38 stone tools and vegetable remains. The areas excavated were conserved and access to the site improved. (Epyov YHH703, 176-7) Sokaras, KophinaS Municipality. An early Neopalatial build- ing was explored in 1999 at the Chalikias site.

Coulson (ASCS) in cooperation with the 24th Ephorate: 'The finds by sector were as follows: Area A: in the SSW part of area A three new rooms were uncovered. In the NNE part three megara came to light, one of which was slightly later than the main phase of Chalasmenos, probably PG, and a further series of rooms. Area B: a few stratigraphical trenches were conducted in B5, the most important room in this area, which revealed three successive floors, all dated within LM IIIC middle. Area C: a megaron-like structure was excavated, which proved to be the shrine of the settlement. The finds, of particu- lar significance, included fragments of five or six big figures of 'goddesses with upraised arms', snake tubes, pinakes with 'horns of consecration', a four-sided 'altar stand' with incised decoration, and pithoi. The excavation of the shrine was not completed in 2000. The shrine is connected to area A with a calderim-like ramp and it appears not to have been an entirely free-standing building, but attached at the ESE to another structure, containing big pithoi. Kataleimata: at the refuge settlement of Kataleimata build- ing C was investigated through stratigraphical trenches. Important remains of the Protopalatial period came to light, including pottery of very good quality and a chamaizi pot bear- ing hieroglyphic signs. Consolidation: various rooms in area B were consolidated; flagstone floors, benches and a staircase were repaired. Conservation and study of the finds: the conservation of pottery, from previous excavation campaigns as well as from 2000, proceeded. The study of the finds has advanced signifi- cantly during the afternoons at the INSTAP Study Center. The material found in 1992-1997 in areas A and B has already been studied. The processing of the 2000 campaign started this year. K. Nowicki progressed with the study of the finds from Kataleimata, especially those dated to the FN and MM II.' Chrisi (Gaidouronisi) island, Ierapetras.

(ADelt 755) Chrysokamino. Philip P. Betancourt (ASCS) reports on the 2000 study season: 'A number of separate activities occupied this season: Pottery from the metallurgy workshop was studied as two deposits. Sherds from the apsidal building are almost all from EM III (only one earlier sherd). Ceramics from this location include fine painted cups, bowls, and jars (all in White-on- Dark ware) as well as coarser pieces of domestic pottery. Pot bellows sherds from this deposit allow this class to be dated to EM III. The slag pile is more varied in date. It is not stratified, but it includes pottery ranging from FN to EM III. No restor- able vessels come from the workshop. Pottery from the Farmhouse. The farmhouse has two main periods of architecture, LM I and LM III. Sherds from earlier periods are also present, but there is no architecture that has been found from the early periods. The stratigraphy of the units from the site that have yielded the best and most exten- sive examples of EM and early MM sherds, trenches 38 and 43, were studied this season. A more complete study of the early fabrics from these units is planned for next season. Trenches to the S of the massive S wall that represents either an auxiliary kitchen or a storage area for ceramic cooking ves- sels were also examined. A second hearth, oval in shape and built of clay, was recognized as a feature in the centre of the room. Parallels for this type of hearth are known from several LM sites on the island. The season also produced irrefutable ceramic evidence that the sits continued in use until the LM IIIB period. Final study of several miscellaneous artefacts from the copper smelting workshop was completed this season. The site has yielded a tuyere, pieces of furnaces or chimneys, a piece of furnace lining, and a few other objects. A catalogue for publi- cation was completed. Yannis Bassiakos and his assistant spent several days studying the slag and the workshop site and its regional con- text. Their research continues to suggest that Kythnos is the closest parallel for the operation at Chrysokamino.</page><page sequence="134">134 DAVID BLACKMAN Architectural drawing: architectural cross-sections of rooms and walls at the Chrysokamino habitation location were made, in preparation for publication.

(Epyov Y77I703, 161) Istron. Barbara J. Hayden (ASCS) reports on the 2000 season of the Istron Mapping Project: 'In a short season several anc. to Ott-period sites within the coastal Istron area, on the Gulf of Mirabello, were mapped with an EDM. These included the FN/EM I, R and Venetian site at the tip of the Vrionisi promontory, at the E edge of the area to be mapped, from which there is scant architectural evidence. The FN and LR site on the islet of Vrionisi was also mapped. Features on this island that are anc. to mod. include cisterns, a tomb (both probably recent to mod. constructions), an enclosure wall of unknown date, possibly with an earlier, anc. phase, and fragmentary walls of rubble-built rooms. A FN/EM I settlement was based on the islet and must relate to contemporary pottery from the tip of the Vrionisi promontory. A possible LR/EByz monastery was also located on the islet, and in recent times sheep have been kept here (this perhaps accounts for the fairly recent rubble-built cisterns at the N end of the island). The date of the enclosure is unclear; local tradi- tion holds that the islet was used as a prison, and sections of the wall (i.e. the gate) are very well preserved. The enclosure is built on an earlier line of cut blocks, however, and certainly predates the large rectangular cisterns, which have been built up against the enclosure. Anc. walls that are probably part of the Gr settlement or polis of Istron on the promontory Nisi Pandeleimon were also mapped; these walls are located S of the promontory, between it and the coastal highway. Marble blocks from this area sug- gest that an important building may have been located here, either a temple or possibly an administrative building. Farther W, scatters of R pottery were mapped in the olive groves in the fan or delta of the Istron River, and a large, sub- merged R site at the base of the loannimiti promontory was mapped. This R site extends ca 150m E from the base of this promontory, from an area that bears the toponym Karavotasi (this is the small Turkish-period port of the villages of Kalo Chorio and Pyrgos). Walls on the beach, emerging from the water, are part of this R settlement, and appear with abundant pottery which is eroding into the sea. Parts of concrete struc- tures that may also be R in date were identified and mapped. This settlement is large for the survey area and may have an ER phase as well as abundant MR and LR pottery. Farther S, Turkish-period field houses that were recorded as part of the regional survey project were mapped and drawn.' Itanos. A section from a rim of a pithos with incised spiral dec- oration and the upper half of a figurine in the daedalic style were delivered to the Ephorate. These had been surface finds from the area of anc. Itanos. (ADelt 756) D. Viviers (French School) carried out a survey in 2000 of the area N of the Toplou-Vai road and E of the Palaikastro-Vai road. Aerial photos revealed more than a hundred sites in this area, which was divided into thirteen zones, of which seven were surveyed. The results were entered onto a database set up for the purpose. On more than half the sites in these seven zones, sherds were gathered to be studied in collaboration with the 24th EPCA of E Crete. A preliminary chronology for these settlements has been established, with two intensive occupa- tion phases, one superimposed on the other: a very dense occu- pation in the M period followed by an almost total desertion and one Gr re-occupation, essentially of the HL period. Although the city of Itanos, on whose excavation the Franco-Greek team have re-embarked since 1995, seems to have been the political centre of the territory in the Gr period, the absence of M remains suggests that the M centre must be elsewhere, possibly at Vai'. A study season on material from excavations in the pre- ceding years was also carried out. The team were able to com- plete the typologies, define the dating of several stratigraphic contexts and make significant progress in the study of human bone material from the N necropolis of the city including sev- eral pathologies.

A path was cleared from the end of the new field-road at the east of the site to the saddle and from there along the E slope where it was substantially widened and a new gate was made on the NE to allow visitors access but keep goats and sheep out. A stone staircase was constructed to the NE of room 8, between rooms 57 and 17, leading up to the W side of room 21 to provide easy access to the upper W slope and hilltop. The signs and new paths proved popular with the Crete 2000 par- ticipants and the local residents. Study of the Vronda site and material: Leslie Day wrote up buildings A/B, E, and L/M for publication and finished the pot- tery catalogues for these areas. During the study season the stratigraphy of Vronda was further refined. An early LM IIIC phase was discovered in room B4 and the lower deposit of B7, while room B3 and the later deposit in B7 were still dated as later LM IIIC. In building E a deposit of MM III-LM IA was recognized between the floor and the lower cobble fill. Plans and drawings of pottery artefacts from both the settlement and the cemetery continued to be digitized; photographs for publi- cation and samples for C14 analysis were selected. Geraldine Gesell finished the catalogue of the figurines from the Vronda settlement and continued her work on the cat- alogue of the shrine material. Scanning and digitizing of the inked shrine drawings also continued. Study of the Kastro site and material: Margaret Mook con- tinued work on her volume on the Kastro pottery, studying the pottery from upper levels of rooms 30-33 and 35 and lower levels of rooms 27 and 28-30, as well as cataloguing the pre- viously studied pottery from rooms 31-33, 35, 22-25, west of 6, and east of 24. The drawing, inking, scanning, and digitizing of the pottery continues; the black and white and colour pho- tography of sherd-groups from different phases was begun. Margaret Mook and Jennifer Tobin conducted a preliminary reading of significant deposits from rooms on the N and E Slopes to prepare for full study next season; 'The Kavousi Coarse Fabrics: A Ceramic Typology for the Mirabello Region of Eastern Crete' will appear in D. Haggis' survey volume and the Kastro pottery volume, and the Vronda settlement volume man- uscripts were revised. Kavousi display in the Ierapetra Museum: the display case with the shrine material is complete and a display of the win- dow frame from Vronda house is being prepared; it will include a watercolour painting of the decoration of the frame by Doug Fahlmann. The third Kavousi display, a reconstruc- tion of one of the Vronda cremation burials (Grave 26), is in preparation.' Krasi, Pediados (Kastellos site). Th. Eliopoulos reports on ille- gal excavation conducted at the early Gr site on the steep Kephala peak. LG-EA pithos fragments were collected. (ADelt 755) Krya Setias (Orthe Petra site). Th. Eliopoulos reports on the resumed excavation at this remote site, originally explored by K. Davaras in the 1970s, when part of a LM IIIC-PG cemetery of small tholos tombs was excavated at the foot of the Venetian castle of Monte Forte. One of the tombs excavated by Davaras belongs to the intriguing 'Isopata type', the only one still visi- ble on site. The current excavation revealed a large tholos tomb (tomb 28), located some 40m NE of the 'Isopata type' tomb and some 90m S of Orthe Petra. Tomb 28 is preserved intact except for the upper part of the tholos. Finds were located mainly along the N part of the tomb's interior and included 50 mainly PG vases (stirrup jars, bird-shaped askos, a clay fish, jugs, etc.), 7 buckles, 10 pins, 6-7 fragments of spear-heads, 9 beads, a bronze pendant, a N axe, etc. Amongst the collapsed roof mate- rial, located in front of the tomb's entrance, the fragments of a poros limestone pyramidal-shape object, incised with geometric motifs, probably adorned the top of the tholos and served as a 'cippus', an aniconic burial marker. (ADelt 750-1) Lagou-Pinakiano Lasithiou (Papoura Agiou Georgiou site). Th. Eliopoulos reports on the well known G-A site, located on the peak which forms the NW border of the Lasithi plateau, often identified with the town of Datalla recorded on inscrip- tions. Remains of an open-air G sanctuary were located: rock hollows were found filled with dark-coloured earth. Finds included animal bones, fragments of ritual vessels, many clay figurines (mainly bovid), a male clay figurine head wearing a helmet, four bronze figurines, three bovid and one bird (Fig. 192). A daedalic figurine was collected from the area. (ADelt 754-5) Mare Lasithiou. Th. Eliopoulos reports on the discovery of an extensive M settlement of at least four houses. which could have been a settlement for the exploitation of the Lasithi moun- tainous region in a fashion similar to Zominthos on Psiloreitis. In the past an MM 1 pyxis had been collected from the area, probably from a tomb set amongst the rock cavities. (ADelt 755) Maronia, Setias. An LM III tomb, which contained at least one larax and two vases, was destroyed during agricultural works in 1999. (Epyov YH70 3, 161) Mochlos. J. Soles and C. Davaras report on the 2000 season: 'We spent the 2000 field season conserving and studying finds from the excavations carried out in 1989-1994. We con- centrated, as we did last year, on the preparation of vol. III in the Mochlos Publication Series, Mochlos Period IV: The Mycenaean Settlement and Cemetery, expanded in a new syn- ergasia with Nikos Papadakis.

Maryann Schultz and Freya Evensen completed their study of pottery from house C.3 in the Neopalatial settle- ment on the island, while Kellee Barnard completed her work in Philadelphia on a stratified deposit just outside this house. Both projects are part of our preparation of vol. II, part 2, Mochlos Period III: Neopalatial Settlement on the Island, Houses in Blocks C and D. We also completed a map of the HL remains on the island which Natalia Vogeikoff has dated to the 1st Ct BC.' Neapolis. All preparatory work for the re-exhibition of the Neapolis Archaeological Collection was completed in 1999. Amongst the finds to be displayed are pottery, figurines and jewellery from Elounda, Aphrodisio and Dreros Merambelou, archaic inscriptions, HL coins etc. (Epyov YnnO 3, 161) Palaikastro. The maritime area was declared an archaeologi- cal zone because of the discovery of building complexes on the shore and anc. wrecks offshore. (Epyov Ynn703, 169) L.H. Sackett and J.A. MacGillivray (BSA) co-directed a further study season in 2000. They report: 'The following developments took place during the 2000 season: Publication: the Palaikastro Kouros volume, the first of our final reports, appeared as BSA Studies vol. 6. The full- length critical biography of Sir Arthur Evans by Dr J.A. MacGillivray appeared under the title 'Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth'. 'Palaikastro: Two Late Minoan Wells and their History', our second final report, with the analysis and typology of LM IB to LM IIIA2 pottery, notes on the sandstone 'horns of consecration', and the small finds, including the serpentine rhyton with relief dol- phins, is complete except for the seed report and the contribu- tion on the animal bones, which includes the important deposit of almost intact Ichnelates - the indigenous Cretan hunting dog. 'Palaikastro: building 1-Sacred Space in Transition': L.H. Sackett has recast the account of excavation and stratigraphy to incorporate an updated sequence of ceramic contexts for the third of our final reports; work should be completed by the end of the year. 'Palaikastro: building 5' is scheduled as the fourth of our final reports and S. Thome and M. Prent are currently writing the context summaries and descriptions of the many important LM IB and LM IIIA deposits in this rich building, while MacGillivray strews the primary deposits and supervis- es the conservators who have begun restoring the vases. The new MM IIIB and LM IA pottery project was completed by Dr Carl Knappett and Mr Tim Cunningham who studied and con- served close to 450 whole vases from primary deposits in buildings 6 and 2. Their work will be submitted to the Annual of the BSA for final publication of these important deposits, which should go a long way to help resolve the current MM IIB-LM IA controversy. The first phase of the spatial analysis program under the supervision of Prof. Jan Driessen (gathering the material at Palaikastro) was completed; the second phase, on a database at Louvain, is in progress. The collection of architectural data was covered this past summer. Apotheke work. Work on finds management, including the use of the new database, aims to improve the accessibility of all excavated materials and is currently under the supervision of our archivist H. Parton, who also supervised the transfer of all the sherd lots from the old to a new pottery store in Angathia. Geophysical survey. Two teams of geologists worked on the Palaikastro Harbor project during May-June; their reports fol- low. They intend to complete this 3-year project in 2001. The Fitch Laboratory team carried out resistivity and magnetometer surveys in an area S of Block Chi, with promising results.' Two teams continued geophysical, geological and topo- graphical surveys in 2000 under the aegis of the BSA. Dr Floyd McCoy (University of Hawaii) reports: 'Geophysical surveys: a Geoscan Research Resistance Meter (RM 15) was used for subsurface geophysical surveys in the playa area and adjacent to the excavation. Maximum pene- tration was im. Traverse lines at both survey sites were orient- ed NW-SW and spaced 1 m apart. Resistivity data from the playa illustrated the same pattern of anomalies as that obtained from electromagnetic inductance (EM) measurements in 1999. Magnetic gradiometer data were unclear but somewhat repli- cated these patterns. Such similarities in the playa data strong- ly infer that patterns outline a buried topographic feature, per- haps a former LBA outlet for the river that drains through Palaikastro. At Chiona beach, the primary outlet to the sea for the river was about mid-beach, marked today by numerous rounded boulders and cobbles on the surface. Overwash from LBA floods was diverted into the modem playa area (in the LBA probably crossing an alluvial slope rather than a playa) with an outlet to the sea at the far southern end of the beach adjacent to the promontory (Fig. 193). Resistivity data from the survey near the entrance to the excavation also replicated patterns mapped in 1999 during EM surveys, suggesting man-made structures. Whether these pat- terns represent ancient harbor structures in the playa and build- ing remnants near the excavation remains to be tested. Geologic and topographic surveys: twelve sites were done onshore by a combination of coring and augering, mainly the latter, and two sites offshore. Samples taken from these sites will be processed for sedimentological, geochemical and microfossil characteristics. Results from field observations appear to support the hypothesis that the playa represents the southern outlet for the Palaikastro river during the LBA. Numerous thin layers and laminae of sands and rounded grav- els document high-energy (storm and flood) events. A thick layer of angular gravel at the base of some holes may represent non-marine alluvial deposits. Intervening muds, sands and angular gravels are interpreted as fluvial deposits from over- bank deposition during floods. Red and dark-grey/black clay 193. Palaikastro: site of geophysical survey</page><page sequence="137">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 137 layers appear to be a non-marine alluvial or paleosol deposit that underlies modem beach-sand deposited during the post- LBA sea-level transgression. Additional sedimentary features looked for included tephra (ash or pumice) to suggest tsunami from the LBA Thera erup- tion or erosion off land after the eruption, fragments of burnt brick to suggest correlation with destruction levels at the LBA city, pot sherds to indicate approximate time-stratigraphic rela- tionships, and displaced marine macrofauna/flora to indicate storms or tsunamis. Pumice was not noticeable. Possible parti- cles of burnt brick (small, red, friable particles may be mud brick fragments) were identified. Pot sherds were found as deep as 2m subsurface concentrated in the lower layer of angu- lar gravel. Preliminary observations of pottery sherds recov- ered in sediment samples suggest dates from MM through LM (courtesy of Dr MacGillivray). Playa sediments in general were brown and light grey representing oxidized depositional environments. Anoxic black muds formed thin laminae within the grey clay sequence - inadequate volumes were present for C14 samples. It seems clear that the Chiona beach area may not provide all the necessary information to decipher LBA sea-level posi- tion, settings for LBA harbors, or landscape depictions. Local fishermen claim to have seen rock alignments suggestive of walls in about 10m of water approximately 80m E of the promontory. If true, this might indicate significantly more sub- sidence of this area than has been previously assumed, and might point to new areas for investigating LBA sea-level indi- cators and harbor installations; recent geophysical modeling of crustal deformation due to tectonic and hydro-eustatic effects may substantiate this. Measurements of tidal changes found a range of 22cm dur- ing spring tide conditions and about 10cm during neap tides. Whether this range reflects purely oceanic tidal variation or has an additional component from atmospheric pressure changes remains unknown. Such a tidal range is surprising and may have significance for understanding ancient harbor installa- tions. Offshore bathymetry mapping was done to water depths of over 4m by swimming offshore with a measuring tape and use of a hand-held acoustic echo-sounder. These data are interesting: a shoaling of depths off the N portion of Chiona beach is indicated by an offshore bulge in depth contours - this sits opposite the proposed LBA outlet for the river and may represent the former delta of the river during lowered sea-levels. Underwater rock exposures surrounding the promontory are delineated by bathymetric patterns. The inshore position of the im isobath near the center of East beach identifies this area as a zone for increased erosion from modern storm waves. Research at the ASCSA in 1999-2000 (by F. McCoy) suggests an LBA sea-level position in this area of E Crete of about -2.5 to -3.5m below modem levels - the corresponding isobaths off Chiona and East beaches may thus outline the LBA coastline, presuming a thin sand blanket off- shore. Additional locations within the excavation area of tephra deposits from the LBA eruption of Thera were studied and sampled. New exposures of tephra were found and document- ed within tumble and debris from a destroyed building now exposed in sea cliffs along the northern part of the promonto- ry. Interpretation of all exposures suggests that primary, undis- turbed portions of the air-fall ash are preserved, and may indi- cate an ash thickness of up to 10-12cm over eastern Crete after the LBA Thera eruption. An inventory of tephra samples in the archaeological collection at Aghios Antonios continued with the identification of numerous samples that may not be ash or pumice. At the end of this summer, 287 samples from excava- tions up to 1996 had been studied. An exciting new program to model the generation of tsuna- mi by the LBA eruption of Thera, and the effects of tsunami along the northern and eastern coastlines of Crete in terms of wave run-up or inundation zones, was started in cooperation with Dr Costas Synolakis (Univ. Southern California). Remote sensing: kite surveys were done over the excava- tion, the fields to the west and south of the excavation, and over the coastal area (promontory, playa, Chiona beach). Data processing is not yet complete, but field observations of elec- tronic images indicated excellent and crisp images. Repeated thermal infrared (TIR) emissitivity measure- ments across baulk EM-ES on cloudless, sunny days, indicat- ed that thermal anomalies occurred wherever buried walls were present beneath the baulk. Along the baulk, the depth to the buried walls varied from 10-40cm. Repeated measurements of thermal characteristics of individual building stones at building 6 - white limestone, dark grey limestone, sandstone (ammoudia/ aeolianite), and purple schist and slate - indicated little difference in thermal signatures between the rock types. Conclusions are, first, that thermal anomalies do not reflect individual rock types (limestone, schist, etc.), but do reflect a subsurface accumulation of rocks such as in a buried wall; sec- ond, that height (position of the hand-held sensor) of measure- ment above the ground, at least between 0.1-1m, does not affect temperature values; third, that wind strength seems to have little effect on anomaly definition; and fourth, that ther- mal anomalies are most pronounced during mid-day, and are poorly defined prior to about 10.00 before ground heating and after about 13.00 when the upper meter of the ground surface seems to come to thermal equilibrium. Reviewing one hundred years of excavation and interpre- tation at Palaikastro, Dr Jim Peterson of Monash University has asked a series of questions: (1) Maritime trade must have been a key to prosperity, but the site excavations have so far failed to uncover a harbour-side. Where can the Roussolakkan harbour-side have been? (2) A thousand years of pottery mak- ing: where did the clays come from? (3) The ruins (stone walls) were excavated from beneath debris derived from the collapse of the mud-bricks that once surmounted them. The ruins stand among stony soils, and so where did the 'mud'/clays come from? (4) Why did the people of Roussolakkos have to re- locate their wells from time to time? (5) The stone blocks, of which the walls are made, include some with 'exotic' litholo- gies. Where did they come from and what might an analysis of the source terrains lend to the process of landscape reconstruc- tion? (6) The archaeological record shows that the Roussolakkan site was subject to a series of occupations, aban- donments and re-occupations throughout the Minoan period, but not afterwards. Was the demise of the Roussolakkan site due, or partly due, to landscape change? The Monash team's conclusions after the 2000 season are: 'The coastal reconstruction, based on extrapolation of rela- tive erosion rates, points to BA Palaikastro Bay being a much better harbour than it is at present, because the immediately post-Flandrian-transgression sheltering promontories that mark the ends of Chiona Beach would have been significantly longer then than they are now - Fig. 194 shows the inferred BA coastline and harbour. The crestal capping of Kastri (a fos- sil coral reef) has been extrapolated in the same line to a hypo- thetical distance. The cemented conglomerate ridge (canyon cobble bed) that forms the Promontory has also been extrapo- lated in the same line to a hypothetical distance. Together these 2 'arms' would have provided a safe haven for BA mariners.

Palaikastro: inferred BA coastline and harbour 195. Palaikastro: 'Red Pit Valley' would have exposed once-sheltered harbour-side facilities to destruction, and progressively reduced the status of the port. The clays are from a nearby valley that looks wide and well- developed enough to be natural, but it is, in fact, artificial: a quarry in disguise, as mapping of the truncated surfaces of cemented scree shows. About 850,000 cubic metres of pebbly clays have been removed from this 'valley', nearly all attribut- able to Minoan times. This 'valley'/quarry has been dubbed 'Red Pit Valley'. The name 'Roussolakkos' means 'red pit'. See AR 1999-2000, 144 Fig. 219, showing the view S from Kastri (90m) across the valley towards the slopes of Petsofas (about 1.5km distant). The Roussolakkos excavation site is marked. 'Red Pit Valley' is cut across the fall of drainage that is marked by incision of bedrock by gullies cut directly down slope below Petsofas. This valley is regarded as artificial because the break-of-slope surrounding it truncates cemented scree that pre-dates the quarrying. Fig. 195 shows the current and (dotted) inferred Minoan contours for the 'Red Pit Valley' area. This quarrying progressed from E to W and would have changed groundwater movement under Roussolakkos, thus dictating the digging of new wells. Evidence for the abandon- ment (apparently sequential) of wells has already been found by archaeologists during site excavations. The stone wall building was linked to quarrying, the nature of which reveals information relevant to landscape reconstruc- tion. There were three main sources: the local talus apron, the Cape Tenta purple schist outcrops, and Ta Skaria ashlar/aeo- lianite. At Ta Skaria, an aeolian sand ramp emplaced about 64,000 years ago (during an interstadial) later became cement- ed to form an aeolianite suitable for quarrying. Aeolianite for- mation and quarrying together have reduced the volume of the original sand ramp by about 212,500 cubic metres. Fig. 196 shows the current and (dotted) inferred Minoan pre-quarrying contours for Ta Skaria. In conclusion: Clearly the Minoans had to cope with land- scape change, some of which they initiated themselves. The search for the 'missing harbour' should now concentrate off- shore, and will be undertaken during the 2001 field-season (if permits are granted).' Praisos. Dr J. Whitley (BSA) reports on the fifth study season of the material picked up in the Praisos survey in 1993, 1994 and 1998: 'The principal objective was to date the material from these sites more precisely than had been achieved in previous study seasons. In this we were greatly assisted by the typology of fineware bases for 6th and 5th-Ct material from site 14 (Prophitis Ilias) developed by Mr B. Erickson (ASCS) in 1999, and by help from Dr N. Vogeikoff (ASCS) and Ms Nassar (French School). The sherds identified by Erickson, and those picked out by Vogeikoff and Nassar from Praisos itself, were used as a reference collection with which to date other materi- al from both sites. Considerable chronological precision was achieved with much of the material from Praisos. The work allowed us to reach some definite conclusions.

Tripitos: room F hearth Praisos are rare, was mistaken. There is a considerable quanti- ty of EHL and MHL material from Praisos, though none that would be inconsistent with a presumed destruction or aban- donment of the site in the years just before 140 BC. We were also able to use Erickson's type series to date many finds from Praisos to the 6th and 5th Cts. We were also able to identify some 4th-Ct material - that is, material later than that with which Erickson was familiar and clearly earlier than the HL. Pedestal bases for some kind of drinking cup (possibly a kan- tharos) seem to be particularly common in the 4th Ct. Some of these bases are decorated with elaborate rilling or rouletting, for which neither we nor any of our visiting experts can find any parallel elsewhere in Crete. It is likely that this represents a distinctive local type, which we have called the 'Eteocretan rilled kantharos'.' Traostalos, Zakros. S. Chrysoulaki reports on the 1995 exca- vation season reported in Kritiki Estia 7 (1999) 310-17 and AR 1999-2000, 145-6. (ADelt 756-8) Trypitos, Setias (B. Plakaki-B. Drakaki plot). N. Papadakis reports on the continued excavations which have revealed the remains of a small but important town (for previous reports see ADelt 49, 746-7 and AR 1999-2000, 146). The 1995 excava- tion season revealed more rooms in areas F and B, which belong to town houses. Area F5 proved to be a watch-tower of the town's fortification wall; room F4 was equipped with a rec- tangular hearth (Fig. 197). Most important finds were a single- handle kyathos and series of stamped amphora handles. Amongst the finds located in the area of rooms F2, F3, F4 are a coin of Chersonisos, dated according to Svoronos to 370-300 BC (F2), a lamp and a fragment of a clay plaque depicting the front half of a running dog (F3), two perfume bottles, a clay relief depicting a female head, a sling-bullet, inscribed AIOI (F4). Further excavation in area B (rooms B8-11) revealed that areas F and B belong to a single architectural unit, with a com- mon and impressive entrance, 1.50m wide, built with a series of poros slabs held together by lead clamps. The area outside the main entrance was paved. Amongst the most important finds of room B11 are perfume bottles, a cooking pot, two small amphoras, a handleless cup, fragment of a clay figurine, a bronze coin of Lyttos, dated according to Svoronos to the 3rd-2nd Ct BC. One of the small amphoras contained 23 bronze nails, which presumably had been placed there by the house owner. (ADelt 749-50) Vasiliki lerapetras (Kephala). Th. Eliopoulos reports on the continued excavation at the large 'Dark Age' settlement located on the Kephala hill. A total of eight rooms (E 1-E8) were exca- vated, which form part of the important building E, associated with LM IIIC pottery. Room E2 had a column, with a stone base (di. 0.40m); the architectural arrangement resembles the ground plan of the G shrine at Dreros. Room E4 had a H-shaped stone bench associated with three cylindrical bases, possibly sections of goddesses with upraised arms (Fig. 198) and the lower part of a 'snake tube'. Building A (9 x 9m) is located to the NE but at a lower level, of which three rooms were excavated. (ADelt 754) Viglia Ierapetras (E. Petrantonaki plot). S. Apostolakou reports on the excavation of a section of the quite extensive cemetery of Ierapetra, organized in rows. All tombs, which date to the early centuries AD had been robbed. (ADelt 753) S. Apostolakou reports on the discovery of badly preserved R buildings (N. Rainaki plot). In the same area R buildings of the anc. town of Hierapytna had been found, (ADelt 37, 389; 41,234). (ADelt 753) Zakros. A study season as well as conservation work were conducted under the direction of E.N. Platon. (ADelt 2000, 107) Ziros. The upper part of a large bronze vessel, a bronze fibula, two bronze discs, together with pottery and fragments of fig- urines were delivered to the Ephorate. All objects date to the HL period and are said to have been collected from the Arogalida site in the area of anc. Praisos. (ADelt 756) Minoan Roads Research Programme. S. Chrysoulaki reports on the excavation at Kokkino Phroudi covered in Kritiki Estia 7 (1999) 317-21 and AR 1999-2000, 147. (ADelt 758-60) Fieldwork concentrated in 1999 on sites located at the areas of Skalia, Pano and Kato Zakros and Xerokambias. At the Schoinares site of Pano Zakros a fragmentary potter's wheel implies the existence of a M workshop for the produc- tion of ceramics, especially since close by ceramic wasters had been located in the past.

Vasiliki Ierapetras: figure fragments</page><page sequence="140">140 DAVID BLACKMAN Skala tou Agiou Antoniou, the main road which connected Kato Zakros with Palaikastro, a shallow 4 x 4m depression was found to contain burnt pottery, small pebbles and few frag- mentary figurines. The site, probably a sanctuary with strong similarities to peak sanctuaries, dates to the old palace period. The absence of human figurines and human limbs is an note- worthy distinction from peak sanctuaries. At Peristeras, at the foot of Traostalos, fine pottery, large numbers of sea pebbles, miniature cups and a fragment of an MM II tripod offering table with interior decoration, suggest an open-air sanctuary. Both sites, being located at some distance from known sites but at a close proximity to ancient roads, could be associated with such a sanctuary. At the fort of Choiromandres Zakrou excavation revealed that the last occupation phase of Area II dates to LM IB. Pottery collected from below the latest trodden earth surface provide an MM IIIB-LM IA terminus post quem. A lentoid sealstone depicting the sun and a seated lion with raised head and tail came from the same level. In Area IV, a sounding below the LM I floor revealed an MM III straight-sided cup. (Epyov YHHO 3, 179-81) WESTERN CRETE Agios Vasilios Valley Survey. Jennifer Moody and Alan Peatfield (BSA) report on the 2000 season: 'The goal of this study season was to continue with our analyses of material collected by the Agios Vasilios Valley Survey Project in 1991, 1994 and 1997. Our goal was to com- plete finds analysis of our large sites and then begin to deal with the small ones. We also planned to finish cataloguing all small finds. The 2000 season accomplished most of these goals. From the beginning of the survey in 1991, we felt that sites dating to the LB/EIA transition were unusually well-represent- ed in the Agios Vasilios Valley. The valley is naturally fortified and fertile, only a few hours walk from the S coast, but unseen from the sea. Two big EIA citadels (Frati and Myrthios Kirimianou) guard entry to the valley from the S coast. Access points to the valley from the interior are not marked by citadels. Topographic parallels with the Xeropotamos valley S of Vrokastro, or the Avgo valley to the E ofKavousi Kastro, are striking.' Aptera, Apokoronou. V. Ninou-Kindeli reports on the 1995 excavation season at sector IV (Saridaki plot), covered in Kritiki Estia 7, 167 and AR 1999-2000, 147. (ADelt 733) An ambitious project for the conservation and site presen- tation of anc. Aptera commenced: anc. building remains, pre- served to an impressive height, were conserved as were the large water cisterns. The W anc. approach road was located, whereas the Byz and Venetian roads used until today were improved. A Hero6n was discovered outside the city's main entrance and bath installations among the N buildings. (Epyov Ynno 3, 163) Argyroupoli, Rethymnis. E. Gavrilaki reports on the excava- tions conducted at mod. Argyroupoli, a settlement founded on the site of anc. Lappa, located on a hill, surrounded by the rivers Petres and Mousellas. In area 1, building remains with two architectural phases produced ample pottery, 35 metal objects, 3 coins, 4 clay and 11 stone objects. Area 2 revealed more building remains associated with a dark-coloured destruction deposit (associated with the latest architectural phase), which contained pieces of carbon, plaster fragments, bone objects, pottery and glass vases. The earlier architectural phase dates to LH and the later to the 3rd Ct AD, when the entire settlement was destroyed. According to anc. sources Metellus destroyed Lappa in 68 BC, after the fall of Kydonia, Knossos, Eleutherna and Lyttos. Lappa turned against Antony during the R Civil War and was subsequently much favoured by Octavian. This period is associated with extensive con- structions along the N and S coasts of Crete, new coins and construction of public buildings. After the 3rd Ct AD earth- quake, Lappa entered the first Byz period more subdued. (ADelt 741-2) Chamalevri. Palaioloutra. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki and E. Papadopoulou report on excavations conducted along the Kakavella hill, where anc. remains were much destroyed by deep ploughing. LM IIIB badly preserved building remains were associated with two architectural phases (eight walls). Large quantities of pottery were collected, obsidian fragments, a bovid figurine and two vases. Four rubbish pits contained ample LM IIIB pottery, three complete vases and a fragmen- tary clay figurine in a worshipping posture. The Kakavella hill was extensively occupied in LM IIIB, with building remains concentrated at the Poloudakis plot and large concentrations of rubbish pits at the Chatzidakis plot. On the contrary, the Tsigouriana hill was occupied in MM I and subsequently in LM IIIC. Pateras. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki reports on the rescue excavation at the large plot, located on the Tsigouriana hill, E of the Pateras and Bonalis sites. To the E, an MM I building was located, and at the N end of the plot MM I rubbish pits. At the centre of the plot an LM IIIC: late building was located (five badly-preserved walls). At a lower level LM IIIC1 rub- bish pits were identified. Melissa. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki reports on the discovery of MM and LM IIIC pottery along the E site of the Tsigouriana hill. Only one badly preserved wall was identified, which sug- gests that the MM and LM IIIC settlements did not extend to all parts of the hill. (ADelt 742-3) Chania (N. Charokopakis plot): M.

Andreadaki-Vlasaki reports on the excavation at the cemetery of Ag. Demetrios, where the exca- vation of the MM III/LM IA apothetes within sector I was completed. A total of 3,562 complete conical cups and bell- shaped cups were discovered, although the original number of thrown cups was at least triple. Most vessels were found smashed and scattered. Sherds of utility vessels, such as tripod cooking pots and large cooking lekanai, pithos sherds, braziers, large vessels with a tall foot, like amphoras, and decorated vases. All were found thrown among boulders, pebbles and</page><page sequence="141">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2000-2001 141 stones together with thrown-in layers of natural red soil. Bedrock was reached at 0.90 to 1.70m. The pit (apothetes) at its N end was wider and shallower. Sherds belonging to larger vessels were usually found at the deepest levels. Two stone objects, probably tools, a disc loom-weight, carbon and plaster fragments, broken bones, many obsidian blades, three bronze fragments and bones belonging to large animals (Cretan wild goat) were also found. Mrs Andreadaki-Vlasaki concludes that the objects found within the apothetes are the remains of a rit- ual ceremony, which took place at the nearby rural sanctuary. The only architectural remains found in sector III during the 1984 excavation season at the Lygidakis field are sparse remains of walls, which could be associated with such a sanctuary. The architectural remains found in sector I could be asso- ciated with a sanctuary installation, but date to LM III: a NE-SW peribolos wall running for 20.30 m continues further W. The peribolos wall is badly preserved and sometimes only the foundation boulders or the foundation trench are preserved. Two pits containing pottery were excavated, one producing a small kalathos with horizontal handles: the two snakes in relief added to the interior of the vessel denote the ritual function of the vessel. The first 1 m of a well was excavated, but its bot- tom was not reached. The nearby Argyriou plot, located NE of the apothetes, produced LM pottery and one conical cup. (ADelt 733-6 and Kritiki Estia 7, 179-83) Episkopi, Rethymno (Tripolitaki plot). E. Gavrilaki and P. Karamaliki report on the rescue excavation conducted along the E bank of the Mousellas river. The general area is related to anc. Ydramia, located N of anc. Lappa together with anc. Phoenix, Apollonia, Lamona and Psychion along the S coast. The foundations of a large R public building were revealed. It had two architectural phases dated to the E and LR period. MM sherds were collected, which could be associated with sherd concentrations along the E and lower sections of the hill. (ADelt 739-4 1) Gavdopoula Island. The shores of this island were declared an archaeological site because of the discovery of building complexes on the shore and anc. wrecks offshore. (Epyov Ynn 3, 169) Gavdos Island. In Karave Bay a submerged quay of a R har- bour installation was surveyed by the EMA. (Epyov YHnO 2, 151) The excavation of the impressive R farmstead located S of Sarakiniko was completed with the discovery of an olive press installation. (Epyov YnnO 3, 164) Grambousa Island. Iron cannon were located by the EMA from a wreck of the period of the Greek War of Independence, one dating from the 17th Ct (Venetian occupation of Crete).

Markoulaki reports on the continuation of the extensive excavations conducted in the centre of anc. Kisamos during 1995, 1996 and 1997 (Kritiki Estia 7, 183-97 and ADelt 736-9). Health Centre plot: The W part of sector I was investigat- ed in order to define the W borders of the R villa. The ground floor rooms in this area did not reveal mosaic floors. The rooms on the upper floor, however, had mosaic floors, which were found collapsed onto the earthen floors of the ground floor. This stratigraphical situation was universal throughout the ground floor rooms and within the largest part of the adja- cent room 11, adorned with the mosaic executed by the Antiochea artist. So far, no other part of the villa has produced mosaics belonging to the upper floor. Large upper floor mosa- ic fragments maintain a 16cm bedding of large pebbles and plaster. The nucleus is of 1cm thick pure lime, below which is a thinner mixed layer of a pink plaster and sherds. These upper floor mosaics preserve traces of geometric designs; they prob- ably adorned bedrooms. Along the ground floor traces of wall decoration is preserved (red colour). Most important find was a lead-sealing recording: IouXio-o KaXo, oioyiat 1. Bronze coins, including one well-preserved of Julia Mamaea (228 AD) were found within the destruction deposit together with lamps dating to 2nd and 3rd Cts AD. Fire destruction marks were abun- dant throughout the building. In trench 5 the undisturbed destruction deposit was rich in finds and included architectur- al elements, large quantities of pottery (with good terra sigilla- ta) and fine Pompeii-red plaster fragments. In trench 6 the destruction deposit contained a coin of Alexander Severus (222-285 AD). Trench 9 revealed parts of a drain, which con- tinued E and is probably associated with a viridarium. In trench 11 the villa walls were preserved up to im. The destruction deposit was extensive and rich in architectural elements. The room revealed in trench Y1-P2 was equipped with a small semi-circular hearth associated with burned cooking pots. Six rooms with earthen floors were found on the Kisamos Church plot. Along the W sector an impluvium was paved with white-grey marble slabs. A three-colour mosaic floor depicting marine themes dates amongst the earliest found at Kissamos, 1st half of 2nd Ct AD. On the Nikolakis plot parts of a large R house which had two consecutive architectural phases were excavated. Ten rooms were defined: some equipped with earthen floors, others with mosaic floors, the latter belonging to the second architec- tural phase (dating to 1St half of 2nd Ct AD). The house was occupied for a long time, from the 1St Ct AD until the 3rd Ct AD. Along the N and S side of the plot, earlier occupation phases date to C and HL periods, possibly associated with some workshop installation. A site on the Aligizaki plot had been used during the R and Byz periods, the latter associated with sparse architectural remains dating to the 6th Ct AD. Nine rooms belonged to a R house destroyed or abandoned at the end of the 3rd or begin- ning of 4th Ct AD. Room V had a mosaic floor depicting Leda embracing a swan. (Kritiki Estia 7, 183-213) M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki reports: On the Petromichelakis plot, ECh building remains were found associated with earth- en floored rooms. A paved floor dates to the R period. Six R coins were collected from within a drain installation, one depicting the Emperor Trajan. Phournarakis plot: architectural remains were much dis- turbed; four pithoi were the most interesting find. Apostolakis plot: part of a R peribolos was discovered, which continued under the adjacent plot to the N. Four occupation phases were defined on the Rokakis plot, the earliest dating to the early HL and associated with a pit, found filled with pottery, and wall foundations. The founda- tions of five different walls date to the R period, and they were</page><page sequence="142">142 DAVID BLACKMAN 199. Pantanassa, Amariou: bronze krater probably associated with water and linked to the main drainage system of R Kisamos. During the ECh period the area was used as a cemetery (seven graves were discovered, containing only oinochoai as offerings). A burial dating to the Med period and a well were found along the much-disturbed surface levels. Xerouchakis plot: in the EOtt period this site was part of the organized Ch cemetery. Gerola located to the NE a small sanctuary possibly associated with the cemetery; 19 graves were excavated and Venetian, LR and ECh levels were identi- fied. A building complex dates to the early Imperial period. The earliest occupation phases date to the 4th Ct BC and are associated with large quantities of LC pottery. Located E of the Lousakianou river, the Moraitakis plot revealed five walls possibly part of the foundations for a water mill dating to the LR period according to the architectural char- acteristics of the structures discovered. Pottery was sparse and undiagnostic. P Drosinou reports on the excavation at the Theodorakis plot, located within the Venetian castle of Kisamos. Small and large rubbish pits were found containing HL and R pottery but also Venetian and Ott, obviously associated with different occupation phases. Building remains were located along the S side of the mod. plot, which were used during the HL and R periods. (Kritiki Estia 7, 213-21) Kastelli. In 1999 the excavation of the R villa was com- pleted. (Epyov YHHO 3, 164) Pantanassa, Amariou. E. Tegou reports on the rescue excava- tion conducted at Eremoklesies in the SE foothills of Mt. Veni, where a tholos tomb was discovered. The S entrance was found blocked with a monolithic slab; the tomb was built of ironstone middle-sized rubble. A large slab had been used as the roof's cover stone; it was found broken in two presumably from the pyre, which covered the entire tomb roof. A well-preserved large piece of carbonized wood and a small fragmentary jug were found. A second pyre covered the tomb's dromos, which produced two bronze spear-heads and fragments of an iron buckle. The following finds were discovered within the tomb: two urns, a bronze amphoroid krater in the E part (Fig. 199); a pithos in the W. Closer to the entrance and to the E a stirrup jar and small jug were found. An amphora containing the deceased's ashes had been positioned inside the pithos, togeth- er with few fragments of bronze. The bronze amphoroid krater contained, apart from ash, two daggers and pottery. Pottery dates to LM; the amphoroid krater and small lekythos suggest close contacts with Cyprus, well known during the 11th Ct BC. (ADelt 746-7) Patsos, Amariou. V. Ninou-Kindeli reports on excavation con- ducted at the sanctuary of Hermes Kranaios at the Agios Antonios site along the Patsianos gorge. Objectives of the 1995 season were the further exploration of the areas in front of the church entrance and the area of the HL pyre. A thick layer of black soil, in mod. secondary deposition, containing plentiful pottery, animal and human figurines, ani- mal bones, teeth and horns, was found in front of the church's entrance. Pottery is predominately G, although earlier and later material was identified. In the area of the rock shelter an extensive pyre layer was discovered, part of which had been identified in 1989. The area was used over a long period of time: superimposed pyres took place on the natural rock, which were not associated with any built construction. A few slab-like stones were probably thrown in the pyre in order to extinguish the fire rather than forming part of a built construction. At lower levels of the sloping hill, large concentrations of black earth filled with carbon were located, probably from redepositing pyre debris. Figurines seem to have been posi- tioned amongst the rocks. Pottery is predominantly HL, although earlier and later sherds are present. Excavation results imply that cult activities were performed outside the rock-shel- ter and that the natural rock arrangement played an important part in defining the rituals performed. Finds belong to an open air sanctuary. (ADelt 744-6) Pera Galini, Mylopotamou. E. Tsivilika and E. Banou report on the second excavation season at this coastal M site (Fig. 200). Remains of houses were exposed associated with fres- co fragments and fragmentary pottery. Near walls 8 and 9, high quality fresco fragments with banded decoration and imitation of marble veneering were found together with frag- ments of stone vases, clay incense burners, tripod legs and conical cups. A stone offering table and a natural triton are also reported. These finds were found near a room equipped with a bench, possibly a shrine. Collapsed building remains suggests that the M settlement was destroyed by earthquake. (ADelt 743-4) Sphakia.

Papadopoulou reports on the discovery of a R tiled-roof tomb, which contained a sin- gle burial associated with only one small jug. (ADelt 743) Stavros. Three isolated stone anchors were found by the EMA, probably PR and each weighing over 130kg. (Epyov YIHIO 3, 166) Sybritos, Amariou. N. Prokopiou, L. Rocchetti and A.L. D'Agata report on the 1995 excavation season at the LM IIIC-SM settlement. North sector: the most interesting find was the G deposit within a rectangular construction defined by small stones and pebbles, which abutted wall 20 of the LM IIIC settlement. It suggests that LM IIIC structures were still visible during the G period. To the E, LM IIIC and G occupation phas- es were identified. South sector: excavation of the large G building Al and the adjacent paved road continued. Superimposed floor layers were defined. The building was carefully constructed; its size and long use suggests that it served the community and subsequently had a different func- tion from the domestic structures excavated along the NE and SE sectors. The different use of this monumental building, which dominates the Amari valley, is also attested by its dif- ferent use during the Iron Age, which continues during the LR period. Another road section (NE-SW) was discovered which dates to the R period. (ADelt 747-8) Anna Lucia D'Agata and Nota Karamaliki report on the 2000 excavation campaign: 'In 2000 the Greek-Italian excavation campaign at Thronos/Kephala (anc. Sybrita) focused on the central area, the N plateau and the S plateau. One of the main aims was to identify the limits and extent of the central area, occupied by the ritual pits, and of the N plateau, which was the habitation area during the Dark Age. The NE limit of the central area, ending with a steep rocky slope about 1.50m in height, has been brought to light and close to its border pit 54 has been discovered. The material recovered from within it can be attributed to an early phase of LM IIIC and includes remains of 38 clay vases (Fig. 201: a deep bowl or hydria), a bronze blade, two stone tools, the whole skeleton of a dog as well as part of a second, the remains of a terrapin (Chlemis caspica), few bones of medium-sized mammals (sheep/goat) and few human bones. Pit 54 appears to have been excavated to the E of building 1, a two-room struc- ture excavated in 1990 and characterized by a large, oval fire- place which occupies most of the S room. Axiality and the presence of a fireplace allow this building to be classified as a megaron structure. Its position on the border of the central area, its orientation towards the plateau where the pits were dug, and its topographic connection to pits 53 and 54, support the hypothesis that the function of the building was determined by the events which originally led to the excavation and filling up of the pits. To the NE of the central area, at a lower level, a new ter- race (N plateau II) has been discovered. Like the one previ- ously found (N plateau I), it was probably artificially created and seems to represent the extension of the N plateau I towards the E. The limits and extent of N plateau I, an artificial terrace whose borders do not coincide with those of the moder ter- race, have been almost entirely identified in this campaign. On its W side the excavation of building 3, partially brought to light in 1993, has been resumed. The earliest floor levels of the building, which also include a large fireplace and go back to the LM IIIC period, have still not been entirely cleared. On the S plateau excavations concerned building Al, paved ramp 42 and the area to the S and E of building A2. As for G building Al, to the S of ramp 54, brought to light in 1999 at the SW corer, the clearing of the bedrock was done, taking off a huge layer of PG date used by the builders of Al to fill in the area. It consists of material of domestic derivation also including many remains of bronze objects and, although not in situ, represents the earliest trace of occupation so far discovered on the S plateau. It also confirms the existence on the site of a PG phase of some importance. Above building Al, R paved ramp 42 - oriented N/S and now exposed for a length of about 10m and for a width of 8.40/8.60m - includes two low steps and is linked to building A2 through a large, rectangular roofed area. The ramp appears to have been the final stretch of a path leading up to Kephala from the core of the R town of Sybrita, located in the area of the modem vil- lages of Thronos and probably also of Ayia Photini. We strongly suspect that part of the path still leading up to the hill along its S slope and partially paved, could be as early as R. In Early Imperial times the S plateau, the one overlooking the Amari valley, functioned as a public area. Its focus was build- ing A2 which has not been entirely brought to light; however, it looks like a stepped stoa and on its front the base for a stat- ue still survives. To the S of building A2, and in room 1 on its E side the last phase of occupation dates to the 3rd Ct AD. After this date the entire complex, including also paved ramp 42, was abandoned. Traces of an earlier phase dating to the 1st Ct AD have also been identified, suggesting the existence of two main chronological foci in the occupation of Kephala in R times.' EPHORATE OF PALAEOANTHROPOLOGY AND SPELAEOLOGY In 1998-99 the Ephorate continued work on the recording of caves and the production of maps (palaeontological, anthropo- logical, biological and archaeological). The map of Attica is already prepared, and others will follow (by Nomos). In 1998 study seasons were carried out on cave material from: Kleisoura Prosymnas (Argolis), Prophetes Elias Rizoupolis (Attika), Cave of the sources of the R. Angites (E. Macedonia), Alepochori-Kouveleike 1 and 2 and Kalamakia (Lakonia) and Lechove (Korinthia). In 1999 cave diving in Diros cave (Lakonia) located very important palaeontological remains: Hippopotamus amphibius, Panthera leo, Crocuta crocuta, Dama dama,</page><page sequence="144">144 DAVID BLACKMAN Monachus monachus and birds not yet identified; petrified remains of an elephant from Roupaki (Eleia) were conserved and studied; and excavataion at Epanome (Central Macedonia: Nome of Thessalonike) found a large proboscid trunk. Significant anthropological finds were the skeleton found in situ at Kouveleike cave 1 (a man of 25-30, dating from FN); and Mes skeletal remains from Kythnos. Cave excavations in 1999 included: Areopolis-Kalamakia cave (see AR 1999-2000, 38-9) in Lakonia; Lakonis near Gytheion in Lakonia: a complex of 5 caves used in MPal and UPal; Kouveleike Caves 1 and 2 (Lakonia); Prosymna (Argolis); Lechove-Kryoneri (Korinthia). The cave at Chrysospelia on Pholegandros was restored by a volunteer group. A programme of presentation of 'tourist caves' was devel- oped in 1998-99 in cooperation with the National Tourist Organization, starting with Divos (Vlychade) in Lakonia, Petralona (Chalkidike) and Koutouki Paianias (Attika); the problems of conservation have received particular attention. The creation of a Museum of Caves remains a principal aim of the Ephorate.

UNDERWATER SURVEY Dr Michael Wedde (Norwegian Institute) reports on a new project initiated by the Institute in 1999: 'The Greek-Norwegian Deep-Water Archaeological Survey is a joint undertaking by the Greek Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities (EMA), the Norwegian University of Science and Technology at Trondheim (NTNU) and the Norwegian Institute. Its main goal is to survey the seabed in selected areas in Greece using advanced underwater technolo- gy, and thereby generate a database of submerged archaeolog- ical sites as an aid to their protection. The project is co-direct- ed by Ms Katerina Delaporta (EMA) and Dr Marek E. Jasinski (NTNU). The co-operation was initiated with a one-week pre- season conducted in the N Sporades. The purpose was to famil- iarize the Norwegian team with local conditions, both above and below the water surface. A number of known wreck sites were visited with the NTNU side-scan sonar so as to create a catalogue of computer images. The technicians learned to dis- tinguish the digital imprint of the amphora mounds of wrecked merchantmen from natural rock formations and outcrops which create similar representations. In the process four new potential wrecksites were identified, of which one was con- firmed by EMA divers and dated to the Byz period. In 2000 the research area was moved to Ithaka for the first full season. Over two weeks the team gathered digital data around Ithaka and in the sound between Ithaka and Kephallonia. Despite the very uneven seabed, characterized by a rapid drop to depths beyond 100m and a rocky terrain, which caused some difficulties due to its tendency to create digital images very similar to that of a wreck, the work with the sonar resulted in a comprehensive coverage of the NE coast of Ithaka. Close to one hundred targets were catalogued, of which a selection was made for verification. Employing the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) of the Sperre A.S. company from Norway allowed the team to eliminate a number of possible targets as being elements of the seabed. Two new wrecks were extensively documented using the ROV. This involved collecting video footage for the study and dating of the amphoras (at first contact they appear to be Late Republic/Early Roman Empire in date), and creating a full dig- ital coverage for photo-mosaics. One of the two wrecks has been extensively damaged by sports divers, while the other consists of a complete amphora cargo at a protective depth. A third wreck consisting of roof tiles was only partially docu- mented since a greater number of tiles had been noted than were found by the ROV. Further work in the area is necessary in 2001 on a cargo of lead bars, so a return to the site is planned.'
