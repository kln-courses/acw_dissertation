<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION IN SERVIUS J. W. JONES, JR. T HAT PART of the later tradition of Vergil which may be called alle- gorical interpretation has never been studied separately and in detail.1 When it is, one of the important chapters in the account will necessarily be con- cerned with the allegorical notes in the Servian Commentary.2 The aim of this paper will be to indicate briefly the nature and extent of such notes in the commentary on the Aeneid. As a prelude to the present discus- sion, it is necessary to indicate what is meant by allegorical interpretation. The few classical scholars who may be regarded as authorities on the subject differentiate as allegorical those inter- pretations which are clearly "other than" the ones which might be sug- gested by a literal rendering of the text under consideration.3 We do not propose to deviate from their practice. It may well be asked, of course, whether Servius labels with the term allegoria the notes that are here treated. The answer is negative. The explanation for this seemingly strange situation lies in the peculiar force of the ancient word. Allegoria as used by the Latin writers referred to a figure of speech, in particular to that figure which arises from a succession of metaphors. Only at a very late date did it begin to denote a type of inter- pretation, as the English derivative "allegory" often does.4 Servius finds examples of the allegorical figure in the Eclogues and Georgics and so alle- goria (or the adverbial forms allegori- cos or allegorice) appears from time to time in his commentary on these works; 5 in the Aeneid, he discovers no examples; therefore the word is to- tally absent from his notes. Antiquity developed four forms of in- terpretation which in modern times have been classed as allegorical: 6 (1) the historical, according to which real persons and events are thought to be represented in a covert manner; (2) the physical, by which the gods of pop- ular belief are equated with physical forces in nature; (3) the moral, by which divinities are identified with ab- stract qualities or by which ethical significances are ascribed to actions and situations not ostensibly ethical; and (4) the euhemeristic, by which gods are rationalized as deified heroes, or mythological stories are rationalized</page><page sequence="2">218 J. W. JONES, JR. as historical occurrences. All four of these traditional forms are represented in the Servian Commentary on the Aeneid. In addition, there is found a type of allegorical interpretation for which there is no previous ancient tra- dition. Lacking a better name, I have designated this type as allegorism ex ritu Romano because of its interest in abstruse religious lore. The various kinds of Servian allegorical explana- tion may now be taken up individually. Of the first type mentioned, the his- torical, examples are scattered through- out the commentary on the Aeneid, but only fifty-three notes are involved.7 In other words, historical allegorism in Servius is pervasive, but sporadic. This condition follows logically from the basic assumption upon which the com- mentator proceeds. That assumption is that Vergil in passing touches upon facts of history which according to the laws of poetic art he cannot express openly: . . . per transitum tangit his- toriam, quam per legem artis poeticae aperte non potest ponere.8 Among the notes that fall in the pres- ent category, those that are likely to be of greatest interest today are the ones that center on the interpretation of the figure of Aeneas. In particular, the extent to which Aeneas represents Augustus is a point about which many might like to know the commentator's opinion. Servius assumes that one of Vergil's purposes is to praise Augustus through his ancestors: Intentio Ver- gilii haec est, Homerum imitari et Au- gustum laudare a parentibus (ad Aen. Praef.). He therefore recognizes in acts or deeds ascribed by the poet to Aeneas precedents or origins for similar acts or deeds of Augustus (ad Aen. 3. 274; 3.276; 3.280; 3.501). In one case, he sees in an accomplishment of the em- peror the fulfillment of a promise made by Aeneas to Apollo (ad Aen. 6. 69). At no point, however, does Ser- vius declare that Augustus and Aeneas are one and the same, or that Aeneas is a mere "puppet reproduction" of his most illustrious descendant. Perhaps the closest the commentator comes to making an identification between the two individuals is in regard to the games celebrated in Aeneid 5, where he admits that Vergil's description may owe something to the games giv- en by Augustus in honor of Julius Caesar in July, 44 B.c. (ad Aen. 5. 45; 5. 556). Only once is Augustus outright- ly identified with someone else. Jupi- ter's statement in his speech in Book 1, that Quirinus together with his brother Remus will give justice, means, says Servius, that Augustus together with Agrippa will rule (ad Aen. 1. 292). Here, Augustus is equated with Romu- lus. Many of Servius' examples of histori- cal allegorism are quite trivial in na- ture, but some of the comments that might be so classified are of immense importance to a study of this sort since they show the typical allegorical mind at work. At times, for instance, Servius sees an almost mystical significance in numbers, especially three or a mul- tiple of three.9 Dido, dying, gives presage of the three Punic Wars by rolling over on her couch three times (ad Aen. 4. 691). The breastplate of Mezentius is dented and pierced in twelve places as a sign that the Etrus- cans were divided into twelve tribes (ad Aen. 11. 9).10 On other occasions, well known historical occurrences--of the kind that may have come to be treated as no more than topoi in the hands of the schoolmasters - are be- lieved to be reflected by Vergil in the Aeneid. Thus, according to Servius, the hiding of Sinon in the marshes really represents a similar experience involv- ing Marius (ad Aen. 2. 135).11 In still</page><page sequence="3">ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION IN SERVIUS 219 other cases, the commentator suspects obscure allusions behind epithets of people and places. Nursia, he declares, is described as frigida either because of its cold climate or because the Nur- sini were, as the Gracchi alleged, men of criminal dispositions (ad Aen. 7. 715). Anagnia is styled as dives as a result of its fertility or because Antony order- ed that money be struck there in the name of Cleopatra (ad Aen. 7. 684).12 Several historical allegorical inter- pretations that one might expect to come upon are conspicuously absent from Servius' Commentary. Though the interpreter is clearly fascinated by Cae- sar's comet or star and finds allusions to it at the slightest provocation,13 he takes Acestes' flaming arrow as a dire omen rather than as a reference to Caesar's catasterism (ad Aen. 5.524). In his exegesis of Aeneid 4, he makes no attempt to connect Aeneas and Dido with actual historical personages. So much for historical allegorism. The second type of interpretation to be discussed here is the physical. Physical allegorism in Servius results from the theory that the poet portrays the an- cient gods and goddesses at times as anthropomorphic beings, and at times as mere physical phenomena. Vergil is thought to follow a physica ratio (sys- tem of naturalistic principles) from which he departs and to which he re- turns.14 The explanation offered for such a dual portrayal of divinities is that the gods though really incorporeal may take to themselves human bodies if they wish to be seen by mortal eyes: S . . dii cum volunt videri, induunt se corporibus propter mortalium oculos; nam incorporei sunt (ad Aen. 7. 416). Allegorical interpretations on the physical principle occur in approxi- mately thirty-five notes. Servius first resorts to this form of exegesis early in the commentary on Aeneid 1 in order to explain how Juno may be called both the sister and wife of Jupiter. The per- tinent note (ad Aen. 1. 47) may be sum- marized as an example of the com- mentator's method. Juno, equated with air (the lower sky, the air enveloping the earth) may, Servius points out, be said to be the sister of Jupiter, equated with aether (the upper sky, the fiery periphery of the universe), because the elements adr and aether are both tenu- ous. She may likewise be considered the wife of Jupiter because the aer is lo- cated beneath (is subject to) the aether. The other divinities who comprise part of the physica ratio, and the physi- cal elements or powers with which they are usually equated are: Neptune (as the sea or moisture in general); Pro- serpina (as terra); Cybele (also as terra);15 Ceres (as earth the consumer of dead bodies); Minerva (as the high- est part of the upper air); Vesta (as earth the container of fire); Vulcan (as the fire that flies through the air); 16 Janus (as the air or the universe); Iris (as the rainbow); the nymphs (as fresh water); and Venus (as sexual power or energy). Cerberus also enters into the physica ratio, duplicating the role of Ceres as earth the consumer. Most of Servius' physical interpreta- tions are clearly unthinkable. Some, however, gain a certain amount of plau- sibility from the poetic settings to which they are applied. Scenes in the Aeneid in which there is a close association of gods or goddesses with elements of na- ture (e.g., the storm scene in Book 1 and the "marriage" of Dido and Aeneas in Book 4) at least lend encouragement to such a line of reasoning.17 Servius himself invites conjecture as to the source of his physical comments by now and then attributing an interpre- tation to the physici. The physici, or natural philosophers of Greece, were, to be sure, among the first to make wide-</page><page sequence="4">220 J. W. JONES, JR. spread use of physical allegorism to reconcile their doctrines with popular belief,8s and it is not strange that the commentator should recognize them as a possible origin for some of his ideas. One is tempted, however, to pon- der whether Servius does not frequently consult as a more immediate source the teachings of a particular philosophic sect whose adherents might be called physici. The Stoics at once come to mind. That the commentator depends to some degree upon Stoic lore for parts of his physica ratio is rendered highly likely by the fact that parallels for his physical interpretations can often be found in Cornutus' Theologiae Grae- cae Compendium, Pseudo-Heraclitus' Quaestiones Homericae, and in those sections of Cicero's De Natura Deorum assigned to the Stoic interlocutor. 1l A Stoic source which could have served as Servius' ultimate authority would be the sixteenth book of Varro's Libri Di- vinarum Rerurn, in which the chief gods of the Roman state were introduced as physical phenomena.2 Fourteen additional Servian notes do not represent any of the conventional identifications of divinities with natural elements, but belong, nevertheless, in any discussion of allegorical interpreta- tions of the physical type. One of these (that on the Gates of Sleep at the end of Aeneid 6) illustrates well to what lengths of fancy the commentator can go when it suits his purpose. The fact that Vergil assigns true dreams to the gate of horn and false dreams to the gate of ivory has, declares Servius, a physical explanation. By the gate of horn are signified the eyes, which are of a horn color, and are hardier than the other parts of the body since they do not feel the cold. With the eyes one sees only things that are true. By the ivory gate is signified the mouth with its teeth, and, as everyone knows, some- times the mouth can speak falsely (ad Aen. 6. 893). The third major variety of allegorical interpretation in Servius is the moral or ethical. Twelve of the eighteen notes that represent this type are applied to Aeneid 6. The present discussion, there- fore, will, for the sake of brevity, con- centrate on Servius' moral allegorizing of this one book. While one might ex- pect to discover more moral interpreta- tions in other parts of Servius' exegesis, it is not surprising that so large a num- ber (proportionately speaking) should be included in the commentary on Ver- gil's nekyia. To Servius, Book 6 of all the books of the Aeneid seemed richest in those "deeper meanings" one might term allegorical. As he himself puts it (ad Aen. 6 Praef.): "All of Vergil is filled with knowledge, in regard to which this book (the sixth) holds first place, . . . Some things here are said simply (simpliciter), but many points are taken from history, many things are said with special reference to the deep lore of the philosophers, the the- ologians and the Egyptians . The conception of the universe which Servius sees embodied in Book 6, in ef- fect, frames the whole underworld scene as an extended allegory and as- serts as a corollary that Vergil is simply using the traditional representa- tions of Tartarus and of the underworld in general as poetic forms to clothe profound moral and philosophic trutlhs. The universe of Book 6, says Servius, should be understood as geocentric. Surrounding the earth are nine concen- tric circles (or spheres). The seven clos- est to the earth are the orbits of the planets (the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn). The two outermost spheres are known as the "great circles."2' Considered from any point on the periphery of such a universe, the earth is infima. Earth and</page><page sequence="5">ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION IN SERVIUS 221 the place of the inferi are therefore the same, and Tartarus is a poetic fiction. The nine circles girdling the earth are symbolized by Vergil in the nine cir- cuits of the Styx in the "lower world." The spirits of the inferi, of which Vergil offers a description in Book 6, are, in reality, to be found in their proper places in these circles (ad Aen. 6. 127). Since Tartarus is a myth, and earth and the place of the inferi are the same, it follows, by Servius' reasoning, that the punishments of Tityos, the Lapiths, Ixion, Pirithous and others, as de- scribed in Book 6, symbolize earthly sit- uations, just as Lucretius (3. 980-1023) maintained. Tityos is said to be spread out over nine iugera because he was a lover, and lust is rampant far and wide. The Weeping Fields stretch out in all directions because the number of those in whom lust dominates is the greater (ad Aen. 6. 440, 596). The forests through which Aeneas must pass on his way to the underworld have a symbolic importance. They sig- nify darkness and the haunts of wild beasts in which savagery and lust reign supreme. These things hinder the re- turn of souls ad auras by polluting and defiling them (ad Aen. 6. 131). Inasmuch as Cerberus is really earth, the consumer of bodies, Charon's re- mark that Hercules chained the animal and dragged him trembling from the underworld is a figurative way of say- ing that the hero contemned and sub- dued all earthly lusts and vices (ad Aen. 6. 395). The golden bough the commentator compares with the symbol of the letter Y. Pythagoras, says Servius, used this letter as a sort of diagram of human life which at the earliest age is given over neither to good nor evil, but which, beginning with adolescence, follows ei- ther the path on the left, of vice, or the one on the right, of virtue. Vergil's de- scription of the topography of the "lower world" proves that he has in mind the Pythagorean symbol. Aeneas entering Hades takes a path that will divide into branches, the fork to the right leading to the place of the wicked (Tartarus), the fork on the left leading to the place of the virtuous (Elysi- um). 2" Servius, as is perhaps obvious even from what little has been said in this place, brings under contribution for his moralistic interpretations of Book 6 nu- merous philosophic doctrines. No single school is followed, but rather a number seem to be represented. The Epicurean poet Lucretius and Pythagoras have been mentioned here. It is very prob- able that in many cases interpre- tations are drawn from contemporary thought. 23 If such is true, one of the most important lessons to be gained from these notes is that the various philosophies of Servius' day were vir- tual seedbeds of allegorical material. The fourth form that Servian allegor- ism takes, the euhemeristic explana- tion, is clearly a favorite method with the commentator even though a mere forty-two notes qualify for consideration under this heading. Generally the sub- ject of Servius' euhemerism is some mythical beast or monster mentioned by Vergil, and few of these there are that escape rationalistic treatment. Since the traditional gods are as a rule rationalized by physical principles, it is in no way striking that euhemerism in the original sense of rationalization of gods as deified heroes is found only with reference to Jupiter, Faunus, Ja- nus, Saturn and Phorcys.24 Several points in Servius' position mark him as a typical adherent of the euhemeristic theory of mythology. Like the euhemerist Palaephatus and the eu- hemerizing historian Polybius, he be- lieves that the mythical stories are by</page><page sequence="6">222 J. W. JONES, JR. and large fabrications contrived by the poets and others.25 Like Palaephatus and Polybius, too, he assumes that un- derlying each myth is a germ of truth which may be discovered if one can, by euhemerism, penetrate the shield of po- etic and popular imagination.26 One note indicates some concession to mythical fancy. Defining fabula, Ser- vius declares (ad Aen. 1. 235): . . fabula est dicta res contra naturam, sive facta sive non facta, ut de Pasi- phae. Here our author grants that the fabulous, while always contrary to na- ture, may sometimes be taken as lit- erally true (or facta). That he makes this admission with reluctance is shown by a later note. In regard to Vergil's remark that the Centaurs have their abode at the entrance to the under- world, or in foribus, the interpreter, who understands this phrase to mean the entrance to life, writes (ad Aen. 6. 286): "Well does the poet say in fori- bus because those things which arise contrary to nature immediately per- ish. "27 If Servius is forced begrudgingly to admit the possibility of certain mythi- cal creations, what, it may be asked, is the compelling factor? The commenta- tor nowhere gives any hint, so conjec- ture is necessary. The answer, however, may be quite simple. Perhaps he had from time to time been impressed by deformities he had observed both in hu- man beings and in animals, and this impression had led to a slightly less than absolute view regarding the ra- tionalization of myth. In other words, the monsters that one finds today in the medical dictionary tended with Servius to give support, albeit little, to the idea of the existence of the monsters of poet- ic and popular fancy. Few, if any, of Servius' euhemeristic interpretations are his own. Frequently he cites his authority. Writers men- tioned are: Varro (ad Aen. 1. 52), Sal- lust (ad Aen. 3. 420), Hyginus, the commentator on Vergil (ad Aen. 2. 15), Septimius Serenus, the second-century poet (ad Aen. 6. 289) and Eratosthenes (ad Aen. 2. 7). In other places, where Servius makes no citation, it is often possible to find parallels for his com- ments in authors who belong in the main line of euhemeristic tradition. In particular, repeated coincidence with Diodorus Siculus is noteworthy.28 With respect to the figures Faunus, Janus and Saturn, Vergil himself defi- nitely suggests euhemeristic meanings (cf. Aen. 7. 48, 177-82). With regard to all the other beings made the object of euhemerism by Servius, the commen- tator must be said to be forcing a per- sonal view on the Aeneid. Through a manifestly "allegorical" predisposition, however, he finds in seemingly innocent expressions used by the poet in his mythical narrations - expressions such as fama est and ut fama est - support for his own interpretations.29 By these expressions, says Servius, Vergil aims to excuse fabulous accounts (ad Aen. 3. 578). Up to this point the four conventional forms of ancient allegorical interpreta- tion have been treated. It remains now to consider a type for which no ancient models can be adduced, namely, alle- gorism ex ritu Romano. Since this type of allegorism involves a new concept, a few introductory re- marks are in order. Brief reference must first be made to the Saturnalia of Macrobius, another ancient work which purports to explain religious ritual as supposedly mirrored in the Aeneid. In the Saturnalia, where one meets the person of the omniscient Vergil, the in- terlocutor Praetextatus sets out to prove the poet's close familiarity with points of Roman religious ritual (3. 1-7). His principal thesis is that in a single</page><page sequence="7">ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION IN SERVIUS 223 word which to the common man seems to have no extraordinary significance Vergil often hides a special sense.30 Praetextatus' exposition, however, hard- ly ever reaches the allegorical stage. His comments add some recondite con- notations to the words of the poet, but they do not pervert Vergil's literal meaning or controvert his sense. Considered against the background of Macrobius, it is clear that allegorism ex ritu Romano simply represents the culmination of a process. The writer of the more esoteric religious notes in the Servian commentary agrees with Ma- crobius in imputing an enormous amount of religious knowledge to Ver- gil. Like Praetextatus, this writer notes that the poet's words often have a spe- cial propriety when religious subjects are touched upon (ad Aen. 3. 463). Un- like Praetextatus, on the other hand, he at times becomes so obsessed with the idea of Vergil's knowledge of obscure religious matters that he finds evidence for this knowledge where none exists. The poet's literal meaning is complete- ly distorted and the result is a form of interpretation which must definitely be classed as allegorical.31 By a conservative reckoning, there are twenty examples of allegorism ex ritu Romano in the commentary on the Aeneid. By far the most remarkable in- stances comprise a part of the exegesis of Aeneid 4. In this place, it is declared that Aeneas and Dido in their relations with one another (in particular, in their marital relations) represent a flamen and flaminica, respectively (ad Aen. 4. 103). A few of the comments may be recapitulated for the sake of illustra- tion. Dido, says the allegorizer, should have remained true to the dead Sy- chaeus because it was not permissible for a flaminica to remarry. A flamen, on the other hand, could marry again if his first wife had died. Accordingly, Aeneas, in wedding Lavinia, was guilty of no sinful act, since Dido was no longer alive. No special consideration had to be shown the memory of Creusa in the matter of remarriage, since she had predicted that her husband would obtain a royal wife (ad Aen. 4. 29). The purple garment, or laena, which Aeneas is wearing when Mercury flies down to Carthage with his message from Jupiter, is really the tunic of dou- ble thickness which the flaminica wove for her husband after his installation. The jasper-studded sword Aeneas has at his side corresponds well with the long knife used by the flamines and flaminicae for sacrificial purposes. Moreover, the flight of Mercury and the poet's comparison of him to a bird represent the augural ceremony by which the flamen was installed (ad Aen. 4. 262). It may have been noticed that in re- gard to allegorism ex ritu Romano we have referred to notes in the Servian commentary, but we have not attrib- uted these notes to Servius. We have spoken rather of the writer of the more esoteric religious notes or of the alle- gorizer. For this procedure there is good reason. All the notes exemplifying religious allegorism form part of the so-called scholia of Daniel and although these scholia are included in the stand- ard edition of Servius,32 they are, by almost universal agreement, not from the hand of the commentator. Accord- ing to what is probably the prevailing view they derive either directly or in- directly from the lost Vergil commen- tary of Aelius Donatus.33 If the scholia of Daniel be accepted as the disiecta membra of Donatus' work one question that bears on this study begs an an- swer: why did Servius, who excerpted freely from Donatus,34 disregard the notes here discussed under the heading of religious allegorism?</page><page sequence="8">224 J. W. JONES, JR. Two explanations may be suggested. First, it is probable that in matters of religion Servius was an extremely so- phisticated person, being much more inclined to philosophy than to the tra- ditional worship. This conclusion is not based on any ancient biographical ref- erence35 or upon any statement made by the commentator relative to his own personality or belief.36 It is based rather upon the peculiar synthesis of notes that he has made from the great amount of interpretative material at his disposal. The Commentary on the Aeneid, as the examples of physical and moral allegor- ism contained in it show, clearly em- phasizes a philosophic approach to the understanding of Vergil. A second theory is that Servius con- sidered abstruse allusions to Roman re- ligious ritual inappropriate for the age in which he wrote. In Donatus' time, there was still some vital interest in the old Roman cultus, and it was natural that this interest should be reflected in the first great Vergil commentary. By Servius' day, on the other hand, such interest had been drastically curtailed, especially by the ban placed on pagan worship in the temples by Theodosius (381 A.D.). Servius, by emphasizing the philosophic aspects of Vergilian exege- sis and de-emphasizing its religious as- pects, in effect modernized it and gave it more of a contemporary appeal. This may help explain why his commentary survives while that of Donatus, for all of its great reputation, does not. With respect to Aeneid 4, it must be added, Servius may have a more par- ticular reason for not resorting to re- ligious allegorism. In his introduction to his commentary on that book the com- mentator asserts that Vergil is wholly dependent for the story of Dido and Aeneas upon the third book of Apollo- nius' Argonautica in which Medea is presented as a woman in love: Apolloni- us Argonautica scripsit et in tertio inducit amantem Medeam: inde totus hic liber translatus est (ad Aen. 4. 1). Servius thus seems to be intimating that, in his opinion, Vergil's model for his portrayal of Dido is Medea. Such an opinion, together with its corollary de- velopment - the matching of Aeneas with Jason - would preclude the pos- sibility of the commentator's identifying Dido and Aeneas with the flaminica and flamen of Roman religion. It would also explain why our author never associ- ates these characters as they appear in Book 4 with actual historical persons. The principal points of Servian alle- gorical interpretation have now been outlined, and it is time for some general conclusions. One conclusion is readily apparent; namely, that allegorical com- ment forms a very significant part of the commentator's exegesis. Though the number of notes upon which the pre- ceding discussion has been based (182) is not imposing considered against the total contained in the commentary, we can hardly overestimate the effect these notes would, if they should be accepted, have upon a person's under- standing of the Aeneid. The allegorical interpretations of the moral type on Book 6 tend, for example, to shape the meaning of that entire book. The same may be said about the pseudo-Servian allegorical interpretations ex ritu Ro- mano on Book 4. Servius is, of course, not allegorical in the sense that some of the medieval expositors of Vergil are; that is to say, our commentator does not offer an alle- gorical treatment of the Aeneid ac- cording to a single system or plan. In a variorum commentary one expects many kinds of interpretation to meet and cross. In Servius, this is as true of the various forms of allegorical inter- pretation as it is of other types. Servius -and thus the current paper clearly</page><page sequence="9">ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION IN SERVIUS 225 demonstrates - knows all the varieties of allegorical interpretation which pa- gan antiquity evolved, and he uses now one, now another of these varieties as they are available or as they seem to him fitting. Several times in the course of the present study we have remarked upon the appropriateness of individual types of Servian allegorical interpretation. Generally speaking, Servian allegorism can be said to be of little value for the understanding of Vergil, because it is imposed upon the poet rather than de- rived from him. It is largely the product of the mind of the commentator him- self or of the minds of those from whom he borrowed. A goodly number of the historical notes and a few of the physi- cal comments have, nevertheless, a degree of aptness. To these notes the present-day student of Vergil may turn for aid; to these notes whoever writes the final story of the allegorical mean- ing of the Aeneid must give serious consideration. Ohio State University 1 Comparetti (Virgilio nel Medio Evo, ed. G. Pasquali), Tunison (Master Virgil) and Zabughin (Vergilio nel Rinascimento Italiano, da Dante a Torquato Tasso) have, to be sure, chapters or sec- tions on the allegorical interpretation of Vergil. Since, however, these authors discuss simultane- ously numerous aspects of the poet's fortleben with a view toward creating a general picture, their treatment of the allegorical aspect of that fort- leben is somewhat cursory. It is my fond hope that in the near future I may begin a work which will concentrate exclusively on the allegorical interpretation of Vergil through the centuries, amplifying the points made in general studies and also, perhaps, adding some new considera- tions. 2 To this time there has been no careful analysis of the allegorical notes in the Servian Commen- tary on the Aeneid. One of the few scholars to recognize their existence and importance was itmile Thomas, Essai sur Servius et son Commen- taire sur Virgile (Paris, 1880) pp. 243-46. 3 Cf. K. Miiller, "Allegorische Dichtererkliirung," PW, Sup. vol. 4, col. 14-22, and J. Tate, "Allegory, Greek" and "Allegory, Latin," The Oxford Clas- sical Dictionary, pp. 38-39. The title of "stand- ard authority" definitely belongs to both MUiller and Tate, who have contributed, in addition to the articles just mentioned, a number of more specialized pieces. A brief, but helpful, treatment of allegorical explanation as practised by the Greeks is A. B. Hersman's Studies in Greek Allegorical Interpretation (Chicago, 1906). For those types of allegorical interpretation which have philosophic origins Eduard Zeller, The Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics, trans. 0. J. Reichel (London, 1880) pp. 354-69, may be consulted with profit. 4 The point is conclusively established by Miiller in his dissertation (De interpretatione poetarum allegorica apud Graecos Romanosque [Breslau, 1924]): "Miller weist darauf hin, dass Allegorie urspriinglich rein rhetorischer Fachausdruck ist = fortgesetzte Metapher. Der Sinn, den wir damit zu verbinden pflegen, erhielt das Wort erst spat. Daffir wurde hup6noia gebraucht." I have quoted the review by Georg Lehnert in Bursian's Jahresb. vol. 285, p. 35. Regrettably, efforts to locate the dissertation itself either in this coun- try or in Germany through the Zentral Katalog have been unsuccessful. 5 See, for example, the notes ad G. 1. 36; 2. 541; 3. 291; 4. 117; ad Ecl. 1. 1; 1. 29; 2. 6; 3. 93; 8. 12; 9. 23; 10. 17; 10. 71. 6. See the sources cited in note 3. 7 All the allegorical notes collected for this article are listed, by categories, in the appended table. The Servian text followed is that of Thilo and Hagen (Leipzig, 1880-1902). 8 Ad Aen. 1. 382. The same assumption is par- tially reiterated by such introductory formulae as aliqua ex historia derivat (ad Aen. 5. 45), miscet historiam (ad Aen. 6. 69), tangit his- toriam (ad Aen. 2. 557), tangit . .. latenter his- toriam (ad Aen. 2. 683), per transitum tangit historiam (ad Aen. 4. 159), adludit ad his- toriam (ad Aen. 7. 684), and de historia tractum est (ad Aen. 11. 743). 9 Now and then, it is possible not to justify, but at least to suggest explanation for, an allegorical interpretation by reference to something in the work that is being elucidated. Certain passages in the Aeneid (e.g., 1. 261-77) may reveal a pref- erence on the part of Vergil for three or a multiple. 10 Cf. ad Aen. 5. 560; 6. 779. 11 See also ad Aen. 2. 557; 2. 683; 3. 96; 2. 486; 6. 612; 6. 621; 10. 800; 11. 642. 12 Cf. ad Aen. 7. 630; 11. 603. 13 So in the notes ad Aen. 1. 287; 3. 158; and 6. 790. 14 Consider the manner of expression in ad Aen. 1. 78: Rediit ad physicam rationem. 15 The commentator has no qualms about as- signing to a divinity a physical realm which he elsewhere gives to a completely different god or goddess. His apparent rule is to follow expedi- ency; i.e., to make the association which the particular Vergilian context allows. 16 This identification Servius tries to prove by etymology, the name Vulcan (- Volicanus) be- ing derived from volare (ad Aen. 8. 414). Other notes in which etymology serves as a proof or support for allegorical interpretation are: ad Aen. 1. 47; 1. 312; 1. 388; 3. 104; 4. 130; 6. 439; 6. 265; 6. 287; 6. 295; 6. 395; 8. 297; 8. 190. Etymo- logical demonstration was, of course, always one of the chief devices of the ancient allegorizers, The Stoics employed it ad nauseam (cf. Cornutus, Theologiae Graecae Compendium, passim).</page><page sequence="10">226 J. W. JONES, JR. 17 Richard Heinze (Virgils epische Technik, 3rd ed.[Leipzig, 1928] pp. 298-99) long ago maintained that Vergil, to a much greater extent than Homer, introduces into his poetry a type of physica ratio. 18 See J. Tate, "Plato and Allegorical Interpre- tation," CQ 23 (1929) 143. 19 Cf. ad Aen. 1. 47 and Ps.-Heraclitus, Q.H. 15, Cornutus, T.G.C. 3, 19, Cic.

De civ. dei 6. 3; 7. 2, 5. 21 For a number of theories as to what Servius means by the "great circles" and for a presenta- tion of the possible philosophic traditions under- lying his description of the universe, consult E. O. Wallace, The Notes on Philosophy in the Commentary of Servius on the Eclogues, the Georgics, and the Aeneid of Vergil (New York, 1938) pp. 87-101. 22 Ad Aen. 6. 136; 6. 295; 6. 477. 23 See Wallace (above, note 21). 24 Ad Aen. 3. 359; 5. 824; 8. 319; 10. 551; 10. 558. 25 Cf. ad Aen. 1. 52; 5. 824. 26 A favorite Servian procedure is to follow an allusion to or recapitulation of a mythological story with a euhemeristic rationalization intro- duced by secundum veritatem (e.g., ad Aen. 5. 864), re vera (e.g., ad Aen. 3. 14) and the like. Palaephatus outlines his euhemeristic position in the proem to his De Incredibilibus (ed. N. Festa in Mythographi Graeci, III. 2 [Teubner, 19021). The attitude of Polybius is recorded by Strabo (1. 2. 9). 27 Elsewhere (ad G. 3. 115) Servius offers a purely euhemeristic account of the Centaurs. 28 Cf. ad Aen. 1. 741 and Diod. Sic. 3. 60. 1-3; ad Aen. 4. 484 and Diod. Sic. 4. 26. 1-4 and 4. 27. 1-2. 29 Ad Aen. 3. 578; 6. 14. 30 Sat. 3. 2. 7: Est profundam scientiam huius poetae in uno saepe reperire verbo, quod fortuito dictum vulgus putaret. 31 In one instance, the writer, in effect, defines his approach as allegorical (ad Aen. 10. 419): Multis experimentis ostenditur Vergilium sub- tiliter et aliud agentem ritum vetustzssimorum sacrorum referre .. . 32 See above, note 7. 33 E. K. Rand in CQ 10 (1916) 158-64 ("Is Dona- tus's Commentary on Vergil Lost?") advanced the theory that the scholia in question preserve the very words of Donatus. A. H. Travis ("Dona- tus and the Scholia Danielis: A Stylistic Com- parison," HSCPh 53 [1942] 157-69) found a general dissimilarity between the "philological" style of these scholia and that of Donatus' commentary on Terence. To the extent that the latter work preserves, in its mutilated state, the style of Donatus, Travis' study seems to establish a pre- sumption in favor of indirect derivation of the scholia of Daniel from the earlier commentator. 34 Thilo (above, note 7) Praef. LXXV. 35 From Macrobius (Sat. 1. 2. 15) we learn only that Servius was iuxta doctrina mirabilis et amabilis verecundia. 36 In his great work Servius always remains coldly impersonal.
