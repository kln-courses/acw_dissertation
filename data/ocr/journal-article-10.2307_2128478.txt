It is often said that general books in a field are ten years behind research. It is clearly true that most texts in intemational politics are indeed slow-if not ten years slow-in incorporating the latest findings of a rapidly expanding area of scholarship. Professor Scott sets out to overcome this deficiency. His book provides a new way of looking at international politics, a way that can help the reader inte- grate diverse data and approaches to a complex subject. Not content to remold older approaches which focus on one explanatory variable such as power or equilibrium, Scott employs a "systems outlook" as the ordering device for his analysis. Within this framework he or- ganizes the insights and findings of the newer generation of inter- national-relations scholars. Scott begins with an analysis of significant changes in the struc- ture and processes of international relationships during this century. He provides a "map" of the political world which is more impressive than those found in books where the world is depicted as a set of sovereign billiard balls, perpetually bouncing, balancing, and un. balancing. Succeeding chapters develop the systems framework, start- ing with formal definitions and followed by analyses covering dif- ferent types of action and processes within national and international systems. The author jumps from examination of processes within political units (foreign policy analysis), to analysis of processes be- tween actors, and back again. Thus, chapters 4, 6, and 8 examine images and values in policy-making, decision-making processes, and the definition of political interests, while the interspersed chapters focus on international processes and relationships such as communi- cation, conflict and collaboration, deterrence, and bargaining. Scott nevertheless does a creditable job of integrating different findings and insights of the technical literature into a meaningful framework and presents his hypotheses and formulations in concise statements. The chapters on conflict, bargaining, and deterrence are especially fine in this regard. Some readers may rebel at the format Scott uses-a series of propositions, most of which are logically or empirically linked. Those who decry the lack of literary talent in the field will undoubtedly find ammunition for their arguments in this book. The author's retort is that precision, understanding, and integration of knowledge are</page><page sequence="2">1968] BooK REvIEws 587 serv-ed best by making assumptions explicit and by logically estab- lishing relationships that otherwise may remain buried beneath elo- quent writing. Scott's book is important because it reflects both the weaknesses and the strengths of the field of international politics today. What emerges is description rather than explanation. Scott's propositions, with some notable exceptions, answer primarily how questions rather then why questions. In some cases, relationships between variables are not clear, particularly in the causal sense. And, despite the appli- cation of scientific techniques to problems in the field, the book reveals how little we can say with confidence. As the author states, many propositions have not been verified; most are based on personal judgment; almost all include tendency statements rather than proven relationships. But these points suggest the limitations of scientific method in the field more than criticism of the author. Scott may be criticized for overemphasizing processes at the expense of the "stuff" of international politics. "Actors," communica- tion, decision-making, images, and bargaining are important but do not tell us much about the sources of, and the passions aroused by., international conflicts. What the field needs-and what Scott might have included-is a discussion of types of actor interests and why (not just how) these are pursued. Without a thorough analysis of types of issues and how national and international systems operate around these, the scholar's view of international politics may seem too abstract and irrelevant to the average student. Scott's effort, however, does come off well. It reflects increasing concern with systematic thought and the need for evidence to but- tress propositions-even common-sense propositions. His book seeks to integrate knowledge where fragmentation is the rule. He does not carry the systems approach so far as to produce irrelevant abstrac- tions. He rejects the anthropomorphism of most systems analysis; to him, systems analysis is an "outlook," a way of looking at reality, not a mechanical gimmick. Scott's major contribution may well be, however, to help up locate the kinds of questions and areas of inquiry that still need research. No book sets forth better our areas of knowl- edge-and ignorance-of the subject. K. J. HOLSTI University of British Columbia</page></plain_text>
