MANNING Department of Classics, University of Reading, Whiteknights PO Box 218, Reading RG6 2AA, U.K. The Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age transformation on Cyprus (mid-later 3rd millennium B.C.E.) documents an important stage of social, economic and political development on the island. Many explanations have been offered for this transforma- tion, most based around external intervention or stimulus. However, this paper argues that the potential offered by the external world only became relevant to Cyprus because of, and in the context of, internal developments within Cypriot soci- ety. It is suggested that competition among emergent elites on Cyprus, expressed inter alia through competition for prestige and distinction, led to an interest in the external world. This initial contact in turn prompted further rapid changes driven from within Cypriot society, since knowledge of the external world both offered and forced new defiinitions of power upon Cypriot society. INTRODUCTION his article aims to develop an explanation for the emergence of complex society on Cyprus in the mid to late third millennium B.C.E. However, this is also as much an article about someone coming to know the archaeological evidence produced to date from prehistoric Cy- prus, about the search to claim knowledge of the human subjects, while overtly and covertly impos- ing process and framework upon their material produce. It is in truth more about questions than answers, about anatomy and the naming of parts, than the whole. An article that began as a rapidly written ASOR meetings abstract promising magis- terial reviews of things like settlement and trade, integrated into a broad interpretative framework (and all in 20 minutes), is instead manifest here as a discussion of questions and problems that inter- ested and side-tracked me as I perused the litera- ture. But from small things . . . At the same time, the text you read, like all explorations or journeys, is structured by the motivation for the venture, by the overarching id. In particular, I felt most writing to date on the development of social complexity in prehistoric Cyprus to be overly economic and for- malist in orientation. I thus set out seeking to structure an argument in explicitly social terms. Further, several recent articles argued that exter- nal demand for Cypriot copper prompted the devel- opment of aspects of social complexity on Cyprus in the third-second millennia B.C.E. That argument made me uneasy. There cannot have been an exter- nal knowledge and interest in Cypriot copper until the inhabitants of Cyprus had first found an interest in their local copper reserves, and had begun to develop, and so advertise, them. Sophisticated and knowledgeable external demand therefore appeared as a subsequent process after the prior, real, initial developments on Cyprus. Further, external demand only followed Cyprus' integration into a wider east- ern Mediterranean trading system; hence the cause of that integration appeared to hold the true key. Moreover, since Cyprus before the mid-late third millennium B.C.E. exhibits very little evidence of contact or integration with surrounding areas, we may presume that the outside world had little or no knowledge of or interest in Cyprus and its resources. Thus the integration of Cyprus into the eastern Mediterranean "world system" must have 35</page><page sequence="2">36 STURT W.

The ASOR Meetings abstract thus identified the underlying issue as explanation. Additional sub- themes were whether or not there are causes and prime-movers of social, economic, and political change and development, and whether such change and development is best characterized as part of a continuous long-term process, or the result of shorter term discontinuous events and circum- stances (for the last, see Trigger 1980: 175 and refs.; Cherry 1983; Spencer 1990). But this is not an honest reflection on composition, where an original glimmer is submerged in the intermittent episodes of writing, before being retrospectively reimposed upon the text. CHRONOLOGY AND SETTLEMENT A relative and absolute chronology of the period from the fourth to second millennium B.C.E. is now available from Cyprus (fig. 1; Manning and Swiny, n.d.). The ceramic-technological phases of Late Chalcolithic, Philia culture, Early Cypriot (EC), and Middle Cypriot (MC) appear to follow each other in neat order. Of course, the Philia culture overlaps with the close of the Late Chalcolithic (and perhaps the earlier Early Cypriot), and the Early Cypriot is mainly known only from tombs now inaccessible on the north coast of the island; but the general trend of evolution seems apparent. Some low degree of social complexity and social differentiation appears in the Middle Chalcolithic, becomes dramatically more apparent in the Philia culture and the Early Cypriot period, reaches its full potential in the Middle Cypriot (especially at Lapithos [Herscher 1978]), and has developed into polities or something similar by the Late Cypriot period. In that context, long-term processual hy- potheses have been presented in which a relatively static Chalcolithic world is brought up to speed through the stimulus of foreign contact, the intro- duction of the secondary products revolution, and the development of and demand for copper metal- lurgy (Knapp 1990: esp. 161; 1993a). However, even within the universe of thought involved in such work, questions arise. In particular: why were the innovations and developments of the Philia- Early Cypriot "emergence" manifest at that mo- ment, and not at some other moments, since each of the individual constituents would seem to have been available or viable for some time (compare</page><page sequence="3">1993 PRESTIGE, DISTINCTION, AND COMPETITION 37 Calendar Probability (by 20 year increments, total probability under curve = 1.0) 0.06- 0.05- 0.04- 0.03- 0.02- 0.01 0.00 -2800 -2600 -2400 -2200 -2000 -1800 -1600 Calendar Date B.C.E.

Peltenburg 1991a: 33, n. 7; Peltenburg, quoted in Knapp 1990: 165-66); and what happened in the later Middle Cypriot before the "emergence" of Late Bronze Age urbanization-did the process nearly stall? If one then steps outside the world of processual archaeology, additional questions and concerns ap- pear. In contrast to an economically driven socio- political model of diachronic process, one starts to read disquieting references to things like: "the 'demise' of southwestern sites at the transition to the Prehistoric Bronze Age" (Knapp 1990: 160; Peltenburg 1982: 84, 91, 98-100; 1990: 18-19), or, despite the use of the word "transition" again, the remarkable changes in the "transition" to the Early Bronze Age when "we are confronted by radically new settlement patterns and architecture, new burial customs, pottery styles, metalwork, and spindle whorls: in other words, virtually a com- pletely new material culture and clear evidence for an altered economy and a new religious ex- pression" (Peltenburg 1990: 16). What is going on? Is this just old fashioned culture-historical ar- chaeology, always on the lookout for destructions or migrations, or is it important? How do these observations mesh with long-term process, where "[T]he inertia of the Sotira and Erimi cultures ... began to dissipate at the end of the Early Prehis- toric period" (Knapp 1990: 161). Do "dissipate" and "transition" refer to the same circumstances as "demise," "radically," and "completely new"? Some further information has been provided by recent work. The new radiocarbon dates from Sotira Kaminoudhia (fig. 2; Manning and Swiny n.d.) at least fill the vacuum left by the previously disap- pearing Early Bronze Age of the south and west of Cyprus (Herscher 1980; 1981). The site also brings a small area of Middle-Late Chalcolithic sherdage and some transitional circular to rectilinear architec- ture into close spatial association with a few Philia- culture tombs and an Early Cypriot settlement (Swiny 1985a;. 1985b; 1986; 1991; Wright 1992: 69, 226-27). More recently, the excavations at Kis- sonerga Mosphilia offer in the last phases of occu- pation an example of Philia material appearing alongside the previous Chalcolithic assemblage, and coexisting with it (Peltenburg 1991a: 30-31). To this one might add fragmentary evidence from older work, such as from the small soundings by Dikaios in the Ovgos Valley. Two sites, Philia Drakos B and Kyra Alonia/Kaminia, appeared to show some asso- ciation between Late Chalcolithic settlements and a</page><page sequence="4">38 STURT W. MANNING BASOR 292 Philia culture cemetery (Dikaios 1962: 150, 152- 59); and, at the latter settlement, where Late Chal- colithic to Red Polished pottery was found, there was evidence of continuity through that period. However, in general, such evidence of continuity and transition remains more notable for its rarity or ambiguity, especially after the period of the late Chalcolithic-Philia culture overlap. The lack of clear evidence led to the debate between Dikaios (1962: 192-203) and Stewart (1962: 282-85) concerning whether the Philia culture completely preceded the Early Cypriot or was a regional variant and contem- porary with it.1 The crux of the debate is that al- though several cemeteries contain both Philia culture and Early Cypriot tombs (e.g., Nicosia Ayia Paras- kevi, Dhenia Kafkalla, Marki Tavari, Sotira Kami- noudhia), there is no good evidence for the nature of the relationship between the two assemblages. Two tombs (nos. 12 and 14A) at Ayia Paraskevi have been held to show that the Philia culture and Early Cypriot assemblages coexisted (Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg 1988: 19-20, 21-22, 40-41), but the evi- dence is very weak. Tomb 12 may have two Philia ceramic items (although the bowl is not particularly diagnostic), however, the claimed Early Cypriot link is not supplied by diagnostic pottery, but merely by one Early Cypriot type (button terminal, hook- tanged) spearhead (called a "dagger" by Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg 1988). The assemblage said to come from Tomb 14A certainly does have both di- agnostic Philia and Early Cypriot ceramic material, but there is no evidence that they belong to the same burials. The deposits had been disturbed, and were not well defined; the field notebooks from the ex- cavation have been lost.2 Stewart (1962: 269-70, 296-97) also argued for the temporal and spatial overlap of the Philia culture and Early Cypriot assemblages on the basis of his claims of Philia cul- ture material in the Early Cypriot tombs at Bellapais Vounous. But subsequent studies have revealed no diagnostic Philia culture material from the Vounous tombs. Indeed, no published or reported excavation to date of a secure, nondisturbed, tomb or settlement context provides evidence of the contemporary asso- ciation of Philia culture and Early Cypriot material. A good example comes from the large cemetery of Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba (Herscher 1975; 1978). This extensively excavated site is a mere 4.5 km east of tombs with Philia culture material at Vasilia Kaphkalla (Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg 1988: 25-39), but has yielded no Philia culture material. The earliest material at Vrysi tou Barba is early Early Cypriot. On the other hand, some forms of relationship may be noted or guessed at between the two assem- blages. Several vessel types at Vounous do reveal similarities to, or influence from, Philia culture types (e.g., jugs with cutaway spouts, deep spouted bowls, incised bottles and jars). Thus some form of sequential relationship may be inferred. It certainly need not be unilinear, with one discreet period fol- lowing another. A fashion in one area may have influenced contemporary fashion in another area. We can also consider the nature of the Philia culture material in terms of its own apparent stylis- tic evolution. In southwest Cyprus, early Philia culture material occurs with local Late Chalcolithic material at Kissonerga Mosphilia; subsequently, late Philia culture material occurs in tombs at a cemetery at Sotira Kaminoudhia otherwise dated to the Early Cypriot period. The Philia culture thus appears to begin and overlap with southwest Late Chalcolithic, and end by or just within the early Early Cypriot period. In the north of Cyprus the situation is a little more complicated. At Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi in northern Cyprus (and Dhenia Kafkalla and Marki Tavari), there are several early Philia culture tombs in cemeteries with other Early Cypriot (and later) tombs. Two lines of interpretation seem possible. Ac- cording to the first, the early Philia tombs are dis- tinct and earlier than the Early Cypriot tombs, and the late Philia culture phase is either absent in a "gap" between the two assemblages, or not repre- sented, but occurring at the same time as earlier Early Cypriot. The second line of interpretation involves fur- ther pursuit of the chronology of the Philia style. At Ayia Paraskevi there are early Philia culture tombs, with Black Slip and Combed (Philia) ware and/or White Painted IA (Philia) ware pottery (e.g., Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg 1988: Tomb 9; White Painted IA only in Tombs 3, 3A, and 4). These have no Early Cypriot associations, and may be supposed to predate the Early Cypriot styles. Two graves (only one with any clarity) with respectively mature and early-mature Philia culture ceramics (Tombs 12 and 14A) then have possible associations with fairly early Early Cypriot pottery (Red Polished I, I-II, II). If one dismisses this evi- dence of overlap on the grounds of the poor data, then early-mature Philia may predate subsequent early Early Cypriot. Alternatively, if one follows the implications of Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehr- berg (1988), despite the poor records, we might consider the mature Philia culture as overlapping</page><page sequence="5">1993 PRESTIGE, DISTINCTION, AND COMPETITION 39 with early Early Cypriot. The absence of Philia culture artifacts in any later Early Cypriot context shows that the overlap did not continue beyond early Early Cypriot. The early Early Cypriot styles, particularly associated with the north-coast area, might then be seen as originating out of the influ- ence of the earlier-mature Philia style. They then coexist in the mature-late Philia culture period as a new, discreet, rival, fashion. Study of metal arti- facts supports a similar view (Philip 1991: 73-75). Thus, while a new early Early Cypriot fashion takes over some areas, like the north coast as rep- resented at Vounous Cemetery A, and completely replaces whatever the earlier tradition was in those areas, later Philia fashion remains in use in some other areas of Cyprus. In places outside the "core" new early Early Cypriot areas, one might expect evidence of contact or exchange between these two fashions groupings. Hence the new early Early Cypriot fashion and assemblage appears in an earlier-mature Philia culture context in one or two tombs in the Mesaoria (Ayia Paraskevi Tombs 12 and 14A) as a new, imported or imitated, prestige style, but not the reverse (i.e., no Philia culture ar- tifacts in early Early Cypriot contexts), since the Philia culture was yesterday's news in such places (hence no Philia culture material was found at Vounous and Vrysi tou Barba). However, despite such musing, the main con- clusion is that the Chalcolithic-Philia/Early Cyp- riot transition remains largely undocumented. A significant break or transformation is the most ap- parent feature between the Chalcolithic and the Early Cypriot. The Philia culture seems to hold the key, but, as we have seen, is itself poorly known and defined. The situation is not helped by the fact that no site unequivocally offers a stratigraphic se- quence from the Late Chalcolithic to the Early Cypriot. Most previous claims for Chalcolithic- Philia/Early Cypriot continuity have been rejected (e.g., Ambelikou Ayios Georghios [Peltenburg 1991b]). Moreover, the few sites in question do not survive the "transition" if that is what it was (also perhaps Kalavasos Arkhangelos, Vasilia Loukkos Trakhonas, Kyra Alonia/Kaminia). In general, it is difficult to review current evidence without being struck by the lack of continuity between the Chal- colithic and Early Cypriot periods (Peltenburg 1990: 18-19; although cf. Peltenburg 1982: 91- 98)-certainly in the south and west of the island where research has perforce concentrated in the last two decades. There are plentiful Chalcolithic sites in Cyprus, but only a few Philia culture or Early Cypriot settlement loci; and, with a very few exceptions, Philia and Early Cypriot sites repre- sent a reorientation from the previous Chalcolithic settlement pattern. As Peltenburg (1982: 98-99) writes: " . . but this is not to underestimate the significance of changes. The absence of readily located Early Bronze Age settlements is striking and.., .implies a modification of settlement type and perhaps settlement pattern." A good example is offered by the Vasilikos Valley, where there are several Chalcolithic sites, but an absence of any clear Early Bronze Age site (Todd 1991: 12, 15, fig. 8).3 The pattern, in the south and west, of a number of Chalcolithic sites that end in the Late Chalcolithic with no evidence of later occupation is another frequently cited example. The cluster of major Chalcolithic sites around Kissonerga and Lemba, and the absence of similar succeeding Early Cypriot sites, offer an instance of this fact, although one possible Early Cypriot site is known near Kissonerga Mosphilia at Kissonerga Ammoun- dhia.4 The change and contrasts in the material culture between the Chalcolithic and Philia-Early Cypriot periods are, of course, manifest and well known. Such evidence of dislocation and "destructions" (as at the close of Lemba Lakkous 3 and Kisson- erga Mosphilia 4), does not blend easily with a continuous process model. The lack of Early Pre- historic settlement in the major river valleys of the southwest and southeast, in marked contrast to the Chalcolithic, can at best be dismissed by the fee- ble suggestion that the pattern "need indicate only that... [the] ... population had not increased to the extent that more land was required" (Knapp 1990: 158). The real question is why were major productive areas of the previous millennium or so abandoned in the Early Bronze Age? On a broader scale, one must also consider how the specifics of the Late Chalcolithic "demise" in Cyprus might be linked to similar evidence for collapse and reorien- tation in the Aegean, in Anatolia, and in Syria- Palestine from about the same time (e.g., Forsen 1992; Doumas 1988; Mellaart 1958; Richard 1987; Wiess et al. 1993a; 1993b: 999-1002). There are other problems for the continuous process model. It predicts and claims to see an "increase in site size" (Knapp 1990: 158) across the Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age period, yet pro- vides little evidence to support the assertion, with the sizes of the larger Early Cypriot sites simply unknown and the sizes of even Middle Cypriot sites only about the same size, and certainly the same</page><page sequence="6">40 STURT W.

Note: basis and quality of estimates vary. general magnitude, as the larger Chalcolithic sites (fig. 3; Knapp 1990: Table 2; Swiny 1981).5 Swiny (1989: 16) does indeed state the opposite: "Some settlements such as Kissonerga-Mosphilia ... or Erimi-Pamboula... .have artifact scatters of be- tween 12 and 15 ha, but in size.., .they do not compare with EC and especially MC sites, some of which cover 35 ha." However, there is no solid evi- dence with regard to the larger Early Cypriot sites, and the one large Middle Cypriot site to which he alludes, Alambra Mouttes, is given a conservative maximum extent of habitation of only ca. 10-15 ha by the excavator (Coleman 1985: 130). We may also note that this large settlement is short lived. Rupp (1987: 220) reports another Middle Cypriot site of 34 ha, but only from artifact scatter, and with no indication of whether the site may be late Middle Cypriot(-Late Cypriot I) when the settle- ment hierarchy does change significantly. More- over, some overall increase in site size by the Middle Cypriot, some 600-1,000 or so years after the Chalcolithic data, might be expected simply due to the effects of population growth-fueled by the personnel and social needs of small-scale sed- entary societies engaged in normal surplus sub- sistence production (Bender 1978; Friedman and Rowlands 1977; Halstead 1989)-in an otherwise neutral environment (even at a very low annual rate). The issue is the lack of a change of magni- tude of scale over this substantial time span,6 and the repeated cycles of shifting, sequential, settle- ment hierarchy and collapse. This is not to suggest that there are not obvious qualitative changes be- tween the respective societies (below). Each epi- sode represents a change in magnitude of the type of society (Chalcolithic versus Early Cypriot, etc.). But each episode was discreet. Thus evidence for long-term evolutionary trajec- tories is at best deficient, or at least not of a contin- uous form. Nor are the locations of any of the larger sites in the respective periods the same. There is no focal locus across this fourth to second millennium B.C.E. era in Cyprus (from current research). Instead there are Chalcolithic clusters, then differing Early Prehistoric clusters, and, it might be argued, differ- ent Late Bronze Age foci, when power seems to shift again, away from the north coast, to sites on the east and south coasts and in the Morphou re- gion. Until the dramatic transformation of Cyprus into a set of urban polities in the Late Bronze Age (Knapp 1986a; 1986b; Negbi 1986), Cyprus might be characterized as a village-based society with epi- sodes of larger sites (or agglomerations), which then cease, followed later by another episode, and so on. Within periods, the episodes seem merely to oscil- late between the beginnings of emergent complex- ity, then collapse, and then reorientation. That is the pattern at the few long-lived sites, such as Chal-</page><page sequence="7">1993 PRESTIGE, DISTINCTION, AND COMPETITION 41 Scale of Social Complexity Boundary conditions/ - Step model I II Early Cypriot Late Cypriot Chalcolithic Middle Cypriot Calendar Time Fig. 4. Suggested step model of social development. colithic Kissonerga Mosphilia, where an episode of development of emergent complexity in one period is followed by collapse or a hiatus, and then another episode, and so on (Peltenburg 1991a). Here either the conditions and requirements for institutionalized stratification were not sufficient (or suitably circum- scribed), or the forces of resistance to social in- equality were not successfully overcome. However, something else also occurs between periods. Al- though the period episodes appear separate and dis- creet, and often largely of the same overall scale, marked qualitative changes are apparent between periods (see below on Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age divide). Thus between the longer episodes of period oscillation, a threshold has been rapidly passed in some form of quantum leap that suddenly overcame previous boundary conditions. Figure 4 presents a sketch of such a model. It could be char- acterized as a "step" model. Is this model correct for Cyprus? The brief evi- dence alluded to here is not really sufficient to judge; and, arguably, there is insufficient suitable data yet available to make a categorical decision. However, it does fit many previous observations on settlement and social development in prehis- toric Cyprus, and may be borne in mind as we con- sider some of the social and economic parameters, and then the question of the Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age "transition." MAGNITUDE OF THE SOCIAL DIMENSION What was the scale of prehistoric society on Cy- prus? The majority of sites appear to have been small. Peltenburg (1991a: 17) suggests that most Chalcolithic sites "hardly attain 3 ha," and Early Cypriot sites appear little different, with Sotira Ka- minoudhia perhaps typical at about 2 ha (Swiny 1981: 65, 79). It would appear natural to turn for confirmation to the archaeological survey data pub- lished to date, but those data offer problematic evi- dence concerning site size, especially for the larger sites. The major surveys, in the Palaipaphos by Rupp et al. (1984) and in the Vasilikos Valley by Todd (1991: 12-13), usually do not offer site size estimates based on careful measurement and sys- tematic gridding and intensive recording of sites (but cf., Rupp et al. 1992). Thus round figure data, e.g., of 400 x 250 m and so on, for some Middle Cypriot sites, often with earlier or later compo- nents, and with no further information on distribu- tion, density, or periodization, are not satisfactory. Even so, and although coverage of the island is limited, and quoted site areas are frequently for multiperiod scatters, surveys on Cyprus usually suggest a majority of small sites, with larger Chal- colithic, Early Cypriot and Middle Cypriot artifact scatters only rarely greater than 5-10 ha (e.g., Frankel and Webb, in press; Rupp et al. 1984;</page><page sequence="8">42 STURT W. MANNING BASOR 292 Rupp et al. 1992; Rupp 1987; Baird 1987; Todd 1988; Stanley-Price 1979; Swiny 1981; Held 1989; Manning and Conwell 1992). In the absence of total settlement excavation, and attempts at detailed microspatial and house- hold reconstruction from architecture and artifact assemblages (cf. social and ethnoarchaeological analyses of, e.g., Hillier and Hanson 1984; Kent 1984; Samson 1990), the estimation of the pop- ulation living at such sites will be problematic at best, since such matters defy simple uniformitarian assumptions (e.g., Fletcher 1981; Schacht 1981; Whitelaw 1983a; 1983b). In some cases, it also appears that only part of an overall site was in use at any one time. At Lemba, Peltenburg (1991a: 18) seems to suggest a site population of 240, on the basis of extrapolation of roofed and occupied areas. The logic is far from clear. In the exca- vated exposure, about 40 percent comprised roofed dwellings. Is this the 40 percent of the next sen- tence, or does it mean that only 40 percent of the overall 40 percent was contemporaneously occu- pied? From a total site area said to be about 3 ha (Peltenberg 1991a: 19; Peltenburg et al. 1985: 9), the respective contemporary roofed dwelling space is either 1.2 ha or 0.48 ha, depending on the above. How do we then arrive at 240? On the assumption that the latter is the working hypothesis, 20 m2 must be allowed per person. No explanation is offered. Although ethnographic parallels may be adduced, 20 m2 is double the typical cross-cultural standby assumption of about 10 m2 in the absence of other evidence (Naroll 1962; see also Whitelaw 1983a: 341-42, n. 6; Kolb 1985). We might consider two alternative methods of estimation. First, Peltenburg et al. (1985: 315) note that in Period I there were nine buildings in about 300 m2, or up to 130 on the site as a whole if that exposure is a representative sample. If about 40 percent were in contemporaneous use or were used as houses (see above; Peltenburg 1991a: 18; Peltenburg et al. 1985), that would mean 52 houses. On a default assumption of nuclear families typi- cally of five persons, we might estimate a popu- lation of 260. Second, we might have regard to general population-per-hectare estimates for the Near East and the Aegean. Such estimates have varied widely, and, as Kramer (1980; 1982: 155-68), and Aurenche (1981) argue, have probably tended to be too high in most of the older literature. The high apparent densities found in imperial Mesopotamia by some calcula- tions, or in recent old Baghdad, Aleppo, Damascus, or San'a', are probably not relevant to the earlier prehistoric periods, ca. 200-400+ persons per hect- are (Hassan 1981: 66, with refs.; Serjeant and Lew- cock 1983: 109-12). In addition, in most cases dealing with long-lived settlement sites, one cannot assume all the area of the archaeological site was either contemporary, or in use, nor that all built area comprised habitation space. Adams, for ex- ample, recognizing those and other factors, has thus lowered his original estimate of 200 persons per hectare for sites in Mesopotamia (1965: 123): first to ca. 100 persons per hectare (Adams and Nissen 1972: 29-30), and more recently to ca. 125 persons per hectare (Adams 1981: 69, 143-44, 349, n. 6, 350, n. 1). Renfrew's (1972: 251) 200 persons per hectare in the Aegean, derived from the Near East- ern studies, might be similarly lowered. On the basis of comparative ethnography in southwest Asia, Au- renche (1981) suggests population densities around or less than 100 persons per hectare in Neolithic vil- lages, and Kramer (1980; 1982: 155-68) reaches a similar conclusion of typical values of 100-150 per- sons per hectare for the ancient Near East. Sumner, while rightly warning against any uniformitarian as- sumptions and stressing the possible range of popu- lation densities (Sumner 1979), recently suggests that a figure of 160 persons per hectare is a reason- able "average" (Sumner 1989). On the basis of such estimates, the population of Lemba might be esti- mated as in the range of 300-480. But that range in fact contains several dubious assumptions; in par- ticular, that the 3 ha of Lemba were all relatively densely settled. Thus it is very much a maximum range (given the choice of an appropriate average of persons per hectare in a dense urban context). We should thus consider the alternative: the likely minimum population. To approach this, we might examine ethnographic data from recent traditional Cyprus. Relatively low density occupation sup- ported by extensive and nonintensive agriculture was the norm in villages (as in the Aegean: see Hal- stead 1987). Swiny (1981: 78-79) provides some data that yield figures of 35-50 persons per hectare for such villages. Thus a minimum population for Lemba, for example, might be estimated at 105-150 persons. The real population probably lay between 105/150 and 300/480 persons. Most other Cypriot prehistoric sites would have had similar or smaller populations. Sherd and de- bris scatters often tend to be considerably larger than the original area of the settlement-due both to human actions during the lifetime of the settle- ment and to subsequent erosion and so on-so</page><page sequence="9">1993 PRESTIGE, DISTINCTION, AND COMPETITION 43 many sites with supposed areas from surface scat- ters up to 5-6 ha. (especially where they have not been systematically nor intensively studied) may well represent villages of only 1-2 ha of con- temporaneous structures. The majority of Cypriot prehistoric villages may thus be assumed to have had populations of less than 400-500. That is as expected. Such prehistoric Cypriot villages show only limited evidence of social complexity, and fit naturally into the category of small village with only limited development of hierarchy, and a vari- ety of other low-level social mechanisms, which seem to exist the world over with populations of up to about 500 people (see, e.g., Naroll 1956; Car- neiro 1967; Flannery 1972; Forge 1972; Dumond 1972; Johnson 1982; 1983; Lee 1986; Kosse 1990; Upham 1990b: 100-101). Our attention is therefore drawn to the few significantly larger Chalcolithic and Early Cyp- riot-Middle Cypriot sites (12-15 ha+). There is no evidence that those sites were not relatively densely inhabited. Some, like Alambra Mouttes, were short-lived and must represent largely con- temporary habitation. Other long-lived settlements, like Kissonerga Mosphilia, might be reduced by some factor for noncontemporary residences (say the 40 percent used above). However, any form of analysis would still have to suggest populations of around 500-1,000, and probably around 1,000- 2,000, people for any of the sites. The sites clearly have broken through the threshold of the small village. In most cases the change also requires the development of a more complex, central or hierar- chical, social organization.7 Some evidence from Mosphilia indeed appears to support such views of the likelihood of new or more complex social de- velopments. Support comes from the evidence of some buildings of notable size (and differentiated structures in general), evidence for the develop- ment of bulk storage vessels (pithoi), and evidence of some form of organized religious activity (Peltenburg 1991a: 22-27; 1991d). Compared to the relative ease of the creation of the mildly hierarchical small village, this next step appears to occur relatively rarely in human history as a whole, and so must be assumed to involve cre- ating, overcoming, or balancing, considerable resis- tance (see Upham 1990a; note also the ca. 1.0-1.5 ha site size barrier category of Fletcher 1986). Among possible alternatives, fission is perhaps the most likely response to such scalar and social stress, unless denied by some form of social or environ- mental circumscription. SUBSISTENCE AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION The slow and intermittent progress of emergent complexity in Cyprus until the Late Bronze Age suggests that resistance often won out in the long run. One reason is that no environmental or geo- graphical factors appear decisive in Cyprus. For ex- ample, there are limited water resources, but they are still available in several areas. Geography favors a few, but discreet areas. The social dynamic also ap- pears to lack the necessary ingredients. Chalcolithic society does not appear to have gone beyond the small-scale agricultural model, where subsistence, social reproduction on a household and village level, and ancestry, are the central and related foci. There is no indication that any person or group was able to make itself the key focus of society, and the source or intermediaries of the ultimate sanction within the society-even at the exceptionally large site of Kis- sonerga Mosphilia. Instead, ideology seems to con- centrate around the house, and figurines-usually of women and often giving birth (Goring 1991a; 1991b; Peltenburg 1989: 113-22; 1991d)-and sec- ondary burial practices (Niklasson 1991). The former two imply the precedence of the domus (Hodder 1990), and some sort of earth-mother power, rather than any secular power or intermediary, with humans generally acting as husbands who care for and inseminate a maternal figure, and in return reap life and harvests. The latter suggests the role of cemeteries and ancestry in establishing rights and ownership, and the importance of ancestors as inter- mediaries between the living and the supernatural. The increasing attention to juvenile burials in the Chalcolithic, and the multiple burials at Souskiou (Christou 1989), would suggest the development of lineages, and the diachronic possession of rights and status. However, there is no single secular-sacred focus, and no basis for institutionalized power whereby existing differentials, such as the status of kin lineages, becomes of such central competitive importance as to become capable of leading to legit- imation of permanent rule. The Chalcolithic economy of Cyprus was perhaps also incapable, as constituted, of supporting further complexity in the given environment and with the package of farming resources available. For exam- ple, in his discussion of possible acreages of cereals at Lemba on the basis of the Period 2 store area, Peltenburg refers to the figures for cereal yields from traditional Cyprus (Peltenburg et al. 1985: 326). The implicit assumptions may be questioned. Traditional Cypriot agriculture was based around extensive</page><page sequence="10">44 STURT W. MANNING BASOR 292 plow agriculture. But Chalcolithic Cyprus had no plows, nor cattle or equids.8 A form of agricultural regime based on intensive human labor versus ex- tensive animal labor might be envisaged instead (as Halstead 1981; 1987 argued for the Neolithic, and some later periods and areas, of Greece). Despite the high yields per unit area under intensive cultivation, considerations of time and transportation limit such an economy. A population of 1,000-2,000 people would require some 650-1300 ha per annum, and double if one allows for grazing or fallow areas (employing yield and consumption data in Gallant [1991] for Greece). That is all land within about 2- 3 km of a site, or all land within about one hour's walk when carrying a burden. But not all such land will be suitable, and the distances become uneco- nomic given the ability to supply the necessary labor at perhaps 150-200 man days per hectare (on the basis of traditional vegetable or pulse cultivation [Gallant 1991: 76]), and to transport the harvest. In particular, it is necessary to have good water sup- plies, and to be present to protect one's garden from pests and scavengers. For those reasons, a number of the northern Greek Neolithic settlements in fact ap- pear to have practiced a form of dispersed settle- ment, with houses at a site spaced apart with gardens in between. However, there is no evidence for such dispersed settlement in the Chalcolithic at sites like Lemba and Kissonerga. Hence, on the assumption of nucleated settlement, the costs involved in subsis- tence thus become higher and higher as the settle- ment population grows (compare also Gamble 1982). The combination of such escalating economic costs and stresses, along with the tensions created among any large concentration of population, lead to two alternatives: some form of managerial special- ization, or fission (e.g., Johnson 1973; 1982). Unless there are other strong factors, incentives or con- straints to the contrary, fission is the easiest choice. Peltenburg (1991a: 27) notes in that regard that in Chalcolithic Cyprus the "relative sparsity [of settle- ments] meant that additional territory was available for occupation by disaffected groups, and that the opportunity for competition among interacting peer groups was limited." Chalcolithic development per- haps had a rudimentary socioeconomic ceiling in the absence of special constraints. THE SECONDARY PRODUCTS REVOLUTION AND SOCIAL CONTEXT The limitations inherent in the Chalcolithic economy all changed in the next periods with the introduction of plow agriculture (Knapp 1990). That created the possibility both of a much greater agricultural surplus in terms of invested labor, and of its mobilization. In retrospect, we can tick off the beginning of a new episode of socioeconomic complexity on Cyprus. But the real question is why this development occurred suddenly with the Philia-Early Cypriot period? After all, the second- ary products revolution and associated technolo- gies had been available in neighboring lands for many centuries. Cypriot society had, however, remained insular, with only a handful of value objects (a couple of metal objects, some faience beads, some shells: Peltenburg 1991a) encroaching from outside the island. Why the change? More- over, how does the process relate to, and perhaps help explain, the demise of the Chalcolithic? For an answer, we need to look first at the changes in the next period. VALUE AND SYMBOLS: THE CHALCOLITHIC/ BRONZE AGE DIVIDE At first glance, the early Bronze Age episode of emergent complexity is not markedly different from the Chalcolithic in terms of settlement size, econ- omy, or even degree of social differentiation (i.e., merely a two-tier picture of richer and poorer buri- als). In most cases, it seems another temporary cycle, with Late Bronze Age sites in different loca- tions and with different orientations. However, whereas a long series of episodes of larger sites in Neolithic and Chalcolithic Cyprus were undoubt- edly based around things like the priority of exis- tence, and so centrality in regional social relations and reproductive universes, and strategic locations, the Philia Culture and Early Cypriot period repre- sent a new turn. A major qualitative transformation is apparent. Yes, we are largely restricted to funer- ary evidence, but even what we do have appears decisive. I note just a few well known points. Metal Artifacts. Significant numbers of a lim- ited range of metal artifacts (Stewart and Stewart 1950; Stewart 1962: 242-56; Swiny 1989: 26-27; Muhly 1991; Balthazar 1990; Philip 1991) ap- peared, many of them weapons, and they are depos- ited in selected tombs. Further, pottery imitations of those metal types occur (e.g., Tomb 114 at Vounous Cemetery A [Stewart and Stewart 1950: 152-55]), as well as non-utilitarian over-sized, or even miniature, versions (Philip 1991: 68-69, 90).</page><page sequence="11">1993 PRESTIGE, DISTINCTION, AND COMPETITION 45 A "package" is also evident of a spear or knife and a whetstone in a select suite of burials.9 Foreign Influences. The appearance of several imports and exports and general foreign influences in technology, style, and fashion has been noted (Swiny 1986; Mellink 1991; Astrim 1989; Catling and MacGillivray 1983; Branigan 1966; 1967; Gale 1991; Merrillees 1979; Rutter 1985; Knapp 1990: Table 3), along with, again, the deposition of many such objects in selected tombs. Collective Burials. The appearance, especially from later Early Cypriot, of rich collective burials used over a span of time for only a part of the population, may be contrasted either with less rich tombs, or, more particularly as at Vasilia, "a con- siderable cemetery of simple pit graves" (Swiny 1989: 26-27; Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg 1988: 25; Knapp 1990: 159). Although even the most rudimentary skeletal data are often absent, we might still make a reasonable guess that, like simi- lar tombs from later third millennium B.C.E. Crete (Soles 1992: 251-55), the select collective tombs in use over time were the burial places of the few elite families or lineages. Such evidence suggests the rise of a sustained and inheritable power. New Vessel Forms. The significant develop- ment, enlargement, refinement, or appearance of a whole new complex of portable storage, pouring, or serving vessels (especially jugs and bowls) associ- ated with some forms of liquids (see Stewart 1962; 1988; 1992). This new complex, and its association with tomb deposits, is part of a wider mid-third millennium B.C.E. process across the eastern Medi- terranean, the Aegean and Europe (Sherratt 1981; 1987). The contexts, the prominence of those arti- facts, the frequent complex stylistic decoration and signaling, and even sometimes the virtuoso, elabo- rate, nature of multipiece vessels (e.g., Stewart 1988: pl. 12), all combine to reveal their social im- portance and value, and so the social and political importance of the associated activities. We may guess that the activity was the drinking of alcoholic beverage. That is no small moment. To quote Sher- ratt (1987: 92): "The introduction of alcoholic drinks, with their properties of intoxication and the generation of conviviality-a socially accepted al- teration of consciousness-is a major event for any society .... The religious and elite overtones of wine in later European and Near Eastern societies point to its fundamental social importance, and its use in prehistoric times is likely to have been ac- companied by cult and ceremony.... The prepara- tion of alcoholic drinks required investment and the ability to concentrate surplus for conspicuous con- sumption, as did also the manufacture of appropri- ately ostentatious vessels. Such privileges may have been available only to the few." Thus the significance here is that drinking is a group activ- ity, but one that requires an elite (or similar hier- archical organization) for the production of the lubricant. It is thus both facilitated and controllable by the elite. Alcohol drinking therefore offered the means to power and to social integration in one, avoiding the usual problems of conflict or negotia- tion (cf., Mann 1986). As Sherratt (1987: 93) writes quoting Fried (1967: 178), ranked and stratified societies are particularly characterized by their frequent intercommunity activities, most no- tably feasts, parties, ceremonies and other events predicated on organized hospitality. The developed drinking complex thus displays the presence in Cy- prus of a new group mentality, and an elite, within society. Secular Holders of Power. The appearance of an institutionalized, secular, form of power concen- trated in, or expressed by, a key individual.1' This view is based on a reading of the available iconog- raphy, and in particular the model from Vounous Tomb 22 (Dikaios 1940: 118-25, 173, pls. 7, 8; Karageorghis 1976: 106; Morris 1985: 281-83; Peltenburg 1991d: 24-26, 105-7). Here a figure (male) is seated on an elaborate, raised, chair pre- siding over a complex and composite scene. The figure is the largest in the composition, and the focus of attention for an assembly. His importance and authority are evident and actively reinforced by the presence of the surrounding group of males. Moreover, although the scene is very probably reli- gious in nature (Dikaios 1940: 118-25), the status and power of the seated male do not stem solely from some temporary action or association as the celebrant of a deity. Another kneeling figure is in- stead performing a rite in front of the altar with tri- ple bucranial element on the opposite wall. The seated male is thus shown as permanent in his sta- tus; further reinforced by the positioning of the ac- tual celebrant so as to create balance between the seated male and the altar. In addition, the key sources of life, power, wealth, and social reproduc- tion are displayed around the seated figure (cattle, woman with baby and child watching her, the so- cial group, and perhaps the ancestors [a possible in- terpretation of the three relief figures with chthonic associations; see Dikaios 1940: 121-23]).</page><page sequence="12">46 STURT W. MANNING BASOR 292 In short, one may recognize an hereditary elite and all the ingredients for further development into entities like polities or states. However, to return to the question at the close of the previous section, why did this development occur here and now, and not in the Chalcolithic, and not in the west, when and where the incipient elements also appear to be present. I argue that trade is the key. It prompted the beginning of a nexus, or multiplier effect, which relatively suddenly led to a transformation in Cyprus. Trade is an unfortunate word, however. We find it difficult to divorce it from modern connotations. Trade in early prehistoric Cyprus involved two types: first, a very few imports or exports from out- side the island, and second, intraisland movement of both a few select classes of materials, such as picrolite (Peltenburg 1991c) and, although archaeo- logically invisible, other likely local or regional net- works of exchange, reciprocity, and risk-buffering in necessary utilitarian items. The latter, local trade, is not relevant here. As Peltenburg (1991c: 117; from Hastorf 1990: 152- 54) argues, intraisland, or local, trade permitted the maintenance of group relations and contacts, access to other necessary resources, and mainte- nance of the status quo. Such local trade often takes some form of gift exchange. In general, such mechanisms are noninflationary, and do not create wealth for individuals. Instead, prestige and status accrues from expenditure in the reciprocal cycle of exchanges, and the existing social system and its alliances are maintained. Local trade by itself is unlikely to lead to a transformation in social and political structures. In contrast, interregional, or long-distance, trade is concerned with either those relatively few, non- bulk, nonstaple, goods that had value and prestige for the societies in question (e.g., Helms 1979; Schort- mann and Urban 1987; Sherratt and Sherratt 1991: 353-54, 358-60), or sometimes special utilitarian materials (such as the spread of Melian obsidian in the Aegean). The acquisition and possession of value or prestige items frequently is associated with pres- tige, power, and elites. They are part of a political trade. For example, their acquisition forms an aspect of conspicuous consumption, permits the rewarding of followers, denotes resourcefulness and leadership, and generally confers status. Prestige, symbolism, and power flow from the possession and control of such items, and from the possession and control of the necessary knowledge and relations with distant places (Helms 1988). Although a very few imports may be noted from the Chalcolithic period in Cyprus, the appearance of foreign or foreign-influenced prestige goods and fashions distinguishes the Philia-Early Cypriot period. However, this is not an explanation by itself. Hastorf (1990: 154) comments that, "Prestige exchange is not linked to the onset of political rank, but to the extension of power in an already differentiated society." But, the introduction of prestige and novel items and ideas into an emer- gent society can lead to rapid social, political, and economic transformation through the extension and development of existing divisions (as in early contact Polynesia [Bargatzky 1989]). For example, as in the Philia-Early Cypriot case, there are a number of cultures where an elaboration of mortuary practices is associated with periods of competition or culture contact. The initial question is thus the explanation of the end of Cypriot isolation, and the location of the spatial and temporal context for rapid change. One could simply resort to older arguments, and posit a migration of peoples from Anatolia. But positive evidence for that explanation is lacking, and bet- ter ideas are available. Let us return to the Late Chalcolithic. Period 4 at Kissonerga Mosphilia sees the development of a large site with evidence of clear social differentiation, and-from finds such as a conical stamp seal-some form of diachronic formal ownership and administration (Peltenburg 1991a: 29). Some prestige goods appear, including copper, shell, and faience (Peltenburg 1991a: 29- 30; Gale 1991). In particular, as Peltenburg notes, these include a couple of typically Philia-culture or Early Bronze Age objects. The typically Philia- Early Cypriot chamber tomb also occurs. What was happening elsewhere on the island? The truth is, we do not really know. But a good guess may be made (Peltenburg 1991a: 31-32; Model 1; Knapp 1990: 153). The northwest of Cyprus (Ovgos Valley and the area north to the coast, between Cape Kormakiti and Bellapais) has both a greater density of Philia- Early Cypriot sites, and the majority of the most impressive assemblages of those periods. The re- gion is also the closest part of Cyprus to the appar- ent sources of the foreign influences behind several of the new styles in artifacts and associated elite fashions (e.g., drinking of alcoholic beverages). In combination with the few apparent Philia linkages with Period 4 at Kissonerga, it therefore seems likely, pending firm chronological data to the con- trary, that the Philia culture was developing in the northwest of Cyprus contemporary with the Late Chalcolithic (Erimi) culture elsewhere. If this chronology is correct, an explanatory framework becomes available. Just as large settle-</page><page sequence="13">1993 PRESTIGE, DISTINCTION, AND COMPETITION 47 ments of 1,000+ people had arisen with some social differentiation at Kissonerga and Erimi, with inter- est by some in prestige items, we must imagine one or more similar sites and episodes of emergent so- cial complexity in the fertile northwest in the Late Chalcolithic period. The emergent elite at those sites would have also been interested in acquiring pres- tige goods. By luck, and in contrast to sites in south- ern and western Cyprus, they were close to a source of such goods, exotica, and influences (southern Anatolia). Geography also would have led seaborne trade between other more advanced eastern Mediter- ranean societies of the region to voyage along the southern Cilician and north Cyprus coastal corridor, as attested by North Syrian, Minoan, and perhaps northwest Anatolian links from the Early Cypriot period. Circumstances thus permitted the emergent elite of this one area of Cyprus to have a special op- portunity. There is little evidence of Chalcolithic seafaring in Cyprus, so the initial contacts were probably reliant on outside initiative or accident. By historical circumstance, the mid-third millennium B.C.E. saw the extension of the eastern Mediterra- nean "world system" into that very region (Sherratt and Sherratt 1991: 367-68; Marfoe 1987). How- ever, some intrepid northern Cypriot adventurers may have traveled to urban centers like Tarsus (the few Red-on-White Ware sherds, and then Red and Black Streak Burnished Ware sherds [Mellink 1991: 170-72]). Such exploration and resultant knowl- edge would have formed a source of considerable prestige and power in isolated Cyprus (Helms 1988). At any rate, once in contact, the more ad- vanced southern Anatolian civilizations offered an incredible source of prestige, fashion, and influence to be acquired, emulated, and displayed by the emergent elite in Cyprus as an ingredient of power. The "emergent" northwest Late Chalcolithic sites thus became the new Philia culture sites (contempo- rary with Late Chalcolithic elsewhere). Indeed, a few sites near Vasilia, for example, offer hints of the above process. These include Vasilia Kladomandra (Catling 1963, no. 156) which has a surface as- semblage with Chalcolithic to Philia culture/Early Cypriot components, and Vasilia Alonia where an assemblage of Chalcolithic ceramics also is associ- ated with a Philia culture knife and a few Red Polished Philia culture or Early Cypriot sherds (Karageorghis 1966: 326, figs. 70-72). In consequence, there would have been a very strong incentive for the emergent elite of northern Cyprus to have, and so trade for, such prestige goods, symbols, technology, and knowledge. Com- petition among the emergent elite at such sites alone would have made those goods a necessity merely to maintain relative status and control. The emergent elite would have been encouraged, even forced, to invest in the necessary means (e.g., Earle 1985). However, the ability to invest, to en- gage in long-distance trade in prestige goods, must be supported by some form of surplus production (Brumfiel and Earle 1987). That is a critical issue. A few people in society require a significant sur- plus for forms of investment. Although the simple intensive agricultural model likely for Neolithic- Chalcolithic Cyprus may be seen from finds of pithoi and store rooms to have produced some sur- plus, a few emergent elites now required a much greater surplus just for themselves. Moreover, such surplus items must be capable of mobilization. I suggest at this point, and for this reason, the acquisition by members of the emergent elite of cat- tle and equids and the technology of the secondary products revolution (from the same southern Anato- lian area, and in emulation of the elites there). For a given labor input, the technology permits greatly in- creased agricultural yields (especially of cereals) and provides the necessary transport. It is also suited to specialized extensive cultivation of a few crops, the requisite for a mobilized surplus and typ- ical of elite agriculture in the Aegean and Near East, but the antithesis of ubiquitous cautious small-scale diversified subsistence production in the Mediterranean environment (Halstead 1990; 1992; Jones 1992; Halstead and O'Shea 1989; Forbes 1982; Osborne 1987: 36-40; Gallant 1991)." In sum, the secondary products revolution package permits systemic change and the development of a new order of magnitude of production, and conse- quent activities. The new developments were previ- ously impossible within the constraints of hand-hoe, intensive, agriculture (Sherratt 1986). The emergent elite may also seek to produce their own value resources, or prestige goods, with which to trade, or for immediate display of status and wealth. Their agricultural surplus thus allows their support and sponsorship of specialized production. The evidence for the first significant exploitation of Cypriot copper in the Early Bronze Age, and the rapid development of Cypriot metallurgy in the Early Bronze Age (e.g., Gale 1991: 53-54, fig. 20; Gale and Stos-Gale 1989: 253-54, pl. 63; Stos- Gale, Macdonald, and Gale 1991; Balthazar 1990; Muhly 1991; Philip 1991), in apparent emulation of foreign metallurgy and its influence, may be a case of such specialized surplus production sponsored and supported by the (pre-existing) emergent elite in the context of a prestige goods economy and foreign</page><page sequence="14">48 STURT W. MANNING BASOR 292 stimulus.12 The limited range of metal types-nota- bly a few weapon types-and their restriction to a small number of burials adds further emphasis to the case (Philip 1991). Philia pottery might also be ascribed to specialized production associated with the emergent elite. Its origins in emulation of a perceived superior foreign fashion are obvious, but its nature and its distribution in Cyprus perhaps re- veal it as a specialist Cypriot prestige commodity. Whereas Late Chalcolithic monochrome ware fab- rics have strong regional characteristics (Peltenburg 1991b), Philia pottery from all over Cyprus shows a marked uniformity of fabric (Bolger 1991). This is the first time such a situation occurred in Cyprus, and it either reflects the rise of one dominant specialist production center exporting all over the island or the spread of a specialist type and tech- nology across the island as a valued prestige assemblage (metal artifact types represent another pan-island prestige fashion, see Philip 1991). THE DEAD SPEAK: PRESTIGE, THE PLOW, WEALTH, AND HIERARCHY The notable feature of finds of metalwork, Philia-Red Polished pottery, and other foreign im- ports, is their predominant association with mortu- ary contexts. Further, the association is with just some mortuary contexts.13 This second observation of mortuary differentiation may probably be em- ployed, in accord with a number of ethnographic parallels, as an indication that some of the living also enjoyed similar differentiation. However, the first observation is perhaps of more importance. The value objects are buried and removed from circulation. That appears a classic instance of a prestige goods economy in action (on such econo- mies, see Frankenstein and Rowlands 1978). Status depended on access to, and control of, prestige goods and their trade. So, if one has some, what to do? Use or display of status symbols is one possi- bility, but consumption by ceremonial burial (or other destruction, or permanent removal from cir- culation) is better (e.g., Meillassoux 1968). First, it conforms to the existing social and ideological for- mulation based around burial and ancestors; sec- ond, it displays status in an irrevocable way, unlike gift-giving or similar reciprocal forms; and third, it simultaneously removes the particular prestige item(s) from circulation, ensuring the lack of infla- tion or oversupply of such necessarily restricted goods. In such a way, religion, the social, and the economic can become interwoven and reversible.14 In Cyprus, the rise of a complex prestige goods economy, and the development of the secondary products revolution, would have led to dramatic and rapid change. The increased accumulation and power of wealth on the part of a few is only a re- flection. The sociopolitical impact is more pro- found. First, the introduction of plow agriculture would have fueled a politics of exclusion on the part of the emergent elite. Plows and equipment had to be constructed or obtained; oxen or donkeys or horses had to be acquired and-equally impor- tant-fed. The ordinary subsistence household at the bottom of the emerging sociopolitical system probably could not meet those overheads (Halstead 1987: 84; Renger 1990: 272-73). They could not compete. Even those further up the existing socio- economic scale, who could afford to participate with the minimum elements (an ox or equid and a plow), would find themselves in a trap. They could not maintain enough animals to breed their own cattle, donkeys, or horses, nor could they afford to keep a spare plow (consider Hesiod, Works and Days, 426ff.). Hence, in an attempt to stay com- petitive, they would become dependent on those larger-scale livestock owners or the specialists in the employ of the elite, who could supply them with their means of production (Gilman 1990: 161, n. 7). Second, the extensive nature of plow agriculture leads to shortages of land in favorable locations. For this reason, in Europe, the spread of plow agricul- ture is linked with a dispersal of settlement (e.g., Shennan 1986; Thomas 1987). However, in Cyprus, prime arable areas with good water supplies are more restricted. Increased competition for land might therefore be expected. This situation could see a growing importance in legitimation of land rights. Resort to depth of ancestry, to lineage, is a common response in such circumstances, and in turn begins to lay the foundations for a hereditary aristocracy. The rise of larger multiple burial tombs, and a grow- ing respect for previous burials and ancestors during the course of the Early Cypriot period, might form material correlates of such a process. In any event, plow agriculture transformed soci- ety (in general, see Goody 1976), and immediately and dramatically widened the gap between those at the top and those at the bottom. The elite glorified in their new power of surplus production, as wit- nessed in the appearance in the Early Cypriot pe- riod of prestige objects featuring oxen and plow scenes (e.g., Morris 1985: 275, 278-79, 285-86).</page><page sequence="15">1993 PRESTIGE, DISTINCTION, AND COMPETITION 49 Moreover, the surplus had to be mobilized, as in turn did the products derived from or supported by surplus production. Further, the supported products were designed for elite consumption, thus the distances were substantial: between villages or geographical areas. Thus an integral part of the secondary products revolution, and the extensifica- tion of agriculture, was the provision of ox and equid transport. They both empowered and created a means of control for those in possession. Equids are attested in use for transport from the late Early Cypriot (Sherratt 1981: 274, fig. 10.11). In such circumstances, and given the "costs" to obtain and support them, oxen and equids were themselves prestige items (Piggott 1992); they, too, thus join metal objects and "models" in select tombs (e.g., ox bones in several of the select tombs with metal objects at Vounous Cemetery A for example [Stewart and Stewart 1950: Tombs 96, 105, 107, 111, 161, 164A]; and equid remains in Tomb 322B at Lapithos, one of the 9 outstandingly "rich" tombs in the cemetery [Philip 1991: 90]). CONCLUSIONS This article explains the Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age divide in terms of a rapid revolution set amidst the normal pattern of oscillating social development within a given chronological and technological horizon. The revolution, and its lo- cation in the northwest, occurred because of a nexus between the luck of geography and a stage in history (both an emergent Late Chalcolithic on Cyprus, and the spread of the general mid-third millennium B.C.E. eastern Mediterranean "world system" [e.g., Sherratt and Sherratt 1991]). In this northwestern area, the potential availability, in- fluence, and cachet of foreign goods, ideas, and fashions stimulated change, and in particular lead the existing emergent elite to create a surplus economy to acquire the foreign desiderata. The northwest became the core for the extension of the new prestige goods and secondary products econo- mies over the rest of Cyprus. The preexisting Chalcolithic sites elsewhere, based on intensive agriculture, simply would have been made redun- dant and larger sites unviable, replaced by a few dispersed small sites of the new plow agricultural- ists in what was now a peripheral region of Cy- prus. In the new geopolitical paradigm, the south and west received their prestige goods and styles from the northwest (e.g., Philia culture artifacts, the odd north-coast Early Cypriot imports), a poor second division to the core northwest area that was integrated into the Aegean-Anatolian-eastern Mediterranean "world system."

Please note: the term Philia "culture" is employed in the sense that it is a term now given widespread use in Cypriot archaeology (refer- ences above). It is not yet shown that this "culture" con- forms to Childe's definition of a culture as a recurring assemblage; nor is it argued that "cultures" are in fact valid archaeological entities (e.g., Shennan 1989). A terminological problem also envelops the subse- quent Early Cypriot period. The elaborate EC I-III scheme, with further subdivisions, employed by Stewart (1962) has been criticized as an artificial and overcom- plex classificatory system (e.g., Knapp 1990). Seriated stratified data simply do not exist. Nonetheless, a basic division is evident in the Early Cypriot assemblages be- tween earlier groups, which would be within Stewart's EC I-IIIA, and the later groups, which would be within his EC IIIB and EC IIIB-MC I periods. At the ASOR meetings in November 1992, S. Swiny and E. Herscher</page><page sequence="16">50 STURT W. MANNING BASOR 292 proposed that the two groups be called Early Early Cypriot and Late Early Cypriot. Those terms are not to everyone's liking. Alternatives, such as the pre BA 1-2 system of Knapp (1990), also are of less than universal appeal. Other ideas abound. The EC I-IIIA material could be called "canonical" Early Cypriot, and the Early Cypriot IIIB-Middle Cypriot I material left as Late Early Cypriot, for example. This article does not impose any new terminology, and deliberately avoids definite terms. I use the term Early Cypriot, and then adjectives, such as early, mature, or late to qualify this. Sometimes a definition is offered in terms of the Swedish Cyprus Expedition conventions, other times it is left vague in line with the evidence. In general, early Early Cypriot = Early Cypriot I-IIIA (and especially Early Cypriot I-II as found at Vounous Cemetery A), mature Early Cyp- riot = Early Cypriot IIIA (e.g., Vounous Cemetery B), late Early Cypriot = Early Cypriot IIIB and Early Cyp- riot IIIB-Middle Cypriot I (e.g., as at Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba). 2Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg (1988: fig. 8c) show the locations of 14 of the 16 finds reported from two burials ("upper burial" and Tomb 14A; Hennessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg 1988: 21-22). The locations of only three of the four Early Cypriot objects from Tomb 14A are shown (nos. 2, 7, and 11; no. 13 is not plotted). The "upper burial" is later Early Cypriot, and its objects cluster together (upper left fig. 8c). There are then two groups of Philia objects (bottom right, and top right of fig. 8c; nos. 3, 5, 6, and 8, 9, 10 respectively). The three plotted Early Cypriot Tomb 14A objects (nos. 2, 7, and 11) rather tend to lie in a center to bottom left group of their own. The Philia culture vessels nos. 1 and 4 do, however, appear closely associated, especially no. 4, which is shown apparently superimposed on top of Early Cypriot no. 11. The photo of the in situ deposit (Hen- nessy, Eriksson, and Kehrberg 1988: fig. 24b) is less than helpful. The spout of Early Cypriot no. 11, in fact, appears to be above Philia culture no. 4. Moreover, the excavated pit around no. 4, and its condition in the pho- tograph, suggest that is not in situ at all, but has been lifted and replaced(?). Early Cypriot nos. 2 and 7 do, however, appear to be part of the Philia culture deposit. Nonetheless, the context is disturbed and not a clearly defined burial chamber or dromos. 3Despite Todd's writing that "Philia-type pottery has not been found in the Vasilikos Valley" (1991: 15), one Philia culture site might appear to exist from references by other authors to Philia culture material at the otherwise Late Chalcolithic site of Kalavasos Arkhangelos (e.g., Swiny 1985a: 14, n. 3; 1986; 30; Bolger 1991: fig. 3.1). 41 thank E. J. Peltenburg for drawing this site to my attention. 5But cf. Knapp (this issue, pp. 85-106, figs. 2, 3), where an exponential curve is incorrectly created by re- ordering the site data out of their approximate chrono- logical sequence (e.g., Middle Cypriot Phaneromeni and Early Cypriot Kaminoudhia are placed before Late Chal- colithic Mosphilia). 6The number of settlements did, however, increase significantly from the Chalcolithic to Early Cypriot- Middle Cypriot periods (Swiny 1989: 16). 7This generalization is just that: a generalization. It applies in most cases, but there are exceptions (whether societies, or specific instances). Criticism of the general- ization must be specific. For example, Soles criticized Whitelaw (1983a) for employing the above observa- tions. He stated, " . . . the assumption that large popula- tions always exhibit a hierarchical social organization is incorrect. There are many large populations that do not, and population size is not a necessary determinant of social ranking" (1988: 50). But Soles' view is not valid. Soles is, of course, correct that there are some instances of large populations without evidence of hierarchical, or more usually, marked hierarchical, social organization. However, the issue is his use of the word "many." That is incorrect; such instances are uncommon among re- corded human societies. For example, only ca. 3 percent of one recent large worldwide sample of hunter- gatherers had populations of ca. _500 (Whitelaw 1991: figs. 1-3). Similarly, in another study of non- or low- hierarchy sedentary societies, over 80 percent of cases had &lt;400 population (Kosse 1990). Further, the exam- ples of larger communities (&gt;500 population) with a supposed lack of hierarchical social organization usually do not stand up on examination. They may not have a clear centralized hierarchy, but an elaborate social orga- nization is usually present (of a type not found in other smaller nonhierarchical societies). The Indian communi- ties of the northwest coast of North America are good examples. Such communities were often of considerable size, but were internally segregated into separate pro- ductive housegroups. Socially, the members of each household were ranked, and the relations be- tween different members of the group were regu- lated by social conventions. The different houses within a community would be inter-linked by alli- ances, and by kin relations between individual members of the different houses. In addition, each house was ranked relative to the others, and each lineage would have a senior chief, among the chiefs of each house of that lineage. Village chiefs might be recognized, though their authority depended very much on the abilities of the individual holding that position. Thus, such communities were held together by an elaborate series of social conven- tions, and hierarchical differentiation... Such rel- atively elaborate social organization allowed the maintenance of relatively large and dense commu- nities" (Whitelaw 1991: 176). If we accept the above approximate 500 population threshold as an empirical observation, the question arises as to whether it may be explained. Here, as Upham (1990b: 101) notes, it is interesting that "a community of 500 is also the approximate size of the minimum local</page><page sequence="17">1993 PRESTIGE, DISTINCTION, AND COMPETITION 51 population in which endogamy is possible on a regular basis." Thus one could argue that once the principle of least effort as applied to mating strategy favors effective group closure, a circumscribed social environment de- velops, and so the potential for hierarchical evolution. For example, as Upham suggests, once a group is largely endogamous, paradigms of power through control of mating and reproduction become viable (e.g., Meillas- soux 1978; Friedman and Rowlands 1977). The other approach is to develop the arguments of Johnson (1982) concerning scalar stress. On the one hand, as community size grows, so do face-to-face interactions and thus the potentials for stress and conflict. On the other hand, low-level mechanisms of social organization that can overcome those stresses at lesser population levels (e.g., extended families or simultaneous hierarchies) can no longer manage when the population becomes too large. Thus at some point a new tier of management is necessary (cf. also, Johnson 1978; van der Leeuw 1981: 254-60, 315, Johnson comment). In addition, since most settle- ments of ca. ?500 population are sedentary, the effects of sedentism are relevant. The sedentary way of life inten- sifies and institutionalizes the interaction and manage- ment stresses; and it may certainly be observed that as societies become sedentary their settlement densities be- come lower (e.g., Whitelaw 1991: Table 2). That is usu- ally explained in terms of an adaptation to minimize unwanted interaction with strangers or nonkin. However, this spatial extension, and consequent fragmentation of the society into discrete (kin) groups, also offers another explanation for the development of social organization. In contrast to a tightly knit, densely settled, hunter-gatherer camp where information passes rapidly and easily without its being specifically directed or administered, the lower density, fragmented, sedentary society requires informa- tion to be specially sent to the various discrete elements each of which is busy minimizing its unwanted social con- tacts. Thus, as group size increases, hunter-gatherer style horizontal organization will not work or becomes too costly, and a vertical organization is more suitable. 8If Croft is correct to discount a few finds from "un- reliable contexts" (1991: Table 2; notes b, c). 91 thank S. Swiny for drawing this to my attention. o1Two likely routes to this position seem possible. First, it could be a dependent role, based on another power source, such as being the head of a particular lineage (or a nominee). Second, it could be an independent role- once created-based around successful competition and negotiation among several lineage groupings. iThe key point of note is that the secondary prod- ucts revolution does not by itself create an elite. Instead, it is a technology and economy taken up or exploited by an existing emergent elite in appropriate social, eco- nomic, and political circumstances. 12Metallurgy itself did not create the elite (compare arguments of, e.g., Gilman 1981; Hastorf 1990: 157-58). This point is distinct from the subsequent use of metal- lurgy, and its control and restriction, to offer a source of power (Morris 1989; Knapp 1990; 1993a). We may see the sequence as: imported prestige items create incentive to acquire and develop extensive second- ary-products-revolution-based agriculture in order to support an ability to engage in sociopolitical competition, which leads to an elite, who then control the directed means to create and support specialist production, includ- ing metallurgy. This sequence is also required from the context of social power. Social competition, and social power within society, are determined by negotiation and interpretation within societal norms and their reproduc- tion: thus individuals act in their perceived best interests (which may be altruistic), and attempts change in their fa- vor but at the same time are constrained by the accepted cultural norms (Giddens 1981; 1984; Foucault 1980). This includes even the incipient elite. To be successful, a dramatic change or innovation is therefore most likely to be a development from the logic of the existing social norms. Prestige goods were within the realm of social competition in Chalcolithic-Early Cypriot Cyprus. Thus the elaboration of the means for the acquisition of such value items, given the incentive, is reasonable. Since ag- riculture, its control, and some forms of storage and mo- bilization were also being practiced by the Middle-Later Chalcolithic at larger sites, the development of a further extensification and mobilization to meet a socially ac- ceptable inflation in competitive values and needs would also be reasonable. Only when the first two developments had redefined society to include a new set of norms based around an elite, could the further development, within this context, of specialist production take place. Thus metals did not offer a starting point. Indeed, their first importance was subsequent to the secondary products revolution, and developed metallurgy was later still. Metals were initially rare value items that acted as prestige goods which symbolized and denoted the dif- ferentiation and status created and supported by the sec- ondary products revolution. Many early metal items on Cyprus were thus imports, even though Cyprus was a significant metal source. Only in a subsequent step, around the close of the third millennium B.C.E., once elite sponsored and controlled specialist production had begun and the inflation of prestige and complexity had set in, did metal production become desirable for a further mag- nitude of internal competition, and external integration and trade. At that point the role of metallurgy changed "from being essentially a representation of distinctions rooted in the local subsistence situation to one in which its control could actually be used in appropriate circum- stances to create social and economic distinctions" (Shennan 1986: 117). 13For example, consider the cemetery of Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba (Herscher 1978; Swiny 1989: 27). The whole complex is better off than many, but major inter- nal differentiation is apparent: 97 burial chambers were excavated, 34 have no metal finds, and a mere 9 burial chambers have 64 percent of all copper and bronze arti- facts (446 of 701). 14This is based on Gregory (1980; 1982); the argu- ment has been exploited in archaeology by Bradley</page><page sequence="18">52 STURT W. MANNING BASOR 292 (1982; 1984: 96-127; 1985), among others. Competitive consumption based around gifts and similar reciprocal modes contains the inherent limitation that the social rules of reciprocity allow a status gain, or imbalance, in favor of the giver at one occasion, to be redressed at a later occasion. Thus net gain is not catered for in terms of any one transaction, rather a systematic form of alternat- ing disequilibrium. Net gain in such a system can only come from the overall number and scale of reciprocal re- lationships with different persons which an individual can maintain. In contrast, gifts made to the gods, or an- cestors, create the possibility of a socially acceptable, ideological, form of display that enhances the giver's sta- tus but without the risk of the gift being returned in due course (from within the secular world). All such gifts offer a net gain of prestige. Further, their one-way nature has the added advantage of removing the gifts from cir- culation, thus helping to maintain the value of such items and making it more difficult for others to emulate the gift without obtaining new supplies of the rare prestige items. In such circumstances, as Bradley (1984: 105) argues, "[R]eligion can function as economy and economy as religion (cf., Friedman 1979: 304-17)." BIBLIOGRAPHY Adams, R.
