<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMPENSATING THE ACCIDENT VICTIM By P. S. Atiyah * Every year thousands of people are killed and many more injured in accidents of various sorts. The accident victim (and this includes the dependents of those killed) may suffer pain and disablement, and in addi tion he may be faced with serious financial loss. There will be medical and hospital expenses which may extend in serious cases to the need for months or years of medical and nursing care. There may be additional out of pocket expenses in paying (for example) for wheel chairs or adapta tions to a house to suit the disabilities incurred. For an income earner there may be a loss of earnings which in the case of fatal accidents will of course be permanent, and in the case of injuries may extend for months or even years. In the case of a non-working wife and mother, other expenses may be incurred by a family to replace the services normally rendered by a housewife. In most modern societies it would be regarded as intoler able to leave the accident victim to bear these burdens without any assistance. In fact compensation is available to many accident victims in a great variety of ways but the different methods of compensation have grown up with little reference to each other, and the result is a ramshackle and complex structure with little rational basis. The principal methods of compensating the accident victim are these: The common law action for damages. Workmen's Compensation. Medical benefits insurance. Other forms of personal accident insurance. Social Welfare payments. I propose to say something about each of these compensation systems, but I have not space here to cover other less important methods of com pensation, such as compensation for criminal injuries. The common law action for damages The common law of torts enables a person who suffers personal injury through the fault of another, to sue the party at fault and obtain from him full compensation for all the financial loss he has suffered. The common law action also gives monetary compensation, assessed by the Courts, for non-pecuniary losses, such as pain and suffering and disablement. In * P. S.

"The Australian Quarterly", Volume 43, No. 2, June, 1971, pp. 16-24. 16</page><page sequence="2">ACCIDENT VICTIMS fatal accident cases the position is broadly similar, except that the action is brought for the benefit of dependents and in this case damages are in general awarded only for financial loss, and not for the distress caused by the bereavement itself. In both cases damages are awarded in a lump sum which has to be settled once and for all at the time of judgment.1 Because the common law action can only be brought against a party "at fault", the greater part of the law has been concerned with the definition of "fault" for this purpose. In principle this covers intentional assaults and negligently caused injury, but in practice there are few cases in the former category. Negligence in law means a failure to take reasonable care, a failure to observe standards of normal prudence and care. Lawyers have traditionally judged the requisite standard of care by reference to the conduct of the "reasonable man", but there is something slightly mis leading about this. In practice the concept of the reasonable man is merely the "anthropomorphic conception of justice" as it has been termed; and the necessary standard of care is, and must be, laid down by Courts and juries. If the accident victim (or in fatal cases, the deceased) was himself partly to blame for the accident, his "contributory negligence" was formerly a complete bar to a claim for damages at common law. But under legislation now operative in a similar form throughout Australia, contributory negli gence merely reduces the compensation payable according to the degree of fault of the parties; thus the victim who is partly to blame for the accident can still recover some compensation, though not in full. The common law action has recently been the subject of a great deal of criticism by lawyers in many countries,2 but in order to understand these criticisms it is necessary to say something about the way the law works in practice. In the first place it is an undoubted fact that common law dam ages are very rarely paid by the party in fault. In almost every case they are paid by insurance companies. In road accident cases, this is achieved by the system of compulsory third-party insurance in force throughout Australia. In industrial accident cases, employers' liability insurance is also very widespread and in some cases compulsory. In other cases it would be very rare for the accident victim to claim damages from anyone other than a corporation or a public authority of some kind, most of whom also carry public liability policies. There are two obvious results of all this. The first is that in practice very few accident victims ever obtain common law damages outside the two main areas of road accidents and work accidents, and the second is that the common law system in fact operates as an insurance system, though a system of a very peculiar kind. The peculiarity, of course, lies in the fact that accident victims do not insure themselves, as in other types of insurance, but each other. Every motorist, for example, under a normal third-party policy, is insuring 1 This is not now true of Western Australia, where orders for periodical payments are possible. 2 See my "Accidents, Compensation and the Law" (London, 1970) for a detailed account. 17</page><page sequence="3">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1971 his potential victims, but not himself in respect of personal injury.3 Amongst other things, this means that the premiums cannot be geared to the amount that each potential victim has at stake, as would be the case with ordinary "first-party" insurance. The second important aspect of the practical operation of the tort system is that very few cases are actually litigated to the stage of judgment. The great majority?probably well over 90%?are settled by negotiation and agreement between the accident victim (or his lawyers) and the in surance company of the party claimed to be at fault. Cases of this kind do not appear in the Law Reports and are therefore not generally discussed in the law books. But recent studies in America, Canada and Australia have brought to light a number of disturbing facts about these settlements. The most serious of these is the way in which the process of settling common law claims favours the less seriously injured as opposed to the more seriously injured. Both with regard to the time taken to obtain com pensation, and with regard to the proportion of losses which are ultimately recovered, it is clear that the more serious the injury, the worse is the outcome. It is in the light of facts such as these that the common law system is now being subject to such severe criticism. Among the accusations levelled at this system, the following are the most serious. First, it is excessively expensive in operation. The proportion of premiums which goes to accident victims varies from country to country, and probably from state to state in Australia, but there is no doubt that the system costs far more to operate than other forms of insurance. In one way and another, probably no more than half of the premiums are eventually paid out to accident victims. Second, the delays in obtaining payment, especially in serious cases, are quite intolerable, extending in many cases to two, three or four years, and in rare cases even longer. Third, the award of compensation in a lump-sum is unsatisfactory. Insofar as the compensation is designed to replace a lost income, what is obviously needed is a system of periodical payments. In any event the once for all principle means that much guesswork is often involved in trying to assess the probable future effects of the injury on the accident victim?to what extent will he recover, how are his future earnings prospects likely to be affected, in the case of a widow, will she remarry, and so on. Fourthly, the reduc tion of damages for contributory negligence may severely penalise an accident victim for what may have been a mere momentary aberration. It will be observed that, though the negligent defendant is not usually penalised for his negligence (since his insurers will pay the damages), the negligent victim will be penalised by reduction of his damages. Fifthly, there is a good deal of scepticism about the process of ascertaining and proving who was at fault. Most accidents happen in a split second of 3 This is not, of course, true of the comprehensive policy in which the owner of a car insures his own car. 18</page><page sequence="4">ACCIDENT VICTIMS time and many lawyers are dubious of the value of the reconstruction of these accidents from the evidence of witnesses (of whom at least two will be more or less interested parties) sometimes given years after the event. Moreover, there are often situations in which the victim, while clearly blameless himself, is simply unable to produce the sort of evidence needed to satisfy a court. Sixthly, and perhaps most important of all, relatively few accident victims ever obtain any common law damages, and of these only a small number obtain compensation in full. Rather under half of road accident victims probably obtain some compensation in damages; a very much smaller proportion of those injured at work do likewise; but of all other accident victims only a handful ever recover any damages at all because of their inability to find a wealthy or insured defendant. Workmen's Compensation The failings of the common law system were aggravated, in the industrial accident field, by a number of additional legal principles which in the nineteenth century meant that very few injured workmen indeed were ever able to obtain damages. To remedy this situation the system of Workmen's Compensation was devised. The first Workmen's Compensation Act was passed in England in 1897 and similar legislation was later copied through out Australia. Under these Acts a workman injured in the course of his employment is entitled to compensation from his employer irrespective of proof of fault. The compensation payable is on a much less generous scale than that obtainable at common law, but in other aspects the system has many advantages over common law damages. First, the injured work man is assured of compensation; secondly he will receive it more quickly; thirdly it may be paid in the form of periodical payments rather than a lump sum; and fourthly the system is very much cheaper to operate. It is cheaper largely because it eliminates the two principal sources of dispute in a common law claim which are responsible for the heavy legal costs at common law. First, adjudication on fault disappears; and secondly, the amount of compensation is not calculated ad hoc in each case but is arrived at by application of particular rules set out in the legislation. In particular the virtually impossible task of assessing compensation for pain and suffering is eliminated and replaced by a statutory tariff of benefits payable for specified disabilities?so much for loss of a leg, so much for a blinded eye, and so forth. Medical Benefits Insurance The cost of medical and hospital expenses may, of course, be recovered in a common law claim, or a claim for workmen's compensation. Some medical expenses are also payable in respect of road accidents under comprehensive policies. In other cases, the victim may be able to rely on his ordinary medical benefits insurance as supplemented by the Com 19</page><page sequence="5">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1971 monwealth Government scheme. But many accident victims do not have medical benefits insurance and if they are unable to obtain damages or workmen's compensation they will in theory have to bear these expenses themselves. In practice, however, there appears to be a substantial element of assistance for the accident victim even if he has no direct recourse to compensation or insurance for these costs. Many doctors and hospitals deliberately adjust the amount of their charges where it is known that the victim will have to bear the cost himself. And in practice many of these charges are ultimately written off as irrecoverable altogether. In Victoria, a new scheme has just been brought into operation under which all road accident victims will be relieved of the cost of hospital charges whether for in-patient or out-patient treatment. The basis of this scheme is that road traffic insurers will pay 80% of the normal hospital account for all services rendered to road accident victims, and the hos pitals waive their claims to the remaining 20%. Other forms of personal accident insurance There is nothing to prevent a person insuring himself privately against the risk of personal accident, or even against any accident or illness caus ing a loss of income. But in practice this kind of insurance is still un common. Whatever the reason may be, few people insure their own earning capacity although this is by far the most valuable asset that the ordinary person has. Social Welfare Payments Most modern societies have social welfare programmes which provide some degree of social security for the person who is unable to provide himself with an income through accident or disease or the like. Under the Commonwealth Social Services legislation, for example, provision is made for invalid pensions for the permanently disabled, for pensions for various classes of widows and for sickness benefits. These benefits differ, of course, in important respects from common law damages and workmen's com pensation. They are not designed so much to compensate for losses as to meet basic needs; hence they are little more than subsistence level benefits, they do not vary with the former earnings of the recipient, and they are subject to stringent means tests. Nevertheless they represent an important step because they indicate the acceptance of some responsibility by society for assisting (among others) the accident victim. In England the modern social security system has moved closer to other forms of compensation in two major respects, firstly in that most benefits are payable without a means test, and secondly in that many short-term benefits are now earnings related. Criticism of the existing position The plethora of existing systems for compensating the accident victim cries out for integration and reform. To start with, the way in which 20</page><page sequence="6">ACCIDENT VICTIMS the accident victim is treated today depends far too much on one for tuitous factor?namely how did the accident occur? For example, A is killed in a factory accident, B is killed in a road accident caused by another driver's fault, C is killed by falling off a ladder repairing his roof at home. Widow A gets workmen's compensation, Widow B gets common law damages while Widow C can get nothing but a widow's social service pension. Or again, X is seriously injured in a road accident due to nobody's fault, while Y suffers minor injuries partly due to his own fault and partly to the fault of another driver. X receives no compensation for his loss of earnings (unless he was driving to or from work, when he can obtain workmen's compensation). Y will obtain damages, though scaled down because of his contributory negligence. Another consequence of the multiplicity of compensation systems is that much energy, and considerable cost, is devoted to solving 'demarcation disputes'. Endless problems arise, for example, in determining whether an accident occurred in the course of the victim's employment so as to entitle him to claim workmen's compensation. Moreover, there is a con tinuous attempt by those operating each separate compensation system to "pass the buck" to those operating other systems. For instance, medical benefit funds may pay the victim's medical expenses but then attempt to recoup the cost from an insurance company responsible for paying damages or workmen's compensation. Insurers liable for workmen's com pensation payments may likewise attempt to recoup themselves from someone else alleged to have been to blame for the accident, who in turn will claim against his insurers. And so on. Further, it is now generally recognised that nearly all the compensation systems treat the more seriously injured relatively less favourably than the less seriously injured. The social and financial problems facing those who suffer really serious long term incapacity are clearly quite different from those arising from minor injuries. Yet, for every really serious injury case, there are thousands of minor injuries, and the administrative costs of processing minor claims are quite disproportionately large. It is also arguable?though this is more controversial?that compensating for medical expenses and replacing a lost income ought to be a much higher priority than compensation for pain and suffering and disablement. A person who receives quite minor injuries in a road accident and is able to prove fault against another may recover a moderate sum for "pain and suffering" over and above actual financial loss. Since there are such a large number of these minor claims, the total cost of pain and suffering awards runs into many millins of dollars annually. There is much to be said for the view that this money could be better spent in assisting those serious accident victims who are at present less favourably treated, but whose needs seem much greater. 21</page><page sequence="7">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1971 Proposals for reform Australia is very far from being unique in regard to the present un satisfactory methods of compensating the accident victim. Similar problems are to be found in many countries throughout the world, and in recent times many proposals for radical reform have been made. Developments in the past two or three years suggest that the time for argument is now running out, and action is likely to begin?indeed has begun already. There are two main types of scheme which have been propounded. The first is confined to road accidents and would substitute for the present inefficient, expensive and unfair third-party insurance system, a "first party" insurance system. Under this scheme?a version of which is now operating in Massachusetts?the road accident insurance policy would become a policy which insures the driver and anybody in his vehicle against income loss and medical expenses arising from a road accident. The policy would also cover pedestrians and cyclists and other victims (except the occupants of another vehicle) on a no-fault basis. Compensa tion for income loss would be payable periodically as the loss accrues, and hopefully, little delay would be involved. Tort liability would be abolished for personal injuries caused by negligence on the road. Since this system would provide compensation for everyone injured on the roads it would plainly be more costly than the present system unless the amount of compensation is somewhat below the figure for full com mon law damages. Accordingly, the proponents of most of these schemes suggest ways in which savings could be made. The more obvious of these are (1) by eliminating, or at least reducing, awards for pain and suffering (though this might be provided as an optional extra for an additional premium); (2) by providing a ceiling on the size of incomes which would be covered, leaving the very high income earner to take out optional extra cover if he wishes; (3) by paying only a stipulated proportion of losses, such as 80% or 90%, though without reduction for contributory negligence; and (4) by having a reasonable "excess" to eliminate the minor claims which absorb so much in administrative cost. Even with savings such as these there is little doubt that extra cost would be involved, and an important question is whether this cost should be borne solely by motorists or should be partly borne by the community as a whole. Many lawyers consider that if no-fault liability is to be intro duced, then there is no reason to place the whole cost on the motorist. But it is often overlooked that a substantial cost already falls on the community as a whole in many ways, e.g., the cost of Commonwealth supplementation of medical benefits, the cost of widows' and invalid benefits, the costs attributable to police duties arising out of accidents, and so on. A variant on these first-party insurance schemes has recently been proposed by a Committee on Third Party Claims appointed by the Chief Secretary in Victoria. This Committee has recommended that a 22</page><page sequence="8">ACCIDENT VICTIMS State Road Accident Benefit Board should be set up to which all claims would go in the first instance. The Board would pay compensation on a no-fault basis to all road accident victims, and the payments would be made periodically. The Board would be re-imbursed by the insurance companies on the same basis as nominal defendant claims (i.e., those claims which are at present met by insurers though no individual defendant has been identified as responsible for the accident). Claims for damages would remain possible in principle, but only in those cases in which loss of earnings still continues after two years; it is not entirely clear what the Committee envisages is to happen to claim for pain and suffering. The Committee recognised that such a scheme would be an interim one, "a first instalment in the establishment of a proper and adequate system of financial compensation which can be expanded as required by the community in the future". It estimated the necessary increase in third party premiums at about 30%. The Woodhouse Report Much more radical proposals are contained in the Report of the Wood house Royal Commission in New Zealand in 1967. This Committee pro posed total abolition of the common law action for accidental injury and death, and its replacement by a State run comprehensive accident in surance scheme. The whole population would become insured by the State against the risk of all accidents which would henceforth be treated in the same way. Income losses would be covered up to a maximum of 80% of normal earnings after tax, and disability benefits would in addition be payable under a tariff scheme similar to that in use in workmen's com pensation laws. Last year a Parliamentary Select Committee re-examined the Woodhouse Proposals and has modified them in some respects. Under the Committee's proposals two schemes will be operative. The first will insure all income earners against accidents whenever and however occur ring; the second scheme will insure all road accident victims, whether income earners or not. The schemes will be basically the same?benefits payable under them will be assessed in the same way?and the division is proposed mainly for administrative convenience. The principal practical difference between this scheme and the rather more visionary Woodhouse proposals is that no protection for housewives injured in accidents, other than road accidents, will now be available. No doubt this gap may be filled in due course. The New Zealand scheme is not expected to cost much above the total cost of all existing schemes and will be financed mainly by levies replacing the existing third party motor premiums and workmen's compensation insurance premiums. Sickness and disease This article has been concerned with the accident victim, but it will be seen that there is little logic in perpetuating the distinction between accident and disease. If all accident victims should be protected against income 23</page><page sequence="9">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY, JUNE, 1971 loss and even disability arising from accidents, why should the victims of disease be less favourably treated? This clearly raises very wide issues and the possible cost of protecting the whole population against income loss and disablement from disease would be very great. The Woodhouse Report, though confined to accidents, hinted that there was little logic in distinguishing between accident and disease, and a new Royal Com mission in New Zealand is now examining the Social Security provisions for the victim of disease. It does not seem wildly idealistic to envisage the possibility of New Zealand eventually operating a complete National Accident and Sickness Insurance scheme which eliminates, so far as practicable, all differences between accidental injuries and disabilities from disease. State or Private Insurance The many proposals for replacing the present structure of compensation laws raise one particularly difficult issue?should a new scheme be run by the State or private insurers? No doubt the political philosophy of those responsible will eventually answer this question, but there is one strong argument in favour of State run schemes which I find almost overwhelm ing. Where income loss has to be compensated for over many years, as in fatal cases, or in cases of permanent incapacity, there is no doubt that periodical payments will need to be regularly increased in order to keep up with inflation and increasing national prosperity. I find it very difficult to see how private insurers are going to be able to make the necessary adjustments. While they may be able to face inflation, it is hard to see how payments derived from premiums today can be increased over twenty or thirty years as the nation's standard of living increases. And if this is not done, no matter how generous a compensation system may be in its inception, the long-term disabled will continue to receive a somewhat raw deal. 24</page></plain_text>
