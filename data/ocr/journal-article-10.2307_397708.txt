This can be done simply and easily by making a bequest in your will or through your life insurance. An attorney can handle bequests readily and may be able to show tax savings to your estate. In making your testament of faith, please consider the Endowment Fund of the American Association of Teachers of French. Your contribu- tion will be invested and only the income will be used. This means that your support will continue perpetually. The income will be used to promote all the goals and activities of the AATF. Your gift will be very helpful and will be greatly appreciated. Con- trary to what most people think, large sums are not required in a bequest. Many members banding together can provide a significant sum that will help ensure the future of our Association. The following bequest form may be helpful. (And it would assist the Association in its long-range planning if you would inform us that your bequest has been made, either specifying the amount or not as you prefer.) I give and bequeath to the American Association of Teachers of French, a non-profit charitable organization located at 57 East Armory Avenue, Champaign, Illinois 61820, for the uses and pur- poses of the Endowment Fund of the Association the sum of $ (or the following described property: ) When writing to advertisers, please mention the Review-it helps</page><page sequence="3">Guide for Authors The French Review endorses the MLA Style Manual (1985) and its student-oriented version the MLA Handbook, third edition (1988). We expect all authors to follow the direc- tions of these manuals; we also wish to emphasize the following points: 1. All articles are to be submitted to the Editor in Chief. The normal maximum for articles, including endnotes, is 5,000 words. AATF membership is a prerequisite for the submission of articles. All articles must be accompanied by an Abstract of 100 words, maximum, that refers to the text in the third person. 2. The French Review subscribes to a policy of "blind" submissions: Assistant Editors will not know the identity of the authors whose articles they are asked to evaluate. Authors must therefore omit references that would allow them to be identified. Typescripts are to be prefaced by a separate cover page giving the title of the article, the author's name, address, institution, and telephone number. Send with the article the equivalent of ten first- class US postage stamps or $3.00. 3. Contributions may be in English or French, but contributors are very earnestly urged to use the language in which they can write more effectively. For articles in French, see 9, below. 4. All contributions must be typed on standard-size paper with double-spacing through- out, including Works Cited, endnotes (see under 7, below), block quotations of prose or verse, and headings of book reviews (see under 8, below). Please send three high quality photocopies; these will not be returned. If the article is accepted, the Editor will request the original typescript and a diskette, if the text has been wordprocessed. 5. Perfect legibility is essential, especially with articles or quotes in French. The printer is not expected to know foreign languages and usually cannot decipher foreign words writ- ten in by hand; if type is not clean she may not be able to distinguish "c" from "e" or "o." Type or print all corrections legibly above the line involved. Never write anything in the margins. 6. For spelling, hyphenation, determination of foreign words, etc., consult Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language. Underline the titles of books, plays, and periodicals. In titles of French periodicals the first word and all principal words are capitalized (La Revue des Deux Mondes). In titles of French books and plays, the first word is always capitalized; if a substantive immediately follows an initial article, it is also capitalized; if the substantive is preceded by an adjective both are capitalized; if the title begins with any word other than an article or adjective, the words following are all in lower case: La Semaine sainte; Les Belles Amours; A la recherche du temps perdu. (MLA Handbook, section 2.7.1; Style Manual, 2.4.2) 7. "The Works Cited section lists all of the works that have contributed ideas and infor- mation to your text. It simplifies documentation because it permits you to make only brief references to these works in the text" (Style Manual 4.1). "Usually the author's last name and a page reference are enough to identify the source and specific location from which you have borrowed material" (MLA Handbook 5.2) Since purely bibliographical information will now be handled by references in the text to the Works Cited, endnotes will be reserved for explanatory material or for a listing of bibliographical sources too long to be conveniently inserted in the text (MLA Handbook 5.6, 5.8.2, 5.8.4.). When used, endnotes are numbered consecutively, not by the page, but throughout the entire article. Reference numbers are typed above the line and outside punctuation marks, exactly as they are to appear in print. The Notes themselves should be paragraphed and typed with double spacing, on separate sheets following the last page of the article. The Works Cited will follow the Notes, on separate sheets. 8. Contributors to special departments, especially reviewers of books and films, should study our typographical arrangements carefully. When writing a review, the following data must always be furnished: author's names (last name first), title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, ISBN number, number of pages in the case of a book, size and rpms or ips in the case of discs or tapes, and price (in the currency of the country of publication). 9. Exception to the MLA Handbook: articles written in French are published and should be prepared in accordance with French typographical norms: for example, endnote numbers and closing quotation marks precede punctuation, and ellipses are indicated in brackets, as [...].</page><page sequence="4">AATF BUREAU DE CORRESPONDANCE SCOLAIRE offers you the chance to vitalize your classes with letters from France. You send us a list of your interested students giving name, age, and special interests of each, and they will be matched as closely as possible with the names of students in France. The correspondance is initiated on this side of the Atlantic. We send you the names and addresses of French boys and girls that match your students, and the Americans write the first letter. Service charge is 500 per name under this plan. There is also the possibility of group correspondance-class to class, by letter and tape.
