<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 87  6 A new breed of biologist, 1900– 10 During the first decade of the new century, Bloomsbury scientists were  at the centre of a number of ground-b reaking scientific advances, includ-  ing the birth of genetics and ecology. This progress gave Ray Lankester   a warm sense of achievement, a feeling that his academic mission had  been worthwhile, that the improvements to science education really  had opened up careers to people from ordinary backgrounds. The wider  ambitions of other Edwardian leaders also allowed groups such as the   Fabians, the Eugenics Society and the Men and Women’s Club to recom- mend policy changes to the politicians, leading to different approaches to  the problems facing those living in the city slums. Across different parts  of Britain there was an optimistic atmosphere that scientific advances  were steadily improving the quality of life.  Lankester’s own student of marine biology, Raphael Weldon, had  succeeded him to the chair of zoology at UCL and had become highly  regarded as a teacher:  ‘Seldom is it given to a man to teach as Weldon  taught. He lectured almost as one inspired. His extreme earnestness was  only equalled by his lucidity. He awoke enthusiasm even in the dullest,    and had the divine gift of compelling interest.’1 Weldon also became  well known through his campaigning against the amalgamation of UCL  and King’s College into a single ‘Albert University’. During vacations  Weldon worked hard at the Marine Biological Association laboratory at  Plymouth, which Lankester had founded in 1888. One of Weldon’s pro- jects there lasted several years and involved him collecting thousands  of shrimps from their natural habitats. He took several measurements  for each one and plotted them to show how characters varied across  87 </page> <page sequence="2"> 88 the species’ population. His statistical analysis of these data showed the   changes were slow and steady.  Weldon’s contemporary in studying biology at Cambridge, William   Bateson, didn’t altogether believe this conclusion. He had earlier evi- dence to show that species evolved more quickly than Darwin had  assumed and that sudden mutations were caused by sudden environ-  mental stress. Bateson had collected shrimps in the rapidly drying-o ut  Aral Sea and found many new species living in water with very high sal- inity. This explanation didn’t impress Weldon, who reacted by writing,  ‘The questions raised by the Darwinian hypothesis are purely statistical,  and the statistical method is the only one at present obvious by which the     hypothesis can be experimentally checked.’2 The statement was affirm- ation that Weldon had moved to Bloomsbury where he was using the  statistical methods of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson on his own data  and interpreting in his own way. Here was a useful difference of opinion.  Weldon, and the statisticians, had curves showing that change was slow  and smooth, while sceptics of Darwin’s gradualism, like Bateson, had evi- dence of sudden responses to stress. It was what he called a saltation, or   now, a mutation. One of the first sceptics of gradual evolutionary change was Herbert   Spencer, and he had arranged an informal meeting to discuss the dif-  ferences. It was at the Savile Club on 9 December 1893. Together with   Galton, Wallace and Lankester, Weldon presented his case for obtaining  more evidence by conducting statistical enquiry into the variability of  organisms. The meeting agreed that the statistical method was a prom- ising way to check Darwin’s hypothesis experimentally. Later, the same   group became the Evolution Committee of the Royal Society. The work   confirmed that Lankester and Tansley were right to look at the whole  organism and the physical environment for evidence. In order to carry  out thorough statistical analysis, it was essential to include data from as  many parts of the system as possible though it was agreed that the results  could never be better than the quality of the incoming data. Most other  investigators were set on the new mission to discover the smallest part  of the cell, expecting to join with the chemists and physicists in finding   mathematically defined laws. It frightened Lankester that both directions  of study were so vast. He realised that understanding the mechanism of   evolution was going to take a long time.  Lankester wanted to monitor the progress of these different  research projects in biology. He took advantage of Spencer’s initiative by  inviting the same Evolution Committee group to a series of monthly din- ners. A sudden fall in student numbers had made him afraid that many  88 BlooMsBury sCIentIsts </page> <page sequence="3"> 89 bright young people were being seduced away from science and evolu- tionary biology in particular by poor employment prospects. He wanted  the committee’s help to find a way through the impasse: just where was  biology heading? He also wanted to discuss new ways of studying evo- lution. Were the elusive hereditary agents going to be found by looking  down the microscope, by looking out into the environment or even by  formulating a mathematical equation? Lankester was too deeply entrenched in marine biology to do other  research, but he never gave up hope that he might find a new way to  prove Darwin’s theories. Looking at how different species developed was  hard work, and brought little reward. He was often depressed as a result.  Offering some hope was the biometric work coming from Galton’s labo- ratory, often helped by two mathematicians who came to the monthly   dinners, Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. Whitehead and Russell  were then preparing their monumental Principia Mathematica, but they  did not find any parameters from Lankester’s descriptive biology to fit   into their quantitative methods. Russell was confident that eventually he would understand evo- lutionary biology objectively. He expected a clear beginning and end  that could be joined together using mathematical equations. He saw all  knowledge as a single language of science, leading to a single truth, a  Law of Life being verifiable by experiments and expressed in numbers.  The older naturalists such as Lankester and Alfred Wallace did not accept  that life could be described using equations, and they ridiculed the link   the mathematicians were making to philosophy.  In Cambridge, William Bateson was determined to find experimen-  tal support for inheritance. He had never been impressed by the appar- ently random lottery of competition at the centre of Darwin’s creed, and  he could see no evidence either for the units of inheritance being parti- cles (or what we now call genes). Instead, he had a theory that hereditary  information was transmitted by sound waves or other vibrations. There  was no positive evidence for this, either, and Bateson looked in vain for  some kind of experimental verification.  In London, and with equal determination, Francis Galton and Karl  Pearson were still analysing the data they had collected over the years  about health and family backgrounds. Neither the genetic nor the biom- etric approach had any new explanations for how life works. All that the  two groups were able to agree on was to monitor breeding patterns in  experimental animals and plants. Galton, Pearson and Weldon wanted   to extend their experiments to humans. Support for this approach came   from Russell who was already applying Pearson’s statistical reasoning  a new Breed of BIologIst,  1900–10 89 </page> <page sequence="4"> 90 and the principles of Galton’s law of ancestral heredity. Russell advo- cated social action with direct payments from the state to ‘desirable’  parents, while the poor sections of society, those who reproduced much  faster than the wealthy, got nothing. Lankester’s reaction to Russell’s scheme is not recorded, though the  rift did highlight a growing split between biologists who measured and  those who observed. While Russell was all for measurement, Lankester  insisted that both were necessary, and for a time the two stayed in   their separate corners. Along with Whitehead, Russell advocated three  requirements to explain the history of life: a concept of infinity, the flex- ibility of choice and the desire to reduce explanations to the smallest  component. They argued that this hard and optimistic programme raised  the stakes for biologists by pushing qualitative description to one side in   favour of biometrics. *** Then, early in the new century, there was an important advance from an  unexpected discovery, and it led to the creation of the discipline soon to   be called ‘genetics’. Early in the morning of 8 May 1900, the forty-y ear-  old William Bateson caught the train from Cambridge to London. On the  journey Bateson happened to turn to some papers that he’d bundled into  his bag, and there he found an unread reprint of an article published   thirty- four years earlier. The article, by a monk called Gregor Mendel,  discussed the inherited characteristics of peas over several generations.  Bateson found it fascinating. From Liverpool Street Station, his taxi drove  through the dirty Bloomsbury streets, and he realised that he had just  made an important discovery. Some of the biologists and medics who  worked nearby would also have understood the contents of that obscure  article had they known of it, but he was going to claim the realisation for  himself. Bateson, then a fellow of St John’s College, had been invited   to give a lecture to the Royal Horticultural Society in Chelsea about  ‘Galton’s Law’. The lecture he had prepared was based on the conclu- sions of a recent analysis of the white and yellow patches on Basset  hounds that suggested that parents contributed equally to their off-  spring’s inherited matter. However, here was the earlier work by  Mendel that showed a different kind of pattern from one generation  to the other, a more complex mix than the expected 1:1 ratio. Legend  has it that Bateson changed the topic of his lecture to share Mendel’s  work with his audience at the Chelsea Society. He began with a predic- tion: ‘The Laws of Heredity will probably work more changes in man’s  90 BlooMsBury sCIentIsts </page> <page sequence="5"> 91 outlook on the world, and in his power over nature, than any other    advance in natural knowledge that can be foreseen.’3 The audience  remained silent, unaware of the importance of Mendel’s pea-b reeding  experiments, let alone why such dull work should be presented with  excitement. It was an uncanny repeat of the silence after the Darwin   and Wallace paper that had been read out to the Linnean Society forty-  two years earlier. Wanting to share his discovery further, Bateson  alerted Galton to the manuscript:  ‘Mendel’s work seems to me one  of the most remarkable investigations yet made on heredity, and it is    extraordinary that it should have got forgotten.’4 Like the audience in  Chelsea, Galton did not respond, and it took several years for him to  appreciate the significance of Mendel’s work. To be fair, it was easy to  miss the point of Mendel’s obscure experiments. For the uninitiated –  that is, the vast majority – the changing shapes of peas from one gen- eration to another were hard to associate with the search for Darwin’s   missing units of inheritance. With no one showing any interest in his rediscovery, Bateson was  left feeling that he had overvalued Mendel’s article and that his own the- ories were better after all. Six years previously, he had first suggested that  hereditary features were transmitted by vibrations rather than by dis- crete particles, and he had become so preoccupied with his own hypoth- esis that he preferred to dismiss all other explanations of evolution out  of hand. He summarised Darwin in one line: ‘Selection is a true phenom-   enon; but its function is to select, not to create.’5 He was convinced that  Darwin had got it wrong. He thought the London group who surrounded  Galton and Pearson, and who seemed to do nothing but analyse data,  were no better. After all, there was still a possibility that vibrating mes- sages would show Mendelian ratios and that he had been right to get   excited about discovering the manuscript. He claimed further support  from mainland Europe where the prominent botanist Hugo de Vries was   finding evidence that mutation could explain hereditary change; de Vries  had even found evidence that one species could split into two. These big  and sudden evolutionary changes were much more dramatic than any-  thing Darwin had anticipated in his vision of a world of gradual change. Through the 1890s, relations between Weldon and Bateson had  become frosty, but the real target of Cambridge’s distaste for UCL was   more likely to have been Karl Pearson. One of Weldon’s friends was a   mathematics student called John Maynard Keynes, and he began to ques- tion the usefulness and truthfulness of statistics, especially to help under- stand the readily available data from economics. He was concerned by  some of Pearson’s conclusions about social issues and asked whether  a new Breed of BIologIst,  1900–10 91 </page> <page sequence="6"> 92 ‘alcoholic homes exert in general an evil environmental influence upon  children, and if they could be investigated only by experimental, not sta-   tistical, methods’.6  Many other people grappling with genetics also quarrelled with  Pearson’s emphasis on statistics. They were not happy about taking data  from just one or two variables and assuming that ‘all other things remain  equal’. It was a problem for all scientific analysis: how to keep everything  else constant out of the experiment, when just one thing is being consid-  ered. For instance, Keynes’s example of the social problem of alcoholism  was mixed up with the political ambitions of the temperance lobby on  one hand and the eugenics lobby on the other. It could never be analysed  statistically in isolation to give a clear picture. Such interpretation of data  could never be entirely objective. To show the importance of subjective interpretations, Keynes  asked an apparently simple question:  ‘Do you expect it to rain today?’  The answer depended on interpretation. Did the question mean:  Is it  more likely to rain than not? Is it less likely? Is it as likely? His point was  that there were many alternative approaches to such an apparently sim- ple question, but he did have a very simple answer: ‘Take an umbrella.’  This was a way of arguing about uncertainty that set Keynes apart from   most of his friends. At the Saturday meetings of the Apostles, his youthful   hero George Moore spent much time separating a person’s innate good- ness from his or her outer actions. Keynes asked whether without some  Christian or Victorian standard, what sanction does an individual have  to say what is good or not good? There was always variation in the pas- sion of the human heart, in the pattern of life among communities, what    Keynes called the ‘powerful and valuable springs of feeling’.7 He had  outlined these concerns to the Apostles at one of their meetings in 1904  when he was looking for a scientific basis to morals, wanting to challenge  Moore’s Victorian utilitarian concept of goodness, but at that time he had  not had the clarity or confidence to go public. It was to take him another  sixteen years to publish these ideas in one of his most important books,   Treatise on Probability, published in 1921.  Bateson shared Keynes’s scepticism of statistics and saw no good  coming from such an analysis. Instead he emphasised that mutation  caused evolution which, in turn, could lead to a single species split- ting into two. In his 1894 Materials for the Study of Variation he had  explained this ‘discontinuous evolution’ in detail. Materials gave no place  at all to environmental influences and concentrated instead on Bateson’s  own untested theory of evolution by vibrations. At that time, no one in   Cambridge gave much attention to Darwin’s ideas on natural selection,  92 BlooMsBury sCIentIsts </page> <page sequence="7"> 93  until Alfred Wallace was asked to review Bateson’s Materials. The review  was very critical of Bateson’s work, especially his vibration theory for  which there was no direct evidence. The day after that review appeared   Wallace met with Weldon in London, and they talked about Bateson’s  dismissal of many of the ideas that Darwin had cherished. Wallace  and Weldon went away intent on going public with more criticisms of  Bateson’s biased approach. In 1895, they both wrote critically of Bateson  in the Fortnightly Review. This put what had been a strong friendship  at Cambridge between Bateson and Weldon under considerable strain.   Worse, Galton continued to support Bateson’s book because he thought   it added to the cause of his own polyhedron model. Galton had never  really accepted Darwin’s insistence that evolution proceeds at a slow and  constant rate; he was always looking for support for the idea that evolu- tion moved in steps. Another battle in the war between Bloomsbury and Cambridge  began harmlessly enough. One of the increasingly rare defenders of  mainstream Victorian values, and a continuing supporter of Darwin in   particular, was Sir William Thistleton-D yer, the director of Kew Gardens  between 1885 and 1905. Dyer thought that evolution led to distinct and  stable species across all communities, and therefore agreed with Weldon  about Bateson’s neglect of outside influences on evolution. Dyer had  made the same point in 1895 when he suggested that different coloured  varieties of the ornamental flowering plant Cineraria were hybrids and  not random mutants. He observed that the different colours formed  gradually not suddenly. Whether this meant that they were not mutants  was not very clear then. Dyer’s support for gradualism attracted the   wrath of Bateson in the correspondence columns of Nature, and Weldon  soon joined in. Bateson took the criticism personally, and from then on  his Cambridge group, which was studying mutations in what became  Mendelian Genetics, felt they were distinct from the London school of  statistical biometrics. The differences between the two sides were clear. In London,   Pearson, Weldon and Wallace continued to support ideas set out by  Charles Darwin in On the Origin of Species. They believed that the major   mechanism of evolutionary change was competition by natural selec-  tion. This was stimulated when environments changed and usually hap- pened gradually within populations. In their view, this explained why  evolutionary change was hard to spot and why large amounts of data  from accurate observation were necessary before statistical analysis  could show new groups emerging and old ones becoming extinct. In  Cambridge, on the other hand, none of this was thought to be important.  a new Breed of BIologIst,  1900–10 93 </page> <page sequence="8"> 94  For the Cambridge men, new species originated by sudden mutations at  the genetic level and evolution was driven by processes deep inside the  cells and at that time unknown. Despite the attempts of Wallace and Weldon to bring Darwin’s work  into their discussions with biologists, the last few years of the nineteenth   century had seen further decline in support for natural selection. Those  who opposed Darwin’s theories were encouraged by Bateson’s argu-  ments and the continuing absence of evidence for adaptation. Galton  worried that he might die before the elusive agent of heredity was discov- ered. He was kept going by the popularity of Galton’s Law which derived  from his work on the pedigree of the basset hounds. In this he used new  data to establish the distribution of each parent’s contribution going  back four and more generations. Pearson, overjoyed with such good data  for analysis, described the patterns of inheritance for the white and yel-  low patches with a series of new equations. To cheer up Galton, Pearson   incorporated these into a Happy New Year card. Galton’s warm response  gave all the London biometricians a new lease of life for the next battle   with Cambridge.  That battle came in 1901, sooner than they expected. Bateson was  the referee of a manuscript setting out Pearson’s equations. Unfortunately,  although the mathematics in the article may have been good, the biology  was bad. Bateson admitted to not understanding mathematics, yet he  took great delight in rejecting the manuscript. This angered the London  group who decided to begin a journal of their own for such articles that  crossed the boundaries of traditional disciplines. They called the journal  Biometrika, which is still publishing high- quality work today. The arguments about analysing data and distinguishing mutants   continued unabated until Weldon’s sudden death in 1906 at the age of   forty- six. After that, some of the fighting spirit left Pearson, allowing   Bateson to get on with supporting Mendel’s ideas, while quietly keep-  ing an eye out for evidence for his own vibration theory. Pearson was so  disturbed by Weldon’s death that he settled into a quieter way of life to  concentrate on such projects as writing Galton’s biography, but he also  wanted to spend more time talking at conferences and promoting eugen-  ics. Later, George Bernard Shaw, who admired Pearson’s work, said:  ‘When I get my hand in sufficiently I think I will write Karl Pearson, a    Tragedy. Can anything be done to rescue you from your professorship?’8   Pearson was driven, at the expense of everything else, by the idea of  achieving objectivity. He had discarded his earlier ideas as being too sub- jective. Shaw said that he had also felt the same temptation to study too   many things and in the end settled for writing plays. 94 BlooMsBury sCIentIsts </page> <page sequence="9"> 95 By 1907, Pearson was bemoaning his grand ambitions and pro- nouncing his career a failure:  ‘Twenty years hence a curve or a symbol  will be called “Pearson’s” &amp; nothing more remembered of the toil of the    years.’9 Maybe this was the part of Pearson’s life that Shaw regarded as  tragic:  the difficulty they both had in reconciling their socialist beliefs  with their narcissistic enthusiasm for study. The same dilemma was to  become a familiar feature in the lives of several Bloomsbury scientists  and artists. Most of them were afraid of change, especially that repre- sented by the new technology. Although Pearson wanted change, he was  content to sulk with his mechanical Brunsviga calculating machine and  to become even more distant until he eventually retired at seventy- seven. There is no doubt that at the peak of his working life in the mid- dle of the 1900s, Pearson did succeed in highlighting the importance   of experiment in biology. Galton, meanwhile, had been productive in  encouraging his students to gather large data sets for statistical analysis,  and it led to an interest in patterns and clues about evolution from many   different kinds of new sources. ***  Since his schooldays in Regent Square, Tansley had seen great social  change in Bloomsbury, much of it brought about by scientific and tech-  nological advances. H. G. Wells had also been aware of this transition  and by 1905 had become involved with several political groups connect- ing genetics, ecology and political science. The relationship between  these three new fields was a central theme in his popular novels. He was  aware that in the 1900s the political classes were increasingly turning   towards the Fabian cause. Founded in 1884, the Fabians were a largely   middle- class pressure group that advanced the principles of socialism.   The Fabians followed the style of Fabius Maximus, who had been nick- named ‘the Delayer’ in ancient Rome, slowly wearing down the enemy  with peaceful tactics such as cutting off the supply of weapons. The new group gained support from many influential Bloomsbury  thinkers. To stimulate more ideas, its founders, Beatrice and Sydney   Webb, started a monthly dining club called the Coefficients. Members  included familiar intellectual characters such as the physiologist R. B.  Haldane, Bertrand Russell, George Bernard Shaw, John Maynard Keynes  and H. G. Wells. How small the social and professional circles were in  Bloomsbury in those days! In both the arts and the sciences the same  people asked the same questions. Most of those involved still had the view  that science was leading to some kind of utopia, while still not accepting   that religion and evolution might be quite separate matters. a new Breed of BIologIst,  1900–10 95 </page> <page sequence="10"> 96  By 1905, H. G. Wells was a famous figure throughout the English-  speaking world. His main goal was to link the compatible methodologies  of science and politics, and he was to do it slowly and peacefully through  the Fabians. There seemed to be something inevitable about politics  and science coming together as both were concerned with the same  questions:  population, social class and socialism. Wells explored these  issues in his fiction. He was supported by his new friend, Lankester, who  also believed that the mission of twentieth-c entury science was to bring  together the common themes of genetics, ecology and political science.  Wells’s scientific training meant that, for him, everything had a purpose;  if an answer was doubtful then he used his intelligence to manipulate a  useful outcome. If there were no outcome, the analysis was discarded.  For him, unlike for his friend Henry James, there was no beauty or art  for its own sake, no time to reflect and ponder a scene for its atmosphere.   The different perspectives of Wells and James caused the two men to  engage in many heated discussions about writing and style. At first these  arguments increased their admiration for one another’s work, but their   differences were so great that their friendship eventually had to break. Wells struggled with his own anger about his background and about  the privilege of those he emulated. His reputation, wit and confidence  made him attractive to women, and he liked to play dangerously and have  regular affairs. One was with Amber Reeves, the daughter of the director  of the London School of Economics and Political Science. Moreover, in his  1909 novel Ann Veronica, he teased her publicly by writing: ‘All the world  about her seemed to be – how can one put it? – in wrappers, like a house    when people leave it in the summer.’10 Wells put immense pressure on his  protagonist Ann, and his mistress Amber, to leave the rigid social habits  that had emerged during Victoria’s reign, to get away from a society still  largely dominated by social discrimination and inequality of opportunity.  The critic John St Loe Strachey wrote in The Spectator that the book was   capable of spoiling the minds that read it. Predictably, Beatrice Webb, the  rather prim founder of the Fabians, was quietly upset.  George Bernard Shaw also lectured to the Fabians, and, by 1903,  he was convinced that science would be a major force in the future. Ever  since the 1885 party when he joked about Weismann’s tails, Shaw had  been unhappy with Darwin’s ideas and was searching for another way to  explain evolution. Now he had one that linked to the ideas of the Fabian  movement. In 1903, he wrote Man and Superman, which set out his  campaign that eugenics and socialism could become entwined to give a  promising future for distant generations. He also thought that a broader  overview was needed not only to explain biological diversity but also the  96 BlooMsBury sCIentIsts </page> <page sequence="11"> 97 beauty of things such as Mozart’s and Beethoven’s music. Shaw and the   Fabians had no doubt that the greatest biologist had been Darwin him- self: it was his interpretation that Shaw didn’t like. Yet, throughout the  1890s, no one else with an holistic approach like Darwin’s had made any   breakthroughs. Even the theory of natural selection fell into neglect. However, Shaw also shared the idea, so popular at the time, that  human destiny would be determined by natural creative impulses rather  than by biological advances. It was what many thought of as the life   force, what Henri Bergson the French philosopher, called ‘creative evo-  lution’. Men such as John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, Wagner and St  Francis had tried to envision their own utopias, but Shaw had his own  view: modern humans, he believed, could never obtain that state proph- esised by Nietzsche. Instead, humans needed to assume that in the future  our species would evolve into a particular kind of superman. This, in turn,  would lead to the socialisation of the means of production and exchange,  a positivist’s dream of moralising the capitalist and an ethicist’s dream of   putting codes and lessons on a man as a harness is put on a horse. Several other anti-s cience activists were busy in Edwardian Britain.   In 1903, an anti-v ivisectionist called Stephen Coleridge heard a rumour   that the well- known UCL physiologist Ernest Starling was regularly per- forming experiments on a dog without even the most basic anaesthetic.  The newspapers discovered that Professor Starling was indeed in charge  of a research programme into diabetes and pancreatitis, and the work  was being done by a wealthy student called William Bayliss. Denying the  accusation, and having good evidence that the rumour was incorrect,  Starling encouraged Bayliss to bring a libel case against Coleridge, and  they won damages of £2,000. In response, the anti- vivisectionists raised money for a statue of the  so-c alled Brown Dog in Battersea Park, close to the dog’s home. It had an  inscription ‘Men and Women of England – how long shall these things  be?’ The case and the statue became legendary for UCL students, proud  that their college defended safe scientific research, and they regularly  paid homage to the statue, but it was quietly taken down in 1907. Another man who hated the idea of being ‘crushed out’ by sci-  ence and machines was another Cambridge Apostle, E. M. Forster, even  though he admitted that machines might help man ‘get a new and per-   haps a greater soul for the new condition’.11 However, on the whole, sci- ence was all too much for Forster, and he feared its power. In 1908, he  was spending increasing amounts of time in Bloomsbury teaching at the  Working Men’s College just around the corner from his gay friend Hugh  Meredith’s lodgings in Guilford Street. In one of his classes, he turned  a new Breed of BIologIst,  1900–10 97 </page> <page sequence="12"> 98 the novelty of early aeroplane flight into ‘anthropomorphic theology up  in the sky’, an idea that became a short story, ‘The Machine Stops’, about  a man escaping to the surface of the earth for a day. For Forster this was   only a brief encounter with science, but an important one. *** In 1908, there was an outstanding opportunity at UCL to see the influence   of art and science, the one on the other. Gwen Darwin (later Raverat)  was Charles Darwin’s granddaughter and was learning her skills as a   wood- engraver at the Slade School that year. At the same time, Agnes   Arber was finishing off her postgraduate work in the botany department,  on leaf development and morphology. How did talented women such as  these make out as ambitious artists and scientists? Did art triumph over  science? How were they bullied by men? There is little evidence easily  available, but the playing field doesn’t look level. Although they worked in the same building, there is no record of their  friendship there or through their early widowhoods later in Cambridge,  but it would be surprising if they had not known one another. In her 1952   childhood memoir, Period Piece, Raverat wrote about a strong sense of  guilt during her student days. Soon afterwards, there were comparable   accounts of Arber’s bad relationship with her supervisor, Professor Sir  Albert Seward, where the lack of support for her research suggested that  she, also, had been a victim of discrimination.  Later, in 1908, Adrian and Virginia Stephen invited Gwen to tea in   their home at 29 Fitzroy Square. Coldly, they asked why Gwen was an    artist, and, rather tensely, she replied, ‘Because I have got to be.’12 Later,  Virginia reflected how they had jeered at the scientific thoroughness with  which Gwen had taken to art. Gwen and her husband Jacques Raverat  called themselves neo- pagans, enjoying an outdoor life with daisy  chains, long country walks and talk of their young generation supporting  Fabianism. It was normal for women to react to bullying in this way, and it  was common for much of their talent to be wasted. Less commonly, both  these women, one a scientist, the other an artist, showed very similar cre-  ative talent that was not entirely wasted. From Raverat there are wood-   cuts and Period Piece. Agnes Arber was balancing nature and philosophy.  She argued that the use of pictorial imagery in thinking is a fundamental  need of the human mind: in biology you only really look when you draw.  Both women gave particular attention to structure and function, with a  view of nature through their own eyes and interpretations of its images  in their own minds. By different means, they both found unique ways  98 BlooMsBury sCIentIsts </page> <page sequence="13"> 99 of sharing the information and understanding its beauty and meaning.   Arber’s 1953 legacy, The Mind and the Eye, is another classic memorial of  how she so cleverly interpreted what she saw.  The Slade School at University College was a major centre of  English art, and there was a natural rivalry between several groups of   painters. A  leader of one of these was Walter Sickert, who had been  strongly influenced by the French impressionists and had moved away  from trying to idealise the nature that he saw all around him. Artists were  no longer recording something just because it existed; rather, they were   being selective and using increasingly abstract styles. Sickert had been  taught the science of colour by Lucien Pissarro, the son of the well-k nown  French artist, who was living in London. They met at 19 Fitzroy Street on  Saturday mornings in the summer of 1908 to work together. It was in that part of Bloomsbury that the middle class from  Kensington had invaded and introduced fashionable alternatives to the  old traditions. However, other artists wanted to replace that romanti- cism with reality. Artists such as Spencer Gore, Charles Ginner and   Harold Gilman attended Walter Sickert’s weekend workshop and  painted vulnerable women lying motionless on squalid iron bedsteads,  stern landladies and gas stoves; they were sad observers of the social   divide in English society. Social class was a major theme for the Camden  Town group also. In 1911, the group elected sixteen members includ- ing Augustus John, Duncan Grant and Wyndham Lewis. The pictures  painted by these men often brought together groups that traditionally  avoided one another: for instance, working- class men and women could  be seen associating with upper- middle-c lass intellectuals. The pictures  were not the usual romantic idealisation but instead they were strongly  unsettling. Separately it seemed as though something awful was always  about to happen. These were expressions of the same fear of sexual  pleasure that Marie Stopes was thinking about from a biological as well  as a social angle. The Camden Town group took subjects that were clearly part of the  local lifestyles and painted them without regard to personal feelings. It  was similar to the split in Lankester’s world of biology: one side hang- ing on to the beauty of nature’s complex environment, the other one  measuring the details inside each cell. The Camden Town artists did not  allow emotions to cloud their objective views of nature, and, much like  the local scientists, they left their personal warmth for their family. The  subjects were cold and withdrawn, making no effort to connect with their  fellow humans. Their pictures of degenerate life so close to Bloomsbury  teased the public’s imagination in a similar way to H. G. Wells’s The Time  a new Breed of BIologIst,  1900–10 99 </page> <page sequence="14"> 100 Machine. They played on people’s fear about where society might be   going without the control of a Victorian moral structure.  When Lankester first read Wells’s The Time Machine, he didn’t know  that the author had been one of the students whose work he had failed  in the second- year examinations. Equally, few of Wells’s readers were  aware that Lankester had written a book about degeneration, though  they were certainly fascinated by what sounded very different to the   popular view of evolution:  regression and decline. These ambiguities  were to stimulate many of the forthcoming problems of the new century,  such as what to do about homosexuality, dandyism, mysticism and natur- ism, all of which were coming into vogue as though manifestations of a  degenerate society. Turning the African into the cultured European was  considered progress, but degeneration suggested that things could go the  other way as well. Was the loss of mental and physical control part of the   evolutionary process? As Wells’s traveller says in The Time Machine: ‘the  too- perfect security of the Upper- Worlders had led them to a slow move- ment of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength and intel-    ligence’.13 But what was to be done? Science and art were preoccupied with the same set of questions   about human evolution. Since race and social class seemed to be mere  stages in that change, maybe science could help it advance and prevent it  going backwards. That was the intention of those who advocated eugenic   research. Proponents of eugenics agreed that the ideas needed more  thought in order to eliminate the obvious dangers. Wells and Lankester  knew one another well by 1906 and must have talked through the argu- ments together.  Lankester, Wells and Fry were respectful of the part played by art   in science and used that link to understand the whole of nature and the  interactions of its internal and external parts. The new generation under- stood enough from the past to be open to the world and to express feel-  ings about their position in it. One example was the new biology that was  beginning to explain sex and inheritance, ecology and altruism. Young  people of Virginia Stephen’s generation were angry that their parents  couldn’t relax their Victorian yoke about that and many other issues. These Bloomsbury pioneers were now a distinct group, without  organisation but with plenty of influence on one another and on their  generation. They were all looking forward to very different styles of liv- ing. The group included writers and artists as well as scientists – people  regarded now as specialists  – but, in Edwardian times, they were the  intelligentsias without further subdivision. (The English have never felt  comfortable describing such people as intellectuals.)

During the same  decade, the group’s identity became distinct from their more focused  adversaries in Cambridge. The success of science education encouraged an increasing num- ber of people to challenge their religious belief. Looking further ahead,   people such as Russell and Keynes were also asking whether the natu- ral sciences, and biology in particular, might one day be able to explain  everything scientifically. They understood that social and political affairs  were often conducted irrationally and asked how scientific reasoning  would ever be used in that kind of political sphere. The new popular   movements of socialism and eugenics were about to put their fears and  joys to the test. a new Breed of BIologIst,  1900–10 101 </page> </plain_text>
