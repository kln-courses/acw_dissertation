<plain_text><page sequence="1">BREAKING BOUNDARIES Rosemary Ruether, Women-Church: Theology and Practice. New York: Harper 8c Row, San Francisco, 1985. At the risk of sounding ageist and sexist, as a 53-year-old woman, I think I am in a privileged posidon to critique Rosemary Radford Ruether's Women-Church: The ology &amp; Practice. Years spent struggling to maintain my integrity in a patriarchal institution, still more years spent studying a male-defined theology, have prepared me to appreciate the profound contribution Reuther has made to her sisters and brothers who are in the process of becoming Church. The author strikes one familiar chord after the other, evoking the cognitive dis sonance of a male-dominated institution. But the real achievement of this book is that it explores alternative harmonious chords, spirited and suggestive. For in stance, the Church is not seen as some sacred sphere separated from society and pointed toward heaven; it exists . . where the Word of God is preached as the denunciation of social evil and the annunciation of an alternative possibility of jus tice, and where people are motivated and empowered to enter this struggle in soli darity with the most victimized sectors of the society." Ruether's is no ivory tower theology, but takes place in the concrete context of social engagement. Persons involved in communities committed to justice enjoy a 'hermeneutical privilege' when they come together to read scripture. Τ ο substanti ate this point the author avails herself of the research available in a doctoral disser tation done by Kate Pravera in 1984 on "The Primacy of Orthopraxis: Theological Method in the Nicaraguan Church of the Poor." In Nicaragua, Basic Christian Communities inspired by Liberation Theology have demonstrated the revolution ary potential of the Church in action. According to Fernando Cardenal (the Nica raguan Minister of Education who was forced to leave the Jesuit order) the conflict between conservative hierarchy and the church of the poor reflects the class strug gle in society. Ruether clearly states the basic assumption of the book: "The church cannot be defined only as historical institution or only as spirit-filled community. Rather the church exists as a dialectical interaction between the two elements." Ruether is criti cal of the historical institution when it claims to be the cause of grace rather than the occasion and context where grace or the dispensation of the Spirit may occur. She lays bare the basic legitimizing myth behind the theological concepts of 'ex opere operato' and apostolic succession, by means of which the historic church claims to control the mediation of the Spirit. The question of whether feminist basic communities have a future in the church is honestly considered. Ruether offers no pat answers; instead, she exhibits a great 362 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="2">reverence for diversity within the feminist religious spectrum. She holds out the possibility of creative dialogue between Christian groups and prominent pre biblical and post-biblical feminists such as Starhawk and Mary Daly. Her own posi tion in relation to the church is clearest when she says, "One must learn to make creative use of existing institutions without being stifled or controlled by them." Another key question is raised in the chapter on "The Ecclesia of Patriarchy and Male Exodus Communities": why hasn't the prophetic tradition ever been applied to the critique of patriarchy? Her answer is short and sweet: women did not control the definition of prophetic tradition. The memory of their participation in the Exo dus and prophetic tradition was consistently blotted out or reinterpreted according to the interests of a patriarchal culture. One startling example of this is in Exodus 19:14-15, where Moses tells the "people" that in order to prepare for the revela tion of the covenant, they must not go near any woman! "Women are not only invis ible, but they are also seen as sources of pollution inimical to the receiving of divine revelation." Rejection of female sexuality ultimately defines the sacredness of males. The relation of liberation theology to feminism is carefully studied. The wom en's movement is often looked upon with ambivalence if not hostility by Third World movements, considered something of a distraction to the real business of class revolution. A reflection of this attitude can be detected in the work of some black and Third World male liberation theologians who, in defining liberation, are not sure that feminism is really essential. Black and Third World women have spo ken with authority to this issue. Just as the voice of the poor has been described as the explosion of consciousness within theology, so the protest of women has been described by Mercy Oduyoye as the "explosion within the explosion." To the casual glance, the title of this book Women-Church, might signal separa tism. The more I read and reflected, however, the more I understood the necessity of distinguishing, at least for the time being, women-church from the ecclesia of patriarchy. Ruether describes this necessary distinction as a stage in the process. Not to take the time to delegitimize theological myths or to dismantle clericalism would be to short-circuit the process and to leave a misogynist, hierarchical priest hood intact. Besides, the idea of women-church resonates with my own strong feeling about the need to name the feminine in God before we neuter Her. It seems precipitous to go from a 4000 year old tradition of a male God to a gender-free deity. This is not to be anthropomorphic but simply to affirm a historical need for equal time in which women can appreciate their own image in the Divine. A major part of this book is about the development of feminist liturgies, rituals full of wisdom and compassion. They focus on four different areas: the formation of church as a community of liberation from patriarchy and all oppression ; healing from particular occasions of violence and crisis; rites of the life cycle; and finally seasonal celebrations. The liturgies are inclusive of the different layers of the Medi terranean and Western religious traditions: nonbiblical ancient Near Eastern tradi tion; Jewish tradition; and Christian tradition. They are inclusive as well of the height, depth and breadth of human experience. In women-church there are rites of healing: from abortion, from a miscarriage or a stillbirth; from wife-battering. There are rites to celebrate puberty for a young woman and coming-out for a les bian, to prepare for birthing and to celebrate menopause. A fitting conclusion for the book is a Hiroshima Memorial Day service (August 6th) that draws on the work FALL 1986 363</page><page sequence="3">of Ernesto Cardenal and Jonathan Schell and holds out the possibility of rising up to cleanse the earth of nuclear weapons. Rosemary Ruether's brilliance, stamina and endurance remind me of the Syro Phoenician woman who refused to accept Jesus preliminary rejection which seemed to restrict aid to the children of Israel: "Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." (Mk 7:29) Ruether shatters the patriarchialism of a church that has excluded women from everything but cleaning up around the master's table.
