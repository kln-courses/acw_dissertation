<plain_text><page sequence="1">Siren and Artist: Contradiction in Thackeray's Aesthetic Ideal JUDITH LAW FISHER 6TsA C K E R A Y chose for the original wrap- per of The History of Pendennis (1848), his most autobiographical novel, a Victorian version of the Choice of Hercules.' His contemporaries would have recognized the tra- ditional motif of man forced to choose between Pleasure (the siren) and Duty (wife and children) and would have understood the al- lusion to Thackeray's original siren, Becky Sharp. But this meta- phor acquired deeper significance for Thackeray. Not only do the two paths represent sexual choices but their relative moral values are indicated by the composition of the engraving. Demure Duty clings to Pen, church in the background on the right, traditionally the "good" side of a painting,2 while on the other side the sinuous ? 1985 by The Regents of the University of California 'The Choice of Hercules was a standard moral emblem derived from the myth originated by the Greek Sophist Prodicus. Thackeray had a good example of the subject in Raphael's Vision of a Knight, acquired by the National Gallery on 8 March 1847. Ronald Paulson calls Prodicus' Choice of Hercules one of the "basic school texts" for "verbalizing the visual and visualizing the verbal" in English art (Emblem and Expression: Meaning in English Art of the Eighteenth Century [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1975], p. 30). See also Martin Meisel, Realizations: Narrative, Pictorial, and Theatrical Arts in Nineteenth-Century England (Princeton: Princeton Univ.

The wrapper of Pendennis is an allusion to Sir Joshua Reynolds' painting Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy (1761). Thackeray's adaptation of this motif emphasizes the importance for him of the double nature of the dichotomy. As Martin Meisel points out, Thackeray's version "restores the moral opposition be- tween Virtue and Pleasure," which Reynolds' painting almost ig- nores. The Christianized context indicated by the church and the horned imps defines Pleasure as "Vice." Moreover, according to Meisel, the allusion to Reynolds' painting enables Thackeray's de- sign to retain "the implications of an aesthetic rivalry."3 The sexual decision is also a choice between ambitions: does one sacrifice one- self for family and society or does one satisfy one's private, selfish desires for personal greatness? For Thackeray this choice between life-styles had a personal meaning; the siren and the wife signify an artistic dilemma that plagued the author all his life and in fact contributed to the formal weakness so often noted in The Virginians and The Adventures of Philip.4 Arthur Pendennis and Clive Newcome play out on paper Thackeray's dilemma: the artist's private ambition to create great art confronting the necessity to adapt to, but not give in to, the marketplace. Their struggle is complicated by the necessity to admit their own mediocrity as artists. As part of their growing self-knowl- edge, they consciously reject the sirens in favor of a domestically inclined "lady"; for example, Pen accepts Laura Bell as his good angel, "awe-stricken in the contemplation of her sweet goodness and purity,"5 and Clive acknowledges defeat in his pursuit of Ethel 3Realizations, p. 327. 4Gordon N. Ray, Thackeray: The Age of Wisdom, 1847-1863 (1958; rpt. New York: Octagon Books, 1972), notes that The Virginians, Philip, and Lovel the Widower are the "most difficult to defend" of Thackeray's works (p. 371). Ray also said that The Virginians reached "an acme of formlessness" (p. 373). See the reviews of The Virginians and Philip in Thackeray: The Critical Heritage, ed. Geoffrey Tillotson and Donald Hawes (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1968), pp. 286-314.

All Thackeray's protagonists must recognize that both their aesthetic and sexual ideals are either un- attainable or false. Their alternative is what Thackeray called "that golden gift of mediocrity," which is "energetic," "respected," "pros- perous," and "honest," but is also "blundering" and "common- place."6 This description in "On Men and Pictures" (1841) is directed toward painters, yet it is remarkably anticipatory of the Philip Fir- min of 1861. Thackeray continually ridiculed would-be artists of the "sub- lime" such as Professor Gandish in The Newcomes practicing his "'Igh Art." "Pigmies. . . upon stilts," Thackeray called such artists in "On the French School of Painting."7 It is not the subject matter which Thackeray disdained; he admired artists capable of genuine sub- limity such as Michelangelo or Poussin. Gandish, however, repre- sents the "theatrical-heroic," or False Sublime, exemplified in Thackeray's art world by John Martin and Benjamin Robert Hay- don.8 The difference between truth and falsity (and this applies to all art) is whether the artist paints according to his or her natural inclination or whether he or she is only mimetic and simply imitates the external signs of a kind of art. While Michelangelo's art flowed from his genuine passion and genius, the Martins of the world relied on formulae, "Drury Lane tricks and claptraps,"9 and thus could produce only the semblance of sublime art. Most of his con- temporaries, Thackeray/Titmarsh felt, were not emotionally or in- tellectually capable of the genuine Sublime. Are we gods, Miltons, Michael Angelos, that can leave earth when we please, and soar away to heights immeasurable? No, my dear MacGilp; but the fools of academicians would fain make us so. Are you not, and half the painters in London, painting for an opportunity to shew your genius in a great "historical picture"?

Have you wings? Not a feather: and yet you must be ever puffing, sweating up to the tops of rugged hills; and arrived there, clapping and shaking your ragged elbows, and mak- ing as if you would fly! ("FSP," p. 685)10 It is necessary here to distinguish between the Sublime and the Ideal. Sublimity is a kind of effect produced by High Art, exemplified by Milton's Paradise Lost, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, or Shakespeare's tragedies. To feel sublime is to transcend the self. Thus a Sublime work of art is intellectually and emotionally larger than life. The "Ideal," as I use it, is a perfect "type," combining all the desirable qualities of a kind of art in just proportion. In the context of my argument, the protagonists see the sirens, rightly or wrongly, as Ideals of Sublimity. Thus if the Sublime is false, the resulting Ideal will also be false. This distinction between the gen- uine and false Ideal in art, defined by one's ability and one's sincerity in following that ability, connects the false and real "art" produced by the sirens (their appearances and their performances) to the false and real artistic ambitions and creations of the protagonists. Pendennis and Clive illustrate both the ridiculous and pathetic sides of vain artistic ambition-vain in two senses. Pen aspires to Goethean romance in Walter Lorraine and epic poetry in "Ariadne in Naxos." Clive paints grandiose historical paintings (rejected by the Royal Academy) such as The Battle of Assaye, so large that they have to be lowered through a window. To emphasize their showy ambitions Thackeray characterizes them as ornamental dandies, exuding scent, sporting glossy waistcoats and shiny patents, "a cus- tomer to tailors, a wearer of handsome rings, shirt-studs, musta- chios, long hair, and the like" (N, p. 243). These would-be great artists, Pen, Clive (and Henry Esmond) learn painfully that their artistic genius, if not a delusion, is at least exaggerated. Typically, Clive leaves off fancy sketches and historical pieces ... having convinced himself either that he had not an epic genius, or that to draw portraits of his friends was a much easier task than that which he had set himself formerly.... my art, Ethel, is not only my choice and my love, but my honour too. I shall never distinguish myself in it; I may take smart likenesses, but that is all." (N, pp. 478-79, 505) "0See also "On Men and Pictures," p. 107.</page><page sequence="6">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 397 Clive echoes Thackeray's desperate cry to Frank Stone in 1835: "As for myself-I am in a state of despair-I have got enough torn- up pictures to roast an ox by-the sun riseth upon my efforts and goeth down on my failures."" When Pen looks back upon Walter Lorraine, all he can see is the derivation and bombast in the novel that he had thought so eloquently testified to his passion for Emily Costigan: "[the novel] was of a very fierce, gloomy, and passionate sort,-the Byronic despair, the Wertherian despondency, the mock- ing bitterness of Mephistopheles.... How pompous some of the grand passages appeared; and how weak others were in which he thought he had expressed his full heart!" (P p. 399). Similarly, Henry Esmond's ambitions to be a great soldier and dramatist are inspired by his passion for Beatrix. To please her, "I tried to dis- tinguish myself as a soldier, and afterwards as a wit and a politician" (HE, p. 340). The crux of this side of the conflict is to know oneself-one has a duty to be what one is. Artists have the additional duty of educating the public by being the best artists they can honestly be. However, the temptation is great to prostitute oneself for the mar- ketplace by painting for profit or by writing (or, in the sirens' case, by acting) down to the public. To live in society as artists, Pen and Clive, by necessity, must adapt their aspirations to their limitations and earn a living by their work, catering to the public taste. In their endeavor to remain honest artists and still make a living by their art, Pen and Clive resemble the sirens who manipulate their physical appearance and manners as a painter uses paint and canvas and an actress uses her gestures and expression. Because the sirens are both artists and works of art, they are liable to two kinds of artistic corruption: creating for the wrong motives (the lure of the mar- ketplace) and being a false work of art (their appearance belying their personalities). However, the sirens are not simple equations between woman and Sublime art. While they all attempt to be Ideal, the nature of the Ideal is either a glittery, contrived "Beauty" or a more majestic "Sublime." Becky Sharp, Blanche Amory, Lady Maria, and Agnes Twysden make themselves compelling by their mannerisms, cos- tumes, and "stage sets," the novelists' equivalent to "Drury-Lane "The Letters and Private Papers of William Makepeace Thackeray, ed. Gordon N. Ray, 4 vols. (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1946), I, 279; hereafter cited in the text as Letters.</page><page sequence="7">398 NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION tricks." Beatrix Esmond, Ethel Newcome, and, to a lesser extent, Emily Costigan rely less on artifice because they have a natural grandeur. Becky is, of course, the classic artificial siren. She is a consum- mate actress, which in itself is a sign of her false art.'2 If a woman can act, she can dissemble, and Becky and Blanche make their way through the world by acting, which is dissembling because it pre- tends to reflect genuine emotion. Their behavioral formulae, in- cluding their "costumes," create the appearance of whatever inner state they wish to suggest. For instance, Becky insists upon acquiring "a moral shepherd's dog" for a companion, seeking to give herself the appearance of respectability (VF, pp. 362-63). When she is hunt- ing Jos Sedley, Becky plays the ingenue: "She was dressed in white, with bare shoulders as white as snow-the picture of youth, unpro- tected innocence, and humble virgin simplicity" (VF, p. 20; em- phasis added). To the artificially Ideal siren, appearance is all. Thus if Becky "did not wish to lead a virtuous life, at least she desired to enjoy a character for virtue" (VF, p. 461; emphasis added). Becky's and Blanche's theater extends to their carefully com- posed appearance; here drama and painting merge. Their class are living examples of the society beauties pictured in the Annuals, "coffee-table books" filled with schmaltzy, romantic poetry and sen- timentalized portraits, ridiculed by Thackeray because their con- trived imitation of nature debases the artist in the making of them. Nothing can be more false, poor, or meretricious, than the taste characteristic of these productions.... They are bad figures, badly painted, and drawn ... engraved in that mean, weak, conventional manner ... in which there is no force, breadth, texture, nor feel- ing of drawing; but only that paltry smoothness and effect which are the result of pure mechanical skill.'3 Becky epitomizes this contrived beauty in her heyday on Curzon Street, where Thackeray paints her picture as an "Annual beauty." There was a score of candles sparkling round the mantelpiece, in all sorts of quaint sconces, of gilt and bronze and porcelain. They lighted up Rebecca's figure to admiration, as she sate on a sofa "Meisel, Realizations, p. 333. 13"Our Annual Execution," Fraser's Magazine, 19 (1839), 58-59; hereafter cited in my text as "OAE."</page><page sequence="8">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 399 covered with a pattern of gaudy flowers. She was in a pink dress, that looked as fresh as a rose; her dazzling white arms and shoul- ders were half covered with a thin hazy scarf through which they sparkled; her hair hung in curls round her neck; one of her little feet peeped out from the fresh crisp folds of the silk: the prettiest little foot in the prettiest little sandal in the finest silk stocking in the world. (VF, p. 363) As always with Thackeray, the repeated diminutives signal irony, appropriate here, for this pink and white beauty has a voracious appetite for men and wealth, symbolized by her hideous fishtail underside, "diabolically" writhing down among her "wretched pick- led victims" (VF, pp. 624, 625). Becky's mechanical skill at arranging her portrait is emphasized by the theatrical lighting and careful composition of the scene. By way of contrast to Becky's manufactured brilliance, Amelia's genuine "pink and white" beauty underscores the cause-and-effect relation between sincerity in intent and truth in the art work. Ame- lia embodies the "namby-pamby" or "bread and butter" school of art Thackeray describes in "Picture Gossip" (pp. 716-17) and in the Pictorial Times. This art "is at least natural, which the heroic was not. Bread and butter can be digested by every man."''4 However, Thackeray's public advocacy of the kind of art that is healthy for all people conflicts with his private attraction for High Art, making his attitude decidedly ambivalent. While he admits the wholesome, purifying sentiment inspired by Frank Stone's Premier Pas ("PG," p. 717) or Charles Eastlake's Our Lord and the Little Children,'5 he loses patience at the similarly sentimental Governess by Richard Red- grave, cautioning his readers against "drivelling, hysterical senti- mentality" ("PG," pp. 716-17). Thackeray's ambivalence also surfaces in his treatment of Ame- lia. She purifies men by her very weakness (VF, p. 374), but her total vulnerability makes the Manager of the Performance impa- tient, even derisive at times (VF, esp. chs. 66, 67). In the context of this discussion, Amelia is most important insofar as her weakness, passivity, and naturalness make her a perfect foil for Becky's mach- inations. As opposed to Becky's brilliant costumes and perfor- "4"Letters on the Fine Arts, No. 3: The Royal Academy," Pictorial Times, 13 May 1843, p. 136.

Then, too, while Becky attracts rakes and debauchees such as Lord Steyne, Sir Pitt Crawley, and Rawdon himself, Amelia's vulnerability attracts only men without preten- sions, Dobbin, George in his better moments, and the mass of soldiers in their regiment who, like Ensign Stubble, are all "honest young fellows" (VF, p. 250). Finally, Amelia's appearance is the consequence of her own nature: "Her face blushed with rosy health, and her lips with the freshest of smiles, and she had a pair of eyes which sparkled with the brightest and honestest good-humour" (VF, p. 4). The "Ideal" Amelia embodies is the Domestic Ideal; she has no pretensions to being a siren and is never called so by the narrator. Although her passivity continually reminds the reader of Becky's energy and vivacity, her sincerity emphasizes the falsity of Becky's self-as-art role-playing. Less artificial but no less dangerous are the genuinely sublime sirens, Beatrix, Ethel, and, to a lesser extent, Emily Costigan and Fanny Bolton. Beatrix and Ethel in particular have imperious char- acters to match their beauty. All these women rely on their consid- erable natural beauty and sexual appeal and use little artifice. Ethel usually dresses in the simplest of white dresses, and Emily's acting (in contr-ast to Becky's vibrant Clytemnestra) consists of assuming statuesque poses. The common ground between the false and the genuine sirens completes their symbolism as Ideal art: they inspire the same response in men as does a Sublime work of art and embody the danger inherent in this response. According to Thackeray, sublimity in woman or in painting threatens its "audience" because it can distort perception, leading the viewer to see falsely or, even if one sees truly, to become ob- sessed, lose control. The sirens add a distinct sexual element to what is in the earlier art criticism already a sensual appreciation of art. In 1840 Thackeray described William Etty's nudes in his paint- ings as "beautiful syrens" and characterized his colors as "lus- cious. "16 In fact, Thackeray rejects the traditional sublime in his art "6"A Pictorial Rhapsody," Fraser's Magazine, 21 (1840), 732; hereafter cited in the text as "PR."</page><page sequence="10">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 401 criticism because of his own extreme response to it; he could not with comfort look at Delacroix' or Michelangelo's works despite his abstract admiration of them ("OMP," p. 111; "FSP," p. 682). Etty's Comus is "a classical and pictorial orgy ... a grand feast of sensual poetry.... a dream rather than a reality."'7 Such a response is potentially beyond the viewer's control. In an unconscious antici- pation of the cannibalistic siren, Thackeray, exploiting Titmarsh's tendency to exaggerate, compared looking at a Poussin to "drinking hot blood," asserting that "an ordinary man would be whirled away in a fever, or would hobble off this mortal stage in a premature gout-fit, if he too early or too often indulged in such tremendous drink" ("FSP," p. 688). The danger inherent in High Art exists because a true artist's images are totally absorbing. Turner's Fighting Teme'raire, for ex- ample, sends Michael Angelo Titmarsh into a patriotic fervor for an entire column of his review. Titmarsh's extravagance leads Thackeray to comment (on himself): '7"May Gambols; or, Titmarsh in the Picture-Galleries," Fraser's Magazine, 29 (1844), 706, 707; hereafter cited in the text as "MG." Thackeray, of course, was not alone in his preference for ordinary experience. George Eliot's digres- sion in chapter 17 of Adam Bede makes the same choice for "Dutch paintings"- that they are "faithful pictures of a monotonous homely existence," which she preferred over "cloud-borne angels . . . prophets, sibyls, and heroic warriors" (New York: New American Library, 1961). This aesthetic characteristic is dis- cussed as it pertains to nineteenth-century novelists generally in George Le- vine's "High and Low: Ruskin and the Novelists," in Nature and the Victorian Imagination, ed. U. C. Knoepflmacher and G. B. Tennyson (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1977), pp. 137-52. Since Levine concentrates on the sublime in nature, he finds little evidence that Thackeray was concerned with this problem; however, the emotions of the sublime apply equally to painting. Le- vine makes the point that Eliot, for one, feels that overexposure to "the heights" of landscape will render us unfit for daily life but that, "ironically," we must experience those heights if the lowlands are to be meaningful (p. 142). It is this irony which causes Thackeray's dilemma: how close can a moth come to a candle to learn of warmth but not get burned? Interestingly, most of Thack- eray's protagonists come too close; something vital is destroyed in Rawdon, Pen, Clive, and Henry. Thackeray's version of the metaphor as a union of art and sexuality increases the tension and gives the works, as the pattern is re- peated, a sense of obsession. Walter Scott's Waverley; or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since suggests such a connection. Edward Waverley is attracted to the darkly beautiful and passionate Flora Maclvor, who lives in the wild highlands, but marries the blond, ladylike Rose Bradwardine of the lowlands. Scott never really develops the sexual tensions, however, and the woman-as-art-work is incidental to Wav- erley. Scott's "picture" of Flora by the waterfall in chapter 22 (for which he apologized) is a decorative piece, whereas the siren metaphor based on the conflict between artistic power and artistic integrity is central to Thackeray's work.</page><page sequence="11">402 NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION It is absurd, you will say ... for Titmarsh, or any other Briton, to grow so politically enthusiastic about a four-foot canvass, rep- resenting a ship, a steamer, a river, and a sunset. But herein surely lies the power of the great artist. He makes you see and think of a great deal more than the objects before you; he knows how to soothe or to intoxicate, to fire or to depress, by a few notes, or forms, or colours, of which we cannot trace the effect to the source, but only acknowledge the power." ("SLFA," p. 744) Although in this context the artist's power is positive, it is still an absolute control to which the viewer involuntarily surrenders. Look for a while at Mr. Etty's pictures, and away you rush, your "eyes on fire," drunken with the luscious colours.... You fly from this ... and plunge into a green, shady landscape of Lee or Cres- wick ... or you set the world-nay, the Thames and the ocean- on fire with that incendiary Turner. ("PR," p. 712; emphasis added) The implied analogy between the effect of great art and drunk- enness not only suggests lack of control over one's response but, especially when coupled with the metaphor of gout, points to the danger in this obsession. Just as drunkenness causes one to forget one's responsibilities, continued exposure to High Art or the sirens makes one forget one's moral duties. Thackeray's protagonists suf- fer such ill-effects from prolonged sensual infatuation with the sirens, and Thackeray describes their predicament with the same drunkenness/fever images. George Osborne loses all social restraint and plans to commit adultery. Pendennis babbles in childish excess over Emily Costigan, and when he restrains himself from seeing Fanny Bolton, sublimates his desire in other forms of sensual grat- ification that recall Titmarsh's response to Poussin. He worked then too much; he walked and rode too much; he ate, drank, and smoked too much: nor could all the cigars and the punch of which he partook drive little Fanny's image out of his inflamed brain; and at the end of a week of this discipline and self-denial our young gentleman was in bed with a fever. (P, p. 495) Henry Esmond admits to being equally unhealthily obsessed with Beatrix: "what nights of rage, what days of torment, of passionate unfulfilled desire, of sickeningjealousy" (HE, p. 227). He eventually</page><page sequence="12">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 403 ends up like Rawdon Crawley, exiled from society, suffering from "some bankruptcy of his heart, which his spirit never recovered" (V, p. 22). Although Thackeray's sirens threaten because they can make a man forget his "duty," they are even more dangerous to them- selves because they are self-created works of art, artist and product. The siren must sell herself to live just as artists must sell their works. Like the artists she is tempted to-and usually does-alter herself to bring a higher price. Thackeray's expressive theory of art-that true art is a sincere, therefore natural, expression of one's nature- places a heavy burden on the artist. Art by this definition is nec- essarily self-revelatory-at least good art is. Artists' powers to en- gage their audience originate in their own emotional sincerity, genuinely felt by them when they create and, in turn, genuinely experienced by the audience.'8 This view accounts for Thackeray's rejection of the "purely mechanical skill" of the Annual painters and the "theatrical-heroic" artists. An artistic formula requires no emotion, only manual dexterity. Any kind of role-playing by rote that deceives for a base motive, whether its purpose is to win profit or a husband, drains the art work of its moral value, produces a less beautiful art work, and degrades the artist. Sincerity was so important to Thackeray that his basic text for a good painting was whether it touched the heart: "the best paintings address themselves to the best feelings of [the heart]. . . . Skill and handling are great parts of a painter's trade, but heart is the first" ("PR," p. 725). Anthony Trollope applied this sentiment to authors when he ad- vised them to "tell [their] tale as to touch [their] reader's heart. "19 Unavoidably, artists are forced to put part of themselves on canvas or paper. "8Such disparate critics as John Ruskin and William Michael Rossetti agreed with Thackeray about the importance of "sincerity" (John D. Rosenberg, The Darkening Glass: A Portrait of Ruskin's Genius [New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1961], p. 39). See also Ruskin, The Art of England (Sunnyside, Orpington, Kent: George Allen, 1883), esp. Lecture I; and George P Landow, The Aesthetic and Critical Theories ofJohn Ruskin (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1971), pp. 70- 90. Rossetti condemns many of the artists Thackeray praised, claiming that they did not have a "personal call" (Fine Art, Chiefly Contemporary [London: Macmillan, 1867], p. 8). "9An Autobiography, introd. Bradford Allen Booth (Berkeley: Univ. of Cali- fornia Press, 1947), p. 191.</page><page sequence="13">404 NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION Artistic success, then, had its price. Thackeray's aesthetic de- mand for sincerity worked against his desire to protect his privacy. And the more ambitious the work, the more the artist must demand of himself. Of Michelangelo and his LastJudgment, Thackeray won- dered, "How did the artist live amongst them, and create them? How did he suffer the painful labour of invention?" ("FSP," p. 682). The writer, too, "has to bring his tears and laughter, his recollec- tions, his personal griefs and joys, his private thoughts and feelings to market" (HE, pp. 595-96). Writing was actually more self-re- vealing than painting because it was not a onetime production. As Thackeray wrote in his 1850 preface to Pendennis, the serial pub- lication system "forced [the writer] into frankness of expression, and to speak out his own mind and feelings as they urge him.... It is a sort of confidential talk between writer and reader.... In the course of his volubility, the perpetual speaker must of necessity lay bare his own weaknesses, vanities, peculiarities" (PE p. ix). The siren's artistry is totally self-revealing because she creates and ex- hibits herself. If she is genuinely Sublime she can, like Beatrix, be consumed by her own brilliance and ambition. When she disguises her "real" self, as does Becky, she nevertheless reveals her falsity- immediately to the reader through the narrator's commentary and gradually to the other characters by her inability to sustain her role. The siren's dilemma is echoed in one of Thackeray's narrative tricks: assuming a narrative persona who then lays bare the secrets of artistic creation and is able to feign an "artistic" sincerity which protects his own feelings. The fallacy in this protective technique is that in order to have his persona received as "sincere" Thackeray must use his own feelings as the basis of the artifice. The paradox of the artists' and sirens' positions develops when they collide with public taste. Thackeray's rhapsodies about artistic power center on its ability to engage the viewer. To him, artists, whom he called "the public's servant[s]" ("OAE," p. 58), never cre- ate for themselves but for an audience. It is appropriate that the fictional counterpart of the artist is the siren who is as much actress as beauty, for what is an actress without an audience? For the siren, painter, and writer, the public world was a marketplace where they sold small pieces of themselves. Thackeray put it clearly in Ains- worth's Magazine in 1842: "Art is a matter of private enterprise here, like everything else: and our painters must suit the small rooms of</page><page sequence="14">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 405 their customers, and supply them with such objects as are likely to please them."20 Thackeray as teacher recommended David Wilkie's Scottish peasants, Daniel Maclise's Shakespearean scenes, and Wil- liam Mulready's pugilistic boys in preference to the gloriously cha- otic Turner or experimental Constable. A novice should be exposed to Copley Fielding's fields, not William Etty's nudes. But Thack- eray's private admiration of High Art crept out when he compared Etty to Rubens ("PR," p. 730; "SLFA," p. 745) or recognized Turn- er's sublimity.2' Nonetheless, Turnerian sunsets and Etty's nudes could not, like Charles Eastlake's The Salutation of the Aged Friar, be "such placid, pious companions for a man's study, that the continual presence of them could not fail to purify his taste and his heart" ("PR," p. 726). The aesthetic paradox of admiring yet repudiating High Art finds expression in Thackeray's novels in the opposition between the siren, both attractive and repulsive, and the purifying domestic woman, destined to be the protagonist's "companion." This artistic analogy can be extended when we examine the corrupting influence of the marketplace. The lure of gold and social position can trap the artist in his own condescension to the public as well as the siren in her role. For example, John Everett Millais, the onetime rebel, admitted to William Holman Hunt: "For my part, I paint what there is a demand for. There is a fashion going now for little girls in mob caps. Well, I satisfy it while it continues; but immediately it shows signs of flagging, I am ready to take to some other fashion of the last century."22 From Millais painting for money to Sir Edwin Landseer trapped by the public's demand for his paintings of kittens and faithful dogs was a short step. Landseer's anthropomorphic animals, accompanied by appropriate homilies, became so popular that the public expected almost nothing else. He himself said, "If people only knew as much about painting as I do .. . they would never buy my pictures."23 Even the respected Keeper of the National Gallery, Charles Eastlake, ran the danger 20"An Exhibition Gossip," Ainsworth's Magazine, 1 (1842), 319. 21"Turner," Sketches After English Landscape Painters, illus.

Even Thackeray had to admit he was glad to see the suppres- sion of the Art Unions in 1844 (although they were reintroduced and legalized in 1846) because the painters "are poets no longer, but money-hunters" who produce "fiddle-faddle" by painting "down to the level of the public intelligence" ("MG," pp. 702, 701). Iron- ically, then, public success could actually destroy the creative power that led to that success-a pattern which enmerges strongly in Thack- eray's sirens. The painter's Scylla and Charybdis also threatened the writer: Thackeray recognized the dilemma because he shared it. The artists supply [the public] with poor stuff-pretty cheap taw- dry toys and gimcracks in place of august and beautiful objects of art. It is always the case. I do not mean to say that the literary men are a bit better. Poor fellows of the pen and pencil! we must live. The public likes light literature and we write it. Here am I writing magazine jokes and follies, and why? Because the public like such, will purchase no other. ("MG," p. 702) But while Thackeray's art criticism warns against painting down to the marketplace, it is also full of exhortations to walk "the lowly path," "know what you can do" ("PG," p. 718), and, above all, know yourself for an ordinary person, not a great genius. His public stance praising "mediocre" artists such as W P. Frith, Charles East- lake, and Edwin Landseer is constantly undercut by his private admiration for Michelangelo, Titian, Rubens, Turner, and Etty. Nowhere is Thackeray's aesthetic paradox more evident than in its fictional metamorphosis as a perceptual system. The protag- onists may fall under the spell of their Ideal art objects, but the narrator continually exposes their distorted vision. Their recog- nition of the narrator's vision is the essential core of their matu- ration process in Pendennis, The Newcomes, and Henry Esmond. But in The Virginians and Philip the protagonists are significantly altered by a narrator who refuses to admit the attraction of the Ideal- and that narrator is Pendennis, once the most self-deluded of Thackeray's protagonists. Pen, "a sworn fire-worshipper and a Cor- 24David Robertson, Sir Charles Eastlake and the Victorian Art World (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1978), p. 36.</page><page sequence="16">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 407 sair" (E, p. 24), satisfies his yearnings for a "Zuleika" with Emily Costigan, whom he (through the narrator) likens to the Louvre Venus: "Her forehead was vast, and her black hair waved over it with a natural ripple.... Her ears were like two little pearl shells." The narrator presents a rather different picture. Emily never laughs because her teeth are not good; the sandals peeping out from her long, flowing robes "were of rather a large size" (PE p. 36); and her "vast" forehead covers an equally vast mental cavern, for Emily is stupid. Her classical appearance covers a placid, vulgar desire for hot toddies and a wealthy marriage (P, pp. 56, 61). Pen, like Pyg- malion, creates "the divinity which he loved" (P, p. 52). His self- deceiving passion for Emily fires his self-deceiving ambition to be a great artist, making him an enviable Byronic figure at college and inspiring his novel Walter Lorraine, his literary debut. When Pen's idealism sours and he becomes an absurdly worldly critic, blase at twenty, he creates a picture-book romance with Blanche Amory, whom the narrator ironically describes as a perfect portrait of a Beauty in an Annual Keepsake book, which Thackeray de- scribes elsewhere as "trumpery. "25 Blanche was fair and like a sylph. She had fair hair with green reflections in it. But she had dark eyebrows. She had long black eyelashes, which veiled beautiful brown eyes. She had such a slim waist, that it was a wonder to behold; and such slim little feet, that you would have thought the grass would hardly bend under them. Her lips were of the colour of faint rosebuds, and her voice war- bled limpidly over a set of the sweetest little pearly teeth ever seen.. . . She was always smiling, and a smile not only showed her teeth wonderfully, but likewise exhibited two lovely little pink dim- ples, that nestled in either cheek. (PE pp. 214-15) As with Thackeray's "portrait" of Becky, one must catch Thack- eray's irony in his saccharine diction: "such a slim waist," "warbled limpidly," "sweetest little pearly teeth," and so forth. However, while Blanche's inanimate counterpart in the Annuals superficially pre- sents the same "great eyes, and slim waist," she is really "a slovenly, ricketty, wooden imitation of [a human figure] tricked out in some tawdry feathers and frippery" ("WA," p. 761). Blanche, too, is a 25"A Word on the Annuals," Fraser's Magazine, 16 (1837), 757; hereafter cited in the text as "WA."</page><page sequence="17">408 NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION total fabrication; her real name is Betsy, she is a shrew, her father is a criminal, and she is unfaithful to Pen. Reminiscent of Becky Sharp, Blanche was educated in France, the home of artistic artifice according to nineteenth-century England. Clive Newcome and Henry Esmond are less guilty than Pen of actual delusion because Ethel and Beatrix are closer to the works of art that they are likened to, classical statuary and Renaissance portraits. Beatrix, a "brown beauty," exudes the sensuality of a Titian: Her eyes, hair, and eyebrows and eyelashes were dark: her hair curling with rich undulations, and waving over her shoulders; but her complexion was as dazzling white as snow in sunshine: except her cheeks, which were a bright red, and her lips, which were of a still deeper crimson. Her mouth and chin, they said, were too large and full, and so they might be for a goddess in marble, but not for a woman whose eyes were fire, whose look was love, whose voice was the sweetest low song, whose shape was perfect sym- metry. (HE, p. 198) But what the living "goddess" Beatrix resembles is "Artemis with the ringing bow and shafts flashing death upon the children of Niobe" (HE, p. 12 1). Not only is she more threatening than Blanche in Pendennis but her colors match her more vibrant personality. In The Newcomes the same color intensification fits Ethel, a "Veronese," with black hair, "almost blue," black eyebrows, a long neck, and "a savage smile on her face," like Salome. Clive also compares her to Judith, after murdering Holofernes (N, p. 251). The sirens' savagery is partly a necessity because they must compete to survive. They must live off the wealth and emotional energy of their victims just as an artist must live off his public. But women are not inanimate objects; by meddling with their "truth," creating roles to play, they debase themselves. In 1837 Thackeray himself put a name to the degeneration of the Annual artists, fore- shadowing the plight of his sirens: "the poor painter . .. to live. . . must not follow the bent of his own genius, but cater, as best he may, for the public inclination; and the consequence has been, that his art is little better than a kind of prostitution" ("WA," p. 758). Thackeray's more intelligent and genuine sirens know that they contradict the professed standards of their society. Beatrix and</page><page sequence="18">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 409 especially Ethel know that they are deceitful in a society which purports to judge women by their simplicity and purity. The bitter narrators of The Virginians and Philip who castigate Lady Maria and Agnes are prefigured by the tirades of Beatrix and Ethel accusing the marketplace of creating them-as it did. Beatrix scathingly classes herself as a piece of ornamental art: "My face is my fortune. Who'll come?-buy, buy, buy! I cannot toil, neither can I spin, but I can play twenty-three games on the cards. I can dance the last dance, I can hunt the stag, and I think I could shoot flying" (HE, p. 310). Beatrix openly directs her charms toward powerful men, the Duke of Hamilton and the Pretender, because she covets their masculine ability to act. She feels that "nature has condemned" her to a passive role, and her strongest desire is to have been a man (HE, p. 310), but failing that, she will live vicariously, exchanging her beauty for their energy. Though Beatrix sells herself freely, Ethel is forced reluctantly onto the auction block: "We are sold ... we are as much sold as Turkish women; the only difference being that our masters may have but one Circassian at a time. No, there is no freedom for us. I wear my green ticket, and wait till my master comes. But every day as I think of our slavery, I revolt against it more." (N, p. 338) The correspondence between these women and art works is strengthened when we remember that Ethel's speech occurs after she and Lady Kew have been to a picture exhibition, and the green ticket she flaunts in front of her family is a parody of the green ticket hung on paintings that have been sold. The sirens' and the artists' self-exposure-either to create gen- uine art or to sustain false art-becomes potentially self-destructive when the artists must imitate their own lost sincerity. The conse- quent disintegration is particularly poignant in the case of an ex- pressive artist such as Beatrix (or Thackeray), who eventually loses her inspiration and is forced to become mimetic and, ironically, imitate herself. We see Beatrix, Lady Maria, and Agnes, worn out and corrupted by their own games. The same weariness and hy- pocrisy threaten the writer, according to Thackeray in "Sterne and Goldsmith":</page><page sequence="19">410 NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION Does he exaggerate his grief, so as to get his reader's pity for a false sensibility? feign indignation, so as to establish a character for virtue? elaborate repartees, so that he may pass for a wit? ... How much of the paint and emphasis is necessary for the fair business of the stage, and how much of the rant and rouge is put on for the vanity of the actor? His audience trusts him: can he trust himself? How much was deliberate calculation and impos- ture-how much was false sensibility-and how much true feel- ing? Where did the lie begin, and did he know where? and where did the truth end in the art and scheme of this man of genius, this actor, this quack? ("The English Humourists," in HE, p. 596) Becky, Blanche, Lady Maria, and Agnes Twysden fall into the artist's trap; they are corrupted by their roles until they can no longer tell the masquerade from the truth. Becky's emphatic (and sincere) denials of her guilt when Rawdon discovers her with Lord Steyne ignore the fact that, whatever her technical innocence, she is morally culpable. Pendennis, his eyes finally opened to Blanche's machinations, sees that she is trapped in her own illusions, much as he once was. "I must have emotions-il m'en donne. Il m'ecrit. Il ecrit tres-bien, voyez-vous-comme un pirate-comme un Bohemien-comme un homme...." Pen had never seen her or known so much about her in all the years of their intimacy as he saw and knew now: though he saw more than existed in reality. For this young lady was not able to carry out any emotion to the full; but had a sham enthusiasm, a sham hatred, a sham love, a sham taste, a sham grief. (P, p. 724) Blanche's emotions are "a little sham sentiment . .. illustrat[ing] a little sham art" ("WA," p. 758). Beatrix is the most tragic example of the corrupted artist be- cause she willfully corrupts her own brilliance. The slow physical disintegration, the outward manifestation of her moral decline, begins in Henry Esmond when Esmond discovers her intrigue with the Pretender. Her immorality "desecrate[s]" her cheek, "tar- nishe[s]" her beauty metaphorically, and then, as in Dorian Gray's portrait, literally ages her face: "The roses had shuddered out of her cheeks; her eyes were glaring; she looked quite old" (HE, 412,</page><page sequence="20">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 411 416). That is the last time we see her until The Virginians when Thackeray shows us a grotesque old crone, still manipulating any- one close to her. It is no surprise that moral depravity has its physical counter- part if we remember Thackeray's insistence on the need for emo- tional sincerity to produce good art. Like Ruskin and most of the art critics of his time, Thackeray equated beauty and morality. A beautiful work of art either preached a moral lesson or inspired beneficent emotional associations. Theoretically, as the artist lost belief in the product or produced the work of art for the wrong motive, the works would look increasingly artificial and eventually become simply ugly. This process is tested consciously and uncon- sciously in The Virginians and Philip. What might be called a creative dissolution characterizes both these novels in content and form. The usual pattern-aspiring young artists, somehow valiant even in their inadequacy, enticed by what they think is an ideal beauty, finally perceiving their own mediocrity and settling down with wives and children-is ridiculed by the narrators and further debased by the characterization of the protagonists and the sirens. On a subtler level, the formal fabric of the novels disintegrates because Thackeray parodies his own familiar imagery and questions tra- ditional novel conventions. Thackeray's distrust of his medium26 stemmed from his unwillingness to reconcile, however unsatisfac- torily, the conflict between private ambitions and public duty. As if to signify his own artistic exhaustion, Thackeray almost boasts about his remarkably ordinary protagonists in The Virginians and Philip. Pen, Clive, and Henry all have talent, looks, and artistic sensitivity; they suffer from their experiences and are finally ma- ture enough to consciously make the "right" choices, Laura, Ethel, and Rachel. Harry and Philip may go through the motions, but 26Thackeray called The Virginians "clever but stupid" and implied that his novel-writing faculties were pretty well used up (Letters, IV, 80, 115). When presented with the contract for Philip, he moaned, "I may want to give up novel-writing but how refuse when I am paid such prodigious sums? Why didnt they buy me at 30, not the tired old horse at 50?" (Letters, IV, 136; emphasis added). Whitwell Elwin recorded Thackeray's actual distaste for his subject in Philip: "I have told my tale in the novel department. I can repeat old things in a pleasant way, but I have nothing fresh to say. I get sick of my task when I am ill, and think, Good heavens! what is all this stuff about?" (Letters, IV, 242, n. 44).</page><page sequence="21">412 NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION they are frankly not intelligent enough to learn from their expe- riences. Both are specimens of English "character": large-boned, good-humored, moral, and totally nonintellectual. Harry Warring- ton is almost embarrassingly naive; he believes everyone's lies until his naivete crosses the border into stupidity. Everything conspires to expose poor Harry, from falling in love with an antiquated co- quette to admitting he has never heard of Richardson or Fielding. Ironically, the most devastating blow is dealt by his loving brother George, the narrator of the second half of The Virginians. George arrives in England just in time to save Harry from debtor's prison- and in a twinkling sees through those people who have been duping Harry for months. Philip fares only slightly better. Pendennis, the narrator, takes pains to assure the reader of Philip's good nature, though he is equally insistent about disclosing his social clumsiness and faux pas. The proverbial bull in a china shop, Philip is too insensitive to see his social errors. He is grossly myopic about Agnes Twysden. Pen- dennis never lets the reader see Agnes as anything but a pitiful schemer. Philip, like Harry, is duped beyond the reader's patience. Even when he is courting Charlotte, Philip makes an awkward Romeo. While his fight with Ringwood Twysden may be emotionally justified, disturbing a public ball is the action of a lout, not a gentleman. The more intellectual narrators of The Virginians and Philip, Pendennis and George Warrington, ridicule their clownish protag- onists and, by doing so, ridicule the story Thackeray has been telling all his life. Gordon N. Ray notes the extreme bitterness of Thack- eray's last novels and states that his narratorial "masks operated rather as an encouragement, since they enabled him to disown direct responsibility for what he says."27 The narrative mask which allowed Thackeray as Michael Angelo Titmarsh and the Manager of the Performance to be sincere while reserving his privacy now becomes a vehicle for venting his bitterness at his own artistic cre- ations. This unrelenting narrative satire encourages the dissolution of the fictional world because the reader cannot forget the narrator long enough to become involved in the protagonist and his world; the novels remain elaborate games subject to change according to the narrators' whims. 27Thackeray: The Age of Wisdom, 1847-1863, p. 373.</page><page sequence="22">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 413 Pendennis, filling in the gaps left by the "Warrington Ms.," as he explains in the first chapter of The Virginians, seems to take pains to make his readers dislike his characters, at least until George comes on the scene. Not only is Harry too obtuse for sympathy and Lady Maria a rouge-covered witch, but George and Harry's mother, Rachel, the namesake of the long-suffering angel of Henry Esmond, is an unjust, petty tyrant. "So that little mistress of the Virginian Castlewood ... had the knack of rendering the people round about her uncomfortable; quarrelled with those she loved best, and exercised over them her wayward jealousies and impe- rious humours, until they were not sorry to leave her" (V, p. 111). Much of Pen's relentlessness comes to light when he submerges himself, letting the characters condemn themselves. Maria's con- frontation with Beatrix, now Madame Bernstein, exposes their seaminess as no siren metaphor could. Maria, almost old enough to be Harry's mother, has compromised herself with letters to him, and he has lost the incriminating letters. An ugly scene ensues as Madame tries to buy Harry's freedom. Haggling over his price, they taunt each other with family scandal after family scandal (V, pp. 298-300). The scene is sharper than those in the early vitu- perative days of Vanity Fair without any of the relieving humor or philosophical distance. Even mild-mannered George, who narrates the last quarter of The Virginians, is overtly hostile toward his family. He surprisingly chooses the selfish Madame Bernstein for his audience when he mimics Lady Warrington's (his aunt) shrieking harangue about his marriage. Pacific George also threatens to "break" Beau Lothair's "ugly face" if he continues to flirt with Theo, George's wife (V, p. 677). He is particularly harsh, although accurate, when he de- scribes the Castlewood family waiting to hear Madame Bernstein's will as "hungry for the prey" (V, p. 713). George, in fact, ends up severing all relations with the Castlewoods (V, p. 809). The "Editor" makes a point of emphasizing George's bitterness about his early life in a footnote to the "Warrington Ms." which stresses the con- tradiction between George's professions of tolerance and his actual inability to forgive his relations (V, p. 698). When Pendennis assumes sole responsibility for the text in Philip, the melancholic, bitter perception of the world and its in- habitants includes the readers. Pendennis describes the writer as Thackeray describes the siren: as a cannibal. By reading the novel,</page><page sequence="23">414 NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION the readers also become cannibals because they "devour" Philip and his problems for their own aesthetic gratification. Or, as Pen puts it, "Wife, children, guests, servants, charwoman, we are all actually making a meal off Philip Firmin's bones as it were" (AP, p. 537). Characteristic of this uncompromising picture of the writer- text-reader relationship is the total absence of narratorial sympathy for the sirens, Lady Maria and Agnes Twysden. When the artistic Ideal is proven to be false or unattainable, what then happens to the public face of the artist? One obvious result is that the art work will lose its originality, become a mechanical reproduction. Both Lady Maria and Agnes rely on cosmetics and theatrical mannerisms for their conquests. And both have been on the auction block many times. Pendennis as editor and narrator refuses to let the reader see Lady Maria and Agnes Twysden through Harry's and Philip's rose- colored glasses; instead he dwells on their age, promiscuity, heart- lessness, and the stupidity of anyone who could still be fooled by their tricks. In a contorted metaphor, Harry exemplifies the gullible victim, longing after Lady Maria like a dog slavering for a bone that he only thinks he sees reflected in the "treacherous pools" of Lady Maria's eyes. In other words, while Harry imagines beauty, innocence, and true love, Maria uses him, devours him, and, as Thackeray says, "coolly suck[s] up the meat" (V, p. 148). Thackeray (Pen) goes on to expose not just the hideous underside of the siren but the pathetic waste of loving her: Ah! what a heap of wreck lies beneath some of those quiet surfaces! What treasures we have dropped into them! What chased golden dishes, what precious jewels of love, what bones after bones, and sweetest heart's flesh! Do not some very faithful and unlucky dogs jump in bodily, when they are swallowed up heads and tails entirely? (V, p. 148) This could be the voice of the artist, at odds with himself now that he can no longer believe in his work. The work itself, "the mis- chievous siren slut" (V, p. 148), still demands devotion, but devotion that the artist can no longer give. The artist has changed while the work of art has not, and creation now is a matter of producing an expected product by rote. A green-eyed Naiad never rests until she has inveigled a fellow under the water; she sings after him, she dances after him; she</page><page sequence="24">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 415 winds round him, glittering tortuously; she warbles and whispers dainty secrets at his cheek, she kisses his feet, she leers at him from out of her rushes: all her beds sigh out, "Come, sweet youth! Hither, hither, rosy Hylas!" Pop goes Hylas.... Has his captivator any pleasure? . .. No more than a fisherman landing at Brighton does of one out of a hundred thousand herrings. (V, 148-49) It is not simply that the siren has aged but that she has aged because the artist looks at her with old eyes that can no longer be enchanted: The last time Ulysses rowed by the Sirens' bank, he and his men did not care though a whole shoal of them were singing and combing their longest locks. Young Telemachus was for jumping overboard: but the tough old crew held the silly bawling lad. They were deaf, and could not hear his bawling nor the sea-nymphs' singing. They were dim of sight, and did not see how lovely the witches were. (V, p. 149) Oddly enough the shortsighted old Ulysses can see the sirens more clearly for what they are. Like Pendennis, this Ulysses has, after all, gone through the fire once. To the narrator, the witches are "stale, old, leering" and depend upon artificial devices to seduce: "I daresay you have painted your cheeks by this time; your wretched old songs are as out of fashion as Mozart, and it is all false hair you are combing." Lady Maria "paints the lashes from under which she ogles him; will put by into a box when she has done the ringlets into which she would inveigle him; and if she eats him . . . will crunch his bones with a new set of grinders just from the dentist's, and warranted for mastication" (V, p. 149). Her wiles are reduced to a sordid job of fishing for men and are used merely to survive- it is the only thing she knows how to do. Appropriately, Thackeray marries Maria off to a blustering, pretentious heroic actor, Hagan, who eventually becomes an equally pretentious preacher. The sirens' corruption becomes explicit in Philip where an acerbic Pendennis classes Agnes with a prostitute. Well, I am not mortally angry with poor Traviata tramping the pavement, with the gas-lamp flaring on her poor painted smile, else my indignant virtue and squeamish modesty would never walk Piccadilly or get the air. But Lais, quite moral and very neatly, primly, and straitly laced;-Phyrne, not the least dishevelled, but with a fixature for her hair, and the best stays, fastened by mamma;-your High Church or Evangelical Aspasia, the model of all proprieties, and owner of all virgin-purity blooms, ready to</page><page sequence="25">416 NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION sell her cheek to the oldest old fogey who has money and a title;- these are the Unfortunates. (AP, p. 189) This increased hostility toward the sirens jars the reader because it is untempered by the usual moments of good humor and tol- erance that make Becky, Emily, Beatrix, and Ethel so appealing at times. Even more harmful to Thackeray's conventional fictional world is the narrator's consistent parodying of Thackeray's custom- ary description of his sirens as works of art. Just as the protagonists can no longer be taken seriously because the narrators demean them, the sirens are no longer genuine sexual or beautiful objects- to anyone of "normal" sight. The classical burlesque of the sirens and Ulysses in The Virginians is even more ridiculous in Philip when the virgin goddess Diana assumes contemporary garb. Agnes, an older version of Becky or Blanche, does not perform at noblemen's houses or country estates, but is a tavern room: "That dear girl is like a beautiful fragrant bower-room at the Star and Garter at Richmond, with honeysuckles mayhap trailing round the windows, from which you behold one of the most lovely and pleasant of wood and river scenes" (AP, pp. 267-68). So far, excepting the jarring introduction of the Star and Garter and the suspicious diction ("dear girl," "most lovely and pleasant"), Thackeray follows his standard description of woman as art work, in this case a landscape. But a tavern has different requirements than a garden: "The tables are decorated with flowers, rich wine-cups sparkle on the board, and Captain Jones's party have everything they can desire. Their dinner over, and that company gone, the same waiters, the same flowers, the same cups and crystals, array themselves for Mr. Brown and his party." Notice that by Philip the siren not only "eats" her victims but is "eaten," used up, by her public. Even when Agnes is com- pared to classical art, the image is twisted: "Or, if you won't have Agnes Twysden compared to the Star and Garter Tavern, which must admit mixed company, liken her to the chaste moon, who shines on shepherds of all complexions, swarthy or fair" (AP, p. 268). This generous Diana mocks the earlier picture of Beatrix as "haughty and beautiful," like "the famous antique statue of the huntress Diana-at one time haughty, rapid, imperious, with eyes and arrows that dart and kill" (HE, p. 121). Thackeray's standard metaphors ridicule instead of praise in The Virginians and Philip and suggest the "used-up" feeling he himself had by now.</page><page sequence="26">THACKERAY'S AESTHETIC IDEAL 417 The narrators' bitterness and the degeneration of the siren metaphor suggest the Choice of Hercules pattern became increas- ingly inadequate for Thackeray. Throughout Pendennis, The New- comes, and Henry Esmond, there is an insistence that something noble exists in the protagonists' youthful devotion to an aesthetic and sexual ideal. While Pen, Clive, and Henry must grow through their infatuations with High Art and the sirens, these are necessary ex- periences, initiations into a broader, deeper world. As Thackeray pointed out in his 1850 preface to Pendennis, Pen's encounter with Emily and Fanny awakened his passions, made of him a feeling man (E, p. x). And consciously rejecting Fanny and his own un- realistic ambitions allowed Pen to manifest control over his own destiny. The price the protagonists pay for their experiences is the acquisition of a permanent sense of loss, but the gain, besides the aesthetic awakening, is mastery of the self. Important to this process is the genuineness of both the sirens' and the protagonists' talents. There is true beauty in Ethel, Emily, Fanny, and Beatrix which warrants admiration, just as Pen, Clive, and Henry all have at least some talent, partlyjustifying their aspirations. To adapt a metaphor from George Levine comparing the uncontrolled sublimity of the mountain to the domestic beauty of the valley, Thackeray's pro- tagonists experience the breathless exhilaration of the heights be- fore they descend to the valley to become journalist, portrait-painter, historian, and paterfamilias.28 Harry and Philip start and stay in the valley. They lack artistic imagination-the best Harry can do is live like a rake while Philip never rises above hack journalism-but neither do they evince any aspiration toward the Ideal. Moreover, as if to underscore their mundanity, their infatuation with the sexual sublime is with com- pletely artificial sirens whom the narrators will not allow to be even good imitations of sublimity. Becky and Blanche are at least (in the beginning) young, attractive, accomplished, and technically inno- cent. Lady Maria and Agnes Twysden are verging on their "closing nights" when Harry and Philip become enamored. Comparing these versions suggests that the success of the pro- tagonists' experience with the Sublime depended on Thackeray's ability to re-create his own belief in and response to an Ideal aes- thetic/sensual object and that the importance of the experience was 28See "High and Low," p. 142.</page><page sequence="27">418 NINETEENTH-CENTURY FICTION in the liberation of the imagination, however temporary. When Thackeray lost his ability or willingness to remember the heights, both the work of art and the aesthetic experience failed. Thackeray himself said prophetically, in 1840, when explaining why men lose their capacity to be moved by art, "It is not the artist who fails, but the men who grow cold-the men from whom the illusions (why illusions? realities) of youth disappear one by one; who have no leisure to be happy."29 The necessities of the marketplace which destroyed the belief in the Ideal took its toll on the sirens in the novels, indicating Thackeray's own progressive dissatisfaction. Becky crashes from the heights to a degenerate Bohemian existence, slowly inching her way back to an inglorious life as a "wronged woman." Emily sells herself for a title. Maria and Beatrix, we have seen, become harpies, and Maria as Hagan's wife is an object of comic ridicule, having abandoned her class. Agnes sells herself to a man who beats her and indirectly kills her child. She finally leaves him to live "a life into which we will look no further" in that center of decadence, Rome (AP, p. 633). The only siren who escapes moral destruction is Ethel, who abandons her role to become an ersatz mother to her brother's children. Ethel takes lessons in domesticity from Thack- eray's epitome of the domestic ideal, Laura Pendennis. As Thackeray said, it was not the artist who failed, but the person. Artistically, in terms of style, The Virginians and Philip are as successful as any of the earlier novels; in fact, their easy con- versational tone obscures the fatal weakness caused by the failure of the Choice of Hercules pattern, a failure caused by Thackeray's own loss of belief. Thackeray balked in his preface to Pendennis (1850) at having to adapt his artistic vision to the necessities of social convention because "truth" was his guide: "I ask you to believe that this person writing strives to tell the truth. If there is not that, there is nothing" (P. p. ix). Eleven years later, this Ideal has been found unattainable; the marketplace has demanded conformity, not vi- sion. Pendennis mocks his own spiritlessness in Philip. Now, I am ready to say that Nero was a monarch with many elegant accomplishments, and considerable natural amiability of disposi- tion. I praise and admire success wherever I meet it....

But I don't offend: I trust I don't offend. (AP, p. 146; emphasis added) This is a bitter parody of Thackeray's youthful espousal of art acceptable to everyone, mediocre art. In light of his previous in- sistence on truth, it also admits creative failure in an aesthetic de- pending upon sincerity as the test of artistic worth. Pendennis' stringent satire of Agnes, Philip, Laura, and himself belies the innocuousness he claims for himself. This contradiction is the child of the larger paradox created by Thackeray's aesthetic demand to experience the Sublime, pursue the Ideal, but remain content "on the lowly path." That the paradox remains unresolved meant the eventual failure of the pattern which had depended upon a com- promise to give meaning in the earlier novels.30 The consequent bitter and empty finger exercises characterizing The Virginians and Philip prove that for Thackeray there was "nothing" if not "truth"- and truth as emotional sincerity failed when aesthetic desire could no longer be reconciled with the world of Mammon. University of Texas, San Antonio 30From The Newcomes to The Adventures of Philip the conclusions demonstrate an increasing reluctance to accept the conventional marriage and the retreat to the country that is so characteristic of the closure of nineteenth-century novels. In general, all Thackeray's novels fight against this compromise, but in the last three, while the siren is still a primary obstacle, the final union either does not occur or brings insufficient joy. Clive and Ethel are not married in the world of The Newcomes but in Fable-land, the equivalent of the Vanity Fair puppet show. But without the illusion of Fable-land, the vision is even bleaker in The Virginians. Harry's marriage is not happy; instead of being rewarded for escaping Lady Maria, he remains ignorant and dwindles into a henpecked husband on his Virginia estate. His only relief comes with Fanny's death and Hetty's rejection of his proposal. Bachelorhood is Harry's reward. Not even this partial fulfillment remains in Philip. Domestic felicity, which has been sat- irized by Pen throughout the book, is certainly not assured in the Pantomime, which is a parody of the more dignified Fable-land. The "Abode of Bliss" and "Hall of Prismatic Splendor" have fewer pretenses to reality than the fox and the grapes of The Newcomes, which at least teaches a genuine moral lesson. The deus ex machina at the end burlesques the fairy-tale conclusion. The "Good Fairy in the Revolving Temple of Blinding Bliss" is Woolcomb (AP, p. 620), Agnes' brutal mulatto husband. Instead of delicately waving a magic wand, Woolcomb's unintentional benevolence results from careening around a market square to collide with a statue. In the ridiculous wreck, a will is revealed in a secret compartment. Money creates the debased Fable-land where Philip and Charlotte will live.</page></plain_text>
