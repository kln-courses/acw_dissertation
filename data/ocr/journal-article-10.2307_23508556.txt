<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pseudepigraphic Invention and Diachronic Stratification in the Stammaitic Component of the Bavli: the Case of Sukka 28 Jay Rovner Jewish Theological Seminary Close analysis of Talmud Bavti Sukka 2 8a-b shows that Abbaye and Rava, two Amoraic interlocutors, could not have voiced the teachings attributed to them in the course of discussion. Not only are the attributions fictitious, so are the teachings themselves. Further, the raw materials out of which Abbaye's and Rava's pronouncements were manufactured by the Stammaitic pseudepigraphers who constructed the sugya can be located in the overall context of Sukka there. Upon further examination, the sugya proves to be separable into two layers; both are Stammaitic and late,but one layer is later than the other. The original layer is eas ily recovered by comparison with a parallel in b.Qiddusin 34a-b. The second layer transforms the first sugya into a dialectical essay far more complex in design and grandiose in vision. It is noteworthy that the two literary layers are distinguishable not only chrono logically, but ideologically as well. Each seems to have been mobilized to serve pro grams dedicated to very different goals, probably on the part of two different groups. Each group raised distinct types of problems, for which they were willing to accept solutions far different in nature. It is interesting that, confronted by a Mishnaic exemption from religious activities extending to the two classes: women and slaves, the BabylonianTal mud will invariably show interest in the exemption of women, but not slaves (cf., e.g.,Berakhot 20a-b, Suk. 28a-b). Even more interesting is the fact that,of all of the facets that the Bavli could have explored, it chose — in both loci — not to explore or even specify the reason for the exemption, but rather to explicate the authority underlying it. This interest in hermeneutics and ex egesis is indeed characteristic of the Bavli. Therefore, the phenomenon holds great interest for understanding the motivations, methods, and meaning of this foundational cultural document. Intensive analysis of a Babylonian Talmudic sugya such as Suk. 28a-b raises several text-critical issues which can only be resolved by a construction of the 11</page><page sequence="2">12 JAY ROVNER [2] nature and formation of the"proto-Talmud"towards the end of the Amoraic period,by recovering the problems that this"proto-Talmud"presented to its post-Amoraic(Stammaitic) redactors, and, through teasing out the methods that they developed, to resolve those concerns. The results of the Stammaitic program are manifest in the (redacted) Talmud that they bequeathed to us. The aforementioned "proto-Talmud" consisted of Amoraic and Tannaitic oral-textual traditions amalgamated and collated when, towards the end of the Amoraic period, they were arranged and structured in relation to the Mishnah. Tradition newly ordered furnished ensuing generations a breadth of synoptic vision never before imagined because it had not been attainable until so much material had been collected and juxtaposed. However, the results were as troubling as they were empowering. Stammaim were confronted by multiple overlapping traditions. Rather than select some and suppress others, the Stammaim piously chose to rationalize them all di alectically by discovering and revealing (i.e.,constructing) a hermeneutically necessary niche for each teaching. Suk. 28a-b,which can be separated into two textual layers of Stammaitic provenance, discloses two diachronically dis tinguishable approaches. The first layer shows how material from the "proto Talmud "could be adapted and transformed into innovative pseudepigraphic inventions whose authority and cogency were sustained by attribution to fa mous recent Amoraim. The second textual layer is a product of a group more distanced from the actual Talmudic process. This group sets up arbitrary dif ficulties that can trigger the imposition of preciously abstract solutions which may be realized in awesomely grandiose creations: as a result, the multiple, overlapping, received traditions can be radically realigned. Comparison of another another sugya, Bavli Qiddusin 34-35, withSw£.28's double-layered artifact, re veals there as well a bifurcated pair of Stammaitic creations similarly distin guishable diachronically. Although it is possible to locate these projects within the transmission his tory of Amoraic and Tannaitic teachings and their redacted settings in the academies of fifth or sixth century Sassanian Babylonia, extrapolations from those phenomena that could shed light on broader issues of social or polit ical history remain a matter of speculation. Attributions Attributions and the formulations represented. The Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud, hereafter: Bavli or Talmud, abbreviated : b.) contains thousands of at tributed statements,disputes,and debates. Although some scholars despair of verifying the accuracy of individual attributions,1 others have demonstrated ( 1 ) In" What's in a Name : the Problem of Rabbinic 'Biography' " (Approaches to AncientJudaism: Theory Theory and Practice [Missoula, MT, 1978] 77-96), W. S.Green has set out the problems with lo eating an attributed statement in its historical and literary contexts. L.Jacobs has found that,</page><page sequence="3">[3] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 13 the overall reliability of the Talmudic attributional system? It is certainly the case that matters of attribution often engage the authorities, tradents, and though it "would be a ridiculous notion" to think that the Bavli is pseudepigraphic,"some of it is, however, undoubtedly pseudepigraphic and far more than is commonly appreciated" ("How Much of the Babylonian Talmud is Pseudepigraphic?" Structure and Form in the Babylonian Tal mud mud [Cambridge-New York, NY, 1991] 17, and cf. the whole chapter there, pp. 6-17). According to S. Stern ("The Concept of Authorship in the Babylonian Talmud,"//.V 46 [1995] 183-95), Talmud evidences contradictory assumptions about authorship. Historically based attributional agnosticism is a major working assumption of Neusnerian criticism ; it played a key motivating role in the development of Neusner's view that Rabbinic works must be studied as discrete docu ments. See e.g., the summarizing treatment of the Bavli and its recent students in A.J. Avery Peck, "The Mishnah, Tosefta, and the Tal 111 vAs"Judaism of Late Antiquity, Part 1: the Literary and Archaeological Archaeological Sources, J. Neusner (ed.) (Leiden, 1995) 198 ff. The latter's characterization of the Mishnah applies to any other Rabbinic document as well, ". . . whatever the traditions and ideas its redactors inherited from previous generations, their work of redaction both in choosing what to preserve and in shaping the material to meet their own needs so obscured any past meaning as to make the Mishnah truly and completely an expression of their own world view alone" {ibid., 181). Neusner has addressed the issue many times; cf. especially, The Bavli's One Voice:Voice: Types andForms of Analytical Discourse and Their Fixed Order of Appearance (Atlanta,GA,1gg1 ). Neusner has summarized his position there,pp.453ff.and 209ff.,he has forcefully distinguished his approach from the source critical approach of D. Halivni. The corollary of the view that Rab binic documents share "the attributions of 'traditions' to rabbinic authorities [as] an obvious feature," (J. N. Lightstone, The Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, its Social Meaning and Context [Waterloo,Ontario, 1994] 126),is the idea that these documents may properly be studied only as reflections of the attitudes of those ultimately responsible for their redaction. As Lightstone noted, although the redactors may indeed have received earlier traditions, we have no way of verifying that formulae attributed to those early traditions are indeed early (p. 15) or that at tributed statements were not "invented" (p. 126; cf. 122 ff.). It should be noted that Neusner has indeed acknowledged that the Bavli contains "writings" deriving from elsewhere, e.g., a document no longer extant, perhaps collections of material in specific genres ( biographies, handbooks), or even compositions that seem to have been created independently of any documentary setting (cf., e.g., The Rules of Composition of the Talmud of Baby Ionia:Ionia: the Cogency of the Bavli's Composite [Atlanta, GA, 1991] 17 ff., especially 49 f.). It is possible that such an approach could open the door to more refined analysis and make possible the identification of the kinds of coherent segments within literary units. Neusner has, in the past and in the context of Tannaitic literature, distinguished between three types of traditions, bio graphical,graphical, exegetical and legal, and acknowledged that the latter traditions seem easier to verify, albeit in a general albeit in a general way (cf. "TheTalmud as History; the1g78Allan Bronfman Lecture . . ."[West mount,mount, Quebec, 1979] 15 ff ). An additional problem confronting the question of the historical truth of attributional claims, although this applies more to biography and aggadic material than to halakhic teachings, is the possibility that the attributed statement has been generated by generic requirements. See H. A. Fischel,Fischel,"Story and History : Greco-Roman Rhetoric and Pharisaism,"Essays in Greco-Roman and Talmudic Literature,SelectedTalmudic Literature,SelectedTalmudic Literature,Selected loith a Prolegomenon by Henry A.

Kraemer, "On the Reliability of Attributions in the Bavli]' HUCA 60(1989)175-90,</page><page sequence="4">14 JAY ROVNER [4] redactors of the Talmud.3 To be sure, those attributed statements are oral literary constructs. Such speech does not necessarily partake of the nature of historically exact quotation ; rather, it consists for the most part of formula tions crafted for purposes of memorization, recitation, and transmission, of ten with a specific conceptual context or a distinct cultural setting in mind. Moreover, many of these traditions have undergone transformation through glossing in the course of transmission and redaction? Their original signifi cance may also have been modified or even transmuted as a result of incor poration into the dialectical web of Talmudic arguments (sugyot, singular: sugya). The practice of modification through glossing implies great respect for their formulated traditions on the part of tradents and redactors. The tradi don is preserved as received, even as its meaning is updated, as it were, or ap plied in new contexts. A postmodern assumption that no statement may be construed independent of interpretation certainly holds true with respect to the traditions of the Talmudic authorities: their teachings have been sub jected to many layers of interpretation from before they were formulated and transmitted until long after. Because of this tradental textual conservatism, however, the student of Talmudic traditions may often recover multiple lay ers of meaning, both that of an original textualization as well as the trans formations it has undergone whether as a result of glosses and/or inclusion in new (oral-) literary contexts. Extrapolated formulations.Extrapolated formulations. However, even those willing to give credence to the Talmudic attributions are at times confronted by more complicated her meneutical situations. It is clear that traditions have at times been extrapo lated from an authority's teaching in one context and then reformulated, in his name, with reference to settings with which he had no connection.

Of course, the same processes of modulation undoubtedly underlie the "original" form of the state ment: "עלינו להתייחס אליו [אל המימרא] כמקור ספרותי מובהק, ולא כציטוט מילולי של דבור חפשי" (idem., 309).</page><page sequence="5">[5] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 15 least there a kernel of the original, nuclear, teaching (or its formulation) may often be inferred and reconstructed? Sometimes the extrapolated formula tion cites a more general principal that is supposed to underlie a specific formulation? PseudepigraphicPseudepigraphic formulations. But sometimes it must be acknowledged that the attribution is simply a fiction, its contents a pseudepigraphic creation on the part of its redactors.7 This, along with some extrapolation as well, is the (5) Sometimes it will be observed of an attributed statement that it is not an authentic quo tatation, but rather that it was extrapolated מכללא (mikhelala 'derived by inference') from an other situation in which the attributee was involved. See H. Albeck,"השתלשלות מאמרי האמוראים מבוא לתלמודים ",וקביעתם בתלמוד, op. cit.,452-522. Although it is basically impossible to recover the actual settings out of which traditions arose, there may be some heuristic value to considering the following possibilities in assessing the re liability of differing characterizations of a teaching or ruling. The master may have phrased his thought variously, and with different meanings, in different contexts. He (or his tradents) may not have thought of all possibilities when enunciating the teaching. The master may have changed his mind with the passage of time and increased experience. The tradents may simply have mis understood or misformulated the teaching. For an intriguing study of such phenomena in the case of Maimonides, a scholar who functioned, much like an Amora, as both a teacher and a judge, and the margins and revisions of whose compositions reveal changes in his thinkings, see M. A. Friedman's detailed analysis of lecture notes left by a student in the Cairo Genizah, "רשימות תלמיד בבית מדרשו של הרמב"ם באמונות ודעות ובהלכה,"Tarfc62(1993)523-83• (Cf.n.99 below for a case where several sugyot had been edited to reflect a changed halakhic position.) (6) The teaching may be introduced as לטעמיה (letaameh 'according to his reasoning'), fol lowed lowed by a citation of the "original" teaching. See J. L. Rubenstein,"רב פלוני לטעמיה דאמר" SidraSidraSidra 10(1994)111-29 (and cf. 111, n.i. there). (7) Putting the emphasis on the fictionalized contents, as opposed to the attributions, focuses on a different aspect of the problem treated by S.Stern {op. cit., n. 2 above). For him, the question is whether one can trust an attribution. Here we know that the attribution is fictitious, but feel that the significance lies in the fictionality : the creation of fictionalized exchanges is itself mean ingful.ingful. On the creation of fictionalized dialogue in the Bavli (and the Yerushalmi), cf. S. Y. Fried man, [תלמוד ערוך, פרק השוכר את האומנין... [הפירושים, op. cit., n. too below, pp. 383,387, and 387,387, n. 113. L.Jacobs {op.cit.,via), speculates that certain attributions are pseudepigraphic since the des ignated contents pun on the name of the authority (p. 15, and cf. ibid., n. 30). Of course, the op posite could have occurred as well, viz., the topic may have been labeled so as to pun mnemoni cally on the master's name. Pseudepigraphical or fictional sugyot were recognized by the Medieval glossators, Tosafot, and further treated by modern scholars. Cf. A.Weiss' summary discussion,לחקר התלמוד (New York,ny, 1954c),"פרק שני: סוגיא פיקטיבית"and"ספר שני: אוירה ספרותית וקביעת צורתו של החומר פרק ראשון: ברייתא ומימרא ,^^m"18-63-D.Kraemer, has suggested thatmuchoftheargumen tation between R.Yohanan and Resh Lakish in the Bavli is fictional (cf. his Stylistic Characteristics of Amoraic Literature of Amoraic Literature of Amoraic Literature [Ph.D. diss., Jewish Theological Seminary, 1984)) 182-213; cf. P.E.Hayman, Development and Development and Change in the Teachings of Rabbi Yohanan ben Nafha [Ph.D. diss.,Yeshiva University, 1g90]).The sources on transfers and borrowings,cited below n.47,are spotted with claims that much of the work is pseudepigraphic.

Rubenstein, op. cit. above, n. 6.</page><page sequence="6">16 JAY ROVNER [6] case with sugyat b.Suk. 28a-b, which traces and analyses the sources for the Mishnah's ruling that women are not required to take up residence together with their menfolk in the sukka (a booth or temporary dwelling constructed for the observance of the autumn festival of Sukkot) during Sukkot? Despite attributions to the famous pair Rava and Abbaye, as well as their teacher and sometime colleague, Rabbah, those sages could not have made the statements attributed to them.9 The claim of pseudepigraphic attribution is heuristic in away that a global suspicion of all attribution is not: systematic suspicion suggests a chaotic ap proach on the part of the tradents and redactors towards their sources, whereas an indication of pseudepigraphy invites inquiry into the reasons that certain Amoraim were targeted to the exclusion of others. Following this line of inquiry with regard to b.Suk. 28 will lead to a better understanding of the attitudes of Stammaitic redactors to their Amoraic predecessors. In addition, a window will open up on the form of the"Talmud" which was present to them. Moreover, because the style and methodology of b.Suk. 28 are similar to those of another anonymous composition on the exemption of women from pos itive time-bound commandments (which category embraces dwelling in the sukka sukka on Sukkot), tentative conclusions may be strengthened by comparison of common factors. Layered Layered sugyot. At the same time that they indulged in pseudepigraphic com position, exploiting that technique to transform the previous intentions of (8) Mishnah( hereafter: m.)Suk. 2:8. On the Second Temple background, and the question of whether this exemption is historical or but a literary reflex, cf. J. Rovner, "Rhetorical Strategy and Dialectical Necessity in the Babylonian : the Case of Kiddushin 343-453"/-/UCA 65 ( 1994)45 on p. 198 f. While the (post-destruction) Rabbis may have (ex post facto) exempted women because of the time-bound rule, it seems likely that reasons of sexual modesty probably played a signifi cant factor in Rabbinic considerations (cf. b.Suk. 2b~3a, where the tradition that Queen Heleni dwelt in usukka is explained in terms of a large sukka containing several rooms; on fol. 25a there, a groom is exempted from sukka for reasons of sexual modesty). The most complete recent treatment is that of Y.Tabory,מועדי ישראל בתקופת המשנה והתלמוד (Jerusalem, 1995) 156 ff-&gt;al though many questions are left unexplored because the author accepts his sources at face value. I.Burgansky, op. cit., n.55 below, concludes (albeit on the basis of the textual conflicts per vading our sugya rather than historical considerations) that the exemption originated as a tra ditional norm,and that Scriptural authorizations were but secondary asmakhtaot (cf. pp.410.no. bet,bet, and 403). (9) As a consequence, several accounts based upon this passage require revision. An exam pie from ritual studies is Tabory's understanding of the Amoraic explanation for the exemption of women from sukka as attributed to Rabbah, Abbaye, and Rava (op. cit., 171 f.). In the history of Jewish legal concepts, D. Halivni's suggestion (Peshat and Derash: Plain and Applied Meaning in Rabbinic ExegesislNewRabbinic ExegesislNewRabbinic ExegesislNew York, NY, 1991)15) that Rava's usage of the verbal form of s-m-kh (אסמכינהו asmekhinho)asmekhinho)asmekhinho) influenced RavAshi who first used the nominal form אסמכתא (asmakhta) is no longer tenable.</page><page sequence="7">[7] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 17 their sources, the composers of this sugya continued to exercise an essentially conservative tradental approach!0 This allows for the reconstruction of an original anonymous sugya which was subsequently updated to reflect a dif ferent orientation by a second set of redactors, anonymous as well!1 Again, the ( 10) Despite the questions raised against the credibility of Talmudic attributions and quo tations by, e.g.,J.Neusner and L.Jacobs, nonetheless, the Talmud's dedication to identifying quotations and preserving them as such must be taken seriously (as pointed out by S. Stern, n. 2 above). Acknowledging that the redacted formulation is unlikely to be identical with the his torical saying, that redacted text nonetheless has its own tradental life within the memorized tra dirions of the group preserving it. Tannaitic and Amoraic Talmudic quotations participate in both oral and written conventions. As oral teachings they indeed would be subject to modifica tion according to the judgment of the master and tradents. Nonetheless, whether the statements were composed in written form or orally, they are not necessarily extemporized anew accord ing to the conventions of oral-formulaic composition ; rather, they may well have been formu lated for preservation in a (fairly well) fixed wording and memorized for transmission. The memorization of texts for production and performance in oral settings was practiced in Greek rhetorical and philosophical schools (cf. D.E.Aune,"Oral Tradition in the Hellenistic world,"/« sus sus and the Oral Gospel Tradition [ Sheffield, England, 1991 =JSN T 64]5g-106[esp. 86-88]). This seems indeed to have been the case at Qumran (cf. S.Talmon,"Oral Tradition and Written Trans mission,or the Heard and the Seen Word in Judaism of the Second Temple Period,"/«sus and the Oral Oral Gospel Tradition, 121-58). As Elman summarized the situation with regard to the Talmud,"most evidence indicates that memorization [not improvisation] was the goal (Authority and Tradition: Toseftan baraitot in Talmu die die die Babylonia [Hoboken, nj, 1994] 84). s. Y. Friedman,"להתהוות שינויי הגירסאות בתלמוד הבבלי" SidraSidra 7 ( 1991 )67-102, has indicated that Tannaitic and Amoraic texts do tend to be stable (cf. 97, and the final paragraph of 98, n.68 there). However, the argumentational manipulation of those traditions, worked out in conceptually structured patterns, was somewhat fluid in its formula tion during the period of its oral transmission and continuing into its inscribed history (Fried man, idem., passim). (11) Our sugya is summed up well in the following observation : את דברי סתם התלמוד אץ לראות כפעולה חד פעמית. בכמה סוגיות ראינו שלבי פיתוח בלשון התלמוד הנראים ומסתברים כמעשי שני בעלי גמרא, כשהמאוחר מקשה על סוגייתו של המוקדם לו, וממשיך אותה (S.Y.Friedman, תלמוד ערוך: פרק השוכר את האומנון, בבלי בבא מציעא, פרק ששי...[הנוסח] [Jerusalem, 1996122,andcf.n.92 there, pp.12 f., 180,190 f.,297f. of Friedman's תלמוד ערוך: פרק השוכר את האומנין, בבלי בבא מציעא, פרק ששי ...[הפירושים][הפירושים] [Jerusalem, 199°])• Multi-layered anonymous sugyot or anonymous sugyot that have been reworked (sometimes in a second location) have been identified by, e.g., D.Hal ivni, מקורות ומסורות: ביאורים בתלמוד לסדר מועד (Jerusalem, 1975) 348 f• ("ted in Y.

Neusner has acknowledged that Talmudic com positions ("composites") may have been made of components, but he insists that the new prod uct represents the thought and language of the redactors (cf., e.g., his The Rules of Composition of of the Talmud of Babylonia: the Cogency of the Bavli's Composite [Atlanta, GA, 1gg1]). See also n.66 below, for an instance of Stammaitic reuse of Abbaye's midrash in our sugya in cArak. 3b. It should be noted that, while the phenomenon of multiple-layered sugyot is significant and interesting,</page><page sequence="8">18 JAY ROVNER [8] approaches and purposes of the two sugyot reveal much about the different ways in which late authors related to the received Talmud, what challenged them about their sources, and what they contributed, both to the Talmudic process and to its intellectual program. The textual problems that lead ineluctably to the conclusion that b.Suk. 28 is a pseudepigraphic composition, the layered nature of this text, and an ex position of the purposes of its creators will be analysed in this article. The presentation will be structured as follows. First, the sugya will be introduced, in the original and in translation, and its argument will be summarized (§ 1 ).12 Second, the pseudepigraphic nature of the sugya and its fabricated claims will be disclosed (§2).The pseudepigraphic nature of the discourse having been demonstrated, evidence of its complex textual history will be adduced through the identification of lexical and logical conflicts created by the dif fering editorial programs (§3).Its literary and intellectual history, and impli cations for general questions of the Talmudic process will be explored fur therther (§ 4). From the forthcoming analysis, it will be come clear that the work is late, that it is at the same time both a composite production and a unified whole in which a secondary Stammaitic structure stretches an original Stam maitic production well beyond the limits conceived by the first level redac tors!3B.Suk. 28 is a literary creation14 that exhibits such careful craftsmanship the various literary layers may not necessarily resolve themselves into an identical series of compositional manifestations (cf. n.119 below). (12) References to loci in this article are designated as sections(§),and organized solely by numbers, e.g.,"§3.1." In contrast, loci in the sugya are cited by units and are keyed to segments organized according to letters, subarranged by numbers, etc., e.g.,"B.2.a." (13) Although I.Burgansky and N.Aminoah,the two contemporary scholars who have pub lished analyses of this sugya, failed to uncover its pseudepigraphic nature, they have concluded that it is a two tier production. Burgansky's reason revolves around a hypothetical change in us age : the early understanding of hilkheta as a traditional norm was eclipsed when a later redactor took took it as a halakhah le-mosheh mi-sinai (cf. op. cit., 403 f., n.55 below). For Aminoah,achronolog ical inconsistency resulting when Rava asked a question (B.i.b) which Abbaye,followed by Rava himself, solved (B.2.b.2), requires a two tiered hypothesis: the first Rava is from a primary sugya onto which the second Rava was transferred and grafted (cf. Aminoah, op. cit., 188, nn.54, and 5 there; p. 187, n. 2; it should be noted that an early commentator ["פירוש קדום"cited n.63 below] whose text read רבא in both lines, has made the two appearances of Rava seem un problematic by construing B.2.b as a dispute between Rava and Abbaye). According to the so lution proposed in this article, the diachronic sequence of the tiers is the reverse. In addition, because they did not consider that the source of the pseudepigraphic construction (B.2.b) laid out below, §2 (especially §2.3-2.4), the aforementioned scholars concluded that the sugya origi nated, not in Sukka, but elsewhere. (14) The use of "literary" is not meant to rule out "oral." It would be too time-consuming to consider the implications of the foregoing analysis on the question of whether sugyot were com</page><page sequence="9">[9] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 1g that it must be taken as a serious, purposeful, creation ; as such, it more than justifies an inquiry into the issues raised above. posed posed orally or in writing (which is a question totally separate from that of whether they were transmitted transmitted orally or in writing, cf. n, to above). Similarly, we could only explore in the most gen eral way the nature of the "Talmud" presupposed by either compositional layer of this sugya (cf. n. 45 below). Finally, a larger sample of sugyot exhaustively and comprehensively analysed along the lines developed here would be required in order to substantiate significant conclusions. The following possible connections ought to be explored in further research. The prece dents for oral transmission, both within and outside of Jewish or Rabbinic composition, support the notion of texts memorized and faithfully transmitted (n. 10). On the other hand, the relative fluidity of later textual layers (anonymous argumentation, cf. n.8g with n.45),is also consistent with oral transmission of "fixed" texts. Maintaining distinctive approaches and expectations with regard to material handled by conflicting redactional and tradental protocols, we could compare oral-literary, even cheirographic, rhetorical precedents that would, e.g., illuminate the practice of incorporating canonical quotations as fixed text into the more free-form, dialectical discourse, and ground it culturally (Jaffee, cited n. 45 below, has suggested connections with clas sical rhetorical paradigms analogous to the memorization of text as well as to the phenomenon of rhetorically derived reformulations, which might apply in the case of the newer dialogue). Most importantly, the widespread use of transfers and borrowings of fixed texts, extending even to the borrowing of stock phrases and formulations drawn from those texts, which has of ten been discussed in Jewish philological scholarship on anonymous composition (n. 47) could be illuminated from the perspective of orality. "Borrowing" implies a bibliographical locus or context. It might be helpful to conceive of the quoted passages or phrases as traditional mater ial that has been incorporated into the "register"called upon by Talmudic adepts in their cul tural "arena" (cf., e.g., J. M. Foley, The Singer of Tales in Performance [Bloomington-Indianapolis, I IN, 1995] ). It could be seen as characteristic of the multiform intertextuality encountered in the oral rhetorical paideia described by Jaffee (n. 45). There, disciples were trained, first to memo rize classical sources, then to modify those texts according to various paradigms ; they were drilled intensively in a system of continuous and ongoing recycling (specifically ,Jaffee wrote of the ways in which chriae could be borrowed and subsequently re-used in new textual transformations. My impression is that rabbinical education would produce pupils thoroughly trained in dialectical argumentation, although not to the extent that their Christian or pagan contemporaries were : this is because they did not share the Christian and pagan connection with Greek, including both the Greek language and classical curricula designed heavily around rhetoric (cf. R.S.Chapin, MesopotamianMesopotamian Scholasticism : a Comparison of theJewish and Christian"Schools' [D.H.L.diss.,HUC-JIR, Cincinnati,OH, 1990] 16-32). However, the fact that one can distinguish textual layers in the Talmud diachronically accord ing to unique rhetorical usages and topical concerns (nn.58 and tig) implies that this oral cul ture should not be conceived of as "traditional" in the sense of endlessly "calling up" the same sugya, but always differently, recreating it repeatedly in new permutations in a scholastic culture that remained stable over centuries. My findings indicate a (fairly well) fixed anonymous text (the first anonymous layer) modified by second stage anonymous writers (cf. §3) working, ac cording to a specific methodology developed to manipulate and control the unique textual ac complishment (the recent formation of the proto-Talmud, n. 45) in a specific period between the Amoraim and the Sevoraim (according to Halivni's determination, in the fifth or sixth centuries, n.119).</page><page sequence="10">20 JAY ROVNER [10] 1.

B.2.a.2 And, moreover, what is the necessity for a Scriptural verse or for a traditional law?

As to the Day of Atonement [also] can it not be derived from [the statement] Rabjudah made in the name of Rab, for Rabjudah citing Rab stated and so the school of R.

B.2.b.1 "Abbaye answered, Indeed Sukka is a traditional law, and still it is necessary. For I would have said, since 'Ye shall dwell' implies, in the same manner as you ordinarily live; as one's permanent abode is for husband and wife, so the Sukka must be for husband and wife, therefore he informs us that it is not so." B.2.b.2 "Raba said, It is necessary, since I might have said, Deduce the fif teenth from the fifteenth of the Festival of Unleavened Bread: just as in the latter case women are bound by the obligation so in the former also women are bound, hence we were informed [that it is not so]." B.j.a.i And now that you say that Sukka is a traditional law, why is the Scrip tural verse necessary? B.3.a.2 To include converts. I would have said "the homeborn in Israel,"said the Divine Law, but not converts, therefore it informs us that it is not so. B.3-b.1 [That women must fast on] the Day of Atonement is deduced, is it not, from [the statement of] Rab Judah in the name of Rab? B.3.b.2 [The verse] is necessary [to include] the additional affliction. As I might have said that, since the Divine Law excluded the additional affliction from punishment and warning, women are entirely ex empt therefrom, therefore he informs us that they are subject to the obligation (I.W. Slotki [tr.], "Sukkah" The Babylonian Talmud, I. Ep stein [ed.] [London: Soncino Press, 1938] 124-26; note: the struc tural outline has been provided by J. Rovner). 1.1. 1.1. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT The argument of the above sugya maybe summarized as follows.The Mishnah teaches that women are exempt from dwelling in the sukka on the festival of Sukkot. Inquiring after the source of this ruling, the Talmud identifies an</page><page sequence="13">[13] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 23 exegetical baraita which traces the exemption to a Scriptural passage, Leviticus 23:42 (11^' = כל האזרח בישראל ישבו בסכות of t/iehomeborn in Israel shall shall dwell in sukkot [booths]" ).The term"homeborn"(newJ PS: "citizens")36 is understood to comprise both men and women, while the definite article of האזרח ("the citizens") is read as intending that this rule be limited to a subset of those "citizens," viz., the community of men, to the exclusion of women (A)?7 A collocutor counters with an exegetical teaching based upon Lev 16:29, where the definite article of האזרח teaches the opposite, viz., the inclusion of women (in ענוי, Yom Kippur affliction)?8 The need to include females by means of exegesis implies that "homeborn" denotes only males. This second speaker insists that אזרח (without the definite article) must everywhere be in tended in a limited sense, not abroad one (B.i.a). Apparently granting the as sumption that אזרח bears the same meaning regardless of context, Rabbah (36) Perhaps, for כל האזרח ("each of the homeborn"), read (with The Torah תורה, the Five Books 0/M0s«s[Philadelphia,PA,1g62] 227):"all citizens," to represent האזרח as an instance of "the em ployment of general names as collectives in the singular, to denote the sum total of individuals belonging to the class" (Gesenius'Hebrew Grammar, as edited and enlarged by F.Kautzsch, A.E.Gow\ey [ed.] [Oxford, 1910 corrected] 406. It was a pattern characteristic of Leviticus "to legislate for a reli gious community or network of communities" ( The J PS Torah Commentary, Leviticus ויקרא, Com mentary by B.Levine[Philadelphia,PA, 1g89]109,referred from comment to Lev 23: 42). I have placed the emphases on the definite article throughout to anticipate the exegesis of the sugya. (37) In contrast to the interest of Scripture (Leviticus) in clarifying the inclusion or exclusion of various communities, and its use of the article with the singular (האזרח) to denote all mem bers of a class (cf. the preceding note), the Sifra questions whether the definite article comes to include or to exclude (cf. Rhetorical Necessity, op. cit., n. 8 above, the final paragraph in n. 45 on p. 199). The closest midrashic parallel, also an interpretation of Lev 23:42, is in Sifra Emor, Perek 17:9 17:9(Weiss[éd.]fol. 103a): -"אזרח"-זה אזרח, "האזרח"-(לרבות)[להוציא] את הנשים-, „כל האזרח" לרבות את הקטנים-, "בישראל"-לרבות גרים ועבדים משוחררים. The same idea occurs in the Sifrei Bemidbar, Shelah, Piska 112 (Horovitz,[ed.] 119): לפי שהוא אומר "כל האזרח בישראל ישבו בסוכות'' שומע אני אף הנשים במשמע, ת"ל ,,בבני ישראל," זה בנה אב-בכל מקום שנא' "אזרח" בזכרים הכתוב מדבר. There, however, the exclusion is derived from the phrase: אזרח [limited by] בבני ישראל (Num 15:29), and generalized to all occurrences of אזרח (the presence of the definite article [האזרח] is irrelevant). Comparison with our sugya (A.i.b as explicated in B.i.a) shows that all under stand אזרח to mean any citizen, whether a man or a woman. Sifra, like our sugya,excludes women because אזרח, which means any citizen, whether male or female) was augmented by the definite article (האזרח), which serves here to limit and exclude. On the other hand, both the Bavli pas sage including women in Yom Kippur affliction (B.i.a) and the corresponding exegesis in the Sifra Sifra (cited n. 41 below) understand אזרח to denote only men, and add women only because the definite article can come to include them. Sifrei Bemidbar seems to understand that אזרח im plies both genders, but that the Torah uses it to signify men, because it has been so defined in Num 15:29. (38) The inclusion of women in Yom Kippur affliction is taken up in classical rabbinical lit erature only here in the Bavli and in the Sifra, Ahare mot, Perek 17:9 (fol. 103a) and ibid., Emor, Perek 14:4 f. (fol. 83a).</page><page sequence="14">24 JAY ROVNER [14] acknowledges that one of the above rulings is not really grounded in Scrip ture, rather, it is a hilkheta (halakhah le-mosheh mi-sinai)?' its received exegesis being merely an asmakhta (B.i.b). The Talmud responds, setting a double problem. First, it inquires as to which of the two Tannaitic teachings is based upon Scripture and which is based upon a tradition. Second, it finds the whole preceding approach prob lematic because the contradictory rulings on women's participation in each festival may be derived from one of two general scripturally-based principles (Sukka from the overall feminine exemption from positive time-bound commandments, and Yom Kippur from the specified inclusion of women in penalties that have been mandated by Scripture). Therefore, neither of the exegetical baraitot (wherein the contradictory treatments of אזרח/האזרח ori ginated) is really necessary at all. On this second argument, the problem is far more serious than had been thought (B. 2.a). The Talmud divides the ensuing analysis into two units. First it deals with the claim that one of the two rules is a halakhah le-mosheh mi-sinai, and sub sûmes under that analysis both aspects of the problem set in B.2.a, namely, which is a halakhah le-mosheh mi-sinai ( B. 2.a. 1 ), and why such a special revela tion was necessary(B.2.a.2).Abbaye and Rava both defend Rabbah's claim. These two Amoraim agree that it is the exemption of women from sukka that is grounded, not in the (problematic) exclusionary exegesis of האזרח in (39) Rashi explains hilkheta here as a halakhah le-mosheh mi-sinai. However, regarding the ap plication of agricultural legislation outside of Palestine, the Hebrew term הלכה (as in mFOr. 3:9: הערלה הלכה) has been understood by Babylonian Amoraim to denote: הלכות מדינה, i.e.,custom ary local practice/law (cf. b. Qidd. 38b~3ga), although Rabbi Yohanan there explained the phrase as הלכה למשה מסיני. Cf. Ch. Albeck, ששה סדרי משנה, סדר זרעים (Jerusalem, 1957) 3°3 and 413. on the Orlah passage. A consideration significant to our argument is that the meaning of hilkheta in b.Qidd. ga, which we will argue is the original locus of the hilkheta claim attributed to Rava, could well be dif ferent. Referring there to a question about differences in the formulation of various contracts, the matter could well turn on practices enshrined in customary law. However, in the other two loci, here in b.Suk. 28 and in b.Nid. 32, a conflict involving exegetical baraitot is at stake, so that the claim of asmakhta is pushed back to a Sinaitic revelation in order to clarify the intent of Scripture (Burgansky, op. cit., 406, n. 55 below reaches opposite conclusions in regard to both passages). See the important studies of S.SafraiC^nSxvi מחקרי תלמוד ';הלכה למשה מסיני-היסטוריה או 1[1ggo] 11-38, and 1 [1990] 11-38, and in בימי הבית ובימי המשנה: מחקרים בתולדות ישראל [Jerusalem, 1994] 54875־&gt; published in shorter form under the same title in the Proceedings of the Eleventh World Congress of Jewish Jewish Studies [Jerusalem, 1985] 23-30) and M.Jaffee ("Halakhah in Early Rabbinic Judaism : In novation Beyond Exegesis,Tradition Before the Oral Torah"Innovation in Religious Traditions; Essays Essays in the Interpretation of Religious Change, M.Williams, C.

Each Amora supplies a different argument to prove the need for a hilkheta. In this way, the Talmud provides a three-fold tradition on women and the sukka: although; 1. in principle, women are exempt from all positive time-bound commandments, amongst which sukka is numbered; 2. Abbaye and Rava each produce a potential exe gesis of a Scriptural passage which could lead one to conclude that sukka is an exception to the overall feminine exemption and that women are evidently not exempt; therefore ; 3. by way of resolving the conflict as to whether women are obligated or exempt, the halakhah le-mosheh mi-sinai was revealed to make clear that the exemption principle is indeed operative ( B.2.b).4" Having solved the problem(s) generated by Rabbah's claim that one of the two festival rules is a halakhah le-mosheh mi-sinai, the Talmud turns to the ques tion of Scripture. Both festivals' Scriptural sources have been rendered irrel evant, Sukkot by the hilkheta, and Yom Kippur by the universal inclusion of women in penalties. Hence the two segments of B.3 share the common goal of rationalizing the problematic pair of Scriptural interpretations in the mid rashic baraitot (A.i.b and B. 1. a respectively). Scripture in both baraitot is found to furnish independent halakhic content related to their original intent, though no longer identical with it. In addition, the interpretation of these verses frees both baraitot of any remaining difficulties.Therefore, the final two questions and answers form a separate unit, centered on Scripture as opposed to a halakhah le-mosheh mi-sinai. Basically, the purpose of this unit is to tie up loose ends. For sukka, the Talmud would like to know what halakhic purpose is served by Lev 23:42 after Rabbah has informed us that the exclusion of women there is merely an asmakhta. On the assumption that the definite article האזרח comes to include (per the argument of B.i.a), the conclusion is, that converts are in eluded in the obligation to dwell in sukkot (B.3.a).41 (4&lt;נ) The pronouncement of the original baraita (A.i.b) becomes a fourth source, as an asmakhta.asmakhta. (41) A parallel to the Bavli's midrash is found in the Sifra, Emor, Perek 17:9 (fol. 103a), al though the two achieve the desired conclusion using different approaches. The absence of a ci tation formula in the Bavli leaves the provenance of its midrash moot. (On Stammaitic use of Tan naitic material without indication or attribution, cf. S. Friedman, cited n. 47 below). On b.Suk. 27b, the Bavli uses this verse as follows: ור' אליעזר האי כל האזרח מאי עביר ליה? לגר שנתגייר במתים וקטן שנתגדל בינתיםבינתים. The Yerushalmi(hereafter:y.)Krf&gt;.12:1(fol.12b)interprets Lev 23:42 with respect to גרים as follows: "האזרח"-פרט לגרים, "בישראל"-פרט לגרי/ מיעוט אחר מיעוט - לרבות את הגרים. The inclusion of converts would strike the rabbinic reader as a Scriptural desideratum: since Scripture has specified the convert's (גר) inclusion along with, e.g., האזרח בישראל (Lev 16:29,18:29; Num t5:13_14 anfi 29-30)• Elsewhere, the fact that גרים were not mentioned in regard to Sukka could be experienced as a"gap" which challenged exegetes to find their prior inclusion implied. The appropriateness of this midrash is further illuminated by</page><page sequence="16">26 JAY ROVNER [16] Regarding Yom Kippur affliction, the Talmud has not yet explained the need for the inclusionary exegesis of Lev 16:29 in the face of the general rule including women in all prohibitions for which Scripture has provided a pen alty (in B.2.a, above; in the case of Yom Kippur affliction, the penalty is karat 'extirpation')?2 The reply is that the inclusion of האזרח covers tosefet'inui, the additional affliction required just before the onset of Yom Kippur. Although tosefettosefet 'inui is a Scriptural requirement?3 it is like a time-bound positive com mandment :44 accordingly, absent the specification of a penalty, women would be exempt! Therefore, without the inclusionary formulation of האזרח in Lev 16:29,women could not have been involved in the prohibition (B-3.b).With the solution of this question,all of the problems posed in this sugya(B. 2.a) have been resolved. 2. Identity of the Amoraim On the face of it, this seems like a standard Talmudic sugya. The reader's impression is that the Talmud seems to have come to the formers of this sugya comparison with other Sifra passages treating גרים and אזרחים Sifra Ahare Mot, Perek 7:g (fol. 83a,onLev16:2g): ,"אזרח"-זה אזרח, "האזרח''-לרבות נשי אזרח, "גר"-זה הגר, "הגר"-לרבות נשי גרים "בתוככם"-לרבות נשים ועבדים (the same exegesis applies to thesame language in Lev18:2gon for bidden sexual practices and unions: cf. Sifra ibid,., Perek 13:18 [fol. 86c]). There, just as האזרח (with definite article) includes Israelite women, so are the wives of converts included with הגר. In our case, where Israelite women have been excluded from sukka, there would be no need to include the wives of converts; hence the definite article of האזרח could well be applied to male converts. (42) Cf. Lev23:2g-30. (43) Tosefet 'inui is derived exegetically from Lev 23:32. It should be noted that the applica tion of the principle of מוסיפין מן החול על הקודש (one augments the observance of a sanctified period, e.g., Sabbaths and Festivals, by adding to it, at the beginning and at the end, from the adjacent secular day) to other sacred days is derived from tosefet 'inui on Yom Kippur. On both tosefet tosefet 'inui and the general augmentation, see b.Yoma 81b (and parallel in Rosh Hashanah 10a [incorrectly foliated ga and so reprinted in some editions])and Sifra Emor, Perek 14:5-7. Tosefet 'inui'inui is explicitly labeled de-Oraita (a Scriptually enjoined practice) in b.Sabb. 148a and parallel, Bes.Bes. 30a. 1^3-81161תוספת שבת",3מ," Tarbiz 52 ( 1g83)30g-23&gt; observed, probably correctly, that the practice of augmentation is more ancient than its exegetical derivation (based upon Y.Gilat, cited there,p. 323); Ta-Shema also noted (p.30g) that the Mekhilta Bahodesh functions as an other locus for the augmentation rule (by combining Exod 20:7 and Deut 5:11 ; cf. §7 Horovitz [éd.] 22g]). Not all decisors have accepted the derivation of the "principle of augmentation" from Scrip ture, e.g., by separating the source for the augmentation of affliction, which applies only to Yom Kippur, from that for additional abstention from labor, which applies to Sabbaths and all festi vais (cf. Abraham di Boton, Lehem Mishnah ad Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot shevitat 'asm 1:6 1:6 ;J.Karo,BetYosefadTurOrahHayyim 238, beginning; cf. also Ta-Shema, idem., 310 ; n.4.) Our sugya's discussion (B.3.b) aside, the question of the inclusion of women in tosefet 'inui would not have been raised.

Proper chronology is (45) When conceiving of the formation of the Talmud, a widely accepted form — critical idea is the " two source theory" of Talmudic redaction. The first stage of redaction involved the collation of Amoraic traditions with appropriate Mishnaic sources. At a secondary stage, the Am oraic teachings were linked in the process of incorporation into discursive, dialectical, and argu mentational frameworks composed by anonymous editors (Savoraim or Stammaim). D.Good blatt, summarizes the various approaches in "The Babylonian Talmud," Aufstieg und NiedergangNiedergang der Romischender Romischender Romischen Welt II tg:2 (Berlin,1979, repr. in The Study of AncientJudaism, J.Neusner [éd.] [New York, NY, 1981]) 285 ff. on "source criticism" and 314 f. on "two source theories" (cf. also H. L. Strack and G.Stemberger, Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash [Minneapolis, MN, 1992] 219 f., written under the assumption that sugyot redacted at different times and places could be com bined by later redactors into the chapters and tractates as we know them). A recent monograph that develops many aspects of the two source theory is D. W. Halivni, Midrash, Mishnah, and Gem ara:ara: theJewish Predilection forJustified Law (Cambridge, MA, 1986). Halivni coined the term Stam maim to describe the anonymous redactors responsible for the argumentational framework of the sugyot, as distinguished from the post-Amoraic and pre-Geonic group who functioned less intrusively than the Stammaim as editors and annotators, called Savoraim by the medieval Geo nim. (Before Halivni, the dialectic was generally thought of largely as a product of the Amoraic period, antedating the Savoraim, see below)The charts provided by R.Kalmin,o^.c!f.,xvii f. be low (and cf. the "Introduction," 1 ff.) summarize the chronological differences in the possible approaches to the anonymous component of the Talmud. (It should be noted that Halivni has modified his linkage of the Stammaim with the creation of anonymous argumentation by call ing attention to other roles that they must have played in the formulation and transmission of Amoraic teachings, tasks which were probably undertaken during the Amoraic period itself; cf. מקורות ומסורות: ביאורים בתלמיד, מסכת בבא קמא [Jerusalem, 1993], 7-21,מבוא). Both of the bibliographic handbooks cited above also summarize the older notion of "con tinuous redaction," whereby the anonymous editorial composition took place throughout the Amoraic period. For a recent réévaluation of evidence that the Stammaitic component must be later than the Amoraic part of the Talmud, cf. R.Kalmin, The Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud: Amoraic Amoraic or Saboraic (Cincinnati, OH, 1989) and see his chronologies of Saboraim (Savoraim/ Stammaim) xvii f. and 1-11. J. Hauptman has proposed a "three source theory" where editorial efforts to link extra Mishnaic Tannaitic traditions, baraitot, to the appropriate Mishnah texts preceded the afore mentioned (Amoraic) first stage (see The Development of the Talmudic Sugya: the Relationship Between Tannaitic and Ammaic Sources Tannaitic and Ammaic Sources Tannaitic and Ammaic Sources [Lanham, MD,1g88] 1 f., 213 f.; 2, n.5 there provides references to earlier research that proposed the early linkage of baraitot with the Mishnah). The result is that the Bavli's anonymous redactors received a"proto-Talmud"consisting of both baraitot (linked with the Mishnah already in Tannaitic times; J.N.Epstein,in מבואות לספרות האמוראים [Jerusalem Tel-Aviv, 1g62]12, ascribes this to the early Amoraim) and mimrot. This theory may fit well with the assumption that late Stammaitic authors received, and worked with, previously redacted Talmudic material, and that is how "proto-Talmud" is being used in the present article. However, the meaning of "proto-Talmud" as a source of baraitot linked with appropriate Mishnah segments (drawn perhaps from A.Weiss'phrase "התלמוד הקדמון," e.g., in התהוות התלמוד בשלמותו [New York, NY, 1943] 1 ; or Epstein's "התלמוד הקדום והכללי,"cf. his 69 מבואות) may reflect a degree of chronological anachronism, and does merit further research and clarification. For the point (or points?) at which baraitot were compiled and redacted is not necessarily identical</page><page sequence="18">28 JAY ROVNER [18] preserved: a teacher, Rabbah, is followed by his students, Abbaye and Rava, two colleagues often joined in debate in the Bavli. Unfortunately, the idyllic Amoraic picture is doomed from the start. with the point at which they were linked for tradental purposes with Mishnah segments. This distinction was drawn explicitly by A.Weiss: on the one hand, he supposes that Tannaitic ma terial had been formulated at the beginning of the Amoraic period (cf. לחקר התלמוד [New York, NY, 1954] 62 ), but he eloquently describes the extended period during which both Amoraic and Tannaitic sources were cycled and recycled, in both oral and literary formulations, before re ceiving final form(s) and context(s) (idem.,59 f.).Perhaps,comparison with the Tosefta would be helpful, since the latter is an exemplary collection of baraitot redacted in relation to the Mish nah, but which may well not have occurred until the Amoraic period or later (Y.Elman ,Authority and and Tradition: Toseftan Baraitot in Talmudic Babylonia [ Hoboken, N|, 1994], discusses the various points of view in his "Introduction,"1-12, and "Review of Past Research,"13-46). Curiously, while the Bavli may have used or adapted some of those sources, it probably did not know the Tosefta. Thus, the existence of (early forms) of baraitot and baraita collections that are found in both the Tosefta and the Bavli (even if in later versions in the latter) has no bearing on the determination of the period of redaction of the Tosefta (cf. Elman,op.rif, 80-86,278 no. 1,279 no. 3, and 280). Weiss makes clear that not all Amoraim or tradents were necessarily aware of every baraita, which may account for some of the duplicate traditions discussed by Hauptman (cf. Y. Elman, ibid.,ibid., 136). Requiring further clarification are the different ways in which each of the various Amoraic master-disciple circles or academies organized and taught their sources, when the transition from the reception of the Mishnah as a primary Tannaitic handbook to its fixing as the fulcrum of all other sources and traditions came to be reflected in (Amoraic or Stam maitic?) curricula (not all Amoraic teachings revolve around the Mishnah),and at what (pre Stammaitic?) point diverse circles' traditions came to be more widely known, accepted, collated, and integrated redactionally. D. Rosenthal,155-2°4 (1990 )1 מחקרי תלמוד ",עריכות קדומות בבבלי"&gt; has reminded us that sug yot may well have formed around a variety of curricular settings in addition to those struc tured around Mishnah instruction. The Amoraic curriculum is not really known. Still, even the formulation of some sugyotformulation of some sugyot reflects other focus points :בצד התפיסה שהתלמוד נסדר מתחילתו בצמוד לסדר המשנה, עלינו לתת את הדעת יותר ויותר-ובעקבות כף לשאול ולכוון את חקירתנו-שהחיבור הגדול הזה מורכב, מפרטים ופרטי פרטים שלא נאמרו ולא נסדרו רק בצמוד לששת סדרי המשנה, אלא הוא מורכב מסוגיות הכוללות משא ומתן בנושאים שונים, שהועלו בין החכמים בבית המדרש ומחוצה לו, בין השאר גם (אבל לא רק) בפירושי משנוית. ובלשונו של רש"י [בבא מציעא פו:א, ד"ה: רב אשי ורבינא סוף הוראה]: ,סוף כל האמוראים, עד ימיהם לא היתה גמרא על הסדר, אלא כשהיתה שאלה נשאלת 1. בטעם המשנה בבית מדרש, או שאלה על 2. מעשה המאורע בדין ממון או איסור והיתר כל אחד ואחד אומר טעמו, [ורב אשי ורבינא סדרו שמועות אמוראין שלפניהם וקבעו על סדר המסכתות כל אחד ואחד אצל המשנה הראויה והשנויה לה וכר, ואותן שאמרו לפניהם הקושיות והתירוצים שעליהם לא קבעום בגמרא על סדר המסכתות ומשנה שסדר רבי, ובאו רב אשי ורבינא וקבעום' (ibid., 197, supplemented by p. 155). A final consideration is that the decidedly li terary and documentary focus of our descriptions of how, out of its sources and traditions, the Talmud developed, may be incomplete, or even mis leading. Because the Bavli, in its final form, is laid out in relation to the Mishnah,does not neces sarily mean that, as later layers of text are stripped away, the early ones stand revealed as they "orig inally" related to that Mishnah. If, instead of the literary point of view, Rabbinic texts are seen in terms of the social setting and cultural expectations of Rabbinic paideia, then the "proto Talmud"would likely center on the master-disciple relationship ; its actualized context would be the oral performative context of topical inquiry and dialectical exchange on which instruction</page><page sequence="19">[1g][19][19] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 2g 2.1.2.1. RABBAH IS NOT RABBAH Rabbah's claim : הלכתא נינהו, ואסמכינהו רבנן אקראי, is curious. From the plural pronominal references, the point seems to be that both Sukkot and Yom Kip pur are halakhot le-mosheh mi-sinai (נינהו), and that the Scriptural warrant for both is an asmakhta (אסמכינהו). However, the redactor knew full well that only one hilkheta was claimed?6 for the query elicited by Rabbah's assertion is stated and learning were focused. For a large part of the Amoraic period, knowledge of these texts would be acquired, not through literary (inter-textual) relationships (e.g., with the Mishnah), but in the course of memorization, reflection and deliberation in the diverse ways in which a student would go about acquiring and displaying "cultural competence." Cf. M.Jaffee's illumi nating study, "The Oral Matrix of the Talmud Yerushalmi : Comparative Perspectives on Rhe torical Paideia and Discipleship in Rabbinic Culture" (August 13,1996, draft; I thank Professor Jaffee for giving me an opportunity to read this article). Cf. also S. Fraade's sketch of the social and text-related aspects of learning and of how Rabbinic teachings came to be juxtaposed and centered on Deuteronomy but they could also be reconfigured and utilized independently (From Tradition Tradition to Commentary: Torah and its Interpretation in the Midrash Sifrei to Deuteronomy [Albany, NY, 1991]) 17-20. It is tempting to suppose a pre-literary period (before the proto-Talmud) in which Amoraic teachings circulated orally. Although the wording of the teaching would be fixed, the tradition would become part of the oral repertoire of the sage. Although the sages were concerned that the teaching carry along reminiscences of its original thematic setting or textual referent, thus creating a contextual oral matrix, this consideration was not always relevant to the situation in which the saying was being reused; moreover, the setting may have been forgotten as the tra dition circulated. With reference to the Yerushalmi (which captures a much earlier combination of Amoraic and Stammaitic types than the Bavli),Y. Sussman cited Yerushalmi passages demon strafing that teachings were often recycled into other contexts, constraining Amoraim to at tempt to recover the original one,וכן תופעות וביטויים אחרים המלמדים על כך שבבתי המדרש של" האמוראים נהגו לגלגל כל סוגיא בכל מקום רלבנטי עד שכל התורה כולה הפכה ל,כדור אחד,' כדור שהוא 1]1 מחקרי תלמוד) "מתפתח וצומח עם כל גלגול וכל העברה ממקום למקום ומענין לעניןggo] 91,end of n. 156; it would be a beneficial exercise to review the material in the Bavli on extrapolated for mulations [cf. nn. 5-7 above] and on transfers and borrowings [n. 47 below] with an eye to dis tinguishing between oral and written literary situations and editorial from social settings). Re cycling of sources is a manifest technique of the framers of our sugya (cf. 14 above); however, they also worked in a literary context (whether written or oral) for their work pre-supposes the existence of a proto-talmud, since they made use of a form of a redacted Talmud (§4.1.2 For nation nation ofSugyot below). (46) Tosafot ad. Inc., s.v., הלכתא נינהו emend the plural form to the singular; E.E.Urbach (cited, n. 2 2 above) has argued that the latter is correct. However, the grammatical disparity should be seen rather as a routine invocation of traditional phraseology typical of an oral perfor mative context and mentality, and which the auditor would tend to ignore as he or she concen trates upon the phrase's connotative signification, than as a copyist's blunder in a written set ting. J. M.Foley has described similar phenomena, where a (denotative) gap between a phrase and its context occurs, in Immanent Art : From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic ( Blooming ton, IN, 1991) 85. The classical Rabbinic explanation is אשגרה (slip of the tongue/pen based upon routine usage ; cf. Aminoah, op. cit., 188, n. 7). Cf. the following note.</page><page sequence="20">30 JAY ROVNER [20] in the singular: הי קרא, והי הלכתא. Each collocutor understood that the above claim had not been made by Rabbah regarding Sukka. Rather, a statement plucked from another context, Amoraic attributee included, had been trans ferred here because it provided a solution to the problem set at B.t.af7 Thus, it bears something like the following meaning : "in regard to the apparent con tradictory denotations of אזרח, Rabbah's observation, in another context, to the effect that problematic Scriptural proofs may be asmakhtot for laws actu ally grounded in hilkhata (the plural of hilkheta), is relevant to our situation'.'48 In fact, the same statement appears anonymously in three other sugyot49 and in Rava's name in another two?0 In only one of the latter, b.Qidd. ga, do the plural grammatical references seem appropriate?1 Therefore, it is most likely that the statement, with Rava as its authority, originated there. This hy pothesis is supported by the fact the many manuscripts and printed editions of our own sugya preserve the ( presumably original) reading : Rava?2 instead of Rabbah?3 Thus, the impression that Rabbah's students rescued his proposal (47) Operative throughout the Talmud and formative in the crafting of sugyot, transfers and borrowings play an essential role and are manifest as compositional strategies.'"|nTÎ^ העברות תופעה יסודית היא של סידור התלמוד, וביניהן אף קביעת מימרות שלא היו בתלמוד הקדום "(cited from S.

For instance, in the statement attributed to Rava in b.Qidd. ga, which is the source from which that attributed hilkhetahilkheta assertion was transferred to b.Suk. 28,and which is where the aforementioned claim had first been linked with Rava's name (cf. n. 51 below; and note that, of the three loci of this Rava attribution, viz., b.Suk. 28, b.Qidd. 9, and b.Nid. 32, Rava had participated in the discussion prior to this line only in b.Qidd.), the report: אמר רבא ("Rava 'said' ") would signify, כאלו — "as though Rava had meant/as though Rava had said,"as A.Weiss, לחקר התלמוד, op. cit., observed: גם הלשון אמר פלוני, לשון האומר כאלו שהחולק ...הקדום בעצמו אמר זאת (p. 21 ; cf. also n. 12 2 below).

The statement attributed to Rabbah/Rava was originally made in an entirely different con text, whence it was transferred here by the authors of the sugya who identi fied the contradictory construction of האזרח at B.i.a. This finding has negative implications for the authenticity of Abbaye's and Rava's positions (B.2.b). For, while both fictitious attributions (e.g., borrow ings) and authentic ones may coexist in the dialectical web of aTalmudic dis cussion, it does not seem likely in this situation, where the impression has been created that Abbaye and Rava both have provided null exegetical essays to justify Rabbah/Rava's contextually inauthentic position. Still, it might be thought that Abbaye and Rava do represent actual positions operative in other contexts.54 However, this is a vain hope ; their words are pseudepigraphic creations, manufactured, along with the attributions, by the redactor-authors, as will become clear from the following evaluation. 2.2. RAVA IS NOT RAVA A close reading demonstrates that Rava's solution (,[לעולם סוכה הלכתא ו]איצטריך: סלקא דעתך אמינא יליף ,חמשה עשר'/,חמשר עשר' מחג המצות-מה להלן נשים חייבות ,אף כאן נשים ,חיינות-קמשמע לן B.2.b.2) is inherently problematic?5 Rava claims that the obligation of women to sukka could be derived from a compari son (gezerahson (gezerah shavah) with their obligation to Passover-eve observances,a com parison suggested by the common formula: hamishah 'asar. But in ascribing this comparison to Rava, this sugya's creators tipped their hand. For the gez eraherah shavah from the fifteenth of Nissan (the Seder night) to the fifteenth of Tishri(the first night of Sukkot) teaches the obligation to dwell in theswMaon the first night only. While the obligation to sukka for but one night may have been an option inTannaitic times (R.Eliezer's opponents in the Mishnah),56 it is unlikely that the Babylonian Amoraim saw it that way. Rava certainly versing or appearing with one another"are"uncertain,"for "nearly all of these 200 exchanges are between Abaye and his teacher, Rabbah." The confusion seems to derive from the fact that Rava (רבא) and Rabbah (רבה) were not distinguished orthographically in early transcriptions of the Talmud the Talmud (cf. Kalmin, !'dm., 179, n. 19 and S.Y.Friedman,"כתיב השמות רבה ורבא בתלמוד הבבלי," Sinai Sinai 5 5119 9140-64 [ צ)• On other confusions of the name Rava, cf. J.J. Spiegel,"הלכה מאוחרים אמר רבא הלכתא'-פסקי," Y.D.Gilat,Ch.Levine,Z.M.Rabinowitz(eds.), עיונים בספרות חז"לבמקרא ובתולדות ישראל מוגשים לפרופ' עזרא ציון מלמע (RamatGan, !982)206-14. (54) B.cArak. 3b, the only other place, is discussed in n.66 below. (55) Because of their failure to examine it, previous scholars did not realize that such exege sis, on Rava's part, would be impossible. I. Burgansky, מסכת סוכה של תלמוד בבלי, מקורתיה ודרכי עריכתה עריכתה (Ph.D. diss., Bar-Han University, 1979) 398-411 ; N. Aminoah, עריכת מסכתות סוכה ומועד קטן בתלמוד הבבלי (Jerusalem, 1989) 187 f■; Urbach, (ההלכה, op.cit., 265 f., n.38, there).Thisis the principal crux of our sugya, the key to its inherently problematic formation. (56) M.Suk. 2:6. From the conclusion of the Mishnah, it seems that R. Eliezer has taken a</page><page sequence="22">32 JAY ROVNER [22] did not, for at the very beginning of this tractate, we find Rava teaching: ,בסוכות תשבו שבעת ימים'57-אמרה תורה כל שבעת הימים צא מדירת קבע ושב בדירת עראי ..., and this very teaching is cited as normative by the Stammaitic authors of the preeminent sugya on the feminine exemption, b.Qidd. 34a). Since for Rava one must dwell in the sukka for seven days, the fifteenth/ fifteen thgezerah shavahshavah is simply inadequate. There is an even more severe problem,viz.,the original purpose of the gez erah shavah, botherah shavah, botherah shavah, both in theBavli(fol.27a) and theYerushalmi(2:7 [fol.51a] )is ex plicitly restricted to the obligation to take one's meal in the sukka (by the rule of the Mishnah here and by the point of comparison with the Pesah verse and its exegesis).Therefore the attribution to Rava, in the overall context of dwell ing in the sukka, of the above gezerah shavah, must perforce be inauthentic, a specious editorial fabrication. If If Rava/Rabbah's proposal is an instance of textual" transfer," Rava's is ev idently a case of fabrication plain and simple, a concoction of anonymous redactors. But, the realization that Rabbah of B. l.b is really also Rava, and was surely known as such to the redactors, makes one wonder what they could possibly have been thinking when they saddled him with such an unlikely midrashic position in B.2.b.2. The solution is closely tied to Abbaye, to which we now turn. 2.3. ABBAYE, IS NOT ORIGINAL The fact that Rabbah ( i.e., Rava) is not original to this sugya renders Abbaye's contribution (לעולם סוכה הלכתא, ואיצטריך: סלקא דעתך אמינא ,תשבו' כעין תדורו-מה דירה איש ואשתו, אף סוכה איש ואשתו-קמשמע לן, B.2.b.1),irrelevant. There being no Rabbah, there is no problem, consequently no need of a solution. Moreover, the two parts of Abbaye's contribution, viz., the claim that sukka is a hilkheta, and the putative exegesis on Lev 23:42 (בסכות תשבו שבעת ימים) are both problematic. The former, because a hilkheta is not really necessary: we already have a general principle exempting women from positive time bound commandments (B.2.a.2). In the absence of Rabbah, that principle would satisfactorily counter the anonymous objection to the exclusionary midrash of האזרח in B.i.a. Indeed, the putative midrash credited there to Abbaye most likely did not originate with him : he had no reason to invent a null midrash in order to ac count for"Rabbah['since the latter is only a post-Amoraic ghost in our sugya. In addition, the substance of Abbaye's position, as well as the whole of Rava's position similar to his opponents (cf. b.Suk. 27a and y.Suk. 2:7 [fol. 53a],discussed in detail by Aminoah, op. cit., 223-27, n.46).</page><page sequence="23">[23] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 33 statement, are framed in argumentational language, viz. איצטריך ... סלקא דעתך אמינא ...קמשמע לן. This terminology is typical of the anonymous, i.e., Stam maitic or Savoraic product and characteristic of their interests.58 Therefore, we must entertain the possibility that Abbaye's contribution, along with the attribution to him, are pseudepigraphic. Actually, it would seem most likely that the Stammaim began with him. For the elements of Ab baye's midrashic construction would have been available in b.Sukka, as con veniently accessible to the redactors59as it is to us, in a baraita on b.Suk. 28b: "תשבו כעין תדורו"-מכאן אמרו כל שבעת הימים עושה אדם סוכתו קבע וביתו עראי. כיצד? היו לו כלים נאים, מעלן לסוכה-, מצעות נאות, מעלן לסוכה-, אוכל ושותה ומטייל בסוכה, 60.ומשנן בסוכה Still, it bears stating that pseudepigraphy is not a haphazard process : there is a reason that the null midrash from תשבו כעין תדורו was credited not to Rava, but to Abbaye. The path travelled by the composers of this sugya had already been beaten by Abbaye (or his tradents) and it was also from him that it led to Rava. This is because the application of Lev 2 3:4 2 in our sugya consists of a fur ther adaptation of Abbaye's own reuse of the above exegesis (on b.Suk. 26a) : שומרי גנות ופרדסים פטורים בין ביום ובין בלילה. וליעבדי סוכה התם וליתבו? אביי אמר: תשבו כעין תדורו. רבא אמר: פרצה קוראת לגנב. 61 but it,תשבו כעין תדורו In the above source, Abbaye alone is associated with (58) A.Cohen (דאי סלקא דעתך' לעומת ,סלקא דעתך אמינא' בבבלי",Sinai 99[1986]249-62): of the 34 instances that showed up in his sample, 31 were definitely anonymous and the remain ing three were probably so as well (pp. 258 f. and 259, n. 42). It should be noted that the term,"Stammaim," is showing up in contemporary literature where others, including moderns who elect not to use the terminology developed by D.Halivni, would prefer "Savoraim." Cf. n. 45 above and n. 119 below. (59) This proposition assumes that the raw material of this sugya had been collected and preserved in a (proto-)Talmud, i.e., Tannaitic and Amoraic traditions collected from various (oral and/or written) sources, with or without an original organization pattern, and arranged around the Mishnah (cf. n. 45 above). It was also used in Rovner, "Rhetorical Strategy,"();!), cit., 217 f., n.8 above, in order to elicit the compositional techniques of the redactors there. It will only become a certainty by being confirmed through the analysis of several more sugyot. (60) The baraita appears in a variant form in Sifra Emor Perek 17:5 (Weiss., [éd.] fol. 103a): ,,תשבו," ואין תשבו אלא כעין תדורו. מכאן אמרו: אוכל בסוכה, שותה בסוכה, ומטייל בסוכה, ומעלה כליו בסוכה. The latter form also appears in y.Suk. 2:9 (fol. 53b). (61) Regarding the first part of Abbaye's teaching, viz., לעולם סוכה הלכתא, it is possible that in uncovering possible links between Abbaye and halakhot le-mosheh mi-sinai, we can imagine the methods of Stammaitic pseudepigraphy more clearly. For instance,although the Aramaic form, הלכתא, is not characteristic of identifications of halakhot le-mosheh mi-sinai attributed to Abbaye,</page><page sequence="24">34 JAY ROVNER [24] is suggestive as well with regard to Rava's position in our suyga: Rava in this passage apparently disagrees with Abbaye of תשבו כעין תדורו 2.4. rava's role as abbaye's opposite Rava and Abbaye are traditionally paired in Talmudic dispute dialogues, a fact even noted in the Talmud ad loc.62 Moreover, a superficial reading of the exchange on b.Suk. 26a transcribed above could lead to the conclusion that Rava does not accept the exegesis of Lev 23:42 alluded to by Abbaye.63 Thus it is reasonable both that Rava would have been selected to appear as Ab baye's interlocutor and that he would not have been assigned Lev 23:42 as a source. Tracing Rava's gezerah shavah reveals yet once more the systematic methods of Stammaitic pseudepigraphy. Unlike Abbaye's material, Rava's has no parallel in Tannaitic sources, inside of the Talmud or outside of it.64 How ever, the redactors of our sugya also knew that the source of Abbaye's text (תשבו כעין תדורו) came paired with another exegetical tradition, both of which happened to have been associated with one another in the Talmud, again in conjunction with an adjacent Mishnah: מאי טעמא דרבי אליעזר? תשבו כעין תדורו all of which appear in Hebrew (cf. b.Sabb. 28b and 61a and M 35 a), n o n e th el e ss, i t is signifi cant that Abbaye has been credited with several claims of halakhot le-mosheh mi-sinai. Thus, the very association of Abbaye's name with that term suggests how the pseudepigraphers could have come to exploit the connection, preserving as well the likelihood that Abbaye's claim is not orig inal in Sukka, but is most probably pseudepigraphic. Indeed, in all the attributions to him of a claim of halakhot le-mosheh nu-sinai. Abbaye is concerned with only one subject, viz., phylacteries. (62) B.Suk. 28a. (63) Tosafot ad fol. 26a, s.v., פרצה קוראת לגנב, dispute such a construction, although Abra ham ben Azriel, 3 ,ספר ערוגת הבושם (Jerusalem, 1g62) 218, claims that Rava actually disputes Ab baye's application of the verse in their dispute, since the halakhah does not follow the rule of the the baraita as derived from תשבו כעין תדורו, for "אחרי שאינו מפורש בציוי," this constitutes 3מצוה" ".אחרת ולא מעכבי אם אינו מעלן [כלים הנאים] לסוכה פירוש קדום למסכת סוכה, דפים," published by Y.Kohen.h4/':17 ™'t'93/'9^1 (1990) 21-42, has construed Rava's position in our sugya as being in disagreement with Abbaye on several points. According to this interpretation, Rava, the speaker in B.i.b"(הלכתא נינהו ואסמכינו . . ."),disagrees with Abbaye who had claimed that the sukka exemption is a hilkheta; rather, Rava in B.2.b derives sukka from Scripture (קרא), and claims that the potential analogy with Pesah to include and obligate shows the need for a hilkheta(cf. 23-25). (64) However, the Sifra does contain gezerot shavot (analogies) based upon the number seven, (Emor, Perek 17:4[5] and 6 [fol. 103a] ).The location, right in the section dealing with Sukkot, is suggestive (whether of possible informational, quasi-textual or associational relations, cf. above n. 41 ). There is material on Sukkot here, and nearby (in Emor, Perek 14), on Vom Kippur Hnui, which also comes within the purview of this sugya. Moreover the Yerushalmi parallel (2:7, fol. 53a, cited n.56 above, and cf. the following note), compares dwelling in the sukka to the weeklong sep aration of Aaron and his sons into an analogous dwelling (tent, the Tabernacle) during their ini tiation period (ימי המילואים), as does the first Sifra source cited above,except that the Sifra bases the comparison on שבעת ימים.</page><page sequence="25">[25] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 35 ...ורבנן? ...אמר רבי יוחנן משום רבי שמעון בן יהוצדק: נאמר כאן חמשה עשר ונאמר חמשה עשר בחג המצות... (b.Suk.27a). Hence these parallel Sukkot teachings (from 2 7a to 28a) form a traditional pair.65 We have seen how naturally the sugya's creators, cognizant of Abbaye's prior association with the תשבו כעין תדורו material (§2.2),adapted that teach ing to the present context in Abbaye's own name66 It required but one more step of the imagination to link the parallel teaching (חמשה עשר/חמשה עשר), with the other member of a traditional pair, i.e., Rava.The Stammaim took that step and, so doing, created the midrashic disagreement between Abbaye and Rava that brings the discussion of Rabbah/ Rava's proposal to its dialectically successful conclusion. 2.5. CONCLUSIONS None of the attributed Amoraic statements can be original to this sugya. Rabbah's does not belong because the plural pronominal suffixes are in con flictflict with the present context which requires singular forms. The fact that the statement was originally credited to Rava is also problematic, but a minor is sue, one that probably involves a post-Talmudic, scribal, process?7Although Abbaye did not actually apply תשבו כעין תדורו to the question of women's Suk kot obligations, he had utilized it in the context of a different Sukkot discus sion,one which had been formulated as a dispute between himself and Rava. This served as a precedent for the redactors who originated the dispute be tween those two Amoraim in our sugya. Another contributing factor was the (65) The exegesis of R.Yohanan in the name of R.Shimon ben Yehosadak (transmitted in its Yerushalmi parallel by R.Yohanan in the name of R.Yishmael) is also paired there with a form of teaching based upon תשבו כעין תדורו, just as in b.Suk. 27a, except that a gezerah shavah is made there with תשבו in Lev 8:35: ופתח אוהל מועד תשבו יומם ולילה שבעת ימים (cf. the preceding note). (66) Abbaye's pseudepigraphic midrash was borrowed anonymously in b.cArak. 3b (repr. of Romm Vilna edition), although copyists may have changed it for the original baraita exegesis. The latter is preferred in the annotation oiShitah mekubeset,m the margin of Arakhin there,n.4 (and preferred by s. Atlas, קובץ מדעי לזכר משה שור ",לתולדות הסוגיא" (New York, ny, 1945) 6, where he calls the Abbaye version פירוש מאוחר"צ"); however, MSS London Additional 25717, Munich 95, Oxford Opp. 726, Vatican 119 and 120 all witness the version in the printed text in Arakhin). The Arakhin sugya therefore must also post-date this preliminary stage in our sugya, it could be valuable with respect to the identification and analysis of differences in textual lay ers of the Bavli. (67) Cf. MS and early printed readings cited above, n. 21. Rava's name also crept into medieval renditions of B.3.b.2(in a source that did not attribute to Rabbah in B.1.b),as well. These are in stances of a learned correction and an amplification, respectively, to make the argument seem more artfully natural (verisimilitude).Chronological disparity (Rava instead of Rabbah) would not have bothered the Stammaitic redactors themselves, for it is known that they did compose sugyot without regard to matters of chronology (cf. Hauptman, op.cit., n.45,on"non-linear inser tion of sources," 214 f.), especially by transferring material for topical purposes (cf. n. 47 above).</page><page sequence="26">36 JAY ROVNER [26] fact that Abbaye's exegetical reference was a member of a traditional pair of sukkasukka exegeses which could easily be adapted to the needs of our sugya. As could be expected, תשבו כעין תדורו was assigned to Abbaye who had previ ously been associated with it; the other position (סלקא דעתך אמינא יליף ,חמשה עשר'/,חמשר עשר' מחג המצות) was assigned to Rava by default. Although it works for the argument in our sugya, the midrash assigned to Rava could not actu ally have been used by him, for he holds that the commandment of sukka lasts for seven days, whereas the gezerah shava proves that only the first night is re quired, and it applies only to eating a meal, not dwelling in general. The foregoing critique of the attributions may be genuinely efficacious for any historically grounded analysis, such as a history of ritual life or the devel opment of halakhah, even for the literary history of components of this composition. However, it is subject to a major weakness: in and of itself, it is insufficient to account for the creation of the sugya®8 If anything, the sugya's argument as presently construed is but a hermeneutical house of cards : it col lapses quickly at the least breath of suspicion. Consider Rabbah's claim that sukka sukka sukka is a halakhah le-mosheh mi-sinai, האזרח להוציא את הנשים merely an asmakhta. On the argument of the sugya, the hilkheta was necessitated because the puta tive exegesis of Abbaye or Rava conflicted with the general feminine ex emption rule, leaving jurists in doubt as to the intent of the Torah here with regard to the nature of women's involvement in sukka: the hilkheta was accord ingly revealed to clarify that primacy should be assigned to the general ex emption, rather than the contrary discrete exegesis. However, that exegesis has been shown to be inauthentic. Absent the exegesis, there is no conflict of laws, the hilkheta is superfluous, and the sugya has become a facile specimen of Stammaitic sleight of hand. To be sure, the reality is more nuanced than that. We have yet to under stand the way in which this sugya was formed, to grasp its generative problem atic. But for that we will need to probe deeper into its complications and de velop paradigms that will illustrate how they could have come about, in the next section. 3. Generative Problematic of the Sugya 3.1.3.1. diminishment of baraitot and other early teachings Under critical analysis, this sugya appears problematic indeed. One crucial problem has already been mentioned (at the end of § 2.5 above). Several other (68) It is for this reason that the present writer feels that, valuable as they may be, studies of individual forms must always be integrated into the study of the sugya in its entirety. A line in a sugya must be related to others in a way in which both synchronic phenomena and diachronic</page><page sequence="27">[27] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 37 aspects of this sugya are troubling as well. For instance, the authors' treatment of the two baraitot cited in A.t.b and B.i.a, both undoubtedly members of an ancient pool of Tannai tic traditions, and probably associated together in con nection with this Mishnahf is puzzling. The Tannaitic exegesis in the baraita on Sukkot, whose pedigree is confirmed by a parallel in the Sifra, is reduced to a mere asmakhtaJ° The teaching of the Yom Kippur baraita does not fare much better : it is diverted from a significant general application (women's in elusion in 'inui) and confined by its Stammaitic handlers to a minutely dis crete usage (women's inclusion in tosefet 'inui). In another similar shift of mentalities,one finds a rule originally developed to extend the same rights and responsibilities to women as to men in the area of criminal and civil law now applied to fine points of religious practice (B.2.a.2 on Yom Kippur).71 3.2. DIFFICULTIES OF THE SUGYA Problematic as well is the complex of questions posed in (B.2.a), for the diffi culties raised therein are actually in conflict. Our original problem had to do with contradictory readings of the term האזרח (B.i.a).Rabbah tried to resolve this issue (B.i.b).The first difficulty raised in B. 2.a continues this line of think ing : it merely wants to know which festival law is really a hilkheta, etc. Accord ing to this point of view, both baraitot continue to teach something about rit ual law as it affects men and women ,sukka taught as an asmakhta,'inui as a basic Scriptural teaching. In contrast, the second difficulty raised there (B.2.a.2) rips the sugya apart, challenging its very assumptions with the revelation that the application of Scripture in both the sukka baraita (according to Rabbah) and the Yom Kippur baraita are superfluous. The sugya would flow much more smoothly if, e.g., B. 2.a, the attack on Rab bah's proposed solution, were split up and presented seriatim, with Abbaye's answer (B.2.b.1) divided likewise. In the following suggested sequence, Rab bah (B.2 below) comes to answer the initial question, the application of his claim is clarified (C.1 below), and only then is it attacked (separately in D.1 ) : א.1 מנא הני מילי? א.2 דתנו רבנן: ,,,האזרח' - אזרח-, ,האזרח' - להוציא את הנשים-, ,כל' - לרבות את הקטנים." relationships may be identified; otherwise, we will not understand how the Talmud was created.

It indeed seems puzzling that the Bavli, renowned for its argumentational skill, did not organize the sugya as above. Upon reflection one realizes that there is a very good reason that it did not do so. There are two74sugyot here, an early one (pair) and a secondary one that builds on it. A dialectical struc ture that in retrospect seems counterintuitively clumsy, actually reveals the course of its genesis and subsequent development. The following hypothet ical constructions will serve as heuristic models of how sugyot such as ours may develop. (72) On the understanding that לעולם סוכה הלכתא is an interpolation into Abbaye's state ment in the original sugya, the present line could be anonymous. (73) Yom Kippur notice added per the (probably amplified) version, cited by Spanish Ris honim (see n. 28 above). (74) It is possible that there are actually three sugyot here, i.e., that the argumentation con cerning the Yom Kippur material (cited in §3.3 Rationalization of Duplicate Sources, immediately below) actually existed as an independent sugya, contemporaneous with the earliest layer of Sukka argumentation. The other possibility is that it was invented by the second level Stammaitic redactor(s) of this sugya. I favor the second possibility, both because the difficulty raised in B.2.a from איש או אשה (cf. n. 116 below) is so close to the approach and concern that led those second level Stammaitic redactors to compose this sugya, and because the solution at B.3-b.2 is at once so brilliantly pre cious. This conclusion is also supported by the rhetorical structure and dialectical terminology (cf. the parallel strategy in b.Nid. 32 which is presented at the end of §3.3 Solution of one prob lem, below).</page><page sequence="29">[2g] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 39 3.3. ARGUMENTATION In order to appreciate how the dialectical treatment of this material would develop under normal circumstances, we will concentrate on selected seg ments of the sugya. Rationalization Rationalization of duplicate sources. The Yom Kippur portion of our sugya shows how easy a simple conflict between two competing legal sources can be treated. Again, I am selecting material from our sugya, retaining the original numbering so that it may be located easily within the overall composition. ב.1.א תניא: ,,,האזרח' - לרבות את הנשים האזרחיות, שחייבות בעינוי." ב.2.א.1 קרא למה לי...יום הכפורים מדרב יהורה אמר רב נפקא, דאמר רב יהודה אמר רב, וכן תנא דבי רבי ישמעאל: ,,אמר קרא: ,איש או אשה'- השווה הכתוב אשה לאיש לכל עונשים שבתורה"?! ב.3.ב.2 לא נצרכה אלא לתוספת עינוי: סלקא דעתך אמינא הואיל ומיעט רחמנא לתוספת עינוי מעונש ומאזהרה, לא נתחייבו נשים כלל - קמשמע לן. The above strategy, consisting of the citation of a Tannai tic midrash to source a specific ritual law which is then attacked on the basis of a generalized rule and finally shown upon further analysis to be necessary, has been used in a sugya on the positive time-bound exemption, viz., b.Hagigah 4a concerning re'iyahre'iyahre'iyah (the commandment to appear in Jerusalem on Pilgrimage Festivals!5 This rhetorical model is fine if one has only two sources to account for. Where the tradition supplies three, the argument becomes more complicated. Rationalization Rationalization of triplicate sources. We will take up a problem of two compet ing sources like the one preceding, except that we will make it more difficult of resolution by not allowing a solution that diverts the baraitals exegesis to another matter; instead, the introduction of a third source to solve the con tradiction between the first two will be required. An example could be, e.g., the specific feminine exemption from sukka opposed to the overall rule of feminine exemption from positive time-bound commandments (including sukka),sukka), with the assumption that apparently duplicate sources each have a function within the halakhic economy. In order tojustify the duplication,we will need to oppose another source that teaches the opposite rule. This will 75) The text of the argument, with key shared dialectical terminology italicized, runs as) תנו רבנן: "זכור" להוציא את הנשים ... : follows אמר מר: זכור להוציא את הנשים-הא למה לי קרא, מכדי מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא הוא וכל מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא נשים פטורות. אצטריך, סלקא דעתך אמינא נילף ראיה ראיה מהקהל-מה להלן נשים חייבות אף כאן נשים חייבות, קמשמע לן.</page><page sequence="30">4-0 JAY ROVNER [30] create a conflict with the one of the primary sources, thereby requiring the other primary source to solve this conflict. Again, I have retained the original numbering for ease of reference. משנה: נשים ועבדים וקטנים פטרין מן הסוכה ... ... גמרא: א.1.א מנא הני מילי? א.1.ב דתנו רבנן: ,"אזרח' - זה אזרח־, ,האזרח' - להוציא את הנשים־, ,כל' - לרבות את הקטנים." ב.2.א.2 הא סוכה מצות עשה שהזמן גרמה, וכל מצות עשה שהזמן גרמה נשים פטורות?! ב.2.ב.1 אמר אביי: ,,איצטריך: סלקא דעתך אמינא ,תשבו' כעין תדורו- תדורו מה דירה איש ואשתו, אף סוכה איש ואשתו - קמשמע לן." ב.2.ב.2 רבא אמר: ,,איצטריך: סלקא דעתך אמינא יליף ,חמשה עשר'/,חמשר עשר' מחג המצות - מה להלן נשים חייבות, אף כאן נשים חייבות - קמשמע לן." According to the above argument, although women are exempted from Suk ka because it is a positive time-bound commandment (B.2.a.2),it is possible to conclude from the midrashim of Abbaye and Rava (B.2.b) that sukka is an exception to this rule. For that reason, the verse at A.i.b is necessary merely to show that Abbaye's and Rava's midrashim do not represent valid halakhah, and that sukka follows the general rule. At this point, theoretical discussion and textual reality coalesce, for the pre ceding selection of lines from our sugya have in effect recovered an actual Babylonian Talmudic sugya. It had disappeared into the transformed sugya of b.Suk. 28, but its traces have been preserved in b. Qidd. 34a-b:76 והרי סוכה דמצות עשה שהזמן גדמא, דכתיב: ,,בסכות תשבו שבעת ימים',' טעמא: דכתב רחמנא ,,האזרח" להוציא את הנשים-הא לאו הכי, נשים חייבות?77 אמר אביי: איצטריך: סלקא דעתך אמינא הואיל דכתיב ,,בסכות תשבו"-תשבו, כעין תדורו, מה דירה איש ואשתו, אף סוכה איש ואשתו ורבא אמר: אצטריך: סלקא דעתך אמינא: נילף ,,חמשה עשר"/"חמשה עשר" מחג המצות, מה להלן נשים חייבות, אף כאן נשים חייבות, צריכא. (76) The sugya was known to the authors of b.Qidd. 34-35 as a foreign text because it was in a list of positive time bound commandments, a list that contained only items known to have undergone topically relevant midrashic exposition (cf. "Rhetorical Strategy," op. cit., n. 8 above, 191 f. and n. 27 there). (77) The point is that, without Scripture, we would not know that women are exempt, which proves that there is no generalized feminine exemption rule (as our sugya put it, in B.2.a.2: הא</page><page sequence="31">[31] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 41 The two sugyot are identical, except that where ours, assuming the general exemption, questions the need for Scripture, the Qiddusin version assumes Scripture and questions the need for the general rule. Either way, both Ab baye's and Rava's midrashim furnish potential contrary constructions of the law as a functional demonstration of the need for the questioned authority to break the halakhic deadlock.'8 Solution Solution of one problem. Having demonstrated the existence of an anony mous sugya which possesses elements identical to ours, the connection with b.Qidd.b.Qidd. 34 helps solve two of the problems with the Sukkot sugya. These are the irrationality of having Rabbah propose a hilkheta (B.x.b) in the absence of Abbaye's and Rava's exegetical material (§ 2.5), and the complicated question on Rabbah (B.2.a), in which questions are asked out of order (§3.2). It should be noted that the anonymous sugya in b.Qidd. 34 was adapted from a context like that of b.Suk. 28 at a certain point in time. The existence of this sugya is confirmed by the inclusion of sukka in the elaborate summa tional sugya on the feminine exemption from time-bound commandments found in b. Qidd. 34-3 5. The framers of that sugya drew exclusively upon com mandments that had been dealt with in sugyot elsewhere in the Bavli.79 It is this original anonymous Sukkot sugya that was subsequently modified in its original locus (now, b.Suk. 28). With this two step solution in hand, every thing falls into place. Now it is clear that: 1. Rabbah's assertion was imported into a preexisting sugya,one where Abbaye's and Rava's pseudepigraphic null exegeses appeared as given data; 2. the question at B. 2.a, originally simple and uncomplicated - הא סוכה מצות עשה שהזמן גרמה וכל מצות עשה שהזמן גרמה נשים פטורות — became extremely involved and selfcontradictory as a result of the threefold expansion of the original query, when several new problems were superimposed onto the original query (cf. the version of B.2.a.2 in § 3.2.3 above, for the sugya's present form). The following text represents the sugya, only this time the original layer .(סוכה מצות עשה שהזמן גרמה, וכל מצות עשה שהזמן גרמה נשים פטורות?! (78) An alternative conjecture would be that the exegeses of Abbaye and Rava originated in Qiddusin along with the entire first level sugya, whence that composition was transferred to Sukkot. This hypothesis is not satisfactory for several reasons, primarily because the pseudepi graphic pair of exegeses attributed to Abbaye and Rava was fashioned out of material in Sukkot (cf. § 2.3-2.4 above). This is analogous to the way that material from the overall context in Qid dusindusin was adapted to construct the derivation of the overall feminine exemption from time bound commandments in the first unit of b.Qidd.34-35 (cf. "Rhetorical Strategy;204-9 '). An other indication that the direction of borrowing leads from Sukkot to Qiddusin is the fact that sukkasukka appears in Qiddusin in a list of commandments all of which had sugya material adapted from elsewhere in the Talmud for use in b.Qidd. 34-35. In this allusive way, the sugya from b.Suk. 28 became local, as a foreign text, in Qiddusin (cf. the following note). (79) Cf.

The second-level additions, i.e., those that transformed the sugya, contain ele ments that occur elsewhere in the Stammaitic repertoire as well as materials (80) It seems odd that קרא had up to this point been used to designate the source for the rit ual practice which was not governed by a hilkheta, i.e. Yom Kippur (cf. B.1.b-B.2.a), whereas in B-3 the opposite is the case. Here, קרא refers to Sukkot, while the situation of Yom Kippur is ref erenced by naming the authorities behind that tradition (Rav Yehudah amar Rav). One could easily conclude that this indexing difference exposes a"seam"and that the two applications come from different textual layers. However, this is unlikely, as the same shift in application comes in the related sugya, b.Nid. 32a-b, as maybe seen by examining both selections brought from there, immediately below.</page><page sequence="33">[33] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 43 unique to this particular sugya. Among the unique materials are the Yom Kippur baraita ofB.i.aand the two universal rules in B.2.a,as well as the con eluding solutions provided at B.3.a.1-end. The elements also found else where, viz., dialectical maneuvers, constitute proof that this group of mate rials was added, as a unit, onto the pre-existing sugya. For they occur together in a sugya that, like ours, imported the Rabbah / Rava claim from b. Qidd. ga (אלא אמר רבא: הלכתא נינהו ואסמכינהו רבנן אקראי) in order to manipulate the tra ditions of b.Nid. 31b-32b. Comparison with the following pair of sequences from there demonstrates that almost all of the argumentation added by the late redactors here in Sukka was also added by them in Niddah : Passage 1: b.Nid. 32a-b. The dialogue has been arranged in pairs, each con taining a problem and its solution, separated by a blank line from the sue ceeding pair; rhetoric common to b.Suk. 28 is italicized. א.1 אלמא, כי מרבי קרא, בת יום אחד מרבי - ורמינהו: "אשה"81- אין לי אלא אשה, תינוקת בת ג' שנים ויום אחד לביאה מנין? ת"ל: "ואשה.''82 א.2 אמר רנא: הלכתא נינהו, ואסמכינהו רבנן אקראי. ב.1 הי קרא והי הלכתא ב.2 אילימא בת יום אחד הלכתא, בת שלש שנים ויום אחד קרא, קרא סתמא כתיב•, אלא, בת ג' שנים ויום אחד - הלכתא, בת יום אחד - קרא. ג.1 ומאחר דהלכתא, קרא ל"ל? ג.2 למעוטי איש מאודם.

Alternatively, one might hypothesize that both sugyot underwent subsequent editorial ex pansion. The first suggestion has the advantages of linkage with an intellectual scholastic pro gram identified in §4.3. Thus, application of the wholistic approach to redaction and source criti cism exemplified in this study, insofar as it examines individual segments in the context of the dialectical and rhetorical structure of the overall sugya, can lead one to different conclusions than traditional philological criticism would when it focuses exclusively upon distinct linguistic and scribal phenomena as they occur within discrete units (cf. n.t21 below).

Both of the above passages, segments of an extremely involved and evidently similarly late sugya/'deliver three sets of questions and answers. The similari ties to b.Suk. 28 are striking. In both passages a contradiction between two Tannaitic midrashim is identified (cf. b.Suk. 2 8, B. 1 .a) ; that contradiction is re solved by means of Rava's hilkheta/asmakhta claim (imported from b.Qidd. ga; cf. ô.Sw&amp;.B.1.b).The redactor then asks which Tannaitic rule maybe sourced in a hilkheta and which is Scriptural (cf. b.Suk. B.2.a, first question: הי קרא והי הלכתא), and the solution is then supplied (cf. Sukka's adaptation of Abbaye and and Rava, under the interpolated heading: לעולם סוכה הלכתא, b.Suk., B.2.b). Fi nally, a primary halakhic function of the passage which has been demoted to asmakhta status is identified (B.3.a.1-2 paralleled by B.3-b.1-2). 3.4. SUMMARY OF SOLUTIONS FOR SUGYAT SUKKA Severe problems have been raised right at the heart of sugyat b.Suk. 28a-b, in those crucial units B.i.b and B.2.a.If Abbaye's and Rava's pseudepigraphic null midrashim had not yet been composed, and if therefore there had been no conflict of laws on the table, then Rabbah / Rava's hilkheta assertion would make no sense. Moreover, that assertion seemed to dialectically generate a self-contradictory set of problems, the first of which accepted Rabbah/Rava's assertion, while the second rejected it. The former problem would have been solved if Abbaye's and Rava's null midrashim had already existed; the sec ond problem would disappear were the sugya to have been more logically organized. The phenomenon of a two tiered sugya would solve both problems. For then Rabbah/Rava would have been imported from b.Qidd. ga subsequent to the formation of a sugya containing the pseudepigraphic null midrashim. The structural problems fall into place as well, for the redactors were con servative enough to leave the preexisting material as it was, choosing but to (85) Unfortunately, in the absence of an intensive investigation of the style and substance of b.Nid.b.Nid. 31-32, the claim is circular. The fact that the rhetorical and dialectical patterns are vir tually identical proves either that, since Sukka must be extremely late, we are only discussing its most recent, secondary, layer, Niddah is as well, or that Sukka, a more recent production, bor rowed and adapted the strategy of the earlier Niddah sugya, which in turn had borrowed a ker nel from b.Qidd. 9a. I prefer the first alternative, because of the many parallels between the two sugyot (cf. nn. 22 and 39 above).</page><page sequence="35">[35] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 45 interpolate their own contributions into the previous construction. In so doing they transformed a comparatively simple sugya whose concern was a redundancy of rules (discrete sukka exemption versus a generalized ex emption rule) into a highly abstract essay. Traditional modes of reverence for their ancient sources were thrown aside : a Tannaitic midrash was demoted to the status of asmakhta, a standard Yom Kippur baraita was shorn of its con tents and side-railed, and a hoary hilkheta was invented not recovered !, end products of a logical compulsion set in motion by the rigid argumentational methods of its scholastic redactors. The fact that this redaction-critical exer cise has identified differences in approach between two anonymous groups of of Talmudic redactors each of which produced a distinct literary layer is sig nificant. It gives depth to our understanding of Stammaitic processes, pro vides clues as to when the Talmud was formed, and aids in both characteriz ing and particularizing the nature of the editorial aims and methods of the Talmud's authors. 4. Conclusions 4.1.4.1. FORMATION OF THE TALMUD The The nature of the préexistent Talmud. When assessing the impact of late anony mous redaction upon their Talmudic sources, there seem to be two ways to think about the way in which the Talmud was formed : either the received text represents the final product of a long, accretive process or else it consists of the thoroughly revised production of its final editor-redactors. On the evi dence of literary phenomena such as textual interpolations, the members of the philological school86 may imagine that, e.g., the Stammaim were in pos session of fully formed textual traditions which they updated as necessary.87 On the other hand, contemporary historians, such as J. Neusner and his school, looking at the text of an attributed statement,especially in the light of cognate versions in other Rabbinic documents, can conclude that the Stam maim and later glossators were no respecters of attributions or quotational boundaries; not only did they allow themselves to interpolate their own ma terial into the statements of others, they manipulated and modified those ver bal traditions at will, silently and anonymously.88 This dispute can only be solved through the intensive analysis of the evi dence: the integrated (oral-)literary compositions (sugyot) crafted by the (86) Textual critics such as S.Y. Friedman (cf. the material cited above, n. 46, and"1pn על דרך הסויא"הסויא" op. cit., 283-308, n. 4 above) and D. Halivni, מקורות ומסורות: באורים בתלמוד, מסכת בבא קמאקמא (Jerusalem, 1993)16-19. Cf. nn.89 and 99 below. (87) On the formation of the Talmud, cf. n. 45 above. (88) Cf., e.g., the consequences taken by, e.g., Avery-Peck and Lightstone referred to in n. 1 above.</page><page sequence="36">46 JAY ROVNER [36] redactors of the Talmud themselves. This is because the theory of authorship as interpolation, even if it is adequate as a descriptive critical technique in many individual situations, obscures the revolutionary nature of the overall Stammaitic program(s),viewing as subservient to the Amoraic component an effort that actually transformed it, imposing new meaning on sacred tradition or perhaps better, eliciting new meaning from it, in the same way that a lus trous gem shows very differently when placed in the context of a new setting. Taking b.Suk. 28 as an example, we can identify two strikingly different ways in which tradition has been preserved, yet transmuted. The exegetical burden of the Sukkabaraita has been preserved: האזרח in Lev 23:42 continues to ex elude women (from sukka) — now as an asmakhta; women continue to be in eluded by האזרח (Lev 16:29) in the teaching of the Yom Kippur baraita, how ever the inclusion has been carefully refined and limited to a discrete aspect of 'inui, viz., tosefet 'inui. But even more important is the fact that the latest augmentation left a pre vious literary product, the original Stammaitic sugya, in its pristine formula tion, easily recoverable from the new context supplied by the latest editors. The implication may be drawn that the latest redactors left many other Stam maitic and even Amoraic sugyot untouched (see below), and glossed others and even modified them, but all are similarly easy to recover. Formation Formation of sugyot. When we ask about the formation of sugyot, at least two questions are involved. One is, when sugyot were formed; a second is, when were they combined into a Talmud, that is, when were a set of discussions and traditions delivered in a variety of settings organized to follow the order of the Mishnah and subordinated to the latter. Clearly any opinions based upon the preceding analysis must be provisional, open to revision as the evi dence accumulated in the analysis of other sugyot provides more data. On the basis of the above analysis, we can posit at least two levels of post-Amoraic (anonymous) composition of sugyot?9 viz., the pseudepigraphic effort which, (8g) This implies that the image of oral crafting of sugyot so carefully described by E.S. Rosen thai, requires slight modification. According to Rosenthal, redaction took place in two stages. First, the general outlines of the sugya were laid out, an activity that could have taken place in different schools each of which, working with a similar set of traditions, could have produced dissimilar sugyot (cf. "';ללשונותיה של מסכת תמורה Tarto 58[1g8g]317-56). Following that, succès sive editors refined and modified the formulation (cf. "תולדות הנוסח ובעיות-עריכה בחקר התלמוד הבבלי," Tarbiz his views are discussed by S. Y. Friedman in "להתהוות שינויי הגירסאות בתלמוד הבבלי,"op. cit., n. to above, who observed that it is impossible to separate these two stages since one cannot set the structure except through the medium of verbal formulation, irrespec tive of extended competition between relative fixedness and fluidity [p. 97 f.J). In light of the present findings as well as those of several others (cf. n. 11 above), it is suggested that the sugyot were not simply reworked through the augmentation of editorial improvements; rather, some were constructed and subsequently rebuilt in stages: later editors, with new purposes and goals,</page><page sequence="37">[37] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 47 restored by comparison with its parallel in b.Qidd. 34, is a fully formed sugya in its own right, and the far-reaching revision that replaced it in b.Suk. 28.90 would rework predecessor Stammaitic producdons as well as the Talmud of the Amoraim. The Talmud as we know it, for all of its variations, would seem to be one basic work. However, evidence that sugyot, and even groups of sugyot, all built upon the foundations of the same "proto-Talmud," were structured differently, force upon us the recognition that, between the Amoraim and the glossatorial Sevoraim, more than one group, all working with common con vendons and to similar ends, had contracted to construct the traditions into sugyot. E.S. Rosen thai (ללשונותיה של מסכת תמורה"," Tarbiz 58[1g89]317-56)and A.Schremer (בין מסורת עריכה" למסורת-נוסח: מהדורה אחרת של בבלי מועד קטן מן הגניזה)" Tarte 62[1991/19921375-99; "לישנא '»^,(17-61ג[1993]9»^&gt;&amp;"אחרינא למסכת מועד קטן מן הגניזה example,have demonstrated the ex istence of alternative editions of the Bavli containing anonymous (late) sugyot different in struc ture and to some extent as well in the fixed text traditions preserved through incorporation into the discussion. A recent dispute over the Status Quaestionis of research in rabbinic literature has centered on the question of redaction (see P. Schâfer, "Research into Rabbinic Literature : an Attempt to De fine the Status Quaestionis,"JJS37(1986] 139-52, joined by C.Milikowsky,"The Status Quaestionis of Research in Rabbinic Literature,"//!» 3g[1g88]201-11, and rejoined by Shàfer,"Once Again the Status Quaestionis of Research in Rabbinic Literature: an Answer to Chaim Milikowsky','//S 40[1g8g]89-95). Uncertainty with respect to the role of oral transmission complicates the de termination of when the Talmud was redacted, extending the process to the last Geonim if not into the Medieval European manuscript tradition (cf. especially the last two articles, pp. 208 f. and 90 f., respectively). The authors touch upon the factor of the redaction of discrete literary units as distinct from the entire work; another significant factor mentioned is that differences of genre (mysticism versus midrash) and setting (the Talmudic academy versus the mystics' cir cle) may imply redaction of adifferent nature. Indeed,further clarification is required regarding the formation of the sugyot and, in addition, the way in which that stage relates to the forma tion of the Talmud. Also, the fact that a text may be open to glossatorial amplification does not necessarily mean, in cheirographic terms, that it has not yet been redacted. (90) It must be acknowledged that b.Suk. 28 and b.Qidd. 34-35 contradict one another, for the latter attributes the exemption from sukka to the generalized feminine exemption from posi five time-bound commandments, whereas the former anchors it in a hilkheta. Since both sugyot are late, and treat the same issues, share the same attitudes, and use many of the same techniques, it is probable that both sugyot emanate from the same period. Thus, the problem has greater ur gency since it occurs in the same layer of Talmudic composition ; moreover, it conflicts with the impression of intrusive and extensive control created by the rigidity of this group of authors. Redactorial awareness of the contradiction is not indicated (similar to what H. Lapin observed in contradictions and tensions between Mishnaic passages, noted below), which is different from the forthright juxtaposition of disputes in Tannai tic and Amoraic texts (cf. n. 95, below). Although a casuistic solution to this problem maybe considered, e.g., b.Suk. 28 was intended only according to Rava/ Rabbah's hilkheta proposition, two more reasonable alternatives may be considered. Still problematic, they provide a greater approximation of the way these sugyot may be understood. Possibly, one can acknowledge the ad hoc nature of the composers' mindset, i.e., they think and operate locally, not globally or holistically, following oral modalities of thinking (cf. "Rhetorical Strategy," op. cit., 218 f., n. 90, and n. 8 above). Alternatively, these compositions are by no means final summations of Rabbinic wisdom ; they are, rather, dialectical experiments, carefully crafted rhetorical exercises. Decisors have certainly chosen to ignore many Talmudic</page><page sequence="38">48 JAY ROVNER [38] The preference of the first level authors for utilizing material front other loci in b.Sukka chapter two91 in the creation of this sugya suggests that a Tal mud containing related Tannaitic baraitot, Amoraic mimrot and disputes was in place when they initiated their authorial project.92 This tallies nicely with another extremely complex exposition on the feminine exemption (from all positive time-bound commandments), b. Qâ&amp;f. 34-35. The authors of that sugya also drew upon available lists (specific time-bound mitsvot,etc.) and ma terial on the commandments of Torah study and Mezuzah. Although no at tempt was made to distinguish between layers of anonymous composition in a previous study of that sugya93 the artificial construct created therein stands in striking contrast to the anonymous sugyot on individual commandments rationalizations and, according to Ch. Albeck, the recognition that not all solutions are to be taken seriously, goes back to the Amoraim themselves (cf. "','אין סומכים על דיוני הגמרא למעשה 56־545 ,מבוא התלמודים)• H. Lapin (Early Rabbinic Civil Law and the Social History of Roman Galilee : a Study ofMishnah Trac tatetate Baba Mesi'a' [Atlanta, GA, 1995] 40L) has noted that conflicts between Mishnah passages, whether identified within that tractate or by comparison with passages from elsewhere in the Mishnah, may indeed be attributable to contradiction. Interestingly, this may not have troubled the redactors, for "it is not impossible that a harmonizing interpretation could already be pre supposed in the juxtaposition of these passages" (p. 40). Lapin also found that the tensions may often be diffused by tracing the origins of the passages to different sources and/or reconstruct ing the original, diverse, frames of reference which gave rise to the differing formulations. (91) As set out in §2.3 and §2.4 above, on (he development of Rava's and Abbaye 's positions. One foreign component is the exegesis that includes women in all negative precepts, based upon Num 5:6: איש או אשה (B.2.a). We have advanced the propositions that Stammaim draw on local material in composing (as did the authors of b.Qidd. 34-35, as described in "Rhetorical Strategy," 204 f.; cf. n.78 above) and that their mindset is local and ad hoc (cf. the previous n.). Their utilization of non-local material would seem to dispute this working hypothesis. Perhaps, therefore, we must also propose that there are certain items on the agenda of the redactors: those will show up in many loci. The Numbers exegesis appears several times in the Bavli, in Stammaitic sugyot ( Pesah 43a, Yeb. 84b, Qidd. 35a-b = B. Qam. 15a, Tem. 2b, Nid. 48b). (92) The integrated Talmud of the Stammaim maybe a direct result of the (recently) formed proto-Talmud (cf. 45 above and n.ng below). The following observation of F. M.Cross Jr. with respect to the process of integration of manuscript readings may have an application with re spect to the Stammaitic project: "when textual families are detected, each with a particular series of special readings or traits, it must be postulated that such textual families arose in separate localities, or in any case, in complete isolation. . . .When manuscripts stemming from different textual traditions come into contact, the result is their dissolution into a mixed text or the pre cipitation of a textual crisis which results in recensional activity . . ." ("The Contributions of the Qumran Discoveries to the Study of the Biblical Text,"/£/16 [ tg6G) 87, cited in Friedman, "להתהוות שינויי הגירסאות בתלמוד הבבלי,"«^. cit.,n. 10 above). By analogy, the formation of an inte grated proto-Talmud in late Amoraic times, when conflicting and duplicate teachings were jux taposed, may have precipitated a taxonomic crisis which resulted in the recensional activity manifest in Stammaitic sugyot (cf. nn. 101-2 below). (93) "Rhetorical Strategy,"op. cit., n. 8 above.</page><page sequence="39">[39] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 49 assembled there and incorporated into that culminating Talmudic exposition of this important ritual principle. This certainly suggests that at least two stages of anonymous creation may with little difficulty be recovered from that sugya as well. The identification of two layers of anonymous composition may provide a basis on which to begin to characterize two very different authorial ap proaches on the part of two groups of anonymous Talmudic redactors, and to infer distinctive historical roles for them. Since their work exists in different textual layers,one presupposing the other such that they cannot be conceived of merely as parallels made to converge in the course of editorial revision, a diachronic difference is implied. The implications of this characterization will be explored below. 4-2. PSEUDEPIGRAPHERS The first level sugya, i.e., that concerned only with the conflict between a general rule for women and a specific exemption from sukka, forms a dis crete and reverential production. Evidendy initiating a comprehensive review of received traditions, possibly out of a concern to collect and collate them, but more probably in the course of the ensuing redactional stage, viz., that of reflecting upon those previously collected traditions, these redactors, worked under a new assumption, viz., that their reconstructed Rabbinic tradition forms an integral whole. The very existence of such a collection was empow ering: it enabled a comprehensiveness of vision heretofore unimagined.94 But the formation of the collection had threatening consequences as well : juxtaposed in proximity, sources could be compared more systematically than heretofore; dialectical tension developed among the members of the collec tion. Duplicate teachings could not be tolerated as historical souvenirs, rem nants of diverse ways of accomplishing the same thing.95 Sources perceived as redundant had to be rationalized in some way, whether by differentiation96 (94) Cf. n.92 above; cf. the final paragraph of n.11 above as well. It is important, in develop ing a conception of the Talmud as a textualization of oral traditions in the Amoraic and post Amoraic academies, to bear in mind that the particular textualization manifest largely in the form of the sugyot known to the Geonim, to the later Medievals and to us, does not at all repre sent the form that the Talmud could have taken (a proto-Talmud would be the latest form an Amoraic Talmud could take) before the Stammaim. (95) In contrast, a paradigm for the toleration of divergent views (as opposed to duplicate tra ditions),ditions), would be the (presumably) Amoraic tradental policy to formulate differing Amoraic teachings as disputes using the citation term איתמר, which itself follows a predilection to pre serve differing teachings manifest in Tannaitic compositions. (96) J. Kugel has introduced the term,"omnisignificance)' to signify this phenomenon. This " basic assumptiom underlying all of rabbinic exegesis [is] that the slightest details of the biblical text have a meaning that is both comprehensible and significant. . . Every detail is put there to</page><page sequence="40">50 JAY ROVNER [4&lt;י] or by demonstrating hermeneutical necessity. In the case of b.Suk. 28, where a general and a specific rule converged, it was not deemed satisfactory to di vide them among different cases?7The solution was found, rather, in demon strating the hermeneutical necessity of all sources; they were harmonized dialectically in the resulting sugya.98 It is important to note that this first group of anonymous redactors main tains respect for the integrity of its sources ; it refrains from meddling in their contents even as it manipulates them?9 Thus a way was found to resolve the teach something new and important, and it is capable of being discovered by careful analysis" (The Idea (The Idea of Biblical Poetry : Parallelism and its History [New Haven, CT, 1981] 103-4, cited ■n Y. El man,'"It is no Empty Thing': Nahmanides and the Search for Omnisignificance" The Torah u-Maddau-MaddaJournal 4 [1993] 1; cf. Elman, ibid., 1-5). (97) "Omnisignificance"means that "in classic rabbinic texts, apparent redundancies and duplications are interpreted casuistically, so as to draw distinctions between apparently similar, identical or contradictory phrases, verses or passages" (Elman, op.at., 4). It should be noted that "omnisignificance"may include the allocation of unique hermeneutical functions to duplicate traditions without deriving separate halakhic applications from them (or: without assigning sep arate halakhic applications to them). (98) D. Kraemer,"New Readings in the Bavli"ConservativeJudaism42(1990)48-53,proposes a different rationale for the similar discussion in b.Qidd.34,viz.,the implication that a multiplie ity of halakhic alternatives are possible "subverts the absolute standing of the law of the Mish nah[,legitimating]'creativenah[,legitimating]'creativebetrayal'. . . as . . . alegitimatetraditionaljewish/rabbinicstrategy" (p.(p. 52 f. ; I thank J. Hauptman for this reference). Kraemer's analysis makes room for a feminist (egalitarian) reading. It is indeed intriguing that neither in b.Suk. 28 nor in b.Ber. 20b (the main text analyzed there) does the Talmud examine the halakhic status of male slaves (mentioned along with women in the sugya's source Mishnah), as it does the situation of women. The differ ences between the findings set out in this article and Kraemer's bear interest to the nature of interpretation, especially since both assessments focus "on the talmudic sugya as a whole, ac counting for the details as they work together in the broader context. Particular attention is given to the rhetoric of the Gemara" ( Kraemer, 48). Perhaps the methodological distinctions drawn in other contexts in Rabbinic literature by David Stern, Midrash and Theory: Ancient Jewish Exegesis and Contemporary Literary Studies (Evan ston, IL, 1996), could well be adapted to the critical treatment of the Talmudic sugya, whether in terms of which questions we imagine it asking, or what message we find expressed in its lan guage.guage. Cf.,e.g., p.50(there)0n "[legitimate] questions that the mashal does notanswer . . . [be cause] these questions actually lie beyond the mashal's own ken, the limits of its own compre hension. They are situated precisely at the farthest end of what we might call the mashal's theological horizon." With respect to the question of the message implied by the text alluded to above, Stern, upon sensing that a midrash had been framed without reference to certain the ological conceptions, defused the theological problem of anthropomorphism in midrash by reframing "the terms of the discussion ... to view the anthropomorphic depiction of God as a problem not of belief but of representation, of the construction of divinity ... a case of the figurative use of language to express truth . . ." (99) S.Y. Friedman, writing before D. Halivni had proposed the existence of a pre-Savoraic school of anonymous Talmudic composers and redactors (the "Stammaim"), called attention to an integrative editorial project in which several sugyot in b.B.Qam. had been systematically</page><page sequence="41">[41] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 51 conflict between the general rule and the specific one without changing the nature of either source. The opposite is true of the later editors (see below). That the authors composed pseudepigraphically in Rava's and Abayye's names is, to be sure, an act of fraud but it is, nonetheless, a pious one. Pseude pigraphy implies passionate involvement with one's sources and traditions, climaxing in their internalization, and culminating in their ongoing recre ation : these anonymous rabbis have come to identify fully with their named ( Amoraic) predecessors. In the present context, the act of composing in the name of Rava and Abbaye affirms the Stammaitic perception of the vital role that those two played in the development of argumentation and the sugya!00 glossed in order to shift more of the elements in a damage claim from the category of קנס (fines, which could be assessed only by courts deriving from Eretz Israel) to that of ממון (direct mone tary compensation), so that they could be levied in the Diaspora ("הוספות וקטעי ,סברא' בפרק החובל [ב"ק פ"ח]פ"ח],"Tar&amp;iz40[1970/1g71]4t8-43)-The programmatic nature of that glossarial en terprise is suggestive of the editorial projects embarked upon by redactors such as ours (albeit, in the arena of exegesis). However, that approach may be distinctive, and the following issues re quire further investigation : those glosses had immediate and significant halakhic ramifications ; they had not been incorporated into all Talmudic textual witnesses (provisionally, cf. n. 119 be low on some suggested ways in which distinctions may be made between Stammaitic, Savoraic, and Geonic editorial expansions). (too) The renowned הויות דאביי ורבא ("discussions of Abbaye and Rava"), celebrated in the context of our sugya. (b.Suk. 28b, with parallel in b.B.Batra 134a and nowhere else in the Bavli!) seems to be more a presumed Talmudic (and ongoing post-Talmudic) literary recollection than a reconstruction of actual historical fact. Cf. Kalinin, op. cit.,"Friends and Colleagues, or Barely Acquainted?,"175-92; E.Wajsberg,"qov ';לעניין הקשר האישי בין אביי ובין רבא בר LeshonenuLeshonenu 58 (( 199459צ(95־• Kalmin explicates the motivation for this phrase: "most likely the discussions of Abaye and Rava are paired together . . . because Abaye and Rava are considered by whoever coined the term to be the most important rabbis of their generation, perhaps of the entire Amoraic period {idem., 192 ; cf. the following note)!' Should we privilege attributions to Rava and Abbaye in constructing the medium and the message of their Stammaitic spiritual descendants? Pseudepigraphic attribution to other mas ters has also occurred (cf. nn. 1 and 2 above). Halivni has suggested that anonymous statements may have been attributed to Rav Ashi because he has been credited with editing the Talmud (מקורות ומסורות ... בבא קמא)קמא, op.cit., 20, n. 22; S.Y. Friedman describes the opposite scenario to account for many similar situations: לכאן יש לשייך את התופעה הרגילה של מימרא הבאה בשם" ",אמורא במקום אחד ובסתם במקום אחר, מתוך שבעלי סתם התלמוד משתמשים במימרא זו בהקשר חדש תלמוד ערוך, פרק השוכר את האומנין, בבלי בבא מציעא פרק ששי... הפירושים [Jerusalem, 1990] 19• and cf. 18-21). Pseudepigraphic attribution to Abbaye and Rava sometimes seems to come in through the back door: היו מהדורות של הסוגיא בהן נכנס דיבור זה לאחר מימרת רבה. ומשנכנס דיבור" לאחר מימרת רבה היה מי שסבר שיש לנסח קושיא על רבה בשמו של אביי m" (idem., 387)• Such attri bution may be a by-product of scribal abbreviations and expansions (=,רב = רב, רבא, רבה; רבא רב אסיאסי cf. פרק האשה רבה, op. cit., 44°&gt;n-5&gt;435&gt;n-27'andrMab°ve)• Still the choice of Abbaye or Rava as speaker may be an indicator of the general significance of these names to the Stammaim. Friedman has called attention to the existence of anonymous passages that appear in Rava's name in some versions preserved in manuscript (פרק האשה רבה,</page><page sequence="42">52 JAY ROVNER [42] At the same time, the retrojection of contemporary hermeneutical problems onto Abbaye and Rava serves to confirm the authority of the anonymous group and to validate their program!01 Is it possible to project, on the basis of op.cit.,op.cit.,op.cit.,433), and further noted that,although other authorities are credited with such passages, that just does not occur with the same frequency (cf. n. 19). ( 101 ) Cf. S. Y. Friedman, פרק האשה רבה, op. cit., n. 4 above, having found in several passages "דיבורים של סתם התלמוד המופיעים במקצת הנוסחים בשם רבא"(p.433)'observed,"שינויים כאלה ישנם גם בשם אמוראים אחרים, אבל דומה שאינם באותה כמות"(n. 19 there; cf. ibid.,440 and n. 5). In an intriguing article ("Mishnaic Literary History and the History of a Mishnaic Idea: on the Formation of the Mishnah's Theory of Intention,With Special Reference to Tractate Maas erot"AJSReviewerot"AJSReview 2[1g86]135-55), M.Jaffee demonstrated how a dispute between the houses of Hillel and Shammai could have been pseudepigraphically created by Ushan authorities in order to ground their own opinions, including that of R.Judah, securely in the tradition of their (afore mentioned) illustrious predecessors. Then, in a second level attempt to strike even deeper roots, the Tosefta version of the same material has R.Judah himself explicitly attributing the views to Hillel ! Jaffee went on to suggest a historical contextualization beginning with the redaction of the Mishnah, where R.Judah,"a major Ushan authority is enlisted into the Hillelite camp during the period at which its champions are shaping, in their own image, the legal thought and histori cal picture of the emerging rabbinic: movement" (p. 153). The two levels of authorship of our sugya could correspond to the two levels of documentary pseudepigraphy suggested byjaffee. Aside from the material by Fischel cited above n.1 (and cf. the following n.),Rabbinics schol ars have not attempted to contextualize Talmudic pseudepigraphy as a phenomenon socially and historically, nor to account for the mentality of its practitioners. Observations in the follow ing material,which examines Biblical and inter-testamental sources,may be helpful in construct ing the nature of Talmudic pseudepigraphy. M. Smith,"Pseudepigraphy in the Israelite Literary Tradition"Tradition" Psmdepigrapha 1 (1971)191-227 summarizes the varieties of pseudepigraphy and sug gests a historical context. M. Fishbane, Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel (Oxford-New York, NY, 1985) 530-43, is most useful on techniques, motivation and mindset. J. Barton, Oracles of God:God: Perceptions of Ancient Prophecy in Israel After the Exile (Oxford-New York, NY, 1986) 62 f., has noted the importance, throughout the ancient world, of ascribing ideas to venerated ancestors in order to facilitate their acceptance. D. S. Russell, who treated The Method and Message of Jexuish Apocalyptic Apocalyptic Apocalyptic ( Philadelphia, PA, 1964), has summarized and revised his views in Divine Disclosure (London, 1992); cf. the treatment of the motivations and mindset in the latter work, pp. 64-69. The notion of pseudepigraphy can be useful both generally and specifically. Specifically, one could surmise that attribution to Abbaye and Rava could be relevant to the Stammaitic argu mentational program (cf. the preceding note), although it is likely that further research will dem onstrate that many other pseudepigraphic passages have been attributed, not all of them to those two Amoraim. The notion of pseudepigraphy could be of far reaching heuristic value in a general way, help ing to bridge the gap between the plain sense of their sources and the innovated constructions crafted at the instance of Stammaitic motivations and patterned according to their mindset. The notion that, e.g., prophetic sources may require reinterpreting in order for their truth to be properly understood, or that contemporary problems, whether of a socio-historical or a scholastic-textual nature, may be found to have been authoritatively addressed in such sources, certainly has its analogues in Stammaitic compositional methods and messages. Furthermore, Smith and Fishbane especially, make us aware that pseudepigraphy is immanent not only in extra-Scriptural works, but that it is manifest in the very composition and redaction</page><page sequence="43">[43] THE CASE OF SUKKA 28 53 the group description limned above, a functional image that correlates with a historical situation?102 Perhaps, at the very least, an institutional context could be inferred and hypothetically constructed.103For instance, the desire to integrate all traditions suggests a reaction to a shift from smaller, more parochial and diverse, academic settings to a more inclusive environment. It is not the collation of traditions, and critical reflection upon them perse that is significant, for those processes were certainly taking place throughout the Amoraic period,104 but rather the desire to correlate and integrate them into a unified whole that could reflect occurrences manifest on a socio-cultural level, e.g., a period of transition when the coalescence of several schools (or their remnants) under, or into, a more centralized system came to be reflected in the inclusively apologetic Stammaitic editorial program. 4.3. REVALUATION OF VALUERS The most recent set of authors reveals a fundamentally different outlook. A reverence both superficial and intense decrees that no tradition may be dis missed. However, pseudepigraphic writing is no longer appropriate because of Scripture itself. Finally, proponents of the idea that continuous Stammaitic composition overlapped the Amoraic period and is preserved in the argumentation of the Bavli, may find sug gestive N. P. Lemche's observation that prophetic composition persisted into the Second Temple period even beyond apocalyptic (albeit in separate schools, cf ."From Prophetism to Apocalyptic : fragments fragments of an Article,"/« the Last Days :onJewish and Christian Apocalypticand its Period,Jeppesen, K. Nielsen and B. Rosendal (eds.) [Aarhus C, Denmark, 1994] 98-103). (102) As M.Jaffee has observed,"exegetical ingenuity follows upon and legitimates funda mental innovations within the social order which have arisen independently of exegetical reflec tion . . . exegesis is often only an epiphenomenon of innovation"("Halakhah in Early Rabbinic Judaism : Innovation Beyond Exegesis, Tradition Before the Oral Torah" Innovation in Religious Traditions: Essays Traditions: Essays in the Interpretation of Religious Change [Berlin-New York, NY, 1992] 112 f.; cf. n.g2 above). (103) One's assumption regarding historicity may be a function of the genre in which ma terial is found. As P. Cox (op. cit., n.1 above) has demonstrated in the case of biographical narra fives in Late Antiquity, anecdotes reported therein may be more reliably understood as a reflec tion of the concerns and times of the biographer himself. Similarly cautionary conclusions were drawn by M.Jaffee who explored the historicity of halakhic traditions (reports on the origins of takkanot)takkanot) in early Rabbinic literature. His conclusions could be applied to the historicity of our Rava/Abbaye traditions in particular, and the overall sugya in general (cf. the previous n.),as well: "on the basis, at least, of the evidence of the early rabbinic literature, tannaitic legislation is not not recoverable as a series of events inJewish social and institutional history ( Jaffee's emphasis). Rather, like the biographical traditions about the Sages reported in the same literature, the Tannaitic TaqqanahTaqqanah is a source for the literary and intellectual history of those who created it as a literary form . . . Historians of rabbinic law and religion should reckon with them accordingly." (104) This can be seen as well in the efforts of late Amoraim,such as Rava, his colleagues, and his followers, to develop generalized principles, under which a variety of rules may be integrated, a movement from the specific and discrete toward the abstract. J. Rubenstein has traced one</page><page sequence="44">54 JAY ROVNER [44] passion for the past has been eclipsed by a preoccupation with the present. Where necessary, previous materials will be borrowed and transferred from one context to another, but this will always be in accordance with an agenda set by the contemporary need for order. This program is revolutionary. Although it is premature to describe it in any but tentative terms, it seems as if a new and coercive vision, all encom passing in focus, has swept into the academy. Fundamentally conservative in its exagerrated mission to rationalize all sources, this new movement recon figures those sources in accord with a grandiose revisionist project whose aim is to integrate them, not merely one at a time, but in entire groups. This is ap parent in Sukka,where four different sukka sources105are rationalized in con trast to a pair of sources on Yom Kippur (see below). This project may also be seen in b.Qidd. 34-35, where the hermeneutical dispute as to whether shew ketuvimketuvim ha-baim ke-'ehad melamdim or an melamdim was matched up with a cat alogue of traditions regarding the nature of the commandment of phylac teries to form two sets of coordinates on a grid in which all of the traditions on the feminine exemption from positive time-bound commandments are laid out and compared!06 It is also apparent in b.Nid. 31b-3 2b, the other sugya that borrowed the line cum attribution : אמר רבא : הלכתא נינהו ואסמכינהו רבנן אקראי. There the sugya undertakes a systematic dialectical integration of two kinds of of womens' flux and that of men."1' It would be a worthwhile exercise to inventory some of the innovations wrought by the secondary authors of b.Suk. 28 in order to appreciate the ex tent to which the neo-conservatism of this group wrought a revolutionary transvaluation of values. To begin with, they used the pretext of a lexical con flictflict (regarding the signification of האזרח) to realign Tannaitic midrashim. This is a clear departure from the practice established in sugyot where Amor aim, primarily Abbaye and Rava1,08 provide the solutions. In these sugyot, the such instance in "The Sukkah as a Temporary Dwelling : a Study in the Development of Talmu die Thought," HUCA 64(1993)137-66. (105) Asmakhta, hilkheta, a general exemption (from positive time-bound commandments), and two null midrashim (five if the fourth set is counted as two). (106) See nn. 118 and 119 below for other comparisons between Sukka and Qiddusinwilh the potential for further illuminating the nature of the late Stammaitic enterprise. (107) Little maybe said here, byway of comparison, concerning Amoraic sugyot,due to the lack of a core Amoraic sugya in these three sugyot, out of which context the Stammaitic ones developed. The material in Sukka is all borrowed, as is that in Qiddusin (except for a piece of exe gesis by Aha bar Yaakov). Still, in Niddah, aside from Yosef, Mar Zutra and Rava (also borrowed from other contexts), a tradition traced back to Sheshet at the very beginning of the sugya may have served as the pretext for the expansive Stammaitic exegetical inquiry that followed. (108) Sources are provided in the following note. Perhaps this is another indicator of the im portance of these Amoraim in the eyes of the Stammaitic authors of b.Suk. 28 (cf. n. 100 above).</page><page sequence="45">[451 the case of sukka 28 55 meaning of a word or phrase is challenged using the formula : למימרא ...משמע followed by a source that demonstrates a contrary signification (cf. B. 1 .a).The Amoraic respondents resolve such conflicts by confirming both usages (e.g., proposing differences of context).109 In our sugya, on the other hand, the chal lenge to the meaning of האזרח in a Tannaitic midrash (authenticated by a parallel in the Sifra)110resulted in its rejection! As a consequence, that exe getical teaching, which still had to be preserved in some form in the econ omy of traditions, was downgraded in status to the level of asmakhta.m Moreover, to solve the aforementioned conflict and to counteract the downgrading of the baraita, the redactors declared, on the basis of a line bor rowed from an entirely different context, in the name of Rabbah/Rava (at tribution borrowed from that context as well), that the feminine exemption from sukka was actually a matter of ancient tradition, a hilkheta}.12 The decla ration that a ruling is grounded in a hilkheta due to dialectical necessity, as a convenient logical inference, seems arrogantly preposterous: a hilkheta ought to be recovered from ancient tradition or, at the very least, inferred when the source of a traditional practice stretches back beyond recollection (cf. the many tefillin halakhot reported in Abbaye's name).113 To be sure, the feminine exemption from sukka is ancient. However, it had already been de rived by tradition from האזרח and subsumed under the general feminine ex emption from positive time-bound commandments, either of which provides (log) Sources for למימרא ...משמע sugyot are b.Ned. 30b and 35a, b.Git. 32a; b.Seb. 19b and b.Mak.b.Mak. 8a=b.cArak. 30b. The sugyot from Sebuot and Makkot also introduce the contradictory text with the term: ורמינהו/ורמינהי, ausage picked up in the version of the Oxford MS of our sugya. (110) Siffa Emor, Perek 17:g (fol. 103a). (111) Urbach, 83 ,ההלכה, noted this occurrence. On asmakhta (and the verbal expression, 150ג:,(אסמכינהו רבנן אקראי cf., 84 f.: M.Elon,המשפט העברי (Jerusalem, 1973) 256-60, which re lies on M. Guttmann, מפתח התלמוד (Budapest-Breslau, 1906-30) v. Ill, Appendix to Part One; Halivni, Peshat and Derash, 155 f. (112) Although the falsification may travel in opposite directions, composition by borrowing, as accomplished by the secondary authors, is an act of pseudepigraphy as well as is the creation of a teaching in order to project it onto a predecessor, as implemented by the primary creators of the sugya. However, they are fundamentally different as well, in way that may well have heuris tic implications for tracking the history and development of the Talmud. The earlier group is still on the inside of the Talmudic process. True, they stand outside of the traditions which they are observing and correlating; they are playing the game of manipulating sources in the com position of sugyot. Still, they are not only moving the pieces, they are also acting as the pieces (pseudepigraphically acting the roles of Abbaye and Rava in their own [Stammaitic] program). This continues the Amoraic practice of recasting traditions, retextualizing them as they are adapted to new situations or literary settings. The latest group has a much less integrated perspective, for they are completely outside of the game : they only move the pieces (textual transfer, transfer of blocs).

Appeal to a hilkheta in this case is artificial and ingenuous.114 The fact that it has become an acceptable strategy in Tal mudic dialectic requires explanation.115 This new generation of Stammaim is determinedly interventionalistic. Witness the aforementioned rejection and reduction of the Sukka baraita. Their handling of the Yom Kippur conflict is even more extreme. There ( B. 1 .a), despite the fact that they themselves had brought the midrash of האזרח in Lev r6:2g (including women in 'inui) to successfully refute that of Sukkot (Lev 23:42), in the end they revised the very substance of that baraita, i.e., they shifted the target of the inclusion, marginalizing it in the process. Thus, while women were still included in 'inui, albeit on the authority of an entirely unrelated verse (איש או אשה in B.2.a),116 Lev r6:2g was siderailed to follow (114) In superseding the positive time-bound exemption (affirmed for sukka in b.Qidd. 34 a-b) our sugya is irrelevant to codifiers. Typically commentators cite m.Suk. 2:8, not our sugya, as a source. Some may add that the underlying rationale is the above exemption (cf. Rabenu Manoah ad Maimonides, Hilkhot sukkah 6:1 ; Magen David (Taz) ad Shulhan Arukh Orah Hayyim 640, beginning. The latter was noted by Refael Shalem ha-Kohen, תפארת בחורים ad b.Suk. 28a, reprinted in אספת זקנים: קובץ מפרשים על מסכת סוכה (Tel-Aviv, 1974'unpaginated), who com mented that the Mishnah is in conflict with the sugya (and see references there). On contra dictory sugyot, cf. n. 90 above. (115) Cf. n. 39 above on hilkheta. M.Jaffee developed the idea that, out of the evolving rab binic (Tannaitic) self-perception, the understanding arose that their traditions are primordial ("Halakhah("Halakhah in Early Rabbinic Judaism,"cited in n.39). Viewing our sugya in the light ofjaffee's insight, it would seem that this sugya in a sense recreates something like Eliezer's recollection to the effect that an apparently new halakhah requiring that Ammon and Moab separate poor tithe in the Sabbatical year (m. Yad.4:3) is not an innovation at all; actually it is an ancient tradition going back to Sinai (op. cit., 121). In our situation, the editors seem to have discovered (through Rava / Rabbah) that sukka is a hilkheta ! However, times have changed and so have the perceptions of the rabbis. The "rediscovery"of this old sukka tradition was necessitated by an extremely ar bitrary decision as to the treatment of האזרח, an approach that would not have been taken in earlier (Amoraic) sugyot on similar problems (cf. n. 109 above). (116) The derivation of a ritual observance such as 'inui from איש או אשה (Num 5:6) is unique to the Bavli in Rabbinic literature, to its anonymous layers specifically. The Bavli reports three exegetical traditions that specify the obligation of women to Scrip tural prohibitions. Exod 21:1 (אשר תשים לפניהם) includes women in civil law (דינים, taken to mean דיני ממונות); Num 5:6 (איש או אשה אשר יעשו מכל חטאות האדם) includes them in negative prohi bidons punishable by lashes or karet (premature death ; the category, עונשים, is defined by Rashi ad ad b.Yeb. 84b); Exod 21:29 (וכי יגח שור] ...והמית איש או אשה]) is taken to imply the application to women of all aspects of crimes involving death (מיתות; see b.Qidd. 35a-b and b.B. Qam. 15a). Comparison with halakhic midrashim shows that these teachings, having originated in dis parate schools, have been reconfigured somewhat in the Bavli, both in their formulation and in the way that they have been understood, in order to correlate and distinguish them. For exam pie, examination of civil legislation in terms of halakhic midrashim yields the following result. The Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai (p. 158) reports that Rabbi Akiva teaches the inclusion</page><page sequence="47">[47] THE CASE OF SURKA 28 57 the abstruse track of tosefet 'inui, an admittedly brilliant, though virtually irrelevant, gambit. This generation's work seems ironically self-contradictory. They piously refuse to forgo a tradition, but have no problem adjusting those sources be yond recognition. The result is the subordination of all sources under their own unifying and compulsive gaze. Their artificial hermeneutical program imposes unity and system on a massive scale, institutionalizing what before had been a collection of disparate sources and groups of sources. Awesome in scope and in design (b.Qidd. 34-35) and brilliant in the details of its work ings (see previous paragraph), the products of the more recent layer of redac tion can seem so abstracted from the actual subject matter as to strike one as bizarre. of women in civil legislation (דינים) on the basis of Exod 21:1, while Rabbi Yishmael is reported to insist that women will be included throughout the Torah, in each pertinent legislative pas sage. On the other hand, midrashim attributed to R.Yishmael and his school locate the respon sibility of women for damages (נזקין) in Num 5:6 (Sifrei,Naso, section 2 [p. 5], cited also in Mek hilta, Nezikin, section 6 [p.269 and repeated in sections 7 and 9] ; cf. M.Chernick,"®,X in Halakic Midrashim," The JQR 58(1983] 260 f.). The two Tannai tic midrashic traditions are distinguished both in the terms used and the Scriptural sources selected. In the Bavli (B.2.a), עונשים has replaced נזקין as the subject of Num 5:6. עונשים has been used to connote capital punishment, cf. Mekhilta, Nezikin, section 5 [p. 2 66] and Sifrei Deuteronomy, Shoftim, section 190 [p. 231]). However, it also connotes civil law (cf. Mekhilta, Nezikin, section 11 [p. 288] ).Therefore, עונשים derived by the Bavli from Num 5:6 (instead of נזקים as in the Sifrei and Mekhilta passages cited above) and דינים (grounded in Exod 21:1 as attributed to R. Akiva in the Mekhilta de-Rashbi) could overlap. However, the Bavli chose to understand them as non congruent: עונשים indicates negative prohibitions punishable by lashes or כרת, while דינים cov ers civil legislation (as worked out in b.Qjdd. 35a-b and b.B. Qam. 15a; the usage may go back to Deut 17:8, where דינים, opposed both to דם [homicide] and to נגע [assault] as categories of דברי ריבות [matters of disputes], would by process of elimination comprise "civil or criminal law,"cf. J. H. Tigay, TheJPS Torah Commentary: Deuteronomy [Philadelphia, PA, 1996] 164). This distinction is already implicit in the exchange of R.Yishmael's נזקים for עונשים in the Bavli's version of the midrashic teaching (attributed in the Bavli to the school of Yishmael as well). The midrash preserved in the Sifrei (and mentioned several times in the Mekhilta), proba bly had glossed Number's איש או אשה כי יעשו מכל חטאות האדם") חטאות") as נזקים"" in order to distinguish it from the Tannaitic use of חטאות to denote the sacrifice of that name. In its con textual matrix in Scripture, חטאות referred to misappropriation of property, whether human or divine. Evidently considering the term out of context, the Bavli applied חטאות to the broad category of prohibitions punishable by lashes or karet — designated by עונשים, thereby remov ing from it civil legislation (to be covered by דינים, derived from Exod 21:1 ).This extended and innovative intention was immanent in the Bavli's revised formulation (עונשים instead of נזקין) even before it was set out clearly in the late, anonymous, dialectical exercise located in b.Qidd. 35a-b and b.B. Qam. 15a. The (anonymous) Bavli is also unique in that, following up on the replacement of נזקים by עונשים in Num 5:6, it locates there the obligation of women in religious prohibitions, viz., de sisting from admixtures of leavening (Pesah. 43a) and affliction on Yom Kippur (b.Suk. 28a) —</page><page sequence="48">58 JAY ROVNER [48] And herein lies the key to their en terprise.The most recent layer represents the efforts of a group of institutional functionaries who have inherited both Amoraic and Tannaitic traditions and, in addition, the efforts of previous scholars, both named and anonymous, to integrate those sources throughout the subject areas in which they were included. This culminating group, sur veying the state of integration achieved by their predecessors, finds itself in a position to correlate the previous work on a larger scale by achieving, i.e., imposing, with uncompromising dialectical thoroughness, a final, all encompassing, integration of all past sources and productions.117 Is it possible to situate this editorial policy historically or socially ? This would both punishable by karet, and substituting one sacrifice for another (b.Tem. 2b) — punishable by lashes). (117) The whole tenor of my text-dependent and source-bound description would seem to be in conflict those critics who infer the Talmud as a work encouraging "open-ended investiga don" ( Lightstone, op.cit., who acknowledges D.Kraemer, The Mind of the Talmud: an Intellectual His tory tory of the Bavli [New York, NY, 1990], for this characterization of Talmudic mentality). Perhaps we are describing two very different modalities of scholarship and of intellectual life. It is worth while to recall M. Carruthers' contrasting description of Aquinas' genius as opposed to that of Einstein (The Book of Memory: a Study of Memory in Medieval Culture [Cambridge, England-New York, NY, 1990) 2-4. Where the latter was praised for his great imagination, the former was cele brated for his prodigious memory. However, in the final analysis, Carruthers showed that it was possible to elicit similar evidence of genius from both descriptions, including great powers of concentration, single-minded pursuit of a problem, creativity in the working out of solutions, and the willingness to take risks and make mistakes. Similarly, here, one can look at the use of sources and describe the project in textual terms; but one can also admire the imagination shown in developing conceptual structures or the need for open-ended exploration in order to come up with the solution. Neither perspective exhausts the totality of the Talmudic product. Nonetheless, if historical verisimilitude is taken into account, I would suggest that the text-and source-centered description would more likely be the way in which the redactors themselves would have verbalized their conception of the nature of their work. To be sure, its predilection for dialectical forms of expression does constitute an issue criti cal to the construction of the Stammaitic agenda. While the appeal to a medium of inquiry and questioning (the aforementioned "open-ended inquiry") may undoubtedly be part of the mes sage, it is not constitutive of that message. The shift from apodictic rhetorical forms to discursive inquiry is characteristic of oral thinking as practiced under heavy cheirographic influence. Un doubtedly, another factor is based in the context of oral paideia, viz., the dialectical style origi nates in the attempt to exert control over thought by objectifying it in order to reflect upon it analytically as opposed to internalizing tradition by memorizing it uncritically : this was first made under the influence of the cultural context of public debate and argument. (cf.Jaffee, cited n.45 above; "Rhetorical Strategy,"«/).rit., 183f., n.8 above,and on 184, n.14). Attempts have been made to recover conceptual concerns underlying anonymous sugyot. Cf., e.g., B.Bokser,"Talmudic Studies," The State of Jewish Studies, S.J. D. Cohen and E.L.Greenstein(eds.) (Detroit Mi-New York, NY, 1990) too f.: a case of shifting religious conceptions; M. Kahana, "גילוי דעת ואונס בגיטין," TarbizTarbizTarbiz 52 (1992/1993)259 f.: conflicting halakhic positions, unmotivated by scholastic affecta tions; S.Y.

Moreover, it is difficult to know whether the projection of an authorial stance onto a social screen is a reflection of social reality or a manifestation of an imaginative fantasy never actually fulfilled.118 Nonetheless,were one to speculate upon the institutional image reflected in this group's work, the results would be grandiose. Just as they are in control of their tradition, so would these authors rule with unquestioned authority. For them,just like the integration of traditions and the imposition of control over sources, so is institutional control no longer only merely a passionate longing, but a fully realized operating assumption. (Alternatively, the infer ence elicited as a projection of their work is but a fantasy, never actualized by them in a historical setting.) Abstractedly distant from the very tradition that validates their hegemony, these new scholars are all the more empow ered because of the way in which they have enlisted the past to authenticate their programs. These are the scholastic conqistadors of Rabbinic Judaism, empire builders of the Talmudic way. They certainly represent themselves on the literary plane as far more innovative and interventive than the Sevoraim we have come to expect through sources such as Igeret Rav Sherira Gaon; (118) The notion that social turmoil motivated literary attempts to ensure social unity by preserving autonomy and empowering authority has been advanced in the case of early Geonic codification ( between 650 and 750, cf. N. Danzig מבוא לספר הלכות פסוקות, עם תשלום הלכות פסוקות [New[New York, NY-Jerusalem, 1993)1 f.,esp. n.10 on p. 2 f.). Similarly, Lightstone (op. cit., n.1 above, pp. 2 72-81 ),noting that persecution as a causative factor is difficult to prove, has suggested that social turmoil in late Sassanian Babylonia (500-650), arising from wars, revolutions and the dis empowering of minority populations through the Sassanian policy of centralizing government under their own control, may have spurred the Rabbis to undertake projects that would ensure their own autonomy (p.273). He proposes that the production of theTalmud as an autonomous literary creation modeling the Rabbinic scholastic ideal, and the establishment of centralized academies for the training of professional Rabbis, are mutually homologous means of respond ing to the crisis of the times. This hypothesis certainly fits the time-frame of the Savoraic period. However, several questions remain outstanding: the nature of the Talmud as an autonomous and complete work requires further clarification (cf. the following two notes, and cf. esp. the pre ceding note). Moreover,even granting a late dating for the establishment of academies, the fact remains that Rabbinic instruction still did take place in the Amoraic period, the Rabbis concep tion of their knowledge and position was formidable even then, and Rabbis functioned in var ious governmental and judicial functions during that period. Cf. R. Kalmin's review of Light stone,stone, ]AOS 116.3(1966)558-59. Finally, a trajectory for the evolution of the Bavli based upon internal motivating factors has been sketched, e.g., n. 45 and p. 48 above. It presumes a period of multiple, independent, oral textualizations (Amoraim), then a period of consolidation of teachings ( late Amoraim) and aeon sequent need to control them through classification and differentiation (first level Stammaim), followed by renewed treatment of that corpus (second level Stammaim). Textualizations of the stammaitic creations represent the Talmud as we know it.</page><page sequence="50">60 JAY ROVNER [50] they would be the pre-Geonic rabbis119 in whose time authority and control had been firmly vested in one or more centralized Talmudic academies.120 One more item might give us some pause, i.e., the possible rarity of these (119) It's difficult to fix the exact period of composition and the identity of the authors of b.Suk.b.Suk. 28. In light of a two-source theory of Talmudic redaction (cf. n.45 above), a pseudepi graphic sugya such as b.Suk. 28a-b, seems clearly to belong to the ( post-Amoraic) second-stage, that of the Savoraim. However, if we attribute the layer of anonymous argumentation to the Stammaim (using Halivni's term to designate a [largely] post-Amoraic group that precedes the Savoraim), then this sugya would come from that group. Even without distinguishing Stammaim from Savoraim, the sugya would seem to derive from the first part of the post-Amoraic period because it is a full-blown composition in a dialectical style. In this way it is distinguished from much of the material usually attributed to the Savoraim, viz., glosses, even those formulated in a dialectical style. Such components pre-suppose the existence of the sugya, which they are de signed to augment. On Savoraic explanatory and dialectical glosses cf. B.M.Lewin,"רבנן סבוראי ותלמודם,"(Jerusalem,1g37);j.Speigel,הוספות מאוחרות (סבוראיות) בתלמוד הבבלי (Ph.D.diss.,Tel Aviv University, 1975). On differences between Amoraic and Savoraic literature, cf., e.g., A.Co hen,"[ביקורת הלכתית לעומת ביקורת ספרותית בסוגיות התלמוד [פרק בהתהוות השכבתית של הבבלי" 4«1/0ספר יעקב לסלוי ",לבעיית זיהויים של קטעים סבוראיים [ב]בבלי"^46,31־331(1989)3ז (Tel-Aviv, 1986)83-96; M.S.Feidbium,""משנה יתירה': סידור המשנה באספקלריה של החומר הסתמי שבתלמוד" Rabbi Rabbi Joseph H. Lookstein Memorial Volume ( New York, NY, 1980) 7-15. Medieval sources have sown confusion concerning the authorship of some of this glossarial material : cf., e.g., the four sources collected in אוצר הגאונים, כרך תשיעי, מסכת קידושין, B. M. Lewin (ed.)( Jerusalem, 194°) 2, which vary between Savoraic and Geonic attributions. Medievals some times labeled early Geonim,Savoraim,or they attributed Savoraic interpolations to the Geonim who taught those versions. Although it has been claimed that conflicting attributions to Geo nim may be discounted (cf. Spiegel, ibid., 3 n.6; E. R. Zaini, "רבנן סבוראי והכרעותיה ם," Sinai 101 [1987/19881193-219; N. Danzig, מבוא, op. cit., 33L), a meaningful distinction may be drawn be tween early Geonic and Savoraic augmentation of the Talmud : Geonic additions have not been incorporated into the text to the same extent as Savoraic amplifications because, while the Sa voraim saw themselves as participants in the finalizing of the Talmud, the Talmud was a closed composition even in the eyes of its early Geonic glossators (cf. "לבעיית זיהויים של קטעים סבוראיים ב]בבלי],"cited above; "רבנן סבוראי,"Sinai 111[1992/1993]18491־)• If dated to early in post-Amoraic times, a degree of uncertainty remains regarding the time frame of the sugya, for whereas, e.g., Halivni, assigns Stammaitic argumentation to the fifth cen tury, Sherira Gaon has ascribed certain elaborate sugyot,e.g., b.Qidd. 2a-3b, to sixth century Savoraim (cf. אגרת רב שרירא גאון, B. M. Lewin [éd.] repr. Jerusalem, 1972] 71). Moreover, many other sugyot have been assigned to the Savoraim (cf. Spiegel, ibid., chapter three : "סוגיות סבוראיות 86-151 ",וסוגיות סתמיות ; J. E. Ephrathi, תקופת הגאונים וספרותה, [Petach-Tikva, 1973]סרגירת 'זה"' 159-273 ",הכלל לאתויי מאי')• Out sugya and the group it is being compared with (b.Qidd.34-35 and A.Mci.31 b-32b),do share terminology that has been identified as, generally, Savoraic: cf., e.g., the dialectical, formulaic structure: סלקא דעתך אמינא ...קמשמע לן, appearing throughout this sugya, which has been identified as Savoraic (cf.n.58 above), and the צריכא/צריכי segments in Qiddusin and Nuldah and identified as Savoraic in A. Cohen,cited above, Asufot 3( 1989)342 f., and n. 55 there. Perhaps, as a result of intensive stylistic comparison, distinctive literary forms, rhetorical modes, and intellectual programs could be identified and sorted diachronically. ( 120) It is possible that the latter group corresponds to the compilers of the Bavli function ing as the consolidators and empowerers of the literary tradition and, on a socio-political level,</page><page sequence="51">[51] THE CASE OF SU KKA 28 61 sugyot and, if that is the case, the reasons for it. Perhaps the literary record reflecting this program was not applied universally throughout the Talmud; the results may not have been widely preserved. If that is the case, the prod uct of the first level Stammaim and their sources predominates in the Talmud as we know it. 4.4. METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGE Both to better characterize the later layer of editorial work and to distinguish between the layers created and deposited by different groups, the intensive analysis of formulations121 and borrowings122 along both synchronic and dia chronic lines must continue. However, it is also necessary to integrate those observations into the controlling context of the perspective of each overall sugya; to compare sugyot with the aim of identifying like processes and even of sorting out diachronic distinctions. One way to accomplish this would be to seize upon the beginning already made in comparing and contrasting sugyot like b.Suk. 28 and b.Qidd. 34-35. More sugyot should be compared with b.Suk. 28 and b.Qidd. 34-35 to see if the hypothesized diachronic differences continue to hold, and if not, to iden tifytify others that will. Without the unifying vision afforded by this perspective, the significance of those usages, and their application and relevance to the history and development of the Talmudic text remains unintegrated and episodic. The two major approaches in Talmudic textual research need to commu nicate more effectively with one another. The philologists insist that texts have of the academy, as J. N. Lightstone (The Redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, its Social Meaning and Context Context [Waterloo, Ontario, 1994]) has proposed. However, the distinction between these two layers did not show up in Lightstone's analysis. So if there is any validity to our tentative findings, then the writing of such a social history is premature. (121) A word of methodological caution: the formulations must be studied carefully and in their dialectical contexts. A.Cohen has shown how terminological shifts may mark distinct au thorial layers. However, even the same terminology, examined in context, may be used to dis tinguish layers and interests (pace Cohen, רבנן סבוראי, op. cit., 186 f.). Cf. the analysis of למימרא דמשמעדמשמע ... sugyot in § 4 3 above, and see the following note. (122) The investigation and comparison of borrowings may produce important results. The fact that: ... אמר רבא הלכתא נינהו ואסמכינהו, was borrowed proved crucial to understand ing the meaning and development of our sugya (cf. § 2.1 above). True, there are several sugyot that use this clause, but only three include the attribution as well. The isolation of the original usage is important, for that occurrence was identical in function with the anonymous instances, and came from the same authorial layer of the Talmud. It is only in the two attributed borrow ings that come from this late Stammaitic layer that the usage is different (cf. above nn.39 and 61 above on הלכתא). Therefore, meaningful research in the history of the sugya depends not only upon the identification of concordantly identical forms, but also on the recovery of dia chronic distinctions among such identical forms (cf. nn. 48, and 80, and the preceding note).</page><page sequence="52">62 JAY ROVNER [52] depths which may be plumbed to recover layers of meaning; the revisionists insist that the Talmud has been so thoroughly redacted that it is impossible to recover previous layers of meaning. In my opinion, the revisionist program is disingenuously blind to indications of tradental integrity: the fact that a statement does not encapsulate the very words of the attributee or that some attributions are pseudepigraphic does not mean that,once formulated, such traditions were not transmitted faithfully. On the other hand, the philologists tend to feel that the research is complete with the demonstration of textual dependency: who borrowed from whom, or which is original and which an interpolation. The interests of both groups could converge if those observa tions of textual dependency would be correlated and analysed, so that dia chronically distinguished conceptual and stylistic patterns could be identi fied and described as a preliminary stage in writing the intellectual and stylistic history of the Bavli and its sponsors. Several individuals have discussed issues treated in this study with me, either at great length or in the briefest of exchanges; these conversations opened my eyes to solutions, possibilities and points-of-view that had not occurred to me thinking alone. Others, in reading and reacting to portions of this study, have provided invaluable feedback. I would like to thank my teachers Shamma Y. Friedman and Yaakov Sussman, and Eliezer Diamond, Judith Hauptman, Martin Jaffee, Richard Kalmin, and Jeff Rubenstein. I accept re sponsibility for the interpretation and application of those interchanges in the present study. This article developed out of research supported by a grant from the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture, for which I am grateful.</page></plain_text>
