He generally features prominently in treatments of Cynics of the Roman period, but scholars are more often than not reluctant to include him within their ranks.1 Two recent studies continue the ambiguity: Klaus Dôring refers to Lucian as a satirist, but employs him only for his depictions of identifiable Cynics.2 William Desmond, on the other hand, lists Lucian himself among the second century Cynics, hesitantly describing him as a literary Cynic and a 'cynical critic of mankind': '... he is a Cynic in his adulation of a Diogenes or Menippus, and cynical in his self-assured contempt for his ignoble contemporaries'.3 Desmond's attribution to Lucian of Cynicism with and without a capital is historically tenuous, as is the implied opposition between his adulation of some Cynics and his critical endeavour towards other people/Cynics. But the notion of literary Cynicism, which scholars have long since associated with Bion, Menippus and Cercidas, may prove useful in the search for a more satisfactory solution to the issue, namely to focus less on the doctrinal allegiance of the author and more on the diversity within the movement we wish to relate him to.4 There are good reasons for the continued uncertainty regarding Lucian's Cynic status. Most prominent perhaps is his Protean authorial persona. Philosophy is a favourite satiric theme in the corpus, but the author's various protagonists and narrators - even where he seemingly speaks in his own voice - hold a variety of views, among others, Cynic, Epicurean and Sceptic. The shifting stance and absence of philosophical commitment disallow easy equation of philosophical allusions and ideas with the convictions of the historical figure.5 Linked to the author's lack of commitment is the apparent superficiality of his use of and reference to philosophy which are, in the view of Judith Hall, limited to 'the sort of things that anyone who has dozed his way through a course of philosophy lectures at some time is likely to remember'.6 Scholars have attributed 1 Notably in D.R.

BOSMAN this to the author's subordination of philosophical views firstly to his arsenal of traditional topoi and secondly to his literary, rhetorical, performative and humor ous aims.7 Observing Lucian's contentment to represent the various schools by means of (often repeated) caricatures and commonplaces, Hall ascribes the result ing eclectic mix to the satisfaction of immediate contextual requirements.8 In the wake of Branham's seminal work on Lucian's 'rhetoric of laughter', a significant section of current Lucianic studies tends to regard all philosophical allusions as ludic constructs subject to the author's comic poetics.9 A further ambiguity in his relationship with Cynicism concerns his fluctuating sentiments towards its exponents, dishing out both praise and blame. In the two treatises on contemporary Cynics Peregrinus and Demonax, the former is depicted as a melodramatic charlatan, the latter judged 'the best of all philosophers'.10 An unkind stereotype of the Cynic occurs in the Philosophies for Sale and disparag ing depictions are found in the Runaways and the Symposium. Most other Cynic and Cynic-like figures, however, play favourable or sympathetic roles, including Diogenes, Crates and Menippus, Anacharsis, Parrhesiades, the cobbler Micyllus and the god Momus. An earlier generation of scholars sought to solve the variance by means of historical reconstruction based on a postulated chronological arrangement of Lucian's output.11 Bernays, for example, proposes an initial positive appraisal of the philosophy which in later works turned into mutual hostility between Lucian and his Cynic contemporaries.12 However, owing to a lack of evidence, theories based on the chronological development in Lucian's thought have struggled to find acceptance.13 The current stress on Lucian's literary strategies is no doubt necessary. The author's elusive self-positioning is crucial to the lasting attraction and fascination his work exerts, and any attempt to suppress it or to put him in a doctrinal strait jacket would be futile. His preferred literary forms are evidently chosen for their ability to entertain and not to convey doctrine; extracting theoretical philosophy 7 Caster (η. 5), 65-87 and J. Bompaire, Lucien écrivain: imitation et création (Paris, 1958), 182-5 both emphasize Lucian's indebtedness to preceding literary tradition as outweighing any personal sentiments regarding philosophy. 8 Hall (n. 5), 165-93, who does seem to overcompensate for factors inhibiting the performer eager to entertain and retain his audiences; her arguments regarding 'unwritten dictates of good taste' and '[considerations of tact and prudence', cf. 206-7, are difficult to reconcile with her agreement at 439 n. 11 with M.D. Macleod, 'Lucian's activities as a Μ1ΣΑΛΑΖΩ1Ψ, Philologus 123 (1979), 326 that Lucian's absence from contemporary sources may be due to 'his capacity for making enemies'.

On the other hand, the Protean aspect of his satire should not be exaggerated to the point where all serious intent is seen to be subverted, deliberately contradicted and finally meaningless.14 He is evidently not a rigid school philosopher (these are exactly the butt of his humour), but his philosophical works are not markedly self-contradictory; it should even be possible to find them supported by a fairly consistent set of critical principles related to con temporary polemics but only loosely connected to any particular theoretical system. There are good reasons to think that Lucian found in Cynic tradition the 'stance from which to show up the current state of philosophy'.15 Certainly, the prevalence of specifically Cynic figures and the recurrence of Cynic themes and motifs in the corpus are out of proportion to the stature and influence that the school is usually allowed. Nesselrath's survey has shown Cynic motifs to occur more often, more consistently and over a wider part of his œuvre than the two contending systems of Epicureanism and Scepticism.16 Added to these are intricate and oblique Cynic imagery and disembodied voices within the corpus.17 Literary caricatures and critique against charlatan figures of the sect are not compelling evidence for view ing him as a hostile outsider. On the contrary, his association with the Cynics is long-standing, as is testified by the fact that the treatise The Cynic was attributed to him, mistakenly or not. Even the generally breezy philosophical engagements in the corpus do not necessarily reflect a superficial grasp of the positions involved. Many allusions to contemporary philosophical issues appear to be deceptively simple, masking a decent range of polemical topics.18 Again, this feature invites comparison with the Cynics, who traditionally were reluctant to formulate theory above a rudimentary level, but excelled at pointing out erroneous conceptions held by others. This ability rules out the oft-repeated but misguided conclusion that the rough Cynic figure was ignorant and even inherently incapable of coherent thought.19 Still, like Lucian, their real impact lay elsewhere: apart from transmitting the legendary embodiments and performances of wisdom of their founders in pithy format, the Cynics could lay claim to a distinct rhetoric and imaginative use of literary forms.20 14 Cf.

Grôsslein, Untersuchungen zum Jupiter Confutatus (Frankfurt a.M., 1998) reveals the remarkable skill and variety with which Lucian alludes to contemporary controversies. While Grôsslein's approach obscures Lucian's light satiric touch, T. Whitmarsh's review, CR 49.2 (1999), 374-5 is overly dismissive. 19 Cf. A.A.

Cynic influence on Lucianic rhetoric is evident throughout Branham (n. 9).</page><page sequence="4">788 PHILIP R. BOSMAN Lucian's affinities with Cynic tradition no doubt extended beyond philosophical content and it is this area which should receive due emphasis if we wish to cir cumscribe his relationship with the movement any further. The way forward seems to lie in proposing ways to reconcile Lucian's literary aims with his predilection for the Cynic tradition. It also seems important to relate Lucian not primarily to the legendary, idealised and ultimately bygone Cynic-as-moral-ejcemp/M/n we know from the anecdote tradition, but rather to the Cynic-as-critic closer to and contemporaneous with himself. The issue may be further clarified by considering the Zevs ΐλΐγχόμ€νος (Zeus Refuted). In this mini-dialogue, the supreme Olympian god is cross-examined by an impertinent and obstinate character named Κυνίσκος, or 'Puppy'. Cyniscus is obviously meant to be regarded a Cynic.21 The dialogue revolves around contradic tions in and the consequences of determinism, the same topic dealt with in another Lucianic dialogue, the Zeus Rants. In the latter work, however, the gods eavesdrop on a conversation between a Stoic and an Epicurean, the latter carrying the same banner as Cyniscus. This raises the question as to why Lucian chooses a Cynic to treat the topic in the Zeus Refuted and whether there is something specifically Cynic in the way it is treated. The dialogue starts abruptly: no setting is provided and no character intro duced.22 Cyniscus approaches Zeus to answer one simple question (τινα ού χαλίπήν ίρωτησιν, 1.9) which soon opens a whole can of worms on how the gods relate to fate. Lucian's human interrogator, under the pretence of ignorance, remains in relentless control of the conversation up to the final απορία, reducing the god to rhetorically inept defensive strategies. Apart from facile warnings and accusations, Zeus adds little more to the dialogue than providing keys to further arguments exposing the debilitating consequences of determinism on traditional belief and morality and, recursively, on determinism itself.23 Answering Cyniscus' initial question, Zeus affirms the authority of the poets Homer and Hesiod when they say that the Fates control everything - even, he admits, the gods themselves.24 Whenever Homer contradicts himself on the issue, he is not speaking under the inspiration of the Muses (2.6-14; 4.1-4). Cyniscus then pushes on to question the need for sacrifice and prayer when the gods are 21 Cyniscus also features in the Downward Journey, where his Cynic credentials are clearly indicated: Catapl. 7; cf. Grôsslein (η. 18), 3-4. 22 Helm (η. 16), 117-19 argues that the Zeus Refuted fits into the prayer wells scene of the Icaromenippus, both dialogues being filched from an original Menippean satire. His hypothesis on Lucian's use of Menippus has, however, been thoroughly discredited; cf. B.P. McCarthy, 'Lucian and Menippus', YCIS 4 (1934), 3-55; Hall (n. 5), 64-150. The Zeus Refuted stands well on its own and seems rather to be an instance of Lucianic recycling; cf. G. Anderson, Lucian: Theme and Variation in the Second Sophistic (Leiden, 1976), 11; 164. The scene's intended setting may be the divine abode, although Zeus is the one finally departing. In the Downward Journey Cyniscus is on his way to the Underworld. Abrupt starts are a regular Lucianic tech nique; cf. Anach.; Dial. mar. 4; Dial. D. 2.15; Dial. mort. 7.3, 18; Dial, meret. 7.8.11.3; cf. Helm (n. 16), 117; Hall (n. 5), 134; Grôsslein (η. 18), 5-8. 231. Bruns, Vortrdge und Aufsdtze (Munich, 1905), 261-2. 24 The following brief summary deliberately resists abstracting arguments from the lively inter action. Grôsslein (η. 18), 31-2 treats the various arguments each on its own, the main part revolving around three philosophical problems stemming from determinism: on the validity of statements about the future, the theological problem regarding prediction, and the moral conse quences of fatalism (free will, accountability and the futility of punishment).</page><page sequence="5">LUCIAN AMONG THE CYNICS 789 unable to change the course of things (5.2-13).25 Zeus prefers not to answer, instead accusing Cyniscus of allying with the sophists (καταράτων σοφιστών; 6.2) who conspire to strip the gods of their influence among humans.26 Cyniscus denies that he has anything to do with the sophists27 and repeats his question, warning Zeus not to provide feeble arguments again (και όπως άσφαλεστερον άποκρινή·, 6.15-16). Zeus now provides an alternative justification for sacrifice: acknowledgment of the gods' superiority (τιμώντες άλλως το βελτιον, 7.10—11),28 which Cyniscus rejects - once a slave to the Fates, immortality only worsens your plight (7.19-24). Oh no, says Zeus, the gods are eternally happy (8.1-3). But at this stage Cyniscus is on a roll: not all that happy, just look at poor Hephaestus and Prometheus and even Cronus. Also, the gods are frequently robbed, sometimes turning them into paupers in the twinkling of an eye. Even worse: they may be melted down if they are of gold or silver. Naturally, he adds, all these events can only be ordained by Destiny (8.4-22). Zeus resorts to threats: 'Careful, Cyniscus, what you say is slanderous; you'll soon be sorry!' (9.1-2). But Cyniscus remains defiant: 'Spare your threats, Zeus: you know that nothing can happen to me if Fate hasn't decided upon it for you. I see that not even temple robbers get punished, most of them get away; I suppose they were not destined to get caught' (ου γαρ εΐμαρτο, οΐμαι, άλώναι αυτούς', 9.3—7). On the ascendancy, Cyniscus softens up his opponent: Doesn't it follow that the gods are mere servants, tools in the hands of Fate (11.3-6)? And the Fates themselves? Surely, even they are subject to Destiny (είμαρμεvrj) and bound to their own decrees (11.12-24). Zeus counters feebly by suggesting yet another reason why the gods should be honoured: because they can foretell the future (12.3-6). Cyniscus, however, sees no sense in knowing the future if one cannot take any precautions against it, even on the rare occasion when the recipient of the oracle manages to unravel the usual obscurity and ambiguity (12.7-14.13). In a final bout he confronts Zeus with the issues of injustice and free will: honest people suffer in poverty while the wicked thrive: how can all that be destined (15.8-17.5)? Even if punishment awaits the wicked in the afterlife, would that be fair if they only acted out what was destined for them to do? Destiny is the one that should be punished, not Sisyphus and Tantalus (18.4-34). The poor supreme god, against the ropes, refuses to respond. But the pestilent interrogator will not let go without a final probing jab, this time subverting the very possibility of the Fates themselves: he still wanted to ask where they are located and how they manage to hold so many strings. Their destiny does not seem much better than anyone else's. But, 25 Questioning sacrificial practices has for Lucian an especially Epicurean flavour, Icar. 32; lupp. trag. 18; Bis acc. 2.88, but it is of course equally Cynic; cf. Grôsslein (η. 18), 34. 26 Bruns (η. 23), 260 links these 'sophists' to Epicureans, especially known for criticising Stoic theology; Grôsslein (η. 18), 11 η. 58; cf. also Grôsslein (η. 18), 36 η. 151, 37 who thinks of exponents of the Second Sophistic as advancing an Epicurean view. Their fifth-century equiva lents, like Protagoras and Aristophanes' Socrates, were similarly associated with undermining the gods. Both the argument against the gods' blissful state in 8.4-22 and the dialogue's setting in suspended time warn against precise identification; Zeus may simply resort to the term as conveniently abusive towards dangerous erudition; cf. Iupp. trag. 30.6. 27 Despite the denial, Cyniscus does not dissociate from their line of thought; cf. 7.14; 9.10— 11.1. 28 Lucian associates the Epicureans with mocking the gods' concern for sacrifices, cf. Iupp. trag. 18; Icar. 32; Bis acc. 2.8.3; all schools since Socrates were against the idea of manipulat ing the gods, seen as originating with the poets, cf. Grôsslein (η. 18), 32-9.</page><page sequence="6">790 PHILIP R. BOSMAN he concludes, Zeus' responses sufficiently clarified his thoughts on Destiny and Providence, the rest was not 'destined' for him to hear anyway (19.15-19). The dialogue's purport requires careful formulation, since a number of issues need to be kept in balance. Apart from its obvious - and overriding - entertainment value, the initial impression of mocking popular religion gives way to criticism of Stoic determinism. But, as Bruns has already noted, the depicted Zeus is not the Stoic supreme god identical to Destiny.29 This Zeus is rather the Homeric, literary figure who remains sharply distinguished from the μοίραι, nowhere uses the abstract terms ΐΐμαρμίνη and τυχή himself and twice prohibits Cyniscus from raising questions about them (3.7, 10.6-7).30 This Zeus's main concern is to protect the honours bestowed upon the gods; his main fear is that the perceptions cre ated by sophistic arguments would result in the loss of divine privileges.31 In the process, he makes the strategic error of opting for a Stoic interpretation of Homer and Hesiod. Lucian is fond of grouping Stoicism and the Olympian gods on the same side. In the Zeus Rants, the Stoic character Timocles champions the cause of the gods; here Zeus defends their doctrine of determinism and has to stand trial on behalf of Destiny and Providence.32 But defending the doctrine lands him in an even worse conundrum than losing honour and privileges: he ends up without sovereignty and without a basis for either morality or the gods' function to praise and blame. In a sense, then, Lucian satirizes both the dominant philosophy of his time and the great literary past of his Greek audience. A laugh at the expense of common religious folk may not be completely absent, but Lucian's audience was probably well acquainted with the incongruities stemming from Homer's anthropomorphic gods. His parody exploits these logical discrepancies, in particular the fact that the literature in which they feature was adopted as authoritative by the most reputable philosophical school.33 Retaining the Homeric Zeus, he proceeds to target Stoic compromises with traditional conceptions of the gods, in particular the glaring contradictions arising from their notions on Providence and Fate, about which Zeus pretends to be in the know.34 Constrained by genre and context, but wish ing to display as much variety in his critical arsenal as possible, Lucian breezes over quite a number of the complex issues inherent in the debate. In the process he does not hesitate to present a caricature of Stoic thinking: unfair perhaps, but within the bounds of the satirist's art; perhaps superficial, but enough to touch the nerves of the real Stoic conundrum which could - ironically - only be covered over by means of sophistries. There is nothing peculiarly Cynic about the philosophical arguments Lucian puts in the mouth of Cyniscus: they were current against the Stoics from any of the other philosophical schools - Academics, Peripatetics, Epicureans and Cynics.35 29 E.g. SVF 2.937, 968; cf. Bruns (η. 23), 253; Grôsslein (η. 18), 25 η. 117. 30 Πρόνοια also belongs to these, only used once by Zeus, 9.9. 31 Regarding 8.4-22, Caster (n. 5), 162 notes that the criticism is directed less against the Stoics than against the gods of the myths, Homer and popular religion. 32 Grôsslein (η. 18), 71 notes that from Iupp. conf. 15 onwards, Cyniscus attacks the Stoic doctrine directly with no distinction being made any more between Zeus and the abstract notions. 33 Chrysippus in particular was known and criticized for relying on Homeric authority; cf. Plut. Stoic, rep. 1056b6; Diogenianus in Euseb. Praep. evang. 6.216c. 34 The theologically destructive consequences of fatalism were well known since Carneades; cf. Cic. Nat. D. 3; Div. 3; Alex. Aphr. De fato 20. 35 Bruns (η. 23), 252; Grôsslein (η. 18), 91.</page><page sequence="7">LUCIAN AMONG THE CYNICS 791 Many have an Epicurean feel, but not exclusively so. Cyniscus also counters the view of the gods' blissful state: while the latter would have been shared by anyone believing in the gods' immortal happiness and Cyniscus again ridicules traditional myth rather than philosophical conceptions, he is certainly not on Epicurean ground when doing so.36 On the other hand, no argument advanced by Cyniscus clashes with Cynic thinking, while the issues raised fall within the ambit of their critique.37 Criticism of traditional religion, in particular divination and oracles, seems to have been regarded as Cynic terrain.38 Cynics rejected the possibility of predicting the future - an area where the Stoics diverted most dramatically from their Cynic roots and where the Cynics attacked when under threat of being engulfed by their own offspring.39 Stoicism saw history as a fixed chain of events and advocated acceptance of fate. Diogenes, on the other hand, preached radical freedom and claimed that he would confront fate with courage.40 Where the autonomy of voli tion is recognized, the future cannot be known. An amusing anecdote from one of the pseudo-Diogenic letters illustrates their rejection of determinism: while at the games, Diogenes encounters a diviner surrounded by a crowd. 'Are you a good diviner?' he asks. Ί am', comes the reply. 'Then tell me: am I going to strike you now with my staff or not?' 'You are not!' Diogenes strikes him and the crowd roars. 'What are you shouting about? He clearly is a bad prophet, and got beaten.'41 Lucian's choice of a Cynic voice to take on the supreme god was thus influ enced, at least in part, by Cynic interest. This is clear from the second-century Cynic Oenomaus' Charlatans Exposed (Γοήτων φωρα), extensive fragments of which were transmitted in Eusebius' Praeparatio evangelica and one of a precious few Cynic texts from the era. The overlap between the Charlatans Exposed and the Zeus Refuted is too great to be a coincidence and Lucian might even have been familiar with Oenomaus' work.42 The invective, considered one of the liveliest pieces of literature surviving from the second century,43 is directed predominantly at Apollo himself.

Hall (n. 5), 209-10, 503 n. 36, not excluding the possibility that Lucian knew Oenomaus, sees a closer resemblance between Oenomaus and the Alexander, but does not appreciate Oenomaus' true target as Stoic determinism.

BOSMAN forward abusive language against the god, who is called, among other things, 'most accursed, most shameless prophet' (ώ μιαρώτατ€ και άναισχυντότατΐ μάντι, 2.34) and, sarcastically, 'wonderful oracle-monger' (θαυμάσιος χρησμωδός; 2.67) who is either ignorant or malicious (3.29) with less integrity than the soothsayers, the quacks and the sophists (10.96—δ).44 The Eusebian fragments may be organized into three parts.45 In the main part, Oenomaus satirizes a number of well-known Delphic oracles from Greek litera ture, which he shows to be either too vague or too ambiguous to be of any use. Others are without moral foundation or consist simply of advice - and feeble advice at that - rather than based on real knowledge of the future. In a second part Oenomaus relates his personal experiences with the Clarian Apollo. He tells of his enthusiasm after receiving an obscure oracle from the god, only to hear that a certain businessman from Pontus got the exact same wording, which the latter interpreted as advice for solving his financial troubles. On further enquiry, Oenomaus received another two nonsensical answers, after which he bade the god to go hang himself and take his unintelligible verses with him (5.23^1). In the final section, Oenomaus turns to the philosophical problems underlying determinism. He attributes the doctrine to Democritus and Chrysippus, respectively the enslaver and half-enslaver of humanity, and accuses both of robbing humankind of what the Cynics consider its most precious possession: free will (της ημετέρας ζωης ή εξουσία, ην ημείς μεν αυτοκράτορα των αναγκαιοτάτων τιθέμεθα, 14.13-15). The so-called fixed chain of events (ΐίρμός) is constantly interrupted by the deci sions of humans and therefore can never be predicted (14.180-96). Like those of Cyniscus, Oenomaus' criticisms are not peculiarly Cynic. Only when turning to the issue of volition in the third section does he appear to speak from Cynic theory.46 Quite distinct, however, is the form of his satiric invective, in which he directly accuses the god, who is depicted as a bungling fool trying to cover up his ignorance.47 This has no equivalent in ancient literature apart from Lucian's dialogues and would have been the reason for the negative estimate of Oenomaus by the emperor Julian, in whose eyes he scorns all things divine and human.48 Despite Julian's attempt to salvage Cynicism from its shameless side, 44 Cf. Hammerstaedt (η. 39), 67-8; the abusive terms are ambiguous, as Oenomaus' view entails that the oracles do not really derive from a god. 45 Dudley (η. 1), 163; the fragments were reorganized from their order in Eusebius by Hammerstaedt, cf. Hammerstaedt (n. 39), 70. 46 A. Brancacci, 'Liberia e fato in Enomao di Gadara', in id. (éd.), La filosofia in età impéri ale: le scuole e le tradizioni filosofiche. Atti del colloquio, Roma, 17-19 Giugno 1999 (Naples, 2000), 37-67; Brancacci (n. 39). 47 Other authors dealing with these issues, e.g. Cicero, Plutarch, Dio Chrysostom and Maximus of Tyre, criticize the ignorance of the public who frequented the sanctuaries, but blame neither the god nor even the oracle officials; references in Hammerstaedt (n. 38), 2854-60. Eusebius in the Praep. evang. interprets the invective as against 'the deceptions and sophisms of human charlatans contrived to deceive the multitude' (γοήτων S' ανδρών πλάνας και σοφίσματα ΐπι άπάτ-η των πολλών Ισκΐυωρημΐνα, 5.21.6.3) and 'the feebleness of both the givers and the receivers' (το αδρανές τών Te χρώντων και τών χρωμάνων, 5.26.41). 48 Julian. Or. 6.17 calls him αναιδή ς ... αναίσχυντος ... όπιρυπτης πάντων ομού Οι ίων Te και ανθρωπίνων, in contrast to Diogenes being eύλaβής ... τα προς το deîov; Hammerstaedt (η. 39), 28-32. In contrast to Julian, Eusebius of course found in Oenomaus a convenient pagan rejecting his own religion.</page><page sequence="9">LUCIAN AMONG THE CYNICS 793 Oenomaus' speech would have been recognized as typically Cynic παρρησία and αναίδεια.49 Lucian was evidently attracted to the literary potential of Cynic style, which he knew from the works of Menippus. Its vitality, its impertinence and its ability to expose pretence - these suited both his satirical aims and the dramatic require ments of his own novel genre, the combination of dialogue with Old Comedy.50 In the Double Indictment, 'the Syrian' is called to defend himself, first against the accusation of abandoning Rhetoric for Dialogue, and then against the further accusation of dragging Dialogue down (from the lofty heights of Platonism) to the common level of humanity; the Syrian forced Dialogue to play the buffoon in the company of Comedy, Jest, Lampoon and Cynicism, in particular of Menippus. The Syrian from his side argues that he made Dialogue, who was at that stage respectable but old and sour, attractive again. To the extent that this character's voice resembles that of the author, Lucian's claim was of revitalizing the genre by introducing humour and Cynic elements into it. Casting the arguments of an invective (in Oenomaus) into dialogue form has additional benefits. It allows Lucian to turn the addressed god (Apollo in Oenomaus) into a full-blown character (Zeus) with his own malleable voice. It also creates greater distance between author and narrative spokesperson than would be the case in direct speech, where the narrative voice is intuitively identified with the authorial voice. The extra distance allows Lucian more freedom to manipulate his characters, to make - in the case of Cyniscus - thorough use of Cynic παρρησία, but to tone down the typical Cynic acerbity characteristic of Oenomaus and his fellows. Cyniscus is bold and relentless, but remains cool and civil throughout. The difference in tone relates to another generic distinction between Oenomaus and Lucian. The Charlatans Exposed is satiric in the traditional sense of the word: its aim is to ruthlessly expose vices and follies, using wit, irony and sarcasm. The Zeus Refuted, on the other hand, dresses up its satiric elements as parody, which is by definition more concerned with literary imitation than satire.51 The parodie treatment of literary forebears applies both to the Homeric Zeus and to Platonic dialogue, right up to the Socratic απορία in the final lines. In a sense, then, Lucian's generic manipulation and originality allows him to present Cynic tradition in apparel more palatable to the intellectual elite who were his intended audience and who expected constant reference to classical literature. The very aspect of generic originality in Lucian may itself be seen as Cynic. The Cynics were among the great literary innovators of antiquity. They put the Cynic stamp on philosophical genres such as dialogues, politeiai, symposia and epistles, incorporated and redefined chreiai and gnomai for their own purposes, and promoted extraliterary genres such as wills and diaries to satirical instruments.52 The tragedies of Diogenes were in all probability travesties on honoured mythical themes: his Oedipus mocking views on the oracles and perhaps incest, his Thyestes doing the same with cannibalism, and so forth.53 Oenomaus put himself firmly in 49 Euseb. Praep. evang. 5.21.6: τοιαύτα της Οίνομάου παρρησίας τα της των Γοητων φώρας, κυνικής ουκ απηλλαγμένα πικρίας. 50 Bis acc. 32-4; cf. Hall (η. 5), 64-74. 51 Oenomaus' satire is not devoid of parodie elements; cf. Hammerstaedt (η. 39), 407. 52 Cf. Diog. Laert. 6.101 on Menippus' writings; Branham (n. 20), 85. 53 On the literary output of Diogenes, cf. G. Giannantoni, Socraticorum reliquiae, vol. 3 (Naples, 1990), 461-84.</page><page sequence="10">794 PHILIP R. BOSMAN the tradition of Cynic writing with tragedies and a Republic of his own.54 However, these amusing abuses of literary conventions never became a rhetorical goal in themselves. Cynic σπουΒαιογέλοιον combined wit and comic effect with serious intent, even though the percentages of the mix varied among its exponents.55 Lucian can be seen as belonging to the 'frivolous' side of the tradition along with Bion and Menippus. How does Lucian relate to the Cynics of his era? The usual picture of the imperial Cynics is two-sided: on the one hand, a great number of uneducated charlatans who shamelessly heaped abuse on passers-by in the urban centres of the empire but scandalized the Cynic way by their moral depravity; on the other hand, Socratic figures such as Demonax and Demetrius who lived frugally according to Cynic principles and were respected across philosophical divides. But some Cynics complicate the Janus face: Dio Chrysostom with his 'Cynic period' and evident inclinations towards the sect, Theagenes treated with respect by Galen but lambasted by Lucian,56 and Oenomaus, an evidently educated man practising literary αναίδεια. It seems more productive to break down Cynicism into its component parts and to accept that someone could claim to be a Cynic even if he or she were only true to one or two of these parts. Cynicism - in the briefest terms - was known for (1) a compact set of principles derived from nature; (2) a radical way of life in adherence to these principles; (3) ruthless criticism of societal follies; (4) humour and wit; and (5) literary inventiveness. Oenomaus, as we have seen, indulges in some 'positive philosophy', but the famous Cynic protreptic is absent. Lucian not only omits the Cynic life, but steers away altogether from philosophical ground ing. Both, however, remain Cynic in their polemics against folly, their reliance on σπουδαιογέλοιον and παρρησία and their literary adventurousness. Their most notable predecessor in this particular brand of Cynicism was Menippus, regarded as a degenerate Cynic for not adhering to the austere Cynic life.57 It seems that Lucian may indeed find a home in an accommodating definition of Roman Cynicism. Ancient evidence supports a 'broad church' view: not only was there uncertainty as to whether Cynicism could count as a aipeais, but even to those including it among the schools, its τέλος was a matter of controversy. It was structurally, like the other Hellenistic schools, geared towards happiness in practical conformation to nature. But later authors significantly found the Cynic τ έλος not simply in the practical life: Julian lists more than one τέλος, among them 'contempt for vain opinion' and the 'search for truth', while Clemens mentions that the goal of life for Antisthenes was άτυφία, presumably in the sense of 'without delusion/ nonsense' as opposed to the Cynic vice of τύφος.5* Such formulations represent Cynicism in offensive mode. In this mode, the Cynic uses rational argument to expose logical inconsistency and does not mind where the argument originated as 54 Oenomaus' literary output is listed in the Suda and Julian. Or. 6.187c; cf. Hammerstaedt (n. 39), 2835 η. 1; 2843-53. 55 Cf. Diog. Laert. 6.83 on Monimus; Menippus is first explicitly referred to as σπουδαιογβλοιο?; cf. Strabo 16.2.29. 56 Gal. Method, medendi 13.15; cf. Bernays (n. 12), 14-18. 57 Dudley (η. 1), 70. Dudley calls the mocking scepticism of Menippus, Oenomaus and Lucian the 'peculiar Syrian contribution to Greek literature' (170), but it probably goes back to Bion; cf. Κ. Kindstrand, Bion of Borysthenes (Uppsala, 1976); on Cynic literature of the imperial age, see M.-O. Goulet-Cazé, 'Le cynisme à l'époque impériale', ANRW 2.36.4:2800-6. 58 Julian.

This is, of course, as true for most of the Diogenes tradition as for Oenomaus and Lucian, and hence for literary Cynicism. However, there is an important difference between Cynic anecdotes and Cynic writing: the anecdote tradition focusses on the Cynic as-exemplum, but that aspect diminishes in the Cynic-as-author; the former puts the Cynic on display, the latter exposes his adversaries. Are we to judge Lucian's indebtedness to Cynicism on the basis of a precon ceived and probably limiting definition of the Cynicism of his age, or are we to allow Lucian to influence and expand our conception of what Cynicism of the second century entailed? Who were the true heirs of Diogenes? 'You are not a Cynic', Lucian has his pet hate Peregrinus accuse his hero Demonax. 'And you', replies Demonax, 'are not human' (Demon. 21). In Demonax, Lucian finds a 'philosopher' able to surpass the narrow confines of school philosophy, looking for truth beyond the divides. This 'philosopher' is identified as a Cynic. Furthermore, within Cynic tradition he discovers the tools he requires to produce entertaining satire: παρρησία, humour, mocking exposure, the rhetorical stance designed to attack folly. His novel combination of Old Comedy and the earnest philosophical genre of the dialogue virtually necessitated his affinity with the Cynic tradition. Lucian writes for a sophisticated audience who expected allusions to the Greek literary heritage. He displays his own brand of sophistry by means of playful parody of classical characters and literary forms, albeit not without earnestness underlying the jest. In Cynic tradition he finds the appropriate vehicle for his literary endeavour: it offers irreverent outspokenness, brave exposure of stupidity, serious criticism mixed with ridicule and wit, and literary imagination. He is able to remain aligned to the philosophy's content without sounding philosophical, and he deliberately stops short of stating premises and presenting theoretical exposition. He has no wish to preach or win adherents, or to present a full account of the philosophy. Like that of Epictetus, his Cynicism is stripped of the (unattractive) harshness and anti-cultured aspects of Diogenes and the vulgar Cynics of the times, but it still differs from Epictetus' ideal Cynic sage. It is yet another strand within the tradition: a second century a.d. version of literary Cynicism, one that has become embarrassed with school allegiance, in which the famous Cynic body rhetoric was eclipsed by entertaining critical display.
