The exhibition, which opened November 16, will close August 6 and begin a two-year tour of cities in Canada and the United States. Between 1875 and 1925, Canadian soldiers and missionaries traveled to Africa to campaign on secular and spiritual battlefields. On their jour- neys through what was then often called the "Unknown Continent," they gathered up hundreds of African artifacts for reasons that tell us as much about the collectors as about the people who created the objects. Their diaries and letters give voice to long-forgotten events in distant lands. The artifacts themselves speak of the varied economies, political structures, and belief systems of their African makers. Combining anthro- pology and history in the search for meaning in cross-cultural encounters, Into the Heart of Africa also takes a criti- cal look at one of our more important public institutions, the museum. Queen Victoria's jubilee in 1897, marking her 60 years on the throne, was extravagantly celebrated in Great Britain and throughout the Empire. Canada, as part of that empire, had horizons that were much broader than those defined by its own politi- cal boundaries. As British subjects, Canadians took an active part in all the opportunities an imperial power had to offer individuals in the domin- ions. According to popular historian James Morris, in that jubilee year "hundreds of thousands of British Canadians regarded the imperial saga as part of their own national heritage. The excitement of the New Imperialism was almost as intense in Toronto as it was in London." Some of that excitement was gener- ated through the popular adoration of the heroes of the age. The perfect British soldier was personified in Major General Sir Garnet Wolseley. Idolized by the public, he fought throughout the empire. His career as an imperial commander saw him leading the Red River expedition 48 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="3">Anthropomorphic pot from Zaire features a woman with an elaborate coif- fure .

A gold necklace in the exhibi- tion, described in an early catalog en- try as part of the spoils of war belong- ing to Wolseley, was taken in 1874 from Kumase, in what is now Ghana. It was probably the property of a per- son of high status. Sometimes neck- laces such as this one, with a rich selection of gold beads, were regarded not only as jewelry, but as protective charms, or amulets, as well. After Wolseley returned to England, he presented it to a family friend, whose descendants sold it to a benefactor of the Royal Ontario Museum. Of equal renown was the Scottish missionary-explorer Dr. David Liv- ingstone, the first European to see the thundering Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River. His exploits during his 30 years on the continent thrilled the English-speaking world, and in- spired several generations of Cana- dian missionaries to venture into the interior. Their vision, like his, was to replace "paganism" with Christianity, the slave trade with legitimate com- merce, and "barbarous" customs with their own form of civilization. En- countering unfamiliar cultures with world views radically different from their own, those missionaries who re- turned home brought back many sou- venirs and trophies of their journeys. These encounters are explored throughout the exhibition. The Rev- erend A.W. Banfield of Toronto brought back more than 4,000 pho- tographs taken at various times dur- ing his long career in Africa between 1901 and 1930. Offering both insight and illusion, they act as mirrors that reveal some of his own culturad as- sumptions, as well as those of his sub- jects. In his book Life Among the Nupe Tribe in West Africa, published in 1905, he wrote "to plait a woman's hair is by no means a small task, for the hair is very thick and also very curly. A Nupe woman takes more care about the way her hair is done up than many would think." In a photograph taken in 1903, Banfield captured Nupe women dressing each other's hair. A large mask, brought back to Canada by the Reverend Thomas Titcombe, who in 1908 had joined the Sudan Interior Mission bound for Nigeria, also attests to cross-cultural interaction. Titcombe worked among the Yagba (a Yoruba sub-group) for the next 22 years until ill health forced his return home. It is not known from whom or exactly when he acquired this mask. He did tell his family, however, that it was pre- sented to him by an "old witch doctor" who had converted to Christianity. Titcombe kept the mask to remind him of his first days in the mission field and the experiences he shared with the Yagba, as their lives inter- twined in colonial Nigeria. Today, during the Epa festival, held every two years between March and May, these masks play a role in ensuring the well-being of the community. Each mask is the property of a line- age group, and marks memorable events in local history, drawing atten- tion to outstanding village personal- ities. At the same time, the rituali performance itself, often including several masks, celebrates the cultural values of the Yoruba. The basic mask consists of an elaborate superstructure borne by a helmet-mask with two faces. The maile figure in this example wears a large magical hat and is flanked by representations of wrought iron staffs with bells and of antelope horns filled with medicine for procuring ritual power. Before him is a square divina- tion board, its upper surface deco- rated with the face of Eshu, the deity who acts as an intermediary, bearing sacrifices to the gods. These icono- 50 Archaeology</page><page sequence="4">Bronze plaques from Benin City documented triumphs of the empire . graphic clues suggest that the figure is a priest of Osanyin, the god of her- bal medicine, or an Ifa diviner. In everyday practice, the priests of Osanyin are not only powerful her- balists but healers of the psyche as well. Equally respected are the ritual practitioners who seek to use super- natural wisdom on behalf of their human clients, through the Ifa divi- nation system. Museums are often accused of be- ing cultural charnel houses, full of the remains of dead civilizations. Sometimes there has been an element of truth in the allegation. A museum's uncritical emphasis on a traditional culture and an aboriginal or precon- tact past can foster a sense of an unchanging society. This is not always easy to correct. The core of the col- lections at the Royal Ontario Mu- seum is made up of objects amassed in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of our own. As such, the collections are historical, and it is impossible even to suggest through these objects the complexities of contemporary African life at the end of the twentieth cen- tury. What one can do, however, is realize that the lifeways of all peoples change; no one lives in a collective state of suspended animation. A creative African response to change, for example, can be seen in a Mangbetu or Mamvu pot from Zaire, which features a woman with an elaborate coiffure. These peoples considered an elongated skull a sign of beauty, and it was produced by binding the head soon after birth. An- thropomorphic vessels of this kind were produced for a very short pe- riod, beginning about the same time as Belgian colonial rule. The presence of Europeans stimulated a demand for particular kinds of objects, includ- ing figurative pots. They seem to have functioned not only as prestige items within Mangbetu society, but also as chiefly gifts to foreigners. Some pots may have been commissioned directly by non-Africans from artists partici- pating in the growing cash economy in the area. Museums also compete with each other in their acquisitions, and as a result collections often come to resem- ble one another as certain kinds of artifacts, such as the famous metal- work from Benin become popular. The Benin Bronzes, as they are col- lectively known, caused a public sen- sation when first seen in Europe at the very end of the nineteenth cen- tury. Part of that interest was gener- ated by the spectacular circumstances in which the objects were acquired. Benin City had for centuries been the capital of one of West Africa's most successful precolonial states. When it fell in 1897 to a British pu- nitive expedition, much of the city and the huge wooden palace of the oba , or king, was burned. After the capture of the town, several hundred leaded brass plaques were removed. Some were later sold to help recoup the costs of the campaign. Probably dating to the early seven- teenth century, these plaques were originally attached to wooden pillars in the palace, where they document- ed the triumphs of the oba's empire; or illustrated the complexities of daily life at his court. Included in the ex- hibition is a plaque depicting what is almost certainly a retainer in that court. He wears a headdress or beaded cap and a loincloth, has what may be a bell hanging from a sash across his chest, and carries a sword tucked under his arm. Four stylized crocodile heads mark the corners of the plaque. Symbols of power, they were the favorite sacrifice to Olokun, god of the sea. The great skill required to cast the plaques was recognized early on, although it was sometimes errone- ously attributed to non-African crafts- men. Easily understood, the subject matter was made more compelling by its exoticism and association with what British newspapers reporting on the punitive expedition called the "City of Blood." Today the Benin Bronzes are some of the most expen- sive African pieces offered for sale on the international art market. We can understand something of the complexities of these encounters by examining the motives that in- fluenced the formation of museum collections, the collections themselves as cultural texts, and the "life his- tories" of particular objects. In the same process, the intricacies of differ- ent cultures are revealed in objects through which various African peo- ples have expressed not only their individual artistry, but also their deepest communal concerns. Finally, by placing in context the relation- ships, however brief, problematic, and painful, that developed as Canadian soldiers and missionaries traveled into the heart of Africa, it has become clear that the past is part of the present. ‚ñ† Jeanne Cannizzo, curator of Into the Heart of Africa, has conducted research in Sierra Leone and broadcasts regularly for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
