The 'De regimini principum' and Associated Traditions. Ronald W. Truman. Leiden: Brill, 1999. 414 pp. C108,00. ISBN 9004113797. New interpretations of key aspects of early modern Spanish history, such as the nature of Habsburg rule, the timing and extent of economic decline, or the impact of the Inquisi- tion, are increasingly well established in Spanish histories, bringing the field more in line with developments in European history. Such a trend, however, has been far less evident in the field of Spanish political thought. For this reason, Ronald Truman's book, a rich and very thoroughly researched reflection of his long-standing interest in these matters, stands out as a remarkable achievement. It covers the centuries-old genre of Specula principis as it was practiced during the reign of Philip II (1556-1598) by means of a detailed analysis of the contents of twelve such trea- tises on the education, duties, and performance of not only the king but also of royal coun- selors and municipal officials. Truman divides the authors of these texts into four groups: Spanish writers in the Spanish Netherlands in the 1550s (e.g., Sebastiin Fox Morcillo, Fe- lipe de la Torre, Fadrique Furio Ceriol), writers on aldermen (e.g., Juan Costa, Juan de Castilla y de Aguayo, Jer6nimo Castillo de Bovadilla), writers in the Crown of Aragon (e.g., Tom~is Cerdin de Tallada, Jer6nimo Merola, Marco Antonio Cam6s), and finally Jesuit the- orists (e.g., Juan de Torres, Pedro de Ribadeneyra, Juan de Mariana). Each of these authors receives a full chapter devoted to himself, while a chapter on the Specula in general, a short introduction to each group, and a final conclusion make up the rest of the book. The point of departure is the religious crisis unleashed in 1557-1559, when following the discovery of a large number of alleged crypto-Protestants in Valladolid and Seville, the Inquisition held two major autos-da-fi and eventually arrested the archbishop of Toledo. These events have been long viewed as a turning point in Spanish intellectual life, for they led to the establishment of a cordon sanitaire that drove Spain into cultural isolation. The au- thor tests the efficacy of this cordon by looking for influences on the Spanish authors in question from wider European cultural trends.While not denying the importance of the re- ligious crisis, he shows that the treatises wound up expounding a variety of positions-he speaks of a variety of voices-many of which clearly echoed cultural and religious debates abroad. Themes such as Augustinianism, renewed emphasis on the laity, Biblicism, hermeti- cism, and skepticism thus appeared in the pages of these treatises in varying degrees of strength. Moreover, Truman presents important new evidence for the influence of Machia- velli on Fox and Furi6, and for Mariana's familiarity with Bodin, and demonstrates that nu- anced forms of Erasmianism continued to flourish after the midcentury crisis. He also shows substantial differences among the Jesuits-Ribadeneyra and Mariana appear as poles apart on many issues-and convincingly argues that only one among his authors, Ribadeneyra, firmly adhered to Counter-Reformation orthodoxy, which leads him to sug- gest that the term should be used more sparingly and with greater rigor. Truman applies a strongly internalist approach to his subject. He provides biographical information on the authors, and is up to date in the recent historiography of the Inquisi- tion. But, by far, the bulk of his research addresses the inner contents of each treatise, which he carefully examines in terms of auctoritates, sources, borrowings, and arguments. He takes care to note that the twelve books, taken as a whole, lack a systematic character. Nonethe- less, when analyzing individual authors, he helpfully draws the reader's attention to similar reasoning in the other texts. By the reign of Philip II, the Speculum genre had become quite versatile, for under similar titles one finds a broad range of contents.While all of them had</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 487 something to say about the four cardinal virtues, some, such as those by Fox Morcillo or Mariana, included interesting opinions on finances and other economic issues. Castillo de Bovadilla dealt hardly at all with the figure of the corregidor appearing in his title, but instead wrote at length on royal prerogative vis-a-vis ecclesiastical and other jurisdictions. Religion, economics, and politics were all fair game for these authors. The wide geographical coverage of the book (Flanders, Castile, Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia) also deserves mention, especially given its rarity in recent Spanish bibliogra- phy. However, Truman's analytical grouping of the authors is not without problems. The Aragonese Juan Costa is not placed in the section on writers in the Crown of Aragon, but rather in that of writers on municipal officials. True, Costa taught at Salamanca and wrote on the regidor or ciudadano, but much of his approach belongs to the tradition of civic hu- manism, much more alive in Barcelona and his native Saragossa than in Castile. At the same time, though, one does not find in Costa, nor in his fellow Valencians and Catalans Furi6, Cerdain, Merola, and Cam6s, much discussion of the fueros or other constitutionalist aspects of these territories-a rather striking absence that Truman does not emphasize enough. Many of the authors selected for study, notably Fox, Furi6, and Costa, professed a spe- cial interest in the practicalities of government, and put aside the depiction of an ideal ruler or rejected scholastic teachings as useless. All the same, they sometimes failed to fulfill their empiricist claims (Cerdn). Similarly, their explicit approval of "active life" allows Truman to show their connections with humanist pedagogical trends and particularly with Francesco Patrizzi. He also skillfully notes their similarities with a wide range of authors, including Giles of Rome, the founder of the Speculum genre by the late thirteenth century. And while rightly warning (378) that similarities should not be confused with direct influ- ences or debts, Truman searches far and wide, especially among Italian theorists, for evi- dence of wider European parallels, while neglecting local, Spanish influences. The Valencian Francesc Eiximenis, author of the Dotzen libre del regiment de princeps (1453) and other re- lated books, fails to appear, although Francisco Monz6n is duly mentioned. The same can be said for Spanish legal literature, which is referred to only occasionally. The twelve theorists are dealt with in equal detail. This allows little-studied names, such as Castilla y Aguayo or Cam6s, to figure alongside such well-known writers as Fox or Furi6. This tactic greatly enhances our knowledge of the overall field of writing, but at the same time it tends to blur the relative originality of each author. The importance of Merola's commonplace anthropomorphic analogy of the body politic, for example, pales when placed alongside Mariana's thesis on tyrannicide. Mariana's significance is enhanced further when one takes into consideration his other writings, such as his important pam- phlet on the coinage problem and his history of Spain, wherein he further developed his constitutionalist ideas. In any event, Truman's list of primary sources is truly impressive. The secondary bibli- ography is also rich, although H. Puigdomenech's Maquiavelo en Espahia (1988) and E Rico's El pequefio mundo del hombre (1986, 2d ed.) are overlooked.While J.Ma Ifiurritegui's La gracia y la repuiblica (1998), on Ribadeneyra, is a noteworthy and a highly welcome example of the latest methods in the study of political thought and language, Ronald Truman's book, firmly grounded in a more traditional approach, amply demonstrates the complexities of Spanish cultural life in the second half of the sixteenth century. It is without question one of the most remarkable contributions to this field from the past ten or fifteen years. Xavier Gil............................... Universitat de Barcelona</page></plain_text>
