<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS descriptive of a true "Christian" experience. (Incidentally, his statement on pp. 437-440 is extremely good as a summary of Paul's ethical teaching in Romans - better than much that went before on the subject!) This leads one finally to observe that, despite Nygren's prolixity, in the end he does not adequately define such important terms as "righteousness," "flesh," "body," "faith," "in Christ." Far too much space is devoted to say- ing what these terms do not mean and far too little as to what they do signify. To take but one example, it is not adequate to remark that " 'unrighteousness' is not, for Paul, a moralistic concept. Its opposite is not human righteousness, man's moral well-doing, but the righteousness of God" (p. 110), and much more to the same effect. For what is the "righteousness of God" but the Bib- lical term for the normative "moralistic concept" for man? Doubtless it is much more than that; but it is at least that. The moral concept is not to be defined by reference to anthropomorphic customary human action, as by both Greeks and Romans -granted. How then is it to be defined, but by the theomorphic righteous action of God, as with the prophets of Israel? Both "righteousness" and "unrighteousness," then, instead of being emptied of all meaning whatever, are to be defined as "moralistic concepts" which de- rive their true meaning by reference to the moral Person of God. JOHN WICK BOWMAN Svensk Exegetisk Arsbok, XII, 1947, edited by Anton Fridrichsen in behalf of the Uppsala Exegetical Society, and including as a supplement Symbolae Biblicae Upsalienses, 9: "Exegetische Probleme des zweiten Korintherbriefes," by Rudolf Bultmann. Uppsala, 1947. Pp. 373+31. With its eighteen independent articles in Swedish, two in Norwegian, one in Danish, and a supplement in German, this annual amounts to a periodical. JBL does not review the contents of other periodicals, but an exception is made in this case because it is written in the Scandinavian languages. Only the briefest digest of each article can be given. Tomas Arvedson: "Jesus as a Mock King." A comparative-religion study of the mocking of Jesus. From Egyptian, Babylonian, Hittite, and Roman parallels it is asserted that the motif of the mock king comes out of the sphere of ideas connected with the Oriental New Year's festival. Apparently the author is not contesting the historicity of the incident, but merely suggesting that the soldiers, far from being inventive in their mockery, were only follow- ing a pattern of familiar custom. 285</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Aage Bentzen: "Can the Word 'Messianic' be Used of the Psalter's Con- ceptions of the King?" The answer is a guarded yes midway between Mo- winckel's denial and Graham and May's assertion. He attempts to show that the "divine king" and the "Son of Man" are not so unrelated as com- monly supposed. Ragnar Bring: "Reflections on the Interpretation of Gal 3 19 f." Does Paul intend to depreciate the Law in a semi-Gnostic sense by his mention of angels and a mediator in 19? No; on the contrary, Paul says it ad majorem gloriam legis, just as Acts 7 53 does. The Law itself is holy, righteous, and good; only its use as a means to salvation is evil. Lyder Brun: "Rom 7 7-25 Once More." A keenly-reasoned argument against the interpretation of Rom 7 in Nygren's recent commentary on Romans (Nygren revives the Augustine-Luther view that Paul is here describing the predicament of Christian living). Brun contends - unanswerably, I believe- that the whole passage deals with pre-Christian life. Carl-Martin Edsman: "Old and New Typological Interpretation of the Old Testament." A thoughtful weighing of the question whether the "typo- logical" interpretation found in some passages of the NT, in the exegesis of the ancient Church, in the folk-art of the Church, in Luther, and in some contemporary theologians has not still at least an equal place side by side with "historical" interpretation. The author defends, with some reservations, the medieval conception of the "four-fold" interpretation of Scripture. Ivan Engnell: "Prophecy and Tradition." This is an apologia for Engnell's view of the prophetic books as precipitates of tradition. It is prefaced by a useful review of the scientific interpretation of the prophets from Herder to the present, culminating, evidently, in Mowinckel's work and the author's own Gamla Testamentet. The article polemizes particularly against the whole school of literary or source-criticism with its "romantic" and "arbitrary" assumption of evolution in Hebrew religion in general, and in the prophets in particular. Anton Fridrichsen: "Scholia in Novum Testamentum." 1. Lk 22 31. The "sifting" of the disciples is perhaps to be understood in keeping with Amos 9 9, where a coarse sieve is implied that would let the grain through and hold back the straw: Luke, too, may imply the difficult passage of the kernels (the disciples) through the narrow openings, a passage that would be impossible but for the possibility created by Jesus' intercessory prayer. 2. Rom 1 17. The pair of prepositions K--i with repeated common object does not in- dicate an increase of faith, but is pleonastically rhetorical, yielding the mean- 286</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS ing: Gospel and righteousness have to do simply and solely with faith - "sola fide." 3. I Pet 3 7. Wherein lies the "weakness" of the wife? In her physical disadvantage and her greater psychic sensitiveness? No, answers Fridrichsen - that is a Stoic idea - but in her greater susceptibility to Satan's seduction - which is a Jewish-Christian idea (cf. I Tim 2 12-15 and perhaps I Cor 11 10). He would translate somewhat as follows: "Live with your wives according to the knowledge that woman is a very weak vessel (i. e., guard them care- fully from the many dangers to which they are known, from Scripture and our instruction, to be exposed) but (as if Aiev ... 6e stood before the parti- ciples) bestowing honor upon them as joint heirs of grace ..." All emphasis, he believes, lies upon the absolute religious equality of husband and wife in spite of her public, social subordination. Gillis Gerleman: "Ezekiel's Gog." Gog is neither a historical people nor a historical person, but a symbolic figure of eschatological expectation. But where did Ezekiel get the name? From Num 24 7, the same passage from which the other names in Ezek 38 come - but from the LXX-Samar. text, which the author regards as the textus receptus before the Masoretes. Rafael Gyllenberg: "The Good Samaritan." The story is to be understood within its present frame, as Luke gives it. Jesus' intention with the story is to explain how one becomes ('yeovevat, Lk 10 36) neighbor to another. Ivar Hylander: "Is There a Righteousness by Faith in the Old Testament?" Yes, especially in the prophets and the Psalms; but not in the completely Christian sense, which does not exist without the fulfilment of the promise in Jesus Christ. Aarre Lauha: "Some Marginal Notes on the Discussion Concerning the King-Ideology in the Old Testament." This is a spirited protest against the tendency of the Uppsala "school" to regard the king-ideology as the universal key to OT problems - an interesting note to find in a work issuing from Uppsala, many of whose contributions are steeped in this ubiquitous ideology. Gosta Lindeskog: "The Letter of Christ, II Cor 3 1-3." The metaphor of the "letter" in these three verses cannot be considered as one consistent figure of speech; rather, it is a chain of changing associations released by the word "letter." Olof Linton: "A Contradiction and Its Fate, Gal 1 and 2; Acts 9 and 15." According to the author we have not two versions of the "apostolic council," but three, the third being the version held by the Galatians; it can be largely reconstructed from Paul's polemic against it in Gal. This third version was related to that preserved in Acts; in other words, in spite of Paul's personal 287</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE protest, the false version held by the Galatians continued to exist, and, some- what altered by tradition, was taken up into Acts. Sigmund Mowinckel: "Nathan's Promise, II Sam 7." A study in Iberliefer- ungsgeschichte. The author classifies this as a theological-etiological legend, arising not out of a historical kernel, but out of later speculations about why David built no temple. He believes it represents a stage of tradition lying somewhere between the really historical traditions of David and Chronicles' legendary tradition of David the cult-organizer. H. S. Nyberg: "Korah's Rebellion, Num 16 f." Another study in Uberlie- ferungsgeschichte and a strong protest against the extravagances of the school of literary criticism (but also, though incidentally, against applying the "king- ideology" to Moses- "a hypothesis," he says, "highly conjectural in itself, which has been ridden to death"). Analysis of Num 16 and 17 leads to the conclusion that the distinct but related rebellions of Korah (religious) and of Dathan and Abiram (political) had already circulated together in tradition and do not bear witness to two "sources" artificially combined by the "author." Hence the tradition of Korah's rebellion and of Aaron's priesthood is not post- exilic (against the Wellhausen school) but is "a very early stratum of Israel's religious traditions." Anders Nygren: "Christ the Mercy Seat." Should hilasterion in Rom 3 25 be considered concrete (mercy seat) - as it clearly must in Heb 9 5 - or ab- stract (propitiation, expiation, means of obtaining mercy)? Nygren decides firmly for the former, considering that Paul intends to say that God trans- ferred the functions of the mercy seat to Christ: it was the place where God revealed himself and the place where atonement, or reconciliation, occurred. Ernst Percy: "The Parable Theory in Mk 4 11 f. and the Composition of Mk 41-34." This is an original and credible solution of the problem of Mk 4. The allegorical interpretation of the parable of the sower is secondary to the parable itself and cannot be attributed to Jesus; but the parable and its inter- pretation were already combined in the tradition before "Mark" (or a pred- ecessor) composed the tertiary theory in 10-12. Furthermore, the fact that the tradition had found an interpretation necessary was the occasion for that theory: the parable must have been a riddle without it. The "center of grav- ity" in this parable theory is not that the parables were hidden from the understanding of outsiders, but is in the other half: that their meaning was revealed to the disciples (for the evangelist=the Church). Percy regards 10-12 as the kernel of 4 1-34 as it now stands. Bo Reicke: "Micah 7 as a Messianic Text." A genuine Uppsala-school 288</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS ("king-ideology") study of Mic 7. Beginning with Gunkel's conception of 7 7-20 as a liturgy of some (unidentified) festival of mourning, Reicke extends the liturgy backward to include the entire chapter and proceeds to identify the festival: it is no other than the Israelitic New Year celebration after the autumn harvest. The "central figure" of the chapter ("I") is the king (or his cultic substitute), who embodies and personifies the people. Though this is the liturgy of an annually recurring festival, it nevertheless contains es- chatological motifs - and "the king" is ultimately the Messiah-King. Hence, Reicke concludes, Mt 10 35 and Lk 12 53 are quite right in quoting it as a Messianic text; he sees no good reason to question that Jesus himself had quoted it in this sense. Gunnar Rudberg: "Concerning Codex Cantabrigiensis." Rudberg con- siders the "riddle of Codex D" still unsolved. Particularly the additional material in D deserves attention because it is of a type not at all common in ancient MSS - not glosses, but new factual material. Referring to his own work (1915) on the abbreviations of the nomina sacra and their primitive character in Acts (D), he calls for an unprejudiced reconsideration of Codex D as a whole, especially of its own linguistic peculiarities. Erik Sjoberg: "Though Your Sins Be as Scarlet ..." Is the clause that follows to be regarded as a promise of forgiveness (as in the traditional Jew- ish and Christian interpretation) or as an ironical question (the frequent "learned" interpretation since Michaelis, 1779, and in many modern com- mentaries and translations)? Sj6berg answers that there is no good reason to question the traditional interpretation; it can be reconciled with Isaiah's message in general, and Is 1 18a is to be translated: "Come, let us enter into right relations with each other." Albert Wifstrand: "A Problem of Word-Order in the New Testament." Why is it that 80 to 90% of the enclitic pronominal forms in the Gospels immediately follow the noun or verb to which they are grammatically re- lated, whereas in "literary" Greek they preponderantly precede or are sep- arated by intervening words? Particularly, is this difference due to Semitic influence? By what appears to be a very exact analysis of a vast amount of literature from Plato to modern Greek and from papyrus letters to philosophic treatises, the author arrives at the conclusion that everyday Greek since Hel- lenistic times has shown an ever-increasing tendency to place enclitic pro- nouns as the Gospels do, while literary Greek has had marked preference for the other possible orders. This is one more detail of proof that the Gospels are written in the everyday language of the people. 289</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE The supplement, "Exegetical Problems of II Cor.," by Rudolf Bultmann. 1. II Cor 5 1-5. This is a polemical digression apropos of U6&amp;a (4 1i), which Paul aims at gnosticizing Christians in Corinth who mistakenly think that the goal of Christian longing is to be unclothed, found naked. But what does the "destruction of the earthly tent" (1) mean -death? or the "change" (I Cor 15 51) at the parousia and resurrection? Bultmann answers: for Paul's gnosticizing opponents, the former; for Paul himself, the latter-though of course the hope of the resurrection-garment at the parousia exists also for those who die before the parousia. (Bultmann decides flatly in favor of the reading uKovUaa,CevoL in 3.) 2. "The Progress of Thought in 5 11-6 10"-a discussion too full of details for treatment in this brief review; it must be read in toto. (An important footnote (p. 14) gives Bultmann's critical analysis of II Cor: 2 14- 6 13, 7 2-14, and chs. 10-13 belong to one letter, the so-called intermediate letter; 1 1- 2 13 and 7 -16 constitute the letter written after Titus' return. He leaves chs. 8-9 with a question-mark, but declares that they can- not have originally belonged together.) 3. "II Cor 10-13." Who are the competitors against whom Paul contends in these chapters? Not delegates of the Jerusalem church with the authority of the apostles behind them, an- swers Bultmann (against Kasemann, ZNW, 41, 1942), but Jewish-Christians of a Hellenistic-Gnostic type. And the "superlative apostles" of 11 5 and 12 11 are not the Jerusalem apostles, nor are they distinct from the interlopers at Corinth (Kasemann); they are identical with the interlopers. 4. "II Cor 12 21." The ,u-clause of 21, like those of 20, is dependent upon "I fear" (20) and must have a parallel meaning. But what Paul fears in 20 is clearly that he may have to take severe action when he comes. Only, how could that be a "humiliation" (20) for Paul? Would it not rather be a proof of Christ's power working through Paul? Bultmann proposes to cut the knot with a conjectural emendation (a rare measure with Bultmann!): read ,uov ov ra- reLwYca,. With this emendation, what Paul fears is that God may not (this time) make him humble before the congregation, but stern instead - but he would like to be able to be mild for the sake of the all-important upbuilding (19) of the congregation. The whole annual is dedicated to Johannes Lindblom, professor in Lund, on his sixty-fifth birthday and retirement. Appropriately a bibliography of his many writings is included in the volume.
