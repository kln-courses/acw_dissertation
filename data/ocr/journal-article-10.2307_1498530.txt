<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rock Art in the Navajo Reservoir District. By Polly Schaafsma. (Museum of New Mexico Papers in Anthropology, No. 7. Sante Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press, 1963. Pp. vi + 74. Illus. $3.00.) This study is a result of salvage archeology operations in Region 3 of the Navajo Reservoir District of the Upper Colorado Storage Project. This dam will inundate the Pine River Valley (where all but two of the sites are lo- cated) nearly as far north as the Colorado state line, and also the San Juan River including the Piedra River, a tributary in Colorado. The "Pueblo" petroglyphs are chiefly "broad-shouldered" men, commonly isolated, but sometimes in hand-holding groups, or dancing, or hunting various animals. Body parts (fingers, toes, genitals), headdresses, chest ornaments, flutes, bows, and rain-symbols also occur. Painted yeis, or anthropomorphic supernaturals,</page><page sequence="2">264 WESTERN FOLKLORE are mostly in red, white, green, and buff. Flutes and phalloi suggest fertility magic; hunting scenes and animal tracks, hunting magic. The "Navajo" petroglyphs are commonly crosses or 4-petalled flowers in monochrome red, blue or buff, but some yeis are elaborately polychrome: the Twin War Gods and the humpbacked god have been identified. Hands, footprints, animals, and miscellaneous symbols resembling those in sand-paintings also occur. The Navajo pictographs are dated from the Gobernador Phase (A.D. 1698- 1775) and onward, the later ones becoming progressively more secularized. Such careful and well-illustrated studies as this are the backbone of arche- ology. WESTON LA BARRE Duke University</page></plain_text>
