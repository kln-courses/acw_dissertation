Campeche: Camps for Refugees from Guatemala GENF (M. Lienhardt). In March 1985, Martin Lienhardt had the opportunity to visit in the Mexican State of Campeche some of the camps established for refugees from Guatemala, where he received the following information from the people themselves or hy personal observation. As reported, the camps had been set up after May 29, 1984 in order to offer the refugees better protection than in the camps at the frontier in Chiapas, where they were threatened by the incursions of paramilitary units from Guatemala, and to give at least some of the refugees asssistance by means of long-term or permanent Settle ments based on intégration and economic self-sufficiency. (See mexicon V:5, VI: 14, and VI:62). i The situation in Kansayab, now Maya Tecum, is described as a typical example: Kanasayab is situated 37 km from Champotón in a practically Jt- 5SmI. *13 Children with individual houses in the background. Photograph: M. Lienhardt</page><page sequence="2">unpopulated région covered with bush forest. It is subdivided into three fairly close "modules " that is little villages, which shelter altogether 7653 refugees. The inhabitants of the modules 1 and 2 are mostly mestizos, while in number 3 live Maya Indians from five différent language groups": Mam, Canjobal, Chue, Quiché, Cakchiquel and Jacaltec. The village is planned on a typical campesino model with a central square and streets running into it at right angles, with some modifications according to the condition of the ground (flat or sloping). The type of house built at first had to be abandoned because its poor weather résistance. Houses are now of the kind traditional to northwestern Guatemala, but with a laminated roof It has dimensions of about 6 by 4 m and consists of a single room which serves for sleeping, living and eating, and a small adjacent kitchen. Every house has its own small vegetable garden. When construction was begun, insufficient attention was paid to proper loca tion of the houses, some of which therefore suffered from rain and flooding. In March, the relocation of endangered houses had been finished or was well under way. The problem of water supply, which was very serious because of the long periods of drought that characterize this zone (the hot clïmate requires certain adaptions by the Guatemaltecans) was recently solved by the installation of motor-driven pumps. The construction of the houses and the communal buildings which will serve the schoolchildren as well as ail the people (schools, sanitary installations, food stores and band-stands) is carried out collectively under the rules of self Organization which govern ail the camps. The construction materials - if they are not found in the surroundings of the camps as is the case with wood - are provided by COMAR (Comisión de Ayuda a los Refugiados) and paid for by the United Nations Commission for Refugees. Communal building. Photograph: M. Lienhardt The able-bodied men are busy cutting the bush to prepare the fields which in the middle term shall cover the supply of cereals and vegetables. Right now the COMAR provides the food (com, beans, oil, milk, chicken, rice, sugar, sait, potatoes, carrots, cabbage, calabazas, onions, bananas, eggs) and soap, while the refugees themselves have organized its distribution. It was planned that the men should go to work in tums in the regional agricultural enterprises in order to have some cash income. On the other hand, varions handicrafts are encouraged (weaving, carpentry, tailoring and Sewing), whose producís will form another source of cash. In the case of the module 3, the bilingual school service is in the hand of Guatemaltecan schoolmasters. The general State of the people (nutrition, health, hygiene, clothing) seems to be satisfactory and their attitude positive, which allows one to view their resett lementing with a certain optimism. CAMPECHE (INAH, mex) With regard to the refugee camps, José Enrique Ortiz Lanz, Director of the Centro Regional del INAH in Campeche, is afraid of a différent kind ofproblem: the camps are situated only 20 km away from the center of the important and very extensive archaeological site of Edzná, and it is feared that Edzná and its outskirts might extend right up to the camps, and that archaeological structures might be destroyed in order to construct modern buildings. The camps have been established without suffi cient consultation with INAH, which, for its part, has no exact knowledge of the real extent of the site bècause lack of funds has prevented the necessary survey. The exploration and charting of Edzná is now to be carried out as a matter of priority within the "Atlas Arqueológico"project. Day of the Dead 1985 in Mexico City GÖTTINGEN (mex). In Mexico City, the Day of the Dead, on November 2 this year was more celebrated in public than usual. Though the Mexican govemment (SEP) has for some time made general reference to the importance of popular costumes, it was more the mourning and public feeling after the earthquake of September 1985 that gave rise to the many "ofrendas" or altars for the dead to be seen in downtown Mexico City. While some of them had been arranged at the locations where a crumbling building had buried its inhabitants (as was the case with the Nuevo León apartment house at Tlatelolco), others had been placed in public areas where the implicit condemn was visible to Mexicans and foreigners alike. An altar at one side of the Cathedral in memory of the people from the popular barrio of Tepito who perished during the earthquake, with the typical flowers of zempasuchitl (tagetes erecta) and food, but also a Sew ing machine and other things associated with the dead. Photograph: Gerda Brückmann Latin American Bishops Pass a Resolution on Indigenous Policy LA PAZ (mex). The Consejo Episcopal Latino Americano (Latin American Bishops' Council) held a Conference from September 9 to 13, 1985, in Bogotá, Colombia, on the problems of missionary and government activities among Indians. The final resolution stated that Indian cultures have been suppressed for more than 500 years by colonization. Criticism was also leveled at the practice of some Latin American govemments, on the legislative level, of avoiding the words "Indian" and "native", using only "campesinos" or "marginados" instead. The resolution asks for support in the Indians' struggle for self détermination and ethnie identity, based on possession of land. Every indigenous policy that pursues genocidal aims by propagating the "rational" use of land, family planning or intégration into the national society, or by measures rationalised in terms of national unity or security, should be rejected and publicly denounced. Anthropologists Demand Self-Determination for American Natives. LAS PALMAS DE GRAN CANARIA (EFE). On December 7 1985, the con cluding session of the "Tercer Congreso Latinoamericano de Antropología" (Third Latin American Congress of Anthropology) took place at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Anthropologists from Latin America and Europe discussed for a week the topics of "social anthropology" and "rural and marginal com munities". They demanded that Latin American governments should recog nize and support the self détermination of native groups. Among the various resolutions aeeepted was a pétition presented by Elpidio Domínguez Castro, member of the Purépecha (Tarascan) Community in México, in which the Mexican Government was asked to respect the landholdings of this native group. Elpidio Domínguez, président of the Comisiariado de Bienes ~ Comunales Purépechas, declared that his people own 5.168 ha of land.

The little known part of the archaeological site of Cuicuilco which had heen unearthed white constructing the Olympic Village and adjacent training grounds for the Olympic Games of 1968 has meanwhile been opened to the general public. It can been visited by leaving the main pyramid and Walking to the other side of Avenida Insur gentes Sur. Tenayuca, D.F.: The local site muséum has been finished but cannot be opened to the public because of lack of staff. Jalapa, Veracruz: The anthropological muséum at Jalapa cannot be visited for an indefinite time, as the buildings have been broken down in order to construct a new muséum. The open air exhibition is closed, too. Cacaxtla, Tlaxcala. The famous murais of Cacaxtla, in particular the battle mural, which have deteriorated due to exposure to light and heat since the excavations in 1975-1978, are to be protected by a cupola spanning the whole complex. At the very beginning of the work - the making ofholes in which to set the roof posts - the workers came upon a new mural, located directly opposite the battle scene in a hitherto unexcavated part. For the moment work has been suspended. Monte Alban (Oaxaca): On November 1 1985 the muséum annex to the service building at Monte Alban was inaugurated. Built in the characteristic masonry style of Monte Alban III buildings, it contains chiefly stone monu ments from the archaeological area: danzantes, stelae and other reliefs from all periods, a few only excavated this year. In their original position, replicas made of glass-fiber and filled with earth have been placed instead. A total of about one hundred carved stones will be replaced by replicas in order to pro tect them from further climatic détérioration. Tuxtla Gutiérrez (Chiapas): The new Museo Regional de Chiapas, which opened its doors in September 1984, contains a hall of archaeological exhibi tions including some fine Olmec pieces, ceramics and objects from Chiapa de Corzo and polychrome vessels from the El Lagartero site. The hall dedicated to the cultural history of Chiapas has a section on contemporary ethnography. Villahermosa (Tabasco): The Museo Histórico de Tabasco, established in the Casa de los Azulejos from the end of the 19th Century, should be opened before the end of the year 1985. Campeche (Campeche): On September 10, 1985, the new Museo Regional was opened. It is set in a fine colonial building, tbe Casa del Teniente del Rey, which dates from the end of the 18th Century and is situated in the Calle Principal between the Puerta de Tierra and Puerta del Mar. The exhibits offer an overview of the archaeology and history of Campeche until well into the 20th Century (stelae, archaeological ceramics, a collection of arms, a town model showing Campeche in the 19th Century, etc.). Among the archaeological exhibits the contents of a classic Maya tomb from Calakmul with a jade mosaic mask (see mexicon VII: 100) are particularly impressive. A richly carved helm-beam of rosewood is the outstanding piece from the colonial period. Yucatán: Museos del Sitio (on-site muséums) have been erected in certain archaeological sites with a great deal of tourist traffic and are about to be opened: Uxmal: The Museum forms part of the new service building. It contains mainly sculptured architectural elements which had previously been kept in the local store, and some ceramics. Two stelae come from the stelae platform. Charts and written information complete the exhibition. Dzibilchaltun: The local muséum has been reconstructed. The exhibition stresses the ceramics, but contains also two stelae. Chichón Itzá: The muséum will be opened in the beginning of 1986. It will show sculptures and ceramics from the local store-house, accompanied by charts and written information. Yucatán: An Unpublished Fragment of a Column with Relief GRAZ (mex). The village of Ucú is situated about 10 km northwest of Mérida, capital of the Mexican Federal State of Yucatán, on the road that . connects Mérida with Hunucmá. In 1951, Raymond H. Thompson (Car negie Institution of Washington, Yearbook 50:234) reported the existence of a single arcbaeological mound near the village church of Ucú which documents a pre-hispanic seulement in this place. Edwin M. Shook discovered in the main square of Ucú the fragment of a column decorated with the relief of a standing person in frontal view. The limestone column is broken just above the knees of the figure and only the end of a loin cloth and the lower legs are preserved. The fragment testifies implicitly to the existence of a building with a doorway formed by two relief columns in Ucú,, an architectural detail found especially in the Puuc area of Yucatán and Campeche. Comparable columns with standing figures in bas-relief carved in a relatively simple style have been found in Yaxcopoil, Chilib and Maxcanú. The fragment is, up to now, the only piece of sculpture from Ucú and is desig nated provisionally as "Column 1". It is of interest in the architectural context because Ucú is situated outside the central area of the Puuc style and represents within the Maya lowlands one of the northemmost points of occurrence of this type of sculpture. Like ail other known doorway columns with bas-relief the monument from Ucu probahly belongs to the Late Classic period. In the archives of the Carnegie Institution of Washington located in the Pea body Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (Harvard University, Cam bridge, Mass.), three photographs taken in 1951 by Raymond Thompson are preserved. From one of these (C.I.W. Negative Number 51-20-61), Hillel Burger of Peabody Museum made a new photograph (N 30700), in which the monument is presented here for the first time.
