<plain_text><page sequence="1">WENNER-GREN RESEARCH CONFERENCE ON BANTU ORIGINS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, CHICAGO, MARCH 24-29, 1968 SUMMARY REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research supported a research conference on Bantu Origins in Sub-Saharan Africa, which was held from March 25 through 30, 1968, at the Center for Continuing Education, Uni- versity of Chicago. The participants in the meeting were J. Desmond Clark, University of California at Berkeley; David Dalby, School of Oriental and African Studies, London; J. M. J. de Wet, University of Illinois, Urbana; Christopher Ehret, Van Nuys, California; Brian M. Fagan, University of California at Santa Barbara; Geoffrey Gaherty, University of Toronto; Jack Harland, University of Illinois, Urbana; Thomas N. Huffman, University of Illinois; Charles M. Keller, University of Illinois, Urbana; Roland Oliver, School of Oriental and African Studies, London; Irvine Richardson, Michigan State University, East Lansing; Albert C. Spaulding, University of California at Santa Barbara; Jan Vansina, University of Wisconsin, Madison; Frank Willett, Northwestern Uni- versity; and C. C. Wrigley, University of Sussex. They were selected from a broad range of disciplines and spent five days in free-ranging discussions on Bantu origins and its related research problems. No formal papers were pre- sented, thereby leaving maximum time for discussion, nor is any publication resulting from the conference planned. This brief report summarizes some of the general conclusions of the meeting and sets out certain recommendations made by participants at the conference; a draft was circulated to all the delegates for examination prior to publication. The meeting began with a detailed presentation of the archaeological evidence for the origins of food production in Sub-Saharan Africa by Professor J. Desmond Clark. He showed that the climatic changes in the Sahara Desert were an important factor in the diffusion of ideas and processes of the new economies into West Africa and that sedentary settlement is not a criterion for domestication. The pastoral peoples of the Sudan and Sahara were affected by the gradual desiccation of the desert and slowly moved southward and eastward. Experiment, development, and adaptation of the African food plants were critical factors in the diffusion of agricultural techniques over most of Sub-Saharan Africa. The agronomists discussed sorghum and millet as well as Southeast Asian food plants and showed that important factors were ecological adaptations 225</page><page sequence="2">AFRICAN STUDIES BULLETIN for plant remains and the length of periods required for experimentation to achieve full domestication of plant species. They also stressed the important differences between Eastern and Western varieties of sorghum. A highlight of the conference was a presentation by Dr. David Dalby of Professor Malcolm Guthrie's linguistic evidence based on a comparative study of over 300 Bantu languages, including twenty-eight "test languages" studied in con- siderable depth. The evidence compiled by Guthrie over the last twenty-five years is now in the process of publication and the conference.was able to review an impressive body of information. From this information delegates concluded that there was an urgent need for the uniform training of comparative linguists and for the further extension of Guthrie's data, with a view to establishing pre- cisely the geographical distribution of important lexical items and the area covered by his Proto-Bantu "nucleus." On the physical anthropological side, Mr. Gaherty emphasized that there was a prevalence of typological thinking in African physical anthropology despite its rejection by most evolutionary biologists today. The interpretation of the biological history of the Bantu-speaking peoples has been made difficult by the perpetuation of typological concepts which have been rejected by the synthetic theory of evolution. The diversity shown by living and past populations can be more profitably viewed as naturally occurring variation within evolving, breeding populations than by postulating hybridization between hypothetical ancestral "types ." The historians gave a presentation of the historical background to later Bantu movements and settlement and discussed in detail the nature of the evidence and its limitations. They stressed the importance of trade and particularly of detailed studies of ethnographic data as a complement to both archaeological studies and the work of oral historians and linguists. The final sessions were taken up with a detailed review of research needs and with the formulation of recommendations for future research. Some of the main implications of the discussions can be summarized as follows: The archaeologists felt that their evidence, though as yet incomplete, suggests the strong possibility of the existence of dense populations in the more peripheral parts of the Congo Basin, and in the woodland savanna during "Later Stone Age" times. Some of these peoples had specialized economies oriented toward fishing and intensive collecting. Although the Bantu languages are by African standards closely related, the linguists present nevertheless postulated that the degree of differentiation existing between present-day Bantu languages could scarcely have come to pass within such a brief period as two millennia, the conventionally accepted chronological limit of the African "Iron Age." It was also pointed out that there was no remnant non-Bantu language in the north- west or central part of the present Bantu area which could be regarded as a pos- sible predecessor of Bantu. There was a wide feeling that the Proto-Bantu, namely the speakers of Guthrie's P.B.X. and of his subsequent Western and 226</page><page sequence="3">RESEARCH CONFERENCE ON BANTU ORIGINS Eastern dialects P.B.A. and P.B.B., were perhaps specialized "Later Stone Age" fishermen and "vegeculturalists" who were using, perhaps planting, such crops as yams and oil palms close to and in the southern fringes of the Congo forests. Possibly these people may have spread from there to the central part of the East African Coast at an early date. The banana and other southeast Asian food plants may have been introduced to this area before the "Iron Age," but there was a tendency among the agronomists to play down the importance of the Asian food crops. It was noted that, from physical anthropological, linguistic, and cultural evidence (such as matrilineal inheritance, anthropomorphic art, secret societies, and spirit possession cults), it was almost certain that the affinities of the Central Bantu were with the Negroes of the West African forest rather than with the Central Sudanic-speaking Negroes, the Nilotes, living immediately to the north of the present Bantu sphere. There was strong support for the notion that the main concentrations of non-Bantu-speaking populations had lived in the eastern and southern parts of sub-equatorial Africa, Kushites living to the northeast, while the Khoi-Khoi (Hottentot) speakers and the Bushman lived farther to the south. Assuming that language and race are closely related, the archaeological record has been in- terpreted as showing that all these populations go back to "Later Stone Age" times. Cattle were probably diffused into Sub-Saharan East Africa by Kushites and others during the first millennium B.C. or earlier. Although cereal agri- culture was known to the northern Kushites by 2000 B.C. at the latest, there is no evidence as yet to show that they brought crops southward into East Africa. Recent research suggests that Kushites in the Kenya Highlands were among the last people to adopt an "Iron Age" economy. Although the archaeological evidence is at present totally lacking, one may suspect that cereal agriculture was introduced into parts of East Africa and perhaps into much of the sub-continent by Central Sudanic-speaking peoples living between the Kushites in the east and the Bantu in the west. The sorghums and millets grown in most of Bantu Africa are the eastern varieties. It is prob- able that agriculture was first introduced into this area prior to the adoption of metallurgical techniques. As yet Stone Age cereal agriculturalists have not been identified in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, but detailed research in the northern Interlacustrine area might yield critical information on this point. Iron-working has been dated at Meroe to earlier than the fourth century B.C., while it is known to have flourished in West Africa at Nok as early as the fourth century B.C. Delegates suggested that a likely route by which iron- working may have spread first into West Africa was from the west, from where it was diffused southeastward into Bantu Africa. The latest research from South Central Africa indicates that metallurgy was well established in these areas by the fourth century A.D. Considerable numbers of settlements have been investi- gated in Zambia and Rhodesia but the area to the east and west of the Lualaba is 227</page><page sequence="4">AFRICAN STUDIES BULLETIN very little known. Advanced metallurgy was certainly flourishing in the Sanga area by the eighth and ninth centuries A.D., and it is therefore logical to expect that iron-working had been practiced in this region at least as early as in South Central Africa if not earlier. The arrival of iron-working and iron technology may not, therefore, have been responsible for the early settlement of Bantu-speaking peoples in the South- ern Woodlands, but the new technology may well have led to the expansion of the Bantu from there into Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa. The relationship of the Dimple-based and channelled pottery types of Eastern and Southern Africa has not been studied closely, for the evidence is still inadequate. But the former is distributed from Kalambo Falls in northern Zambia through Rwanda and Kivu as far north as the Nyanza Province of Kenya, while outlying sites are found near Mombasa and in northern Tanzania. Channelled pottery occurs throughout much of Zambia, widely in Rhodesia, and in at least one locality in South Africa. The earliest dates for both these pottery types have so far fallen in the first half of the first millennium A.D. Such readings are consistent with the rapid expansion of population centers already well established in the woodlands of the Southern Congo. The first settlement of the sub-continent by an immigrant group from the eastern parts of West Africa would probably have needed a more graduated time scale, and one with a different geographical distribution. The linking of ancient pottery traditions with modern ones, through the exca- vation of late medieval settlements known to traditional historians, was seen as one of the ways of determining how far the Dimple-based and channelled pottery traditions are likely to have been transmitted by rapidly expanding Bantu popu- lations. Another means of tracing the early expansion of the Bantu lay through the extension of the number of Guthrie's twenty-eight test languages to cover areas at present not represented in such detail. The evidence from traditional history tends to indicate that the Bantu- speaking world may have been centered initially on the Katanga or at least on the divide of the sub-continent. Oral evidence extends back as far as 600 years or so from the present in the most favorable areas. Even at the begin- ning of this time the population was dense enough to be an incentive for the development of small states over a region extending from the Interlacustrine region in the north to Katanga in the south as well as westward to the Congo mouth and southeastward to Rhodesia and Southern Mozambique. Traditional history confirms that some areas in the northeast sector of the present Bantu sphere have been Bantuized comparatively recently. The most serious gaps in our knowledge relate to the northwest region through which "Pre-Bantu" or remote ancestors of the present Bantu-speakers must almost certainly have passed. This does not seem to have been an area where there was an early or a rapid expansion of peoples speaking "true" Bantu languages. Professor Guthrie finds, however, that this area contains the Bantu languages with the lowest proportion of Common Bantu roots. In this case at least the sharply falling index of these roots must show something more than sheer distance from the nucleus of the Bantu languages. Neither archaeology 228</page><page sequence="5">RESEARCH CONFERENCE ON BANTU ORIGINS nor traditional history have yet contributed any significant data from this area, although the east end of this region, along the Ubangi and Uele Rivers, has yielded traditional records indicating a comparatively recent meeting and con- tact between Bantu and Central Sudanic peoples near the northern forest fringes. The most crucial of all areas for future investigation seemed to lie in the relations between the peoples living north and south of the Congo forests. Considerable argument circulated around the question as to how great a barrier the forest was for human settlement. Some regard it as a biotope which sharply contrasts with the forest margins. The forest environment rapidly modifies physical characteristics, but the populations with the largest stock of common physical characteristics are found all around the forest margins. The archae- ologists made the point that most of the forest is probably secondary rather than primary and that its present reduced state is due in large part to cutting and burning for cultivation. To Guthrie the forest has some special quality which may have accelerated the process of linguistic diversification, although in his scheme it appears as a one-way filter with a high index of Common Bantu roots to the south and a very low one to the north. This might indicate a late reflux of Bantu-speaking population from the center of the Bantu world into an area only lightly colonized by collateral descendants of the Pre-Bantu. Finally, there was general agreement that the spread of agriculture, the history of domestic animals, and the diffusion of iron tools and metallurgy are all separate problems which have to be considered separately from one another and from the history of Bantu languages. Only when more is known about each separate problem will it be possible to establish meaningful correlations between languages and cultures. Arising from their deliberations, the participants at the research con- ference made the following specific recommendations: (1) The discussions of the previous four days have indicated that there are a number of areas adjacent to, and surrounding, the equatorial forest regions which can be expected to yield archaeological data of vital importance to the study of Bantu origins. These areas of most crucial interest lie to the north and south of the Congo Basin, namely the forest mosaic, savanna, and grassland north of the Ubangi River in the Central African Republic and the savanna regions in the central Katanga, Guthrie's supposed nuclear area for the Bantu languages. These areas should be investigated by interdisciplinary teams collaborating in archae- ological programs. It is envisaged that the composition of such teams should include a botanist, an ecologist, an oral historian, a zoologist, a Bantu linguist, an ethnographer with archaeological training, and a physical anthropologist. The project must begin with an initial survey followed by the excavation of carefully selected "Late Stone Age" and early "Iron Age" sites. The excavations must be conducted in such a manner as to yield maximum information concerning eco- nomic and settlement patterns. The analyses and interpretation of information 229</page><page sequence="6">AFRICAN STUDIES BULLETIN recovered from these sites must utilize to the fullets possible degree the tech- niques of the disciplines involved and reflect close collaboration at all stages in the work. (2) It was recognized that in all the disciplines represented at this con- ference the regions lying immediately to the north and south of the Congo basin were at the same time the least well known and of the most crucial importance. Since research by foreigners in these areas present special difficulties, it was felt to be especially important that efforts should be made to encourage the training of African scholars from these areas. (3) The complexity of the study of Bantu origins makes it essential that there should be maximum collaboration between the relevant disciplines and institutions. This will need to be achieved through careful consultation and coordination in the planning of research, and through the regular exchange of staff and students. The association of certain disciplines with specific insti- tutions, such as the concentration of twenty-five full-time Africanist linguists at the London School of Oriental and African Studies, makes it desirable that such institutions should take the initiative in coordinating research and teaching within their own fields, and that they should bear special responsibility for the training of future research workers. Visiting studentships and professorships need to be established at such centers, on an international basis, in order that staff and students from foreign universities may have the opportunity of working at the relevant institution. This would, for example, enable British students of archaeology to work in the United States and American students of comparative linguistics to work in the United Kingdom; it would also facilitate interdisci- plinary training and exchange in such fields as ethnobotany and precolonial history. (4) It was recognized that research in traditional history is making a significant contribution to the study of the remoter African past. In the inter- pretation of archaeology and linguistic data it is of great importance to use the detailed evidence about the development of society and material culture during the past five or six hundred years. It was noted that the trend in research in traditional history is increasingly toward intensive work in particular linguistic communities and that, since in most of Africa those communities are small, research work must justify the heavy investment in linguistic training by working over a large chronological span in geographically limited areas. In all such studies scholarly presentation of the primary evidence is at least as important as the work of interpretation, and most research projects need to be conceived in terms of three or four years of research at dissertation level, including a substantial period spent in the field. (5) The conference welcomed the work of Professor Hiernaux on human variability and urged that further biological data be collected for populations of historical and linguistic importance, such as those speaking the test languages used by Professor Guthrie. There is a great need for the study of the osteology 230</page><page sequence="7">RESEARCH CONFERENCE ON BANTU ORIGINS of modern Africans, as exemplified by de Villiers' research on South African Negroes, in order to evaluate the biological affinities of prehistoric populations. There should be a reexamination of prehistoric skeletal remains from established archaeological sequences to determine whether there have been any marked changes in physical characteristics which might be associated with population movements and the expansion of new and more successful population groups at the expense of older ones. (6) There is a need to train ethnographers to specialize in those aspects of culture which are relevant to the archaeological and historical understanding of the African past: e.g., distribution studies, studies of patterns of settlement and of trade, the manufacture and use of artifacts, attitudes toward these and their nomenclature, and the technology of iron. (7) The most definitive evidence concerning the origin and evolution of cultivated plants may be expected from the field of archaeology. Critical botanical evidence is frequently ignored or of little use for lack of efficient means of positive identification. The field of "archaeobotany" is a much neglected discipline, deficient in professional personnel and specialized tech- niques. There is an urgent need for an archaeobotanical laboratory which can provide service to archaeologists in identification of plant remains and inter - pretation of the evidence. The laboratory should also develop new techniques and serve as a training center for archaeobotanists. Brian M. Fagan, Organizer Roland Oliver Tulli Grundeman, Rapporteuse 231</page></plain_text>
