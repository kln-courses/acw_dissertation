<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION more earnestly with this problem, as, for example, Brightman and Ber- dyaev have so brilliantly done; but no further solution is suggested here. Other chapters present critiques of humanism and naturalism as in- adequate to express the Christian faith, of the Bible as "containing" the Word of God, of the church as born of a "second primal creative act," of redemption and creation as implying each other, of the Holy Spirit as the guarantor of Christian truth, of election as the simple fact that some are reached by revelation and others not, and of the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection as "the supreme acquiescence" of our religion (not necessary to salvation, but part of the revealed truth). It is impossible to read this book without feeling the desperate religious earnestness that dominates it all, the greatness of its faith, and the depth of experience which under- lies it, but why the Christian religion should have to be presented so arbitrarily is difficult for this reviewer to understand. EDWARD T. RAMSDELL Vanderbilt University Theologie des Alten Testaments, Band III: Gott und Mensch. ByWALTHER EICHRODT. Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs Verlag, I939. i68 pages. Rm. 4.00. With this volume Eichrodt brings to completion his well-known study of the theology of ancient Israel. Beginning with an examination of con- cepts of individualism and collectivism, the volume moves on through personal relations to God (fear, faith, love, and the like), Old Testament ethics, sin and forgiveness (fittingly occupying nearly half the volume), and death and immortality. None may lightly discount the importance of Eichrodt's work. It con- tains much that is deserving of the highest commendation. One of its minor points of value is the insistence on the early recognition of individu- al rights along with the supposed supremacy of "group solidarity." More significant is Eichrodt's constant reference of all phases of Israel's religious thought to the vision of a God of greatness and supreme goodness. The work, too, is highly significant as indicating our emergence from the dominance of the "history of religions" approach to Israel's thinking. There is an Old Testament theology; and it is well to have this reaffirma- tion of the fact. Yet it is just at this point that the reader experiences his first stirring of uneasiness as to the treatment here given. While he has not been at all oblivious to the fact of a historic development in Israel's thought, yet it 324</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS is too largely true that Eichrodt has reached his conclusions by indiffer- ence to the very real gains of our long years of study of Israel's religion as a phase of the entire religious experience of the race. One may cite in illustration his claim that Israel's fear of God was quite different from the religious reverence of, say, Babylonia. An unprejudiced study of Baby- lonian psalms will reveal, on the contrary, that we can understand the higher attainments of Hebrew devotional thought only on the background of that of the Near East in general; and Israel's religion in every phase, far from being separated by an impassable gulf from that of her con- temporaries, was in the deepest sense the fruition and culmination of thousands of years of religious discovery in the Near East. But, further, Eichrodt is guilty of gross modernizing. One reads, for example, his account of Isaiah's faith with the growing realization that it is not history but dogma. In other words, Eichrodt has reversed the process that our entire historic exegesis has shown to be basic to a correct understanding of the Bible; instead of understanding Isaiah in his en- vironment and circumstances, he has fastened his own dogmas on certain of Isaiah's words. In this connection one's attention is attracted by the recurrence of certain words. What are we to deduce from such phrases as the following: "Die Gr6sse der unbegreifliche Gottes, die wunderbare Andersartigkeit seines Wesens," "das eigentiimliche Ineinander von Aktivitat und Passi- vitat," "der Dialektik des Glaubensverhaltnisses (in Bund und Gesetz)"? Obviously these ideas would seem even more strange to Old Testament thinkers than to us; and to postulate "Andersartigkeit" of a God who is thought of most characteristically in anthropomorphic terms, even in the relatively late period of a considerable part of the Psalter, is patently an absurdity. Yet still an "unbegreiflich Gott," and his "wunderbare An- dersartigkeit" do appear in the Old Testament. It is strange that Eich- rodt, while postulating these ideas where they are not, overlooks them when actually present. But the disturbing fact for his interpretation is that these are the views of Koheleth and Job's friends! The first was a cynic; and the latter were properly held up for contempt and criticism by the great poet of the dialogue, and by most interpreters since. W. A.
