CHAPMAN CAERPHILLY (1) Gelligaer, Green Hill Primary School (ST 13015 97070): six evaluation trenches, c. 150 m south of the Roman forts, produced no evidence to suggest that significant archaeological remains associated with the forts extended into the area. The features identified all appear to be post-medieval.1 CARMARTHENSHIRE (1) Llandeilo, North Heronry Dam , Dinefivr Park (SN 6082 2276): a total of eleven trenches were opened to look for evidence of a possible Roman building suggested by surface finds and geophysical survey. Strong evidence, in the form of brick and tile, for a substantial Roman building was discovered, but its exact location could not be pinpointed. A series of ditches and gullies indicated that this was an intensively used landscape in the Roman period, laid out with fields and tracks. Pottery from the excavation suggests use of the site in the second to fourth centuries, therefore demonstrating that the building was not associated with the nearby forts at Llandeilo, which had been abandoned by that time. The building, therefore, may have been a temple located close to a spring, or, more likely, a villa.2 (2) Llangadog, Llys Brychan Roman villa (SN 7048 2546): geophysical survey of the fields to the north of the villa revealed remains of not only part of the villa itself but also a series of ditches which formed a sub-rectangular enclosure of some 90 m by 80 m around it.3 Three trial trenches were excavated to sample the enclosure. One to the north revealed a V-shaped ditch containing two sherds of black burnished ware. A second trench, located to sample parallel double ditches of the enclosure to the south-west, revealed an outer V-shaped ditch containing a piece of abraded samian and an inner U-shaped ditch. The third trench was located to investigate two geophysical anomalies on the easternmost ditch. A large pit was excavated with a charcoal- rich fill, suggesting some form of industrial activity. Due to adverse weather conditions and lack of time this could not be fully investigated. The pottery suggests the mid/late third to the mid- fourth century as the period of occupation of the site.4 MONMOUTHSHIRE (1) Caerwent, Museum Cottage (ST 4686 9071): part of the hexagonally-shaped wall of a large Roman building, which had originally been excavated in the early twentieth century, was exposed during an archaeological evaluation.5 It was found that the structure had been seriously damaged by service trenches during the second half of the twentieth century.

Two linear features which were probably part of a drainage system were also thought to be Roman.6 (2) Monmouth: (a) Agincourt Square (SO 50765 12827): results of a watching-brief and mitigation excavation support the view that the area was inside the early Roman fort. The closely datable pottery in the assemblage recovered is consistently pre-Flavian and similar to the material from the fortress at Usk. Later Roman remains superseded this context, while a sterile post-Roman deposit sealed them from early Norman levels.7 (b) 33 Whitecross Street (SO 51040 12957): the main Roman deposit was dark loam which had survived on the western side of the site, lying directly over ancient alluvial sands. The Roman levels, which were in part associated with iron working, were sealed by a layer of fawn-coloured clay which also produced Roman pottery; this was sealed by medieval and later contexts.8 (3) Portskewett, Sudbrook Road (ST 4997 8805): excavation on a sloping site overlooking a former tidal inlet of the Severn Estuary, which was navigable into medieval times. The site was enclosed on the southern and eastern sides by an earth-and-rubble bank flanked by a ditch. The eastern ditch was at least 4 m wide and 1.5 m deep; that on the southern side was less substantial, presumably due to the steep slope. The ditches produced second- to fourth-century pottery. Within the enclosure there was another stone-revetted bank and further ditches, but no structures were found.9 (4) Undy, Meadow Bank House , Church Road (ST 43756 86840): stone foundations of a substantial Roman building were uncovered; finds included Roman pottery, coins and a well- preserved brooch.10 The coins are Philip I, silvered denarius A.D. 244-249, Constantine I, commemorative issue A.D. 330-346, Constantine I, A.D. 307-337. 11 NEATH, PORT TALBOT (1) Neath, Neath Port Talbot College, Dwr y Felin Road (SS 7485 9790): a watching-brief recorded a section of Roman road and associated roadside ditches. This supported the predicted location and alignment of the Roman road between the forts at Neath and Coelbren. Pottery retrieved from the road's primary make-up layer indicates a second-century construction date, which would be consistent with the second phase of occupation at the nearby fort. Two pits and a gully recorded 15 m east of the observed Roman road are associated with activity relating to the previously identified civilian settlement.12 NEWPORT (1) Caerleon (Isca): (a) 14 Goldcroft Common (ST 3371 9071): archaeological evaluation revealed wall foundations of barrack blocks at a depth of 0.45 m.

The second phase structure was of stone and was represented by a medieval robber trench cutting down to the water table. The final phase was represented by two walls built on rubble foundations.13 (b) Isca Road (ST 3445 9020-ST 3455 9006): a watching-brief produced some evidence for industrial and domestic activity belonging to the Roman period.14 (c) Fields to the south of the amphitheatre and Broadway Farm (ST 338 901): geophysical surveys (magnetometry) of the fields between the amphitheatre and the flood plain of the River Usk, extending south-west of the field surveyed in 2008. 15 The results revealed a series of very large masonry buildings on the 'oblique' alignment, around two sides of an area apparently free of archaeological features. Extending backwards from the façade of the building excavated by Nash-Williams in 1955 ('Building XI')16 are at least two large square courtyards, enclosed by porticos or ranges of rooms leading towards the river's edge.17 (2) Langstone, Celtic Manor Coach Park (ST 376 922): evidence for the route of the Roman road linking Usk to Caerleon on the left bank of the River Usk, between ST 37583 92267 and ST 37679 92314, on the lower slopes of the Wentwood ridge and on the southern side of the river, was revealed. A secondary track, also probably of Roman origin, ran broadly parallel to the main road and appeared to serve a small, 3 m internally, single-celled, nearly square building at ST 37660 92277. The building was set back 20 m uphill from and overlooking the Roman road; the entrance was in the north elevation facing the Roman road.18 POWYS (1) Cil-Gwrgan (SO 1470 9333): a watching-brief produced further evidence for the course of the Forden Gaer to Caersws Roman road (RR64).19 A layer of stone beneath the base of the modern road (A483) appeared to have been laid on top of a deposit of imported clay.20 (2) Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain (SJ 2280 2062): a watching-brief identified a trackway consisting of compacted gravel containing nineteenth-century pottery. The track is depicted on the Ordnance Survey first edition map of 1886 (Montgomeryshire 10.7); its course appears to coincide almost exactly with the northern side of the putative Roman supply depot,21 and is therefore likely to be the feature which was identified from aerial photographs and interpreted as part of the defensive circuit.22 (3) Newtown, site of the old Smithfield (SO 1145 9147): excavations revealed a significant length of the Forden Gaer to Caersws Roman road (RR64). In total an area of around 3,115 m2 was mechanically stripped, in three areas, uncovering around 210 m of the Roman road. Three 13 Work by S. Clarke and J. Bray for Monmouth Archaeology. Mr S.

The earliest phase had been constructed on a base of imported clay, with a road width of around 4.5 m. It had a single ditch on the south-eastern side. A second layer of metalling was later laid directly onto the surface of the first, and the roadside ditch was reçut, to form a wider and deeper feature. A number of wheel-ruts were identified in the compacted surface, while a coin was recovered from the make-up, suggesting that this phase was constructed in the early second century. The final phase saw a widening of the road to around 6 m, extending across the flanking ditch. While there was some evidence for roadside activity, in the form of stone spreads and limited areas of burning, it seems likely that a broad strip on either side of the road remained relatively sterile throughout its use, a feature also noted along other Roman roads. Although at least one stone surface is likely to be contemporary with the first phase of road construction, there was a general lack of stratigraphical or artefactual evidence to relate other features to the Roman road.23 (4) Penstrowed (SO 0720 9083): a watching-brief and small-scale excavation identified a short section of the Forden Gaer to Caersws Roman road (RR64) in a field on the eastern side of the A490. In all 28 m of road were identified within the stripped area, following an alignment of 332 degrees. To the south of the excavation the road was less well preserved and a machine-excavated sondage some 35 m from the excavation failed to identify any surviving road structure. It was evident that the road had been severely truncated, but there was evidence for two phases of road construction. The earliest phase consisted of a deposit of compacted river gravel around 0.1m thick laid directly onto the clay subsoil, with a layer of larger river cobbles, up to 0.15 m in size, above, forming the base for a road around 4.5 m wide, with no surviving surface. Along the eastern side of the road there was evidence for a second phase of road construction in the form of a thin layer of compacted river gravel which had been largely truncated by ploughing, surviving only where it dipped along the edge of the original road. A layer of silty clay separated the two phases. A shallow roadside ditch was identified along the western side, 0.9 m wide and 0.3 m deep. The corresponding ditch on the eastern side was not identified within the excavated area.24 (5) Walton, Four Stones (SO 2468 6065): excavations revealed several features of Roman date, lying around 1 km west of Hindwell auxiliary fort. The main feature was a short length of ditch, which contained a significant quantity of Roman pottery dating to the late third to fourth century, as well as a fragment of a rotary quern. The ditch, which was aligned north-south, was around 1.1m wide and up to 0.6 m deep, and was butt-ended at its southern terminus. The profile was generally V-shaped, with a noticeable slot 0.25 m wide in its base, which became more pronounced further from the butt-end. There was a suggestion that the ditch may have turned to the east at the point at which it intersected with the eastern edge of the excavation. A second, shallower Roman ditch was identified further to the south, which was V-shaped, and c. 0.9 m wide and 0.35 m deep. Pottery recovered from the fill included a Severn Valley ware tankard and sherds of black burnished ware.25 VALE OF GLAMORGAN (1) Llanmaes, Tremains Farm (SS 984 688): geophysical survey revealed a series of fields or enclosures in the northern half of the site, which could be part of a much more extensive 23 Work by Clwyd Powys Archaeological Trust, in advance of a supermarket development.

A sample taken from ditch 14104, however, contained plant remains that suggest an Iron Age or Roman date for the feature. At present this dating remains tentative.27 (2) St Äthan: (a) Batslays Farm (ST 003 679): dating evidence provided by the excavated features suggests that the complex of geophysical anomalies found in the south-west corner of the site represents a Romano-British agricultural settlement. A trackway and rectilinear enclosure or field boundaries lie to the east and north-east of the settlement, with the limited evidence suggesting they too date to the Roman period. Pottery recovered from this settlement suggests that it was in use from the second to fourth centuries.28 (b) MoD St Äthan (ST 002 686): evaluation work revealed a large number of features, both linear and discrete. None could be dated from artefact assemblages, but samples taken from gully 16604 and post-hole 16606 contained plant remains consistent with an Iron Age or Roman date. It is possible that the features on this site are related to or contemporaneous with the Iron Age and Romano-British settlement excavated on the site of the Red Dragon Hangar some 500 m to the north-east,29 or the Batslays Farm settlement, reported above, c. 550 m to the south-east.30 2.

A previously unknown structure was revealed between the two north-western granaries, while a substantial magnetic anomaly in the south-east corner of the fabrica may be a further iron hoard; this building also shows magnetically-enhanced activity in its northern range. An oval feature c. 80 m long37 lies outside the east gate; the barrow cemetery to the north is more extensive than now visible. West of the fortress, a series of pits was revealed. To the south-east, results confirmed aerial indications that activity extended beyond the known temporary camp up to the fortress defences; field-walking recovered quantities of Roman finds and extensive traces of lead-working, suggesting an external settlement and perhaps an industrial zone, (b) Garden Cottage, Delvine Gardens (NO 1286 3945): evaluation38 of a development site immediately east of the fortress and south of the Redoubt, adjacent to the road line, found no surviving trace of Roman remains. (2) Standingfauld (NN 866 134): aerial survey39 located quarry pits of the Gask road c . 200 m east of the Ordnance Survey line. (3) Shielhill North (NN 8559 1216): excavation40 to the south-west of Shielhill North watch- tower, where the Roman road branches, showed that both routes were in excellent condition, though no dating evidence was recovered. The branch line was less well-built, comprising a relatively loose layer of fist-sized stones; it followed easier gradients, with slight cuttings and embankments across the stream valley to the east. (4) Forteviot (NO 0537 1739): unstratified sherds of Roman pottery were found during excavation41 of a Pictish cemetery and adjacent enigmatic square enclosure; features within the enclosure suggest a role in funerary rites.42 FALKIRK (1) Lochlands (NS 8561 8171): excavation43 in the north-west of the largest camp revealed the corner of a smaller, previously unknown, earlier camp (fig. 3).

(2) Croy Hill (NS 731 766): detailed topographic survey of a 2 km stretch of the Wall and associated remains was undertaken around Croy Hill.46 New discoveries were all post-Roman. EAST DUNBARTONSHIRE (1) Kirkintilloch, St Flannan's church (NS 663 742): a series of small watching-briefs47 immediately south of the Wall line found no certain Roman remains. A deposit exposed in one trench may represent the upper fill of the Ditch at NS 66255 74315, to the south of the Ordnance Survey line but consistent with previous work;48 too little was exposed to confirm the identification. (2) Bearsden, 16 Roman Road (NS 5463 7203): an evaluation49 within the fort's annexe showed that archaeological deposits survived only in the west and south of the area.50 SOUTH OF THE ANTONINE WALL FALKIRK (1) Carriden: (a) (NT 021 810): three further north-south magnetometer transects,51 160-200 m long, to the west of the fort and east of Carriden Brae Road, found no continuation of the Wall or Ditch, (b) (NT 024 807): sections dug52 across an enclosure south of the fort53 revealed a two- phase ditch (fig. 4). The substantial inner ditch probably defended a southern annexe enclosing the bath-house;54 a cobbled rampart base survived in places. It was overlain at its north end by a road, and cut in places by the later, smaller ditch; the latter is possibly a water channel, cut into clay and acting as an aqueduct for the fort. There are traces of a road running approximately north-south, just outside (east of) the ditches, approaching the south gate, while cobbling and other features beyond the ditches indicate extramural activity. The recent fieldwork and scrutiny of aerial survey and geophysical evidence have suggested a re-interpretation of the site's layout,55 with the fort sitting at the west edge of the plateau, overlooking the burn, and annexes to east and south (fig. 5). 45 For O Hotels by M.

The gateway was confirmed as an eight-post structure, with a slot along the rear of the southern edge to limit access. A substantial east-west ditch complex at the northern end, representing three converging ditches (one notably broad and flat),67 suggests that the northern annexe defences were more complex than realised; they merged with the north-south annexe ditch, but no relationship could be discerned. Further evidence of subdivision in the annexe came from a previously unknown north-south ditch at the southern limit of excavation, its extent unknown. An as of Trajan from the upper fill of the southern funnel ditch pushes the post-occupation use of the site (argued to represent a collection centre for animals) later than suspected. Notable among a thin scatter of internal features were possible remains of a building and adjacent well, although the latter was only partly excavated.

HADRIAN'S WALL By PETE WILSON SOUTH TYNESIDE (1) South Shields fort ( Arbeia ) (NZ 365 679): following completion of excavation inside the east quadrant of the fort last year, a new trench 150 sq m in area was opened 15 m south-west of the southern angle of the fort in order to assess the preservation of the ditch system and vicus. Beneath 1.5 m of overburden (consisting mainly of ship ballast), plough-damaged Roman stone structures were encountered at a distance of 30 m from the south-western fort wall, running on the same south-west to north-east alignment as the fort. These buildings will be further explored in 20 10.82 NEWCASTLE (1) Ben well, Trinity School (Oakfield College Site), Condercum Road (NZ 2180 6449): an area covering c. 830 m2 was excavated on the northern valley side of the River Tyne, following up an evaluation earlier in the year which identified likely Roman period remains. The site lies within 150 m to the south-east of the Hadrian's Wall fort of Condercum. The main Roman period features recorded in the excavation were a sunken metalled trackway running downslope and a substantial ditch - up to c. 2 m wide and up to 1.2 m deep - probably representing the south- eastern right-angled corner of an enclosure laid out during the second century A.D. but evidently re-established, slightly further west, during the second to third century. Within the enclosure a possible timber slot, a possible infant burial, and a shallow pit were recorded. In sum, these remains potentially represent the south-easternmost extent of the vicus of CondercumP 77 S.S. Frere and J.K. St Joseph, Roman Britain from the Air (1983), 123-6; J.K.

Deeply stratified Roman period remains were recorded, for the most part dating to the first half of the third century. The walls of a substantial sandstone structure were recorded, possibly an element of the Roman fort Pons Aelius , along with a portion of a road and other remains likely representing extramural activity in the vicus settlement to the west of the fort.84 (3) Walker, Fossway (NZ 2857 6541): an evaluation in 2008 in advance of service renewal found the clay and rubble core of Hadrian's Wall in the grass verge between the road and the footpath on the south side of the Fossway, immediately west of its junction with Whinneyfield Road. No facing stones were observed. 85 NORTHUMBERLAND (1) Vindolanda (NY 768 663): (a) excavations86 within the fort (fig. 7) concentrated on exploring the nature and significance of the fourth-century and post-Roman occupation in the north-west quadrant. Between the granaries and the northern and western fort walls 22 buildings were examined. Most appear to have been built directly over the demolished remains of earlier third-century barrack blocks or workshops. The fourth-century structures appear to have been used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from accommodation to workshops, store-rooms (including enclosed yards), and to three buildings which may have served social fonctions. There was very little to suggest that this area contained 'chalet type' barrack blocks as found elsewhere in the fort,87 although by keeping the earlier road network intact, the fourth-century builders constrained their structures to within the boundaries laid down by perhaps more traditional third- century plans. The buildings on the northern and southern limits - a temple to Dolichenus against the northern rampart mound and a possible schola across the road from the granaries - had been furnished with heated rooms, perhaps indicative of their higher status. A third building, which was situated on the rampart mound adjacent to the west gate, was the only one to produce painted wall-plaster, of the highest quality so far recovered from any third- or fourth-century building on the site. It is possible that this may also have been a shrine, situated like the temple to Jupiter Dolichenus near a gateway, but if this was the case the deity remains unknown. The excavation of this building will be completed in 2010. The temple to Jupiter Dolichenus on the northern rampart, to the west of the north gateway, produced three altars, all of which were probably of third-century date. At present it is impossible to be certain if the worship of the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus thrived at Vindolanda into the fourth century, but it would appear from the coins and other datable artefacts recovered that the temple precinct was respected well into the middle of the fourth century, before it was thoroughly demolished. After demolition the remains of the building were heavily burned before the site was completely abandoned. Almost all of the late Roman levels in the north-western quadrant were capped by debris from subsequent occupation (the Dolichenum aside), which, although sometimes fragmentary in nature, extended across a wide area. In most cases the remains of post-Roman buildings were only traceable through surviving roughly-paved platforms, wall foundations and the occasional post-pit or sunken feature. The post-Roman occupation levels were almost completely void of any trace of associated material culture. 84 Excavation by A. Goode, Pre-Construct Archaeology Limited, for C.

There were traces of a timber structure of mid-second-century date containing silver birch upright posts, with oak boarded panels. Overlying the timber structure, a stone-built gateway was found, with associated defensive features including a rampart revetment and ditch. The gate had been a single portal, 2.65 m wide with only one course of masonry surviving above its foundations, constructed of coursed rubble bonded with clay, but its quoins were more finely dressed. Both door pivot holes had survived relatively unworn and measured 100 mm in diameter. A cobbled roadway exited from the gate towards the west, flanked on either side by shallow drains, with a further drain running through the centre of the gate portal. The roadway had been resurfaced at least once, at which point the central drain had been covered. The rampart revetment consisted of a single line of rubble blocks and was traced for 14.26 m to the south of the gateway. A linear band of clay, likely to have been the remains of the rampart itself, was attached to its east side and was 2 m wide. These features appear to represent the remains of a gated enclosure, or annexe, attached to the western side of Stone Fort 1. By the turn of the third century the defences had been abandoned, or demolished, and ditches were cut through the area as defences for the south-west corner of the Seveřan establishment. A section was excavated through the main, inner, ditch, and traces were also found of a second, outer, ditch, measuring 2.10 m wide and 870 mm deep. It had filled up naturally with sand and silts before being capped with clay. Evidence for the third-century vicus was relatively slight. A major cobbled roadway, 12.5 m wide, leading north-west from the industrial workshops identified in 2008, was traced for a distance of 30 m. However, severe disturbance to the uppermost Roman soil surfaces by post- Roman agricultural activities meant no associated structures could be identified. The coinage and ceramic evidence recovered suggested little or no activity (c) 2009 saw the start of a series of smaller scale excavations to the north of the modern line of the Stanegate road which are being instigated to check the extent and the nature of the archaeology of that area in the light of an earlier magnetometer survey. Two superimposed Roman buildings were discovered as well as drainage features and indicators of industrial metal working. The largest of the buildings, 12.0 by 21.0 m, dating from the third century, appears to have been an aisled barn or storage facility set at the edge of the extramural settlement. Due to extensive damage from post-medieval ploughing and field drainage work, very little of the floor surfaces remained intact and few artefacts were recovered. Further work in this area is planned for the summer of 2010. CUMBRIA (1) Birdoswald {Banna) (NY 619 660): continuing erosion of the river cliff upon which the cemetery is located led to the excavation of a broad area on the cliff edge in order to recover archaeological deposits under short- and medium-term threat. A cobbled road was found leading up from the fort and civilian settlement. On the side of this road was a ditched enclosure, within which were cremation burials and commemorative deposits dating from the second to fourth centuries. It was apparent that a great deal of the enclosure had already been lost to erosion. A range of rites was present, including the burial of cremated remains in simple pits, stone-lined cists, wooden boxes and pottery vessels; there were also two examples of busta. Grave goods included pottery vessels, a fused-glass vessel and iron nails. In one of the pots containing cremated bone were several copper-alloy annular objects, and a fragment of chain mail. The entrance to the enclosure was blocked by two inhumation burials laid end-to-end. Dating evidence suggests 88 Under the direction of J. Blake.

Brocavum ) (NY 53812 28593-54466 28900): an excavation along the proposed route of a pipeline to the south-east of the fort at Brougham was implemented following the discovery of in-situ Roman remains during an evaluation of the easement. The earliest remains to be excavated included a substantial metalled surface, aligned north-south and probably forming part of a main road close to the south-east corner of the fort. The remains of at least three buildings, also belonging to an initial phase of Roman activity, were revealed fronting onto the road at a distance of approximately 100 m from the south gate of the fort. The footprint of each building was marked by a series of shallow foundation trenches for timber sill beams, with spreads of compacted clay representing internal flooring. The foundations of the earliest buildings were sealed beneath a second metalled surface that was laid perpendicular to the main road, denoting an expansion of the Roman settlement. The stone foundations of three large buildings were exposed at the junction of the newly laid surface and the main road (fig. 8). The fragmentary remains of stone flooring and hearths were identified within the footprint of the buildings, whilst the presence of several sandstone tiles in overlying deposits indicated that at least one had had a stone roof. The vestiges of several cremation burials were identified some 440 m to the east of the excavated buildings, probably signifying the eastern fringe of the Roman cemetery that was excavated in 1966-7.91 Numerous U-shaped ditches that were revealed between the excavated buildings and the cremation burials may have represented elements of a field-system. Within one area, a series of eight ditches was exposed, creating well-defined, sub-rectangular plots, each measuring 10 m by 5 m. Preliminary examination of the material assemblage has provided dates ranging from the early second to the fourth centuries, with the majority of artefacts being of late second- and third-century provenance. The assemblage incorporates numerous fragments of jewellery, including a Whitby jet pendant and ring, and a gold-in-glass bead dated to c.

The uppermost surface of the intervallum road was revealed along with the outer end of a long, narrow masonry building - seemingly a barrack - aligned per strigas. In its final guise this was c. 7.40 m wide, though there are signs that the building was about 11.5 m wide in the preceding phase, extending further to the south- east. Traces of internal partition walls suggest the layout of the interior space was modified on several occasions. One area of the interior was equipped with a floor of heavy stone flags that includes several pieces of re-used architectural stonework. A number of post-settings suggest one or more later structures of timber, though these are undated. (2) Bowes ( Lavatris ), Bowes Manor (NY 9904 1304): an archaeological evaluation was conducted in response to a proposed residential development.95 The site in question lies some 70 m outside the east wall of the fort and immediately north of the assumed line of the road leading to the east gate. It also lies west and south-west of Holme Lea where a previous evaluation was carried out in 2008. 96 Two trenches were excavated and in one of these a spread of heavy cobbles was encountered, assumed to represent the road leading to the east gate of the fort. The second trench revealed the walls of a masonry building of probable third-century date overlying a considerable build-up of deposits presumably derived from earlier structures. Associated pottery ranged in date from the late first to the early fourth century. (3) Chester le Street ( Concangis ), Auckland Cottage (NZ 2752 5124): excavations were conducted in the grounds of Auckland Cottage, situated mid-way between Middle Chare and High Chare and immediately south of the assumed line of the south wall of the fort. Elements of the west and north walls of a stone building with a flagged floor were revealed. A 4 m-wide street lay immediately to the west and traces of another of similar width was found to the south giving the flagged chamber a maximum north-south dimension of c. 11 m. There was no sign of the fort ditch. The building just described had been erected in the mid to late third century and overlay the infilling of an earlier cut- feature at least 4 m wide and at least 1.5 m deep running north-south. The latter aligns with and is similar in profile to the ditch of the western defences of the primary fort encountered near the north-west corner of the fort during the 1991 Church Chare excavation and is interpreted as a continuation of such.97 A barrack block of the late third-century fort had subsequently been erected over this ditch. The characteristics of the building and streets found at Auckland Cottage and the absence of any sign of the anticipated south ditch of the later fort suggest these features were intramural and thus that both the primary and secondary forts extended further south than previously thought. Topographical factors suggest the southern limit of the fort lay c. 25 m out from the line conjectured earlier, the streets found at Auckland Cottage forming the south-west angle of the via sagularis and the structure the south end of a barrack 94 The project is a partnership involving: Durham County Council's Archaeology Section; the Department of Archaeology (including Archaeological Services), Durham University; the School of Archaeology, Department of Classics, Stanford University; and the Architectural and Archaeological Society of Durham and Northumberland.

This would give the later fort an overall length of c. 190 m, thus increasing its size from the previous estimate of 2.5 ha (6.17 acres) to 3.04 ha (7.52 acres).98 (4) Lanchester ( Longovicium ) (NZ 1596 4706): further geophysical survey was carried out in the vicus, both extending the area surveyed in 2008 along Dere Street north-west of the fort and also along Dere Street south-east of the fort for a distance of c. 250 m (fig. 9)." The north-west area, on the far side of a stream and area of boggy ground, was devoid of buildings and appears to mark the limit of the built-up area in this direction. To the south-east, both sides of Dere Street were lined with typical civilian strip-buildings for a distance of c. 250 m out from the south- east angle of the fort. An arrangement of ditches can be seen defining plots behind the buildings with a back lane at the rear of those to the east of Dere Street. Roughly opposite the fort gate and some distance back from the east side of Dere Street there appears to be a double-ditched enclosure measuring c. 40 m across. It seems out of character with the rest of the settlement and may pre-date or post-date the vicus. (5) Sedgefìeld, East Park (NZ 3505 2894): the remainder of the open area between Sedgefield, the Al 77 and the A689 was subjected to geophysical survey to recover further details of the settlement investigated during the summers of 2005-8 (fig. 10). 100 The system of enclosures continued along both sides of the Roman road (often referred to as Cade's Road) as far as, and probably beyond, the boundaries of the available area. The minimum size of the settlement is now estimated at 30 ha. DARLINGTON (1) Piercebridge (NZ 2103 1575): geophysical survey and evaluation excavation as part of a Time Team investigation produced the following results, (i) Several buildings were sampled in the area west of the north-west corner of the late fort. These were on a different alignment to the latter and appear to belong to the second/third-century civil settlement that preceded it which thus extended over a far wider area than previously thought.101 (ii) Geophysical survey in Tofts Field east of the fort revealed a series of parallel ditches following a north-west/south-east alignment and continuing to the bank of the Tees close to the site of the early bridge. Excavation of one of these features showed that it was in fact a sunken way, equipped with a cobble surface and masonry revetting walls, leading down to the river and presumably a ford alongside the bridge, (iii) Samples were taken for radiocarbon dating from timber piles belonging to the original Dere Street bridge, (iv) Samples taken from another timber structure situated c. 150 m further upstream, possibly belonging to the remains of yet another bridge or crossing, yielded 14C dates of 15-75 cal.

The objective is to allow the study of the architectural as well as spatial planning of the town and perhaps track its development over time. The season's survey covered three areas located on or outside the walls, as well as in the centre of the town around the excavated mosaics. The results of these surveys were very successful in identifying parts of the street system, houses, defences and previously unknown extramural settlement areas. Outside the south gate, a series of buildings were identified running parallel with the ditch systems of the defences. Within the town, around the preserved mosaics, the full complexity of the town was revealed, showing streets, buildings and rooms. An area of geophysics was also carried out over an area of the wall between the north and west gates. This area had in part been examined previously; trenches were excavated over the wall in the 1930s,103 and more recently, a small area of resistance survey was carried out in the 1980s.104 The project also aims to draw together previous work on the site. 105 (2) Aiskew: (a) Aiskew Grange Farm (SE 272 899): an evaluation was carried out along the line of the proposed Bedale, Aiskew and Leeming Bar bypass. Geophysical survey detected an intense rectilinear anomaly on fields west of Aiskew Grange Farm. Subsequent trial trenching sampled this and exposed one corner of the robbed-out foundation of a building beneath a demolition deposit consisting of mortared building stone, together with fragments of Roman roof- and hypocaust-tile. The presence of Roman artefacts within the robber trench, in the demolition deposit and in surrounding features indicates that the building is of Roman date. A major ditch containing a particularly large finds assemblage was present in a trench 40 m to the south of the building; the assemblage included fine wares of second- to third-century date. Several other pits, ditches and post-holes, also containing Roman artefacts, were detected in this trench and in another one 90 m to the south of the building. The rectilinear shape of the geophysical anomaly, nature of the demolition rubble, and the high status nature of the finds assemblage are all consistent with the building having been a villa. 106 (b) Aiskew Bank Farm (SE 267 890): an enclosure located 0.9 km to the south-west of the villa building and previously known from aerial photographs, was also sampled during the evaluation. This produced hand-made Romano-British pottery, a large animal bone assemblage, and evidence for metalworking. The bone assemblage showed marked differences to that from the villa.107 (3) Drax: 88 copper-alloy radiates - Central Empire from Gallus and Volusian to Claudius II and Gallic Empire from Postumus to Tetricus I and II.108 (4) Filey area: 21 silver siliquae (12 clipped) from Constantius II and Julian Caesar to Arcadius and Honorius.109 103 See J.N.L.

Deeper obstructions encountered within pile holes may be parts of Roman stone structures.110 (b) Sewerage attenuation tanks, 28-40 Blossom Street (SE 5963 5137): excavation of a 9.4 m by 6.2 m trench revealed a late first/early second-century soil sealed by sustained periods of dumping and levelling into the mid/late third century. These deposits contained redeposited material indicative of nearby funerary and industrial activities. Several phases of boundary ditches, pits and an early second-century cobbled lane were interspersed between these levelling deposits. The very disturbed remains of a mid-fourth-century post-built structure were cut into the built-up ground, and were in turn sealed by further levelling deposits containing much residual Roman pottery. Roman activity was sealed beneath a medieval ploughsoil which contained a large amount of Roman material, indicating significant disturbance of the Roman deposits below.111 (c) Dutch House, 4 Ogleforth (SE 6050 5222): a watching-brief noted several backfill deposits on the alignment of the Roman legionary fortress. These may have been backfilled beam-slots belonging to timber buildings of the early Roman period, probably late first century to early second century a.D. A small area of well-burnt clay, possibly representing a hearth, was observed in section.112 (d) 3 Driffield Terrace (SE 5931 5100): a watching-brief on the site of the discovery in 2004/5 of 75 Roman inhumations, of which 53 had been decapitated.113 The 2009 works included an area not accessible during the original excavation but known to contain further burials. An additional three inhumations were identified and lifted. Two were crouched burials and the third was supine and had been decapitated, with the skull placed by the left knee. These burials have been included in the on-going osteoarchaeological analysis of the Driffield Terrace assemblage.114 (e) Heslington East (SE 641 509): following the 2008 excavation of a third- to fourth- century Roman masonry building and a substantial rectangular cobbled foundation,115 the 2009 excavations at the site set those features within their immediate landscape context. When the building was constructed, the whole of the landscape in its vicinity was modified by terracing, ignoring the small amount of prehistoric occupation of the area. Features include a significant north-south boundary ditch, a series of east-west linear features, including ditches and a cobbled 'trackway', and an organic waterlogged deposit on the spring-line to the south. Above the building, towards the top of the hillslope, two adjacent Roman burials, of an adult male and female, were discovered cut into a ditch and aligned north-south.116 (2) York area: (a) 1 AR denarius (Severus Alexander), 1 AE sestertius (Commodus) and 1,437 BI radiates (Valerian I/Gallienus to Tetricus I/Tetricus II), deposited c. a.D. 274. 117 (b) 1 AR denarius (Trajan) and 545 BI radiates (Tetricus I/Tetricus II).118 110 Work on behalf of Moorside Developments by D.

An evaluation undertaken in 2004 had demonstrated the presence of Roman archaeology at the site. In 2009 a shallow gully or beam-slot containing early second-century ceramics was recorded cut into the clay subsoil - the feature may be contemporary with Fort II, but have gone out of use by Phase III.122 Once disused the feature was cut by a subsequent ditch containing an assemblage of daub and abraded, likely residual, second-century ceramics. The ditch was fairly wide, stepped, and oriented north-south and may be broadly aligned with the Phase IV ditch system defining post-military settlement. Both features can be related to the results of the 2004 evaluation and also to the broader discoveries of the 1970s and 80s.123 LANCASHIRE (1) Kirkham, 46 St Michaels Road (SD 43276 32017): during the course of a watching-brief of groundworks for a residential extension, part of a substantial Roman stone- and brick-built structure furnished with an under-floor heating system was uncovered positioned to the north- east of the Hadrianic/ Antonine fort. The structure was circular or apsidal, and it appears that only part of the south-west wall was observed, together with part of the interior. However, if the curve of the inner wall is projected northwards, it is possible to estimate that the structure may have had an internal diameter (or a north-south dimension, depending on whether it was a circular or apsidal feature) of c. 2.9-3 m. Within the structure, four pilae, and fragments of a possible fifth, were seen. The tiles had been robbed to their basal course, indicated by an overlying deposit relating to a phase of disuse or alteration of the structure, in turn overlain by a deposit of apparently deliberately laid cobbles and sandstone rubble respecting the position of the wall of the structure. This may have been a crude internal surface laid after the heating- system had been dismantled, but before the structure itself was demolished. A complex series of features and deposits was also recorded, with potentially one of the earliest features being a ditch or trench at least 1.25 m wide, but it is not thought to have been associated with the circular or apsidal structure. Four wooden posts and stakes were found within the trench and a fifth lay immediately outside its southern edge, possibly the remains of a timber structure. Further south, a well-laid surface of water-worn cobbles, pebbles and sandstone fragments was revealed, with two wooden posts or stakes seemingly associated. Two larger posts, possibly part of a north-east/ 119 Found by Messrs D. Watson and D. Barwise while searching with metal-detectors. BM Ref.: 2008 T705. R. Abdy sent information. 120 Found by Mr D .

The character of the remains leaves little doubt that they represent one or more structures, together with seemingly associated external deposits, although it is likely that there was more than a single phase of occupation. The building is of considerable importance, although too little was seen for its function to be established precisely. The available evidence, however, suggests that it may have been a bath- house, particularly given the building's position adjacent to the Carr Brook. Dating evidence from the site is virtually non-existent, but logic suggests it would have been associated with the fort.124 (2) Morecambe Bay, north of Carnforth: 50 copper-alloy radiates - Victorinus to Allectus.125 LINCOLNSHIRE (1) Great Packington: 1 silver denarius of Tiberius (mint of Lyon) deposited c. a.D. 37. 126 (2) Lincoln (Lindum): (a) Lincoln Castle (SK 9739 7175): an evaluation, consisting of four trenches and a borehole survey, was undertaken to inform proposals for the construction of a Heritage Skills building. Roman ceramics were recovered from all interventions and were accompanied in some instances by Roman ceramic building material and painted wall-plaster. The ceramic assemblages represent the earliest to latest Roman occupation in the city. The presence of painted wall-plaster in deposits adjacent to and contemporary with the Crown Wing is of note, since a Roman building with mosaic floor (and presumably painted wall-plaster) was destroyed during its construction. In addition, among the residual Roman ceramics two sherds were noteworthy, a flagon sherd with graffito and a segmented bowl not yet paralleled in the corpus of Roman ceramics from the city. The incidence of graffiti on ceramic has been noted as higher in areas of dense population such as fortress or urban sites where common ceramic forms needed marks of ownership.127 (b) Wickham Gardens (SK 9749 7211): evaluation revealed the top of the Roman city rampart to the rear of the city wall on its northern side. There were rough north-south stone walls on top of the rampart bank, as previously found by Graham Webster at nearby North Row in 1946. 128 Pottery from rampart deposits ranged from the second to the fourth centuries.129 (c) 9-11 Monson Street (SK 9739 7050): evaluation and subsequent excavation in advance of development within the southern suburbs of the Roman city where previous investigations have exposed a polychrome tessellated pavement, late first-century A.D. cremations, and timber and stone structures of second- to fourth-century date. Four phases of Romano-British activity were identified on the site: the earliest activity was represented by an undated pit and post-hole, both containing light grey sandy fills, which elsewhere in the Witham Valley have been considered to represent later prehistoric deposits. These were sealed by a thin cultivation horizon containing a fragment of a samian vessel of Neronian date. Phase 2: towards the west side of the site, a north- south-aligned robber cut for a stone wall was exposed, and dated to the late second century. 124 Excavation by Oxford Archaeology North on behalf of Mr L.

Three further north-south-aligned linear features to the east of the beam-slots were interpreted as a migrating boundary feature of second-century date. Phase 3: the possible timber buildings of Phase 2 had gone out of use by the late second century, to be replaced by at least two pottery kilns. Over-fired and waster sherds suggested that the kilns were producing a range of vessels, including cream ware flagons, grey wares, imitation black burnished wares, and Nene Valley-type finewares. Also in this phase of activity was a large latrine pit containing several very large sherds of Dressel 20 amphora, possibly used as a base or lining to the feature, and a small feature containing several glass fragments that may represent a cremation pit. Phase 4: the kilns appear to have gone out of use by the early third century, and the area was adopted for burial, with a single east-west-aligned inhumation being exposed. Further disarticulated burials were recovered during underpinning works along the road frontage. A small pit containing a charred piglet carcass and ash was also attributed to the third century, a find paralleled nearby in 1982, where a pit containing a piglet skeleton and iron objects was recorded. An east-west boundary ditch was also dated to this phase, as well as a heavily truncated pit containing third- century pottery. Only small quantities of fouth-century pottery were recovered from the site, and there appears to have been a period of abandonment, allowing a deep soil to form, from the end of the Roman period until the area was redeveloped in the medieval period.130 (d) 116 High Street (SK 91 Al 7030): evaluation, in advance of a commercial and residential development, in the southern suburbs of the Roman city revealed part of a sub-circular clay-lined pottery kiln at the base of a primarily medieval site sequence. The feature contained pottery of third-century date and several pieces of kiln furniture, and was sealed by a soil horizon also containing third-century pottery. Five similar structures have also been recorded during investigations off Anchor Street, immediately to the west of the site, attesting to an extensive third-century pottery industry in this area of Lincoln.131 (e) South Common (SK 9745 6970): earthwork survey identified the line of the Roman Ermine Street in the form of a 30 m-long bank and ditch towards the northern edge of the common.132 The presence of the road helps to explain the location of early cremations discovered in this area, and the inscribed tomb of Caius Valerius {RIB 257), standard-bearer of Legion IX Hispana, found nearby in 1909. 133 (f) Hykeham Road (SK 9646 6794): investigation in advance of construction work between Hykeham Road and the River Witham revealed the remains of a Roman pottery industry, including two kilns. The kilns were of 'Swanpool type', and included greyware in their products.134 (g) Newport (SK 9762 7277): an evaluation comprising five trenches was undertaken on land at the former Army Cadet Force HQ. The area lies alongside Ermine Street some 600 m north of the city walls and near to previous discoveries of Roman buildings and burials. The evaluation revealed a group of Roman ditches laid out north-south and east-west. These probably defined boundaries to property or other land parcels alongside the Roman road. Near to the road was an area of Roman funerary activity. Two second- to third-century burials were found, one inhumation with pottery grave goods, and a cremation in an urn. In the same area a pit was partially exposed containing burnt pottery, numerous hobnails and charcoal, possibly a pit for another cremation.135 130 Excavations on behalf of Mr M.

Stone or half-timbered structures appear to have been constructed on the road frontage from the late second/third centuries A.D. and there were slight indications of a preceding timber phase. Situated between two of these structures (Buildings 3 and 5) was a side road which appears to have been a relatively late development (provisionally fourth century), and there are indirect indications that it was possibly associated with a monumental gateway. The excavation was situated close to the southern end of the ribbon development, where there are indications that, in the later Roman period, some buildings were abandoned and, following the dismantling and robbing of structures, certain areas became a focus for rubbish disposal. However, overlying and set amongst the associated rubble and other debris were seemingly haphazard arrangements of stone flooring, rough wall alignments and post settings; possibly indicating a very late or sub-Roman ('squatter') phase of occupation. Situated behind the presumed commercial focus centred on Ermine Street, groups of inhumation burials were exposed, some orientated north- south, others east-west. Spatially, these groups appeared to form discrete clusters to the rear of individual properties and, although difficult to prove, may reflect changing burial practices, from pagan to Christian. Navenby has previously been cited as the location of a probable early fort, partly due to occasional findings of military equipment by metal-detectorists, although to date no evidence of fort defences has been found. On present evidence, it would appear likely that it did perform some kind of official duty - a likely candidate being a mansio serving the demands of the cursus publicus; geophysical survey to the east of Ermine Street has recently identified a double-ditched enclosure, quite distinct, and at distance from, anomalies that would otherwise describe typical ribbon development.136 (4) Sleaford, Hoplands Business Centre (TF 0778 4600): excavations prior to residential development revealed a small nucleated cemetery of some 53 individuals. Burials were uniformly supine, east-west and unaccompanied, fairly regularly spaced with few overlapping; coffin nails were recovered from over half the graves. The cemetery lies 60 m east of Mareham Lane, and some 100 m to the rear of roadside buildings identified to the south. It lay over a dense pattern of second- to third-century features, but the layout was not apparently related to these earlier enclosures. Dispersed burials had previously been identified to the north and east but this represents the first discovery of an organised cemetery at Roman Sleaford.137 (5) Sudbrooke (TF 03700 76500): a five-year seasonal research and training excavation between 2005 and 2009 found evidence for late Iron Age and Roman occupation. Following earlier discoveries of Roman pottery, building material and artefacts made during field walking, a fluxgate gradiometer survey was undertaken and indicated numerous anomalies interpreted as ditches and masonry features. Excavation confirmed that the earliest occupation was represented by a roundhouse of late Iron Age date. Associated with this was a series of large enclosure or boundary ditches, including an extensive rectangular double-ditch enclosure seen predominantly through cropmarks. The ditches were backfilled during the late first century A.D. and contained a significant range of early Roman fine wares. Roman settlement at the site was represented initially by the disturbed remains of three infant burials found within spreads of refuse material of a domestic character. During the early to mid-second century A.D. a rectangular building was constructed of roughly-hewn but well-coursed limestone. The building, interpreted as a bath- house or pavilion, measured 11.5 m by 8 m. There was evidence for the structure having had 136 Excavation for NDC Group Ltd was directed by C. Palmer-Brown and J.

The three principal rooms were decorated with multi-coloured painted wall- plaster panels and, predominantly monochrome, mosaic floors (both wall-plaster and tesserae were primarily recovered from later post-demolition debris). Detached from this structure and approximately 2 m to the south a large (8.5 m by 3 m) masonry-built water tank, cistern or pool was constructed. The tank was lined with opus signinum and had a lead drainage pipe set within its western wall. The pipe discharged into a stone-lined drain, the base of which comprised a cascade of inverted imbrices. Immediately to the south of this feature and partly built into its southern wall was a masonry-lined well (fig. 11). The well was located within a small yard area and is assumed to have delivered water directly to the tank. All these structures were enclosed, during the late second to early third centuries, by a substantial boundary wall. This wall also enclosed a small masonry-built rectangular structure (3 m by 2 m) which lay some 16 m to the west of the main building. This smaller structure was orientated east-west and had a sunken mortar floor. The enclosing boundary wall had a 0.5 m break centred on the western end of the structure, possibly representing an access point. The structure was tentatively interpreted as a mausoleum. All masonry structures on the site were systematically demolished and the debris levelled some time in the later third century. This demolition phase was accompanied by FIG. 1 1 .

The road then carries on along the east bank until it reaches Milford (Muleford in Domesday) where it crosses the Derwent and mounts Firestone Hill (also known as the Chevin) on the west bank. It then climbs the east flank of the Chevin turning northwards from the crossing in a series of short characteristic bursts and passes a Romano-British kiln site at Chevin golf course before running again on a terrace just below and past the crest of the hill in a long straight section, which Cox in 1886 had described as 'quite remarkable'. To this day it remains so; now known as North Lane and part of the Midshires Way, it is perhaps the finest section of extant untouched Roman road remaining in Derbyshire. It comes into the village of Farnah Green from the south, but here its course has been obliterated by the development of the village and its continuation into Longwalls Lane at Blackbrook is only evident on the north side of Farnah Green at SK 3342 4695 once the village fades out. From Farnah Green the route proceeds via Blackbrook, past the recently examined Romano-British quern manufacturing site at Starbuck House143 and the kiln site at Alport144 to Wirksworth. The course north of Blackbrook is as previously stated. 138 Excavation by C. Spence and Z. Tomlinson, Bishop Grosseteste University College Lincoln. C. Spence sent information. 139 Found by Mr C.

These earthworks presumably represent the last remnants of substantial field lynchets of post-Roman date which the landowner removed when creating the modern field. The geophysical survey located two parallel ditches 20 m apart and aligned north- west-south-east (fig. 12). Regularly spaced ditches run from these features at regular intervals forming rectilinear plots.

The area is believed to have been marsh in the prehistoric and early Roman periods and two waterlogged samples from immediately over the natural gravel produced Mesolithic period dates, in contrast to an earlier Iron Age determination.157 (b) 26 Augustus Drive (SP 0854 5719): a trial trench on the western edge of the extramural area of the Roman town on the line of Ryknild Street, revealed two Roman ditches, one possibly a roadside ditch, and a post-hole.158 (2) Great Packington: a silver denarius of Tiberius (mint of Lyon) additional to a previous discovery.159 The total now stands at 17 silver denarii from the Republic to Tiberius (a.D. 37). (3) Sherbourne, M40 Junction 15 improvement (SP 2627 6380): excavation over an area of 27 ha recorded a later Iron Age and Roman agricultural landscape.160 To the north of the M40 near Hampton Road a dense pattern of enclosure ditches and gullies covering an area of 4 ha, together with a ring-gully and a few pits, indicated a focus of settlement. Two inhumation burials were found, and a horse skull had been placed in the terminal of an enclosure ditch. To the south of the motorway a small D-shaped enclosure associated with Iron Age and early Roman pottery appeared to contain two or three roundhouses and numerous pits. This site was planned but not further explored. Some 500 m to the south-west of the D-shaped enclosure two late prehistoric trackways and a corner of a double-ditched enclosure of Roman date were found. Cremated human bone was recovered from a pit. 154 Willis in Gaffney and White, op. cit. (note 153), 174-5. 155 Found while searching with a metal-detector. BM Ref. 2009 T392.

These were succeeded by medieval gullies.161 (5) Stratford-upon-Avon: (a) 77 Tiddington Road (SP 2122 5536): observation on the northern edge of the western cemetery of the Tiddington settlement recorded in 1923-24 revealed part of a single further articulated burial and a sherd of Anglo-Saxon pottery.162 (b) 79 Tiddington Road (SP 2122 5536): trial trenches on the western edge of the Roman settlement, just to the north- east of the cemetery recorded in 1923-24, revealed further Romano-British burials extending at least 25 m further northwards. To the north of the burials there was a series of Roman and early Anglo-Saxon boundary gullies along the edge of the 2nd Gravel Terrace.163 (6) Warwick, 5 Stratford Road (SP 278 643): excavation within the former graveyard of the medieval western suburban church of St Lawrence revealed two small gullies containing Romano-British tile and pottery beneath the medieval burials, along with residual pottery and a third/fourth-century coin in the graveyard soil.164 LEICESTERSHIRE (1) Cadeby Quarry (SK 4921 3027): following a watching-brief on the final quarry area, an excavation was undertaken.165 An Iron Age enclosed settlement, suggested by previous geophysical survey, was revealed. Three sides of a rectangular-shaped ditched enclosure were seen (enclosing c. 1,660 m2), with a substantial south-east-orientated entrance-way, and two sub- rectangular structures within. The pottery indicates a very late Iron Age date. The enclosure was located close to a large linear ditched boundary with scattered features, one with a pottery vessel beneath a quern suggesting structured deposition, while some early Roman features included one lined with kiln bars. (2) Enderby, land between St Johns/Leicester Lane (SP 5520 9956): an excavation was carried out in advance of the Leicester Park and Ride development at Leicester Lane.166 The work focused on excavation of two separate areas (1 and 2) along the eastern boundary of the development area that had been highlighted as having archaeological potential on the basis of prior evaluation. The most striking element of the site was two parallel ditches, running broadly north-south across the excavation area. These were clearly related as they both exhibited the same subtle changes of alignment along their course. Pottery from the eastern ditch suggested that these features originated in the mid to late Iron Age and were probably part of a larger linear monument or trackway. The eastern ditch was eventually abandoned but the western ditch continued to be used after the Roman conquest, potentially becoming integrated into a later settlement with additional gullies extending eastwards beyond the development area dating to the late first to second century A.D. The boundary clearly had territorial importance as five human burials were recorded along its length and a further burial and disarticulated human remains were recorded within the ditch itself. It may still have been important as a territorial marker well into 161 Work by S.C. Palmer, Warwickshire Museum, for Mr N. Clough. N. Palmer sent information. 162 Work by S.C.

A subsequent archaeological watching-brief revealed possible road metalling which may be associated with Fosse Way Roman road. (3) Great Casterton, 3-8 Main Street (TF 001 089): an evaluation of a potential residential development comprised three machine-excavated trenches within the garden of No. 3, where less disturbed areas would be impacted.167 All of the trenches contained archaeologically significant remains, including undisturbed medieval deposits containing redeposited Roman material at depth in Trench 2 and extensive in-situ stone-built structures, one of which was possibly Roman in date, in Trench 3. (4) Leicester: (a) Red Hill, Loughborough Road (SK 5887 0821): in May 2009 human bones were discovered during the excavation of a wildlife pond on an allotment site at Red Hill, Leicester, close to Birstall. A small-scale excavation168 uncovered the remains of two, possibly three, Roman inhumation burials interred after the middle of the third century A.D., with associated pottery vessels and hobnailed footwear. Residual Roman pottery from the excavation suggests activity in the area from the late first century onwards. The burials are likely to form part of a small cemetery associated with a settlement in the near vicinity. The discovery in 1938 of a Roman column drum and capital 200 m away suggests a settlement of some substance, possibly a villa, (b) Land adjacent to Bosworth House , Southgates (SK 583 041): an evaluation169 revealed a c. 1.0 m-deep sequence of largely undisturbed early Roman deposits overlying natural sands and dropping sharply away to the north. Previous archaeological interventions in close proximity to the site suggest that this material represents the tail-end of the second-century Roman town rampart, (c) 61 Oxford Street (SK 5865 0391): an evaluation was undertaken within the Roman and medieval south suburb.170 This revealed a potential Roman road and evidence of pits and spreads suggesting adjacent roadside settlement. A possible disturbed Roman cremation urn and disarticulated human bone were also recovered. (5) Lutterworth: five silver denarii to A.D. 161 additional to an earlier find.171 The total now stands at ten denarii ranging from Titus to the reign of Antoninus Pius. (6) Ratby, land at Ferndale Drive (SK 517 060): following an evaluation, a strip, plan and sample excavation revealed a group of pits and a gully of Roman date.172 (7) South Kilworth, The Grange, North Road (SP 604 819): a strip, plan and sample exercise undertaken following evaluation work recorded evidence of Roman ditches thought to form part of a field-system.173 Pottery of first- to third-century date was associated. (8) Wigston Magna, Ecob's Garden Centre, Horsewell Lane (SP 6070 9795): monitoring of groundworks for the construction of new dwellings revealed a Roman ditch located in a previous evaluation.174 This contained third- to fourth-century pottery and animal bone. 167 Work by G.

The road had previously been traced as far as the north-east corner of Oakley Purlieus Wood; its surface was exposed running a further 220 m south-east, beyond which no clear trace survived. Roadside ditches c. 16 m apart flanked a 6 m-wide roadway with a foundation of coarse angular limestone, fractured ironstone and sand. Deposits were heavily truncated through ploughing, with most of the road metalling lost. The smashed remains of a near-complete second-century flagon were recovered from the roadside ditch, but finds were otherwise sparse. Both ditches contained well-preserved molluscs; the abundance of shade-loving snails suggests that the road ran through a largely wooded area. PETERBOROUGH (1) Castor, Peterborough Road (TL 1231 9842): area stripping during building renovation revealed the remains of a substantial Roman building.176 Wall lines identifiable from robber trenches defined rooms covering at least 16 m by 7 m and continuing beyond the excavation area to the east and under the extant building to the north. Deposits were severely truncated but fragments of a hypocaust system survived in the southern room with a flue in the south-west corner and a pattern of bases for pilae identifiable on the concrete floor. The remains lie close to the site of a building excavated by E.T. Artis and located on his plan of 1828. The poor nature of survival might suggest that this area had previously been exposed, but if the surviving barns are accurately depicted by Artis then this must represent a separate building range. (2) Peterborough, Yaxley Broadway (TL 5191 2931): an open area excavation covering approximately one hectare revealed evidence of middle to late Iron Age activity and a late Roman farmstead.177 The Iron Age activity consisted of outlying enclosures and field boundaries which may have belonged to a settlement previously excavated to the south-west. In the main, sub- square enclosure was a smaller C-shaped enclosure which may relate to a shelter or structure, along with a partial roundhouse. The Roman farmstead formed part of a larger settlement to the south-west. A 'ladder' enclosure system was encountered with many of the ditches being backfilled with dumps of rubbish containing pottery, animal bone, tile and 26 coins, dating mainly to the third and fourth centuries. Six large stone-packed post-holes marked the southern end of an aisled building, possibly a barn. The surrounding ditches contained quantities of stone, which may have come from the aisled building. A rectangular tank, cut into the geology with evidence of wood lining, was also discovered. CAMBRIDGESHIRE (1) Cherry Hinton, War Ditches (TL 484 556): an area of the ditch of this enigmatic circular enclosure was examined in advance of opening of the extensively-quarried site as a nature reserve.178 The ditch was approximately 6 m wide (although truncated by the quarry along its inner edge) and 4 m deep. Pottery suggests that it was dug during the early Iron Age, but late pre-Roman Iron Age and Conquest period material came from the upper metre of the ditch fills. 175 Work by Archaeological Project Services for Bela Developments.

(2) Ely, Stirling Way , near Witchford (TL 5150 7890): during the late Iron Age a settlement was established on the plateau of a small knoll. A large late Iron Age or early Roman boundary ditch meandered along the top contour of a ridge which ran roughly parallel to and overlooked a strategic stream/drain route flowing from Grunty Fen into West Fen. The role of this ditch may be linked to the name Witchford which derives from 'the Watch on the Ford'. Three burials lay within a small ditched enclosure close to the boundary. A mid-first-century A.D. cremation burial was placed within a late pre-Roman Iron Age grey ware vessel. Two second- or early third-century inhumations were also found. A mature woman had been buried on top of two bone spindle-whorls. The other burial, in a relatively deep grave, was of a woman aged between 26 and 44 with five copper-alloy rings on her left hand, including three on a single finger. Two pots - one a complete Nene Valley folded beaker - were placed nearby within the enclosing ditch.179 (3) Impington, Unwins Nursery site (TL 4430 6350): evaluation revealed a number of ditches spanning at least two phases of activity. The earlier phase dated to the late Iron Age to first century A.D. and generally comprised large field boundaries. The second phase was attributed to the mid-first to the mid-second century A.D. and saw the re-establishment of these earlier ditches together with a greater density of ditches at the southern end of the site. These ditches, close to and almost parallel with the current Impington Lane, contained a large quantity of locally produced, sandy coarseware storage and cooking vessels, which may indicate close proximity to settlement. A brooch and a sherd of samian pottery were amongst the other finds from this phase. The earliest occupation found during the subsequent excavation dates to the late Iron Age (i c . 100 b.c.) and included a roundhouse. Enclosures and ditches dating to the second and third centuries a.D. were present, with numerous finds again suggesting the proximity of contemporary domestic structures.180 (4) Kimbolton, proposed Bicton Windfarm (TL 100 704): features relating to a ?late Iron Age to Roman farmstead and its outlying fields were found.181 In one trench, in addition to the large ditches identified by cropmarks, several smaller ditches, pits and a cobbled surface were found which may represent three phases of activity. Moderate quantities of pottery and animal bone were recovered. Secondary deposits of burnt material, and a piece of hearth lining with slag attached imply some localised industrial activity. Extending for a distance of about 150 m beyond and to the north-east of the area of cropmarks, further ditches (possibly field boundaries) were identified associated with occasional Roman pottery. (5) Over, Plot 5 , Over Industrial Estate (TL 3790 6930): Roman features and deposits were located across the development area182 but were concentrated in the northernmost trench where at least two phases of activity were recorded, interrupted by an episode of flooding. Pottery from features in the northern half of the site indicates settlement in the near vicinity. Charred plant remains were found in abundance indicating that primary crop-processing was taking place on the site or very close by. 179 Excavation by R. Atkins of Oxford Archaeology East. E.

Ditches and small pits containing late Iron Age and Romano-British domestic debris occurred within the western part of the trench. With the exception of quarry pits, which were dug into the edge of the gravel terrace, no focus of activity could be identified. The quarry pits were overlaid by a cambered road c. 5 m wide believed to be Roman in origin. Some of the ditches were substantial and, like the road, were clearly part of the Romano-British settlement identified to the north.185 On the basis of the recent and previous investigations and non-intrusive survey, the overall extent of the settlement is now known to be over 18 ha. HERTFORDSHIRE (1) Baldock, Baldock station (TQ 24576 34576): four evaluation trenches were excavated in the sloped, wooded area opposite the station.186 The chalk natural was shown to slope downwards from east to west, in line with the present-day topography. A trench in the eastern half of the site exposed a substantial but undated linear feature which extended the length of the trench. This was cut by three later features, including a V-shaped, east-west-aligned linear one which contained two Roman coins: one dating to c. A.D. 315-320, the other to c. A.D. 340-350. Another Roman coin was recovered from a shallow, irregular feature which also cut the earlier north- south ditch. A third linear feature cut the north-south ditch in the southern end of the trench; its fill contained a pottery assemblage which included a sherd of terra rubra , dating to the Conquest period. Upslope, in the eastern part of the site, another trench exposed two inter-cutting, east- west-aligned ditches, one of which is likely to be a continuation of the ditch in the previous trench. They were sealed by a general dump layer dated to the later Roman period. BUCKINGHAMSHIRE (1) Aylesbury, Fleet Marston (SP 7751 1645): an evaluation187 revealed evidence of a Romano- British settlement, including both circular and rectangular enclosures, boundary ditches, two potentially revetted ditches or beamslots forming part of a Roman track or building, and a gravel spread probably associated with a north-south Roman road identified during previous excavation in the vicinity of the site. The archaeological remains were sited to the north of a small Roman town located on a crossroad of Akeman Street and the north-south road that runs through the site, suggesting that the settlement was peripheral to the town. Overall, the pottery assemblage recovered on site seems to suggest a relatively low-status community. (2) Denham, The Lea (TQ 0490 8600): a further phase of excavation in advance of gravel extraction revealed the eastern part of an enclosure which probably dates to the first to second centuries A.D.

A pit or ditch terminal also recorded may be of middle Iron Age date.189 (4) Hambleden, Yewden Lodge Villa , Horseleys Field (SU 784 855): a fluxgate-magnetometer survey was carried out190 in the environs of the scheduled villa site at Yewden Lodge, which was substantially excavated in the early years of the twentieth century.191 The geophysical survey was targeted on a pasture field (Horseleys) directly east of the field containing the Yewden villa where outlying elements of the main villa complex in the form of enclosures, trackways and a possible Romano-British temple or shrine are indicated on aerial photographs adjacent to the former course of the Hamble Brook. The survey identified several ditched enclosures with adjoining trackways. Some contained internal positive anomalies possibly indicative of large pits, quarries or industrial features. MILTON KEYNES (1) Brooklands (SP 910 397): open-area excavations were targeted on five areas previously revealed by trial trenching and geophysical survey to be rich in archaeological features.192 Areas 6 and 8, which were adjacent but separated by a modern road, produced evidence for middle Iron Age settlement. This was overlain by a late Iron Age to early Roman ditched enclosure and trackway, which probably linked the site to the major Iron Age and Roman settlement at Broughton Manor Farm, just a few hundred metres to the west. Activity at Area 7 comprised a middle to late Roman enclosure (probably established between the mid and late second century), along with a north-south trackway and a number of smaller enclosures, possibly used as animal pens, and a scatter of pits. The upper fills of the enclosure ditch produced a mixed assemblage of late Roman and early Anglo-Saxon pottery, suggesting possible continuity of occupation into the fifth and sixth centuries. OXFORDSHIRE (1) Abingdon, Abingdon Museum (SU 4979 9705): pits or post-holes were recorded within two test-pits to the south of the museum. Though undated, they were overlain by a sequence of metalled Roman road surfaces. The earlier sequence of surfaces suggests that the road was generally well maintained with periodic resurfacing. In contrast, the latest surfaces were crudely repaired with cobbles and pebbles, representing the road's disuse in the late Roman and early Saxon periods. A gully dated to the late third or fourth century was possibly a drainage feature, suggesting that the road was aligned north-west to south-east. The bases of pits, dated by pottery to the first or second century, were recorded.193 (2) Beckley, Thames Water pipeline and new STW (SP 56201150-56411167 &amp; 56601150- 56561190): a watching-brief was undertaken as part of the works for a new sewerage system for the village.194 A number of archaeological features were uncovered including sections of a Roman road. 189 Work by G.

Most of the pits have yet to be examined, but a late Roman or even later date seems likely. Some of them related to a sequence of dark earth deposits which originally covered most of the site. These deposits were particularly substantial in the central area of the site, where successive spreads of stone within them (including a possible building- platform identified in 2008) indicate that they accumulated over an extended period. Removal of the dark earths in the north-western part of the site, where they were thinner, revealed mixed gravel deposits, again cut by pits in places. One well-defined sub-rectangular patch of gravel possibly formed the floor of a building. The dark earths also sealed features identified in earlier excavations by Professor Frere as wall trenches for a Saxon building. Re-examination showed that these features were very different in character - one a shallow slot, the other a substantial steep-sided ditch. It is possible that the latter was of Roman date, with Saxon material from the upper fills. The finds include an important late Roman pottery assemblage, and early Saxon pottery was also recovered, along with two ring-shaped loomweight fragments. The most significant individual object was a second late Roman buckle of Hawkes type IB (an unstratified example was found in 2008) from one of the components of the dark earth deposits. The recovery of two of these buckles from a small excavation area is notable and underlines the importance of Dorchester for the understanding of events at the very end of the Roman period in Britain. An enigmatic object found in 2008 proved to be a fine copper-alloy Medusa head mount, probably of third- or fourth-century date. This seems to have been reused as it is backed with a very substantial lump of lead, originally contained within thin copper-alloy sheeting. The function of this apparently composite object remains obscure. (4) Headington, Warneford Hospital (SP 538 059): a ditch containing pottery of a broad Roman date and a post-hole were recorded.196 (5) Souldern, High Street , Manor Farm (SP 5207 3165): a watching-brief was conducted during groundworks for a new development.197 A 'Belgie' urn containing a cremation burial was found.

These might be associated with the small settlement previously identified at Stanford in the Vale.198 (7) Swinbrook, South Lawn Farm (SP 2879 1460): a watching-brief revealed four gullies, two ditches, two further possible ditches, and two post-holes.

EAST ANGLIA By PAUL BOOTH NORFOLK (1) Attleborough: four silver/base silver denarii and one base silver radiate to A.D. 217. 200 (2) Brancaster, Marsh Lane (TF 7792 4417): construction work was monitored on a site immediately west of the Scheduled area of the Roman fort of Branodunum and vicus and north of the settlement area outside of the fort excavated in 1974-77.201 A number of slight ditches crossed the area, only one of which yielded Roman pottery. However, the early to mid-second- century date range for occupation suggested by the pottery is significant as previous work had indicated that occupation of the fort and vicus complex commenced only in the late second century. (3) Dereham: 44 silver/base-silver denarii and 1 base-silver radiate, addenda to a large hoard of over 1,000 coins discovered by the same finders from 2004.202 The latest coin in the addenda (and latest overall so far) is a denarius of Gordian III, A.D. 241 ( RIC 129). (4) Near Kings Lynn: a clipped silver siliqua of Valentinian II {RIC IX, 43 or 57, A.D. 375-83), drilled with a central hole, transforming it into a pendant or, more probably, a mount.203 (5) Swanton Morley: 24 copper-alloy nummi to A.D. 353, scattered over a confined area from which other coins were also recovered.204 The 24 coins, all large copper-alloy nummi of Constantius II, Constans and Magnentius, were recognized as being from a dispersed hoard. SUFFOLK (1) Capel St Mary, Days Road (TM/08 38; CSM 030): trenching and open area excavation was undertaken at a c. 1 .2 ha site to the north of Capel St Mary in advance of housing development.205 The site produced the remains of part of an enclosed settlement dated broadly to the Iron Age, and a large number of medieval features, including structures, ditches, pits and probable quarry pits. In addition, evidence of smaller scale activity of Bronze Age and Roman date was also encountered. A rectangular post-built structure associated with mid-first- to second-century pottery represents a relatively low-key Roman presence in the south of the site.

A medieval robber trench marked the position of the wall of a Roman building which stood in the north-eastern quarter of the insula, and an adjacent fragment of compacted clay represented the floor of a Roman building probably pre-dating the robbed wall.217 (c) East Hill House , 78 High Street (TM 00852 25227): this site lies in Insula 31/32 of the Roman town. Prior to the refurbishment of East Hill House, three trenches revealed parts of two Roman buildings, presumably town-houses, one of which had a hypocaust, and the other at least one area of tessellated pavement.218 (d) Roman town wall at Roman Road (TM 00177 25385): two trial-trenches excavated as part of a conservation strategy outside the upstanding parts of the eastern side of the Roman town wall (a scheduled ancient monument) confirmed that even where the wall has been robbed and replaced with later material, original parts survive in situ below ground.219 (e) Colnebank House, 30 St Peter s Street (TL 9651 5590): evaluation of this site, lying 40 m north of the north wall of the Roman town, and on the south bank of the River Colne, exposed river gravels containing Roman brick debris at 2.1-2.5 m below current site level.220 (3) Great Chesterford: three denarii, the latest of Faustina II (up to a.D. 176).221 (4) Great Dunmow: (a) 2 Chequers Lane (TL 6247 2194): an evaluation on the northern edge of the Roman small town revealed a compacted gravel surface which is the northerly continuation of a Roman gravel road identified in the 1970s.222 Subsequent monitoring revealed further areas of Roman gravel road, and Roman pits.223 (b) Salerooms, Chequers Lane (TL 6265 2189): this site is immediately east of the 1970s excavation site and approximately 100 m south-east of the site at 2 Chequers Lane. A trial-trench and excavation224 revealed a thick deposit of gravel bounded by a ditch on its southern side. Given its position and alignment, this must be the continuation of an east-west Roman road whose course was indicated by road-side ditch alignments on the 1970s site. Twenty-three Roman inhumation burials were clustered on the north edge of the site (the Chequers Lane frontage). No human bone survived, but a number of the graves contained hobnails and pots (often fragmentary). In contrast to the 1970s site, there were no cremation burials. A number of small features may have been post-holes containing grave markers. A semi- circular feature cut some of the graves. It is uncertain whether this was a ring-ditch around a grave, or (given the shrine on the adjacent 1970s site) of ritual origin. (5) Kelvedon, 193 High Street (TL 8631 1913): an area excavation225 close to the Roman small town at Kelvedon revealed a Roman pit and ditch.

Pottery suggests that occupation continued into the late first century A.D. (d) Theydon Garnon , Pond 1609 (TQ 4794 9951): several small and shallow pits containing charcoal and occasional Roman pottery sherds were recorded.226 (7) Sandon, Chelmsford Park &amp; Ride site (TL 744 055): area excavation revealed a Roman- period sub-circular enclosure (40 m in diameter) to the south of a Bronze Age ring-ditch.227 (8) Stanford-le-Hope, London Gateway Compensation Site A, Wharf Road (TQ 698 811): excavation228 revealed two areas (A and B) of early Roman salt extraction located adjacent to large creeks. There is very little evidence for domestic occupation in the early Roman period; pottery and other artefact assemblages are notably sparse, particularly when compared with the artefact-rich late Roman sequence. The early Roman evaporation hearths survived as shallow oval or sub-rectangular scoops. Clay-lined pits, interpreted as settling tanks and present in both Areas A and B, consisted of long troughs lined with clay, sub-divided by clay walls to form rows of three tanks. The two salterns appear to have been organised differently: Area B had four hearths and two rows of settling tanks, clustered in a tight group in one corner of the saltern mound and with no sign of associated buildings or shelters. In Area A, traces of low mounds or 'red hills' formed a slight ridge along the north edge of the area. The surviving hearths were more dispersed and mostly found in association with built structures. One hearth and a single row of settling tanks were found inside a large roundhouse (dated by pottery to the later second or early third century). Wooden structures from the site include a pair of channel revetments made of wattlework, a possible footbridge made from piled oak timbers and found within a channel alongside the Area B saltern mound, and a U-shaped timber structure in Area A, interpreted as a boathouse, radiocarbon dated to the first or early second century. One of the more unusual features of the site is a probable saltern dating to the late third or fourth century. This appears to have used a substantially different process and was probably organised differently from the early Roman salterns. A large, robust hearth of this phase survived almost intact; it formed a low circular structure built from two courses of tile, with three raised pillars surviving to three courses. Lumps of fired clay with white residues suggest that salt evaporation is the most likely function of this hearth. The late Roman area also included a very unusual building with a circular clay floor, c. 15 m in diameter, surrounded by a shallow gully. The structure was supported by a square arrangement of four massive posts built on post-pads of chalk and flint rubble, set in the base of square pits. Masses of pottery were found in association with the late Roman sequence, concentrated in an extensive midden.

In the central section of the street on the west side, dumped deposits containing Roman pottery were cut by part of a Roman or medieval chalk wall. Adjacent to this on the east side of the street, a sequence of Roman dumping (containing pottery and building material) was sealed by deposits containing medieval pottery. Among the Roman dumped deposits was a small palette, used for the grinding of cosmetics or medicaments. It was finely cut, unusually small (39.8 by 25.1 by 9.9 mm), and made from imported white marble (fig. 13) The majority of palettes found in London have been made of fine-grained stone, shale, or Purbeck marble, although two other marble examples have been found at No. 1 Poultry (ONE94) and Gresham Street (GHT00). 230 Found by Mr J.

Archaeological investigations235 are taking place in tandem with demolition/ refurbishment of the site. The excavation/watching-brief recommenced in January 2009, following on from work carried out in December 2007 and throughout 2008. 236 The site forms part of the Scheduled Ancient Monument known as the 'Roman Governor's Palace'. Work in 2009 focused on an area immediately adjacent to, but just outside the west limit of the Scheduled Ancient Monument along the Dowgate Hill street frontage. A series of vertical king-posts had previously been piled along the edge of the viaduct to facilitate insertion of a new basement wall. As the wall was constructed, a narrow strip of archaeological material c. 18 m in length by c. 0.50 m wide was exposed and recorded. Limited evidence for pre-Palace structures (pre-A.D. 69) included a small fragment of mortar floor and a well-preserved opus signinum floor. Non- structural features/deposits included sequences of dump layers/trample and rubbish-pitting. A substantial building sequence developed along the length of the strip in the early to mid-second century (a.D. 120-160). Structural features included ragstone/chalk foundations, ragstone walls, mortar floors/surfaces and a small fragment of rendered flint/tile wall with tessellated floor. Evidence for later Roman activity was limited to a 0.6 m-thick 'organic' clay-silt deposit (dated a.D. 350-400), probably a dump layer or garden soil rather than abandonment 'dark earth'. (3) Crosby Square (The Pinnacle ), EC2 (TQ 33135 81239): a first phase of excavation was carried out to the west and south of the secant wall trench excavated during 2008. Natural brickearth was cut by pits with sterile fills, probably representing quarries. Sealing these in the east and south were fragmented remains of Roman clay-and-timber buildings, one of which had a plain red tessellated floor. In the north-west of the excavated area running north-south was a Roman masonry drain built in re-used roof tiles. These were sealed by thick dumps of redeposited brickearth containing fragments of painted wall-plaster. Mainly in the south and east of the area, the Roman building remains had been cut into by a series of pits of either late 235 Work by J. Taylor, Museum of London Archaeology, for Hines UK (CNV08). V.

A second phase of excavation was carried out in the remaining small triangle in the north-east corner of Crosby Square after the insertion of the Martello piles. Natural brickearth was cut by a series of shallow features, which were probably quarries, and one possible grave. No human remains were found in this feature and it is possible that these were relocated when the early Roman settlement expanded into this area. Over these cuts were the robbed foundations of a Roman masonry building. At least two rooms associated with this building were found, all with earth floors. Cutting east-west across the remains of this building was a Roman masonry drain (a wider return to the one found in the first excavation phase). These remains were again sealed by thick wall-plaster-rich dumps and medieval features.237 (4) 20 Fenchurch Street, EC3 (TQ 3308 8088): the majority of the deposits excavated on the site dated to the Roman period.238 At the earliest levels a series of structural features were cut into the natural sand and gravel. In the southern and eastern areas of the site linear cuts complemented by a pattern of post- and stake-holes were recorded. They possibly represent early Roman occupation prior to the Boudiccan fire. Also at this level was a timber-lined drain in the base of a linear cut running east-west through the west area of the site. Sealing these was a layer of burning, identified more or less across the site, averaging approximately 100 mm thick and tentatively identified as Boudiccan fire deposits. Directly above this layer were a number of features which could possibly be linked to the suspected fort, identified on an earlier excavation on the nearby site of Plantation Place. In the eastern Rood Lane area of excavation a hastily laid and temporarily used road, on a north-south alignment, was recorded. To the east of this was a large 'oven' feature, too large to be for domestic use, which may have been linked to the provision for troops. Above these phases an abundance of clay-and-timber building remains and other probably domestic occupation deposits was excavated. It was not always possible to deduce their extent or alignment due to the fragmentary nature of the evidence, but a general Roman alignment, different from that of the modern street, can be seen. Cutting through these deposits, three sides of a large ragstone cellar were observed. The walls measured approximately 0.83 m wide and survived to a depth of 0.88 m. The stone blocks in this construction were substantial and indicate that they formed the foundations of a multi-storied building on the site. Within this basement structure was a relatively thin partition wall running north-south. A series of brickearth floors abutted this wall at the base, then at a later date the wall was evidently removed to a low level and several floor layers were recorded covering these remains, presumably filling the now open basement area. Other late features include a line of substantial post-holes representing a building adjacent to the cellar to the west. A square well was discovered nearby. In 10 Rood Lane there were also late Roman ragstone foundations running both north-south and east-west which appeared to consist of at least two phases of construction. Roman industry was represented by a hearth sequence and burnt deposits with possible metalworking associations in the north-west corner of the site. In the western area of the site was a pit with traces of lime still remaining in the base. (5) Gres ham Street dropshafts, corner of Gres ham Street and Milk Street (outside No. 2 Gres ham Street ), EC1 (TQ 32393 81336): four dropshafts were monitored.239 In one, a north-south-aligned ragstone wall with a chalk foundation of Roman or medieval date was observed. 237 Work by K.

(7) Copthall Avenue, EC2 (TQ 3279 8137): excavation241 continued from 2006 revealing late first- to early second-century levelling layers, cut by a light timber revetment which supported the south bank of a ditch or stream channel. Sealing these features were possible occupational horizons, domestic waste pits and dumped deposits. A second phase of revetting was revealed, together with an adjacent series of timber piles, which may form the foundation of a wall of early third-century date. A series of third- to fourth-century dumped deposits sealed the features.

One feature was identified as a possible linear ditch on a north-south alignment, with some evidence of recutting. A cremation burial had been cut into the edge of the ditch.

A linear ditch, with associated pitting and post-holes, bisected the curvilinear ditch and represented a second phase of activity during the late first century. The final phase, dating from the late first to mid-second century, included numerous intercutting pits, which truncated the linear ditch. All features encountered were indicative of settlement and were sealed by an extensive deposit of twentieth-century rubble. LAMBETH (1) Mary Seacole House, 91 Clapham High Street, SW4 (TQ 29775 75440): three evaluation trenches were excavated, but no evidence was found for Stane Street (Margary 15) which is known to run through this area of Clapham.254 LEWISHAM (1) Honor Oak Park Sports Ground, Brockley Rise, SE4 (TQ 36505 74248): an evaluation in 2008 had found areas of gravel metalling, presumed to be part of a Roman road, in three trenches on the west side of the sports ground. During the 1930s, it was sectioned in a number of places between West Wickham and Peckham by Davis255 and its course projected between these observations. A watching-brief256 confirmed the projected route of the road, crossing the western part of the site, and gravel surfaces found these were at a similar level to those recorded by Davis, although they have been subject to truncation by the levelling of the area for sports pitches. A dupondius of Domitian (a.D. 81-96) was found at the south-east end of the road, but no other Roman finds were recovered. The road showed evidence of being severely truncated, leaving only the lower sandy bedding material of the road's make-up at the south-east end and a harder, more solid gravel surface at the north-west end. In the centre of the watching-brief area the road had been disturbed by the construction of a modern sports pavilion. The construction of the sports ground in the 1950s had resulted in the total removal of the southern extent of the road, though it may survive under a raised area at the extreme southern end of the sports ground. The surviving road make-up has been preserved in situ. NEWHAM (1) Abbey Road DLR Station, Abbey Road, Stratford, El 5 (TQ 39080 83410): a single pit, possibly of Roman date, produced a combed flue-tile.

These remains included two east-west-aligned ragstone and tile walls, a mortar floor, and three tile stacks (pilae ). The area of the hypocaust and one of the walls was infilled with a series of demolition deposits which included mortar fragments and occasional fragments of tesserae. Demolition layers near the other wall were overlaid by 'dark earth' deposits. (2) St Michaels Catholic School , John Felton Road ' Bermondsey, SE 16 (TQ 24225 79669): following work in 2008, two areas on the east side of the playground were identified for further excavation.259 Natural sand and gravels were overlain by a soil horizon of Roman date. Towards the south of the site, several first- to second-century quarry pits were recorded, sealed by a further soil horizon containing significant quantities of Roman pottery dated to the first- to third- centuries. A large channel backfilled with Roman deposits was located running NE-SW towards the River Thames. Significant quantities of residual pottery of late Bronze Age to late Iron Age date were also retrieved from Roman deposits. (3) Tate Modern, Bankside , SEI (TQ 31925 80390): a borehole to the north-west of the Tate Modern located Roman building material (dated A.D. 50-160) within deposits immediately overlying natural gravel. Borehole profiles provided evidence for a rise in ground level towards an eyot located to the south-west of the site.260 (4) Abbey Street, SE16 (TQ 3376 7940): an evaluation uncovered a Roman ditch with associated stake-holes. The fill of the ditch contained a high percentage of both iron-smithing and smelting waste, which suggests that industrial activity was taking place in the vicinity of the site.261 (5) Bermondsey Square, SEI (TQ 3328 7933): an excavation recorded a series of Roman pits underneath a layer of Saxon agricultural soil.262 (6) Igloo Regeneration, Bermondsey Square, Island Site, SEI (TQ 3330 7930): excavation continued at the site of the Scheduled Ancient Monument of Bermondsey Abbey.263 This phase of work was to the east of the previously excavated area, on a small parcel of land known as The Island, and revealed a series of early to late Roman pits and ditches. (7) 28-30 Trinity Street, SEI (TQ 3245 7940): excavations carried out between 2007 and 2009 uncovered a number of third- to fifth-century inhumation burials, cremation burials, and a sequence of late first- to early fifth-century ditches.264 The site is situated to the south of the Roman suburb of Southwark and was thought to lie on the margins of the cemetery area previously investigated at 165 Great Dover Street. Although some areas were devoid of burials, which in part reflected the severe truncation caused by modern basements, inhumations were discovered on or close to the site boundaries on the north, west and east sides, demonstrating that the cemetery extended 258 Work by Tony Mackinder, Museum of London Archaeology, for New London Bridge House Ltd (LBN08).

A total of 44 inhumation burials and two cremation burials in urns, one of which was found with an inhumation, were recorded. The inhumation cemetery might have been established in the very late second century but the vast majority of the burials dated to the third and fourth centuries. Coins recovered from the graves or associated soil horizons demonstrated that some of the burials are among the latest Roman graves excavated in London as they were associated with coins dated a.D. 388^02. These burials may well have dated to the early fifth century. A sequence of ditch systems dating from late first or early second century through to the late fourth to early fifth century covered most of the excavated area, although none of the ditches remained in use throughout the entire Roman period. An early focus dated to the late first or early second century was identified in the southern part of the site. The early ditch system enclosed what may have been a large colonnaded timber structure built on substantial timber beam foundations. These features are located close to a previously known early Roman inhumation, found at Harper Road, dated A.D. 50-70. Although the number of graves was relatively small, many forms of burial common to late Roman cemeteries were evident. Some graves had been furnished with coffins, evident as nails or other fittings, and three plaster burials were recorded. No single grave orientation predominated and examples of north-south and east- west aligned burials were found superimposed on each other. It is probable that the cemetery was divided into areas by enclosures. Although no actual trace of these structures was evident some areas of the cemetery were devoid of burials whilst others were densely occupied. Spoil was systematically metal-detected and this resulted in the recovery of around 150 coins, mostly of late Roman date. These have given a very good insight into the periods in which the site was being utilised and highlighted the fact that Romanised life appears to have continued on the southern margins of Londinium until the last years of the fourth century and very probably the early fifth century, a view previously highlighted by excavations at Tabard Square. (8) Thameslink 2000 : Borough Viaduct , SEI - Hop Exchange Viaduct , Pile Caps Hl-J (TQ 32584 80194): the earliest Roman evidence consisted of an east-west-aligned ditch which had truncated a north-south-aligned palisade trench comprising pairs of stake-holes placed within a ditch with a pair of larger supporting post-holes. At the eastern end of the trench was a building formed by driven post-piles, represented by a series of closely grouped post-holes. This had a possible entrance along the north side, suggested by the lack of post-holes in this location and a much larger post-hole on the west side. This area was heavily slumped and later filled with sand. Within the building a rare complete copper-alloy oil lamp was recovered. To the east, a furnace or burnt post structure was uncovered, comprising four post-holes and a linear cut containing burnt wood and charcoal. Gravel and sand surfaces for a possible external yard or workshop area produced a number of sherds of samian ware with graffiti such as an 'X' incised on the base. The remains of a north-east-south-west-aligned late Roman (a.D. 250-350) masonry building, with two of its walls robbed, overlay the earlier timber building. A series of make-up and brickearth floor surfaces were removed from the building. Beneath the floor surfaces was another small furnace which produced a stone hone. To the north of the furnace was a series of charcoal layers, one of which produced a complete (although distorted) crucible, suggesting small-scale metalworking. Within the western part of the trench was a structure formed of a series of fairly large post-holes and an associated rectangular pit.265 (9) Thameslink 2000: Borough Viaduct, SEI - Park Street Viaduct Pile Caps A &amp; B (TQ 32531 80181): the Park Street area is located at the western end of the viaduct project. Natural sand and gravel were cut by a small feature from which a small waste flint flake of prehistoric date and a single sherd of possible Iron Age pottery were recovered. The natural deposits were 265 Work by D. Saxby, Museum of London Archaeology, for Network Rail (BVT09). V.

Following the demise of this building, there is evidence for levelling activity in the form of dumped sand and gravel. Thereafter, pits and spreads of mortar and plaster testify to a second phase of Roman building, with the construction of a large masonry building on the same alignment as the earlier timber structure. A robber cut was recorded running at right angles (east-west), while painted plaster and fragments of marble suggest that the building may have been of high status. To the west, a clay-and-timber building on the same alignment was recorded, with brickearth sills, gravel surfaces and collapsed painted plaster. Tile and charcoal spreads (evidence for fire or industrial working) were associated with amphorae and samian ware of first- to second-century date.266 SOUTHWARK AND CITY OF LONDON (1) Thameslink Project, Blackfriars Station, EC4 and SEI (TQ 317 808, north bank and TQ 317 805, south bank): a geo-archaeological evaluation was carried out on both sides of the River Thames as part of the Thameslink project at Blackfriars Station.267 This showed that the north and south banks differ significantly in character; on the north side, Ludgate Hill rises steeply on the east of the Fleet River, while on the south side there are sandy, low-lying islands. On the south side, the site lies within the Neckinger (a Thames tributary) which runs between two islands, the Hopton Street and Lambeth North Eyots, which are now buried beneath alluvium and modern deposits. A deep depression in the river bed at the base of the profile on the north bank is interpreted as Late Glacial river scour. Deposits and finds from boreholes indicate this hollow filled up with gravel during the Roman period, perhaps as a result of lower river levels. Roman intertidal or channel sediments have been tentatively identified on both sides of the river, deposited at the mouths of the Fleet and the Neckinger. TOWER HAMLETS (1) Gladstone Place, Bow, E3 (TQ 368 832): excavation revealed a sequence of quarrying activity from the first to the late third century.268 The quarries appear to have been filled by the fourth century, when the area changed use and was utilised for the disposal of rubbish. During this period a boundary ditch was also established immediately to the east of the area of pitting. WALTHAM FOREST (1) Holy Family Technology College, Church Hill Road, Walthamstow, E17 (TQ 37938 89326): an evaluation revealed a series of Roman features representing activity from the first century to the early fifth century.269 The features comprised a post-hole, a possible pit and a linear ditch, all dated to the early Roman period, whilst eight linear ditches, a series of post-holes and a possible surface were dated to the late Roman period. The alignment of the ditches, the presence of daub and post-packing in many of the post-holes, and the floor surface seem to suggest the presence of a substantial structure during the late Roman period. 266 Work by P.

Residual Roman finds were recovered from both of these sites. 8. SOUTH-WESTERN COUNTIES By PAUL BOOTH GLOUCESTERSHIRE (1) Bourton-on-the- Water, Cotswold School (SP 1674 2116): excavation revealed the corner of a double-ditched enclosure. A worn siliqua of Gratian (a.D. 367-383) or Valentinian I (a.D. 364-375) was recovered from the primary fill of the outer enclosure ditch.271 (2) Cirencester, Kingshill South (SP 036 010): a large rectangular building, 19.5 m by 14 m, with walls and foundations over 0.5 m deep, was excavated in advance of housing development.272 There was evidence of storage, lined tanks, hearths, clay floors, and stone post pads. The building was set in an agricultural landscape. The area was subdivided with ditches, and a sequence of two corn-driers with an associated surface, ditches and revetment wall was uncovered. The ditches were available for rubbish disposal, as suggested by the large amount of processed bone waste in one 3 m stretch. Four inhumation burials and numerous neonatal remains were also discovered. An apsidal structure, over 8.5 m in length and 11.5 m wide, was found at the western end of the site. On initial inspection its form suggested a mausoleum, ritual enclosure, or temple, but the structure remains enigmatic; industrial residue, pits and partial sheep remains suggest a more utilitarian use. However, one of the most intriguing elements was a small 'garden style' wall, 35 m to the east, which perfectly reflected the apsidal end. In addition, there were the tentative remains of several other similar walls and a series of possible terrace walls on the slope south of the main building. The finds from the site were of a broad range, including over 100 coins, 30 brooches, four fragments of stamped samian, a pair of lead weights, two spoons, parts of personal hygiene kits, tiles from the roofs, possible spindle whorls, and a large amount of pottery and animal bone (which included a single articulated horse leg). Dating evidence pointed to occupation throughout the Roman period, though pottery from the buildings suggests a second- or third-century date for their construction. (3) Winchcombe, land off Greet Road (SP 02357 29341): a geophysical survey was followed by excavation of 30 evaluation trenches totalling 900 m in length.273 A large enclosed middle to late Iron Age settlement existed to the south of the area and partly within the southern part of the site. Activity extended for several hundred metres to the north outside the enclosure. This area was then used for agriculture in the early Roman period. Towards the middle of the 270 Work by R.

These structures were built of stone, decorated with painted plaster and with well constructed opus signinum floors. A major secondary building phase may have included timber structures. North of the villa complex was a series of contemporary enclosed areas, possibly fields and animal pens. Trackways appear to have existed between these and possibly linked them to the buildings. The site appears to have been abandoned towards the end of the third century. While it is likely that the site represents domestic occupation and associated agricultural activity, there is some evidence for possible ritual/religious structures and practices from the Iron Age into the Roman period.

(2) Hove, Droveway to Fishergate substation, EDF cable trench (TQ 25299 0245 1-TQ 28652 06503): a watching-brief was undertaken along a 4.8 km long 33kV electricity cable route from the Fishergate grid substation in Southwick, West Sussex, to a proposed new substation at the Droveway, Hove Park, in East Sussex.297 Although the route of the cable trench passed near the known Roman burial ground at Victoria Park, Portslade, and the Roman villa at Hove Park, Hove, no features were located which could be positively identified with either of these sites. SURREY (1) Abinger, Cocks Farm villa (TQ 106 474): a small-scale excavation298 was carried out seeking to locate structures recorded by Charles Darwin in 1877.299 A probable wall of large rough greensand blocks was found, paralleled by a marked linear feature composed mostly of jumbled pieces of opus signinum , sometimes still attached to fragments of tile. This feature was apparently fringed by a series of post-holes marked out by stone and occasional tile packing, but they are probably much later in date. The greensand subsoil made identification of layers and features difficult and it is also likely that there had been considerable recent disturbance. Stone and tile robbing is suggested by the state of the wall and the opus signinum feature, the latter perhaps the result of the breaking up of a hypocaust floor to remove the tiles. This might have happened later in the Roman period, or, perhaps more likely, at some time after the site was abandoned. Finds included several minims; many fragments of painted wall-plaster, some with identifiable patterns; white, red and black tesserae, some very fine and some still held together in an opus signinum matrix; building material including all types of tile, some in an almost cream or yellow fabric; parts of a fine glass vessel; and, mostly later, Roman pottery. It is unlikely that the excavation was within the area explored in 1877 and this when combined with evidence from previous work makes it possible to be reasonably certain about the location of the rooms found then. The work also clarified some aspects of the excavations carried out in the 1990s. It is part of a programme intended to achieve publication of all earlier work at the site and to extend it, especially by re-analysis of all finds and further fieldwork devoted to the setting and function of the villa. Magnetometer survey and fieldwalking have already located probable contemporary boundary ditches. (2) Ashtead, Ashtead Common villa and tileworks (centred TQ 1775 6017): a fourth season of work has been undertaken.300 A new trench was opened as an eastward extension of the previous work at the front (south) of the villa house. Much of the area was found to have been cleared down to the level of a rammed chalk surface (seen further west in 2008), no doubt a result of A.W.G. Lowther's excavations.301 The edges of his cut followed roughly along the outer face of the corridor south wall and its return as the 'porch' east wall. The robber trenches following 297 Work by G.

The tile-based gutter had been exposed by Lowther but mostly survived in situ , with traces of rough flint walling on both sides. It was possible to examine the sequence in the area around the junction of the two walls. The chalk surface was found to cover a wide area and seems to predate all the known walls. It was covered by thin, probably occupation layers, all sealed by a thick yellow clay make-up (with inclusions of other material) for the late crushed brick corridor floor. The porch and corridor walls both had close-packed unmortared flint foundations. Above this was a faced flint wall with signs of mortar bonding and tile courses; the line of the porch wall continued north beyond the junction with the front wall to form a short spur. A large fragment of a semi-circular column tile was found in the robber trench at the junction of the two walls, which places it near the findspots of others as indicated on Lowther 's final plan. Both corridor and porch walls were set off the line of their foundation to east and south respectively. This is unlikely to be the result of slippage (particularly in both directions) so either the foundation was found to be somewhat on the wrong line when the wall proper was built or two phases are represented. A slight gap, packed in one place with oyster shells, existed between the front wall and the rough flint inner wall of the gutter, probably indicating that the gutter was a later addition. Outside the line of the porch, the gutter's outer wall had cut across the remnants of a small apsidal structure clearly matching the one found on the other side of the porch in 2008. The flint foundations of this structure were much shallower than those of the main wall. A sequence is gradually being established (including evidence from earlier trenches): grey clay (trample?) over natural; a rammed chalk floor over this probably cut by the foundations for the porch and corridor walls (if that is what they were when first built); two small attached apsidal structures now or as an addition; a probably later phase of these walls (but not the apses), associated with the higher level of the corridor floor; and finally the addition of the tile-floored gutter. There may be three different floor levels through time, represented by the chalk floor, the mortar floor seen in Room 1 1 (Trench 4), and the late corridor floor. The way in which the 'porch'-with-apses feature relates to the later villa recorded by Lowther has yet to be explained and it may well have performed a different function in an earlier building. A second main trench was placed to examine a marked anomaly found in magnetometer survey near the Roman period clay pits. A great deal of highly burnt clay and under- and over- fired, indeed vitrified, tile rubble was found, filling the much-robbed remains of a tile kiln about 3.20 m in width. This had been set in a pit cut into the natural clay, lined with tile walls of which only traces survived. The deeper central flue was better preserved and there were traces of tile features that are likely to be on the line of the front wall. Work could not be completed in the time available in this season and part of the kiln proper and its stokehole lie outside the trench. A series of smaller trenches was devoted to clarification of the extent and structure of the enclosure wall that seems to have divided the villa from the tileworks. It was traced as far as just north of the villa house but could not be followed much further south than the previously- located north-east corner. In this direction, however, a rough tiled base was found that may prove to be part of a structure related to the tileworks. The enclosure wall poses some problems of interpretation, as it has only very shallow foundations and, including those, nowhere survives above three courses of flint (with no sign of mortar) with a topping of large tegula fragments laid carefully with the flanges upwards along the outer edges of the wall. There is little sign of collapsed rubble but this cannot readily be explained by robbing. Work continues on finds from all previous work on the site. Analysis of the tiles has so far demonstrated that some products were certainly being supplied to London (I. Betts, pers. comm.). Among the finds made in 2009 was a rim sherd from a straight-sided samian bowl form Hermet 4, a most unusual find for a British site and one that should be dated to the Claudio- Neronian period (J. Bird, pers. comm.). It was probably therefore a prized possession, but does</page><page sequence="65">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2009 405 raise the possibility that some of the coarse wares could be placed in the earliest part of their date range and therefore further back into the first century than has been anticipated. (3) Chiddingfold, Roman buildings (SU 9785 3610): the Roman buildings at Whitebeech near Chiddingfold were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century. Resulting excavation revealed a complex and unusual building - currently the largest Roman building known in Surrey. The field is situated on the top of a hill with extensive views of the surrounding Weald and forms an island of better soil in the predominantly clay landscape. The plans of the excavation survive together with notes, but these give no indication of phasing nor of the exact position of the buildings within the field.302 Recent work303 has involved a topographic survey, which showed a platform cut into the hillslope. Subsequent fieldwalking on a 10 m grid showed concentrations of roof tile, pottery and tesserae on the apparent platform and a magnetometer survey has now shown that the platform is surrounded by a D-shaped ditch with further external enclosures to the south and west (fig. 18). It therefore seems likely that the Roman building occupies the platform and had been constructed within an earlier enclosure - probably of Iron Age date. The unusual plan of the building and the nature of the finds in the nineteenth century hint that the site is religious in nature,304 but this remains to be established. FIG. 18.

One area contained 25 pilae stacks belonging to a hypocaust and a doorway in the heated room above this retained a timber threshold. The sequence of clay floors in other rooms indicated two distinct phases of occupation. Fragments of painted plaster suggested a predominantly red, white and black colour scheme. Analysis is in the early stages, but suggests that the building was relatively short-lived and probably of second-century date. Four beam-slots were identified in the central courtyard forming two timber buildings, one of which appeared later than the main structure. Evidence from borehole sampling in 1982, 2008 and 2009 showed the building to be situated on an area of relatively high ground on the flood plain of the intramural branch of the Stour, currently 60 m to the east, (b) St Mildreds Tannery : the on-going watching-brief on a major residential development concentrated on the central southern (TR 1450 5760) and south-eastern (TR 1460 5760) parts of the site.307 What was probably a Roman street running roughly parallel to the intramural branch of the River Stour had been buried by an enormous dump of demolition debris, which also extended south-eastwards towards the river. The debris was chiefly of mortar and small to medium flints, but with most types of Roman tile represented along with a few Roman pottery sherds. It probably resulted from a systematic razing of buildings in the area, thought to have occurred around the end of the third century in response to repeated flooding from a rising water-table. South-east of the river, a small, truncated pit yielded much early Roman pottery and a well lined with re-used timbers was probably of Roman date, (c) 21-24 St Dunstan s Street (TR 1447 5822): evaluation prior to redevelopment uncovered two inhumation burials and human bones indicating the presence of other burials, including a possible cist burial.308 The findings corroborate earlier evidence for a cemetery on the north side of the Roman road to London, some 150 m outside the town's West Gate.309 A pit or ditch contained pottery spanning the late second to mid-third century, (d) 67-69 St Dunstan s Street (TR 1438 5814 and TR 1441 5816): evaluation trenches uncovered further information about the industrial extramural suburb on the west side of the town.310 At TR 1438 5814 large clay-extraction quarry pits were backfilled with quantities of brick and tile wasters and burnt daub indicative of industry nearby.311 A metalled street (at TR 1441 5816) was aligned parallel with St Dunstan's Street.

The investigations established the presence here of between 3 and 4 m of undisturbed, stratified deposits resting on natural river gravel. Samples of the lower sediments were recovered for palaeoenvironmental analysis318 and these should provide significant new information concerning the nature, evolution and infilling of the prehistoric and Roman harbour.

The central room was partitioned and contained a 1.2 m diameter oven base. The adjacent room contained a 450 mm diameter broken quern and two pots built into the floor. Coinage indicates that occupation continued into the late fourth century. The west end of Building 3 was investigated and was found to contain a large hearth, 1.5 m in diameter, which had at some time burnt out the interior of the west wall. This had been repaired with ragstone and opus signinum mortar. Work continues to locate other buildings.320 (6) Eastry, Farthingate (TR 3130 5470): further casual fieldwalking on the south-east facing hillslope below Eastry parish church321 revealed more Roman pottery and roof-tile fragments.

A predominance of spelt wheat from ditch and pit fills, and excavation of part of a post-built structure containing a concentration of malted spelt wheat, indicate that this farmstead may have specialised in the growing of spelt for market distribution.

At first sight it appeared that the wall fell into water or mud. A single radiocarbon date suggested that silting began in the fourteenth century, and that the wall collapse occurred afterwards. In order to clarify these issues, six trenches were excavated. The natural processes pre-dating the collapse were revealed. A sand beach lay beneath deposits of silt and gravel deposited during periods of slow water-flow. Above this was a deposit of clay laid down during a phase of marsh development within the Wantsum Channel, followed by over 1 m of colluvium that had washed down the slope over time. Erosion of the slope clearly destabilised the wall, which fell and slid down the bank of hill-wash into the silt at the base. The wall was then re-used as a waterfront in the fourteenth century. The 2.5 m depth of naturally deposited material suggests that the beach at the base of the sequence was Roman, and this was confirmed by the discovery of water-worn pottery on its surface. This work brings us closer to an understanding of the location of the Roman waterfront at the site.

Finds Reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme By SALLY WORRELL INTRODUCTION The PAS was established in 1997 as an initiative to record archaeological objects found by members of the general public and was extended to the whole of England and Wales in 2003. 1 Surveys of Roman period finds recorded by the PAS have been published in Britannia annually since 2004. This seventh report gives a brief overview of finds distribution and explores the distribution of the Bow and Fantail brooch as a case-study in the research potential of PAS data. As in previous years, descriptions of significant individual artefacts recorded by the Finds Liaison Officers then follow. OVERVIEW 66,368 artefacts were recorded on the PAS database in 2009, 19,813 (29.85 per cent) of which are Roman in date. As before, this figure includes those finds to which a date has been attributed that spans the late Iron Age and early Roman period. The 2009 data include 2,497 pot sherds, 311 tile fragments, 14 quern fragments, 70 architectural fragments, and 16,921 coins and other metallic objects (as well as 1,100 coins in 33 hoards included in the Treasure process). The total number of non-Treasure metallic finds recorded is slightly higher than that from 2008. Objects that qualify as treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 are published in the Treasure Annual Report by the British Museum and are excluded from this survey. Table 1 shows the number of Roman non-ceramic artefacts recorded on the PAS database by county and grouped by PAS region. For convenience of presentation and to enable comparison with other datasets, the Roman non-ceramic artefacts have been subdivided according to function, based on the scheme proposed by Crummy, with some modifications.2 As in previous years, the 2008 data include only a small quantity of the many artefacts recorded from Norfolk, although all records have been entered onto the Norfolk Historic Environment Record. As in previous years, coins are the most common Roman artefact recorded: the 13,537 single coin finds recorded in 2009 account for 80 per cent of all metallic finds and include 19 Greek and Roman Provincial coins.3 The total number of Roman coins recorded by PAS now stands at around 85,000. The percentage reported this year is higher than in previous years and reflects the continuing success of the initiative to record large assemblages of Roman coins in toto , including small late Roman types, known as 'grots' by detectorists. In 2009, as in previous years, the percentage of all finds accounted for by coins in each county varies. In 28 counties where more than 100 examples are recorded, coins comprise on average 81.3 per cent of all finds, but the range is quite wide: in Staffordshire coins account for 53.5 per cent of all finds, whereas in Devon they account for 99.5 per cent. In counties with high numbers of coins there is also considerable variability: in Lincolnshire they comprise 79.5 per cent of all finds, in Buckinghamshire 91 per cent, and in Warwickshire 92.8 per cent. As well as leading to the discovery of important new Roman sites, the very substantial dataset, now containing large assemblages from well-referenced 1 S. Worrell, 'Roman Britain in 2006 II.

For the most part, the quantities of artefacts grouped in other categories and the significance of different find types have remained broadly consistent with those recorded in previous years. Brooches account for 10.76 per cent of all finds recorded and other items of personal adornment 2.83 per cent. In both these categories, there are particularly high numbers from Lincolnshire and Suffolk, as before. BOW AND FANTAIL BROOCHES Using both PAS and non-PAS data, this study examines the quantity and distribution of hinged fantailed brooches.5 It demonstrates the potential of PAS data to characterise better an artefact type that occurs in reasonable numbers, but has received limited attention previously. It also offers an interesting example of a focused regional distribution of a dress accessory. FIG. 1. 1 and 3. Marton, Lines, (unpub.); 2 and 4. Hayton, East Yorks, (unpub.).

Subsequently, a very considerable quantity of similar brooches has been recorded from Lincolnshire and the surrounding counties.</page><page sequence="73">SALLY WORRELL 413 TABLE 2.

Circular plate, various - non-PAS</page><page sequence="74">4 1 4 ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2009 The brooch type, generally known as the 'Bow and Fantail' or 'Fantail' is defined by a hinged pin, a fixed headloop, short wings, which are either rounded or slightly angular (often with grooves at the end of each wing), a gently curving, narrow, rectangular-sectioned bow (often decorated with grooves parallel to each side), and a fan tail. The type has been dated to the later first to third century A.D. In the best studied subtype (Hull type 36) an expanded triangular fantail carries a Celtic broken-back scroll motif in reserved metal outlined by an enamelled field. In the variant forms, the fantail carries a variety of motifs, most commonly three enamelled triangular cells, but occasionally examples with one, two or four triangles or other motifs also occur. Similar forms include a circular or rectangular plate at the bow. Examples of this type may instead carry lozenges on the fantail. The distribution of the subtype with the fantail bearing the Celtic broken-back scroll motif (Hull type 36 - here the 'Celtic' type) has been noted as mainly occurring in the East Midlands, with outliers further north through Yorkshire, into Cumberland and as far south as Richborough.6 The PAS has added a very considerable number of new examples of most of the variants identified above. Table 2 reports the PAS finds (recorded between October 1997 and May 2010) and compares numbers to those previously known.7 There are 166 PAS finds in total, including 60 of the 'Celtic' type, 21 where the fantail carries three triangles, 19 where the brooch has a circular plate on the bow and lozenges on the fantail, and 50 with a circular plate on the bow. The new data confirm the pronounced regional focus in the distribution of the type, with a particular concentration of PAS finds in Lincolnshire, North Lincolnshire, East, North and West Yorkshire, and Nottinghamshire. In general the distribution of variant types differs little from this overall pattern. Some are more widely distributed: for example the few brooches with a rectangular plate on the bow occur from Hampshire to Northumberland. Others by contrast have a more focused distribution. A type with a circular motif on the plate on the bow, which is subdivided into six segments, resembling a wheel (one of the types amalgamated in columns 14 and 15 in Table 2), has been documented only in East and West Yorkshire. The type with a boss riveted through the centre of the circular plate is also unusual and is documented only in East Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Norfolk. Types which are less common in the overall corpus are more frequent in particular areas: for instance, examples with a circular plate on the bow, frequently also with protrusions or lugs at each side, account for a higher proportion than other variants in East Anglia. The core of the distribution fits within the areas commonly attributed to two civitates , the Corieltauvi and Parisi. The brooch type might be interpreted as a regional identity marker, but it is worth remembering that it generally occurs as single finds in larger site assemblages. Only occasionally are there instances of multiple brooches of this form occurring from the same site, for example Marton, Heckington and Thonock in Lincolnshire, Thoroton and Orston in Nottinghamshire, and Hayton in East Yorkshire, all rural settlements. The regional emphasis in this distribution may indicate shared traditions among artisans making brooches to meet a local taste. 6 J. Bay ley and S.

Hattatt did not, however, identify the same concentration, commenting that 'the type is not very common, with provenances spread over Britain from Wessex to Hadrian's Wall, with a sprinkling mainly eastwards, but showing no particular concentration other than a small majority towards the south...', R. Hattatt, Brooches of Antiquity (1987), 63. 7 The quantities of previously known examples of the variants were obtained from an extensive, but non-exhaustive review of published brooch assemblages and from unpublished material known to the author, Hayton (East Yorkshire) and Marton (Lincolnshire).</page><page sequence="75">SALLY WORRELL 415 FIG. 2.

The buckle is 97 mm long, the frame is 42.9 mm wide, and it weighs 72.8 g. It has a rectangular plate and the frame consists of two confronting dolphin heads with ears instead of crests. On its upper edge, the snouts of the two dolphins are separated by grooves, defining a central rounded knop. The grooves accommodate the twin double-fork of the tongue. The eyes of the dolphins are defined in relief by cast spirals which extend into a rib. The buckle frame has in-turned or involuted terminals. The tongue has a double-forked pin and a wide, cast loop (10.2 mm external diameter) and gradually widens and thickens before forming FIG. 3.

The tongue and frame are secured to the plate with a circular-sectioned axis bar (2.8 mm diameter), which is held in place by closed loops in opposing directions at the terminals. The rectangular plate is 66.2 mm long and is held by four hinge loops which flank the two frame loops and the central tongue loop. It has openwork decoration and an incised border with a rectangular panel containing diagonal grooves from alternating sides. At its centre is a horse, trotting to the right. Grooves on the horse define the snout, eyes, ears, mane and hooves. Above and joining the back of the horse is a pelta motif enhanced with grooved arcs, perhaps representing a stylised helmeted rider. The rear of the horse is poorly executed. On the back of the plate are four integral D-shaped lugs positioned near each corner, each with a central circular perforation used to attach the buckle to the belt. The tongue rarely survives on this buckle type but when it does, it commonly has the rear-facing projections but rarely a double pin. The axis bar with terminal loops is also difficult to parallel and may either have been a replacement or a repair. The best parallel identified for this elaborate openwork plate is a buckle plate from Argeliers in southern France of a 'Pseudo- Hispanic' dolphin belt with figurai decoration of 'Santome' type.13 'Pseudo-Hispanic' buckles are characterised by shanks on the rear for attachment to the belt; examples with perforated lugs at each corner of the plate are difficult to identify. On the Continent this type of buckle has been dated to between A.D. 350 and 380. 14 Scientific analysis using a scanning electron microscope was carried out and the average compositions were 88-90 per cent copper, 4 per cent zinc and 5 per cent tin. Minor amounts of lead, nickel and antimony were also detected. ENGLAND NOTTINGHAMSHIRE (2) Everton (SWYOR-174FC1) (fig. 4).15 A copper-alloy furniture mount in the form of a sphinx. The creature has a four-toed claw with two transverse mouldings above which the body rises with well-developed breasts and out-stretched wings. The hair is slightly waved and the circular eye settings are hollow; the other facial features are worn. There is a loop at the small of the back with a sub-rectangular bar extending above it. The base is circular and slightly irregular. FIG. 4. Everton, furniture mount in the form of a sphinx (No. 2). Scale 1:1. ( Drawn by D. Andrews; © D.

The plate is divided into two zones by narrow, flat ribs. The outer channel is decorated with finely punched SS S and the inner channel with circles on one edge and crescents on the other. At the centre a circular setting holds a convex marbled polychrome boss of dark glass with inlaid trails of yellow, white and turquoise and with a 'nipple'. The reverse of the brooch has a single semi-circular lug with the remains of a copper-alloy sprung pin. There are traces of gilding in both zones and the rear surface is coated with white metal. The external diameter is 38 mm, the diameter of the boss is 18.6 mm, the thickness of the plate is 2.1 mm, and it weighs 22.70 g.

A brooch from Osbournby, Lincolnshire (LIN-1A4334)21 (fig. 7) has a central concave setting consisting of marbled red and white glass set over a pale blue bed with a pale blue glass concave centre. The narrow rib close to the centre is decorated with small notches. It has a diameter of 24 mm and a thickness of 7 mm. LINCOLNSHIRE (4) Branston and Mere (LIN-A80353) (fig. 8).22 A life-sized, solid, dismembered copper- alloy finger, probably representing the little finger. The surviving portion of a very slightly flexed finger, oval in section, includes the carefully shaped and well defined nail, the distal phalanx and a large portion of the middle phalanx. Just before the second knuckle the finger is neatly broken. The break is well patinated suggesting that the finger may have been intentionally severed in antiquity. No other statue fragment was discovered, but the finger was found close to a probable villa site of second- to third-century date, from which, during excavation, an epitaph for a woman (Aurelia Concessa), pottery, building material and tesserae were found.23 Other bronze fingers recorded by PAS include an almost complete hand from Sutton Cheney, Leicestershire (LEIC-7F4CC3), and the tip of a finger from Offenham, Worcestershire (WMID4313). These are a not insignificant addition to the handful of examples known from excavation, such as two bronze fingers from Colchester.24 Deliberate fragmentation of statuary has been posited in other instances, for example in the case of the recently published bronze arm from London.25 FIG. 8.

The mount is 45 mm long, 31 mm at its widest point, and weighs 45.86 g. The semi-naturalistic head is solid and tapers to the nose. A ring-and-dot on either side marks the eyes, the nose is flat and the mouth is open with a small part of the tongue probably represented. The wide, inward curving horns form a large crescent and point forwards, tapering to their tips, one of which is missing. Below the horns, the wide, leaf-shaped ears have a deep concavity at the centre on the interior and are joined to the horns. Behind the head is the incomplete loop for the handle attachment. The forelimbs with knee and hoof extend below the animal's head and are depicted on either side of a countersunk circular hole, 5 mm in diameter. This forms a trapezoidal plate, probably for attachment to the bucket at which point the plate is broken. Close in form and style to this vessel mount are the pair of ox- head bucket-handle escutcheons from Felmersham, Bedfordshire (although these differ slightly in having a loop for the handle above the head and a rivet behind) and also that from Kemmeys, Newport (NMGW-DBBD23).27 FIG. 9.

It is life-like and well-proportioned; it is 51.3 mm tall, 52.7 mm long, 21 mm thick, and weighs 51.15 g. Only one leg is complete but two of the three broken legs were discovered close to the body. The head tapers to a broad, rounded nose; the horns are broken, the ears extend sideways and the eyes are deeply recessed. Lines define folds of flesh around the thick neck and the nose and eyes. Each leg terminates in a flat hoof and the position of the legs suggests that the animal was in mid-stride and leading with the right foot. Distinct wear can be seen on one face where the surface of the figurine is polished smooth and is pale yellow. Although a direct parallel for this figurine has not been found, there are similarities in the style of carving on a bone leopard knife-handle from Wroxeter and an ivory handle depicting two mating dogs from Silchester.29 26 Found by B.

Reavill and Birmingham City Council) NORTHAMPTONSHIRE (7) Near Brackley (BERK-E24C84) (figs 1 1-1 2).30 A very unusual portrait head and neck of a bearded male, cast in bronze using the lost wax technique. It is 162 mm high, has a maximum width of 115 mm, is 99 mm wide from ear to ear, and weighs 2.1 kg. The base of the neck is flat, with an external base diameter of 80-86 mm and the thickness of the base edge is 5-6 mm. The head is portrayed in a provincial style, exhibiting a fusion of classical and native traits. It has a narrow face with a low brow framed by a fringe of seven gently twisted curls. The full hair on the crown and the back of the head is cast in low relief and consists of a richly textured style of swirls of three-strand curls, with curls of six or seven strands of hair extending to the nape of the neck. The small ears (34 mm long) are not realistically rendered and depict only the lobe and outer frame. The nose is also small (32 mm long) and has a straight bridge and no nostrils. No eyebrows are depicted. The beard and moustache are extremely stylised. The terminals of the relatively long moustache curve upwards very slightly and do not join the beard. The moustache follows the line of the sketchily treated down-turned mouth which is indicated by a single groove, giving a lugubrious effect. The short, curled beard is forked, with each conical 'prong' represented by a neat twist, formed by three coils of hair. Beneath the lower jaw, additional detail on the forked beard is defined with a cold-worked, narrow single groove. Similarly striking is the treatment of the eyes. The large, almond-shaped eyes are 3 1 mm wide and are slightly slanted, framed by a moulded ridge; the pupils consist of discs of blue glass set flush to the eye's surface - there is slight damage to the glass pupil in the left eye. On the back of the head there are a small number of minor (&lt;5 mm) dents or flat areas where the detail of the hair curls appears interrupted. These are interpreted as evidence for the spacers or pins that would have pierced the wax model and connected the outer clay mould and the core. On the top H.

There is a similar corresponding dark patch on the inner surface which suggests that a small iron rod was used here as a spacer. Analysis of the metal surface was undertaken without any preparation or removal of corrosion products, using a handheld XRF spectrometer, Innov-X Systems Model Alpha 4000.31 The analytical results for the neck and base consistently clustered around the composition of 75 per cent copper, 8 per cent zinc, 8 per cent tin and 8 per cent lead, in addition to traces of iron, nickel and titanium. The corroded areas of the head and the hair yielded more variable results, typically with higher concentrations of lead, probably resulting from the precipitation of lead oxide on the patina. Unfortunately, owing to the relatively high thickness and density of the object, radiography did not reveal any further information regarding these features. The chemical composition of the blue glass settings in the eyes cannot be quantified, given that the analyses were performed in air, and thus the concentration of light compounds such as soda, silica and lime (i.e. the main constituents of Roman glass) could not be detected reliably. More significant was the detection of small concentrations of antimony and manganese, both of which are known to have been employed as glass decolorants, as well as traces of cobalt, the element responsible for the deep blue colouration of the glass. This is the sixteenth portrait-like head executed in similar provincial style currently known from Britain. This small group of bronze statuary includes heads or busts representing emperors and deities from Willingham Fen (Cambridgeshire), Duston (Northamptonshire), Felmingham Hall (Norfolk), and Icklingham (Suffolk) and the female head with almond-shaped eyes inset with black pebbles, probably from Silkstead, near Otterbourne (Hampshire).32 The small number of heads or busts cast in bronze and found in Britain share characteristics such as slanting eyes and the textured patterning of the hair, which identify them as the products of a provincial Romano-British or Gaulish workshop. The Brackley head can be dated to the mid to late second century a.D. by its resemblance to images of Antonine emperors, especially Marcus Aurelius. It may perhaps be inappropriate to suggest that the head from Brackley represents the local rendering of an imperial portrait, but a profile image on a coin portrait of Marcus Aurelius might have been its inspiration.33 (8) Pottersbury (BUC-79B4D3) (fig. 13).34 An enamelled plate-brooch cast in leaded bronze in the form of a swimming bird with an anthropomorphic head.35 The body of the brooch is a flat disc dominated by a crescentric motif in reserved metal enclosing a further crescent panel. There are traces of orange enamel surviving and an oval cell infilled with dark red, appearing black, enamel in the right side. It is very likely that a similar cell decorated the left side and perhaps also the centre, although no traces now survive. The triangular tail is decorated with rows of small transverse lines. The creature's tapering neck rises proud from the disc and is decorated with lines of punched semi-circles. The head is delineated by a pronounced chin which follows through to become the hair line.

The tail is turned back upon itself and joins the body forming a loop. In the centre of the back is an irregular sub-oval perforation which extends through the hollow pedestal. The animal stands on a ledge above the faceted pedestal. The latter is decorated on one side only with two columns of stamped pellets. Similar examples with the pin's shank extending from the dog's back are known from Kaiseraugst, Cologne, Vechten, Utrecht and London.38 (10) Northmoor (FASW-9426A5) (fig. 15).39 A well-preserved gilded disc-brooch with a cast glass central setting. The copper-alloy circular disc is divided into two zones by bold concentric ribs. The central royal blue glass setting is flat-topped and bears the boldly executed cast impression of a bird with raised wings and hooked beak which is most likely to represent an eagle. The upper surface is gilded; the outer ring has surface accretions, but it is very likely to have been decorated with 4 S '-shaped motifs. The back surface has a thin white-metal coating. The spring of four turns is mounted on a single projecting lug and the pin has an internal chord. 36 S. Worrell, 'Roman Britain in 2007. II.

The handle's shaft flares to a ledge (11.15 mm in diameter) from which a zoomorphic terminal extends in the form of a seated lion (22.8 mm high). Its front legs are straight and the head rises directly above them, turned slightly to its right. The hind quarters are rounded mouldings on each side defining the rear legs beneath which a tail is folded. A moulded collar represents the mane, defined by three circles of diagonal cross-hatched incisions on the upper back and the top of the head. A fourth row behind the ears brings the mane to the top of the head where there is also a cap of hair. On either side are two small projecting ears. The head is rounded with a squat, flattened snout. Small circular eyes project slightly and have a small central circular perforation. The shaft of the handle expands to a conical terminal with a flat base and a central circular perforation, flanked by two transverse ridges. The faces of the shaft are decorated with inlaid niello of single circumferential bands at each end and 13 or 14 rows of short diagonal lines in alternating directions, of which some are now missing the niello inlay.

The figurine has an oval head with incised oval eyes, a small nose and an incised smiling mouth. She either has an elaborate hair-style or is perhaps wearing an unusual head- dress, which frames the face, the top having a flat downwards-sloping surface. This surface is decorated with a central deep groove and to either side are opposing diagonal lines with further smaller diagonal cross-hatching between these representing braiding or the filaments of a head- dress. Around the neck of the figurine is a thick necklace or tore. The shoulders are sloping and the figurine is dressed in a draped garment with three-quarter length sleeves, the hem of which reaches to the base of the figurine. Its folds are depicted by moulded ribs and grooves which flow towards the left across the upper body of the figurine and fall vertically below the waist. The change in direction may indicate that it is belted at the waist. The left hand holds a cornucopia. The right arm is straight, held at the side of the figurine, and the right hand holds an unknown object, perhaps a young animal. There are spots of a white metal on the lower front face of the garment. At its base the hem of the garment flares outwards: here the figurine is incomplete and any pedestal or base is now missing and the feet are not visible. The underside is oval in shape and concave with traces of a possible white lead solder within it, presumably to attach the figurine to its base. There is also reddish brown iron staining around its outer edges, possibly the remains of the base or the attachment to it. The figurine probably represents Fortuna or a native goddess whose attributes draw on her iconography. The tore around her neck is similar to that of FIG. 20.

(16) Glemsford (SF-4BD264) (fig. 21).52 A very unusual and almost complete lantern; it is 306 mm in height, the body is 141 mm in diameter and the base diameter is 130 mm. It has a dome-shaped lid with simple incised decoration and possible traces of a white-metal coating and a cylindrical body comprising two uprights and a circular base plate with feet, three of which are now missing. The cylindrical surround, which would probably have been in horn, is missing. Projecting from the centre of the upper face of the lid are the remains of an applied copper-alloy loop, about half of which is still attached. To either side of this central loop there is a large oval hole, which probably acted as an air hole at the top of the lantern. The lid and body are joined by two chains approximately 155 mm long and formed from four double-strands of twisted wire joined together. At the top of the lantern there are three bars that enable suspension and attachment of the lid to the body. A split loop in copper-alloy wire runs through the hole at the base of the vertical bar and would presumably have been attached to the centre of the lid. At the centre of the base there is a circular hole and two opposing rectangular slots, presumably to enable a copper-alloy attachment with a wick to be inserted through the base and twisted through 90 degrees. Extending from the base are two opposing rectangular uprights measuring 175 mm in height, 14.60 mm in width and 9.5 mm in thickness, both of which have elaborate rectangular terminals at the top with U-shaped notches on the outer edge. Each terminal has a circular hole in the centre of the outer edge. Beneath the terminals the uprights are flattened and have transverse projecting collars. On their internal faces there are traces of flattened sheet copper-alloy plates of the same width as the uprights that presumably served to keep the horn inserts in place. A foot was attached to the base using a single cylindrical copper-alloy rivet; the second foot is larger, cruder and may have been a later addition or repair. The lantern was probably of Italian manufacture and dates to the first to third centuries A.D. It may have formed part of a funerary assemblage, probably accompanying a cremation burial, although this is at present uncertain owing to the lack of associated contextual data. It is to date the most complete lantern of its type to be found in Roman Britain, although the presence of possible fragments of similar lamps at Richborough, Fishbourne, Strageath, and possibly in Corbridge Museum is noted. Other more complete parallels are known from Torre Annunziata, Oplontis, Boscoreale, Pompeii and Tripoli, Libya.53 Whether the internal workings of the lantern are contained within the soil inside the frame may be revealed through X-rays and further conservation. Building material, pottery and other metalwork dating from the late Iron Age to the late Roman period have been found in the environs of the lantern findspot. A geophysical (magnetometer) survey of a sample 0.4 ha, including the area of the find, was undertaken as part of a student training project by the Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge. This showed traces of a series of small enclosures, possibly rooms within a building, on an alignment different to the present fields, and an indistinct area of probable building rubble. It is hoped that a larger area can be surveyed in the future. The finder and landowner have kindly donated the lantern to Ipswich Museum where it is currently being conserved. 51 M.

It is 133.5 mm long, 29.9 mm wide and weighs 382.3 g. The handle is in the form of a stylised, but well modelled, recumbent lion, which adopts a 'relaxed' pose. His four paws, indicated by three or four linear grooves, are turned forwards, the mouth is closed and the tail brought forward and flicked to the right. The full mane is neat and its strands are bunched in clusters in a similar manner to that on a key handle from Horren, Nordrhein- Westfalen.55 The facial features are unusually well-defined: the large oval eyes have a pupil and iris and the eye-brow is fully modelled. Between the brow and the mane are three stamped ring-and-dot motifs. The ears are small, the nose rounded, and the wide mouth is defined by two parallel horizontal lines. The body is decorated: rows of ring-and-dot stamps mark the junction between mane and body and accentuate the limbs on the haunches, down the legs and at the base of the tail. A saltire within a square is incised at the top of each foreleg and a triangle with a ring-and-dot at each apex is incised on both haunches. The decoration has not been paralleled on other zoomorphic key handles. The stylisation and decoration may reflect a provincial artistic tradition. The iron key of Manning's Type 256 is complete and has four close-set teeth arranged on a straight ward. Key handles in the form of a sleeping lion are relatively frequent finds in Britain, as seen at Caistor-on-Sea, Fishbourne and Caerleon, for example.57 The PAS has recorded six examples with a lion handle from Brundish, Suffolk (SF9345), Colchester, Essex (ESS-6DD2D1), FJG. 22.

The rectangular cells on each side of the frame are inlaid with black and yellow millefiori mosaic glass, a section óf which is missing from each panel. There are two studs with flattened ends projecting from the back of the plate. The object is 83 mm long, 36 mm wide, and 3 mm thick. A close parallel is known from Caerleon70 and plates linked by three-link chains for a broad leather belt found at South Shields are very similar.71 66 Worrell, op. cit. (note 36), 356-7. 67 J.

A short section of the iron blade remains (4.3 mm thick). The cylindrical body is decorated with three pairs of incised lines running along its length and punched circles arranged in regular diagonal rows spiralling around the handle. The terminal has a 'baluster' cap at the end of the cylinder containing a spring with flattened ends to secure the handle on each side. The central part of the spring curves up over the top of the end cap. The end of the iron knife tang runs through the end cap and through the central piercing on the spring where it is then hammered into a flat stop to hold both in place. Handles of Type Id knives were usually made in bone or ivory and had a wide but relatively thin distribution throughout the Western Empire. FIG. 26.

Wright in The Roman Inscriptions of Britain Vol. i (Oxford, 1965) and (slightly modified) by R.S.O. Tomlin, R.P. Wright and M.W.C. Hassall, in The Roman Inscriptions of Britain Vol. iii (Oxford, 2009), which are henceforth cited respectively as RIB I (1-2400) and III (3001-3550). Citation is by item and not page number. Inscriptions on PERSONAL BELONGINGS and the like ( instrumentupi domesticum) have been arranged alphabetically by site under their counties. For each site they have been ordered as in RIB I, pp. xiii-xiv. The items of instrumentum domesticum published in the eight fascicules of RIB II (Gloucester and Stroud, 1990-95), edited by S.S. Frere and R.S.O. Tomlin, are cited by fascicule, by the number of their category ( RIB 2401-2505) and by their sub-number within it (e.g. RIB II.2, 2415. 53). When measurements are quoted, the width precedes the height. 2 During excavation by the Department of Urban Archaeology of the Museum of London, for which see Britannia 13 (1982), 373-4. This unpublished fragment was recently discovered in the archaeological archive by the assistant curator, Glynn Davis, and Jenny Hall made it available at the Museum. 3 In line 1 , there is a semi-circular incision between S and V, but it does not appear to be deliberate; and since it has no effect on the spacing of the letters, it is probably casual like the other areas of pitting and surface damage. In line 2, only the upper portion survives of a letter which is either B, P or R, but since there is ample space after it, it must be the end of an abbreviation. In the broken edge before it there is the uncertain trace of the outward curve of another B, P or R. This raises the possibility of PR, part of the abbreviated titulature of a Roman governor (leg(atus) Aug(usti) pr(o) pr(aetore)), but the sequence -usu- is hardly ever found in Roman names ( Drusus being an exception) and it does not match any known governor. © The Author(s) 2010.

Like the inscribed slabs found just to the west at Bulmore ( RIB 359, etc.), it is apparently part of a tombstone re-used.

He also made the stone (MT 30-10-09, 002 and 003) available in Caerleon Roman Legionary Museum. 5 In line 1 , only the tip survives of the first letter, but A looks more likely than M or R. After C only the bottom of a vertical stroke survives, which in view of the letter-sequence is probably I or T. In line 2, 1 is ligatured to N. The next letter is probably Q, with its tail lost in the damage, but O is possible. The absence of any spacing makes [...Jnio Vo[...] (part of a name) or [...] ni quo[...] unlikely, but the adjective iniquus in the ablative case is an attractive reading, since it suggests the metrical tag fato ... iniquo ('by unfair fate') found in epitaphs.

The letters CH in Latin usually transliterate Greek chi, so this is likely to be part of a personal name. If it ended here, it would be feminine, either Psyche or one compounded from -tyche such as Eutyche. In line 2, only the apex survives of the first letter, but A, not M, is required by the ligatured NT which follows.

Buff sandstone altar (SF 13600), 0.49 by 1 .05 m, 0.48 m deep, found8 in 2009 still in situ , but fallen forwards, in a third-century Roman building thought to be a Dolichenum between the intervallum road and the north rampart of the visible stone fort, which it overlies immediately west of the north gate. The base is complete, but most of the capital is lost, except for part of a band of chip-carved XXX decoration. The die is recessed, with plain mouldings above and below; on the left side is carved Jupiter Dolichenus in high relief, holding an axe and a thunderbolt, standing on a bull; on the right side, a jug and patera. The front of the die, 0.42 by 0.39 m, is inscribed with six lines of well-cut letters, 42 mm high (on average), in quite good unweathered condition: I O M | DOLOCHENO | SVLPICIVS PV|DENS PRAEF | COH IUI GALL | V S L M, I(ovi) O(ptimo) FIG. 4.

It consists of a well-cut base, complete except for the lower front right corner, and a triangular portion of the die preserving part of the last three lines. On the left side of the die survives the lower part of three rounded figures carved in relief, apparently a round disc between a wreath and patera. On the front of the die, originally 0.43 m wide, the surviving text reads: [...] | [...]IVS V[2-3] | [3] PRAEFECT[..] | COH II NERVIOR, [...] I [...Jius V[...] praefect[us] ' coh(ortis) II Nervior(um).

The prefect is unattested, but can be identified with the prefect of the same cohort who dedicated RIB 1688 (Staward's Pele, four miles SSE of Vindolanda); see further below, Addenda et Corrigenda (a). The cohort is first attested at Vindolanda in A.D. 213 ( RIB 1705). 10 The dedication is lost, but in view of where the altar was found, it was presumably Jupiter Dolichenus. The approximate number of letters lost in lines 1 and 2 can be calculated from the known width of the die and the spacing of letters in 3. The prefect's cognomen undoubtedly began with V, and the spacing is appropriate to V[ictor], so it is tempting to identify him with Decimus Caerellius Victor, prefect of the same cohort, who dedicated an altar to Cocidius (RIB 1683) which was found within two miles of Vindolanda. But the nomen is lost, and other cognomina in V- would fit the space, so the identification is not certain. The right margin of line 3 is lost, but there would not have been room for VM in the cohort-title ( Nerviorum ) even if ligatured. The cohort's movements are discussed by Anthony Birley (see n. 8 above); the only other evidence for its presence at Vindolanda is a stamped tile (No. 67 below).</page><page sequence="105">446 R.S.O. TOMLIN 6. Ibid. (fig. 6). Crude altar of darkish buff sandstone (SF 13642), 0.23 by 0.42 m, 0.17 m deep, found near the two previous items. The capital and base are distinguished from the recessed die by crude mouldings extending round three sides; on its face, 0.21 by 0.10 m, is a three-line text crudely inscribed: ..EXMA | .BJ±vacat | .°VoSoLo[.]°, perhaps ..EXMA | [a]ra(m) |. v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito). '... altar, paid his vow willingly, deservedly.'11 FIG. 6. Vindolanda, altar (No. 6). (Photo: R.S.O. Tomlin) 11 Lines 1-2 are quite uncertain. The vertical score down the left margin makes it unclear how much text, if any, has been lost. At the beginning of both lines, there is a diagonal mark which if intentional would suggest 'open' A. But there are two such marks at the beginning of line 3, as if for M, which would be redundant to the V S L [M] formula that follows. So these marks might all be casual. In line 1, the mark is followed by a square outline like an inverted L; then after EX, there are three pairs of diagonal strokes appropriate to AM or MA. In line 2, after RA, the surface is too worn to tell whether M was actually inscribed; the rest of the line seems to be uninscribed. Anthony Birley (see n. 8 above) suggests the personal name A[L]EXAN|[D]RA, but N can hardly be read; alternatively he suggests [A]RA[M] in line 2, a word already found on two informal altars from Vindolanda ( RIB 1694, 3341). Except for the find-spot, there is no indication of the god concerned; the capital is too damaged to be sure that it was not inscribed.</page><page sequence="106">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2009 447 7. Ibid.

A personal name Maia is implied by the name Maianus , which is quite well attested in Gaul, and this interpretation would indicate '(property) of Maia'.

Obverse: LEGV | CTR Reverse: M°AP I VIC22 18 By metal-detector and reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme. Sally Worrell sent a photograph and other details. 19 Line 1 ends in 'open' A, but in the photograph at least it is difficult to read the two vertical strokes which precede it: the first apparently curves at the top, and may even be C; the second lacks the firm cross-bar of T in line 2, and is probably I. To the left of them, at the broken edge, is a dark discoloration which is probably the tip of another letter. The number of letters lost is deduced from the likely restoration of line 2, given that its lettering seems to be closer-spaced. At all events, -ia is a nominative feminine singular ending (since the 3rd-person singular verbal ending in line 2 excludes a neuter plural), and thus terminates an abstract noun or a woman's name. There seems to be no exact parallel for this invocation, but compare CIL xiii 10024.80 (copper-alloy ring), veni vita ('come, my life'); and for Britain, RIB II.3, 2422.61 and Britannia 38 (2007), 351, Ño. 8, two copper-alloy rings inscribed veni ('come') ... (etc.). 20 By metal-detector, as reported by the finder to Adam Daubney (see n. 30 below), in whose catalogue it is No. 45. 21 By metal-detector and reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme. Sally Worrell sent a drawing and other details. In form and content this sealing is difficult, but is best explained as a blundered reference to the Sixth Legion, which was stationed nearby at York. Unusually for a legionary sealing, it is oval, not rectangular. At first sight the obverse (line 1) names the Fifth Legion, but this was only stationed on the lower Rhine until A.D. 69, and was apparently destroyed soon afterwards. One of its sealings at such an early date in northern Britain is inherently unlikely, especially since the other military sealings found here derive from the British garrison. Both CTR and MAP are easily understood as the abbreviated name of an officer, whether reduced to three initials or two, if the 'medial point' in MAP is intentional, but it is strange that two officers should be named. However, VIC (reverse, line 2) with its barred VI is apparently a conflation between the Sixth Legion's numeral (VI) and its cognomen (VIC for Vic(trix )), which suggests that CTR may be a reminiscence of Victrix ; and furthermore, that the puzzling V on the obverse (line 1) is not '5' at all, but a conflation between V(ictrix) and VI ('6').</page><page sequence="110">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2009 45 1 FIG. 12.

The penultimate letter does not curve enough for C, but can hardly be anything else, placed as it is between two long downstrokes each of which must be I. The name Criticus is uniquely attested (CIL xiii 5783), but some trace of initial C would be expected here; the graffito is apparently complete, but there is not enough space either side to be quite sure. The name *Riticus or *Riticius is apparently unattested, but might be a variant of Retiens (CIL iii 11968) or Reticius (bishop of Autun in a.D. 314, whose name is transmitted by Gregory of Tours as Riticius ); see Holder, s.v.</page><page sequence="119">460 R.S.O.

The obverse and reverse legends and the surrounding figures are the same as those on five of the group of twelve bone roundels found at Toppings Wharf, Bermondsey (RIB II.3, 2440.123-7). The sixth (ibid., 128) reads SEIXTIII | RVFINVS, and three others (ibid., 129-3 1) read SEXTI with the reverse blank. The remaining two are blank (see Britannia 3 (1972), 358, fig. 21). The association of SEXTIII with SEXTI suggests that the final II is a numeral ('2') rather than 'E', especially since a feminine reading (Sex ti (a) e ' Iuni(a)e , whether genitive or plural) would be difficult anyway. Perhaps this numeral differentiated the gaming-counter 's rank: according to Isidorus (Orig. 18. 67), the counters ( calculi ) which moved in a game of latrunculi ('bandits') were divided between those which could only move straight (ordine) and those which could move in more than one direction (vagi). The victory-symbolism (palm-branch and wreath), and the figures of a gladiator on one Bermondsey roundel (RIB II.3, 2440.124) and a beast on another (ibid., 128), may allude to combats in the arena, but the significance of Iunii and Sextii is unknown.</page><page sequence="120">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2009 46 1 NORTHUMBERLAND 65.

Three at least can be identified as RIB ÍI.4, 2460.50 (Wright, type 44). 44 During excavation for the Vindolanda Trust directed by Andrew Birley. Robin Birley made it and the next seven items available with note of provenance. Small-find (SF) numbers are given in brackets. 45 It was first interpreted as part of a perpetual calendar, with two days to a hole, by Andrew Birley in Archaeology 62.1 (Jan./Feb. 2009), 72; see also Current Archaeology 224 (Nov. 2008), 14-15, and Robin Birley, Vindolanda: a Roman Frontier Fort on Hadrian's Wall (2009), col. pl. 23. But Michael Lewis has argued persuasively in Current Archaeology 228 (March'2009), 12-17, that it is part of an 'anaphoric' water-clock as described by Vitruvius (9. 8. 8-15); see also M. Lewis in O. Wikander (ed.), Handbook of Ancient Water Technology (2000), 361-9, and esp. 366. The clock's function was to divide day and night into 12 equal hours each according to the Roman system, whatever the latitude or time of year, by means of a disc which rotated once every 24 hours against a fixed grid. This disc had holes around the circumference which was marked with the months, like the Salzburg fragment ( ILS 8645), and the date was marked by means of a peg. As it rotated, therefore, the peg marked the angle of the sun against the grid somewhat like a sun-dial, but working day and night. Since Roman hours of day and night varied in length according to the time of year, the equinox is marked because it was the only 24-hour period (twice a year) in which all 24 hours were of equal length. Time-keeping by the hour would have been essential to the fort's daily routine: Vegetius notes (3. 8) that the night was divided into four watches of three hours each 'by the water-clock' (ad clepsydram), and there are hints of such a system in military papyri which refer to 'the second watch' (vigiliam ii, in Fink RMR 67) and 'the ninth hour' (hora illa non[a] and hora viiii principia [...], in Fink RMR 53). At the fort of Remagen in a.d. 218, the prefect even paid for 'the clock' (horolegium) to be repaired (ILS 9363). With the next six items. Except for No. 68 (SF 12236), which was found in the via principalis in front of the west granary, they were all found in fourth-century 'chalet' barracks, where they must have been residual.</page><page sequence="121">462 R.S.O.

N is reversed. There is no evidence of how far the title Nerviorum was actually abbreviated. Auxiliary tile-stamps are comparatively uncommon (see RIB II.4, 2464-2480), and only three units are known to have abbreviated cohors to C, but in each case (ibid., 2468, 2469, 2471) with a medial point, which is not the case here. For this cohort at Vindolanda, some time in the second century, see No. 5 above (Vindolanda) with note. The stamp is otherwise unknown. 49 The graffito is incomplete, since the cut edge of another letter shows in the break. The first letter might be read as P, since the diagonal does not extend to the next down-stroke, but there is a little evidence for the nomen Ninius (for example CIL vi 22986, 22987), which was perhaps cognate with the Celtic name Ninnos. 50 This is difficult to interpret as a numeral, but to read upwards, MII[. . .], is also difficult.</page><page sequence="122">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2009 463 71.

Since the graffito is vertically aligned to the left cut edge, the weight must relate to the hacksilber itself and not to the original piece of silver plate. Conceivably it is the weight of several pieces of hacksilber tied together, but this possibility should be rejected in view of the actual weight of 163.26 gm, which is exactly one half-pound, a semis (regularly abbreviated to 5).

Information from Philip de Jersey, who made the sherds available. 63 Although broken to the left, the graffito is probably complete, with V ligatured to 'open* A. The reading [JMT is just possible, with incomplete M; this would be the name of a Roman citizen reduced to its three initials, but it seems most unlikely. For other examples of the abbreviation VAT, see RIB II. 7, 2501.573 (London) and II.8, 2503.598 (Old Winteringham). Possible names are all rare; in Britain they include Vatta ( RIB 610) and Vatiaucus ( RIB II.3, 2432.4). 64 There is a space between the first letter and the second, and a possible difference in alignment (but not in the instrument used), to judge by the second and third letters. The third letter is a downstroke broken at the top, and is therefore incomplete; it might be II = E, or even N (etc.), rather than I. A note of capacity expressed in two units seems unlikely, but the graffito is too fragmentary to decide between the possibilities of two ownership inscriptions, the first in the genitive case, or of one by a man with two names such as [IVL]I VI[IRI].</page><page sequence="126">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2009 467 SCOTLAND CITY OF EDINBURGH 87. Cramond (NT 1900 7688). Base sherd of a samian dish (Drag. 18/31) stamped by Reditus of Lezoux (c. a.D. 135-65) (SF 107), found65 in 2008. Scratched underneath after firing in capital letters: VIIR, an abbreviated personal name Ver (...), perhaps Ver(ecundus).66 ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA (a) RIB 1688 (Vindolanda). This altar is now so weathered as to be illegible, but with the help of No. 4 above (Vindolanda) the prefect's name can be read from Wright's (1950) drawing as [SV]LPI|CIVS PVDENS, [Su]lpi'cius Pudens.61 It was preceded in line 3 by the cui praeest formula abbreviated; the drawing suggests [C] P[R]AE. (b) RIB 1705 (Vindolanda) (fig. 37). Two fragments of a buff sandstone dedication-slab were found68 in 2009 at Vindolanda, in the east granary of the visible stone fort. They almost certainly belong to the same inscription as a much larger fragment (RIB 1705) found at Vindolanda in 1933, re-used in the Headquarters Building immediately to the east. Fragment (i), 205 by 145 mm, 115 mm thick, with original top edge, right edge _and back, is inscribed in letters 60 mm high which retain trace of red paint: [...]$EVERI | [...]I ÇÎMXI | [...], [...] Severi ' [... Parth] FIG. 37. Vindolanda, RIB 1705 (Add. (b), (i)). ( Photo : R.S.O. Tomlin) 65 During excavation by AOC Archaeology Group (project no. 20137). Information from Alex Croom, who sent a drawing. 66 The abbreviation VIIR is quite frequent: it occurs on samian sherds from Richborough ( RIB II. 7, 2501.598), Leicester (584), Lancaster (8 1 6) and Corbridge (8 1 7). The name would probably have been Roman in appearance, but have 'concealed' the Celtic name-element *vero-s ('true'). There are many possibilities, but the most likely are Verus, Verinus and Verecundus. Since the first two were hardly worth abbreviating, Verecundus seems likely. 67 As suggested by Robin Birley; the altar was re-examined in 2009 by Anthony Birley (see n. 8 above). 68 During excavation for the Vindolanda Trust directed by Andrew Birley. Robin Birley made them available, with a note by Anthony Birley which makes the connection with RIB 1705, although his readings differ slightly from those offered here. None of the fragments conjoin, but (i) is the same thickness as RIB 1705 [414 in. = 115 mm], its lettering is similar (but slightly taller, as appropriate to the first two lines), and like RIB 1705 when found, it retains traces of red paint. Independently of RIB 1705, both fragments can be dated to the sole reign of Caracalla, besides being found in the adjoining building. The text as restored by RIB should therefore be expanded by inserting his elaborate 'ancestry', details of which are given by RIB 1202 (Whitley Castle), 1235 (Risingham), etc.</page><page sequence="127">468 R.S.O.

It evidently identified Caracalla as the son of the deified Severus, Most Great Conqueror of Parthia (etc.).69 Fragment (ii), 80 by 115 mm, maximum thickness 60 mm (but not original), is inscribed in similar letters 50 mm high without trace of colouring: [ ] | [ - ] ANI[...] I [...]Isfep[...] I [...], part of Caracalla's fictive ancestry.70 (c) After RIB II.3, 2422.40, note is made of an unprovenanced gold TOT finger-ring which is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In addition to RIB II.3, 2422.38 (British Museum), six silver TOT rings without provenance have also been recorded (fig. 38).71 FIG. 38. Unprovenanced silver finger-ring (Add.

This fragment of a copper-alloy belt- plate, originally read as [IO] VIS after RIB II.3, 2429.11 (Brampton), is now better read and restored as [serjves.12 'May you preserve.' (e) RIB II.3, 2429.12 (Kirkby Thore). This fragment of a copper-alloy belt-plate, reading SERV.[...], is better restored as serv[es]P 'May you preserve.' / 69 The broken edge to the left preserves the middle of S in line 1 , and the tips of I (ligatured to H or N) and of C in line 2. Next, I was ligatured to M, although this began the next word; and A (with its cross-bar now lost) was ligatured within M. The adjective maximus ('greatest'), here probably abbreviated to maxi(mi) as in RIB 1705, line 2, was only added to the last two of Severus' titles, Parthicus and Britanniens . Either could be restored here, but Parthicus would allow more space in the line for all the preceding titles (Pius, perhaps Pertinax , Aug(ustus), Arabicus and Adiabenicus ), which were themselves probably abbreviated. 70 It is too small to be located exactly. Line 1 is either part of Germanici for his 'grandfather' Marcus Aurelius, or the end of Hadriani (his 'great-great-grandfather') or Traiani (his 'great-great-great-grandfather'). Line 2 likewise is either the beginning of Ner[vae] (his 'great-great-great-great-grandfather' and ultimate ancestor), or part of abnepoti ('great-great- grandson') or adnepoti ('great-great-great-grandson'). In view of the likely line-width, nepoti ('grandson') and pronepoti ('great-grandson') may be eliminated. 71 By Adam Daubney (see n. 30 above), in whose catalogue they are D 47, 49, 50, 5 1 , 52 and 68. A seventh ring (D 64) is thought not to be from Britain. 72 By Paul Bidwell (as reported by Alex Croom), who reads the penultimate letter as E, not I, because of its three rightward extensions; he compares a complete example from the fort of Eining, which reads SERVES (M. Gschwind, Abusina: das römische Auxiliarkastell Eining an der Donau vom 1. bis 5. Jahrhundert n. Chr. (Munich, 2004), 329, C 383 with fig. 46). The complete legend is unknown, but is surely related to the baldric- and belt-fittings which read (in effect) Iuppiter Optime Maxime conserva numerum omnium militantium ( RIB II.3, 2429, with L. Allason-Jones, 'An eagle mount from Carlisle', Saalburg Jahrbuch 42 (1986), 68-9). The genitive 'of Jupiter' ( lovis ) and the jussive subjunctive (serves) suggests that a prayer for protection is being addressed in respectful terms to an attribute of Jupiter, perhaps his eagle with thunderbolt (compare RIB II.3, 2429.1-6, etc.) or his son, the hero Hercules. 73 Compare the previous item (with note).</page><page sequence="128">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2009 469 (f) RIB II.4, 2472.2, tile-stamp reading C IUI G, c(ohors) III I G(allorum). Examples noted are all from Templebrough, but the same stamp was used for two roof-tiles ( tegulae ) found at Castleford ( Lagentium ). Since they are in the same fabric as the majority of tile from this fort and its vicus , this fabric was probably local; it would follow that in the Flavian period the cohort was stationed at Castleford.74 (g) RIB III has now been published, and brings the record of inscriptions on stone in RIB I to the end of 2006.

The indispensable assistance of many museums and individuals is acknowledged in the Preface and on p. 5. 76 54 High Street, Barkway. A previous owner worked for Sotheby's during c. 1965/85 (information from William MacKay, FSA), and presumably acquired the fragment when the Lowther Castle collection was dispersed in 1970. See further Sotheby's (London) Sale of Antiquities, Monday 29 June 1970. Lots 167-82 are 'The Property of the Rt. Hon. The Earl of Lonsdale', and the second item (of two) in Lot 180 is 'a fragment of a Roman yellow sandstone Altar carved with half an arch enclosing a brief inscription, a fruit and swag to one side, 203/4 in. high (52.7 cm.) by 28% in. wide (7 1 .7 cm.)'.
