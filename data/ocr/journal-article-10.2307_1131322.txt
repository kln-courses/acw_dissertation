CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1993, 64, 982-1004. By applying the principles and methods of mechanics to the musculoskeletal system, new insights can be discovered about control of human limb dynamics both in adults and infants. Here, we first provide a basic primer about biome- chanics-its historical context, terminology, and analytical techniques. Next we review research with animals and human adults that illustrates how limb dynamics provides a window for examin- ing the physical mechanisms underlying neuromotor control. Finally, we elaborate on how our research group has adapted dynamics techniques to investigate how infants gain control of their limbs and learn to reach in the first year of life. During the past 2 decades, exciting de- velopments have occurred in the overlap- ping areas of biomechanics and neuromotor control. There has been a strong and perva- sive emphasis on integrative and multidisci- plinary research leading toward a better un- derstanding of the mechanisms responsible for the control of movements. In like man- ner, Thelen et al. (1992) suggest that recent applications of biomechanical methods and motor control principles to the study of in- fant and child motor behavior have fueled a resurgent interest in motor development (Bloch &amp; Bertenthal, 1990; Kelso &amp; Clark, 1982; Pick, 1989; Thelen, 1989; Woollacott &amp; Shumway-Cook, 1989). Pick (1989) states that trying to understand the "control of functional behavior" or the "control of ac- tion" (Bernstein, 1967; Gibson, 1979) has become a prime focus for current motor- development research. In this paper, we first provide a brief historical context and basic primer about biomechanics and biomechanical techniques for studying human movement. Second, we review research with adults to illustrate how knowledge of upper-extremity limb dynam- ics has given insight into underlying mecha- nisms for controlling movements (Schnei- der &amp; Zernicke, 1989; Schneider, Zernicke, Schmidt, &amp; Hart, 1989). In the final portion of this paper, we elaborate on how our re- search group has adapted and extended bio- mechanical techniques to investigate how infants gain control of their limbs and learn to reach in the first year of life (Thelen et al., 1992; Thelen et al., 1993, in this issue). Historical Context for Biomechanics Biomechanics is the application of the principles and methods of mechanics to the study of biological systems. Others provide variations on this generic definition by stat- ing that biomechanics is "anything directly or indirectly pertaining to the effects of forces upon the form or motion of organic bodies or tissues" (Evans, 1971) and "the science which investigates the effect of in- ternal and external forces on human and ani- Portions of the research reported here have been supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (HD 22830 and NS 19864).

The roots of biomechanics go deep into history, but the term biomechanics was first coined by Bernstein (1923) and, apparently, first used in the English literature by Gratz (1936). Much earlier, however, Galileo first referred to a science of"mechanics" (Singer, 1959), and Borelli, an Italian physician, mathematician, and astronomer, developed the theory that human and animal muscu- loskeletal systems comprised a complex arrangement of levers and that muscles functioned according to mathematical prin- ciples (Rasch &amp; Burke, 1974). Borelli's classical work, De motu animalium (The motion of animals, 1680) established him as the founder of the field of biomechanics (Dempster, 1961), but Borelli predated the development of the branch of physics that would allow the quantitative-rather than descriptive-analysis of motion. The emergence of the "physics of mo- tion" occurred near the start of the seven- teenth century, as science "took off" (Bro- nowski, 1978). In addition to the major impact of Newton's Principia (Cajori, 1729/ 1946), rigid-body mechanics became a ma- ture science during the seventeenth century (Serret, 1888-1889). Dempster (1961) notes that many principles related to the motion of bodies were developed at that time, includ- ing the dynamics of particles and rigid bod- ies, the moment of inertia, and D'Alembert's dynamic equilibrium (D'Alembert, 1758). Not until the eighteenth century, however, did researchers begin to apply these new principles of mechanics to human move- ment analyses (Weber &amp; Weber, 1836). Then with the development by Muybridge and Marey of photographic and cine techniques to "capture" human and animal motion (Haas, 1976; Marey, 1894; Muybridge, 1955, 1957), for the first time there were tech- niques available to quantify time-sequenced movements. In Germany, Braune and Fischer combined Newtonian mechanics and the photographic recording of body seg- mental positions to produce pioneering studies of human locomotion (Braune &amp; Fischer, 1889; Fischer, 1895-1904). But perhaps most important, at the be- ginning of the twentieth century, Nicolai Bernstein directed the innovative and pio- neering research at the Central Institute of Work in Moscow. Because Bernstein's re- search was published in Russian, it did not make an immediate worldwide impact until his classical work, Co-ordination and Regu- lation of Movements, appeared in English in 1967. Since that time, Bernstein's per- spectives on biodynamics have had a dra- matic impact, not only in the field of bio- mechanics but also in motor control and, more recently, in motor development. In the context of human movement analyses, Bern- stein was the first to articulate the concepts of degrees offreedom, peripheral indetermi- nacy (context-conditioned sensitivity), and functional synergies (coordinative structure) (Kelso, 1982)-for greater elaboration of Bernstein's concepts, a coherent and concise tutorial has been published by Turvey and colleagues (Fitch, Tuller, &amp; Turvey, 1982; Tuller, Fitch, &amp; Turvey, 1982; Turvey, Fitch, &amp; Tuller, 1982). Bernstein realized that understanding movement coordination was not accom- plished by simply analyzing how individual muscles generated limb movements. Rather, during movements, the multiple, intercon- nected links of the human body were af- fected by external forces (e.g., gravity or con- tact forces), as well as motion-dependent forces generated by the moving body seg- ments (inertial, centripetal, and Coriolis forces)-for example, movement of your hand will generate "motion-dependent" forces at your elbow and shoulder. One of Bernstein's tenets in motor learning and development is that movement patterns emerge through dynamic and sym- biotic interactions between the organism and the environment-movement forms are not imposed on the organism by an autono- mously maturing brain but are blended into the neuromuscular system via interactions with external feedback and forces (Thelen et al., 1992). Movement regulation is a dynamic process in which adaptive and functional strategies (synergies) are developed to re- duce the complexity of motor control (Gel- fand, Gurfinkel, Tsetlin, &amp; Shik, 1971). In Bernstein's perspective, infant motor devel- opment is viewed as a dynamic process, in which functional synergies are formed in the context of changing environmental and in- ternal forces to simplify control by reducing the number of parameters (degrees of free- dom) that need to be coordinated. Biomechanics Terminology Before venturing further, however, it will be useful to review some of the terms used in biomechanics. The same terms used in basic mechanics are also applied to bio-</page><page sequence="3">984 Child Development mechanics. Mechanics is the branch of phys- ics that deals with the motions or states of material bodies, and mechanics is typically divided into kinematics (dealing with differ- ent forms of motion) and dynamics (dealing with the physical causes for changes in mo- tion). Dynamics is subdivided into two parts, statics and kinetics. Statics involves systems that are in equilibrium-forces acting on the body or system are balanced (Fung, 1990), and the body is at rest or moving at a con- stant velocity (zero acceleration). Kinetics deals with changes in motion caused by one or more unbalanced forces (Winter, 1990). When using biomechanical analyses to probe the control mechanisms underlying movement, it is important to recognize a ba- sic difference between kinematics and dy- namics. Kinematic variables describe or characterize the movement-the effect; whereas dynamics variables quantify the un- derlying physical cause of the movement. Note, in this paper dynamics is used in a more restricted, biomechanical sense and not in the more general sense of "dynamical systems" (Haken, 1977; Kelso, Tuller, &amp; Harris, 1983; Kugler, Kelso, &amp; Turvey, 1982; Kugler &amp; Turvey, 1987; Maxwell, 1877; Pri- gogine, 1980; Thelen, Kelso, &amp; Fogel, 1987). Kinematic variables include linear and angular position, velocity (time derivative of position), acceleration (time derivative of ve- locity), and jerk (time derivative of accelera- tion) of body segments or joints. During movements such as walking or reaching for an object, kinematic analysis of joint angles or joint angular velocities can be synchro- nized temporally with electromyographic re- cordings of synergistic muscles to give an extensive description of the movement. Dynamics Methods The primary variables of dynamics anal- yses include force, torque, and power. Force is a vector quantity; and thus it has magni- tude and direction and is calculated as the product of the mass of a body (object) and its linear acceleration--Newton's Second Law, F = m ? a (Fung, 1990; Likins, 1973). (Note, vectors are in bold type.) In human move- ment kinetics, forces can be either internal or external. Internal forces can be generated either actively or passively by skeletal mus- cles, and passively by ligaments, periarticu- lar structures, and friction in joints. External forces are applied to the body at contact points (e.g., ground forces on the foot during walking), by objects being lifted or making contact with the body, or by passive sources such as wind resistance (Winter, 1990). Because the human musculoskeletal system is a complex system of levers, body segments have a tendency to rotate about joint axes as internal or external forces are applied. The tendency to cause that rotation is quantified by determining the torque (also called a moment) applied to the segment. Torque (M) also is a vector and is calculated as the applied force (F) times the perpendic- ular distance (r) between the line of action of the force and the joint axis of rotation, M = F x r (Fung, 1990). The units of torque (N - m), therefore, are associated with the units of force (N) and distance (m). By knowing the magnitude and sign of the muscular torque (M) being produced at a joint and that joint's angular velocity (w), joint muscle power (M ? W) can be deter- mined (Winter, 1990). Joint muscle power reveals whether mechanical power is being generated or absorbed by the muscles cross- ing a joint. Power is generated at a joint when M and w are both positive or when both are negative. Power is absorbed at a joint when the product of M and w is a nega- tive value, M - (- o) or (- M) ? w. For exam- ple, power generation will occur at the el- bow, if there is a flexor torque (- M) while the elbow is flexing (decreasing elbow angle produces - o), and power absorption will occur at the elbow, if there is a flexor torque (- M) while the elbow is extending (increas- ing elbow angle produces w). If a muscle shortens when it is activated, that is a con- centric contraction, but if a muscle length- ens while it is activated (e.g., forcibly stretching an active muscle), that is an eccen- tric muscle contraction. In a generic sense, muscle power generation is related to con- centric muscle contraction, and muscle power absorption is related to eccentric con- traction. When analyzing the dynamics of the hu- man body, generally the segments of the body are approximated as rigid bodies or in- terconnected links (Bernstein, 1967; Demp- ster, 1961). Although deformations of soft tissues can occur during movement, soft- tissue deformations are small compared to the large excursions of the total limb. Ac- cepting that limitation, researchers then have a tractable problem, and rigid-body equations of motion can be used to quantify limb dynamics. To do a rigid-body analysis of a limb's dynamics, a free-body diagram is first con- structed, isolating the segment (link) of in- terest with all the external applied forces drawn on the diagram (Likins, 1973). In the</page><page sequence="4">Zernicke and Schneider 985 upper portion of Figure 1, we show a sche- matic of an infant's upper extremity, con- sisting of three segments (S1, hand; S2, fore- arm; and S3, upper arm) connected by "frictionless" joints (J1, wrist; J2, elbow; and J3, shoulder). Previously we published the mathematical details and equations of mo- tion for this three-segment model (Schnei- der &amp; Zernicke, 1990), and, thus, here we only present the basic elements of the model we have used to study both adult and infant limb dynamics. The three-segment upper extremity moves in an inertial reference frame (X - Y - Z) that is oriented with respect to gravity, acting in the vertical direction (Fig. 1). We record the three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) of the wrist (J1), elbow (J2), and shoul- der (J3) and-at each instant in time- compute a "moving-local plane" (P) that al- ways contains the coordinates of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder (J1, J2, J3). In the mov- ing-local plane, free-body diagrams are con- structed, as illustrated in the lower portion of Figure 1. For each of the three segments, there is a force related to each segment's weight (W1, W2, W3) acting through each seg- ment's center of mass, and at each joint, there are equal and opposite joint reaction forces (F1, F2, F3). For example at the wrist joint, F1 is the joint reaction force of the hand acting on the distal end of the forearm segment, while -F1 is the equal and oppo- ++ ZZ3 ZZ2 1 S3 J3 z S2 MJ2 F3 Y FF -F3 Fg 2"M3 W1 -F1 W2 F2 FIG. 1.-Interpretive and free-body diagrams of a model of an infant's upper extremity. The upper diagram shows the limb positioned in an inertial (X - Y - Z) coordinate system with a positive torque defined (M). The upper extremity is modeled as three interconnected rigid segments (S1 hand, S2 forearm, and S3 upper arm) with frictionless joints (J1 wrist, J2 elbow, and J3 shoulder). At each instant in time during a reach, a moving local plane (P) is calculated so that the plane contains the x, y, z coordinates of each of the three joint centers (J1, J2, J3). The planar torques at the wrist, elbow, and shoulder are calculated with respect to the respective joint axes (Zi, Z', Z') that pass through each joint and are perpendicular to the moving local plane (P). In the lower portion of the figure is a free-body diagram of the upper extremity. Depicted are forces related to the hand, forearm, and upper-arm segment weights (W1, W2, W3) acting their respective center of mass, and the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joint reaction forces (F1, F2, F3) and torques (M1, M2, M3).</page><page sequence="5">986 Child Development site effect of the forearm acting on the hand. The torques (M1 wrist, M2 elbow, and M3 shoulder) are computed with respect to axes Z ', ZS, Z', which pass through the three joints and are perpendicular to the moving- local plane (P). The advantage of computing the torques in a moving local plane is that a planar (two-dimensional) dynamics analysis can be used to gain insights into motor con- trol without resorting to the complexity of a full-fledged three-dimensional dynamics analysis. After free body diagrams are con- structed, equations of motion can be written (e.g., Hoy &amp; Zernicke, 1986; Schneider &amp; Zernicke, 1990; Schneider, Zernicke, Ul- rich, Jensen, &amp; Thelen, 1990; Wisleder, Zer- nicke, &amp; Smith, 1990). If a body is undergo- ing acceleration as a result of an applied force, then as indicated in Newton's Second Law, the force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration (F = m - a). Using D'Alembert's principle (D'Alembert, 1758), Newton's equation can be rewritten as F + (-m - a) = 0, such that (-m - a) is an inertial force that balances the external force, F. Thus, the system is in dynamic equilibrium. The analogous relation for dynamic equilib- rium for the torques is M + (-I - a) = 0, where I is the moment of inertia, and a is the angular acceleration of the segment. The above description, however, is for a simple case of a single external force and an inertial force, whereas the human body is an interconnected set of several rigid bodies. The complex, multijoint nature of normal human movement means that dynamics re- sults are not intuitively obvious, because there is no simple relation between the dy- namics and kinematics of individual seg- ments. For example, the angular accelera- tion of the shoulder joint depends not only on torques developed by shoulder muscles but also on accelerations and angular veloci- ties of more distal segments-the forearm and hand (Soechting &amp; Flanders, 1991). Knowing whether the shoulder (or any other joint) is moving or not (kinematic informa- tion) does not give us direct information about the underlying kinetics. Because the shoulder is flexing, for example, does not tell us whether there is a flexor muscle torque or an extensor muscle torque acting at the shoulder; the muscle torque (flexor) could be acting concentrically, or the muscle torque (extensor) could be acting eccentri- cally during the shoulder flexion. These are very different conditions of motor control, and it is a dynamics analysis that will reveal those differences. To conduct a dynamics analysis, one can find the mathematical derivations of rigid- body equations of motion detailed in sev- eral reports (Bresler &amp; Frankel, 1950; Hoy &amp; Zernicke, 1985, 1986; Hoy, Zernicke, &amp; Smith, 1985; Schneider &amp; Zernicke, 1990; Schneider et al., 1989, 1990; Winter, 1990; Wisleder et al., 1990; Zajac &amp; Gordon, 1989). These approaches use inverse dynamics to quantify movement kinetics, and inverse dy- namics has provided a window for examin- ing the mechanisms by which intersegmen- tal torques influence limb trajectories during pointing and reaching tasks (Atkeson &amp; Hollerbach, 1985; Lacquaniti &amp; Soechting, 1982), the swing phase of human walking (Mena, Mansour, &amp; Simon, 1981; Putnam, 1991; Zernicke, Schneider, &amp; Buford, 1991), running (Phillips, Roberts, &amp; Huang, 1983; Putnam, 1991; Zernicke et al., 1991) and kicking (Putnam, 1983), the swing phase of cat locomotion (Hoy &amp; Zernicke, 1985; Wisleder et al., 1990), and the cat paw-shake (Hoy &amp; Zernicke, 1986; Hoy et al., 1985; Smith &amp; Zernicke, 1987). With the inverse dynamics approach, the recorded position-time data (kinematics) of the segments are double differentiated with respect to time to provide estimates of the linear and angular accelerations of the segments to be used in the calculations of the forces and torques. This approach is used because it is generally possible to ob- tain segmental position-time data using high-speed video, cine film, or optoelec- tronic tracking devices. The converse of the inverse dynamics approach is a forward solu- tion or synthesis (Winter, 1990). With a for- ward solution, the forces and torques (dy- namics) are known and are used as input to a model to determine the resulting motion (kinematics). Although synthesis has great potential, its current utility is severely lim- ited because valid, direct estimates of mus- cle forces or joint torques are difficult to obtain. Inverse-dynamics equations of motion can be formulated in several ways, but the form we use allows quantification not only of how muscles and gravity influence limb motion, but also of how the motion of one segment affects other segments (limb inter- segmental dynamics). For example, hand motions can produce torques at the shoulder or elbow at the same time that upper arm motions generate torques at the wrist and</page><page sequence="6">Zernicke and Schneider 987 elbow-even if a given segment is not ex- posed to local muscle forces. Some of the new insights that limb dynamics can provide into neural control mechanisms are apparent in studies of the rapid limb oscillations in a paw-shake re- sponse (Hoy &amp; Zernicke, 1986; Hoy et al., 1985; Smith &amp; Zernicke, 1987). The paw- shake response is a rapid and stereotypic pattern of cyclic hip, knee, and ankle mo- tions that a cat uses to remove an irritant, such as water or tape, from its paw. A key finding from these paw-shake dynamics analyses is that ankle muscles produce torques to control the paw dynamics directly, but the knee muscles produce torques to control the motion-dependent torques between the paw and lower leg (Hoy &amp; Zernicke, 1986; Hoy et al., 1985). Before these dynamics analyses, no data ever suggested that during this movement the ankle and knee were differentially con- trolled (Smith &amp; Zernicke, 1987). As Smith and Zernicke (1987) note, such knowledge of limb dynamics and joint torques can gen- erate unique predictions about the neural mechanisms responsible for the control of limb motions; for example, one can readily test whether, during the paw-shake re- sponse, peripheral feedback will be impor- tant at the knee but not at the ankle (Hart, Cox, Hoy, Smith, &amp; Zernicke, 1987; Sabin &amp; Smith, 1984). In addition, our group (Schneider et al., 1990) has begun to use inverse dynamics to study stereotypic kicking in supine 3-month- old infants. The dynamics were calculated for active and passive forces during kicks of varying intensity, ranging from nonvigorous to vigorous. In nonvigorous kicks, the rever- sal at the hip joint was primarily a result of gravity acting on the limb and being op- posed by a hip-muscle flexor torque and flexor torques generated by forces generated between the segments of the limb (motion- dependent torques). At the hip reversal in vigorous kicks, however, an extensor muscle torque was needed to counteract the flexor effect of the motion-dependent torque, and (in very vigorous kicks) the hip-flexor effect of gravity. Thus, there was an intricate-and nonintuitive--interplay of muscle, motion- dependent, and gravitational torques as the infants kicked. Thus, for animals and humans, the use of inverse dynamics can be a useful tool to examine motor control. But what are the ele- ments of a rigid-body dynamics analysis? Specifically, at each of the joints of the linked segments, we partition the torques into four categories: net joint torque, gravi- tational torque, motion-dependent torques, and generalized muscle torque (Hoy &amp; Zer- nicke, 1985, 1986; Hoy et al., 1985; Schnei- der &amp; Zernicke, 1990; Schneider et al., 1989, 1990; Smith &amp; Zernicke, 1987; Thelen et al., 1992; Wisleder et al., 1990; Zernicke et al., 1991). The net, gravitational, and motion- dependent torques are calculated directly from limb kinematics and anthropometric data, but the generalized muscle torque is calculated as a residual term; the sum of the generalized muscle torque and the other torques components must equal the net torque. In nonmathematical terms, these relations can be written as: Net Joint Torque = Gravitational Torque + Motion-Dependent Torques + Generalized Muscle Torque, where 1. Net Joint Torque: The product of the segmental moment of inertia and angular ac- celeration (I - a) (the sum of all positive and negative torque components [gravitational, motion-dependent, and muscle] that act at a joint). 2. Gravitational Torque: A passive torque from gravity acting at the center of mass of each segment. 3. Motion-Dependent Torques: Torques due to the motion of the segments in a linked system. These torques arise from mechani- cal interactions among segments; for exam- ple, inertial forces are proportional to seg- mental accelerations or centripetal forces are proportional to the square of segmental ve- locities. In the equations of motion that we use, motion-dependent torques are related to (a) shoulder linear accelerations, (b) up- per arm, forearm, and hand angular accelera- tions, and (c) upper arm, forearm, and hand angular velocities. These torques quantify the limb intersegmental dynamics and are the "reactive phenomena" described by Bernstein when he said that "the secret of co-ordination lies not only in not wasting superfluous force in extinguishing reactive phenomena but, on the contrary, in em- ploying the latter in such a way as to employ active muscle forces only in the capacity of complementary forces" (1967, p. 109)- these are the torque components that the mover should exploit rather than fight. 4. Generalized Muscle Torque: This "generalized" torque includes forces arising</page><page sequence="7">988 Child Development from active muscle contractions and from passive deformations of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and other periarticular tissues. Because the effects of active muscular forces are embedded within this component, the generalized muscle torque comprises the ac- tively controlled elements of motor patterns. During motor learning and development, information about this torque component is particularly important for revealing the changes in the control of intralimb coordi- nation. Anthropometric Data To use inverse dynamics to calculate joint forces and torques, it is necessary to have accurate estimates of segmental masses (m), center-of-mass locations, and segmental moments of inertia (I). For adults, these body-segment parameters are usually ap- proximated by using published values (e.g., Dempster, 1955) or by using mathematical models (e.g., Hatze, 1980). With the Hatze model, for example, the human body is ap- proximated by 17 segments with various geometric shapes. With standard anthropo- metric instrumentation, 242 measurements are taken to calculate the volumes of the 17 body segments, and body-density values de- termined from cadaver studies are used to calculate the mass, center-of-mass location, and moment of inertia of each of the 17 body segments. Although some data have been pub- lished for children over 4 years of age (Jen- sen, 1986), until recently, no body-segment parameter data existed for infants. The ab- sence of such data precluded dynamics anal- yses for infants. Our group, however, took anthropometric data from 18 infants, and we modified a three-dimensional, 17-segment model of the human body (Hatze, 1979, 1980) to make it applicable for infants (Schneider et al., 1990). Using the modified model, with measurements from 44 infants for upper limbs and from 70 infants for lower limbs, the anthropometric inertia parameters (i.e., masses, center-of-mass locations, and transverse moments of inertia) for infant up- per and lower limb segments (upper arm, forearm, and hand; thigh, leg, and foot) were determined and used to formulate regres- sion equations that predict limb anthropo- metric inertia parameters for use in equa- tions of motion to analyze the limb dynamics of human infants (Schneider &amp; Zernicke, 1992). With these equations now available, other researchers can calculate estimates of body segment parameters for use in dynam- ics analyses by knowing only an infant's age, body mass, and the length and circumfer- ence of the segment of interest. Control of Limb Dynamics in Adults Because so few dynamics analyses have been done with human infants (e.g., Schnei- der et al., 1990; Thelen et al., 1992, 1993, in this issue), we first review studies with human adults to illustrate the usefulness of inverse dynamics for providing insight into motor control. In a series of experiments, we tested Bernstein's suggestion that practice alters coordination among muscle, gravita- tional, and motion-dependent joint torques (Schneider et al., 1989) and examined the relation between motor learning and move- ment smoothness (Schneider &amp; Zernicke, 1989). To add to these studies, here, we also include data from a pilot study in which we tested whether a basic joint-torque profile acquired during practice is subsequently scaled when movement speed is varied. We investigated these issues because they had not been examined extensively in "motor learning" studies, and "motor con- trol" studies, generally, have not focused on practice-related changes in movement con- trol. Although many studies in motor learn- ing (Adams, 1987) have investigated the ac- quisition of motor skill-with performance typically measured by an outcome score, such as movement time-these data have added relatively little to our understanding of how movement control changes during practice. The few studies (Hobart, Kelly, &amp; Bradley, 1975; Marteniuk &amp; Romanow, 1983; Vorro, 1973) that report changes in movement patterns during practice typi- cally involve only simple tasks. Such simple tasks, however, are inadequate for answer- ing questions about the control of multiseg- mented limbs moving in three-dimensional gravitational space, including such natural movements as throwing a ball or reaching to pick up a cup from a table. Research in motor control, on the other hand, has been directed primarily toward understanding the mechanisms of move- ment control, as in the formation of arm and hand trajectories in humans (Abend, Bizzi, &amp; Morasso, 1982; Atkeson &amp; Hollerbach, 1985; Lacquaniti &amp; Soechting, 1982) or ro- botic systems (Atkeson, 1989; Hollerbach, 1982), in kinematic (Gentner, 1987; Viviani &amp; Cenzato, 1985) or electromyographic in- variances (Gielen, van den Oosten, &amp; ter Gunne, 1985), and in principles of optimiza-</page><page sequence="8">Zernicke and Schneider 989 tion (Flash &amp; Hogan, 1985; Hogan, 1984; Nelson, 1983). Unfortunately, these studies, also, generally involved simple, restricted movements, and the experiments were mostly analyzed in terms of kinematics, with little information available about the move- ment dynamics (Atkeson, 1989; Hollerbach &amp; Flash, 1982). Skilled movements can be acquired through practice that is directed toward achieving specific objectives, such as move- ment accuracy in typing (Nelson, 1983). In addition to such task-specific goals, how- ever, more global movement objectives have been proposed, for example, efficiency (Bernstein, 1967), economy and effective- ness (Cavanagh &amp; Kram, 1985), or smooth- ness (Nelson, 1983). To understand how movement control may be related to these objectives requires that they be quantified by some physical movement characteristics. Most people will agree-intuitively-- that "jerky" movements are the opposite of "smooth" movements, but interestingly, movement "smoothness" can also be de- fined and quantified mathematically as jerk (Flash, 1983; Flash &amp; Hogan, 1982, 1985; Hogan, 1984; Nelson, 1983). The jerk-time function [j(t)] is the third time derivative of a displacement-time function and the first time derivative of an acceleration-time func- tion [j (t) = da(t)/dt]. Nelson (1983) showed that total jerk-cost [j,] can be calculated as mean-squared jerk (j, = fT[j (t)2dt]/2). Flash and Hogan (1985) suggest that the "minimization of mean-squared jerk is a mathematical model of one movement ob- jective, the production of smooth graceful movements." If one goal of motor coordina- tion is to produce the smoothest movement, jerk-cost should be less for practiced move- ments than for unpracticed movements. This we examined by analyzing modulations in jerk-cost during practice of a motor task and after the task was well practiced (Schneider &amp; Zernicke, 1989). A linear scaling of joint torques with movement speed has been reported for some human arm motions (e.g., Hollerbach &amp; Flash, 1982) and for mechanical manipulator trajectories (e.g., Hollerbach, 1984). Hol- lerbach and co-workers (Atkeson &amp; Hol- lerbach, 1985; Hollerbach, 1982; Hollerbach &amp; Flash, 1982) propose that, for different movement speeds, an invariant velocity pro- file along a fixed path would be a parsimoni- ous control strategy for biological arms and would also avoid the need for complete recomputation of the inverse dynamics solution for mechanical manipulators (Hol- lerbach, 1984). Soechting (1984), however, has indi- cated that, while scaling may be valid for some movement to a given target, the evi- dence for a general scaling law having more general validity remains equivocal. Soech- ting reported a lack of simple scaling as a result of differences in normalized move- ment times, shoulder angular velocity pro- files, and shoulder flexor torque profiles as subjects moved between targets in a vertical plane (Soechting, 1984). Even for move- ments along a fixed path, the evidence for simple scaling of dynamics variables is sparse; Hollerbach and Flash (1982), for example, report a straightforward relation between velocity and torques, but their data were for a limited range of movement speeds. Although it is an attractive concept that humans may use a practice strategy that uses slow movements to learn basic torque profiles and simply scale these profiles to in- crease speed (Hollerbach, 1982), a repat- terning of torque profiles in a complex task would be inconsistent with a simple, linear scaling of torques. Experimental Methods Only a brief overview of procedures and methods is provided here, because the full details are available in Schneider et al. (1989) and Schneider and Zernicke (1989, 1990). In these experiments, subjects were asked to perform maximal-speed arm move- ments. Each subject was seated in front of a clear Plexiglas sheet on which arrows marked the location of upper and lower tar- get light beams (Fig. 2). Subjects sat on a straight-backed chair while the pelvis and torso were secured to the chair by lap and shoulder seat belts to minimize trunk mo- tion. Subjects were asked to start at the lower light beam, to go as fast as possible, circumnavigate a barrier that was placed midway between the two targets, break the upper light beam, again round the barrier, and stop in the lower light beam. Subjects were not given any instructions about accu- racy, other than informing them that they had to interrupt the upper light beam and stop in the lower light beam. After each trial, subjects were given verbal feedback of their total movement time (in milliseconds) and information about their success or lack of success in breaking the light-beam targets. In our primary study, seven adult male</page><page sequence="9">990 Child Development 2/ FIG. 2.--Frontal and lateral views of experimental set-up and subject position.

Subjects started and ended the movement with the circular plate held steady in the lower light beam. The upper light beam only had to be interrupted by the metal plate as subjects reversed their upward motion to begin the downward phase of the task. volunteers each performed 100 practice tri- als. In the pilot study to assess scaling of torques, an additional four adult male volun- teers each performed 120 practice trials, re- turned 1 day later, and performed another 20 trials to assess skill retention. After com- pletion of the practice trials, subjects re- peated the movement task across a range of movement times-from very slow to fast. The arm movements were recorded with high-speed cin6 film or an optoelectronic system, with markers placed on each sub- ject's glenohumeral, elbow, wrist, and third metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints. The third MP was an indicator of a subject's hand mo- tion. For three of the seven subjects in the primary study, electromyograms for upper- extremity muscles (biceps brachii, triceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and posterior del- toid) were recorded. A three-dimensional analysis of movement kinematics and a pla- nar analysis of limb dynamics were com- pleted for both the primary and pilot studies. Data Analysis Three-dimensional joint coordinates were recorded, linear and angular displace- ment-time data were smoothed, and first, second, and third derivatives were calcu- lated. We modeled the upper limb as three interconnected rigid links (hand, forearm, upper arm) with frictionless joints at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist (Fig. 1) and used the joint three-dimensional coordinates to determine the inclination angles and time derivatives (angular accelerations and veloc- ities) for the hand, forearm, and upper arm. With estimates of segmental masses, center- of-mass locations, and moments of inertia the two-dimensional dynamics were calcu- lated for the limb in a moving-local plane containing the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints (Fig. 1). At each joint, torques were calculated about axes that were normal to the moving-local plane and that passed through the joints (mathematical details in Schneider et al., 1989; and Schneider &amp; Zer- nicke, 1990; also see Fig. 1). Changes in Limb Dynamics with Practice During the practice trials of our primary study, movement times decreased signifi- cantly. From the slowest to the fastest trial, an average decrease of 36% in movement time was achieved, with the slowest trial equaling about 1 sec and the fastest trial 0.6 sec. The major decrease in movement time was accomplished in the first 25 practice tri- als, as we observed an exponential decrease in movement time with practice. As subjects became faster during prac- tice, hand paths became more parabolic in</page><page sequence="10">Zernicke and Schneider 991 shape with the apex near the barrier (Fig. 3). The,curved hand path (Fig. 3, left) changed from a motion in which the hand basically was pulled out of the lower target, moved nearly straight up to clear the barrier and moved into the upper target to a path (Fig. 3, right) that appeared more rounded and smooth. When the hand acceleration vectors (straight lines originating from the curved line, see Fig. 3) were superimposed on the hand path and the before-and-after practice patterns compared, it was apparent that at the beginning of practice the accelera- tion vectors fluctuated-indicating frequent changes in acceleration magnitude and di- rection. With practice, the acceleration vectors increased in magnitude (e.g., at the bar- rier the magnitude increased approximately 70%), and the vectors became more consis- tent in direction. The movement appeared qualitatively "smoother," and this appear- ance was supported when jerk-cost was cal- culated; total jerk-cost was significantly less (63%) for identical-duration movements in the after-practice versus before-practice tri- als. In addition, the jerk-cost components representing the magnitudinal and direc- tional changes in hand acceleration vector were of the same order of magnitude, and both components were similarly decreased when comparing after-practice to before- practice trials. Thus, after practice, move- ments were smoother because subjects reduced the rate of change of hand-accel- eration magnitude and direction (Schnei- der &amp; Zernicke, 1989). How were the movement dynamics modulated to produce the changes seen in movement kinematics? To answer that ques- tion, we will focus on the reversal at the up- per target, because the most prominent changes in kinematics occurred in that re- gion of the movement (a representative ex- ample of the intersegmental dynamics for the reversal region at the shoulder joint is provided in Fig. 4). As the hand approached the upper tar- get, the shoulder joint was flexing, and shoulder extension started as the hand left the upper target. In Figure 4, shoulder torques are compared for before (Fig. 4A) versus after practice (Fig. 4B; trial 1 vs. 100). At the shoulder joint, positive torques acted to extend the shoulder, and negative torques acted to flex the shoulder. In the initial prac- tice trials, during the reversal, the dominant motion-dependent torque component was related to upper-arm-angular acceleration (UAA)-which acted to flex the shoulder joint. This small flexor torque was counter- acted by an extensor torque caused by grav- ity (GRA) together with a relatively small muscle torque (MUS). This, essentially, was an equilibrium at the shoulder where a small muscle extensor torque was produced to as- sist gravity in counteracting the motion- dependent torque component due to upper- arm-angular acceleration. At the end of practice (Fig. 4B), how- ever, a considerable increase in the upper- arm-angular acceleration torque had devel- oped-still acting to flex the shoulder (note the 2.5-fold scale difference in the before- vs. after-practice graphs). Because the limb position at the reversal was the same at the start and end of practice, the magnitude of the gravitational torque remained un- changed, and thus, its relative importance was greatly diminished by the end of prac- tice. Thus, after practice, gravity was com- paratively less of a factor in reversing the FIG. 3.-Exemplar hand paths for the upward phase, with acceleration vectors for a before-practice (left) and an after-practice movement (right). The hand path is the continuous curved line, with succes- sive linear acceleration vectors (denoting magnitude and direction) shown as straight lines originating from the hand path. To scale the dimensions of the acceleration vectors (m - S-2) to the dimensions of the hand path (m), the magnitudes of the acceleration vectors were multiplied by 0.005.</page><page sequence="11">992 Child Development 20 EXTENSOR A 15 GRA 10 NET .MUS a 0 1- .10 -15 UAA FLEXOR -20 0.27 0.37 0.47 0.57 0.67 0.77 TIME (s) 50 EXTENSOR 8 40 NET MUS 30U E 20 cc GRA o -20 -30 UAA -40 FLEXOR -50 0.18 0.28 0.38 0.48 TIME (s) FIG. 4.-Shoulder-joint torques for a before-practice (A) and an after-practice (B) movement dur- ing the reversal in the upper target. Positive torques tend to cause shoulder extension, and negative torques tend to cause shoulder flexion (lift the arm). Note the more than twofold difference in torque magnitudes in A (-17 to 10 N - m) versus B (-40 to 50 N - m). The specific torques illustrated are: NET-net joint torque, MUS-generalized muscle torque, GRA--gravitational torque, UAA-inertial torque related to upper arm angular acceleration. motion, and a large extensor torque had to be generated by the shoulder muscles to counteract the large motion-dependent UAA flexor torque-to produce the requisite net extensor torque for reversing the motion. To compensate for an increased flexor torque at the shoulder (associated with an increased acceleration of the linked system) the mus- cle torque had to increase significantly. The peak muscle torque increased by approxi- mately 650%, which was coupled with an increased (300%) peak upper-arm-angular acceleration torque. The analysis of biceps brachii and tri- ceps brachii EMG patterns revealed a near- tonic activity during early practice, while the phasic patterns of the anterior and poste- rior deltoids produced distinct records. In early practice, the anterior deltoid displayed a shortening contraction to flex the shoulder to move the hand toward the upper target, and the posterior deltoid actively slowed shoulder flexion just prior to the hand enter- ing the upper target. In the reversal region, at the upper target, in slower trials, cocon- traction occurred in the anterior and poste- rior deltoid. In the faster trials, however, the posterior deltoid was recruited significantly earlier in the motion as the handapproached the upper target. Thus, the phasic recruit- ment of the posterior deltoid served to slow the rate of shoulder flexion and to put the posterior deltoid on stretch to enhance the speed of shoulder extension when the hand left the upper target. The dynamics analysis suggested that, with practice, muscle torques were used to more effectively counteract and complement motion-dependent torques and that practice alters the coordination among muscular and motion-dependent torques. The EMG re- sults further suggested that the recruitment of muscles during presumed lengthening contractions exploits the passive-mechanical (viscoelastic) properties of the muscle and tendon (Schneider et al., 1989).</page><page sequence="12">Zernicke and Schneider 993 Scaling of Torques with Movement Speed Representative muscle torque patterns at the shoulder joint-scaled to 100% total movement time-for practice trial 1 (P1), practice trial 120 (P120), second-day repeti- tion trial 1 (Ri), and repetition trial 20 (R20) in our pilot study are shown in Figure 5. The torque patterns changed markedly during practice, and the acquired patterns were retained when subjects came back after 1 day-there was a slightly diminished mag- nitude of peak torque but no change in the basic shape of the torque pattern. At the end of the second day's session (20 trials) the ac- quired torque pattern was comparable to that of the previous day. After completing 20 trials on the second day, subjects were asked to repeat the task at five designated movement times (0.6 sec, 0.8 sec, 1.0 sec, 2.0 sec, and 3.0 sec). The order of these trials was randomized. Each subject was given feedback (time in milli- seconds) after each trial in which he prac- ticed the designated times. Subjects were able to achieve the designated movement times (+ 10 ms) within three to six practice trials. Typical shoulder-joint muscle-torque patterns for the five different speeds are il- lustrated in Figure 6. The torque profiles were markedly dif- ferent between comparatively slow and fast trials. In a representative slowest trial (3.0 sec) the muscle torque was negligible and flexor throughout the motion--essentially the torque produced to counteract gravity. In the 2.0 sec trial, the pattern changed slightly, displaying increased oscillations but still flexor throughout. With further in- creases in movement speed, the basic, learned pattern reemerged; the muscle torque changed from extensor (0%-15%), to flexor (15%-40%), to extensor (40%-60%), to flexor (60%-80%), to extensor (80%- 100%) torque. This pattern was somewhat recognizable in the 2.0 sec trial-the torque minima at 20% and 85% in the 2.0 sec trial apparently increased to become distinctly flexor when movement speed increased (1.0-0.6 sec), and the torque maxima at 35% and 70% in the 2.0 sec trial combined into the extensor torque observed at 50% in faster trials. Although the torque profiles looked similar at higher movement speeds (1.0-0.6 sec)-indicating that a basic profile was ac- quired during learning, the torques did not scale linearly with movement time. The peak torques at the reversal point increased at a disproportionately greater rate com- pared to the decreased movement times. Thus, a stable torque pattern was ac- quired during practice, and the profile at the end of the practice trials was markedly dif- ferent than the profiles seen at the beginning of practice. During practice in these pilot subjects, no simple, linear scaling of torque patterns was observed, and even after prac- tice-when the motion was performed at a range of speeds-torque profiles did not scale linearly with movement speed. In slow movements, the motion-dependent torques counterbalanced the effect of gravity, but with increased movement speed, the torque patterns changed so that muscle torques pri- 100- EXTENSOR 80'R20 * 60 *60 P120 : 40- R1 20 O O S-20 P1 -40 FLEXOR 96 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 TIME (%) FIG. 5.-Shoulder-joint muscle torque patterns for practice trial 1 (P1), practice trial 120 (P120), second-day repetition trial 1 (RI), and repetition trial 20 (R20).

Motor Control Implications These experiments reinforce the con- cept that intersegmental dynamics can play an important role for the control for limb tra- jectories, as noted by Hollerbach and Flash (1982) and Soechting and Flanders (1991) for humans and for mechanical manipulators (e.g., Hollerbach, 1984). It is becoming more apparent that the analysis of intersegmental dynamics is important for understanding the forces that produce multisegmental limb motions. These experiments also indicate that significant changes in dynamics can oc- cur during the practice of a motor task. Consistent with Bernstein's concepts of coordination, our results show that muscle forces can counteract and complement mo- tion-dependent torques and that practice can alter the coordination among muscular, grav- itational, and motion-dependent torques. For example, the torque patterns at the shoulder joint during the movement reversal indicated--already at the beginning of prac- tice-that passive torques played some role in the control of the movement. Neverthe- less, with this complex, multijointed move- ment, practice was needed to coordinate the active and passive forces of the moving arm so that subjects could use muscle torques ef- fectively as complementary forces-as pre- dicted by Bernstein (1967). This is an important feature of skilled- movement acquisition, in that the person not only avoids "wasting superfluous force" (Bernstein, 1967) but exploits the passive forces to enhance coordination. Each sub- ject's motor problem involved "supple- menting" the passive properties of the mov- ing limb-in effect minimizing the disparity between the initial dynamics profile and the limb dynamics that produced the time- minimized movement. Bernstein indicated that practice is the process of solving a motor problem using techniques perfected from repetition to repetition, resulting in a reorga- nization of the motor program. In this sense, the central control structure was modified over the course of practice. After practice, the control strategy that emerged during practice was maintained when the subjects repeated the task. When compared to the torque pattern at the begin- ning of practice, however, the profile at the end of practice did not scale in a simple lin- ear manner to achieve increased movement speeds. Also, the after-practice torque pro- files did not scale in a simple, linear manner when movement speeds varied from slow to fast. The relative complexity of our task- with the multiple targets and barrier-may have contributed to the lack of simple linear scaling. Our pilot study, in which movement times were systematically varied, lends sup- port for a theoretical prediction made by At- keson and Hollerbach (1985). Their experi- ments were conducted on upper extremity movements in a horizontal plane-with gravity's effects neutralized-and, in those conditions, torques scaled with the inverse square of movement time. For nonhorizon- tal-plane upper-extremity movements, they</page><page sequence="14">Zernicke and Schneider 995 predicted that the relation would be more complex. Undoubtedly, additional experi- ments are needed to probe the details of scaling strategies that may be employed as a person performs well-practiced movements along a broad range of speeds, across a vari- ety of movement planes, and with different accuracies and objectives. Changes in Limb Dynamics as Infants Learn to Reach To bring these methods of dynamics to bear on questions related to developmental motor control, during the past several years we have collaborated with Esther Thelen and her colleagues at Indiana University on their ambitious longitudinal project that, in part, is charting how infants acquire dexter- ity in reaching and grasping during the first year of life (Thelen et al., 1992, 1993, in this issue). It is apparent that, during the first year of life, human infants undergo dramatic changes in motor control. They must acquire motor skills as their body segments change rapidly in mass and geometry. While body segments change size, the infant must coor- dinate a daunting array of muscular and in- teractive forces as she or he learns to reach for an object. By applying the methods of inverse dy- namics to studies of how infants learn to reach, intriguing questions in develop- mental motor control can be probed. For example, how do the dynamics of upper- extremity movements change during the first year of life? How are the undirected, erratic limb movements of the very young infant later molded into well-coordinated, precise reaching movements? As infants harness the active and passive dynamics of their upper extremity during reaching, do they learn to exploit the motion-dependent torques of their limbs-similar to adults learning a new motor task? These are only a few of the numerous questions that can be investigated as meth- ods of inverse dynamics are used to examine the mechanisms underlying changes in mo- tor control during development. We are ad- dressing these and other questions, as our collaborative group analyzes data (Thelen, 1992a, 1992b; Thelen et al., 1992; Zernicke &amp; Schneider, 1992) for Nathan-one of four infants studied weekly from 3 weeks of age to 30 weeks and every 2 weeks thereafter until 52 weeks of age-as he gained dexter- ity in a standard task of reaching to a toy (for added background, see Thelen et al., 1993, in this issue). Method For all reaching trials, Nathan was seated in an armless, inclined (300 from the vertical) infant seat, with his torso secured to the backrest with a snug, but comfortable broad band. Using three-dimensional data acquisition and analysis methods similar to those reported in the preceding section on adults, we derived kinematic and dynamic data for the upper arm, forearm, and hand segments of Nathan's upper extremity. The preliminary data discussed here are based on two to five trials of Nathan's reaches or attempted reaches for a toy at each of the following ages: 5, 12, 17, 22, 26, 30, 36, 38, 42, 48, 50, and 51 weeks. Results Because the focus in this paper is on dynamics, the following results emphasize changes in torque and muscle power profiles as Nathan learned to reach. Summary infor- mation on changes in Nathan's hand path and intralimb coordination is also provided to give a kinematic context for the changes in limb dynamics. Greater detail about Na- than's limb kinematics on the transition to reaching is found in a companion paper (Thelen et al., 1993, in this issue). Hand path.-At 12 weeks, Nathan per- formed arm-extended reaches that hit the toy as part of spontaneous, undirected "flap- ping" movements (Thelen, 1992b; Thelen et al., 1992, 1993, in this issue). Through 22 weeks, most of his reaches or attempted reaches had hand trajectories with frequent reversals of direction and with paths, appar- ently, not directed at the toy. In weeks 26-42, there were more sequentially orga- nized hand paths and a plateau in the num- ber of hand-path reversals (Thelen, 1992b; Thelen et al., 1993, in this issue); the se- quential nature of his hand path was to first move his hand away from his side and then move, rather directly, upward and to the midline to reach the toy. During the last sev- eral weeks of the first year, Nathan's hand movements tended to be more smooth and directed upward, forward, and toward the midline to the toy (Thelen et al., 1993, in this issue). These results are consistent with the re- cent report of Hofsten (1991), who analyzed reaches of five infants, recorded at 19 weeks of age and then every third week until 31 weeks. At all of these ages, Hofsten found that the infants had sequentially structured</page><page sequence="15">996 Child Development hand movements; there were phases of acceleration and deceleration with reach- ing trajectories relatively straight within these units. Within increasing age, the in- fants became more systematic in the sequen- tial structure of their hand movements, and the "transport unit" (the unit of reach that moved the hand the greatest distance) at the beginning of the reach tended to be- come longer and more dominant. As the in- fants got older, their hand paths became straighter. Intralimb coordination. -Nathan was a motorically active infant, and early on he displayed frequent, nondirected flapping limb movements. Thus, coordination be- tween the elbow and shoulder joint actions was also erratic and quite variable in the early weeks. Nevertheless, later, as Nathan gradually began to move more directly to the toy, a more consistent pattern emerged- first elbow flexion, followed by shoulder flexion, with the maximum velocities of el- bow extension and shoulder flexion oc- curring relatively close in time as the hand moved toward the toy. Muscular torques.-In early reaching movements (5-22 weeks), Nathan princi- pally used flexor muscle torques at both the shoulder and elbow to counteract the gravi- tational extensor torque (Fig. 7). Later (26- 38 weeks) the sequential motions of the hand were linked to the sequential modula- tion of flexor muscle torques at the elbow and shoulder; an increase in shoulder flexor muscle torque was followed by an increase in elbow flexor muscle torque. The muscular torques at the shoulder and elbow became more tightly coupled during weeks 48-51, with the shoulder muscle torques of greater magnitude than the elbow (Fig. 8). The contrast in the coordination of el- bow and shoulder muscle torques in early versus late reaches is illustrated in Figure 7 (12 weeks) and Figure 8 (51 weeks). In each of these figures, a negative torque is flexor (tending to lift the arm), and a positive torque is extensor at both the elbow and shoulder. Part A of Figures 7 and 8 shows the time-series plots of the elbow and shoul- der muscle torques, while part B of each figure illustrates the coordination of the muscle torques at the two joints as torque versus torque graphs (in Figs. 7B and 8B the filled circle indicates the beginning of the reach). At 12 weeks (Fig. 7), throughout the reach, the elbow and shoulder muscle torques are flexor to counteract gravity's ex- tensor effect. But later (Fig. 8), Nathan has learned to coordinate these torques better. In this reach at 51 weeks, Nathan has small flexor torques in both the elbow and shoul- der, but then he develops an extensor mus- cle torque at the shoulder (around 2.0 sec, Fig. 8A). The shoulder extensor muscle torque is followed closely by a flexor torque (3-4 sec). Although the motion-dependent torques are not shown in Figure 8, Nathan is using shoulder muscle torques to counter- balance motion-dependent torques being generated during the reach. By using muscle torques to counterbalance motion-depen- dent torques, Nathan is showing elements of coordination that were also found in the adults as they became more skilled (Schnei- der et al., 1989). But Nathan had to learn to harness the excessive motion-dependent torques that were the hallmark of his early reaches (Fig. 9A). For example, in Figure 9A, for a reach at 17 weeks, shoulder joint torques are shown. The NET is the net joint torque, GRA is the gravitational torque, MUS is the shoulder muscle torque, and MDT is the sum of the individual motion-dependent torque compo- nents. Figure 9B depicts those shoulder torques for a representative reach at 51 weeks. It is evident that Nathan learned to "damp" the excessive MDT of the early reaches to produce a smoother reaching pat- tern at the older age. For example, in Figure 9A (around 5.5 sec) Nathan had to use a sub- stantial shoulder muscle moment to offset the large, erratic MDT. In contrast, Figure 9B (51 weeks) shows how the motion-depen- dent torques are much reduced in magni- tude and are modulated during the interplay between MUS and GRA as he moves to the toy (2-3 sec). Coordination of muscular and motion- dependent torques.-The motion-depen- dent torques, associated with inertial and centripetal forces, were excessive and poorly controlled in Nathan's early reaches. As Nathan acquired greater skill in reaching, he was able to damp the extraneous, unpro- ductive motion-dependent torques, while learning to effectively use appropriately timed motion-dependent torques to comple- ment muscle torques. Inertial torques re- lated to upper-arm and forearm angular ac- celerations and the linear acceleration of the shoulder joint were the most important in- tersegmental torques throughout the first year of the developnient of reaching. During weeks 50-51, in particular, Nathan's inertial motion-dependent torques (upper-arm and</page><page sequence="16">Zernicke and Schneider 997 Muscle Torque(N.m)/N NQ1216 0.000 -- FLEX Elbow Shoulder A -0.006 8.0 Time (s) 12.0 Muscle Torque(N.m)/N Shoulder NQ1216 .0.0004 FLEX B .0.0054 - -0.0022 0 0.0003 FLEX Elbow EXT FIG. 7.--Shoulder- and elbow-joint muscle torques of a representative reach for Nathan at 12 weeks.

As the hand approached the toy, the shoulder and elbow flexor muscle torques were modulated in response to the varying flexor or extensor effects of these interactive torques. Muscle power.-As explained earlier, joint muscle power is the muscle torque at a joint multiplied by the joint's angular veloc- ity. By noting the sign of the joint muscle power, it is possible to determine whether mechanical power is being generated (posi- tive) or absorbed (negative) by the muscles crossing the limb joints (Winter, 1990). Fig- ure 10A provides a schematic interpretation of a shoulder versus elbow joint muscle power diagram. These diagrams provide a great deal of information about the coordina- tion of power between these joints, but they appear to be difficult to interpret-at first</page><page sequence="17">998 Child Development Muscle Torque(N.m)/N NQ5104 0.0005 EXT Elbow Shoulder FLEX A -0.00261 1 1- ,7 1 1.0 Time (s) 4.0 Muscle Torque(N.m)/N Shoulder NQ5104 0.0005 EXT 0 - FLEX B -0.0026 - -0.0012 0 0.002 FLEX EXT FIG. 8.-Shoulder- and elbow-joint muscle torques of a representative reach for Nathan at 51 weeks (Trial NQ5104). Part A illustrates the torques as a time series, and B shows the same data as a torque versus torque plot (solid circle indicates start of reach).

Absolute time (sec) within a 14-sec "trial" is given in 8A. glance. The power diagrams are straightfor- ward to interpret, however, if you remember that when both the elbow and shoulder are generating power, the curve (data) will be located in the upper-right quadrant, and when both joints are absorbing power, the curve will be in the lower left quadrant. The upper-left quadrant indicates elbow power absorption and shoulder power generation, and the lower right quadrant indicates el- bow power generation and shoulder power absorption. Representative examples of Nathan's muscle power profiles at the elbow and shoulder joints are shown in Figures 10B (12 weeks), 10C (30 weeks), and 10D (50 weeks). In the early weeks (5-22), Nathan's shoulder and elbow muscle power profiles were quite erratic (Fig. 10B), as would be expected</page><page sequence="18">Zernicke and Schneider 999 Shoulder Joint Torques (N.m)/N NQ1714 0.002 EXT GRA T M NETDT NET 0.0 FLEX A us -0.002 5.0 Time (s) 7.0 Shoulder Joint Torques (N.m)/N NQ5106 0.0015 - EXT 00 NET 0.0 , \.DT FLEX - B -0.0015 I 0.0 Time (s) 3.0 FIG. 9.-Shoulder joint torques for representative reaches at 17 weeks (A) and 51 weeks (B).

Later, with the sequential hand movements, a pattern emerged with first power generation at both elbow and shoul- der joints followed by a combined shoulder joint power generation and elbow joint power absorption (Fig. 10C). In the last 2 weeks, the coordinated reaches frequently had a triphasic relation between elbow and shoulder joint muscle power: (1) power gen- eration at both elbow and shoulder, then (2) elbow absorption and shoulder generation, followed by (3) power absorption at both the elbow and shoulder joints as Nathan arrived to grasp the toy (Fig. 10D).

As the seg- mental, motion-dependent torques became more in phase, Nathan learned to use mus- cular torques to modulate the effects of the motion-dependent torques as he approached the toy (Zernicke &amp; Schneider, 1992). The joint muscle power profiles of the reaches during the final weeks of the first year showed that Nathan was learning to coordi- nate effectively concentric and eccentric contractions to control his limb movements. Concluding Comments An enormous amount of electromyo- graphic, kinematic, and dynamics data have been collected for the four infants in the lon- gitudinal study on the development of coor- dinated reaching (Thelen et al., 1993, in this issue). Our group continues to analyze these data, and the preliminary dynamics results, as noted for Nathan, show promise of reveal- ing new insights into how infants learn to control their limb movements. As we have stated previously, investigations into devel- opmental motor control can complement studies of the control and coordination of well-practiced movements, because "devel- opmental studies are natural experiments in the processes of change" (Thelen et al., 1992). In this brief overview of biomechanics and dynamics-with its applications to both adult and infant behavior-we surveyed some of the analytical tools of biomechanics that are readily available to study infant mo- tor behavior. It is important that researchers in infant neuromotor development move be- yond simple correlations of anatomy and be- havior and begin to employ the methods of dynamics analysis to probe the underlying physical causes of changes in infant move- ments.
