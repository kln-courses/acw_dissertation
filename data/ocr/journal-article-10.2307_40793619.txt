FROM ART TO MATHEMATICS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE NET A NOTE ON THE CATALOGUING OF VISUAL INFORMATION IN MUSEUMS Susanne Kuchler (UCL) A decade has gone by since Vogel's Duchampian act of placing a Zande hunting net into an exhibition on African art. The net provoked a number of publications legitimising or condemning the transferrai of what appeared to be a mere artefact into the category of art. Readers interested in the unfolding debate on the distinction between art and artefacts may be referred to Gell's (1996) succinct summary made in an article in which he also laid the ground for exploring the 'abductive', trap-like quality of the hunting net which I wish to continue in this paper. What lessons, we may ask, have we learned from the display of the net? Even the most uninformed of visitors to the exhibition would have understood the net as an attack on nineteenth century art/craft distinc- tion, which its presence in the exhibition certainly intended to provoke. Then there is the insight of the affinity between the net and the modernist project, beautifully revealed by Gell (1996), though possibly more appar- ent to those who care to dwell on it rather longer. Like Duchamp's Ready- Mades, the net is only apparently arbitrary, in fact, however, both are 'being carefully selected and working because they have complex historic and iconographie resonances' (Gell 1996: 36). For Gell, the conceptual complexity of the net lay in its association with systems of objectification: the net 'traps' its victim by working as the material embodiment of its being, its behaviour and physical characteristics. Convincing, fun and provocative, Gell's treatment of the net neverthe- less leaves open one question: does it matter that it was a net which was displayed, or could it equally have been a South-American fish-trap, or for that matter, the tragic Rhino trap which feature as comparable examples in Gell's 'Vogel's Net'? If one accepts Gell's argument that any artefact can attain person-like attributes and relational capacity, surely any thing, if not any trap-like artefact, would have sparked off a possibly very similar debate. On the other hand, there is something specific about the net, its selection and reception, which indeed appears not to be arbitrary and this is that it is made of knots. Knotted things, I want to argue, are indeed objects that are scrutinised as vehicles of complicated ideas which are difficult, allusive, and hard to bring off, yet they trap our thinking not because they are a trap, but 1</page><page sequence="2">Susanne Kuchler because of the particular resonance provoked by knotting. This resonance is experienced in a particularly pronounced manner, I would argue, in the intellectual field of the late 1980s museum culture. The receptivity for the resonance of the net arose with the demise of the validity of the theory of the unconscious; a search for an alternative frame of reference in things had begun which hoped to find a fresh perspective on the mind (Rosen- field 1993). The knot's complex juxtaposition of metaphoric and mathe- matical properties had turned it into the favourite object of meditation among humanists and scientists alike. Just listen to Serres who summaris- es the concern of one of his earlier works as follows: The last chapter of the Natural Contract consists of a global account ... a study of the concrete root of the word contract - the connection, the cord, attached or detached. Contract means that some collectivity is working together to pull, or draw some- thing - a plow, a burden. In order to do so, there must be ties that link the pullers, or 'tractors/ to one another and to the thing pulled. This is the source of my continuous meditation on cords - the visible ones that link the ship to the quay as well as those that make the boat a giant latticework of knots, those that bind mountain climbers together or woodcutters to the fallen tree they haul in unison. Then there are those invisible ties that join together lovers and families, the living to life or to death, and mankind to the Earth ... (1995: 88). In this paper I will chart the emergence of this cross-disciplinary con- cern with topologies of social relations and of thought processes and con- sider the shadow it may cast on artefacts that emulate, however modestly, the complexity of contemporary geometry or the messy trajectories of a person's biography. Together the many different approaches to the knot reveal it as a 'tractor' of thought and thus as person-like in a manner that enables one to see how thought can conduct itself in things (Gell 1998). To propose a further foray into the net may appear a highly suspect endeavour: apolitical, not to say heretic in the current climate in which it is deemed appropriate to concentrate on the critique of the art trade and the emerging of visual culture beyond the end of art (cf. Marcus &amp; Meyers 1995). Yet even in the scramble to deconstruct the legacy of the nineteenth century definition of art and craft, nets and cords continue to be just some of the many seemingly uninteresting, mundane things which we have sys- tematically forgotten and with them lost sight of a way of realising the purchase of ethnographic collections beyond the Colonial paradigm and its aestheticising aspirations. It is in offering a mnemic encounter with the forgotten that the Zande 2</page><page sequence="3">From art to mathematics: lessons learned from the net net continues to impart itself on 90s exhibitions and demands to be revisit- ed. Among the many refracted images that such revisiting may produce, there is one which appears to me of crucial importance as it sheds a new light on the debate surrounding the future of the anthropology and ethnog- raphy of art: I would like to call it the nefs 'fluid mechanics', by which I mean the capacity of the knotted thing to draw attention to a non-linear, organic sense of spatial cognition we have long lost sight of and only just begin to rediscover with the emergence of New Genetics and computer technology. Like the new graphic design technology, the knot allows us to experience the 'fluid mechanics' of interior space in that the repeated perfor- mance of both presupposes its prior 'decomposition' and its perception in terms of the relational qualities of its components. In so far that they resem- ble the multiple viewpoints we may cast on geometric objects using graphic design technology, knots can be likened to 'scapes' of virtual reality. The knot's 'virtual' space is not just heavily gendered; it also in its con- creteness recalls Ginzburg's (1983) critique of the evidential paradigm symptomatic of post-eighteenth century culture which accesses knowl- edge through the visual and the word, rather than the materiality of things (cf. Stafford 1991). Vogel's net may indeed be seen to signify a profound change in our understanding of the relation between objects, knowledge and thought processes in ways which embrace the new, post-industrial world of intellectual property with its emphasis on resources and assets of knowledge (Harrison 1995). Should the knot be the key to modelling how such resources are given a presence in the personal and affective domain of experience, guaranteeing alone their mnemic capacity, what we should do with things like the net in ethnographic museums may then become an ever more pressing question. Rediscovering the knot Were it not for the work of the late Alfred Gell (1998), one could think that the rift between the natural sciences and the humanities is as complete now as it was when it emerged within eighteenth century culture (Stafford 1991). For decades, the insights of mathematics, biology or physics have not excited anthropologists, with notable exemptions of D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's (1961) work on the constancy of geometric properties under deformation or Bateson's (1980) use of the notion of 'abduction' used in the theory of logic: both invoked in Alfred Gell's work on art (cf. Gell 1998). Vogel's net appears to both summarise and foreshadow multi-disciplinary insights into the relation between thought and the knotted thing. Around the time of the display of the net in the late 1980s, the knot had been fully recognised as unique in that it 'both embodies mathematical 3</page><page sequence="4">Susanne Kuchler principles and has a tendency to evoke a range of emotional, personal sorts of thoughts' (Strohecker n.d.: 31). It was the evocative capacity of the knot which in science proved vital for an understanding of the nature of con- crete thinking and its importance in the learning of mathematics. Mathe- matics found itself thinking of the knot as the kind of object that is likely to touch people's lives in connecting with personal and 'affective' aspects of thought and thus as forming the springboard for associations that are both abstract and concrete in their mnemic capacity. Like Proust's famous madeleine cake, the knot had began to exemplify the ability to remember by chance something previously experienced and connect it into strings of associations without which thought itself would not be possible.1 For long, the understanding of how objects carry abstract ideas into the head has been obscured by what has been labelled the 'projectionist fallacy' which proposed that objects are the product of the externalising of concepts that are pre-existent to these objects (cf. Davis 1987). The assump- tion that concepts are projected into visual representations found support in the theory of memoria, the conscious recollection of forgotten experi- ences, which was rediscovered for the humanities by Frances Yates' (1966) work, The Art of Memory. The theoretical contexts in which this happened can be easily described: with notions which developed out of post-struc- turalist readings of Freud and Benjamin, Bergson and Proust, which claim an underworld of consciousness and subject-centred philosophy: a supra- human memory whose mechanism is used but not controlled by subject- centred remembering, internalised perhaps, but in a forgetting, self-forget- ting special meaning. As collective, unconscious memory, memoria was of merely practical interest: it was recommended for the reckoning with the past, as pro- gramme for museums, as legitimisation for archives. Reserved as 'black box' for brain physiology and belittled as 'hobby horse' for historians, memoria became of broader interest only with the rise of artificial intelli- gence and the use of computers for the storage of data: when the accessi- bility of the memory store and thus the individual connection to collective memory came into question. Long before the full impact of technology led to a re-examination of the theory of the unconscious and its implication for an understanding of memory (cf. Rosenfield 1993), the mathematician Papert (1980: vi) offered a new approach to the cognitive validity of repre- sentations, reminding us that we do not start with concepts, but think with objects, both in childhood and in everyday experience: by using them as image in thought, and maintaining in thinking the properties that these objects would demonstrate in the physical world. Papert describes how properties of a particular object played a role in his development as a mathematician:2 4</page><page sequence="5">From art to mathematics: lessons learned from the net Before I was two years old I had developed an intense involve- ment with automobiles. The names of car parts made up a very substantial part of my vocabulary: I was particularly proud of knowing about the parts of the transmission system, the gearbox, and most especially the differential. It was, of course, many years later before I understood how gears work; but once I did, playing with gears became a favourite pastime. I loved rotating circular objects against one another in gear-like motions and, naturally, my first 'erector set' project was a crude gear system ... I believe that working with differentials did more for my mathematical development than anything I was taught in ele- mentary school. Gears, serving as models, carried many other- wise abstract ideas into my head (Papert 1980: vi). Work at MIT carried out during the 1980s by Carol Strohecker put Papert's theory of 'syntonic learning', describing the correspondence between the child's experience and the behaviour of things, to test in what she called 'the Knot Lab.' The Knot Lab, situated in an American inner city elementary school, was created as a place where children were encour- aged to have dialogues and debates about different ways to think about knots (and eventually other issues in life, too). Strohecker's research showed how children engaged in 'dialogues' with themselves as they developed a form of critical thinking in which they would launch an inter- pretation of a knot and then retract or modify it as they continued their exploration. The emergence of the climate in which the learning and thinking about topological relationships became an accepted method to investigate ways of knowing was clearly inseparable from the world of artificial intelligence and the replacement of the behaviourist tradition in American psychology by a multidisciplinary approach to computational models which defined thought as problem solving. The discovery of microworlds of topological structures, which form the basis of what psychologists call 'spatial think- ing', in turn opened up the possibility for a new approach to mathematical understanding (Piaget &amp; Inhelder 1967). 'Knot-theory', hitherto in the backwaters of mathematics, was now recognised as a new method for studying the properties of geometric objects that are preserved under deformations. By re-discovering knots as objects for the analysis of complex organic systems, mathematics began to conceive of a fresh approach to topology which took into consideration the late nineteenth century discovery of non-linear dynamic systems that had placed irrevocable doubt in the Newtonian paradigm and with it in a mechanical perception of the world. Today, the complexity and processual dynamic inherent in knot-theory 5</page><page sequence="6">Susanne Kuchler has become vital to the rethinking of modern science which was founded on Newtonian mechanics and thus on the assumption that the universe runs according to a small number of simple laws which humans can dis- cover and understand. It was Einstein's relativity theory which finally broke up Newton's universe of absolute space and time into a multitude of space-time frames each tied to a particular observer and quantum theo- ry which demanded that we stop seeing things as separate solid objects with definite (simple) locations in space and time (Barrow 1992: 44). Yet it was knot-theory which provided a means of modelling the behaviour of delocalised, indefinite and mutually entangled entities that evolve like organisms. Like organisms, knots have the capacity for self-organisation (Adams 1994), are multi-dimensional and continuously evolving as projec- tions into a multiplicity of space-times. The visualisation of topological relations More than anything, it was the possibility of a non-Euclidian conception of space that is not ego-centred and not anthropomorphic which excited mathematicians, artists and anthropologists alike well into this century. Visualisation has always played an important role in mathematics, with new visual techniques resulting from the availability of new visual tools. More recently, a new branch of mathematics developed which uses com- puter modelling as imaging technology. In developing computer-driven visualisation, mathematicians have for long drawn on art to enrich the awareness of visualisation techniques. Artists likewise have visualised 'intuitions' which are the result of abstract reasoning, sometimes surpris- ingly parallelling mathematical constructs made visible in computer gen- erated imagery. Still today in the computer age, the common interest of art and mathematics is the visualising of the fourth dimension which became possible only at the end of the nineteenth century with the development of a graphic system known as 'hypersolids' published by Irving Stringham in 1880 in the American Journal of Mathematics as a set of illustrations entitled 'Regular Figures in n-Dimensional Space' (Banchoff 1990). Computer modelling itself was inspired by works such as those pro- duced by the American artist David Brisson, who developed the concept of hypersolids in the 1950s by producing perspective and orthogonal pro- jection drawings as well as three dimensional models of four dimensional polytopes (Brisson 1978). His hyper anaglyph, a four-dimensional form pro- jected onto three dimensions, established him as the leader in the visuali- sation of higher solids. In 1975, he coined the term hypergraphics which came to denote concept and technical process which transcended tradi- tional methods of making image by methods of visualisation that could 6</page><page sequence="7">From art to mathematics: lessons learned from the net blend contemporary thinking in art and science. Much of the hypergraphic art work is mathematically precise and enhanced by materials, colours, surfaces, textures, methods of construction and so on. Yet knot-theory as the conceptual basis of hypergraphic work began to capture the essence of topology not just for mathematicians and artists. Three psychoanalysts, Winnicott (1971), Laing (1970) and Lacan (1977, cf. Turkle 1981), known as the theoreticians of 'affective psychology', saw in string and knots a metaphor for a 'topology of social relations'. For Winnicott, the use of string in play is a way of dealing with a fear of separation: String can be looked upon as an extension of all other techniques of communication. String joins, just as it also helps in the wrap- ping up of objects and in the holding of unintegrated material. In this respect, string has a symbolic meaning for everyone; an exaggeration of the use of string can easily belong to a sense of insecurity or the idea of a lack of communication ... the function of the string is changing from communication into a denial of separation (1971: 19). Laing (1970) utilised the knot as a visualisation of the complexity of inter-personal relations. His book, Knots, describes in poetic form the intri- cacies and confusions that often arise between people: The patterns delineated here have not yet been classified by a Linnaeus of human bondage. They are all, perhaps, strangely familiar. In these pages I have confined myself to laying out only those I actually have seen. Words come to mind to name them are: Knots, tangles, fankles, impasses, disjunctions, whirligogs, binds ... I could have distilled them further towards an abstract logico-mathematical calculus (Laing 1970: iv). Finally, Lacan (1977) made use of knots in his formulation of the math- eme: of the four components representing aspects of the psyche: the imagi- nary, the real, the symbolic, and the symptom (Turkle 1981: 237). Refusing the dichotomy between the scientific and the poetic, Lacan uses the knot to explore the psychoanalytic role of mathematical theory. Doing the theo- ry - working on the knots, practising the manipulations - enters as an integral element, indeed, the critical element in the emergence of insight about the self, in the same sense that the psychoanalytic insight grows out of the lived relationship with an analyst. In contrast to psychology, art and mathematics, anthropology has failed to tackle the implications of knot-theory for its own disciplinary 7</page><page sequence="8">Susanne Kuchler understanding of spatial conception and the modelling of social relations. This is partially because it, possibly correctly, perceives the mathematical and artistic exploration of the knot as a kind of pre-cultural metaphor and figuration of a quasi-universal integration of spheres of experience. Its inhibition to regard knotted things as objects of analysis, however, also stems from its continuing to believe in spatial conception as 'relative, ego- centric and anthropomorphic'. The universality of this essentially New- tonian conception of space was only recently questioned by Wassmann (1994) in his study of the Yupno of Papua New Guinea who, as he argues, use three different reference systems at the same time. Thus, with the exception of a branch of anthropology known as ethnomathematics, the appeal of the knot for anthropology is still confined largely to its materiali- ty - mostly string or cord which tend to metaphorise maternally derived bodily reproduction - and its function, tying, which tends to be associated with sorcery (MacKenzie 1991; Gell 1998). No one has in this sense better revealed the importance ascribed to binding than Valeri in his work on the king's sacrifice in Hawaii (1985: 296-300). In Hawaii, a sacred cord ('aha) acted as reference point of geneal- ogy, representing not just the king's relationship with the gods, but also the connecting force of genealogy that 'binds together all other genealo- gies, since it is their reference point and the locus of their legitimacy and truth' (ibid.: 296). The cord of Hawaiian kingship was not inherited, the undoing of the King's sacred cord dissolving the social bond embodied by the king. The strands obtained from the undoing of the cords were woven into caskets in which the bones of the king are enshrined (ibid.: 298). During the king's reign, the weaving of the cord which celebrated his installation was re-enacted repeatedly as the central organising rite of the sacrifice of the king. The metaphoric or real 'twisting' of the strands that make up the 'aha cord enclosed and thereby removed from sight the space where the knot resides, containing and thus arresting the divine powers which come to form the mystical body of kingship. The Hawaiian sacred cord thus effected a contiguous relation with divinity, in so far as it does not represent through resemblance, but asso- ciative or contiguous link. In Valeri's words, the king's 'cord' ('aha) is in fact also the 'association' or 'congre- gation' ('aha) of nobles. The cord becomes the community; the link that connects the king with the social bond itself (ibid.: 296-297). In braiding his sacred cords the king braids social relationships, or, as Valeri puts it, 'binds men with his cords' (ibid.: 298). The king's title reflects 8</page><page sequence="9">From art to mathematics: lessons learned from the net the idea that he is the 'binder ', as haku or 'ruler' means 'to weave', 'to put in order', 'to compose a chant'. Valeri extends the political function ascribed weaving or binding to the poetic function of chants which are col- lectively composed by those whom the king tied to himself, thus becom- ing a bond that, bound in the memory of all, binds them all (ibid.: 299). The 'weaving' of the chants, like the weaving of the cords, is thus 'also an intellectual weaving, since social relations are reconstituted by the reproduction of the ideas that are their correlate and justification' (ibid.). The cord thus evokes, according to Valeri, social bond, memory, but also transformation as it can be used to tie and untie as made evident in string games which are used, so Valeri states, 'to represent mythical transforma- tions or even to produce ritual ones' (ibid.). The unvarying element of two opposing states (tied and untied) represented by the cord, permits thus the representation of the passage from one to the other: from the inaccessibili- ty of divine nature to its desacralised state in myth and ritual, or from sickness to healing. Such eloquent concern with binding is rare in anthropology despite Miriam MacKenzie's (1991) study of looped net-bags in Papua New Guinea. The exploration, collecting and cataloguing of bound artefacts appears to belong to the history of anthropology when they served to visu- alise otherwise unrecordable aspects of culture involving spatial cognition. Among such technologies which externalised spatial cognition, string fig- ures received unique attention in the collections and documentations of the turn of the century. Though they count among the forgotten exemplars of collections today, more articles were published about string figures in the first fifty years of this century than about any other item in ethnographic museums. Haddon's collection consisted of eight string figures which he presented to the British Museum in 1889 after his first visit to the Torres Straits in 1888. Sewn onto sheets of card, the string figures are quite small and it appears that each loop of string was used to form a cat's cradle and was then lifted from the maker's hand and sewn 'flattened' onto a sheet of card to preserve a two-dimensional form of the original three-dimensional string figure. Haddon's cat's cradles did not exist only as strings sewn onto card, but also as figures, as text and as drawings (Eastrop n.d.). About fifty were published as figures with additional textual descriptions and illustra- tions and many more were collected as texts and diagrams in Haddon's second expedition, with many publications documenting the songs and actions accompanying the figures following in the first decades of the twentieth century. However, with the rise of the linguistic model in the 1950s, the interest in the visualising of spatial cognition, and thus also in string figures, waned in anthropology and has even today not been fully rediscovered in the new branch of cognitive anthropology. 9</page><page sequence="10">Susanne Kuchler What is 'in the net' for anthropology and ethnographic museums? The question is how anthropology and ethnographic museums can realise for their own ends the cognitive and affective purchase of the net which has began to be commonplace in the intellectual economy of the late twen- tieth century. The belated discovery of the net by anthropology is the result of a number of impasses, as already forcefully pointed out by Gell (1998): anthropology has the unfortunate tendency to apply the nineteenth century definition of art and craft to artefacts, the tendency to ignore mod- ernism and its affinity with the anthropology of art, the tendency to apply two-dimensional techniques of representation to three-dimensional things and the tendency to ignore transformation in n-dimensional space. Stills are given priority in cataloguing over the representation of process, exter- nal forms over internal and fluid mechanics. Knotted things, however, display formal properties that do not easily fit the criteria laid down by a system of cataloguing and ethnographic doc- umentation that is increasingly geared up to be consumer friendly in allowing for the quick scroll through on the screen. This is partly because they are rather bland from a visual point of view, suggesting a duplicity of tedium and magic. The complexity which we suspect to underlie this duplicity is suspected to reside in the context surrounding their display and use, rather than in the technical aspects of form. A good example of such a kind of artefact which has been brilliantly contextualised and yet has escaped scrutiny is the to' o of Tahiti (Babadzan 1993). The to' o (Plate 1) is a composite object, in general made of a piece of hard wood, in elongated shape like a stick or club, of about several cen- timetres in length to 1.80 metres for the most important piece. This stick remains completely invisible, because the wood is covered in a tight bind- ing of sennit cordage called 'aha like the Hawaiian sacred cord. The bind- ing is made of plaits of cords from the fibres of the coconut tree and/or different layers of wrapped up tapa, the whole comprising feathers of dif- ferent colours, but mainly red, that are placed either outside the to'o, or between the wooden frame of the object and its different layers of wrap- ping. The mummy-like object is decorated on the outside with roughly delineated facial features and limbs woven out of sennit cordage. We tend to resist temptation to probe further into these casts, as they appear just to be functional: a means for containing divine power in ways that allow for its repeated release when the cast is removed. Surely no one can be blamed for this bypassing of the thing itself as one can't make out how it might be made even when seeing the thing itself, as usual, behind glass in an exhibition. We leave the worry of how the thing is made to the conservator. That it is indeed knotted appears a trivial part of the grand 10</page><page sequence="11">From art to mathematics: lessons learned from the net role we assume, and are quickly assured, it played in ritual and politics. And even if we realise that it is knotted, how could we be so impertinent as to assume that our preoccupation with and ideas about knots would have been appreciated by the Tahitian who once made the to' o we have come to see? The analytical possibilities just pass by in a flash: could the vary- ing surfaces of to'o figures be indicative of projections of a knot, thus externalising in a subtle manner the complex system of status differentiation and continu- ity so well described by Babadzan (1993)? Could the knot be exter- nalising concepts of space/time which are non-geometrical, but topological: folded rather than lin- ear, percolating rather than flow- ing (cf. Serres 1995: 58-60)? Who knows? No one has asked. Yet we know that concep- tually it is indeed possible and quite apt to explore the formal qualities of the knot in figurai space. Platel to 'o, Tahiti. ©British Museum. MM00B42. Mathematically speaking, a knot is a knotted loop of string, except that we think of the string as having no thickness, its cross-section being a sin- gle point.3 The knot is then a closed curve in space that does not intersect itself anywhere. There are two insights developed in knot-theory that war- rant mention here. The first fact is that, while there are a large number of distinct knots, such as the so called un-knot, the trefoil knot or the figure- eight-knot, each knot can undergo deformations known in knot-theory as projections. The second fact lies in the observation that essential for under- standing and distinguishing knots is the surface or the space around the knot. The space around the knot is everything but the knot; with the knot lying within or beneath the surfaces which make it visible to the eye. Mathematically speaking, therefore, all the surfaces that we look at live in 11</page><page sequence="12">Susanne Kuchler Plate 2 Brent Collins: One-Sided Surface with Opposed Cheiralities. Oiled cedar. 750 x 300 x 10 mm. © G. Francis. the complement of the knot. In plain English, this just means that the knot usually appears to us as a planar surface which, when aligned in a series, constitutes a visually impenetrable plane. As the knot is contained within the negative space created by surfaces, it lends itself formidably to be applied to the conceptualisation of sculp- tural form. This was shown by the American artist Brent Collins, who has created a series of sculptures which amplify the rather unusual explicit application of knot theory to wood (Plate 2). Wood is a rigid substance, so 12</page><page sequence="13">From art to mathematics: lessons learned from the net much so that it is difficult to imagine a surface carved from wood as hav- ing the quality of stretchable rubber. Yet many of his pieces display invari- ant symmetrical relations and uniform thickness from which one can abstract closed, knotted and linked ribbons curving through space (Francis 1993: 59). The mathematical surface depicted by his artworks indeed con- stitutes a knot-spanning surface or a 'framed link/ with the knot literally being carved out of the wood and constituting the hollow, negative space of the sculpture. In a recent paper in an edition of mathematical art, Fran- cis analyses Collins's sculpture as 'spanning an "unlinked link", which looks like a figure-8, and Listing's knot, which is also called figure-8 knot after the shape of the isotopie deformation of it' (ibid.: 61). Variations in sculptural form are carried out by Collins in tracing the six possible differ- ent surfaces spanning the Listing's knot. When will we start to look again at what we thought we knew, and how are we to assist those who want to look? Notes 1.
