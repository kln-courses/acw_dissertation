<plain_text><page sequence="1">The trampled foe: Two new examples of a rare amuletic form* Two unpublished faience amulet fragments from the University of Pennsylvania Museum, which depict foreign enemies trampled underfoot, are discussed. From the Egyptian collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology come two partially preserved, faience figurines or amulets, accession numbers 29—84—512 and 29—84—530. Each of the fragments depicts a pair of striding, anthropomorphic feet that stand atop the backs of two smaller enemy figures, which lie bound and prone upon a rectangular base. The two figurines are preserved only up to the striding ankles. The pieces were excavated by Henry Fischer for the Eckley B. Coxe Expedition to Memphis (Mit Rahina) in 19161 and 1919,2 respectively. The figures derive from a stratum dated to c.700 BC, located atop the destroyed Nineteenth Dynasty palace of Merneptah.3 The pieces were discovered along with numerous amulets and amulet moulds, in a locus identified by the excavators as a faience workshop.4 Object no. 29-84—512 (fig. i)5 was moulded in a distinctive, light blue faience; a substantial orange patina now covers most of the inner edges of the incised decoration. The horizontal placement of the prone enemies on the base is staggered, corresponding to the position of the striding feet, which trample them. The striding feet are bare. The head of the enemy on the right rests 8 mm behind the front edge of the base, with the feet nearly abutting the base's rear edge.6 The head of the enemy on the left rests 0.6 mm behind the front edge of the base, with feet approximately 3.4 mm from the rear edge. The tip of the toes on the striding figure's right foot reach the top of the corresponding enemy's buttocks; the toes of the extended left foot reach the back of the head of the enemy on the left. The enemies' knees bend upward slightly with the toes of the feet pressed flush to the base, such that the smaller figures' feet appear to bend slightly forward, toward the shins. The enemies' arms are bound at the elbow; the binding appears as a raised band across the lower back, above the buttocks. The forearms and hands are held back and to the sides, alongside the upper thighs. The enemies' heads are rendered crudely, with a minimum of detail. Hairline, nose, and chin have been indicated with simple incised lines; the eyes appear as raised orbs. Due to the cursory nature of the decoration, the enemies' nationality cannot be determined with complete certainty. However, the elongated facial features, with the chin stretched forward, I extend my thanks to Dr. David P. Silverman, curator in charge of the University of Pennsylvania Museum's Egyptian collection, for permission to publish these two pieces; and to the collection's keeper, Dr. Jennifer Wegner, whose invitation to assist in the updating of the artifact records led to my happening upon the objects in question.

A thick, brown patina fills much of the interior surfaces of the incised decoration. The back of the piece breaks off just behind the striding figure's toes on the right and behind the ankle of the extended left foot.10 The legs, feet, and exterior arm of the enemy on the right fell beyond this break and are no longer extant.11 The arms of the enemy on the left are bound at the mid-point of the upper arm. The binding appears as a shallow indention in the figure's arms, as contrasted with the raised binding observed in the preceding piece. The exterior forearm and hand bend sharply forward, pressed flush to the base.12 The head of the left-hand enemy reaches to the front of the base; that of the right-hand figure stops approximately 0.7 cm behind the base, roughly even with the occiput of its counterpart on the left. The hairstyle, elongated face, and pointed beard of the figure on the right identify him as an Asiatic captive. The more rounded head and facial features of the beardless enemy on the left, in clear contrast to those of the Asiatic figure, are characteristically Nubian. Representations of the king or gods sitting, standing, striding or otherwise trampling upon personifications of Egypt's traditional enemies or their symbolic equivalent13 are a frequently occurring and long-lived feature of pharaonic iconography.14 The trampling of enemies occurs, for example, as a motif on statues and statue bases,15 as an architectural element,16 and in two dimensional representations on the soles of sandals, coffins, and the like.17 Works of minor statuary, consisting primarily of amulets and figurines similar to the objects under discussion,'8 include standing, striding, and seated figures, which trample either the complete bodies of prone enemies19 or, less often, their heads alone.20 9 Preserved length: 2.4 cm; width: 1.87 cm; preserved height: 1.48 cm. The base of the figurine measures 5 mm thick on the left and 4.7 mm thick on the right, exhibiting a clear, downward slope from left to right and front to back. 10 The big and little toes of the left foot are set back noticeably farther that the three central digits; cf. the more naturalistic disposition of the toes in fig. 1. 11 The area where the interior arm would be is filled instead by the enemy and striding foot on the left. 12 Details of the interior arm and hand are obscured by the brown patina. 13 For example, in the representation of the 'Nine bows' as literal bows; see E. Uphill, 'The Nine Bows', JEOL 6 (1967), 393-420; D. Valbelle, Les neuf arcs (Paris, 1990), 43-52, and passim. 14 For the symbolic significance and historical development of the trampling motif as a mechanism for 'the ritual destruction of the enemies of Egypt', see R.

Rows of enemy heads occur as an architectural motif already in the Old Kingdom: see B. Bothmer, 'On Realism in Egyptian Funerary Sculpture of the Old Kingdom', Expedition 24/2 (1982), 37-9 and figs 27-30; the underlying concept of 'architecturally' crushing the bound enemy may be traced back at least as far as the First Dynasty: Ritner, Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice, 117-18, citing door sockets from Hierakonpolis in the form of bound prisoners (University of Pennsylvania Museum, E 3959), amongst other objects. 17 Cf. examples discussed in Ritner, Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice, 123-6, figs 6-8. 18 The survey in Wildung, AfO 24, 108-116, provides a concise introduction to the object type. 19 Ten examples in Wildung, AfO 24, 108, 113-14; with two additional examples in S. Schoske and D. Wildung, Gott und Götter im Alten Ägypten (Mainz am Rhein, 1992), 156-9, nos 107-8. 20 Two examples in C. Andrews, 'Pharaoh Trampler of Egypt's Enemies: A New Amuletic Form', in J. Phillips (ed.), Ancient Egypt, the Aegean, and the Near East: Studies in Honour of Martha Rhodes Bell (San Antonio, 1997), 39-42.</page><page sequence="4">222 BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS JEA 96 It is noteworthy that nearly all currently known amulets and small figurines representing trampled foreigners place both enemies at the same position relative to the base, with heads near the front edge and feet near the back edge. Conversely, the two examples in which heads alone are depicted21 both stagger the enemies' positions, in accordance with the placement of the trampling figures' feet. The two Philadelphia objects, with their inclusion of complete enemies staggered horizontally along the base, represent a hybrid form.22 With regard to the position of the enemy figures' arms, other standing or striding examples tend to show the forearms bent forward with palms flush to the base, similar to that of 29—84—530. However, the Philadelphia figurine modifies the posture through its placement of the forearm flush to the base, such that the elbow appears more broken than bent. 3 A similar posture occurs on an amulet from a private collection, depicting a striding lion goddess atop a pair of schematically rendered enemies.24 The rear-facing position of the bound arms as found on figure 29-84-512, on the other hand, occurs also on the Saite period striding bronze figurine cited in n. 22. A comparable posture occurs on a seated figurine in the Louvre,25 on an isolated enemy figure from a statue base in Brooklyn, and in the painting of an enemy beneath a royal statue from the tomb of Rekhmire.26 Given the relatively small number of known amulets and figurines depicting the trampled foe, their frequently broken or otherwise incomplete state of preservation, and the lack of excavated context for the majority of pieces, we cannot yet draw firm conclusions with regard to the date and provenance of such objects based solely on external characteristics. The relatively broad chronological spectrum of the attested examples (Eighteenth Dynasty through to the Late Period) and their appearance at major sites in Upper, Middle, and Lower Egypt suggest that the form may have enjoyed a greater popularity than the paucity of attested examples might otherwise suggest. It is hoped that future excavation or discovery of hitherto unpublished pieces might shed additional light on the diachronic evolution of this intriguing form. Joshua Roberson 21 Andrews, in J. Phillips (ed.), Studies in Honour of Martha Rhodes Bell, 39-42. 22 Cf. also a roughly contemporary Saite bronze, now in the Louvre, depicting a striding, Hawk-headed figure atop staggered enemies in A. Vigneau (ed.), Encyclopédie photographique de l'art (Paris, 1936), pl. 119, right; G. Roeder, Ägyptischen Bronzefiguren (MÄSB 6; Berlin, 1956), §§ 11 ib, 395a, 677a. 23 The exterior elbow of the enemy on the left bends nearly ninety degrees downward, followed by an additional bend before the plane of the forearm begins to run more or less parallel with the base (see fig. 2, upper left). 24 Grimm, Wildung, and Schoske, Pharao: Kunst und Herrschaft, 24, n. 9. 25 Louvre 3819, discussed in Wildung, AfO 24, 113 and figs 13-14. 26 For the Brooklyn figure and the Rekhmire painting, see n. 15.</page></plain_text>
