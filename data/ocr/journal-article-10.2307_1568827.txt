<plain_text><page sequence="1">by HANNAH LE ROUX INTRODUCTION ..an architecture and form of urbanism will emerge closely connected with the set of ideas that have international validity, but reflecting the conditions of climate, the habits of the people and the aspirations of the countries lying under the cloudy belt of the equatorial world. Max Fry and Jane Drew, architects, -19561 The concept of architecture, even in its widest traditional sense, is foreign to Africa. John Lloyd, architect, 19662 Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, who had been in and out of West Africa since the 1L9405 as planners and architects, were optimistic about the role of architecture in the tropics on the eve of independence. In the text of Tropical Architecture in the Humid Zones they championed the development in Africa of the tropical modernism they had pioneered in their own work. In sharp contrast, John Lloyd, writing from Ghana just ten years later, conveyed a sense of the discipline's estrangement from the context. The timing of the comments relates to two critical moments in West African history. On 5 April 1957 the British West African colony of the Gold Coast became Ghana, the first sub-Saharan nation in Africa to reclaim independent rule. Within three years Nigeria too, along with sixteen other African countries, was independent. Oversailing Ghana's celebrations was an aluminium dome, designed by Fry and Drew's partner, Denys Lasdun, and shipped out from an English port in time for the occasion. By 1966, less than a decade later, the leadership of both West African countries had been deposed by military coups. Ghana's Prime Minister, Kwame Nkrumah, had fled to Guinea and Nigeria's Prime Minister had been executed. The role of architecture within national affairs had been transformed. In the western media, 'the interest in modern tropical architecture of the -195os had faded away. Despite the absences in Western media and, in several cases, the departure of British expatriate architects from post-colonial West Africa, the architectural profession had not entirely stopped work in Ghana and Nigeria. Between the period of the 1950s, the era in which the campuses of lbadan and Kumasi, and many tropical school buildings were commissioned, and the mid-i96os, the volume of built work did not diminish. Instead it seems that the orthodoxy of earlier decade was replaced by a fragmentation of approaches, leading to diverse forms of expression and practice. In response to the cultural, political and economic changes which accompanied independence, several architects, both expatriate and Africans, tried to review their norms and construct new paths and references for discipline.</page><page sequence="2">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 After 1966 conditions in both Ghana and Nigeria became more difficult for architects, and in some ways the momentum of the experimentation which took place in the brief post-colonial period covered here was lost. Yet the decade remains of ongoing interest as a telling reflection of the post-colonial identity of the profession and discourse of architecture. Two interdependent strands of thinking were in dialogue during this time when, as Fry and Drew had predicted, a growing number of professionals from West Africa entered practice. At the same time, expatriate professionals began to radically question their own contributions and in some cases, the Western biases within their discipline. This paper outlines four areas of activity in the modern architecture of Ghana and Nigeria during the first post-colonial decade. By examining in some detail the built or theoretical work of two practices, a critic and a school, it describes the diversity and creativity with which individuals approached the transforming circumstances of the post-colonial period. The period is one is which a fair volume of discursive material in the form of publications, professional gatherings, educational theory and exhibitions in excess of the profession's fee-paying work was produced. In this sense it is both rich in archival material and a fascinating reflection of an avant-garde in the sense defined by Tafuri,4 a movement which responds to circumstances beyond its normal ambit of reference. In selecting four particular areas of work for documentation, this paper omits some important aspects of practice in the period. The large increase in commercial work, particularly the design of private factories, banks and infrastructure for the oil industry, was an important aspect of Nigerian practice for some architects in the i96os.5 In Ghana, civil work on the Volta River project and harbours was a key part of the building industry. A major town planning exercise was commissioned for Kaduna in Nigeria from the British planner Max Lock.6 In omitting these areas of work the paper will necessarily paint a selective picture of activity in order to focus more clearly on work which was self-consciously engaged with the redefinition of architectural practice in relation to public culture. FOUR SITES Oluwole Olumuyiwa (1929-2000) was one of the first generation of architects born in Nigeria and Ghana, and the first to open a private practice. A picture of Olumuyiwa in front of his Crusader House development is included in Udo Kultermann's book New Directions in African Architecture (1969) (Fig. i). Trained at Manchester, with a number of years of experience working in practice in Europe, he returned in 1958 to open a practice in competition with the expatriate architects who constituted the profession in Nigeria at the time. In the same year he was involved in the formation of the Nigerian Institute of Architects.7 In terms of his training, he represents a transitional figure whose professional background is comparable to that of his colonial predecessors. Somewhat ironically, he stated his resistance to a concept of regionalism in design. At the same time, his professional activities through institutional work and his collaborations with international firms reflect a commitment to developing the role of African architects within large projects. 362</page><page sequence="3">GHANA AND NIGERIA Fig. i. Oluwole Olumuyiwa outside Crusader House (Olumuyiwa archive) As a British-born counterpart and an acquaintance of Olumuyiwa's, Alan Vaughan- Richards (1925-89) (Fig. 2), was an architect with an exceptional interest in his context as a cultural resource. In response to personal and political changes Vaughan-Richards evolved his field of reference beyond colonial and modernist norms in order to admit the influence of an African environment and clientele. His thinking is reflected in a number of articles written for the journal, the West African Builder and Architect, a paper given to students at the University of Lagos on the occasion of an exhibition of his work and a book on Lagos he co-authored with Prince Kunle Akinsemoyin.8 His writing and approach to projects represent an eclectic interest in indigenous architecture and its uses. At different moments he referred to African earth technology, conducted 'native' dress studies for Jaja Hall, and commissioned Nigerian artists in his buildings. Vaughan-Richards was also active in the Nigerian Institute of Architects and, in 1970, went into partnership with a Nigerian architect, Roye Ibru. Events in the institutional sites of the universities reflected changes in the West African context as much as the careers of architects in private practice did. Ulli Beier (Fig. 3), although not an architect, showed paths in his work as a cultural figure which in some ways run parallel to Vaughan-Richard's search for alternative thinking to 363</page><page sequence="4">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 Fig. 2.

As a teacher, curator and critic, Beier's involvement with Nigerian architecture in the 1960s was largely critical, while his patronage served as a channel whereby African artists began to engage, often to create a formal counterpoint, in relation to professionally constructed built space. During the same period, in Nkrumah's Ghana, the transformation of the Kumasi school under the headship of John Lloyd created new expressive and disciplinary approaches in response to national developmental discourses (Fig. 4). Apart from serving as a meeting point for international figures, the school also shaped the future careers of young architects and planners. The connexions between these moments, where they exist, are built on the social and professional connexions between individuals. For instance, the Bristol Hotel, on which Vaughan-Richards worked, included mosaics and murals commissioned from artists associated with Ulli Beier. The 1960 Independence Exhibition, curated by Beier, showed both these artists and the work of architectural practices including Godwin and Hopwood. Vaughan-Richards and Olumuyiwa were professionally acquainted and, in the 1950S, worked together in London for the Architects' Co-Partnership. A common point of reference for all the architects was their initial schooling in modernism in England. Beier, who was from a German background, had a somewhat less academic connexion with modem architecture through his posting to the University of Ibadan, where the campus plan and many buildings designed by Fry and Drew were being built. ; ::? i: ? 365</page><page sequence="6">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 Despite the connexions between individuals and with the modern movement, the diversity of formal and disciplinary approaches in the 196os stands in contrast to the orthodoxy, in the same context, of the 1950S tropical architecture. Kultermann's books9 and The Architectural Review's Commonwealth Architecture survey10 showed how many practices in the first post-war decade, including Godwin and Hopwood, Nickson and Borys, Kenneth Scott, Fry and Drew, and Becker and Voight were working in a modernist idiom with minimalist detailing, flat roofs, screen walls and rectangular volumes. In formal and conceptual terms this body of built work corresponds with the norms for tropical modernism which were verbalized in Fry and Drew's books11 and various journals published in the metropolis.12 Fry and Drew's definition of tropical architecture was of a regional style attuned to the people, materials and climate of a zone.13 In practice, the emphasis was on climate. For instance, their project for the University College, Ibadan (1951-55) shows a particular concern for the adaptation of modernist form to perform climatically, while the materials (concrete, steel windows, metal sheeting) and the programme (under the direction of University College, London) were largely imported. The climatic response worked at two levels, in the siting of buildings, and in their sectional treatment. At Ibadan, the density of the programme meant that buildings were grouped in courtyards. However, as in the Faculty of Arts, the courtyard plan form was adapted to allow a breeze into the courtyard by the positioning of high buildings on the north and south sides, and single-storied buildings on the east and west. The most influential and common element of tropical architecture was a cross- sectional form which responded to sun and wind. The basic arrangement for many buildings was a flat roofed, rectangular block, one room wide with an open access corridor. The long, glazed elevation was oriented towards the north or south, with louvres, canopies or balconies used to control solar ingress, and pivoting or louvre windows used to admit breezes. It is hard to characterize the work of Olumuyiwa, Vaughan-Richards and the Kumasi School, or the thinking of Beier, within a formal category corresponding to the orthodoxy of tropical architecture. Although in schematic ways their approaches to design often drew closely on tropical architecture, with concerns that buildings respond climatically to a hot, humid weather pattern, their work went well beyond the expressive range of tropical architecture. In quite different ways, each practice drew aspects of indigenous material culture or lived space into their formal repertoire. In describing more closely, and singularly, some of the projects which these individuals undertook as architects and theorists, it seems that they were also engaging with the development of an architectural expression which contested the limits of modernist architecture at the time. In one respect this tendency situates their work within a localized cultural sphere. The project to expand cultural expression to include African tropes is allied to the notions of Africanism and negritude which were an important part of cultural discourse in Africa from the 1950S onwards. At the same time, the movement toward a more complete architectural vocabulary, one which retrieved the qualities of place, materiality and sensuality that had been repressed in the pre-war modernist vocabulary, was significant within Western and other non-Western post-war modernisms, too. In this respect the work represents an engagement with an 366</page><page sequence="7">GHANA AND NIGERIA increasingly mobile professional discourse which, though journals and individual travel, linked individuals working in different countries. Without underplaying the importance of external influences on each of these sites of practice, it is the impact of Africanist thinking and West African material history that is of concern here. In describing these influences, the interlinked cultural and material histories of the post-colonial states of Ghana and Nigeria needs to be briefly outlined. AFRICANIST HISTORIES AND FRAMEWORKS In 1957, the Gold Coast became Ghana, the first nation in Africa south of the Sahara to regain its independence from a European colonizer. Nigeria became an independent federation of three states in 1961. Although the handing over of independence came quickly for some observers, it has been argued that the British approach to colonialism of indirect rule had always supported a certain amount of self government through the agency of local chiefs and later, through political parties.14 Certainly, in Ghana as in Nigeria, political parties had formed, been installed through elections and their leadership been involved in government from earlier in the decade before independence. Some of the political decisions which directly affected architectural practice had been effected through indirect rule during the late-colonial period. For instance, after (the future prime minister) Nkrumah became leader of government business in the Gold Coast in 1951 he scrapped the existing colonial development plan, with a budget of ?11 million, in favour of a five-year plan in which ?120 million was allocated to develop a college of technology at Kumasi as well as roads, bridges, harbours and free compulsory primary education.15 The college was designed by James Cubitt and Partners, and appeared in several journals.16 After independence the Ghanain government relied on the services of foreign experts in planning. One report stressed the role of agriculture as an economic and developmental sector, apparently to the disappointment of the Prime Minister who envisioned a nation transformed through socialist industrial and commercial ventures. Several of these were established in the mining, milling, fishing, building, airline and banking sectors. Most were costly exercises. Two large engineering projects which were half funded by the state, a dam to harness hydro-electricity on the Volta and an associated aluminium smelter at Tema, were amongst the capital projects which drained the economy without much direct return. Ghana's income was largely derived from cocoa exports and although the new nation had considerable resources, the falling cocoa price from 1961 onwards and the considerable government spending led to a severe deficit by the mid-196os.17 The financial crises in Ghana in the mid-196os manifested themselves in high food prices and shortages, and were a factor in the success of a coup by military officers in 1966. Nkrumah was out of the country at the time, and remained in exile until his death. Although his rule has been seen as despotic and his projects financially damaging to the subsequent development of the country, his thinking, articulated in a number of speeches, an autobiography and books,18 was highly influential within and beyond Ghana. Nkrumah's vision for his nation's development was one in which cultural and political systems would be related to each other in a modernizing context. His speeches 367</page><page sequence="8">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 had a pragmatic tone, accepting the hybrid nature of modern African society, in which Islamic and Euro-Christian influences worked alongside traditional ones. Although he was not dismissive of the value of indigenous structures he disagreed with some of his contemporaries, including Leopold Senghor, who felt these offered a model for contemporary society.19 For Nkrumah, a more important value amongst the positive qualities of 'traditional African society' (his apostrophes) than its communalism was its humanist impulse. In contemporary Africa, this could find parallels in guaranteeing individuals opportunities for development through a 'scientific system' of socialism. Nkrumah's enthusiasm for technological innovation and the power of his government to pursue developmental projects in the early 196os created opportunities for the implementation of planning projects and mass housing which were experimental in nature. The construction in 1962 of an innovative block of junior staff housing by the Ministry of Works at Christianborg Castle,20 effectively on the prime minister's doorstep, indicates at least a tacit approval of design as an instrument of social betterment. In a speech on the eve of independence, Nkrumah explicitly praised the work in passive cooling being done by researchers in building science at the College of Technology in Kumasi.21 While the assent of the Prime Minister created an enabling environment for experimental technology and planning in post-colonial Ghana, the political system discouraged the development of private enterprise. In contrast to Nigeria, where work for commercial interests dominated the market for architectural services, the only route to building was through state or parastatal projects. Although the commercial sector was buoyant, the lack of political unity in Nigeria posed its own problems for development. Independence had been achieved through a fragile consensus of a spectrum of political parties which (unofficially) represented Northern, Igbo and Yoruba interests. In the following two years a realignment of parties created tensions which came to the head in 1965 with attacks between rival groups. The collapse of law and order led to a military coup in January 1966 in which the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and the Premiers of the Northern and Western Regions were executed. The military government installed after the coup was short lived; perceived as promoting an Igbo plan for domination, it was deposed in July 1966 and a Northerner, Major General Gowon, emerged as head of state. The aftermath came in a civil war as Eastern Region, calling itself Biafra, tried to secede from the Federation. The war lasted nearly three years, causing massive displacement and famine in the region. Although oil had been discovered by BP-Shell in the delta of Nigeria in the late 1950os, the large-scale development of the fields only started in earnest after the war. As a result, with the restructuring of the federation in the later i96os, revenues from oil began to reach the federal government, creating an economy which could embark on centrally planned capital projects. In the interim, the programmes of the 1950s, intended to build or expand ecumenical secondary schools and universities, had wound down without replacement. Ghana and Nigeria also faced pressing urban problems. Growing rates of urbanization affected the major towns and cities, made worse by the displacement of people due to the dam building in the upper Volta valley and the war in Biafra. Both countries faced a shortage of qualified technical staff to plan and administer the new 368</page><page sequence="9">GHANA AND NIGERIA governments. To address this, the colleges at Ibadan and Kumasi were upgraded to universities. The first local graduates in architecture qualified in the early 196os. At the same time a shift in patronage began in both countries. In Nigeria, the opportunities for entrepreneurial activity resulted in an emergent class of clients for architects while in both countries, for the first time, architects and planners were responding to an autonomous African client in government. Architecture played a role in forming symbols of progress around the time of independence in both countries. In Nigeria, skyscrapers were built in Ibadan, where Cocoa House, funded with cocoa income, was the highest building in Africa, and in Lagos, where Independence House was designed by the public works department to overlook the city. An Independence Exhibition was held in Nigeria, and featured progressive designs including an aluminium geodisic dome designed by Godwin and Hopwood.22 The role of African architecture, or even of indigenous culture, within the symbolic language of built space in the newly independent countries was still nascent. At Jos, in Nigeria, a museum complex of different vernacular housing styles was constructed with the advice of Zbigniew Dmochowski, the foremost scholar of Nigerian indigenous architecture,23 but the assimilation of African elements into the modern architectural language of the new states was not immediate. A number of important texts around the multiple concerns of an African intelligentsia were published around the time of independence. A particularly influential body of work concerning the role of the intellectual came in the work of Leopold Sedar Senghor, who, in defining the concept of negritude, put forward the idea of an African culture that is engaged with the 'living, throbbing unity of the universe'.24 Senghor, who became president of Senegal in 1960, was a French-educated intellectual, produced poetry, and was particularly supportive of the arts. While materialist thinkers, including Nkrumah, rejected Senghor's metaphysics, his interest in an African approach to intellectual and political leadership was commonly supported. An area of particular concern was the tension between Africanism and development. While the latter approach engaged with Western knowledge, through the process of education of individuals or the use of foreign technologies, critics such as Nkrumah argued that the body of Western knowledge debased Africa's own contributions to science.25 The process of education could turn Africans against their own culture and create ruptures between traditional values and the educated elite. Certainly such tendencies happened within architectural education, as was evidenced anecdotally by the uneasiness of students at Kumasi attending a course in African aesthetics. The Western-born practitioners and educators working in West Africa in the 196os showed an increasing sensitivity to such cultural questions. At the same time, their own identities, as foreigners, presented another set of challenges. In questioning the biases within their intellectual upbringing they were uprooting themselves from one system, while not necessarily finding themselves at home within another. Contemporary writing on the post-colonial condition26 recognizes these crises but, in interpreting the creative output of individuals caught between systems, places an emphasis on the capacity of people to project new, hybrid and unstable forms of culture into their worlds. In outlining the work of these architects and thinkers, the absence of a singular 369</page><page sequence="10">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 and resolved approach to the tensions between multiple African and Western solutions indicates that just such creativity was at play. OLUWOLE OLUMUYIWA Oluwole Olumuyiwa had trained within a modernist environment at Manchester University, between 1949 and 1954, graduating with a Diploma in Architecture and Certificate in Town Planning.27 For the next four years he visited and worked within a number of European practices, including the Architects' Co-Partnership, Van den Broek and Bakema in Rotterdam, and AKZ architects in Zurich. On his return to Nigeria in 1958 he elected to work as Olumuyiwa and Associates. The absence of other Nigerian architects in private practice was a legacy, on the one hand, of a lack of local training opportunities, and the lure of public service for those few architects who had trained abroad. Prior to independence, the first and only course in architectural education in Nigeria was run at Yaba Technical Institute from 1949, training architectural assistants.28 Only those students who went on to study abroad in the 1950S could become registered architects. The Yaba School was replaced with the College of Arts, Science and Technology at Ibadan, which in turn moved to Zaria in 1954. In 1962 this course finally became a route to professional registration with the change in status of the College to a University. Amongst the architects who had trained abroad, Olumuyiwa (in 1958) and Alex Ekwueme (in 1960) were the first to open their own practices. Michael Onafowokan, who qualified in Glasgow in 1947, Architect Egbor, Frank Mbanefo, and Adedokun Adeyemi were amongst the Nigerian architects working at the time in public offices.29 Olumuyiwa's first built projects include Crusader House (1958), Architecture House and the Municipal Primary School at Igbodi (1959), all in Lagos, and a Co-operative College in Ibadan. Crusader House is located in the centre of Lagos Island, adjacent to the market and close to the Bristol Hotel site (Fig. 5). It is a commercial development with shops onto the street and seven floors of offices. Although the facade allowed the discreet insertion of air conditioners along external shelves, the lower floors had full height pivot windows. The possibility of using the shelves as balconies is demonstrated in the photograph of Olumuyiwa standing outside his building. Around the same time Olumuyiwa developed a family house and office for himself, Architecture House, in the fashionable Lagos suburb of Ikoyi (1958-60). Although the house is now used as a language school, and the original plans are lost, Olumuyiwa commissioned a number of photographs around the time of its completion which allow the reconstruction of the public areas of the building.30 The house was approached from a side street of Awolowo Road, an important thoroughfare which links Lagos Island with the reclaimed area of Ikoyi (Fig. 6). While parts of Lagos Island were historically segregated, with most expatriates living in a government residential area, Ikoyi was developed much later and escaped such controls. Its proximity to Lagos Island made it a desirable area in which to live, and several of the houses built in the i96os mentioned here are located in Ikoyi. The passage from the street to the house was covered with an extended porch, leading between a swimming pool and an outside living area beneath the volume of the 370</page><page sequence="11">GHANA AND NIGERIA Fig. 5. Oluwole Olumuyiwa, Crusader House, Lagos, 1958, in the centre of the image, taken from the Bristol UE _ :dlZ Hotel, Lagos (The Architects' Co-Partnership, 1960). (Hannah le Roux) living room. A level change led to the entrance area, which occupies a glazed void between the house and office volumes. From the entrance, a spiral stair leads up into a mezzanine bridge that links to various reception rooms. An important concern in the planning of Architecture House lay in the provision of reception spaces.31 West African cultural practices necessitate the hosting of large gatherings from time to time to celebrate family occasions. In traditional settlements this would happen in areas distinct from private dwelling quarters, possibly in an outside court and below shade structures. In a modem house, the area conventionally given over to a living room would be too small for these functions. The planning of Architecture House gives over a series of physically separate spaces, staggered at different levels and thus intervisible, to reception functions, keeping their scale, if not their overall area, in accordance with the balance of the house. The public uses of the house reflect the architect's engagement with social structures within Nigerian urban culture. The house's design is strategically thought through in its highly visible location off an important and modem thoroughfare, as a space for the staging of social display, and as a support for interactions with guests. It works as a support for the architects' business and social ambitions within a culture which puts an emphasis on networking and symbolic displays of achievement. In an interview, the architect was at pains to explain that the house functions well for relaxation and entertainment, allowing people to be distributed on different levels. Moreover, the integration of these reception spaces with the office permitted it to be visible to social visitors. 371</page><page sequence="12">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 / / Fig. 6. Oluwole Olumuyiwa, Architecture House, Ikoyi, Lagos, 1960 (Olumuyiwa archives) The formal language which Olumuyiwa chose to work within remained close to the approaches in which he had been schooled, and that of the offices where he had worked. The buildings are generally composed of planar surfaces, arranged within a rectilinear grid, with low pitched roofs. The ornamentation of buildings is kept to a minimum. A photograph of a library building designed by Olumuyiwa in the 196os shows a pair of carved doors apparently executed by a local sculptor, but these are framed within a conventional modern facade. Similarly, the photographs of Architecture House show the inclusion of a number of locally sourced artefacts as furnishing or decoration: curtains from Ghanain Kente cloth, an animal skin rug, a mosaiced table (Fig. 7). As much as these are emblematic West African artefacts, the surrounding building is thoroughly modernist in its forms and materiality. The choice of an unequivocally modem formal language by an African architect can be read in a number of ways. Later in his career, Olumuyiwa indicated in an interview that Nigerian architecture had not arrived at a regional style, such as there was in Switzerland, Spain or Japan.32 It is unclear whether he felt that this was a stage within an evolutionary development, or whether, given the ethnic complexities of the Nigerian state, he found modernism to be an appropriately neutral ground for expression. His 372 -.. -1 v I .</page><page sequence="13">GHANA AND NIGERIA ; ::~i.5.... &lt;"W:~i:~'.* '~ &lt;Fig. 7. Oluwole Olumuyiwa, Architecture House, Ikoyi, Lagos, 1960, interior view (Olumuyiwa archives) interest in regional form, such as it was, lay in his adherence to motifs of tropical architecture. Climate was a dominant concern in design and cross-ventilation and water pools were important elements. In terms of these approaches, Olumuyiwa is close to the position of his colonial predecessors, including Fry and Drew and the Architects' Co- Partnership, in deriving a regional architecture from modernism through attention to climate. It would be wrong to see the mimicry of Western practices which is inherent in Olumuyiwa's career as a rejection of an African identity. His own dress code, for instance, showed his pride in traditional culture. His form of Africanism accepted the 'triple heritage'33 of Islamic, Western and African influences on contemporary African life, rather than espousing a neo-traditionalist view. He also engaged proactively with contemporary economic life, although he claimed not to be a businessman. In his professional life Olumuyiwa's position as an independent practitioner challenged the status quo of a profession which in 1958 was still dominated by expatriates. Within a short period of establishing his own practice he became involved in the foundation of 373</page><page sequence="14">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 a Nigerian Institute of Architects, the initial membership of which was confined to Nigerians. In so doing he called attention to the existence of Nigerians within the profession and began to negotiate for their engagement by public and Nigerian-owned institutions. His position brought personal and collective benefits to his career, as a number of international consortia engaged him in commissions in the late i96os and '7os.34 In 1970, it became mandatory for all firms to include Nigerians as partners or directors. ALAN VAUGHAN-RICHARDS Alan Vaughan-Richards (then Alan Richards) had first come to Nigeria in 1955 as a member of the Architects' Co-Partnership. The practice, founded by former students of the Architectural Association in 1939, was run with a strong social agenda, reflected in a collaborative working environment and the programmes of the buildings they designed. The firm, which attracted projects with a social programme and designed a number of educational buildings, including the college 'sets' for St John's College, Oxford, on which Vaughan-Richards worked in their London office between tours to Nigeria.35 The Nigerian office reported to Leo de Syllas but between visits Vaughan-Richards, promoted to an associate 'with his name on the letterhead'36 was responsible for preliminary designs and the supervision of jobs on site. The firm's commissions during his position there included the Bristol Hotel, housing for petrol companies and the 'tough, cheerful and cheap' Olowogbowo School in Lagos. The Architects' Co-Partnership withdrew from Nigeria in 1961. By that stage (Vaughan-)Richards, who had married Gladys Ayo Vaughan, a member of a prominent Lagos family, had become attached to Lagos and decided to stay. He took over some of the ACP commissions, and continued work on a small house for his own family on the edge of the lagoon in Ikoyi. Set next to the boundary of the site, it was intended as the guest house for a larger home which was never built. The plan of the Vaughan-Richards house was a line of five interocking circular rooms, culminating in a screened porch which overlooked the lagoon (Fig. 8). The house was probably the first modern, architect-designed building in Nigeria to draw from indigenous forms. The plan was inspired by Hausa villages, in which the circular forms of individual huts are linked together (Fig. 9). The sequence of rooms, with an office at the street end and the living room next to the lagoon, involved circulation through a second bedroom. Around the mid-196o0s37 a second floor, with an office and two bedrooms, was added to give privacy to the growing family. While the first part of the construction had used concrete block, the upper floor is made from timber. Outside, planks are used as siding while the interior is panelled in richly coloured hardwoods. The detailing of the spiral staircase leading to the upper level is quite ornamental, with a curved balustrade and shelf used for the display of local art including Ibeji figures. Other pieces of local craftsmanship include welded screens, possibly made by Ayo Bello, who executed similar work in other commissions by the architect, and also carved timber panels. A series of cement blocks with animal and abstract patterns, made by the architect himself, line the driveway. 374</page><page sequence="15">GHANA AND NIGERIA 375 Fig. 8.

Intended as a reception room for the numerous visitors who might be expected on a festive occasion, the form combined an indigenous circular plan with an avant-garde technology. After a busy period in 1961 when he designed three houses and a block of flats for Lagos University staff, Vaughan-Richards' practice was largely involved with individual houses for Nigerian clients. In two of the house projects, the Olaoluwakitan cottage on Awolowo Road, and the unbuilt Arekele House at Alagbon, Vaughan-</page><page sequence="16">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 Fig. io.

Both projects are designed under the influence of European expressionist tendencies, of which he explicitely cited Gaudi's Casa Mila, the Einstein Tower by Mendelsohn, the Chapel at Notre-Dame-du-Haut by Le Corbusier and Utzon's Sydney Opera House as influences. While finding inspiration in European architecture, Vaughan-Richards suggested that his interest in plasticity had an Africanist agenda: 'it seemed to me that the future lay in developing strong but economical plastic forms which could soon be calculated by the generations of computers. The place where plastic forms were used traditionally is Africa and I hope Africa could provide inspiration to the new architecture rather as Japanese architecture had influenced the Modem Movement which used flat sheet materials and designed with tee and set squares.'38 The first house was referred to by the architect as the house at Alagbon.39 Designed for Mr Areleke, it was abandoned as a concept and a second version was designed for a site at Ikeja. In both versions, the house plan combines curved and rectilinear geometries. In the version for the Alagbon site, Vaughan-Richards proposed moulded roof forms and to test these he built a third-scale model as a play sculpture at the University of Lagos flats in Ikoyi (Fig. lo). In an article describing the projects, Vaughan-Richards credits an engineering practice only on the second version. In a talk on his work, he suggests that the experiments with curved structures were premature, 'causing Obi Obembe, the 376</page><page sequence="17">GHANA AND NIGERIA structural engineer, to have many sleepless nights'. The critical problem was the absence of a computer on which to draw and analyze the building's structure. The Olaoluwakitan cottage, completed around 1965, was the more conventional project of the two houses.40 The plan is rectilinear, and only the section, expressed on the lateral facades, uses curved and angular forms. The angled reinforced concrete slabs below the balconies give a deep basin outside the bedrooms and at roof level, which was filled with soil and planted with grass and climbing plants. The roof slab is also raised in a curve to allow wind scoops at the roof level, intended to provide cross- ventilation to the bedrooms below (Fig. 11). The engagement with African form extended beyond the roof shapes to include a series of interventions by Nigerian craftsmen and artists. Signage for the house was worked in plaster by the site foreman, Aluwo Falusi, in a Lagos vernacular which Vaughan-Richards felt had its origins in the 'Brazilian' architecture of the town.41 A group of sculpted figures worked in concrete by Festus Idehen was placed adjacent to the entrance, and the front door had a pattern in copper nails by Bruce Onibrakpaya, who also executed brick paving stones. A wrought iron screen on the staircase was made by Ayo Bello. Other elements, including lights and leather door coverings were sourced from local craft co-operatives. Another theme that was latent in the Olaoluwakitan cottage is the use of generous public spaces and courtyards between private rooms. Arguably, it is within this provision of space outside the rigid domains of the private realm that Vaughan- Richards was most successful in meeting the contemporary needs of his West African clients. The courtyards and broad corridors of Jaja Hall, for instance, a student hostel planned before the coups of 1966 but only built after the war in 1971, have made the building highly adaptable to the changes to colonial orders within education in Nigeria. The design of Jaja Hall was initially undertaken by Vaughan-Richards as a sole practitioner, but the civil war prevented its construction until the early 1970os, once he had formed a partnership with Roye Ibru. In the hiatus the budget was also reduced, and the building departs from the pre-war designs published in the West African Architect and Builder.42 The long gestation of the design project allowed an unusual amount of research to take place in the process. A model of the room was sent to England for testing in a wind tunnel to study the airflow through the rooms, and an anthropomorphic study undertaken to assist with the design of furniture (Fig. 12). While this attention to the design process could explain in some way the success of the project, it is the interplay between the building's modernist frame and its social content which makes it a remarkably robust environment today. The building's design is underscored by modernist principles. The design of the room section was standardized, to allow an economy of scale to operate in the construction and furnishing stages. The climatic approach draws on the principles of tropical architecture, using the section of the room to increase the airflow through the space and allow its residents to feel cool. Many of the details are very austere, using industrial finishes such as steel pipes or screed finishes. At the same time, there are elements of the building which fall outside the language of modernism. The central space of the building was covered over to create a dining and meeting area (Fig. 13). The form of the pitched roof, with its hips decorated with 377</page><page sequence="18">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 Fig. 11.

Alan Vaughan-Richards, Jaja Hall, University of Lagos, 1970; view of Hall in 2002 (Hannah le Roux) concrete figures, could allude to the pre-modem big houses within the Brazilian parts of Lagos or to thatched meeting rooms in village architecture. This area is crossed by pathways through the building, and faces the entrance area. It is sunken, so that the edge forms a seat looking into the central space. The line of this level change breaks with the building's perimeter at certain points to form semicircular meeting spaces between the main hall and the outdoors. The generosity with which public, shared spaces are allocated in a building with a small budget is remarkable. The passageways are doubled in width at first floor level to become balconies overlooking the courtyard, wide enough to become meaningful spaces in which to meet as well as to move through. The staircases are deep and wide, and benches along the outer balconies similarly give space for pause. In modernist design, corridors and stairs are seen as a realm for circulation, stressing the function of movement. Typically, prescribed minima are used for the various widths of stairwells and corridors according to the building's function and population. At Jaja Hall, however, Vaughan-Richards allocated space in excess of such dimensions in anticipation of its unprescribed social functions. The construction of a public domain through this promotion of shared space over, say visual devices, suggests a strong empathy with the users of the building. At the same time the bland, minimal expression of the internal envelope of the internal spaces gives a strong presence to the lived dynamics of the building. 379</page><page sequence="20">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 To what extent can this building be read as an expression of post-colonial aesthetics? It is hard to find any motif which could mark it as a visual alternative to its modernist predecessors, with the exceptions of the decorative panels besides the entrance and along the roof lines. Technologically it is far closer to the work of Cubitt and of Fry and Drew than earlier work by Vaughan-Richards. The accommodation is typical of the residences at other universities, such as Ibadan and Kumasi, planned in the 1950S. But within this language, the architect has loosened the constraints of modernism enough to support the reappropriation of the building through everyday use in ways that build alternative modes of use into its functioning. Visited in 2002, the building seemed to work well while many parts of the University and of Lagos itself seem to struggle to cope with the legacy of modernist planning. The bottom-up organizational principles which have taken over in the absence of functioning bureaucratic systems have space to work in Jaja Hall. For instance, the stairwells now house several small businesses, including hairdressers, laundry services and photocopiers. The building is an ark, with its own caterers, entertainment systems and support services all finding space between the residents' rooms. The vitality observed in the public spaces of Lagos spills over to the residence. Was this openness intentional? Certainly the design drawings show an awareness of the recreational uses of the building. The studies of the rooms show students clustered in conversational groups on beds and benches. In a talk in 1982, Vaughan-Richards spoke of how, given the dire situation with accommodation, only the students knew how many people slept in their rooms. This candour, and the humour with which it was raised, was remarkable within accounts of modern architecture in West Africa. Other architects have expressed outrage or sadness at the state of the buildings they designed, following years of little or no maintenance by bankrupt public institutions. Vaughan-Richards also engaged with his context through the media. Although the professional media was limited to a single journal, The West African Builder and Architect, he published several articles in it, which interspersed didactic essays on computers, climatic control, traditional building and Lagos architecture with descriptions of his own work. He wrote of the need for more publication from the continent: 'If Africa is to make an impact it must take advantage of world interest and produce a flood of information on its architecture.'43 The publication of information on buildings should be linked with preservation agendas. He undertook to document 'Brazilian' architecture in Lagos through sketches which were used in the book Building Lagos which he co- authored with Prince Kunle Akinsomoyin.44 The book is a historical document of the development of the city which intersperses images of city life, nature and transport with an accurate historical record of the built culture of Lagos. A third aspect of Vaughan-Richards' engagement with Nigerian architecture was his collegiality with Nigerian professionals including Olumuyiwa. He joined the Nigerian Institute of Architects. Although he enjoyed working as a sole practitioner, his partnership with Roye Ibru after 1970 was a strategic decision forced in part by the indigenization policies of the government. Ironically, the work from this partnership lacks the sense of engagement with context which is evident in the projects of the 196os. Vaughan-Richards' links to Nigeria were to a large part emotional ones, tied to his family life and love for the natural and historical context of Lagos. His disaffection with 380</page><page sequence="21">GHANA AND NIGERIA the city, which was no longer 'a lovely place', was evident by the 198os when he presented his work at an exhibition at the University of Lagos. By then his most important work was also altered by the infilling of the lagoon which literally marooned the buildings, including his own home, which he had designed in George James Street, and the move of Lagos's university functions to a central campus. Other than Jaja Hall, then, Vaughan-Richard's work is not so much a significant material legacy as it is a trace of his personal search for meaning as an expatriate architect in an independent African country. ULLI BEIER Ulli Beier came to Nigeria in 1950 as tutor for the department of English at the University of Ibadan, moving after a year to teach Extra-Mural studies.45 Like Vaughan- Richards, and indeed most of the teaching staff at tertiary institutions, he was an expatriate although not comfortably part of the British colonial community. His engagement with the arts until his departure in 1966 took place in a number of venues and through different media. He supported several artists who were becoming established, but in addition to this he was involved in the establishment of the Mbari Artists and Writers Club, which promoted the work of writers such as Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and Christopher Okigbo, and artists including Demas Nwoko. The journal, Black Orpheus, which he founded and edited, was an important medium in the development of creative and critical writing amongst black writers within and beyond Nigeria. Beier's own writing, which was prolific, documented traditional and modern arts and writing. Beier's contact with the architectural community was less direct but, as a writer, Beier produced critical comment on colonial modern architecture. In addition some of the artists in contact with Beier, Demas Nwoko, Bruce Onobrakpeya, Ashire Olatunde and Susan Wenger, were commissioned by expatriate architects to execute in-situ artwork. It is also likely that the success of Beier's workshops, exhibitions and writing in bringing attention to contemporary art in Nigeria raised the awareness of public art by architects. If Beier did not directly engage with the architectural community, the period he spent as an academic at the University of Ibadan brought him into direct contact with the work of Fry, Drew and Partners. The campus was being rebuilt to their designs and was the subject of Beier's critique in a short chapter in Art in Nigeria, a survey of current work which was published on the eve of independence as a catalogue for the Independence Exhibition.46 In opening, the article acknowledges the inevitability of modern architecture within Nigeria, where 'nearly all public buildings of importance are being built by European architects, and in a style and technique foreign to the country'. Apart from the technical difficulties of adapting 'Brazilian' architecture for banks or universities, Beier suggests that most Nigerians see modern architecture as a symbol of progress and participation in a modern world. Beier noted that this 'readiness on the part of the Nigerian to accept anything big and modern and technically impressive' gave the foreign architect in Nigeria a moral 381</page><page sequence="22">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 responsibility, in that his influence on the users would be profoundly and unconsciously influential. However, Beier argued against the idea that it would be right to use architecture to convert Nigerians to foreign values. He disputes Fry's claim that there was nothing to be learned from traditional African architecture. Looking carefully at Fry's claim that his buildings were not an imposition because of their adaptation to local climate, Beier comparatively describes the buildings at Ibadan and the traditional architecture of southern Nigeria. In this he finds that the modern architecture performs less satisfactorily. Although the 'mud mosques of Ilorin, for example', like the University buildings feature breathing walls, the scale of openings in modern buildings admit a 'tiring' white glaring light. The traditional houses, built around compounds, and even old colonial buildings addressed this problem but 'the modern architects are much more ready to ignore the lessons that can be learnt from local builders'. Beier then acknowledges that the library building, which set a screen wall off from the interior to control the climate, had solved the problem of glare. Nonetheless this building raises other concerns which are not 'purely practical'. Despite Fry's contention that the architect had an ability to draw from a foreign place's genius and its people's culture, the building, like most other modern buildings, had failed in this respect. Beier contrasts the 'soft undulating lines of a Nigerian town' with the 'modern buildings: hard, angular, glaring white, unapproachable'. The building's design lack 'the basic principle of African life: rhythm'. In the article's conclusion, Beier envisages the effect of decolonization on the composition of the architecture profession, with Nigerian architects replacing foreign architects. He wonders whether they will be able to produce a 'truly Nigerian style of modern architecture'. His final paragraph suggests that these architects could learn from other areas of activity, and quotes Senghor's poetry as an inspirational theme. Modern architecture is the symbol of the rigidity of mechanized, materialistic Western culture. Perhaps architects should heed even more than other people the advice of Senghor in his poem to New York: ... let black blood flow into your blood, That it may rub the rust from your steel joints, Like an oil of life, That it may give to your bridges the bend of buttocks and the suppleness of creepers. Along with the powerful use of poetry, Beier drew on photography to put across his critical points. The article juxtaposes abstracted images of the facades at the University College, Ibadan, with those of traditional Yoruba mud architecture, which uses thick, patterned broken walls (Fig. 14). Beier's ease of expression in both academic and creative writing and his ability to draw on visual sources made his critique a powerful one beyond the discipline that he was criticizing. But in addition to this role as a critic Beier engaged, as a mentor, in developing young artists through the medium of workshops. One of his proteges, Demas Nwoko (1935- ), who worked on murals, went on to achieve recognition as a designer, initially of stage sets and in the 1970s of more permanent structures. Nwoko's 382</page><page sequence="23">GHANA AND NIGERIA -, 7,, 9" '~".t; .... ,I. -. ~ :"' ',-':',,:f ,i:.~ ' "* .;4-- i ' . .. 'R..f. ...t . .;,. *E.^ 'A t. . *. . . h.' J f.t 4 tt W 4.

Comparative images of 'traditional Yoruba mud architecture' and Fry, Drew and Partners, University College, Ibadan, 1951 (Ulli Beier, Art in Nigeria 196o (Cambridge, 1960), p. 55) buildings include his own house and the Dominican community (Fig. 15) near Ibadan, which are both climatically shaped, using passive thermal control and breathing walls for cooling, and formally expressive. For Beier, Mwoko's work represents an interesting alternative to the 'boring' modernism of the expatriate architects.47 Beier was also an admirer of Amancio d'Alpoim 'Pancho' Guedes, the Mozambique- based architect. He described Guedes, who approached his buildings sculpturally, as 'the most adventurous architect in Africa'.4 But Guedes, in his patronage of young artists such as Valente Malangatana, also served as a model for the engaged role in 383</page><page sequence="24">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 Fig. 15. Demas Nwoko, Dominican Monastery, Ibadan (Hannah le Roux) relation to local artists that Beier adopted. Guedes had also been involved, with his South African colleague, Julian Beinart, in a number of summer schools for artists and art teachers, and Beier invited them to Ibadan to conduct a workshop there in 1961. Amongst the legacies of the workshop is a mural by Guedes in the foyer of a residence, now Sultana Bello Hall, which had been designed by Fry and Drew. Beier held strong views on the sort of art that was included in modern architecture. Yusuf Grillo, who had trained under a British teacher, Frith, executed mosaiced murals for both Fry and Drew and for Godwin and Hopwood's buildings. Beier found this work, which showed street scenes, uninteresting and 'kitsch'.49 His patronage supported artists whose work was more expressive. The mural by Susanne Wenger on the Bristol Hotel faqade, commissioned by the Architects' Co-Partnership when Alan Vaughan-Richards was project architect, is a more innovative work. The mosaiced work, which shows abstracted, dancing figures, draws influence from traditional West African block printing. 384</page><page sequence="25">GHANA AND NIGERIA As a writer, Beier was the most articulate critic of tropical architecture within Nigeria but, as an outsider to the discipline of architecture and to the British expatriate community, his influence on the profession was limited. Nonetheless his position, inspired as it was by francophone concepts of negritude, is of interest. He saw architecture as a cultural product and, moreover, one which produced tensions between Western and African thinking. THE KUMASI SCHOOL In contrast to the extra-curricular location of the cultural experiments at Ibadan, the Faculty of Architecture at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi in the i96os was set up as a vocational training in architecture. The Faculty had been established in 1957 but following a highly critical accreditation visit, Otto Koenigsberger, the director of the School of Tropical Architecture at the Architectural Association, was invited to help the University set up a similar course there. Koenigsberger asked John Lloyd, a first year tutor at the Architectural Association, to head the school, which he did between 1963 and 1966. Under Lloyd the faculty structures, including its degree path and curriculum, and the staff of the school were extensively changed.50 The school was housed in a modernist building, designed by Charles Hobbis, as part of the campus, an icon of tropical architecture designed by James Cubitt and Kenneth Scott in the early 1950S. The building itself was changed, in part to add accommodation and also to adapt to local conditions. The three years during which the faculty ran under Lloyd's leadership culminated at the time of the coup which saw Nkrumah deposed, and the replacement of his civilian government with a military regime. At Kumasi, the university Vice-Chancellor was dismissed by the military. Lloyd subsequently departed from the school, where the professor of technology took over as dean of the faculty. While the school at Kumasi has continued in existence, offering the only degree path to the architecture profession in Ghana, the brief period of Lloyd's tenure in the i96os was one during which the school was exceptionally visible, both within Ghana and internationally. The strategies of working on real projects, and of recording and disseminating publications of the various consultancies and workshops conducted within the school, has left a fascinating record of the transformation of its pedagogy. Lloyd had no background in Africa when he arrived, and spent two months preparing for the reorganization of the faculty. Part of his preparation was a reading list that Koenigsberger had given him which included texts by Nkrumah and Julius Nyerere, the president of Tanzania. Nkrumah's pre-independence writing and speeches had been published in I speak of Freedom: A Statement of African Ideology in 1961, and included a direct reference to the work of the university, then a college, in a speech made on the eve of independence. After commending the work of the Building Institute in research on passive cooling, he said: 'I believe that one of the most important services which Ghana can perform for Africa is to devise a system of education based at its University level on concrete studies of the problems of the tropical world.'51 Nkrumah also spoke of the necessity of coordinating government activity to deal with the interlinked issues involved in improving the standard of life in a tropical country. 385</page><page sequence="26">ARCHIITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 Many aspects of the school's activities resonate with Nkrumah's thinking. Lloyd has described how, when trying to conceive how to make the form of the faculty 'relevant to Africa', a decisive event happened. [There] was a surprise visit one evening by two men. They were the Director of Social Welfare and Community Development of the Upper Region and the Chief of a small tribe at Nangodi in the extreme north of Ghana. They needed help desperately as the tribe was dying from river blindness and malaria. Whilst I hesitated as an architect to take on a difficult health problem I was apparently their last hope, and agreed we would try. When the students reassembled they were transported to the north and confronted with the problem of the village (bar one they were all southerners who had never been north). The culture and language were all totally foreign although part of their country. They had to survey everything and try to understand the village's very serious problems. If at the end of the year we had a reasonable solution and fewer people were dying then I would feel confident to recommend to the University that we had a viable Faculty. The students were faced with the design of everything. This experience transformed the Faculty. This type of village study and design became the content of the third year's syllabus.52 The faculty became involved in the single largest planning exercise undertaken in Ghana at the time, the Volta Resettlement project. The generation of hydro-electricity through the damming of the Volta River was leading to the displacement of 80,000 villagers. Researchers at the school were responsible for the census and for negotiating with people as to where they would move, resulting in a large-scale voluntary resettlement. In addition, the school planned and designed the southern and south- western sectors and the house types, and followed up the resettlement with studies and a conference. Lloyd has written that 'we tried to document all we did and sent copies to all the professionals in government and in private practice'.53 The reports, usually A4, often contained strong graphic content and covers (Fig. 16). A similar attention to visual codes is evident in the choice of an Ashanti symbol as the faculty symbol (Fig. 17). The faculty hosted visits by a number of international guests, including Richard Buckminster Fuller, the American designer, Sylvia Crowe, a landscape designer, Eustaquio Toledo, a Brazilian architect expert in climatic design, Dr Dmochowski, who was involved in his epic record of Nigerian vernacular architecture,54 and Paul Oliver, who was to publish a comparative survey of shelters in non-Western places.55 As part of the Buckminster Fuller visit, a 15 metre diameter dome was designed in Ghanain aluminium as a prototype for emergency clinics for the Sahel, and built as part of a national exhibition. The staff of the faculty came from a variety of backgrounds, and included an early Ghanain graduate, John Owusu-Addo, who had attended the course in Tropical Architecture at the Architectural Association. Pat Wakely was another AA graduate who along with a student, Babar Mumtaz, went on to teach at (and now heads) the Development Planning Unit (DPU) of University College, London. Kamil Mumtaz, one of the lecturers, left the school to head the architecture school in Lahore in Pakistan. Another lecturer, Max Bond, was a Harvard-trained African-American architect who subsequently practiced in the United States. After graduation and work experience in Paris, Bond had come to Ghana as a volunteer to work for the Ghana National 386</page><page sequence="27">GHANA AND NIGERIA Fig. 17. Faculty symbol, Kumasi.

The course, in its emphasis on interdisciplinary work, was certainly a model for development studies programmes such as those later run at the DPU. One change which Lloyd recalls as causing debate was the restructuring of the course in architectural history in line with an Africanist approach. [the existing course] is practically without exception European architecture. It seemed exotic and irrelevant in Africa. We created a new program called 'a visual survey of Africa', we tried to cover architecture, all the arts and textiles from the Sahel to Ethiopia and down to Natal. Initially some staff were reluctant and the students embarrassed, but fairly quickly it took off and we soon had participants from other universities and practising artists. I think we were amazed ourselves by the wealth and diversity.57 Of the design work produced by the staff, the Bolgatanga library (Fig. 18) designed by Max Bond was the building that most strongly drew from African forms.58 The plan forms drew on indigenous architecture, such as those documented in Lobi dwellings in northern Ghana by his teaching colleague, Lutz Christians,59 although the earth walls and timbers posts were constructed in brickwork and concrete. The plan, like local vernaculars, used 'little rooms' in a cluster as accommodation, with an oversailing, double-skinned roof. The programme of the library was an innovative one which reflected Nkrumah's commitment to spreading literacy. An auditorium for literacy sessions, and parking for four mobile libraries were included.60 While the Bolgatanga library was seen as a model for future projects, the changing politics of the country meant these did not happen. Bond left Ghana in 1968, having witnessed the radical changes which followed Nkrumah's departure. The university became 'more conservative', and the architects, having been seen as somewhat outrageous, no longer had the support of its new leadership.61 The three years during which the school was run by Lloyd showed many possibilities for engagement with the development of the independent nation through technology, planning, and housing as much as through the design of buildings. While the course was receptive to contemporary technology, the material culture of West Africa was also taken seriously as a source of knowledge appropriate to contemporary building. Despite the successes of the course, the forms of practice for which it prepared students were dependent on a political framework which was already in crisis, and that collapsed with Nkrumah's deposition. Without capital funding in infrastructure and a centralized planning framework, the application of ideas from Kumasi was seriously curtailed. CONCLUSION In contrast to the pre-independence era in British West Africa, where tropical architecture was the orthodoxy, the first decade of the post-colonial period produced a diversity of expressive forms and practices. In part, the very different political 389</page><page sequence="30">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 47: 2004 directions taken by the leadership of two nations explain the different scope of work in each country: in Nigeria, lacking resources from a centralized economy, architects and critics worked within the constraints of their own practices while Ghana, as a socialist state, supported broad planning and educational reform, enabling a strong programmatic approach to small scale works. Yet even within a single town, Lagos, the directions taken by two architects, one expatriate and the other local, with respect to formal expression, show quite different attitudes. While in the 1950s much of the documentation of tropical architecture took place in British-based journals, in the post-colonial period it is harder to find reportage on the work in Ghana and Nigeria.62 This creates a deceptive perspective. Far from being quiet, the i960s were a period of extraordinary experimentation in West Africa. The establishment of educational institutions, professional bodies, a journal, and public exhibitions allowed for the development of a discursive content in the local architecture professions. Although many British professionals left the former colonies, some of the remaining (and newly arrived) expatriates began to reconsider their discipline critically. In doing so, architecture at least paralleled, if not explicitly drew from, the vital body of Africanist thinking of its time. The material production of this period is also in contrast to the earlier decade. The 1960s produced no monumental equivalents to the Universities of Ibadan or Kumasi, or the school programmes of Ghana and Nigeria in the 1950S. Rather, a series of minor works, including significant amounts of housing in Ghana and buildings for private clients in Nigeria, were built. Despite their scale, however, these works remain significant as the traces of the very different directions in architecture pursued as a creative response to the deep transformations of its contexts after uhuru.63 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The research for this paper was supported in part by a grant towards field research in Nigeria in August 2002 awarded by the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain.

The exhibition, The AA in Africa, held at the Architectural Association, London, 16 January to 14 February 2003, brought together material from the personal archives of John Godwin and Gillian Hopwood; Fry, Drew and Creamer; John Baker; Zbyzeck Plocki; Renate Koenigsberger; Patrick Wakely; John Owusu-Addo; and Remi Vaughan-Richards. In sourcing material it became evident how little documented the post-colonial period has been, in contrast to the 1950S when the modern architecture in the British colonies of West Africa was relatively well covered by the Western media. The existing history and theory on modem architecture in Africa, such as the recent books by Fuller, Wright and Cohen, also tends to focus on the late-colonial period. The existing material in print that does cover the post-colonial period, such as the catalogue for the Short Century exhibition (ed. Elleh, Hughes and Kultermann) is generally a survey rather than in-depth discussion of particular work. An outstanding reference has been The West African Builder and Architect which, as the only journal covering the area during the i96os, offers a thorough documentation of several important projects. 63 Freedom.</page></plain_text>
