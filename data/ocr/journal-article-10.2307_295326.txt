<plain_text><page sequence="1">EURIPIDES' JUDGMENT: LITERARY CREATION IN ANDROMACHE Aristotle gives the following advice to future playwrights about the use of traditional stories: So one should not seek to cling at all costs to the traditional stories, around which our tragedies are constructed. And in fact it is absurd to seek this, since even the familiar stories are familiar to few, but delight all alike. Thus it is clear from these considerations that the poet should be a maker of plots rather than verses, by as much as he is a poet by virtue of his imitation, and he imitates actions. (Poet. 1451b23-29) As Aristotle indicates, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides did not share his view of the use of traditional stories. His advice, however, cautions us against easily accepting their plots as simple variations of traditional stories or assuming that the authors were constrained by the audience's preconceived expectations of plot or belief in a "historical truth."' The tragedians were, in fact, makers of plot and should be studied as such. To be sure, we must recognize that it is always difficult to comprehend an author's creative method-all the more so when we know little about the author, have only a small proportion of his work or others' work from the period, and have, in fact, large gaps in our knowl- edge both of the traditional stories used in the genre and of the period itself. Furthermore, we must deal with the difficulties imposed by sto- ries that embody the complex relationship of inyth and history and that have passed not only from an oral into a literate tradition but into the highly sophisticated and formalized genre of tragedy. Euripides in particular piques our curiosity with his plots, some of which-as in the case in Andromache-careen off in the most unlikely directions. As Goldhill notes, Euripides is the tragedian most often associated with the force of innovation, yet his attitude toward the received versions of myth is not one of rejection, for he repeatedly uses 'On the complicated intellectual relationship of myth and history Veyne argues (Did the Greeks Believe? 21), "Let us take as our starting point the fact that all legends- the Trojan War, the Thebaid, or the expedition of the Argonauts-passed for being com- pletely authentic." As he points out, "A world cannot be inherently fictional; it can be fictional only according to whether one believes in it or not."

How does a poet invent when he works within a genre that privileges the traditional? How does he make his own story when he is simply filling the lacunae within existing narratives?6 In the plays of Euripides about the Trojan War and its aftermath- 2Goldhill, Reading Greek Tragedy 161, 166. With regard to Aristotle's remark that in Agathon's Antheus both the events and the names are fictitious, Else observes (Aris- totle's Poetics 319): "This clearly implies, by the order in which events and names are mentioned ('both the events and the names'), Aristotle's awareness of a fundamental fact: that in Greek tragedy the action was likely to be partly or wholly fictitious even if the names were 'known."' On the importance of myth in Euripides, however, see Kamerbeck ("Mythe et r6alite"), who concludes (25) that "la substance spirituelle de son oeuvre est nourrie par cette tension entre les deux puissances qui ont r6gn6 sur son esprit: le mythe et la realite." McDermott ("Double Meaning and Mythic Novelty") examines methods Euripides used to indicate deviations from tradition. 3Poet. 1451b15-16. Veyne (Did the Greeks Believe? 45) explicates Aristotle's com- ment that only a few know the traditional stories: "The essence of a myth is not that everyone knows it but that it is supposed to be known and is worthy of being known by all." 4Poet. 1451b7-8. 5 See Conacher, Euripidean Drama 5, on the advantages of using well-known and catastrophic events in the lives of ancient heroes rather than the particular and contingent events of everyday life. 6 Else (Aristotle's Poetics 320) describes the complex relationship of the traditional and the invented: "The poet is not a poet in so far as he merely clothes a traditional story in new verses. He is required to make something for himself, namely that structure of events in which universal may come to expression; and it is evident from Aristotle's earnestness and emphasis that he regards this as the paramount duty of the poet. But on the other hand 'creation' is too pretentious and implies too much. Aristotle is a Greek, for whom creation means discovery [heuresis], the uncovering of a true relation which al- ready exists somehow in the scheme of things. The poet is not a creator in the irresponsi- ble sense that the whole construct is made out of his own unregulated sensibility." 372</page><page sequence="3">LITERARY CREATION IN ANDROMACHE Andromache, Hecuba, Trojan Women, Helen, Iphigenia at Aulis, Alexan- dros-we have an opportunity to examine the playwright at work within a tradition of great antiquity and established diffusion. In these plays Euripides refers to the Judgment of Paris, an event which is outside the temporal space of the individual dramas but was fully treated in the Cypria, may well be assumed in the Homeric epics, and was repre- sented frequently in art.7 His inclusion of the story is all the more notable because, as Stinton points out in his analysis of the Judgment in the plays, in each occurrence it is tied firmly to the larger story of the Trojan War: the choice of Paris meant the abduction of Helen, which brought down Troy and involved all Greece in its ruin.8 Thus by his use of the Judgment story he asserts a narrative within which the individual moments in the plays are embedded. The story of the Judgment in itself is very complex.9 It is a mo- ment when gods and man come into contact, when men judge gods. It provides insight into the jealous nature of the anthropomorphic god- desses that leads to the beauty contest. It provides a divine causation for the war. It sheds light on human as well as divine nature; Paris chooses Aphrodite's offer of a beautiful woman over Hera's of kingship and power and Athena's of military prowess and glory. The sybarite sacrifices achievement in the heroic world of power and glory. The satis- faction of desire leads to the Greek expedition, and the erotic impulse intrudes into the public domain through the ensuing war, binding to- 7The first reference to the Judgment may be Iliad 24.29-30, "(Paris) who insulted the goddesses, when they arrived in his courtyard, but praised her who gave to him grievous lust." From the outline in Proclus Chrestomathy 1, other testimonia, and the few fragments it is clear that the story was fully told in the Cypria (Kinkel, Epicorum Graeco- rum Fragmenta I 17; Allen, Homeri Opera V 116-25). In art, the Judgment scene is depicted on a seventh-century ivory comb from Sparta (Artemis Orthia 223, pl. 127), and on the seventh-century "Chigi vase" (Macmillan Painter Proto-Corinthian Chigi Vase, Rome, Villa Giulia). On the Cypria, its relationship to the Homeric texts, and the diffu- sion of the story see Huxley, Greek Epic Poetry 123-43, esp. 128, 132. For a comprehen- sive study of the character, history, and sources of the story before and in Euripides see Stinton, Euripides and the Judgement, esp. 2-4 on the relationship to Homer and the appearance in art. 8Stinton, Euripides and the Judgement 63: "That he should have handled the theme in the way he does may simply be the effect of the tradition he inherited; but his insistence on it is remarkable, and suggests that he did not regard it merely as a starting point for his narrative." 9On the complexities of the story, which are due in part to its particular amalgam of saga and folktale, see Stinton, Euripides and the Judgement 2-5, 59-60. 373</page><page sequence="4">CHRISTINA ELLIOTT SORUM gether inextricably the personal and political.10 Thus when Menelaus sets sail to repossess his property and to reconstruct his marriage and his oikos, as well as to avenge the violation of the "xenos-bond," his act manifests both the social significance of women and the importance of the reciprocal obligations that order the relationships of men and cities. At a psychological level we find in the story of the Judgment the misog- ynistic message that sexual women-Aphrodite, Helen-are the source of toil and suffering for men, a message not dissimilar to that in He- siod's Prometheus-Pandora story or in the Hebrew Bible account of Adam and Eve. All of this can be read in an account of the Judgment of Paris. The more "literary" uses of the story of the Judgment are equally intricate; they, of course, depend upon a reading in context. The de- scription of the simple and isolated shepherd who is visited in his idyl- lic grove on Ida by the three powerful goddesses who are indulging their vanity in a beauty contest provides the opportunity to develop both ironic and tragic contrast to the horrors of the war that ensue. For example, in Trojan Women Euripides juxtaposes Andromache's wrenching farewell to her baby son (who is about to die) to Helen and Hecuba's bitterly sophisticated debate over who is to blame for the war (740-79, 914-1031). More directly, in Hecuba the chorus describes the sorrow of mothers mourning their sons as the result of the Judgment (629-55). Upon occasion Euripides uses the story of the Judgment to signify the inexorable sequence of events that comprise the cycle itself: the abduction of Helen, the sacrifice of Iphigenia, the expedition to Troy, the death of Achilles, the fall of Troy, and the returns which follow one after the other as a consequence of Paris' choice. This regulatory ef- fect-that of a "literary fate"-is used with dramatic significance in Iphigenia at Aulis, where the tension between the dramatic moment and the traditional story energizes the plot even as the latter precludes the potential of the former." In other words, the reference to this event within the unique plot opens a window upon a sequence of events exter- nal to the drama that in turn acts back upon the individual scenes. Not all moments in the extended story were accounted for, nor '?See Iphigenia at Aulis 573-85 for this emphasis within a play itself Alford (Psychoanalytic Theory 56) provides a useful discussion of the failure of attempts to separate the oikos from the polis, which he regards as a primary subject of tragedy. "Sorum, "Myth, Choice, and Meaning." 374</page><page sequence="5">LITERARY CREATION IN ANDROMACHE had all been elaborated in the Homeric and cyclic epics, in other poetry, and in art. Individual events existed in an abstract and iconic form: the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, the Judgment on Ida, individual epi- sodes in the expedition and in the siege and fall of Troy. Each individual representation implied to the viewer or listener the existence of a narra- tive of events preceding and following the scene, but the links-days, weeks, years-in the story were not accounted for in the Iliad, the Cypria, or elsewhere, and only the human assumption of diachronic sequence and universal laws of causation created coherence. Because of the expectations of the human imagination, a story is always implicit between two events, an untold story that is outlined by the demands of reason and-equally importantly when dealing with elements from tra- ditional stories, from myths-by the expectation of a certain consis- tency in the narrative development of decisive moments and of charac- ters. 12 Andromache offers one example of a "new" story that fills a la- cuna, an example of Euripides' "making a plot" as Aristotle claims a good playwright will. 13 Here, then, we can attempt to examine methods 12 On the limitations of the freedom of the author to contrive in both narrative and lyric see Gernet, Anthropologie de la Grece antique 120-21; Vernant, Myth and Society 224. In his interpretation of Gernet, Vernant says: "A story told by the mythographers is always, to some degree, a reconstruction but the way it is fitted together does not depend entirely on the discretion of the narrator or on the literary sources: it reflects a tradition even in the connections that the mythographer may himself have invented." 13My text is Euripides: Fabulae I, ed. J. Diggle (Oxford 1984). Stevens (Euripides: Andromache 1-5) offers a concise account of what is known about the story prior to Euripides' play. Pindar in Paean 6 and Nemean 7 indicates that Neoptolemus was killed at Delphi. In the epinikion Neoptolemus rules briefly in Molossia, where his descendants are destined to rule forever. Stevens concludes that there is no evidence extant of any association of Peleus and Orestes with the Neoptolemus-Hermione story and that spec- ulations about what Sophocles' Hermione may have contributed to Euripides' play are in vain. He also attributes to Euripidean invention the sequence of events concerning the arguments of Andromache and Hermione and the subsequent plot of the Spartan to kill Andromache and her child, as well as the responsibility of Orestes for the death of Neoptolemus and the second visit of Neoptolemus to Delphi in order to atone for his blasphemy of Apollo. Stevens notes that all is contrived in order to bring maximum discredit upon Hermione, Menelaus, and Orestes. For additional discussion of the ante- cedents see also Conacher (Euripidean Drama 166-70), who argues that Euripides joins the Neoptolemus and Andromache alliance to the Neoptolemus-Orestes-Hermione story and invents, as far as we can tell, the Hermione-Andromache conflict. Like Ste- vens, Conacher concludes that all is contrived to vilify the Spartans Menelaus and Her- mione and the latter's cousin-suitor, Orestes (169). 375</page><page sequence="6">CHRISTINA ELLIOTT SORUM of plot invention within a genre that is permeated by traditional stories. We can examine how the author creates and elaborates within the scheme, how he manipulates or is manipulated by the tradition as he has received it, how he fills in the gaps within the story. Furthermore, we can examine the way in which he utilizes the correspondence be- tween his own and earlier versions of the tale to make the former more plausible and significant and to revalue the latter. The starting point in this story is the Judgment of Paris. 14 Treated as the initial event within the play, it becomes a reference for subse- quent events as four elements of the story become paradigms for the author's "inventions." These narrative elements are, first, the beauty contest of the three goddesses; second, Paris' choice among the bribes of the goddesses (the "allegorical choice" as Stinton names it); third, the murder-or proposed murder-of a child, either Iphigenia, whose story is included in the Cypria, or the baby Paris; and fourth, the con- flict over the possession of a woman, Helen.15 The various mutations of these elements within the play demonstrate a method by which new stories are generated out of old, the way in which the mythological story is extended, and the way in which a playwright imbued with tradi- tional stories fashions new plots.16 In other words, working with these existing patterns, Euripides creates new stories that then appear as "discoveries" or preexisting but unexpressed moments of the tradition rather than as inventions. Andromache begins with an immediate evocation of the past. The heroine recalls the wealth of Troy, her glory, her status as Hector's wife and the mother of his child (1-4), Achilles' slaughter of Hector, and the '4See Stinton, Euripides and the Judgement 14, on the poet's freedom to set the parameters of the story. '5These narrative elements can be identified as types of Proppian functions; how- ever, for our purposes here this identification is not useful. Rather, I focus on the author's manipulation of story patterns to create a plot for a highly sophisticated literary genre. On "functions" or motifemes see Propp, Morphology of the Folktale chs. 2-3. '6Aristotle (Poet. 1449b36-50al5) distinguishes between the plot (muthos)-which is the imitation of an action, a structuring of events-and the character and thought (ethos and dianoia) of the people who necessarily carry out the plot. The four elements that I distinguish as having a dynamic function in the creation of a new story do not correspond directly to Aristotelian categories, for each exhibits aspects of plot, character, and thought. On the difficulty of isolating plot for separate consideration see Nehamas, "My- thology: The Theory of Plot." 376</page><page sequence="7">LITERARY CREATION IN ANDROMACHE Greeks' murder of her son Astyanax (8-11).17 Andromache's past is familiar, but her present situation is new. She is in a foreign place, remote Phthia; she is a member of a new social stratum, a slave; and she has a new son by a new "husband," Neoptolemus. Yet the more detail she supplies about her new situation, the more clearly she recreates her past. Although now she is clinging to the shrine of Thetis in Phthia rather than trembling within the walls of Troy, once again she is be- sieged by the Greeks, in fact by members of the house of Atreus. Al- though now she is in a Greek household, once again a Greek woman is the source of her troubles, not Helen but Helen's daughter. Although Andromache's son now has a Greek father, her child is once again a target of Greek hatred. Although now Andromache is herself a slave, her fellow Trojan slave defers to her as though she were still the lady of the house (56). 18 Furthermore, the myth that began with the wedding of Thetis to the king of Phthia and led to the destruction of Andromache's world in Troy has returned to its point of origin; a marriage in Phthia is the source of the current trouble. As the familiar patterns emerge in the new tale, they assert its authenticity; simultaneously, as the past and present become one, both can be rewritten. The source of conflict in the current situation is-as it was before, in the Judgment-a contest among (here, between) women, and a choice by a man. 19 Not only do references to the Judgment precede and follow the debate between Andromache and Hermione, but the con- frontation-which both Conacher and Stevens accept as a Euripidean innovation-itself recalls the Judgment.20 The jealousy that is exem- plified by the contest of the goddesses and that, within the play, is repeatedly identified with the female nature is demonstrated here as Andromache and Hermione argue over Neoptolemus.21 The three god- 7 See Stevens, Euripides: Andromache 13, on the constant references to the past not only by Andromache but also by Peleus and Menelaus. He suggests that because of these references the war might be considered as the real theme of the play. I agree that the Trojan War is more than a background but would argue that this linking of present and past is formative rather in its shaping of the following episodes and its ensuring their reality by associating the new with the old.

The two women here also present alternatives to the man: an alliance with the politically well-connected, rich, and beautiful but childless young wife, or with the old, powerless, childbearing slave woman. The irony in this situation lies not only in the young man's preference for the unwilling old slave rather than for the beautiful young and willing wife, and in Andromache's rejection of her master's attentions (37), but also in the arguments of the two women themselves.22 Hermione's charges against Andromache are stereotypical accu- sations against barbarians who are incestuous, murderous within their families, licentious, and versed in evil potions (147-80).23 But they also recall the crimes of the house of Atreus, especially of Hermione's aunt Clytemnestra and her mother, Helen. Andromache cleverly returns the attack; she makes explicit Hermione's fondness for luxury, her habit of flaunting the status of her father before her husband, and her unseemly possessiveness, which the Trojan compares with Helen's excessive in- terest in men (183-231). She is even able to turn the barbarian custom of polygamy against Hermione by using it to condemn the Greek's exces- sive jealousy (215-20).24 She equates these moral and conjugal failings with Hermione's failure to bear children, just as she seems to indicate that her own compliance and submissiveness as a wife-a submissive- ness, she reminds Hermione, that extended to wet-nursing the off- spring of Hector's erotic adventures-are linked to her fertility (222- 24).25 This deferential and obedient figure recalls the Andromache of 22The contest of the goddesses was also fought and won with words, not by the merits of the rival claimants-as Stinton notes (Euripides and the Judgement 18-19). 23 Hall (Inventing the Barbarian 188-89) describes this as one of the most flamboy- ant passages of antibarbarism rhetoric in tragedy; notes that familial murders and incest, two particular crimes charged to barbarians, were a particular source of irony for Euripi- des because of their frequent occurrence in Greek myth (188-89, 175); and observes that Hermione's charge that Andromache has used drugs to make her barren recalls Medea (200). 24So also Conacher (Euripidean Drama 176), on Andromache's likening of Her- mione to Helen. On the attribution of polygamy to barbarians see Hall, Inventing the Barbarian 135. 25Michelini (Euripides and the Tragic Tradition 92-93) emphasizes the bizarre nature of this particular expression of wifely virtue by Andromache, which in my view increases the force of the contrasting arguments. 378</page><page sequence="9">LITERARY CREATION IN ANDROMACHE Iliad book 6. Here, through the careful conflation of her previous rela- tionship to Hector and her current enslavement to Neoptolemus, she ironically becomes the center and symbol of the legitimate household and its continuity. Moreover, she has won the contest; Neoptolemus has reversed Paris' choice by rejecting the youth, beauty, and wealth of Hermione for the good character of Andromache (205-6). True wifely virtue has become the ally of desire; as Andromache says, "Not beauty, o woman, but virtues delight husbands" (207). The chorus themselves further compel comparison of the two contests, for immediately follow- ing this debate they sing of the hateful strife of the three goddesses, which was won by Aphrodite with her deceitful words (274-92).26 The female troublemakers deplored by Andromache are not limited to the human race (273). The replay of the Judgment is the Trojan revenge on Paris' eroti- cism and on the Greeks, who are now rejected in the form of Hermione. The adjustment in the paradigm, from beauty contest into a contest between the bad but beautiful woman and the good though aging woman, allows a new formulation. Previously, erotic desire has proved deadly for Greek men-whether represented in the figure of Aphrodite, or Helen, or Cassandra. In this case the erotic inclination is linked through Neoptolemus' fathering of Andromache's child to the genera- tive family and to household virtues, a coupling that creates the poten- tial for another outcome. A third element deeply-and ominously-embedded in the Trojan cycle is the murder of children. Euripides incorporates this motif into the story of the Judgment with his reference to the death demanded for the baby Paris (293-300). The sacrifice of Iphigenia marks the begin- ning of the Trojan War, the death of Polyxena the end; the sacrifice of the maiden before the war indicates a renunciation of peacetime life and happy union, and through a reversal of beginning and end, of guilt and atonement, the sacrifice of a maiden following a battle expresses feel- ings of guilt and a readiness to atone. As Burkert has remarked, "A period of license gives vent to the extraordinary; another act of killing ends and transforms it into an order of renunciation."27 In addition, the Greeks murder Astyanax, not in order to offer sacrifice for a dead war- rior but to negate a Trojan future; the infant heir is the means of a Trojan 26 See Stinton, Euripides and the Judgement 13-23, for a detailed discussion of this stasimon. 27Burkert, Homo Necans 64, 67. 379</page><page sequence="10">CHRISTINA ELLIOTT SORUM resurrection. A variant of the story of the murdered child is the pattern of Oedipus, the child who should be but is not killed; in the legend of Troy, that child is Paris.28 The importance of children's deaths in this play is immediately signaled by Andromache herself, who in the prologue recalls watching as her son was hurled to his death from the high towers of Troy (10). In the first stasimon the chorus bridge the gap between personal and politi- cal when they sing of Aphrodite's deceitful words that hurled down the towers of Troy and then, with startling brutality, wish that Hecuba had killed the baby Paris when Cassandra had pled for his death (292-300). Euripides exploits the pattern of child murder as Hermione and Mene- laus demand the death of Andromache's second child. This child both signifies Andromache's fertility-and simultaneously Hermione's bar- ren womb-and provides a link between the house of Peleus and the family of Priam that becomes increasingly important as the playwright develops events. As with Astyanax, the baby's enemies are Greek; as with Astyanax, the desire to murder the child is a desire to prevent the resurgence of a Trojan future. By attributing to Hecuba the power to save Paris, Euripides ma- nipulates the story in such a way that the current situation becomes an iteration; here too the mother, Andromache, appears to be able to de- termine the fate of the child. Menelaus in his first appearance asks Andromache to choose between her life or that of her baby (381-83); she, like Hecuba, chooses to save the child, and so leaves the safety of the shrine of Thetis. Immediately, however, Spartan treachery is re- vealed, for Menelaus or his daughter will kill her child in spite of An- dromache's self-sacrifice (430-34). There appears to be no protector for the child. The Judgment of Paris leads inexorably to the death of Iphigenia, the death of Astyanax, the death of Polyxena-and now, it seems, the death of Molossus.29 The iteration has, however, a variant- 28On the history and variations of the exposure theme in the story of Paris see Stinton, Euripides and the Judgement 22, 51-56. 29Stinton (Euripides and the Judgement 22) points out that Euripides' use of Cas- sandra as the interpreter of the dream adds dramatic potency to the scene, for she is inevitably a symbol of Troy's doom. Storey ("Domestic Disharmony") enumerates the series of disruptions of the normal parent-child relationship in the play-the death of Astyanax, the secret departure of Molossus, Neoptolemus' abandonment of his child, the threat to Molossus which parallels the story of Astyanax, Hermione's childlessness, Menelaus' desertion of his daughter, and the description of Orestes' matricide-which he regards as vertical extensions of the image of oikos presented in the marriage theme. See 380</page><page sequence="11">LITERARY CREATION IN ANDROMACHE the child might survive, as did Paris-but neither this outcome nor his death bodes well for the future of the Greek house of Peleus or of the Trojan survivors. Again, however, Euripides revises the paradigm of the doomed or doom-bearing child. Peleus arrives to rescue mother and child, and Hermione experiences great remorse over her murderous plot against them, as well as great fear over Neoptolemus' reaction when he hears of her evil (804-10). Both the rescue and Hermione's recognition of her own wrongdoing further separate the Spartan Greeks-who kill chil- dren-from the Phthian Greeks, who simultaneously move into ever closer alliance with the Trojans. Similarly, the mother's-a Trojan mother's-refusal to sacrifice her son at the same time replays and breaks the pattern, for here murder will not follow murder. Instead Thetis sends the child safely off with his mother to regenerate the heroic lines of Hector and Achilles. A fourth essential element in the story of the Judgment and its consequences is the abduction of Helen and the ensuing war. This story, which was recounted in the Cypria, was and is probably the best- known example of the not infrequent abduction stories in Greek my- thology. Herodotus considered the event as the final episode in a series of altercations between Asians and Greeks over women. The stories of Io, Europa, Medea, and Helen create a narrative pattern that demon- strates not only the significance of the place of women in the mainte- nance of social order but also the importance of the erotic motive in history. The abduction of Helen is replicated in the Iliad with the story of Briseis; there, however, the conflict over women is no longer between Asia and Greece but between Greeks themselves, Agamemnon and Achilles. Embedded in each version of the narrative is the cultural message; the importance of possessing women extends beyond the indi- cation of wealth and status to signify the stability of the household.30 Thus Menelaus' journey to Troy is not only to regain his property and honor but also to avenge the destruction of his household and perhaps to reestablish it. also Conacher, Euripidean Drama 172, for a focus on dynasty rather than on the fates of individual characters. These perspectives reinforce my identification of underlying pat- terns that are fundamental to Euripides' configuration of the plot. 30In the case of Briseis, of course, the household and its future are redefined by war into the grouping of Achilles, Briseis, and Patroclus, and the survival of the first. 381</page><page sequence="12">CHRISTINA ELLIOTT SORUM Euripides utilizes the paradigm of abduction and subsequent con- flict over the possession of a woman repeatedly in Andromache. He sets the form when Andromache sings of Helen brought to lofty Ilium and into the bridal chamber (104) and then of her own departure from the city, her bridal chamber, and her husband (112). In the following epi- sodes, Euripides creates three variations of the conflict over Helen: first, Menelaus contests Peleus' claim to Andromache with the woman herself; second, Menelaus contests Peleus' claim to Andromache with Peleus; and third, Orestes asserts his own claim to Hermione. The first example of the contest over a woman is startlingly inven- tive, for the woman not only presents her own case, but she is a slave woman arguing with the king of Sparta, a hero from Troy. Yet as An- dromache speaks she reshapes the unique moment into the familiar pattern. From the start she creates an aura of epic nostalgia when she claims that Neoptolemus, a hero at Troy and a man worthy of Peleus and Achilles, will rescue her (339-44), and again when she reviles Menelaus for the spineless susceptibility to women that leads him into trouble-now on behalf of his daughter (326), before on behalf of his wife (362-63).31 Likewise she recalls the horror of the death of As- tyanax, of the mutilation of Hector, and of the burning of Troy. It is from her epic role as a paragon of conjugal and maternal virtue that she attacks the barren Hermione and, as the mother of the murdered son, that she chooses to sacrifice her own life for that of her second child (406-10). In other words, Euripides generates the present contest through a consistent portrayal of Andromache. Finally, in her attack on Spartan treachery, Andromache conflates an epic past, a dramatic pres- ent, and the audience's contemporary experience to achieve a universal model (445-63). The new story of Menelaus likewise develops from old patterns. In response to Andromache's charge of exhibiting a weakness for women, he says, with a sense of historical self-awareness, "Know well, whatever someone happens to need, this is for each more important than taking Troy" (368-69). His observation, at first glance simply a bit of sophistry, in fact explains not only his own expedition to Troy but other moments in the stories of heroes where the public enterprise is disrupted by private need. Most notable is Paris' choice of Aphrodite, 310n this particular failing in the Euripidean Menelaus see Blaiklock, Male Char- acters 74-100. 382</page><page sequence="13">LITERARY CREATION IN ANDROMACHE but similarly motivated are Achilles' withdrawal from battle in response to the loss of his Briseis and his return in search of a personal ven- geance for the death of his beloved Patroclus. Here, as before, Mene- laus considers marriage the important issue-which is not surprising in light of his personal history. His insistence that the loss of a husband is the equivalent of death for a woman is, however, ironic given his own experience with Helen (373). Finally, the man who previously de- manded the death of his brother's daughter to satisfy his personal need is here ready to kill the child of Andromache; again the iteration bol- sters the innovative moment. In the contest in the third episode, Andromache again confounds past and present. She calls upon her husband for help, but she refers now to the dead Hector and not to Neoptolemus (523-25). It is Peleus, however, who responds-a father, not a husband; a Greek, not a Trojan. The old man upon his arrival continues the woman's argument with Menelaus. The father of Achilles and the brother of Agamemnon quar- rel over the right to Andromache as their epic kin did over Briseis (581- 89); once again a son of Atreus has laid his hands on another's woman (584-86). Peleus makes a series of charges, many of which recall pre- vious crimes. Menelaus fought a war for a worthless woman, and now he does violence for the daughter, who is no better than her faithless mother (590-623). Just as Menelaus demanded that Agamemnon butcher the innocent Iphigenia, he now binds a poor mother and son for slaughter (624-35, 633-34). Peleus holds the Spartan accountable for Achilles' death, not the Trojans (615), and remembers Menelaus as a braggart strutter at Troy, as ineffectual then as he will be proved to be now. The old Phthian declares in conclusion that he will not be a lesser enemy than Paris was to Menelaus (706-7) and that he will raise his grandson in Phthia to be a great enemy to the Spartans (723-24). Thus Euripides shifts the locus of hostility from between Greek and Trojan to between Spartan and Phthian-or Phthian-Trojan, for simultaneously Peleus strengthens the identification of his household with Andromache and her son.32 Menelaus responds with a xenophobic tirade against the old man that is similar to Hermione's against Andromache (645-690). His charges culminate in the accusation that Peleus would allow Greeks to 32 See also Conacher (Euripidean Drama 172-73), who comments on these shifting alliances. 383</page><page sequence="14">CHRISTINA ELLIOTT SORUM be ruled by men of foreign blood, barbarians (663-66)-a play to patri- otism that ignores the Greek father of Andromache's son.33 He claims that Helen, a victim chosen by the gods, benefited the Greeks greatly by granting them experience in arms and battle that made them men (680-83), but this bit of sophistry blatantly contradicts his own earlier appeal to the suffering of the Greeks at Troy (653-56).34 Nevertheless, the collapse of the Spartan king in the face of a weak old man's anger is inexplicable if it is isolated from the mythic paradigm exploited in Peleus' attack; Menelaus loses to Peleus as Agamemnon lost to Achil- les. Furthermore, the occasion duplicates the moral as well as the famil- ial model. The legitimate spouse Menelaus triumphed over libidinous Paris, noble Achilles triumphed over tyrannical Agamemnon, and now the virtuous Phthian triumphs over the bullying Spartan. The subse- quent expressions of ethical aphorisms by the chorus-best to be born in an affluent house; good men's glory is never obscured; better not to achieve disgraceful success; let the unjust family or empire not pros- per-by universalizing the situation, further explain the defeat of the Spartan king by the old man, as does the account of Peleus' adventures against the centaurs and at Troy. Both the mythological tradition and moral norms legitimize and elucidate the current victory. From the argument of Peleus and Menelaus to the end of the play, the recognition of the virtue of the house of Peleus and the triumph of the Trojan remnant increases. Hermione laments the wrongs she worked against both her husband and the Trojan woman and deplores her abandonment by her father; both the daughter and the father illus- trate Spartan villainy. Yet the problem of the two women in Neopto- lemus' house does not end simply with her admission of crime. Euripides introduces one more contest over a woman to achieve a resolution-and it is by far the most complex reworking of the pattern yet. Orestes suddenly appears. He claims that he is just dropping by on his way to Dodona, but upon learning of the trouble in the household he reveals that he has come to take away the woman who had been prom- 33 See Hall, Inventing the Barbarian 196-97, for consideration of this popular rhe- torical topos. See also Iphigenia at Aulis 1400-1401. 34Stevens (Euripides: Andromache 177) remarks that he knows of no other extant example of this particular argument but that it may not have been invented by Euripides, as the working out of arguments in defense of Helen was probably a regular rhetorical exercise. 384</page><page sequence="15">LITERARY CREATION IN ANDROMACHE ised to him by Menelaus (957-69). Orestes attempts to cast himself as a victim, deprived of his rightful bride. In this role he would be a Mene- laus, husband of a stolen Helen. Euripides realigns the characters, how- ever, in such a way as to deny to Orestes the righteous role. In this fi- nal iteration of a contest for a woman, a Greek, the son of Menelaus' brother, steals the woman from the house of another Greek, a Phthian and an ally of the Trojans. As in the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achil- les, the fault lies at the door of the house of Atreus, while the pious Phthian, a suppliant at Delphi, emerges as a blameless-although, as we soon learn, dead-husband. In the subsequent stasimon (1009-46) describing the bloody havoc that occurred at Troy and in Argos, the chorus questions why the gods caused such destruction, but following Orestes' decision to abscond with the willing Hermione and his an- nouncement that he had set a deadly trap for Neoptolemus, it is easy to attribute the sorrows of both the Greeks and the Trojans to the wanton daughters of Tyndareus and their progeny. Each time the singular aspects of the particular contests are estab- lished as a seemingly crucial element of the plot-a slave woman argu- ing with a Spartan hero, the Greek Peleus defending members of the Trojan family that killed his son, Orestes claiming Neoptolemus' wife as his own-iterations materialize that both recall the original para- digms and extend their implications. In a plot that to such a large degree exploits the unexpected-the defeat of the beautiful young woman by the old slave and of the vigorous Menelaus by old Peleus, the unex- pected arrival of Orestes, the elaborate scheme to murder the sightsee- ing Neoptolemus-Euripides tells the same story. Is Euripides deliberately trying to make a point with his repeated use of elements from the Judgment, or does the iteration simply repre- sent an unconscious creative habit that is the product of an individual nurtured in a society permeated by traditional stories? Certainly it is plausible to read the patterns as manifestations of the inevitably limited nature of human experience; men everywhere fight over women as sex- ual objects and as property. Orestes' words of hatred and his murderous plotting against Neoptolemus do not seem to indicate an end to this particular sequence of strife, nor does the chorus's fourth stasimon indicate any closure; Apollo and Poseidon doomed Troy, Phoebus doomed the house of Atreus, and women suffered throughout Greece and Troy (1008-46). The report of the death of Neoptolemus in the exodos (1047-1288) appears as yet another link in the unending narrative 385</page><page sequence="16">CHRISTINA ELLIOTT SORUM of sorrows that arose from the Judgment of Paris, as does Peleus' sub- sequent lament over the marriage of his grandson to Hermione that has destroyed his house, a lament that could equally well be any Greek's over the marriage of Menelaus to Helen, or any Trojan's over the mar- riage of Paris to Helen.35 Yet the iterations have a linear as well as a cyclic movement that indicates the author's aim. Euripides has recast the paradigmatic ele- ments of the traditional story of the Judgment in such a way as to steadily separate the Phthians from the other Greeks and to strengthen their ties with the Trojans. Simultaneously he has relegated wrongdoing to the house of Atreus, the Spartan men and their women who stand revealed as the liars, the unchaste, the murderers of children, the cow- ards, and the deserters.36 The play, which began at the shrine of Thetis where Andromache sought refuge from a Spartan, ends with the sea goddess's appearance beside the corpse of her grandson, the victim of a Spartan. The wedding of Peleus and Thetis, which previously signified the beginning of the story of the Judgment that culminated in the fall of Troy, is now a source of resolution.37 Thetis prophesies the future for the descendants of the Phthians and Trojans, for the descendant of Achilles and the house of Hector through Andromache. The noble heroes of the Iliad are joined in the child, and the remnant flourishes (1250). Peleus achieves divine status through his marriage, and together he and his wife are reunited in paradise with their son. Euripides uses elements of the story of the Judgment of Paris to construct his plot, and thus he validates the new story as he "invents" a tradition. Equally significantly, he recasts the patterns of the Judgment as he fills in gaps in the stories of Andromache, Hermione, Neoptole- mus, and Orestes. A virtuous woman is vindicated as a source of gener- ation. A faithful husband has his reward-in the case of Peleus, immor- 35Storey ("Domestic Disharmony") notes the many matches that are important in the play-Andromache/Hector, Andromache/Neoptolemus, Neoptolemus/Hermione, Peleus/Thetis, Orestes/Hermione, and, less directly, Menelaus/Helen, Paris/Helen, and Agamemnon/Clytemnestra. Again this emphasis on iterative themes reinforces my analy- sis of Euripides' method of story making. 36For another interpretation of the shifting attributions of good and evil see Con- acher, Euripidean Drama, esp. 173-75. 37Storey ("Domestic Disharmony" 20) suggests with regard to the various inter- pretations of Thetis' epiphany: "On the other hand, Thetis may just be that rare creature, a truly benevolent Euripidean deity." 386</page><page sequence="17">LITERARY CREATION IN ANDROMACHE tality. The trouble caused by promiscuous women and the violent men who desire them is relegated to the enemy camp. Those who before were victims of the erotic impulse of Helen and Paris emerge into a brighter future-but not in the land in which their stories had been told.
