<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dennis Rygiel Style in Twentieth-Century Literary Nonfiction in English: An Annotated Bibliography of Criticism, 1980-88 My intent here is to carry forward to 1988 the bibliography on literary nonfiction that I compiled for the years 1960-79, published in Style in Volume 15, Spring and Summer 1981. 1 have followed the same principles of definition and inclusion as before. Three points bear repeating. First, the focus is on criticism that deals with the style of individual writers and individual works of literary nonfiction. Second, style is interpreted in a broad, inclusive sense, encompassing not only aspects of language (syntax, diction, sound), but also rhetorical strategies and narrative techniques, structure, and presentation of self (voice, persona, point of view, tone). Third, literary nonfiction is also interpreted broadly and inclusively: "literary" meaning any work treated by critics as literature; "nonfiction" meaning any work classified by critics as such. Thus the category includes works which until recently have lain outside the traditional boundaries of literature (e.g., Emma Goldman's speeches and writ- ings, Woody Allen's comedy, Ellen Goodman's columns) as well as works whose classification is problematic and/or the subject of critical debate (e.g., Leacock's Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town , Woolf s Three Guineas , Mailer's The Executioner's Song). As for approach, I have again used the annual bib- liographies in Style (1980-86) and in the MLA International Bibliography (1980-87). Some changes in these bibliographies have made them easier to use and more helpful than they were in the past for the kind of search involved here. With the Style bibliographies I am thinking particularly of the index of subject-authors, added from 1980 on. With the MLA bibliographies I have in mind the format adopted in 1981, which usually provides some, if not all, of the following information: classification of the entry according to the nature of the work studied (Autobiography, Prose); title(s) of the work(s) studied; and descriptors indicating the nature and/or scope of the study (e.g., treatment of the self, narrative technique, style). But I do need to add a qualification or two. The MLA bibliographies classify as fiction several of the works included here as nonfiction, for example, the works just mentioned by Leacock, Woolf, and Mailer. And the descriptors in these bibliographies, while useful as a preliminary screening device, are not sufficient by themselves to determine what items should be entered in a bibliography such as this or to identify what aspect(s) of style should be noted for a particular entry. There is no substitute for examining the items, which I have been able to do in almost all cases. One 566 Style: Volume 23, No. 4, Winter 1989</page><page sequence="2">Style in Twentieth-Century Nonfiction 567 final point about approach. I have again surveyed 64 scholarly journals (listed below); however, this time, because of the great increase in published criticism on the topic, I have not included dissertations. Before presenting the bibliography itself, I would like to indicate some- thing of the way in which this area of criticism has been developing. The simplest way to do so is to compare the earlier bibliography with the present one, for while having no pretensions to completeness, the two bibliographies do provide the basis for at least a rough sketch of the published criticism over the last three decades. To facilitate comparisons, I have included only the 201 published items from the earlier bibliography, and I have divided that bibli- ography into two nine-year periods, beginning with 1962 (there was just one entry for 1960-61). Table 1 presents the findings. What is immediately apparent is the striking increase in activity: a dou- bling of entries between 1962-70 and 1971-79, and even more than another doubling between 1971-79 and 1980-88. To some extent the increase is related to growing critical interest over the past 20 years or so in nonfiction in general and twentieth-century nonfiction in particular, especially as the boundaries Table 1 Number of Entries for Each Nine- Year Period 1962-70 1971-79 1980-88 Total 67 135 300 Sub- categories3 Academic prose (criticism, history, etc.) 7 10 17 Autobiography 8 35 106 Biography 2 2 9 Essay 31 48 88 Journalism 2 19 New Journalism 5 32 35 Travel literature 3 5 21 aSince some entries deal with more than one sub-category, and since minor sub-categories such as diaries, letters, and sketches are not included, the totals for the sub- categories do not add up to the totals for the entries.</page><page sequence="3">568 Dennis Rygiel become blurred between literature and non-literature, fiction and nonfiction. More specifically, though, as the breakdown into sub-categories in Table 1 shows, the growth in critical interest has been concentrated in three areas: autobiography, the essay, and New Journalism. The main thrust of much of the criticism on this nonfiction is, as one might expect, its fictivity. Two large and powerful critical currents come together here- interest in the theory and practice of narrative and the often related interest in the construction/pres- entation of the self. Both are involved in the stylistic criticism of much twen- tieth-century nonfiction, affecting most obviously and consistently the work on autobiography, but also influencing in varying degrees the work on biog- raphy, New Journalism, travel literature, and narrative essays. In the most recent period covered, the one surveyed in the present bibliography, aspects of narrative and of the creation/treatment/presentation of the self (a concern in non-narrative essays as well) are clearly the dominant focuses, with aspects of one or both being studied in roughly two-thirds of the entries. What this activity means in practice is that style in the narrow sense of linguistic detail (syntax, diction, sound) receives less attention than it did in earlier criticism, and that formalist approaches to nonfiction are not being used as much. For example, there is less interest in the 1 980's in quantitative studies (particularly of syntax) of the sort done in the 1960's and 1970's (e.g., Francis Christensen's Notes Toward a New Rhetoric, Robert Cluett's Prose Style and Critical Reading, Mary P. Hiatt's Artful Balance and The Way Women Write). In this regard critical practice seems to be in tacit agreement with the view expressed by Donald C. Freeman in a recent review of Richard A. Lanham's Analyzing Prose ( College Composition and Communication 37 [1986]: 109): "Large prose texts resist rigor and systematicity, and I do not think linguistics has helped or is likely to help in their analysis." However, there is one aspect of style in the narrow sense that still does receive a good deal of attention in criticism of nonfiction, though the approach is not usually linguistic, but rhe- torical, psychological, or political. I am speaking of course of metaphor, which figures heavily in the fictivity of nonfiction, whether through metaphors of self in autobiography and the essay or through metaphors of social phenomena and relationships in New Journalism. To this point I have been talking about changing patterns of critical interest in particular genres of nonfiction and particular aspects of style. Now I would like to say something about these changing patterns as they affect study of particular authors. Table 2 provides a perspective. Only three authors appear on all three lists: Capote, Orwell, and Law- rence. The interest in Capote is related to the strong interest in New Journalism, an interest which has remained steady over an 1 8-year period, and which also accounts for the presence on the lists of Mailer, Didion, Tom Wolfe, and (as a predecessor) James Agee. The steady interest in Orwell is significant because it ties in with the movement of literary criticism in recent years toward political</page><page sequence="4">Style in Twentieth-Century Nonfiction 569 Table 2 The Ten Authors Receiving Most Study 1962-70 1971-79 1980-88 H.

Lawrence (5) Sean O'Casey (8) Vladimir Nabokov (5) Robert Pirsig (8) Anais Nin (5) Tom Wolfe (8) and social issues. The interest in Lawrence, which has increasingly been in his travel writings, is related to both political and psychological thrusts in con- temporary criticism. Most of the other authors on the lists, especially the last two lists, are there because of the tremendous contemporary interest in au- tobiography: Malcolm X, Stein, Yeats, T. E. Lawrence, Nabokov, Kingston, Wright, Hellman, O'Casey, Pirsig. The surge of interest in the 1980's in four of these autobiographers (Kingston, Wright, Hellman, O'Casey) and in Virginia Woolf is due as well to the powerful political and social currents in criticism already alluded to, particularly the concern with how language, culture, gender, race, and/or ethnicity affect the telling of a story, the making and presentation of a self. The same concerns, I might add, appear with many of the other authors represented in this bibliography, especially those who are from Canada, Ireland, or New Zealand; those who belong to a minority group; and those who are women. The greater representation of women writers in the criticism is particularly striking: in the 18 years covered in the earlier bibliography, there were 48 references to women in the index of subject-authors; in this bibliog- raphy, which covers just nine years, there are 111 references. In sum, stylistic criticism of twentieth-century literary nonfiction in En- glish is a healthy enterprise. It is flourishing as never before; the sheer numbers attest to that. But more importantly, because of strong influence from the</page><page sequence="5">570 Dennis Rygiel political and social currents in contemporary literary criticism, the recent sty- listic work does not, as previous criticism sometimes did, tend to isolate style from all that makes style meaningful or to isolate literature from life.
