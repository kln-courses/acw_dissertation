<plain_text><page sequence="1">BERGSON AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION E. C. WILM Professor of Philosophy in Wells College Author of "The Problem of Religion," "The Culture of Religion," "The Philosophy of Friedrich Schiller" A question of deep interest to many persons is that of the bearing of any new and original system of philosophy like that of Henri Bergson upon current religious interests and ideas. A few reflections upon this topic may, therefore, not come amiss at this time. It is very clear that if we are to con- sider the question at all intelligently or profitably we must first come to some sort of understanding as to just what we shall mean by religion. It is obvious, for example, that the question of the bearings of Bergson's teachings upon religion would have to be answered very differently in case we should identify religion with the dogmas of traditional theology, and in case we should take a freer view of its nature and meaning. The effect of Bergson's philosophy upon the traditional doctrines of theology might be almost wholly negative (unless, indeed, these doctrines were interpreted very freely and symbolically), while it might strongly corroborate and support a religion defined more generously and vitally. The view of religion which we shall adopt for the present purpose is that it is based upon the belief in the permanence of goodness, upon the belief that the universe is so constituted as ever to prefer the good and to destroy the evil. Defining it very shortly, we might say (using words of Secretan) that religion is the belief that perfection is eternal, or, in words of my own (of which I am fond, in spite of their anthropomorphic asso- ciations), it is the belief in love. Whether such a belief as this is possible for us is a question, it seems plain, which can be settled partly upon the basis of factual or empirical evidence, in spite of the suggestion of James and others that the question, if it is to be answered favorably to religion, must be removed out of the realm of factual demonstration to the realm of faith and practical endeavor. James's wholesale condemnation of the empirical order as morally ambiguous or even bad seems to me, indeed, somewhat overwrought and harsh. "Every phenomenon that we would praise there," he writes, "exists cheek by jowl with some contrary phenomenon that cancels all its religious effect upon the mind. Beauty and hideousness, love and cruelty, life and death keep house together in indissoluble partnership; and gradually there steals over us, instead of the old warm notion of a man-loving deity, that of an awful power that neither hates nor loves, but rolls all things together meaninglessly to a common doom." I do not wish here to enter upon the question of the com- parative amounts of good and evil in the 279</page><page sequence="2">280 THE BIBLICAL WORLD world, the question of optimism and pessimism, viewed from a merely his- torical or descriptive point of view. I have presented the case for religion, i.e., for the belief in the preponderance of good, somewhat fully in my recent book, The Problem of Religion, where the reader will find my opinions and argu- ments, if he should care for them. It is of course clear, and it may be granted without further discussion, that the belief in the present preponderance or the eventual triumph of good, while capable of much empirical support, is in the nature of the case not susceptible of complete empirical confirmation, which must forever remain a philosophical aspiration rather than a definite achieve- ment. It is clear, however, and may readily be conceded, that the question of primary importance for religion is not whether the good is actually realized, but whether it is realizable in a world like this; whether the progressive victory of good over evil, of reasonableness and aspiration over unreasonableness and fate and chance, is something for which, in the actual constitution of the world, we may fairly hope for and work for, Moreover, and particularly, no moral evaluation of the universe can be regarded as at all adequate which leaves out of account man's active nature, which reckons up the chances of good and ill from the consideration of the physical forces, merely, which the world represents, leaving out of account the efficacy of human aspiration, the active energy of human agents. James was right when he asserted that for any philosophy to succeed it must avoid two fundamental defects: it must not in its ultimate principle baffle and disappoint our most cherished powers, and, second, it must not define the world in such a way as to give our active powers no object whatever to press against. The two kinds of existence, in other words, which would be unendurable is that in which all problems are hopeless and all striving therefore vain, and that in which all problems are already solved. The real foe of religion, or of any hopeful interpretation of reality, is, therefore, not naturalism, as is so often asserted, but absolutism in every form; whether absolutism be of the naturalistic and mechanical type contemplated by physi- cal science, or of the logical or teleological type of absolute idealism. Both sys- tems leave man out of account; both deny what he feels to be the most inviolable part of his nature, his activity in the pursuit of his ends, the freedom and efficacy of his own life. If the question is asked, then, what, in a word, the constitution of the world would be which the moral nature of man can approve, in which trust and aspiration are appropriate moods, rather than fear and despair, the answer would be that it must be a world in which human ends can be truly achieved, though not with- out effort, struggle, and perhaps much pain. We are now fairly in position to estimate the bearing of Bergson's system upon any world-view which can be called religious. The three salient doctrines of Bergson which have relevancy in the present connection are the doctrines of creative evolution, of indeterminate tele- ology, and of human freedom. They will be seen, when they are examined from our present point of view, to be broadly</page><page sequence="3">BERGSON AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 281 in keeping with a view of the world upon which, as we have held, religion de- pends. A few words upon each point will perhaps make the matter clear. I. The view of evolution as creative provides for novelty in the world, and for the appearance of features, therefore, which, though not actually existent, are ideally demanded. It denied mechan- istic naturalism which views nature as a closed system whose changes are due, not to the efficacy of ideals and intelli- gent endeavor, but to the shifting and reshifting of forces in accordance with mechanical forces working blindly. Evolution according to Bergson, is not a mere rethreshing of old straw, eternal redistribution of matter and energy. Evolution, rather, is elaboration, pro- duction, a process in which fresh items of reality spring constantly into existence. The theological doctrine of creation is not only unassailable, it expresses the most central truth about the world which it is possible to utter. Tradi- tional theology errs only in treating the act of creation as singular and final, and in referring it back to some mythical point in the past. Creation is not con- fined to the past: it is taking place continually. That science should not recognize the creative and spontaneous aspects of evolution, but should interpret it in purely mechanical terms, is entirely natural in view of the object which science has set for itself. If there is genuine spontaneity in the world, science, whose ideal is calculation and prediction, must ignore it, just as psychology must ignore free will, if such a thing indeed exists. We are here merely restating, from a somewhat different point of view, the central point of Bergson's whole criticism of science, a criticism which will doubtless stand the test of utmost scrutiny. The only true science, according to Bergson, would be history, the science which deals with the concrete and the individual, rather than the abstract and conceptual. The unique and the individual, just because it is unique and individual, forever eludes the notional grasp. 2. But if Bergson's system is un- friendly to absolute creation theories, it is equally unfriendly to all forms of absolute teleology. If there is no abso- lute creation, in the sense of traditional, theology, there is also no absolute predestination. The course of evolution is not mapped out, as it were, before- hand, so that no one, not even God, "can see the end from the beginning." The life of God himself lies before him largely in the form of an unrealized possibility, like the life of the youth whose vast and ill-defined aspirations and impulses are symptomatic of certain energies and tendencies, without, how- ever, affording any clear hint or sign of the final outcome of the great adventure of life which he confronts. Prophecy is therefore not so much a form of prognostication as a form of poetry. Its message is not primarily oracular, but normative and hortative. Its fictive utterances stir the imagination and the will, and thus bring events about through the release of human energies, rather than foretell, merely, a consum- mation which Nature, left to herself, would have achieved. 3. The whole of Bergson's philosophy, like the whole philosophy of religion, is thus seen to center in freedom. The</page><page sequence="4">282 THE BIBLICAL WORLD universe is a product of free creation simply because it is not force or mechan- ism, but freedom and life. The opera- tion of freedom we witness at first hand in man, where the will liberates itself from the rule of matter and shapes life in conformity with its own ends and goals. That such freedom is not unlimited and does not operate capriciously and in independence of the order of nature is a point which cannot be emphasized too strongly. The charwomen, in Sir Oliver Lodge's illustration, who break into the scientist's laboratory and disturb his scientific results upset no laws of nature in doing so. They disturb the results merely by disarranging the conditions which the scientist has carefully pre- pared. I can by merely pressing a lever switch a locomotive from one track to another, according to my will. I can even derail it entirely by placing an obstacle upon the track. But what I can- not do is to keep it from moving along the lines of least resistance. Thus, while I can side-track the engine, or even upset it, I cannot deviate or upset the laws of nature. It is of course clear on a very little thought that the only condition on which I can carry out the purposes of my will is by the use of agents, by relying upon the uniformity of nature without which all ends would become unreal- izable, all purposes unfulfilled, and life itself become a sheer impossibility. Indeed, the more one reflects on the matter the clearer it becomes that the constancy of nature is the one most important argument for theism which can be produced. That the ground is firm under our feet, that water slakes and fire burns, that bodies gravitate, that the sun rises and sets and the seasons recur-that nature, in short, is without shadow or turning-this is the one con- dition on which life can be good. It is of the utmost importance to emphasize this point here because reli- gion has often been thought to depend for its "proof" upon the interruption of the order of nature, upon miracles. The doctrine of miracles has often, even quite recently, been asserted to stand or fall with the doctrine of free will. Nature, it is asserted, cannot be a closed system of physical forces operating according to uniform laws, and the will be at the same time free. Either nature is not a closed system or free will is a miracle. "You cannot consistently hold," one writer says, "that psychical miracles are pos- sible and hold that physical miracles are impossible." Well, one would likely not gain much reputation for logic and still less for common-sense if one were to argue that he could by an act of volition raise his arm, and that therefore he could by an act of volition raise the dead. But this is precisely what the argument above would come to. Perhaps the best way to deal with a logician of this type would be to invite him to test the quality of his logic by actually trying his power in the two directions. It is a fact frequently observed that gains in this world are seldom made without corresponding risks and losses, and, particularly, that the truth can never be taught without danger of mis- conception and misinterpretation. A brilliant instance of the latter fact was the late William James, who suggested that the scientific-academic mind shows an extraordinary slowness in acknowl- edging "facts to exist which present themselves as wild facts, with no stall or</page><page sequence="5">BERGSON AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 283 pidgeon hole," and was forthwith hailed as leader by every form of mysticism and occultism. The magazines of faith (never very inactive) were lighted in numberless breasts of men and women, and the floodgates were thrown wide for "spiritualists," faith healers, telepa- thists, and mystery-mongers of every class and name. Bergson is at the present time in danger of suffering the same evil fate. Doctrinaires as widely apart as syndicalists, socialists, and anarchists have claimed him for their leader. The forces (always with us in disquieting numbers) arrayed against the existing social order seem to have derived a peculiar comfort from the Bergsonian writings. The whole ten- dency is vividly reminiscent of the Rousseauan "back-to-nature" move- ment of the eighteenth century. Nature is distinctionless, streaming; the dif- ferentiation and organization which it shows is a mere human artifice, and hence imperfect. "God made the coun- try and man made the town"; whence it follows that existent society is an evil which ought to be resisted. Of such and similar unprofitable aberrations the newspapers and magazines are now full. From the other side comes traditional theology and finds in Bergson's doctrines the warrant for a whole array of doctrines which, to say the least, should not be drawn from the position of obscurity to which the progress of time has assigned them without being subjected to very complete revision, miracles (I quote from an influential religious newspaper), "the fall, sin, revelation, redemption." These ancient doctrines doubtless have profound significance if it can be freed from the accumulation of theological verbiage which weight it down and hide it from view. If Bergsonism will give us a truly modern theology it will confer a great intellectual and spiritual benefit; but a new theology which shall be really abreast with modern knowledge and sentiment can be gained only, I am persuaded, by going forward, not back- ward to the old conceptions and dis- tinctions. What is one man's meat is another's poison. Doubtless, what scientists need is to be reminded of the limitation of mere analysis and abstract intellection, and to practice intuition and insight. What occultists and dreamers need is "that the northwest wind of science should get into them and blow their sickliness and barbarism away." And what all good men and women need is to be freed from misgivings and fear, and to be fortified in their better resolutions, so as to fit them for the highest task of which a man is capable, the task, namely, of sustaining and furthering the interests of right and of truth. To these ends, we may feel sure, no one would be more anxious to contribute than Bergson himself.</page></plain_text>
