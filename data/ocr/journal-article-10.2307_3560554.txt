"I love thee, 0 Lord, my strength. The Lord is my stronghold, my fortress and my champion, My God, my rock where Ifind safety, My shield, my mountain refuge, my strong tower." -Psalm 18, New English Bible "In trying to solve the terrifying problems that face us in the world today, we naturally turn to the things we do best. We play from strength, and our strength is science and technology." B.F. Skinner Beyond Freedom and Dignity (opening lines) N ot sinc The Greening of America, way back last year, has a book called forth as much immediate attention as Skinner's Beyond Free- dom and Dignity.* Doubtless this means Skinner, like Reich, has taken up the main threads of our lives and we are desperately anxious to see whether he weaves or snarls them. The comparison with the Psalm above underlines the ambiguity of our situation. Forgetting for a moment possible offences to piety and the fact Skinner does not write as well as the translators, there is much to be said at the outset for his approach. He speaks of us as a society, not as individuals looking for strength. His agent of strength is our own collective activity, not divine action we accept passively. Our strength, for him, is for facing the world, not for resting in a safe mountain refuge. On the other hand, where he treats strength as a solving- agent for life's problems, the Psalmist's first approach is with love, a more deeply human attitude toward some- thing as basic as strength. For all the importance of play in our overworking society, "we play from strength" *B.F. Skinner, Beyond Freedom and Dignity (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1971). sounds like Dr. Strangelove. And where the Psalmist sounds just delighted that the Lord is his strength, Skinner's words introduce his point that science and technology cause our terrifying problems as well as offer a way out. Skinner's main point is well taken. Our physical and biological sciences have given us tremendous power and have reshaped our world. But no science of human behavior has de- veloped to retool our own activity in the new dispensation. Skinner says we have developed nuclear,power but not the behavior to use it judiciously. Long ago physics and the other sciences gave up belief in will, intentions and purposes, but theories of human behavior have been reluctant to abandon those categories. (Of all things, we have been stuck with an anthropomorphic anthropology!) According to Skinner, even those who abandon such mentalistic talk mistakenly think that the cause of behavior lies in something outside behavior, e.g. physiology. The proper approach, he has said for years, is to think of behavior as a continuum to be understood in itself. The operant causes are not external pushes and pulls, not some internal spontaneous mind or will, but the selective factors of the environment. The theory of environmental conditioning is well enough understood not to need repetition here. Man is not autono- mous, but conditioned; he is not responsible for his behavior- responsibility lies with the environ- ment. his raises the question of Skinner's well-known attack on opposition to control in the name of freedom. It is important to understand what Skinner himself understands by freedom. Free- dom is the behavioral processes effect- ing avoidance of the "aversive" features of the environment, that is, those features we shrink from instinc- tively or because of experiential conditioning. We do not take the nonaversive influences of the environ- ment, the inducements, to be threats to freedom. So freedom is being able to do what we want and escape what we dislike, no matter how our wants and dislikes are conditioned by the environment. From this perspective it is easy to see why Skinner thinks the problem of freedom is to develop the right controls and eliminate the ones confronting us with aversive features of the environment. This is reasonable as far as it goes. B ut Skinner does not take up certain claims in the literature of freedom expressing another concep- tion of the ideal. Put perhaps best by Kant and his tradition, freedom also means man's constituting of himself as a rational being in a rational society. The value of rationality lies not just in efficiency in avoiding aversive in- fluences, but rather in the fact that a rational situation is sui generis, that it is not formed by irrational brute given conditions, that it is understandable in itself because its contents are com- pletely ordered by means-ends rela- tionships. This is autonomy in a sense quite different from Skinner's. A man is free in this sense because he creates himself, and he creates himself (and his world) by making everything in his life a means to ends he has chosen for himself. Not many people would accept Kant's defense of how this freedom is possible; but it remains an ideal. Like the attention aroused by Skinner's book itself, there must be something in the autonomy view of freedom or there wouldn't be such a fuss. The fact Skinner does not take it seriously means his arguments against it are beside the point. We can ask why he does not take it seriously, however, and the answer is no secret. Skinner believes that if behavior is conditioned by the en- vironment, as science has proved it to be in a great many ways, behavior has no features deriving from the agent over and above those contributed by the environment. Hence, autonomy is impossible. But this is a logical _A J Page 6 Y _1 f1 J -Ak ^ J</page><page sequence="2">Page 7 non-sequitur. That an event is condi- tioned does not entail that it is completely determined. Suppose an event is presented with a host of antecedent environing conditions. The event must work these conditions into a unity; otherwise it would not be an event different from the antecedent conditions. After the event, perhaps every feature of its structure can be traced back. Every event is self- creative in the sense it must make a concrete unity out of the host of antecedent conditions; if the concrete unity were already in the antecedent conditions, there could be nothing new; nothing could happen. The question for freedom, of course, is whether there are alternative patterns of integration possible, and whether these alternatives are humanly impor- tant or trivial. But this is an empirical question. And it is best left as that. Of course there are many regularities governing patterns of integration, regularities discovered by science and art; if it were not so, behavior could not be organized so as to respond to remote things, orient itself to the important rather than the trivial, or get anything done in the external world. But from the experience of Are We at I suppose that if we come to the conclusion that the very sur- vival of the species necessitates the abandonment of our concepts of freedom, or indeed the abandon- ments of our freedom, it would be necessary to do so. The question is, are we at that point? At this stage of the world's development it is fashionable to think so, and it is understandable. Given the horrors of the atomic age, it is not surprising that the most popular generalization about man in the last twenty years has been as hunter, killer, and aggres- sor. But biologically we can make a better case for man as the loving animal. No species is helpless and dependent for so large a proportion of its life span as man. Incapable of either fight or flight, the two con- men who prize creativity, it seems that not all patterns of integration are regularly determined by antecedents. How much regularity there is, is an empirical matter, and the crudity Skinner points out in behavioral sciences prevents a scientific answer from having much weight, compared, say, with the testimony of moral, artistic, religious, and play experience. Of course one could say that science by methodological necessity must assume complete determinism. But a methodological assumption carries no weight as a truth claim; and it is just as good a method to say regularities are where we find them when we look carefully. It is possible also to say determinism is presupposed by the definition of science, of rationality, of the autonomy of thought; but this is metaphysics, and metaphysics is to be avoided when the issue can be phrased just as well empirically. Skinner's interpretation of dignity, beyond which he wants to go also, is rather like his interpretation of free- dom. He sees dignity to consist in a person's getting credit for his behavior; there is no dignity in the environ- ment's getting the credit. Skinner, of that Point ? ventionally described mechanisms of survival, the defenseless and pas- sive infant survives only by the dependency apparatus. His very existence depends on the strength and support of the loving adult who will sacrifice itself, if need be, for the survival of its young. It is inconceivable that any species so designed could have survived if this were left to the chance of education and culture. One must assume that built genically into the organism is a protective response to the helpless member of the species. Nor can this be the exclusive func- tion of the mother for if it were not part of the male animal, the sub- division of labors necessary for the maintenance of this prolonged dependent young could also not exist. - Willard Gaylin Who has his hand on the reigns of power in Skinner's vision? course, believes credit goes to the environment, and therefore he take a dim view of rhetorical defenses of dignity. But again his interpretation has not caught the living waters. Dignity has to do with the sense a person has an interiority to him which is only expressed, if that, in his public observable behavior. That interiority is precisely the self-creative effort by which he integrates the conditions of his environment and his own past in each occasion of his own experience. Because of his interior creativity, credit is due him for what his integration accomplishes. But credit is also due the environment for the elements presented to be integrated. Behavior control presents an affront to dignity when it narrows the range of integrative options. And only then. But the belief that man is nothing but the product of the environment's control affronts dignity by denying its very existence. Because Skinner does not consider this dimension of dignity, his arguments against it are again beside the point. And he is led to make them, it would seem, by his bias for determinism. Skinner's limited conception of freedom and dignity guide his discus- sion of punishment and its alternatives. Punishment is itself an aversive feature of the environment, even if instituted to direct people around worse dangers. But the threat of punishment leaves people little freedom to do what they want. In a society with punishment, it seems you can still give a person credit (rather than giving his environment credit) for doing good in order to avoid it. But in Skinner's view, the situation is really the reverse: the threat of punishment should be given credit because that is what conditions the desired response. Still, punishment is so often brutal and crude; it would be good to develop more humane environmental condi- J ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- v - - _~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~~ \11</page><page sequence="3">Page 8 tions to bring about desired behavior, for instance educational ones. Skinner notes the double standard, if not hypocrisy, of people who attack punishment as undignified control but laud educational control as if control of the mind were less offensive than control of the body. he point about educational con- trol of the mind is a profound one. We are just beginning to see how much coercion is involved there. But Skin- ner's conclusion is that, if every influence is control, the practical problem is to develop optimal and humane forms of control. There is no quarrel with the preference for educa- tion over punishment. But education differs from punishment also in that its influence is not completely a matter of control. One of the dimen- sions of dignity felt by those who laud education is that men at some times can direct their behavior by reasons instead of having it directed by motives. Especially in mental behavior, men sometimes can affirm things because it seems fit to do so, not merely because the preponderance of motives leads that way. If this were not so, Skinner could not say behav- iorism is the best hypothesis because it best fits the evidence. He would have to say behaviorism is believed by him because of the way his environment has motivated him; in this case there is no reason for anyone else to believe it, and if anyone else does believe it, the reason is similarity in environments, not plausibility of the behaviorist hypothesis. Of course, the components in motivated and rational choices are much the same; the evidence for a rational choice must come from the environment. The difference comes in the way in which the environmental features are integrated, the internal process again. The interiority of rationality is a very difficult thing for a position like Skinner's, which insists on dealing with observable variables, to consider fairly. His very methodo- logical bias prevents him from having anything important to say about the rational element in education and choice, however much he thinks he can refute claims about it. Skinner is careful to draw out the implications of his view for culture. Culture evolves as the social environ- ment is changed, and evolution has reached a stage where human science is altering the social environment willy- nilly. It is time, therefore, to concen- trate seriously on a science of human behavior so that the changes we effect in our social environment can be designed in desirable ways. Even if one disagrees that the environment exerts complete control over behavior, it obviously exerts so much control that Skinner's suggestion is not only worthy but desperately necessary to be acted upon. Skinner draws out one of the most important lessons for modern man: man's freedom increases in the degree to which the environment for his activities is one that has itself been formed by his own behavior according to his own desires. Contrary to Skinner, this is not all there is to freedom. But we can take responsibil- ity for ourselves best only when the environment of our behavior is of our own making. his much acknowledged in Skin- ner's favor, a negative judgment must still be cast on his overall suggestion. In the first place, his laudatory call to scientific design of culture is issued to people who must be enslaved to the behaviorist method. When it comes to designing culture, where would he call on the artists and architects, the poets, philosophers and historians? The methodology of his conception of behavioral science would exclude the very groups in our society who raise the value questions important for problems of cultural design. Admitting the validity of his call for a more sensitive behavioral science, his con- ception of the science either must be expanded greatly, or the job of direction-setting must be given to groups more inclusive than scientific ones. The very thoroughness with which Skinner demonstrates that the disciplines dealing with values are incompatible with the methodological presuppositions of his conception of science commits him to a program too niggardly in its recognition of the richness of human life. The impov- erishment of life is not his intent, of course, but it probably is the outcome of his mistaking the methodological Y assumptions of behaviorism to be empirically proved traits of nature. This leads to an aesthetic evaluation of Skinner's program, perhaps the most important evaluation in light of the fact he sees his task to deal with the whole quality of life. Most people not antecedently committed to the behaviorist model respond to Skinner's suggestions with the feeling they would cheapen, mechanize, and engi- neer life into a robot-like quality. Skinner's answer, that control of behavior need not tend this direction, is quite right, in principle. But who has his hand on the reins of power in Skinner's vision? Not the imaginative creator, the sensitive poet, the moral hero. Rather the expert in operant conditioning. And since conditioning in animals is better understood, because experimentation there has been freer, not the human therapist but the dog-drooler will set the style of mind. In advocating the abolition of autonomous man, Skinner says: Krutch has argued that whereas the traditional view supports Hamlet's exclamation, "How like a god!," Pavlov, the be- havioral scientist, emphasized "How like a dog!" But that was a step forward. A god is the archetypal pattern of an explan- atory fiction, of a miracle- working mind, of the meta- physical. Man is much more than a dog, but like a dog he is within range of a scientific analysis. Man is, of course, within range of a scientific analysis, at least in some respects. But the dog analogy presents the wrong terms on which to make the analysis, however much the analysis is called for. The irony of Skinner's discussion is that he elevates the method of one scientific approach to the point where it can make meta- physical claims. But it is bad meta- physics. It formulates opposing views too quickly and insensitively through its own categories. It treats as apriori, theses that should be empirical. And in the valiant attempt to keep life from being nasty, brutish and short, it bodes rendering it narrow, philistine, and flat. The worst thing that can be said of a metaphysical view is that it leaves the vision of human life less rich than it found it. -Robert Neville 2K I _ _ _f 1- -A J \.</page></plain_text>
