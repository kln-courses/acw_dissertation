Ottawa, Ontario, Canada THE PROTECTION OF occupants in automobile crashes has been the subject of extensive research for many years. Aside from a myriad of other factors that have a bearing on expected occupant injuries, the use of restraints has been found to be of primary importance. Studies by Langweider in 1973 (1)*, March, et al (2) , and Cromack and Ziperman (3) in 1975, Huelke, et al (4) in 1977, and most recently, by Grime in 1979 (5) , have demonstrated beyond doubt that restraint systems (seat belts in particular) are an effective means of reducing occupant in- juries and fatalities in automobile colli- sions. People are still killed and injured, of course, while restrained in automobiles (6). No protective system can be a panacea. "The assessment of the effectiveness of any particular restraint environment, has required the development of methods and pro- cedures which can simulate an automobile crash. This is to assure adequate perfor- mance before human automobile occupants must rely upon them. This test development ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. work, of which numerous examples appear in the literature, has questioned this simula- tion: Be it a sled or a barrier simulation (7, 8), dummy or cadaver simulation (9, 10), what are the benefits of mathematical models (8, 11) and studies with volunteers (11, 12, 13)? This type of work, not all of which can be reviewed here, has led to the development of foimal, prescribed laws about how such protection must be assessed. STANDARD REQUIREMENT Occupant crash protection in automobiles available in Canada is addressed in Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, "Seat Belt Installation". Certain amendments to the Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations have recently been pro- posed which, while maintaining the require- ments for active seat belts, ammends the op- tional requirements for passive occupant pro- tection, the number and location of anthropo- morphic test devices utilized during the test- ing and the maximum axial force transmitted through the upper leg (14) . ABSTRACT The origin and development of the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) has been reviewed. The concept of correlating internal head injury with measured kinematics has also been re-examined. It is concluded that since no general kinematic correlation can be developed, the HIC concept is invalid. Recent attempts to develop rela- tionships between head injury AIS and HIC, are shown to substantiate this view. Alternatives to HIC are reviewed and other approaches to head injury assessment are proposed. 1098 0096-736X/81 /8904-4098 $02. 50 Copyright 1981 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">The portions of the proposed regulations of interest here are as follows: "(11) Every anthropomorphic test device referred to in paragraph (16) (a) and (b) shall (a) undergo such a resultant acceleration at the centre of gra- vity of the head that the numerical value of the expression r2y J2 2'5(t2-ti) h does not exceed 1000, where "a" is the resultant acceleration expressed as a multiple of "g" and "g" is the acceleration due to gravity, and either (i) "t", and "t9", are any two -L l, points in the time measured in seconds during the impact, or (ii) "tj", and u^2 9 are an^ two points in time measured in seconds during any interval when the head is in continuous contact with a part of the vehicle other than the seat belt system when the anthropomorphic test device is restrained by a seat belt system." The above statements constitute the Head Injury Criterion (HIC). HEAD INJURY CRITERION It should be recognized that the HIC is an empirical formulation that is based upon experimental work. This criterion can be generally applicable only if the following is true. (1) The experimental data upon which it is based is accurate and truly reflects liv- ing human resistance to impact trauma. (2) The approximation to the experi- mental data embodied in the Regulation is accurate. (3) The range of application of this criterion does not exceed that verified by experimental data without substantial supportive of logic. It is not the purpose of this present paper to provide an extensive review of all of the literature in the area of human head injury research. Goldsmith has provided extensive in-dÃ«pth reviews of the bio- mechanics of head injury (15, 16, 17). Patrick and co-workers (18, 19, 20) have, from time to time provided excellent discus- sions of the application of human tolerance data to protective system design. Hodgson (21) and Thomas (22) have also provided ex- tensive summaries of their particular head injury research. The HIC can only be valid (except for- tuitously) if human head injury phenomena are somehow related to (1) The linear acceleration of the cen- tre of gravity of the head of the anthropo- morphic test device (ATD) . (2) The time dependence of this linear acceleration. (3) Some critical combination of a and t which denotes the border between an in- jurious and sub-injurious situation. At the outset, it should be clear that (a) There may be nothing specially uni- que about linear acceleration. It is nothing more than a kinematic parameter and quite possibly therefore others (e.g. angular velocity, linear jerk, or even displacement) may correlate equally well or better kf , what is acknowledged to be a dynamic situation, can be correlated by kinematic parameters at all. (b) There is nothing especially unique about the centre of gravity of the ATD head. Indeed, the acceleration of any part of the ATD could in principle correlate with human head injury tolerances. (c) The sensitivity of biological sys- tems to time is an accepted, though largely unquantified principle. However, the HIC formulation extends this concept to considera- tions of exposure of a system to loading with- in prescribed limits: i.e., that time inter- val which maximizes HIC. In effect, the HIC concept purports to be able to identify a por- tion of the acceleration/ time history that would be responsible for head injury while disregarding the remainder of the history. It therefore acknowledges that the kinematic linear acceleration of the centre of gravity of the head of the ATD is the key to the prediction of human head injury, and it can furthermore select from the ATD head impact response that portion of the acceleration signal that is correlatable to human head injury. (d) The number 1,000 is an arbitrary subjective choice. It denotes the border between a "dangerous" ATD head response and a "safe" AID head response. It is clear that there are different levels of head injury severity. What would be considered an "acceptable" level of head injury in an auto- motive crash standard is a philosophical question, not to be addressed here. In addition, the HIC presupposes that a human head injury tolerance exists (somewhat like the concept of a yield strength for steel). It either disregards whatever vari- abilities there may be from human to human, or addresses some average human being. This may be quite satisfactory if the differences between humans is not large. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE HIC The origin of the head injury criterion (HIC) lies in the pioneering work of 4099</page><page sequence="3">4100 J. A. NEWMAN Gurdjian and co-workers (23, 24, 25). They developed the so-called f Wayne State University Cerebral Concussion Tolerance Curve" which has appeared throughout the literature and which provided a boundary between a "safe" head response and an "unsafe" head response. The curve was originally a plot of "effective head acceleration" versus time duration. The complete acceleration- time tolerance curve for cerebral concussion due to frontal blows was constructed by combining data from various sources. Cadaver skull fracture data anchored the short duration end of the curve below 6 milliseconds. Some clinical experi- ence (26) had shown that a moderate concus- sion usually accompanies a linear skull fracture. On that basis, it had been rationalized that for the short time duration of the curve, cadaver skull fracture would be associated with living cerebral concussion. Experimental concussion pressure- time relationships developed with dogs (23) , (it was assumed that a given intercranial pressure would inflict similar neural injury in man as in the dog) , along with head acceleration- pressure data obtained from a series of cadaver drop tests onto automobile dash panels, were used to construct the intermediate time domain of the curve up to ten milliseconds. The long duration end of the curve was completed by fairing into 40g on the basis of the accelera- tion sled rides of Stapp and other military volunteers (13) . The validity of this tolerance curve has been questioned on a number of grounds. These included: (1) The ordinate1 s "effective" acceleration was poorly defined. It is currently regarded as the time average acceleration (27). (2) The head impact data is not applicable to blows other than those to which the experi- mental animals and cadavers were subjected (24). (3) Some of the original data from which the curve was constructed was misplotted while other data points were simply omitted (28). (4) The short time duration portion of the Wayne State curve was based upon the measurement of the acceleration of a point on the skull of a cadaver head opposite the forehead blow location (29). The important point to recognize is that since the head is a deforaiable elastic system, one cannot automatically transfer acceleration data gathered from the occiput of a cadaver skull to the centre of gravity of an ATD head as to do so presupposes that the head behaves as a rigid body. (5) The Wayne State curve has never been verified for living human beings other than for the very long duration impulses by which volun- teers have been subjected to sub- injurious events . To quote Hodgson in 1972 (27): "Evidence is mounting that the entire concussion tolerance curve may not exist and that only impact against relatively stiff surfaces producing impulses with short rise time are critical". He went on to say, therefore, that: "If a head impact does not contain a critical HIC interval of less than 15 milliseconds, it should be considered safe as far as cerebral concussion is concerned". The factors described above clearly would appear to limit the applicability of the Wayne State tolerance curve. To summarize: (a) It is not clear what the acceleration measurements were. (b) The data however unclear, is applicable only to the experimental conditions under which the tests were conducted. (c) The resonance characteristics of the skull sheds considerable doubt on the validity of acceleration measurements for pulses whose contact time is less than about 10 milliseconds. (d) For pulses of longer duration (more than 15 milliseconds) the concussion aspect of the curve has been refuted by one of its prin- cipal proponents. The above discussion is by no means a thorough critique of the work which led to the Wayne State curve but is provided merely to indicate the degree to which the application of this data should be treated with care. In an effort to provide a rational and con- sistent basis for comparing the severity of various head impacts, Gadd (30) introduced the concept of a severity index (SI). The Wayne State curve was approximated by the empirical expression: a2,5 At = 1000 (1) where a was the effective acceleration and At is the time duration of the acceleration pulse. Equation 1 is a linear approximation of the Wayne State curve when plotted in logarithmic coordinates. This expression was subsequently modified to: J' a 2,5 dt = 1000 (2) At where a is the instantaneous acceleration ex- pressed as a function of time. Thivs was des- cribed as a "weighted impulse criterion". The Gadd Severity Index (SI) , thence became SI =y*a2-5dt (3) At The Severity Index was used in the first head injury standard issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in March of 1971 (31). As a result of certain objections to the Severity Index, the NHTSA rescinded its use and the SI was superceded by the Head Injury Cri- terion HIC, (32).</page><page sequence="4">HEAD INJURY CRITERIA 4101 The HIC, which was originally defined as: i ! r 2,5 (- i ! - / r adt) t = 1000 (4) A JAt was introduced in Versace's critique of the Severity Index (33). Equation 4 is simply equation 1 developed by Gadd, in which the "effective acceleration" has been replaced by the conventional average waveform level for acceleration. The integra- tion is, of course, carried out for the total duration of the acceleration pulse. Versace has pointed out, "It is possible that in an ex- tremely irregular pulse, some portion of it (HIC) could actually have a higher value than the pulse as a whole". The fact is, for virtually any pulse, the HIC will be different when evalu- ated at different time intervals. At one such interval it will be maximum. In formulating the current HIC, NHSTA apparently chose to interpret this observation as imp lying that at some time during the pulse, there may be an interval during which the average acceleration was such that the expres- sion Z2 [t -rÄf a(t)dt]2-5 CW (5) h could exceed a tolerable level (32). Hence, the final formulation for the HIC is one in which the time interval from tÄ¼ to t^ is that which maximizes the value of the expression in equation 5. It was further assumed that if this value ex- ceeds 1000, then this would constitute a "failure". Said differently, the HIC concept assures that an exposure to acceleration does not contain any time interval At that has an average accelera- tion a which is above the tolerance line, Ä 2,5 t = 1000 (1) where a is the acceleration of the centre of gravity of an ATD head as a function of time during the impact event. If it is assumed that the Wayne State toler- ance curve was in fact accurate, complete, and a valid representation of human head injury tolerance, it is of some interest to note that the data can be manipulated in certain ways. Since the WST curve is now regarded as a plot of average acceleration versus pulse duration, it can be expressed by any number of analytical expressions involving both the average accelera- tion a, and time duration t. One such approxi- mation to the Wayne State curve is not especially accurate. It will be recalled that this empirical expression was developed simply by fitting a straight line in logarithmic co- ordinates to the Wayne State curve. There is no particular reason in principle why one should attempt to fit certain data with a straight line. If, however, one insists on so doing, Versace has shown that other more accurate ex- pressions can be derived (33) . This apparent fascination with straight lines in logarithmic coordinates should in no way force the empirical function to adopt a par- ticular foim, however. As previously illustra- ted by Newman (34) , a far simpler and even more accurate approximation, in the time range of interest, is the linear expression. Ä (At + 1.5 X 10~3) = 0.7 Notwithstanding all of this, it is in fact equation 1 which forms the basis for the HIC concept . Part of this general dilemma seems to stem from the initial hypothesis that concussion, an internal head injury phenomenon, can be corre- lated with observed head movement (i.e. acceleration, velocity, displacement, etc). The fundamental question, therefore is: Can inter- nal brain injury be correlated with measured head kinematics? KINEMATIC CONSIDERATIONS Among the factors during a head impact that could influence the measured values of kinematic parameters are: (1) impact site (2) impact surface (3) impact mass (4) surrogate (i.e. AID or cadaver) mechanical features (5) instrument location (6) motion limiting features (i.e. neck) It will be recognized at this point that, with respect to any correlation between the internal dynamics of head injury and external kinematics, the HIC concept assumes that time duration and translational acceleration are the only two correlatable parameters. TIME DURATION - The role of 'time' as an independent variable in the biophysical head in- jury equation, has become a somewhat confusing issue. The confusion appears to have started with Holborne in 1943 (35). He has stated "... for blows of long duration, the injury is indepen- dent of the time for which the force acts - the injury is proportional to the acceleration". He goes on to say that "... for very short duration blows, the injury is proportional to the change of velocity of the head not the rate of change, i.e. acceleration. The changeover from one law of injury to the other occurs gradually some- where in the region of 2 msec to 20 msec". We would thus find two forms of injury criteria: a &lt; Constant for At &gt; 20 msec and aV &lt; Constant for At &lt; 2 msec</page><page sequence="5">4102 J.A.NEWMAN Since in the latter case Â¿V -Â£t adt we are left with I ^ adt = Constant J At ^ which is not unlike equation (2) and appears to place some upper limits on t (depending upon a (t) . The important point to note is that time duration At is not an independent variable. Un- like considerations of how long one may stay under water before drowning or how long one may be exposed to various levels of radiation before sustaining injury, the question is not: What is the effect on human head injury of the time duration of the impact? but rather How will the time duration of a head impact vary in response to a blow which causes a certain level of injury? That is, time duration, like acceleration and the injury itself, is an output or a res- ponse, not an input. ACCELERATION - If it is assumed that the head can be regarded to behave as a rigid body, then one can speak in terms of the movement of the head without being concerned about the move- ment of individual portions of the head. Under these conditions, if a force is directed to the head then it can be accelerated. If an impact is directed at the centre of mass of a freely moveable object (and a head which is attached to the rest of the human being is not freely moveable) the resulting motion is purely translational. If the impact is directed eccentrically, the result is a combined trans- lational and rotational acceleration. The mag- nitude of the rotational movement is related to the degree of eccentricity of the acting force and the degree to which the remainder of the human structure controls the movement of the head. This has been pointed out by Unterharnscheidt (36) . The distinction between the two types of movement is important in view of the different physical processes they initiate in the brain. "Pure translational movement creates pressure gradients while pure rotational movement produces rotation of the skull relative to the brain. Both processes are the effects of the mass inertia of the brain" (36). Correlation of internal head injury with linear parameters only, presumes that either rotational effects are negligible or that they are somehow auto- matically accounted for in the measurement of linear acceleration. There are two very distinct schools of thought on this subject. In an accidental head impact, typical of an automotive crash, one school (principally Hodgson and co-workers) supports the hypothesis that the induced injuries are related primarily to translational effects; the other school identifies rotation as the principal culprit. The chief proponents of the rotational injury hypothesis have been Qmmaya, Gennarelli, and co-workers (37, 38, 39, 40, 41). The principal methodology by which these researchers have investigated problems of rotational head move- ment has involved the constrained movement of monkeys T heads during impact. Their work continues to support the hypo- thesis espoused by Hirsch and Qmmaya (41) that: "... it is our opinion that no convincing evi- dence has to date been presented which relates brain injury and concussion to translational motion of the head for short duration force inputs...". They further state that their data emphasizes the inadequacy of current head impact tolerance criteria which relate the occurrence of brain injury to translational head motions. What is interesting about both schools is that they appear to have both taken the position that one form of acceleration or the other causes a particular type of injury.* Once again, an acceleration, be it linear or angular, is merely the response of a system to a particular force input. If damage is caused to the system, it is caused by the input. The out- put, i.e. the acceleration, may or may not re- flect the degree of damage done to the system depending on a variety of other movement con- straining factors. HEAD MOTION - Consideration of types of mo- tion and the types of injuries that may be re- lated to them would be an academic discussion if only one such movement occurred with any great frequency or severity in automobile crash situa- tions. The fact is that both types of motion do occur. Clarke, et al (42) and Portnoy, et al (43), among others, have attempted to quantify the extent of both kinds of motion. The important role that the neck plays in the eventual kinematics of the head has long been a matter of some concern. Melvin, et al (44, 45), have gone to some lengths to ensure that the neck simulators used in anthropometric test devices adequately model the data on human volunteers. Similar work by Culver, et al (46, 47) has also been conducted with the same objective of achiev- ing biokinetic fidelity. Haffner and Cohen (48) , have described similar development work for the production of anthropomorphic neck structures. Recent studies by Nusholtz, et al (49), have shown that the degree of rotational movement that a primate head will experience is very sensitive to the location of the blow. McElhaney, et al (50) in 1971, published the results of animal, cadaver, and anthropometric dummy studies in an attempt to produce injury criteria for lateral impacts to the head, thorax and abdomen. Scaling relationships for various species of animals were developed and extrapo- lated to man. These investigators found that impacts to the side of the head produced gener- ally lower levels of acceleration in comparison to those for frontal blows. * A simple analogy to the situation would be to suggest that when an automobile collides with a tree, the occupants of the car are injured because the back bumper of the car decelerates during impact .</page><page sequence="6">HEAD INJURY CRITERIA 4 1 03 The problem of determining the degree of intercranial distortion associated with a par- ticular impact, and the correlation thereof with external measurements, was addressed by the U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (51) , when in 1973 it developed a flash x-ray cinematographic method for studying intercranial vascular movement. The basic approach entailed the injection into the cranial arteries of pri- mates, a radio opaque fluid and, with the aid of a high-speed flash x-ray generator, it was possible to monitor brain movement within the cranial cavity during head impact. Shatsky, et al (52) , reported on the use of this method in an examination of head impacts to anaesthetized Maccaca monkeys. Among the more interesting results was that at any given impact velocity, the deceleration measured at the siculi vertex was numerically lower and the duration longer for side (or lateral) impacts than for impacts to the rear of the head. This, it was believed, was due to two factors: A cushioning effect of the temporalis muscle and secondly, the elasticity of the thin temporal bone compared to the thicker buttressed occipital skull. It was furthermore observed that temporoparietal im- pacts demonstrated high frequency reversible indenting of the skull while occipital impacts demonstrated no bending of the skull. In a continuing effort to address these types of problems, Got and co-workers (53) re- cently reported the results of 42 tests involv- ing direct impacts to the heads of fresh, unem- balmed cadavers. They investigated three basic types of impacts, namely that of frontal, tem- poroparietal and frontal -facial. The principal object of their work was to attempt to correlate external kinematics (i.e. HIC measurements) with different injury levels. This particular aspect of their work will be discussed in more detail later on. The important point to consider at this stage is that the nature and extent of the head injuries, as well as the head kinematics, varied significantly with the location of the impact. KINEMATIC CORRELATION It is generally recognized that the concept of either a "safe" head impact or an "unsafe" impact is an inadequate scale of measurement. Investigators in this field have thus adopted the concept of a degree or level of head injury severity with which attempts to correlate with kinematic parameters have been carried out. The usual severity scale is that of the so-called abbreviated injury scale (AIS) . The historical development of the AIS may be traced to refer- ence (54) . One of the most extensive and detailed examinations of brain injury measures and head motion parameters was undertaken by Mucciardi, et al (55). Here an analysis of experimental head impact data was performed to try to demon- strate that kinematic waveforms did contain information relating to head and brain injuries and that analysis techniques did exist that could properly exploit this information to create injury predictive functions. Their experimental data base consisted of 26 monkey head impacts which had been performed by other investigators. Trans lational and rota- tional acceleration time histories of the head were available. Parameters computed from these kinematic waveforms were the input variables to an analysis technique. The output variable was the experimentalist1 s evaluation of the severity of the injuries. The head injury severity was coded in three different forms: (1) AISq =[52 AIS.3] 1/3 the "Overall Head Injury Severity": An attempt by the authors to include multiple head injuries (56). (2) Unconsciousness AIS: A severity scale assigned to concussive injuries only. (3) Time of Unconsciousness: Recorded by visual observation of the animals T behaviour using eye-blink reflex and general muscle tone. The investigators concluded, on the basis of the 26 data banks, that indeed internal head injury could be correlated with kinematic para- meters. They found in particular that the root mean square of the translational velocity was a very informative descriptor of head injury and brain injury. The other main parameter selected by J the AIS model, in addition to the J o RMSx was the maximum x parameter. Physically these parameters were descriptive of the average and maximum momentum transferred to the animal1 s head. The results showed that greater momentum transfer contributed to high AISq values. It is important to observe that though the authors have developed a correlation between the head injury and kinematic parameters, to this point, the correlation is not with translational acceleration but rather with translational velo- city. They did find, however, that two other parameters were important for predicting Unconsciousness AIS. These were x and the maxi- mum x. These parameters, the authors claim, indicate that high average translational velocity and large maximum translational acceleration contribute to Unconsciousness AIS. Finally the authors found that the two parameters most important in predicting the Time of Unconscious- ness, were the maximum translational jerk (max x) and the ratio of maximum angular to maximum trans- lational acceleration. Consideration of this ratio showed that as more angular acceleration is induced relative to translational motion, longer times of unconsciousness resulted and these were predicted by their model. The maximum x indi- cated that high rates of change of translational acceleration also, "contributed to the duration of unconsciousness." The important thing to observe from this work is, that for a certain series of experimental head impacts to monkeys, it was shown that a cor- relation existed between the various measures of head injury and the measured kinematics of the</page><page sequence="7">4104 J.A.NEWMAN monkey head. This cannot necessarily be gener- alized to include head impacts to other primates or to man or necessarily to impact conditions beyond the range considered in these tests. It is interesting to note that in the same year that the work by Mucciardi, et al was pub- lished, Viano and Gadd (57) claimed to have shown that there is no correlation whatever between head injury and x. Further exploration of the relationships between internal brain dynamics and external head kinematics has been conducted by Stalnaker, et al (58). These authors conducted a series of head impacts on 15 unembalmed cadavers. The pur- pose of the tests was to study the application of three-dimensional motion analysis using accelerometri, brain vascular system pressuriza- tion and high-speed cineradiography to the under- standing of head injury mechanics. The authors monitored a variety of parameters including the peak force and force duration, the peak resultant linear velocity, acceleration and rate of change of acceleration as well as the peak resultant angular velocity and acceleration. They also monitored peak intercranial pressures. Attempts to correlate these parameters with the resulting AIS values were not very successful. The degree of correlation, which was admittedly very low, appeared to depend on whether the cadavers were pressurized or not prior to and during impact. In any event, because of the small number of tests, the correlations were not statistically significant. The most recent attempts to address these types of questions have been conducted by Nusholtz, et al (49). In this particular case the investigators studied the impact responses of live anaesthetized and post-mortem primates. The purpose of their project was to relate animal test results to that which had previously been conducted with cadavers. As in the case of the cadaver studies, a nine-accelerometer tech- nique was employed and a great range of kine- matic parameters was monitored. The authors concluded that this three-dimensional accelero- metry technique could be applied to direct head impacts with lower primate subjects. They found, however, that a moving field of reference may be more promising in describing head impact motion than the Cartesian coordinate system presently employed. They further felt that reparameteri- zation of head impact motion events could prove useful in describing similarities and differ- ences between the head impact response of human surrogates. They have observed also that the response of the head during and after the time of contact is affected by the soft tissue of the head and neck. Furthermore, they have found that live and post mortem (unpressurized) sub- primate test subjects showed different responses in terms of both head kinematics and epidural pressure. Differences between human beings has only recently been considered to be a major factor in automotive crash analysis though significant differences have been documented in the past (59 for example). Searle, et al (60) has shown in 1978 that many road accident injuries occur in "fairly low speed accidents to weaker (sic) members of the population". They have indicated further that "some information is available on the distribution of tolerance levels among the population". They do not attempt to identify or categorize the "weaker" members of the human race. A most recent study by Mattern, et al (61) , has provided some very important information in this connection. Through the use of multiple regression analysis on the results of 212 belted cadavers exposed to frontal collisions, it was found that the age of the subject had a 4.3 times greater influence on the resulting AISq than did collision velocity. For example, the overall AIS for a twenty year old would increase from 1, to 1.5 in the speed range 30 to 65 km/h. A 60 year old would sustain injuries from 2.8 to 3.3 in the same speed range. Though other factors; general level of health, physical condition, diet, genetic traits etc. could also be expected to have a bearing on injury tolerance, this study is the first to quantify (in a statistical sense) the major in- fluence of age. Data such as reported above, lends credence to the idea that variabilities between human beings may be so great as to pre- clude ever defining an absolute head injury tolerance level. Beyond this, it is apparent that any one individual will have different levels of tolerance to head impact depending on not only impact object characteristics, but also on impact site. In a recent study of acceleration- induced shear strains in a monkey brain hemi- section, Hodgson and Thomas (62) have shown that markedly different types of intercranial damage can occur under different combinations of translational and rotational movement but that in all cases a similar HIC would be recorded. Notwithstanding this, Hodgson has suggested that linear indices, ". ..are based upon accelerometer measurements which reflect at least some degree of the in- tensity of both translation and rotation by picking up components of both". Therefore, they claim, their results serve to both justify continued use of linear indices in estimating the degree of trauma indicated by an instrumen- ted human surrogate at the same time pointing out possible shortcomings. Though it is not perfectly evident at this time, it appears that unless conditions are highly controlled, it is very unlikely that head injury severity can be adequately pre- dicted for human beings in automotive crash situations on the basis of head kinematics alone: Certainly not on the basis of transla- tional head acceleration alone. And certainly not, therefore, on the basis of a function which invokes translational acceleration alone (i.e. HIC). To summarize to this point it is clear that: (a) Attempts to correlate internal brain injury with measured head kinematics have been</page><page sequence="8">HEAD INJURY CRITERIA 4105 largely unsuccessful. In some highly controlled experiments, certain correlations have been developed. These bear heavily however, on kinematic parameters other than translational acceleration. (b) The Wayne State tolerance curve is alleged to represent the boundary between tolerable and intolerable head impact responses. In light of the wide variation in degree and extent of head injury that can occur, such a well defined boundary is inappropriate. (c) Kinematic, dynamic, and physiological response of the head depends greatly on the precise impact site and upon the impacting medium . (d) Attempts to correlate the measured response of cadavers to that of live subjects have not been successful. (e) Variations between different human beings probably are greater than the alleged variability proposed by the Wayne State toler- ance curve concept. In spite of all these confounding factors, there still remains the issue of the anthropo- metric test device which is used in automotive crash testing and the degree to which it can be expected to faithfully reproduce either the physical or kinematic response of a human being. ANTHR0P0M0RPHI C TEST DEVICES It cannot be overlooked that any ATD cannot be injured or killed. If human-based injury criteria are to be employed, the ATD must res- pond in a human- like manner to the required im- pact variables. It has been assumed to date that human- like means; looks like a human and, when forced to move, moves like a human (i.e. a geometric and kinematic replica) . Until re- cently, dynamic similiarity has not been con- sidered. The use of inanimate, mechanical surrogates (i.e. dummies) in the evaluation of human pro- tective systems is a complex medical, engineer- ing and philosophical subject. The fundamental tenet of any discussion on the subject is: The likelihood of injury to a human being can be assessed using a surrogate than cannot be injured. Philosophical questions aside, there still are numerous practical "dummy" problems in occu- pant impact protection evaluation. Patrick (63) in 1973, pointed out, quite rightly, that "a comparison of the dynamic response of humans and dummies is an ambiguous task. The inference is that a simple comparison with the finite number of quantitative values available for comparison is possible. In fact, it consists of comparing a finite number of variables with an infinite number". Any dummy, he pointed out, has a fixed measureable force and/or kinematic behaviour. The individual human, on the other hand, has a far greater number of parts that are connected by tissues of infinite adjustability. And, "There will always be only a relatively few dummies available, while the variety of humans is endless with new variations being produced daily". His principal conclusions at that time, which are repeated below, are only slightly less accurate today than they were then: (1) There is a paucity of data available for accurately comparing the dynamic response of humans and dummies. (2) The rapid changes taking place in dummy design make comparisons of dynamic response of the dummy and human of limited value. (3) Current dummies often show short dura- tion, high amplitude acceleration or force peaks on transducer records during impact that are not present in comparable human exposures. (4) More complete instrumentation is re- quired to compare the human and dummy response. BRIEF HISTORICAL REVIEW - It is beyond the scope of this paper to review in detail the his- tory of ATD development. However a few his- torical milestones should be mentioned. Stapp, a pioneer in the field of biomechani- cal impact trauma research, provided early encouragement for development of ATD?s (64). "Once the long and difficult task has been accomplished of identifying the spectrum of in- jury criteria by experiments on anesthetized animals and cadavers and by autopsies of acci- dental exposures, particularly of measured high falls, correlation with corresponding measure- ments on anthropometric dummies is possible". Nine years later, it appears that the "long and difficult task" may not be over. The first generation of test dummies was originally developed for the U.S. Air Force to test pilot seat emergency ejection. The head for this type of test device had no important test function. Early adaptations to meet auto- motive needs led to a second generation of an- thropomorphic test device. By 1970, the Sierra Engineering Company, one of the early developers of test dummies, had refined the design of the test device to a point where it could "simulate the basic human body components in sizes, shape, mass and kinematics" (65). This ATD had a completely new head design, the skull of which was covered with a removable skin. A newly-developed neck produced a more "human-like" response. A new shoulder assembly featured "better contour and muscle tone" and the chest of previous generation dummies was re- placed with a plastic contoured rib cage of the "required load deflection characteristics". Concurrent with the work by Sierra, the Alderson Company was developing its own dummies. Analysis of the response of an Alderson dummy was carried out by Sprouffske, et al (66). This early work illustrated the importance of the adjustment of the joints of the dummy and of the nature of the bearing surfaces for the dummy in determining its eventual kinematic behaviour during sled tests. The whole issue of the repeatability of dummy performance, and its sensitivity to minor variations in initial test conditions, became a subject of exhaustive research in the early 1970Ås. McAdams (67), examined the performance</page><page sequence="9">4106 J.A.NEWMAN differences due to variabilities of a particular dummy, dummy to dummy variability of two or more dummies of the same manufacturer, and vari- ability from one make of dummy to another. In his study both Sierra and Alderson devices were examined. He determined that a substantial lack of repeatability in dummy response could arise either because of differences in the response characteristics of the dummy or because of the difference in the test environment. In some testing situations, minor variations in test control could induce sizeable changes in output response; for other situations the response would be relatively insensitive to lack of test control. He indicated, in addition, that further study was required to properly relate the role of variation in dummy response function to variation in input stimuli, as these combine to produce variation in the output response of the dummies. In the early 1970' s the automotive companies themselves became much more involved in the development of anthropometric test devices. Daniel, et al (68) of the Ford Motor Company, worked extensively on the development of the so-called Hybrid II Dummy.* By 1974, the Hybrid II was superceded by the Part 572 ATD and though all the progression from Hybrid I through its successors, produced signi- ficant improvements, it was apparent by 1976, that additional hardware improvements and new design concepts were in order. In general, defi- ciencies were related to either a lack of bio- mechanical response, or that existing dummies were deficient in design intent. In 1977, Massing reported on a performance evaluation of three of the advanced 50 percen- tile male anthropomorphic test dummies (69) . Dummies produced by the Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) , General Motors and Sierra were examined. Statistical analyses of replicate measurements of dummy accelerations and res- traint system loads taken in four sled test en- vironments simulating typical belt, air bag and vehicle interior configurations revealed the following: (1) the degree of response repeatability of a particular dummy is both test- configuration and measured- variable dependent. (2) the means of certain responses of a pair of identically manufactured dummies were significantly different, while the variances of the respective means were statistically similar. (3) no one dummy design demonstrated best repeatability characteristics across all test configurations and measured- response variables. During the same period, Foster, et al (70) reported on the development at General Motors of the Hybrid III ATD. This model reflects the state-of-art of ATD technology though it too is acknowledged not to be without its shortcomings. Investigators in Europe during the 1970' s were also very much involved in test dummy development. Gersbach and Mus seier in Germany * The Hybrid II succeeded the Hybrid I which in turn was a modified Sierra design. (71), undertook a study of the Hybrid II dummy with a view to examining among other things, the influence of the neck stiffness on the dummy head kinematics and on the resultant HIC. They found, as might be expected, that the gross kinematic movement of the dummy head was highly dependent on the geometric and structural char- acteristics of the particular neck that was used Different necks resulted in different degrees of neck flexion and head rotation. This would con- tribute differently to the extent of linear and rotational acceleration experienced by the head at impact as well as vary the impact site on the head. Perhaps more importantly they found that the HÄªC had a very strong apparent dependence on the neck stiffness characteristics. It is not clear however that such differences are related to different human neck structures. One cannot infer from this work that a stiff muscular neck would have more or less of an effect on head injury than a "weak" fragile neck. Other interesting work pertaining to dummy sensitivity has been conducted by Seiffert and Leyer (72), who examined the temperature denen - dence of the dummy. The object of their work was to ascertain the degree to which variations in environmental temperature could influence the kinematic response of the dummy. They found different and more exaggerated kinematic motion for heated dummies and predictable significant influence of temperature on dummy components. They found further that linear indices (HIC and SI) increased markedly with environmental temperature . In France, Dejeammes and Quincy (73) con- ducted a study of the efficiency of three point belts and air bags in a subcompact vehicle. In conducting their analysis, these investigators concluded that their "...tests indicate the great influence of the dummy on the assessment of restraint efficiency. This difference is all the more difficult to analyse as it also depends on the type of restraint used. In the case of three point belt, the mechanical characteristics such as thorax rigidity and articulations, induce differences". In their work they used both an Alderson 50 percentile dummy and the European ONSER test dummy. In the United Kingdom, work on ATD 's was underway (74) and international cooperation was evident by 1977. In a joint effort between TRRL and Leyland Cars of the United Kingdom and the AB Volvo Car Division of Sweden, 0' Cornell and Almqvist (75), undertook a survey of the quality of Hybrid II dummies produced by different manu- facturers. Their program, conducted at two different test facilities, consisted of a series of nominally identical system sled tests. On the basis of their work a deviation as much as 30% could be ascribed to the important injury criteria measurements. In 1979, Alderson (76) described a "new con- cept in anthropomorphic test dummies for lateral impact". The purpose of this particular develop- ment, according to the author, was to refine further these test devices in- order that the</page><page sequence="10">HEAD INJURY CRITERIA 4107 response of the dummy to lateral loading be more "realistic". This new concept was based upon the substitution of rubber shoulders for the rigid, articulated mechanical linkages which constitute the skeletal structures of present dummies. The concept also included the use of plastic bones and energy absorbing flesh sec- tions in the upper arms. Work of similar intent in France has recently been described by Stalnaker, et al (77). Lowne, et al of TRRL in England (78) , have recently suggested that there is a need for a dummy capable of measuring impact forces directly in side impact testing; as opposed to merely monitoring kinematic variables. They have suggested that the types of injuries ob- served in side impact crashes are characteristic of forces rather than accelerations, i.e. serious injuries are caused by local forces to the torso and by crushing of the pelvis. As such, these do not constitute inertial loading and therefore acceleration (or presumably any other kinematic parameter) is not the variable of concern. Rather, the dynamic parameter, force, should be measured. To summarize the development of anthropo- morphic test devices, it can probably be suggested at this time that: (1) The apparent performance of any auto- motive restraint system is highly dependent on the particular mechanical details of the ATD that is used in the evaluation. (2) Attempts to replicate human kinematics in a crash situation have been based largely on observations made with cadavers. Most evidence suggests that living and dead bodies will be- have very differently. (3) They are based on incomplete bio- mechanical data. (4) An ATD could, at best, only simulate one particular human being under one particular prescribed set of conditions. (5) There is growing evidence that attempts to model the human system during impact loading, may have been unsuccessful because the wrong modelling parameters (i.e. kinematics) have been used. Insofar as head injury has been one of the principal concerns in occupant crash protection, it is not surprising that a great deal of effort has been expended on the development of ATD head models. By 1970, a variety of mechanical headforms were being employed to test the crashworthiness of vehicle interiors and the effectiveness of helmets.' Most of these were, and to a large extent still are, of metal construction. Many investigators have maintained that to effectively assess head injury potential, a "realistic" surrogate headform must be used. In this connection, Melvin, et al (79) and Gadd, et al (80) among others, studied the mechanical and physical properties of soft tissue (i.e. scalp, dura and brain matter) and bone (especially skull bones) . Concurrently the development of synthetic substitutes (81, 82) and tissue failure models (81, 83) was pursued. Among the first to consider the importance of properly modelling the human head with a test device were Slattenscheck and co-workers (84) . At that time, their particular concern was with the evaluation of the safety characteristics of automotive windshields. In order to make such assessments, they developed their "phantom head". In developing this device they had made a con- scientious effort to take into account the problems associated with the mechanical response (i.e. skull vibration) observed in Hodgson* s initial studies (29) . Hodgson in 1972 (85) , and later in 1973 (86), reported on the developmental work at Wayne State University of an anthropomorphic headform. Relying largely on their own experi- ence with cadavers, Hodgson and co-workers did indeed develop probably the first head model that had biokinetic fidelity. This particular headform has not been used in automotive crash test work but it is used in football helmet impact evaluation studies (87). One of its "limitations" is that like the human head, it will fracture under excessive local loading. The consequences of this in crash testing is obvious . Much of the early work on anthropomorphic headform development was limited by inadequate geometric and structural data on human heads. Not until Becker in 1972 (88) , undertook a study of head mass distribution and various anatomical parameters, and Walker (89) in 1973 studied mass, volume and centre of gravity (as well as moment of inertia characteristics) of the head, did further development work have greater assurance of being "realistic". Slattenscheck, et al (90) , even as late as 1974, were still using their "phantom head" for windshield evaluation. They chose to determine the "safety characteristics" of different types of windshields on the basis of certain injury criteria. Among these was the HIC. Hubbard and McLeod (91, 92), have summarized their work at General Motors on crash dummy heads to 1974. In order to achieve biofidelity, the authors relied on peak centre of gravity acceleration measurements of Hodgson and Thomas (93). Since 1974, very little further develop- mental work on ATD heads has been reported. In 1976, Saczalksij et al (94), and Webster and Newman (95) , reiterated the concern with respect to the use of non-human responding surrogates for safety system evaluation and have re- emphasized the great difficulty in the applica- tion of alleged biomechanical tolerance limits to artificial or "non-humanlike" headform surro- gates . To summarize to this point; ATD head models have been developed using the best data avail- able. However it has generally been assumed that if one can approach a human- like kinematic response, then internal head injury assessment is possible. Consequently, though some surro- gates have "brains", they generally cannot be</page><page sequence="11">4108 J. A. NEWMAN subjected to internal phenomena measurement. No actual test devices have yet been developed which would allow such measurements in automo- tive crash testing. Thus, investigators have continued to measure ATD head kinematics only with the belief that such measurements do correlate to internal head phenomena. Yet, windshield safety evaluation, for example, abounds with inconsistencies that linear kine- matic indices can be used to predict head impact injury likelihood (96, 97, 98, 99, 100). The point is, linear acceleration; SI and HIC have been assumed to be reasonable para- meters with which to evaluate head injury pro- bability. The assumption can only be reason- able if no evidence can be presented to show otherwise. The following section addresses those particular studies that either directly or indirectly, provide that evidence regarding HIC. HIC/AIS CORRELATION STUDIES One of the first and most extensive attempts to validate HIC, was conducted by Patrick (101) in 1974. In that study, 48 actual frontal GM car crashes involving 65 occupants were studied. Injury data and vehicle deformation were docu- mented and simulation tests were conducted on an impact sled using a Sierra fifty percentile ATD. By comparing actual occupant head injury to recorded accelerometer data under simulated crash conditions, two correlations were devel- oped, one for the driver, one for a right front passenger. These were driver HÄªC = 69.5 + 104.8 AIS + 30.46 (AIS)2 r.f . pass HIC = 109 + 58.8 AIS +6.2 (AIS)2 One important point to note here is that the above result does not suggest that driver and passenger occupy areas of different hazard levels (though they do) but rather that a passen- ger has an inherently different tolerance to head injury by virtue solely of being a passen- ger.* This is as irreconcilable as saying that a low carbon steel has a different yield point if you use it to build a bridge than if you use it to build a ship. Later that same year, Patrick, et al (102) reported on 72 simulations of actual Volvo accidents involving fully-belted occupants. In this study 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile dummies were used. (Only one actual accident- induced head injury above AIS 2 was reported) . On the basis of the simulated crashes; "Head injury is not a major problem at velocities up to 53 mph BEV (barrier equivalent velocity) at which the HIC is 3130". One is thus inclined to conclude that human tolerance is higher in a Volvo than in a GM car. He may or may not be safer, but it is illogical to suggest, as this result does, that he is more injury resistant. Most recently, Nyquist, et al (103) using * e.g. passenger will sustain AIS 3 at HIC = 347; dirver sustains AIS 3 at HIC = 1082 the same Volvo data base, have conducted a series of replication tests using a Hybrid III ATD and WHAM III sled- vehicle combination impact facility. Following a cleansing of the data (to exclude child occupants, improperly belted occupants, cases with injuries resulting only from occupant impacts to the vehicle interior, etc.), the authors have concluded that: "in the absence of direct head impact, ....head HIC of 1640. .. .appear (s) to be essentially non- injurious". This, on the basis of 22 cases of AIS = 0 with a corresponding HIC of 1640 and one case of AIS = 1 with a corresponding HIC of 154. Cesari and Ramet in 1975 (104) , and again in 1979 (105) , also reported on some replication work. They took known actual car crash data (from on-site investigations) along with actual recorded head injuries to the occupant victims and reconstructed precisely the same collision using identical vehicles to those in the real accident. Each simulation was conducted twice; once with ATD1 s and once with human cadavers. The dummies and cadavers were instrumented and calculated HIC's were compared to the head injuries of the human counterparts. They assumed that HIC was valid and concluded that "An AIS 3 head injury in a real accident can be associated with a lower value than 500 HIC value recorded on a part 572 (ATD) dummy". In 1976, Lowne and Wall (106) of TRRL in the United Kingdom have described similar attempts to correlate injury information obtained in accident investigations with laboratory tests using the OPAT dummy. Their findings, with respect to head injury, were not clear, as there was only one instance of brain injury in their accident sample. Exactly the same type of reconstruction has recently been carried out by the Langweider, et al (107) . Using a standard Sierra dummy in crash tests and sled ^uns, they have correlated head injury AIS with measured HIC. They too have assumed HIC to be valid and concluded that: "The tolerance limit for fatal head injuries was found at about HIC = 1600 and is therefore higher than it is assumed ud to the present". Automobile occupants are obviously not the only victims of accidental head injury. Kramer (108), among others, has simulated pedestrian accidents with dummies and has actually made recommendations for vehicle front and design on the basis of observed HIC's. Foust, et al (109) in 1977, and Mohan, et al in 1979 (110) have, using mathematical recon- struction models, simulated accidental free falls of human beings. They have found that an AIS 5 head injury corresponds to a HIC of "approximately" 11,000, and "conservative HIC limit for a AIS 2 must be substantially less than 3,000". Instead of attempting to correlate measured (or calculated) linear indices with actual AIS, another approach has been to correlate such indices (measured on cadavers) with the actual (interpreted) injuries to the same cadavers. Got, et al (53) have been especially active in</page><page sequence="12">HEAD INJURY CRITERIA 4109 this area. Their most recent conclusions in this regard are as follows: n3. Research for the correlation between A.I.S. and H.I.C. has met with a variety of difficulties. - Firstly, individual tolerances are very scattered. - Secondly, the type of variables raises special problems due to definition of A.I.S. by a figure, approximate determination of gravity of injuries, mathematical definition of H. I .C. , etc. - Finally, the analysis that would provide a means of separating the influence of various parameters available after experiments has not yet started. 4. It has nevertheless been possible to set a threshold for the appearance of severe injuries during temporoparietal impacts without fractures because no grave injuries have been found in this type of impact - beneath an H.I.C. value of about 1500. It should be noted that this threshold at which injuries appear is different from the "tolerance level", this last magnitude is necessarily higher". In arriving at these conclusions, they have analysed not only their own data, but also that of Stalnaker, et al (58) and Nahum, et al (99, 111) . Interestingly, in their most recent work on intercranial dynamics, Nahum and co-workers (112) , though continuing to monitor and record HIC on cadavers, have not attempted to correlate observed injury levels to HIC. Rather they are seeking correlations between internal pressure measurements and head injury level. To summarize, the actual HIC/AIS data of Patrick (101), Cesari and Ramet (104, 105), Landweider, et al (107), Mohan, et al (110), Got, et al (53), Stalnaker, et al (58), and Nahum, et al (99, 111) are presented in Figure 1. There is no reason to believe that any of these studies have been poorly conducted or that the authors are less than honest when presenting their data. This being assumed, there is only one inescapable conclusion. Head injury severity and HIC do not correlate. * CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS This study has questioned the fundamental basis of the Head Injury Criterion, HIC. Based upon the evidence reviewed herein, it is con- cluded that: The use of the HIC in automotive crash test- ing is fundamentally wrong. It is incapable of predicting from ATD kinematics, the likelihood or severity of human head injury. It is in error because: (1) The Wayne State University data from which the HIC is derived, provides no informa- tion regarding the functional relationships between human head injury, cadaver and ATD head acceleration and time. (2) The empirical approximation to the * A least squares linear regression approxima- tion to the data in Figure 1 yields the straight line AIS = .00053 HIC + 1.33. The correlation coefficient is r = 0.393. This is regarded as low correlation. 6 1 - â  1 â¦ I I I I I I I I 5Â« i â  a mm i â¢ * m I / ! o I cm i [ 4&lt; Im i I Ã­?

Data from various sources</page><page sequence="13">4110 J.A.NEWMAN Wayne State curve is in error. (3) The HIC considers linear kinematics only when no general relationship between head kinematics of either kind (linear or rotational) and head injury has been shown. In addition to these fundamental errors in logic, head impact assessment by crash simula- tion with present-day ATDs is of limited value because : (4) ATDs have been designed and constructed to model human geometry and kinematics only. No serious attempts, until recently, have addressed ATD head dynamics and no current ATD provides the capability of monitoring meaningful inter- cranial phenomena. (5) Current ATDs behave, kinematically, only approximately like cadavers. (6) Cadavers behave, kinematically, only approximately, like living human beings. (7) Different human beings, cadavers and ATDs will each behave somewhat differently for the same impact. Notwithstanding the limitations of current ATDs, there are a number of approaches perhaps worthy of consideration. In order of increasing sophistication these are: (a) Revise the test procedures and failure criteria to preclude ATD head contact with any part of the automobile. This will provide some assurances that head impact trauma is unlikely. This general approach has been suggested in 1975 by Adomeit (113) in his study on "motion sequence criteria" and again in 1977 (114). This particular approach to the problem has the advantage that it does not invoke any human-based injury criteria. However to provide assurances that head injury would be unlikely in real car crashes (where head contact would re- main a real possibility if the severity of the actual crash was greater than that of the test) , certain load- deformation characteristics (e.g. padding) of contact surfaces could be specified. This latter can be accomplished from fundamental engineering mechanics and could be largely in- dependent of precise biomechanical limits. (b) An alternate approach would be to per- mit head contact but to limit the impact speed of the AID head. Since, all else being equal, the slower one strikes his head, the less likely is a head injury, this approach, combined with contact surface requirements, may have merit. In its simplest form, this approach can be em- ployed today. Direct integration of the ATD head acceleration just prior to impact is within the scope of current instrumentation technology. Ideally, however, one would wish to correlate the actual velocity vector with the impact site so that both normal and tangential velocity components could be derived. This would provide insight into the relative contributions to line- ar and rotational head injury, and arbitrary limits could be placed on each. (c) A third approach would be to monitor the force developed on the ATD head during im- pact. All else being equal, the lower this force the better. (Warner and Niven (115) have just recently described some preliminary work on headforms to permit force measurements directly) . This method obviates the need for material specifications as the force developed would be a function of the load- deformation characteristics of the contact surfaces. With- out invoking human-based data, one could set an arbitrary (low) value for the peak force. At present, instrumentation to make such measure- ments has not been available. Ideally, one would wish to monitor the force tensor (i.e. vectorial components and location on the head) in order to assess the relative importance of compressive and shear loading and the different tolerances to head trauma associated with different impact sites. (d) A refinement of the above would be to monitor actual force spatial distribution (i.e. local skull external pressure) . Criteria could be established on this basis to assess directly skull fracture likelihood. Unfortunately instrumentation does not exist at this time that would permit these measurements. Furthermore, far more consideration would have to be given to the force -deflection charac- teristics of the ATD head. At present only qualitative skull fracture criteria could be employed, as actual ATD heads are considerably stiffer (and stronger) than human heads (except for some special cases) . (e) Another approach to the problem would be to design an AIT) head having the appropriate skull deflection characteristics and an artifi- cial brain. Hodgson's headform (85) came very close to meeting these demands but, as has already been discussed, it is not directly suitable for automotive crash test work. Such a headform could be fitted with internal pressure transducers and induced pressure transients could be monitored. Instrumentation exists, the ATD head does not. As the work of Nahum, et al (111, 112) continues, correlation between head injury and intercranial pressure measurements are to be anticipated. These criteria could be applied directly to the ATD head in an automo- tive crash test. It is this writer's opinion that any of the above approaches holds far more promise for assessing head injury likelihood in automobiles than the present HIC.
