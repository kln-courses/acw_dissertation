<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANDREW HAZUCHA Neither Deep nor Shallow but National Eco-Nationalism in Wordsworth's Guide to the Lakes As my object is to reconcile a Briton to the scenery of his own coun- try , though not at the expense of truth, I am not afraid of asserting that in many points of view our Lakes , also , are much more interest- ing than those of the Alps . . . - Wordsworth, A Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of England, 18221 I. Contemporary ecocritics may derive satisfaction from the fact that after thirty years of radically revisionist Wordsworth criticism the pendulum has swung back their way: Wordsworth is, yet again, a nature poet. Wordsworth's reputation as a naturalist writer began to suffer most seriously in the 1980s, when such respected critics as James Averill, Geoffrey Hartman, and Alan Liu began to construct the poet variously as a humanist, an Enlightenment thinker, or an ex-revolutionary guilty of political apostasy.2 Recent studies over the last decade, however, have reexamined Wordsworth's relation- ship to the natural world in light of the environmental movement, seeing his poetry as antecedent to contemporary ways of looking at the environment. Jonathan Bate, for example, presents a strenu- ous argument for a green reading of Wordsworth, asserting that Wordsworth is a central figure in "a tradition of environmental con- Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 9.2 (Summer 2002) Copyright © 2002 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">62 ISLE sciousness" ( Romantic 9). 3 Karl Kroeber, Paul Fry, and Michael Kohler have all added to Bate's claims with new evidence of the ways in which Wordsworth cultivates an environmental ethic in his poetry. Today the debate is not so much whether Wordsworth is a pioneering environmentalist as whether he is a "deep" or "shal- low" ecologist. Was Wordsworth, as Bate argues, interested prima- rily in "enabling] his readers to enjoy life ... by teaching them to look at and dwell in the natural world" (4)? Or does his poetry more stridently critique the anthropomorphic position that falsely sets man apart from nature? The easy way to answer this question is to argue that Wordsworth is both shallow and deep in different poems and at different stages of his poetic career. My intention, however, is to complicate this dialectic with an examination of his prose, for it is Wordsworth's prose writ- ings that most fully and clearly articulate many of the social concerns that drive his poetry. The evidence from Wordsworth's later career suggests that he became increasingly isolationist and nationalistic in some of his prose works, a development that coincided with his grow- ing concern about the threats to the ecological health of the Lake Dis- trict where he lived. His two letters protesting the Kendal-to- Windermere railway, for instance, which appeared in the Morning Post in December 1844, offer a surprising counterpoise to his earlier claims of an egalitarian politics.4 They give voice in the last decade of his life to his yearnings for a natural refuge undisturbed by commoners, a desire also articulated in his late sonnets, "On the Projected Kendal and Windermere Railway" and "Proud Were Ye, Mountains, When, in Times of Old." Another much-neglected but crucial text that ought to be of par- ticular concern to modern environmentalists is Wordsworth's A Guide through the District of the Lakes , a long prose piece that he re- vised through five separate editions over a twenty-five-year pe- riod from 1810-1835. Upon reading all five editions of the Guide consecutively, one learns that over time Wordsworth became in- creasingly alarmed over the effects of tourism in the Lake District, especially the environmental damage wrought by wealthy tourists who, in the beginning of the nineteenth century, began buying up land and importing non-native plant species that Wordsworth iden- tified as problematic - often ornamental trees such as copper beeches and rhododendrons, or timber trees such as the larch - into the ecosystem for landscaping. Indeed, Wordsworth's revisions to the Guide bespeak an increasingly alarmist attention to ecological matters and suggest quite strongly that we may consider him the first true English ecocritic. By examining the history of those revi-</page><page sequence="3">Neither Deep nor Shallow but National 63 sions, we see that Wordsworth consciously crafted his Guide as an environmental text and wished to inculcate an ecological reading of it. Even more interesting, perhaps, is the stridently nationalistic tone that Wordsworth struck in his Guide even as he urged his readers to preserve the Lake District from the "rash assault" of his own country- men. It would behoove the ecocritic, then, to examine Wordsworth's evolving environmental aesthetic against the backdrop of his direc- tive to his readers to conceptualize the mountains of the Lake District as national treasures far surpassing in beauty and value any analo- gous natural formation in Europe. For Wordsworth, the Lake District bioregion - which he construed as subtle, nuanced, and a harmonious blend of diverse features - was the perfect metaphor for the English national character. Moreover, his subtle linking of foreigners with non- native plant species, and his distaste for both, suggest how thoroughly Wordsworth's nationalistic temper suffused his aesthetic pronounce- ments about the Lake District's natural charms. II. Wordsworth's preoccupation with the environmental effects of tour- ism in the eastern corridor of the Lake District is based on his be- lief - which he fiercely maintained for the last forty years of his life - that new landowners attracted to the Lake District's charms should use only native building materials to erect their houses and only native flora to landscape their property. As early as 1810, when the amateur artist Joseph Wilkinson first convinced him to write the accompanying text for a pictorial guide to the Lakes entitled Select Views in Cumberland, Westmoreland , and Lancashire , a text he was later to augment and rename as the Guide , Wordsworth exhib- ited much anxiety over the increasing number of violations to his two principles. Noting that the vale of Grasmere had been undis- turbed for centuries until Thomas Gray, Thomas West, and Dr. John Brown all popularized the English Lakes in the late eighteenth cen- tury with their personal accounts of tours to the region, Wordsworth in Select Views (in a passage that remained unchanged in each suc- ceeding edition of the Guide) argues that the growing trend among new settlers is to landscape their property with ornamental gar- dens comprised of exotics. "Other trees," laments Wordsworth, as he describes the woods typically found in the Lake District, "have been introduced within the last fifty years, such as beeches, larches, limes, &amp;c., and plantations of firs, seldom with advantage, and of- ten with great injury to the appearance of the country" ( Guide 44).</page><page sequence="4">64 ISLE To Wordsworth the introduction of non-native plants into the re- gion violated both good taste and sound environmental policy, and it is this latter concern - an interest in preserving the ecology of the Lake District by maintaining the native flora there - that Wordsworth developed and expanded throughout his several edi- tions of the Guide. In the third section of Select Views , entitled "Changes, and Rules of Taste for Preventing Their Bad Effects," Wordsworth points out that Lake Windermere and its environs once formed a series of "kindred mountain retirements" which, because of their remote location, re- mained "consecrated from profanation." With the publishing successes of Gray's "Journal" (1775), West's Guide (1778), and Brown's Descrip- tion (1767), however, Wordsworth argues that Windermere and the other Lakes have since suffered unforeseen consequences from in- creased tourism. "The lakes," he writes, "had now become celebrated; visitors flocked hither from all parts of England; the fancies of some were smitten so deeply, that they became settlers; and numerous vio- lations soon ensued" ( Select xxii). This rather general assessment of the damage done to the area becomes more specific in the second edi- tion of the Guide - published ten years later in 1820 - where Wordsworth deletes the concluding phrase "and numerous violations soon ensued" in favor of "and the islands of Derwentwater and Winandermere, as they offered the strongest temptation, were the first places seized upon, and were instantly defaced by the intrusion" ( To- pographical 274). The reader of the 1820 version of the Guide subse- quently learns that the "defacement" Wordsworth mentions refers primarily to the alteration of existing flora, for a few paragraphs later he has added a diatribe against the widespread eradication of native oak forests, a practice that is becoming increasingly common to make way for plantations of what Wordsworth calls "Scotch firs." The Scotch fir, known to modern botanists as the Scots pine, is a conifer which today is found primarily in the Scottish highlands but which was planted for timber throughout the Lake District in the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries. Like the larch, another non-native conifer grown for timber in Wordsworth's day, the Scots pine was also a popular tree for private landscaping. It is now a relatively rare spe- cies in the north of England, due in large part to such broadleaved species as the beech outcompeting it in the ecosystem (Soutar and Peterken 14; Taylor). Wordsworth disliked the Scots pine on the premise that it was an ugly usurper placed there by artifice; in the 1820 edition of the Guide he describes seeing a grove of oak trees "felled by its na- tive proprietor, and the whole island planted anew with Scotch firs, left to spindle up by each other's side - a melancholy phalanx, defy-</page><page sequence="5">Neither Deep nor Shallow but National 65 ing the power of the winds, and disregarding the regret of the specta- tor" ( Topographical 275). Wordsworth's principal complaint, then, seems derived from a decidedly aesthetic judgment that the stands of Scots pines are unnatural pockmarks on the landscape. At the center of his attempts to define what is natural and unnatural, however, is the no- tion that man-made plantations of trees disrupt the intrinsic order or- dained by nature. That Wordsworth had long thought about this ques- tion from an ecological perspective is borne out by his insistence as early as 1810 that the landscaper must "work ... in the spirit of Na- ture, with an invisible hand of art. Planting, and a removal of wood, may thus, and thus only, be carried on with good effect" ( Guide 74). For Wordsworth, working "in the spirit of nature" meant giving prior- ity to native or local trees when planting new wood, because he be- lieved that these species would maintain the natural order hitherto established in the local ecosystem. By the same reasoning, introduc- ing non-native species would threaten to subvert that order. Wordsworth's aversion to non-native species is nowhere more stri- dent than in his repeated discussions of the larch tree, which he first included in the 1810 Select Views and which he never altered through- out the four successive editions of the Guide. Although not native to the Lake District, larch trees had been common to southern England and the continent for centuries. Because the larch is a fast-growing tree that regenerates very rapidly on its own, settlers to the Lake Dis- trict planted it for timber, and by the early nineteenth century larches had effectively taken over large tracts of land there (Taylor). Wordsworth first objects to the larch in the third section of the 1810 Select Views , where he says, "To those who plant for profit, and are thrusting every other tree out of the way, to make room for their favourite, the larch, I would first utter a regret, that they should have selected these lovely vales for their vegetable manufactory" (xxviii). Implicit in Wordsworth's use of the term "vegetable manufactory" is the view that such trees are artificially placed in an environment that would not otherwise produce them under naturally occurring condi- tions. Wordsworth formulates this thought more fully in subsequent paragraphs, arguing that in the natural world forests are formed by the indiscriminate scattering of seeds by wind, water, and birds. The result of this process, he says, is a tree that "grows, sometimes single, taking its own shape without constraint, but for the most part com- pelled to conform itself to some law imposed upon it by its neighbours" (Guide 85). By contrast, the artificial planter "must generally start all [his trees] at the same time; and this necessity would of itself prevent that fine connexion of parts, that sympathy and organization . . . which pervades the whole of a natural wood" (86). When one begins to plant</page><page sequence="6">66 ISLE trees in numbers, Wordsworth warns, one begins to lose the sym- pathetic relationships between species and thereby violates the natural order. Wordsworth provides evidence for his argument by pointing out for his reader the "large tracts of larch-plantations that are overrun- ning the hill-sides" and concluding that everywhere one looks there is "discord, distraction, and bewilderment" (84-85). To emphasize the importance of preserving the often precarious relationships between species of trees, Wordsworth adds a long section to the third edition of the Guide , published in 1822, in which he compares the Swiss Alps unfavorably to the mountains of northern England. Noting with some nationalist pride that the Alps have less species diversity than the Lake District fells, he says that the result is a grievous loss of natural har- mony in the Alps: Among the interior vallies the proportion of beeches and pines is so great that other trees are scarcely noticeable; and surely such woods are at all seasons much less agreeable than that rich and harmonious distribution of oak, ash, elm, birch, and alder, that formerly clothed the sides of Snowdon and Helvellyn; and of which no mean remains still survive at the head of Ullswater. (1822 Description 120) Although Wordsworth here ranks the arboreal diversity of the Alps below that of such renowned Lake District peaks as Helvellyn, he casts in past tense his description of the forest on Helvellyn's sides, saying that "formerly" it was a study in biodiversity. Even by Wordsworth's day the area east of Thirlmere Lake, on the lower elevations of Helvellyn, had been planted with conifers. Consequently the native broadleaved trees that formerly flourished there - the oaks and ashes and birches that Wordsworth mentions - were becoming increasingly scarce. It is important to pause here a moment to note that in 1979 the National Park Authority instituted a program, still in effect today, to eradicate large tracts of conifers such as the larch from the Lake Dis- trict National Park, precisely because these trees have outcompeted the native hardwood species there and are rapidly acidifying the soil (Wyatt 109; The Lake Ch.8, p.4). According to the National Park Au- thority, conifer plantations significantly compound the problem of acid rain because as rainwater drips through the needles of conifers its acid- ity increases anywhere between threefold and tenfold ( The Lake Ch.8, p. 7). As a result such broadleaved species as the sessile oak, a native tree that is not nearly as acid-tolerant as conifers, cannot compete in areas where conifers are planted. That Wordsworth in the 1822 edition of the Guide would also point to the proliferation of beech trees in the Alps as somehow problematic</page><page sequence="7">Neither Deep nor Shallow but National 67 is as prophetic as his earlier comments on the larch. Ironically, even as he attempted to dissuade Lake District settlers from planting larches on their property, the first generation of Victorian settlers were culti- vating their gardens with ornamental copper beeches, a species that was as aggressive as most conifers in outcompeting native oak, ash, alder, and hazel. The beech tree is native in Great Britain only in south- ern England and southeast Wales, but as an import to the Lake Dis- trict it immediately became a garden escapee and spread rapidly throughout the area (Soutar and Peterken 14). As a means of illustrat- ing how quickly the beech has come to dominate the landscape of the Lakes, in one of his "Poems on the Naming of Places" Wordsworth describes John's Grove, a favorite haunt near Dove Cottage where he and his brother John used to walk, as having "a single beech-tree" growing among a grove of firs. Today the modern tourist who strolls through John's Grove will find a thick forest of beech trees but only a single "fir" - that is, a Scots pine - left (McCracken 29, 205). If the literary scholar condescends to consult the botanist on this matter, she learns that this rapid turnover in tree species in the woods just south of Grasmere occurred because the beech has an unusually dense canopy of leaves that allows precious little sunlight to penetrate down to the soil. As a shade tolerant tree, it is able to choke out most shade-sensitive trees such as the sessile oak and thus regenerate quickly without significant competition. The National Park Authority has rec- ognized the deleterious effects of the unchecked spread of beech wood, and under its new policy for broadleaved woodlands it uses strong language to condemn the planting of beech trees for the purposes of broadleaved woodland restoration. "Beech is not native to the Lake District," reads the policy statement, "and under planting oak or ash woodland with beech . . . would be very dangerous from a nature conservation viewpoint due to the dense shade cast by this species" (The Lake Ch.6, p.6). In a significant but no doubt unintentional echo of Wordsworth, the Park Authority adds, "using non-native species can result in the deterioration and in some cases the destruction of a major part of the [native] wood" (Ch.6, p.6). One may safely conclude that at the very least Wordsworth's warning against the cultivation of non- native species has become a standard battle cry of the Forestry Com- mission of the Lake District National Park. III. If Wordsworth developed an increasingly alarmist attitude toward the proliferation of non-native tree species over the twenty-five years he reworked his Guide , the various editions also show that he became</page><page sequence="8">68 ISLE ever more nationalistic in his rejection of foreign environmental mod- els. In the opening pages of his 1810 edition of Select Views, for in- stance, Wordsworth touts both the variety and harmony of the Lake District valleys, saying that their pleasing arrangement "gives to the country a decided superiority over the most attractive districts of Scot- land and Wales." Not content with merely dismissing England's Brit- ish cousins for their inferior mountain landscapes, Wordsworth adds that invariably an English tourist to Scotland is downright relieved when leaving a valley and thereby escaping "the barrenness and deso- lation through which he has passed" ( Guide 26-27). Twelve years later, when revising his text for the third time for the 1822 edition of the Guide , Wordsworth adds a long section in which he extends his landscape comparisons well beyond his pre- vious geographical parameters. By way of apologizing for the rela- tively dwarfish size of the Lake District mountains (the highest of which, Scafell Pike, at 3210 feet is only one-fourth the height of many peaks in the Swiss Alps), Wordsworth says that what the English mountains lack in size they are compensated for in subtle forms of beauty. The surfaces of the Swiss Alps, argues Wordsworth, are regularly mown on their lower regions and therefore have "noth- ing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf, that is never touched by the scythe, is distinguished" (1822 Description 116). Their coloring is "ill suited to the pencil," "not often graduated by Nature into soothing harmony" (118). Here Wordsworth willingly commits the sin of omission insofar as he knows that the Lake District fells were once covered in trees and alpine vegetation from valley floor to mountain peak before Neolithic populations settled the area and began deforesting the fellsides and grazing their livestock there.5 For several centuries prior to Wordsworth's residence in the Lake District the widespread presence of sheep on every mountain ensured that the turf there "is never touched by the scythe"; sheep do in England what man does in Switzerland. Elsewhere in the 1822 Guide Wordsworth contends that the inter- play between the Lake District peaks and the ever-changing cloud for- mations above them is so mysterious on most days that it leaves the viewer breathless, marveling at the "visionary character" of the scene. Such views, Wordsworth concludes, "often tempt an inhabitant [of England] to congratulate himself on belonging to a country of mists and clouds and storms, and make him think of the blank sky of Egypt, and of the cerulean vacancy of Italy, as an unanimated and even sad spectacle" (36). Not content to gaze skyward, however, Wordsworth looks under his boot-soles and even extols the unparalleled beauty of</page><page sequence="9">Neither Deep nor Shallow but National 69 English lichens and mosses, saying, "their profusion, beauty, and va- riety, exceed those of any country I have seen" (34). A year later, when he re-edited the Guide for its fourth edition, Wordsworth added several long paragraphs in which he praises, among other things, the superior weather of northern England (1823 Description 31-33). Although one should admire Wordsworth's spir- ited defense of Cumbria, the county of his birth, this is an absolutely ludicrous claim for an area that averages 180 inches of rain per year in its interior regions (Wyatt 85). Wordsworth's insistence elsewhere in the 1820 and 1822 editions of his Guide that the Lake District has sur- passingly gorgeous waterfalls and streams which are wholly unlike the disgustingly muddy and foamy rivers in the Alps ( Topographical 318) leads one to believe that the poet has an aversion to continental landscapes generally and must have had a miserable time of it during his walking tour of the Alps in the summer of 1790. One is tempted to dismiss Wordsworth's rankings of English over continental scenery as either disingenuous or a case of Anglican solipsism, as Aldous Huxley has argued.6 But Wordsworth's ap- propriation of a variety of European landscapes to champion his native ecosystem over all others hints at something larger: the poet suffered from a form of ecoxenophobia. This is not to say that Huxley's suspicion of Wordsworth's relatively circumscribed wan- derings is immaterial; he theorized with some justification that Wordsworth's unwillingness to travel beyond the boundaries of Europe revealed an inability to confront raw nature "under a verti- cal sun" in a place far distant from "the prettiness, the cozy sub- limities of the Lake District" (1). And yet Wordsworth's own ad- vertisements for the Lake District's charms signal more than a mere reluctance to sample hostile nature in far-off climes. For Wordsworth, the Lake District itself came to represent an isolation- ist "Englishness" in its most affirmative sense, from the harmoni- ous distribution of its native trees to the superior coloring of its mountain turf and magically shifting skies. Why travel to savage equatorial zones to experience exotic biospheres when a comfort- ably tamed corner of England can offer a domesticated sublimity unmatched anywhere on the globe? The real problem, according to Wordsworth, is the threat posed by those who come from afar, bring- ing with them uncultivated aesthetic sensibilities nursed by for- eign landscapes and tastes. Ultimately Wordsworth suggests that foreigners who bring non- native flora into northern England - no matter the cultural distance they have traveled - are contributing to the ruination of an ecosystem and, because of their ignorance of the way that ecosystem works, the</page><page sequence="10">70 ISLE ruination of a culture that in its previously insular condition had been for centuries a kind of Eden, "a perfect Republic of Shepherds and Agriculturists" ( Guide 67). Nowhere is Wordsworth's linking of non- native plants and the foreigners who import them to the Lake District more telling than in the third section of his Guide, in the same para- graph where he criticizes the cultivation of larch plantations. Here he excoriates those who plant larches, whether for profit or for ornamen- tation. It is a long passage, and a passage that he never altered over five editions of the Guide, but worth quoting in its entirety: Both these classes of persons, I would entreat to inquire of themselves wherein that beauty which they admire consists. They would then see that, after the feeling has been gratified that prompts us to gather round our dwelling a few flowers and shrubs, which from the circumstance of their not being native, may, by their very looks, remind us that they owe their existence to our hands, and their property to our care; they will see that, after this natural desire has been provided for, the course of all beyond has been predetermined by the spirit of the place. Before I proceed, I will remind those who are not satisfied with the restraint thus laid upon them, that they are liable to a charge of inconsistency, when they are so eager to change the face of that country, whose na- tive attractions, by the act of erecting their habitations in it, they have so emphatically acknowledged. ( Guide 83) The purport of this passage is to show how the natural environ- ment that first attracted these immigrants is now compromised by their inability to exist in it without fundamentally altering its "face." And yet Wordsworth is not finished. In his insistence that non-na- tive plant species serve to "remind us that they owe their existence to our hands, and their property to our care," Wordsworth aims an arrow at the very foreignness of those who, having come to settle this sacred place, have also failed to cultivate an aesthetic appre- ciation for its natural features or an understanding of how or why they are worth preserving. That Wordsworth felt betrayed by foreign settlers to the Lake Dis- trict, whether from nearby Manchester or from London, is undeni- able. That he associated such intruders with continental peoples and non-native flora is also unequivocally true. Clearly he feared the ef- fects of the landscaping practices he witnessed and felt a personal antipathy for those who were altering his native ecosystem. His final comment on the larch plantations offers both a defense of native plant species and a spirited suggestion that those who favor importing ex- otics ought to leave well enough alone and stay away from Cumbria altogether. "And surely," concludes Wordsworth in 1810, "there is not</page><page sequence="11">Neither Deep nor Shallow but National 71 a single spot in this country that would not have, if well managed, sufficient dignity to support itself, unaided by the productions of other climates, or by elaborate decorations which might be becoming else- where" ( Select xxix, italics mine). In 1820 Wordsworth deleted the phrase "in this country" from the last sentence of his paragraph, a suggestion that he himself was aware of the nationalistic tone that he was striking and that his defense of the Lake District was in danger of metamorphosing into an indictment of any foreign import to England. Wordsworth's strident opposition to the importation of non-native plants, his aesthetic and environmental objections to altering a land- scape he considered under siege, his distaste for the new generation of immigrants to the Lake District - all of these sentiments coalesce in a work that at the same time extols England's ecological features as superior to those of every other European nation. The modern reader of Wordsworth's several editions of the Guide cannot help being at least slightly discomforted by the poet's increas- ing hostility over time to alien landscapes and the people who left them for northern England. Living as we do at the dawn of the twenty- first century, we read his Guide through the lens of a troubled recent history, our perspective informed by the rising tide of globalization and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Seen in the light cast by modern global political events, Wordsworth's pronouncements are clearly problematic. While it is appropriate - and important - for us to continue to extol Wordsworth as an advocate of ecological aware- ness and bioregional belonging, we must not ignore the more trou- bling questions that proceed from his celebration of homeland. If, as the Guide indicates, Wordsworth became progressively more isolation- ist in temperament and critical of outside influences on his country's ecological features, we should read his work not only as an alarmist call for a more sustainable local ecology but an exercise in nationalis- tic rhetoric. Although ecocritics have given ample attention to the ways in which Wordsworth's body of poetry demonstrates an evolving en- vironmental consciousness, perhaps a closer look at his prose is long overdue. Reading such works as the Guide can help to inform us how Wordsworth used the discourse of nationhood to define the ideal eco- system - and its antithesis. Given Wordsworth's yearnings in the last decade of his life to be left alone in a pristine environment, his career as an environmentalist and guidebook writer has its crowning irony. Before he died in 1850, Wordsworth planted eight yew trees throughout St. Oswald's church- yard in Grasmere, thinking them the finest natural symbol of eternal life. A native to the Lake District, the yew has been known to live as long as a thousand years, and in a poem Wordsworth once called this</page><page sequence="12">72 ISLE favorite tree "a living thing / Produced too slowly ever to decay / Of form and aspect too magnificent / To be destroyed" ("Yew-Trees" Selected Poems 208). The visitor who today stands at Wordsworth's grave in this same churchyard sees a marvelous specimen of a yew, planted by his own hand, shading the graves of his family. Not more than twenty yards away, just opposite Wordsworth's grave along the Rothay River and shading the spot where many tourists pause to snap a photo of the poet's tombstone, stands a veritable upstart amidst this yard of ancient trees. It is an English larch.
