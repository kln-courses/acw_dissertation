<plain_text><page sequence="1">Liza Williams Other Days, by John Haines To one who lives in the snow and watches it day by day, it is a a book to be read. The pages turn as the wind blows; the characters shift and the images formed by their combinations change in meaning , but the language remains the same. It is a shadow language, spoken by things that have gone by and will come again. The same text has been written there for thousands of years, though I was not here, and will not be here in winters to come, to read it. These seemingly random ways, these paths, these beds, these footprints, these hard, round pellets in the snow ; they all have meaning. Dark things may be written there, news of other lives, their sorties and excursions, their terrors and deaths. The tiny feet of a shrew or a vole make a brief, erratic pattern across the snow, and here is a hole down which the animal goes. And now the track of an ermine comes this way, swift and searching, and he too goes down that white shadow of a hole. * * * Due in April from Graywolf Press (Port Townsend, Wash- ington) is a limited edition of essays by John Haines. Inspired by his homesteading years in the Alaskan woods, the eight essays, called Other Days and subtitled "Selections from a Work in Progress," are the forerunners of a collection of meditative pieces ranging over the nearly twenty years of the author's wilderness experience. A poet with some half-dozen volumes of verse to his credit, Haines presents here in the jewel-like setting of a small-press run some of his impressions in prose. It is hard to characterize this book, to decide on its genre, for although at first glance the essays appear to be non-fiction, they contain a measure of both fiction and poetry. Little information is included to locate events in the standard narra- tive manner. Resonant diction and an almost chant-like style 100</page><page sequence="2">Other Days , by John Haines that builds from a litany of naturalistic detail give the work the quality of a prose poem. Under headings like "Snow" and "Spring" and "Wolves," the essays are ruminations in an out- door setting; their subjects serve less as foci of description than as springboards for Haines's contemplations on his intensely personal world view. His is a world of shadow, dream, and myth superimposed on the elements. Throughout the work runs an undercurrent of identification with nature and particularly with the Native American concept of the spirituality of animals and trees. Here in the woods man is enmeshed in the seasonal rhythm and ritual of the prehistoric predator. Confirming this is the sense of Haines's alienation from mainstream, or mainland, consumerist society, the world of "clockhands, hours and wages." The persistent voice of the poet in Other Days gives rise to the greatest strengths in the book as well as its weaknesses. The prose is highly crafted, structured with an ear tuned to meter, rhyme, and alliteration, heard in phrases like "swift and search- ing," "seeps and drips," "fumed and droned," and in longer combinations such as "three wolves trotted east toward Banner Creek." Some of the sentences lacking verbs are punctuated with strong pause marks such as dashes and semicolons. This is also true of many of Haines's poems. (In fact, a look at his verse, especially Winter News from which numerous images in these essays were drawn, helps to inform the prose.) Internal contradictions, if they are presented with control, can lend energy to a piece of writing, as do many of Haines's ambiguous feelings about the wilderness. Though he embraces and celebrates the role of the self-sufficient hunter, he feels uneasy with killing, and confers anthropomorphic qualities on the creatures with which he comes in contact. And at the same time that "Nothing I have done in life pleases me as much as this" chosen lifestyle, he resists the constant laboriousness and demands of that existence and longs "to do nothing, to be nothing ... be still, like a stone in the sun" or a bear in hiberna- tion. Some of the inconsistencies in Haines's essays, though, are not controlled, and undermine the effectiveness of the work as a whole. Many of these result from careless editorial splicing of 101</page><page sequence="3">Liza Williams material excerpted from a variety of sources. For example, the unexplained comment . . while Jo makes supper" - Jo Haines was the author's wife during some of this time, and creator of the line drawings which illustrate the essays - throws into question other references in the next piece to "a wife far off," or, being "alone in my thirty-third year, strange to myself and the few people I know." The underlying question is never answered: Why is Haines here in the first place? Why has he chosen this solitude, this wilderness? For the reader this anonymity, except Ã¡s a personal, reflec- tive voice, can be disconcerting. An introduction, jacket notes, or some sort of connective tissue provided between essays would have solved some of these problems. Still, Haines seems more interested in subjective observations on his immediate sphere, his woods, than in the details of how he arrived there or why. Though he has a vigorous local following in the Northwest, and is known in poetic circles as a "sleeping giant," Haines's name will be unfamiliar to many readers of prose. It may be that only confirmed Haines enthusiasts will have access to the book at all, with the three hundred paperbound copies priced at $16 each, and the hundred hardbacks at $40. But we may hope for an expanded version which, grounded in a context, will add Haines's special vision to the growing body of new literature of the American West. 102</page></plain_text>
