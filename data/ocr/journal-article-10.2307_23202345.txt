<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LEFT SIDE OF GOD: A REFLECTION OF CABALA IN MICHELANGELO'S GENESIS SCENES Michelangelo's Genesis scenes on the Sistine Ceiling (1508-1512) are rich in levels of meaning and filled with enigmatic icono graphic detail. Because the scenes are located in the most renowned papal chapel in the Vatican, their Old Testament dramas have been interpreted extensively in terms of Catholic theology. The scenes also have been analyzed in terms of Renaissance history and Neoplatonism.1 To this group of secondary levels of meaning should be added a cabalis tic one. Cabala was a new topic of study among Christian erudites close to Michelangelo during the Renaissance. The word cabala, meaning both "tradition" and "reception," is applied to a group of mystical books, dating from the Middle Ages and earlier, that were handed down orally before transcription, mostly from learned rabbis to their pupils, but also reputedly from the angels to Adam, from God to Moses, or from Enoch to his descendants. The cast of recognizably cabalistic charac ters in the scenes includes the En-Sof and the Knowable Lord, Adam's first wife Lilith, and the Shekhinah, the Lord's female beloved. This article will focus on the cabalist doctrine of the Deity and the ways that doctrine is re flected in Michelangelo's first two scenes. It will also consider a component of that doc trine: that the left side of God's body is femi nine and the source for all females. Michelangelo's exposure to cabalistic doc trines probably came indirectly through Christian cabalists of his time. Foremost in Jane Schuyler importance is Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494), known to his contemporaries as the "first Christian cabalist," who at age twenty-three proposed a great public debate in Rome, where he would defend his Conclu siones Philosophicae Cabalisticae et TJieologi cae (published in Rome in I486).2 Pico's re ception was not what he expected. Forced to appear before a commission appointed in 1486 by Pope Innocent VIII, Pico learned that thirteen of his theses had been con demned. Pico had written his most famous work, the Oratio (later known as L'Oratio de hominis dignitate), to open his public debate on the theses, and it was published early in 1487 as the introduction to his Apologia, in which he defied the Church by expounding on the condemned theses. Eventually, Pico was captured by papal nuncios and imprisoned at Vincennes. His release was obtained through the help of supporters, the foremost among whom was Lorenzo de' Medici. Pico dedi cated two of his publications to Lorenzo the Magnificent: the Apologia of 1486 and the Heptaplus of 1489, the latter a sevenfold commentary on Genesis with Neoplatonic and cabalistic overtones. Lorenzo, in turn, defended Pico, helped to publish and dis tribute the Heptaplus, brought Pico to Flo rence, and honored him as a member of the Platonic Academy. Michelangelo (born in 1475) lived with the Medici in their palazzo on the Via Larga from 1490 until April 8, 1492, the date of Lorenzo's death.4 There Michelangelo was exposed to the members of Lorenzo's Pla</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 Michelangelo, Separation of Light from Darkness. tine Chapel Ceiling tonic Academy as well as to visiting scholars. While the Academy is known for its interest in ancient Greek and Roman writings, it was also where Christian speculation concerning cabala initially flourished. Michelangelo probably first learned of cabala while in the Medici household-from conversations with Pico or with others, from Pico's writings, or from translations of Hebrew cabalistic writ ings in the Medici library. During the planning and painting of the Sistine Ceiling, Michelangelo also had access to clerics interested in cabala, such as Egidio da Viterbo.5 Pico's writings were made even more available by a posthumous edition of his collected works, published in 1496 by his nephew Gianfrancesco Pico, an adviser to Pope Julius II.6 Giovanni Pico's writings are replete with the names of Hebrew authors from medieval times whose works he had read in Hebrew or in translation. The contents of Pico's personal library have been researched by Paul Oskar Kristeller, Eugenio Garin, and Eugenio</page><page sequence="3">Í4 Anagnine.7 Pico owned or borrowed such ba sic books of cabala as the Zohar, the Book Yetsirah, and the Book Bahir. Pico's library also contained several Midrashim, the Mish nah and other parts of the Talmud, other commentaries on Jewish law and customs, and several unspecified cabalistic manu scripts. My interpretation of four Genesis scenes on the Sistine Ceiling is based pri marily on the cabalistic writings by authors cited by Pico and on Pico's own publications. Cabalistic notions of the Divine Creator, of the En-Sof, and of the ten spheres of the Sefiroth appear as words and concepts in Pico's writings and are reflected in two of the Genesis scenes (Figs. 1 and 2). Basic to ca balistic beliefs is the doctrine of the Deity, which distinguishes between the Knowable Lord, the God of religious experience, and the unknowable En-Sof, literally "the infinite." The En-Sof is the deus absconditus, or hidden God, "the paradoxical fullness of the great di vine Nothing," which is beyond man's under standing.8 The En-Sof and the Creator have been explained by Gershom Scholem, the great authority on Jewish mysticism, as one God experienced from two different perspec tives of man-the first beyond man's compre hension and the second accessible through mysticism.9 Early cabalists used esoteric lan guage as they adumbrated a process of ema nation whereby the En-Sof preceded and generated the Manifest Lord. They visualized the Hidden God as an all-encompassing and dark Nothingness turned inward and mani festing power or essence through various stages of emanation. The stages, called the Sefiroth, are ten in number and described as great lights, spheres, realms, and jewels, among other things; they bear names that are descriptions or epithets that can be applied to God. Hence, each Sefirali reveals an aspect of the Lord's nature, and together they encompass His awesome totality. The dynamic interrela tionships of the Sefiroth, a major cabalistic concern, reveal the inner workings of the Godhead, and the Sefiroth's ordering provides an abstract configuration for the Knowable Lord's body. The ten spheres of the Sefiroth often were envisioned one inside the other as a type of Michelangelo, Creation of the Sun and Moon. 1511. Sistine Chapel Ceiling</page><page sequence="4">15 cosmic union, but they were just as frequently represented schematically as a tree of life, such as in an engraving that serves as the title page in Andrea Riccio's Portae Lucis. Com pleted about 1510 and published in Amster dam in 1516, Portae Lucis is the fourth vol ume of his De coelesti agricultura, which con tains the "Introduction to the Lore of the Cabalists or Allegorizers" and a translation of Gikatilla's thirteenth-century Sha'are orah. The sefirotic tree of life is shown as a tower ing but apparently weightless construction of ten circles, each containing a word in He brew: (1) Kether, the Supreme Crown; (2) Hokhmah, Wisdom; (3) Binah, Understand ing or Intelligence; (4) Gedulah, Greatness or Magnificence; (5) Gevurah, Power or Stern Judgment; (6) Tiferetli, Beauty, Glory, or Compassion; (7) Netzach, Lasting Endurance or Victory; (8) Hod, Glory or Majesty; (9) Yesod, the Foundation or Basis of all active forces in God; (10) Malkliuth, the Kingdom. Cabala differs from traditional Judaism in the belief that God's nature has male and fe male elements. The right is considered the male and active side of the tree or of the Lord's body, while the left is the female and passive side. In the engraving, the feminine Sefiroth appear on the right because the Lord is "facing" the viewer. Gevurah, the stern Judgment of God, on the female left, is unique as the source for destructive and demonic powers. It was a ca balistic speculation that evil was a part of God and that it came from the left, feminine side. In Michelangelo's Temptation and Ex pulsion, Lilith, the half-human female ser pent, tempts Adam and Eve from the left side of the tree of knowledge and dangles the for bidden fruit from her left hand. Kether, Hokhmah, and Binah are known as the Supernals; this trinity-of both sexes constitutes the highest creative aspects of the universe. Riccio's illuminator broke the usual straightness of the two side pillars in order to stress the nature of this trinity, which Chris tian cabalists such as Pico related to the Trinity.10 The Separation of Light from Darkness (Fig. 1), Michelangelo's first creation scene in terms of a Biblical sequence but among the last he was to paint, depicts the white Fig. 3 Michelangelo, Creation of Adam. 1511. Sistine Chapel Ceiling</page><page sequence="5">16 bearded En-Sof, unknowable because His en shadowed face is almost totally obscured from view. His mature body is twisted in a dramatic contrapposto amid swirling light and darkness of a cosmic event, as the per sonified Darkness (Hidden God) generates the light of the Sefiroth (Manifest God). The large circular patterns formed by His arms and by His billowing drapery may allude to the spherical Sefiroth. In the Creation of the Sun and Moon (Fig. 2), the En-Sof is shown from behind, His face again unknown, while the Knowable Lord is seen from the front, His face illumined by the sun, which He has created. The pink costume and physical characteristics of the En-Sof and the Creator here are identical because They are two manifestations of one God, yet Their persons are clearly differentiated according to the dictates of cabala: the En-Sof is a solitary figure, without the company of the angelic hosts; the Knowable Lord, on the other hand, is accompanied by the angels, who comprehend His every thought and will. The Knowable Lord alone is responsible for the rest of creation, and He is the one shown in the remainder of Michelangelo's creation scenes, His face always visible and His body usually accompanied by the cherubim. Michelangelo's omission of the angelic forms from the first scene is at variance with Saint Augustine's City of God but in keeping with cabala. For Saint Augustine had read into the account of the separation of light from darkness a reference to the origin of two classes of angels, the good and evil: "Assuming the creation of the first light to refer to the creation of the angels, the dis tinction between the holy and unclean angels is described in the passage, 'And God divided the Light from the Darkness.' 1,11 In contrast, the Bahir states that the angels were created on the second day so that they could not claim to be co-creators with God. 2 Michelangelo's second scene follows a ca balistic sequence: first, the En-Sof generates His primal emanation, the sefirotic tree, rep resented in the lower left corner by a growth of fern branches from a rounded promontory evocative of a treetop; next, the Knowable Lord, in anthropomorphic form, creates the greater and lesser lights. The Knowable Lord uses a sweeping and dramatic gesture to command the separation of the sun from the moon, and His lack of pleasure in this act is reflected in His contorted face. The act of separation itself, the disruption of the perfect Unity within Him, seems to be the source of His anger. The curvature of the Lord's body implies that the sun and moon are being compelled from Him in opposite directions along a horizontal arc. In the moment previ ous, the two orbs belonged to the space now occupied by the Lord; they are being split not only from each other but from the person of the Lord. Here, the scene incorporates two levels of meaning: the division of the sun from the moon, which refers to the Lord's action in Genesis, and, more importantly, the generation of the Trinity as expounded by Christian cabalists. The sun mentioned in Genesis was equated with Christ by Pico in the Heptaplus, and the association of the sun with Christ the "Light of the world" is deeply rooted in Early Chris tian iconography. In a recent article, Staale Sinding-Larsen identified the sun with the Second Person of the Trinity; but instead of recognizing the Third Person as the moon, he dwelt on Marian associations and proposed that the moon symbolizes Mary and the Church.13 The linkage of the moon and the Holy Spirit is less familiar but appears in the Zohar, where the ruach ha-kodesh is symbol ized by the moon, as is the heavenly Shekhi nah, resident of Binah.14 Christian cabalists associated the Father with the first of the Sefiroth, Kether, the Son with the second,</page><page sequence="6">17 Hokhmah, and the Holy Spirit with the third, Binah. In traditional cabalistic beliefs, Kether is One in the sense that it is the first of the ten Sefiroth but also in the sense that it existed prior to the others and contained the other nine. It is this One who generates the other spheres from Himself, and this is pre cisely the action suggested in Michelangelo's rendering. The two orbs have left the space occupied by the body of the Lord, the sun from His right, the location of Hokhmah on the masculine side of the sefirotic tree, and the moon from His left, the location of Binah on the feminine side of the sefirotic tree. Christian cabalists were criticized for exactly this alteration of Trinitarian doctrine of "Three in One" into their "Three Out of One."15 The Knowable Lord's emotion at the separation of the sun and moon becomes more comprehensible when understood as the generation of the Trinity. In the Creation of Adam (Fig. 3), a young woman is nestled in the crook of the Lord's arm, as if emerging from His left side; she can be identified as the Shekhinah. Just as Eve will emerge from androgynous Adam's left side, so the Shekhinah emerges from the left side of God. While in traditional Judaism the Shekhinah is a manifestation of the pres ence of God in the world and, hence, male, in cabala the Shekhinah is a female beloved of the Lord, with Whom there is ecstatic sexual union and from Whom there are agonizing exiles. She is a separate personality who acts as a paraclete on behalf of mankind. She may stand before the Lord, yet she is also a part of the Lord's body, one of the female compo nents of His nature. Cabalists usually placed the abodes of the Shekhinah in the third Sefi rah, Binah, associated with the Trinitarian Supernals, and in the tenth Sefirah, Malkhuth, making her a bridge between what is above and below. As a result of her closeness to the Lord, the Shekhinah is identified with the community of Israel, the mystical Jewish Ec clesia, and the neshamah, the spiritus or highest part of the tripartite soul. In Michelangelo's scene, she turns her head around to view Adam, who has just been im bued or will be imbued with the neshamah (herself). Her hand affectionately encircles the Lord's left arm as if to suggest that she lovingly accepts a part in man's redemption, as will the Messiah, the infant Christ, linked to them by proximity and His Father's left hand.16 Michelangelo, through her presence, gives concrete form to Genesis 1:27, where God made man "male and female" in His likeness: Adam has been formed as a reflec tion of the Lord's masculine appearance but is still androgynous, while the Lord's feminine nature, personified by the Shekhinah, emerges from His left side as the prototype for all females. Likewise, in the fifth scene, the Creation of Eve, Adam's reclining body is turned so that his left side is clearly the source for Eve. Eve seems about to stumble as she steps toward the Knowable Lord, for her right foot is either embedded up to the ankle in Adam's left side or caught on something behind him. Michelangelo seems to be making a Hebrew pun, for the word tsela, meaning "rib," also means "a stumbling." If Michelangelo in tended to follow the teaching of the Church here, he would have portrayed Eve emerging from an incision in Adam's right side as a parallel to the wound in Christ's right side. In Christian interpretations of Genesis 2:21-22, Eve's emergence from Adam's side prefigures the birth of the Church: the incision in Adam's chest anticipates the wound in Christ's side, and Eve's emergence from Adam's side anticipates Christ's blood-and Church—issuing from that wound. While the Evangelists did not specify the side, Saint Augustine's assertion that it had been Christ's right came to be accepted by the Church.</page><page sequence="7">18 That Michelangelo was fully aware of this tradition is demonstrated in his Drunkenness of Noah, where Noah, who also serves as an antetype for Christ, has a wine bowl situated by his right side. The Creation of Eve thus provides another notable instance where Michelangelo did not follow Augustinian teaching, but opted instead for cabalistic iconography. There can be no doubt that the program of the Genesis scenes was influenced by the new Renaissance study of Jewish cabala.
