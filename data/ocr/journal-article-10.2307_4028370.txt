<plain_text><page sequence="1">BJHS, 2001, 34, 379-393 Francis Bacon's concept of objectivity and the idols of the mind PEREZ ZAGORIN* Abstract. This paper examines the concept of objectivity traceable in Francis Bacon's natural philosophy. After some historical background on this concept, it considers the question of whether it is not an anachronism to attribute such a concept to Bacon, since the word 'objectivity' is a later coinage and does not appear anywhere in his writings. The essay gives reasons for answering this question in the negative, and then criticizes the accounts given of Bacon's understanding of objectivity by Lorraine Daston and Julie Robin Solomon. It argues that this understanding is most directly and fully expressed in his discussion of the idols of the mind. In this connection, the paper notes Bacon's critical attitude to sixteenth-century scepticism and its relevance to the idea of objectivity implicit in his comments on the idols. In conclusion, the paper argues that Bacon was not a pure empiricist and describes the place assigned to theories and hypotheses in his natural philosophy. In contemporary philosophical and other discourse, the term 'objectivity' is mainly used with three principal meanings in mind, all of which are related to one another in the sense of sharing family resemblances as described by Wittgenstein in his well-known remarks on meaning and language games.' As commonly understood, objectivity can denote any one of the following: first, the true and certain knowledge of a thing, property or state of affairs; second, a method of enquiry designed and competent to elicit a true knowledge, understanding or explanation of a thing, property or state of affairs; third, a type of judgement or mental disposition on the part of scientists, scholars, moralists, philosophers and other investigators that sets aside prejudice, partiality and predetermined answers in the process of any kind of enquiry and the appraisal of its results. All three of these definitions are among those attributed to or implied by the word 'objective' and its cognate term 'objectivity' in the tenth, 1994 edition of my Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, and may also be found among the definitions of 'objective' in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary; although framed to my purpose, they also correspond closely to the several meanings of objectivity which Allan Megill has summarized in his useful discussion in an issue, devoted to the question of objectivity, of the journal Annals of Scholarship.2 While thinking and language are obviously very closely connected, it is certainly possible * 2990 Beaumont Farm Road, Charlottesville, Virginia 22901, USA. 1 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, 3rd edn., New York, 1970, nos. 66-7. 2 Allan Megill, 'Four senses of objectivity', Annals of Scholarship (1991), 8, 301-20.

In the Western intellectual tradition, some of the ingredients presently constituting the concept of objectivity long antedated the time of Francis Bacon and can be traced back to classical antiquity, despite the fact that in neither Greek nor Latin is there a particular word that designates this concept. Terms like the Greek di'kaios and the Latin aequum, however, whose meanings included fairness and lack of bias as well as what is right or equitable, contained distinct connotations that are clearly part of the semantic field pertaining to our word 'objectivity' and its uses in various contexts. In Greek philosophy an awareness of what might be called ontological objectivity as the determination of the way things really are was implicit in the speculations and enquiries of some of the pre-Socratic thinkers, Plato and Aristotle, which aimed at attaining true and certain knowledge of the necessary and universal features of reality or the natural world. Aristotle's enquiry into the nature of being, for example, which he pursued in his Metaphysics, and the theory and logic of scientific explanation outlined in his Posterior Analytics, which explains that we possess 'scientific knowledge when we ... know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause of that fact and of no other and, further, that the fact could not be other than it is',3 presupposed a type of knowledge that is unconditioned, necessary, absolute and, hence, entirely objective. Similarly, a perception of at least a part of what is involved in historical objectivity underlies the claim of Greek and Roman historians to describe the facts and explain their causes truly and impartially. Thucydides' observations on the method of writing history, which he placed near the beginning of his History of the Peloponnesian War, his comments on the early history of Greece and his deep probing into the causes of the war between Athens and Sparta, clearly intimate or envisage the idea of a self-consciously critical and objective historical knowledge.4 A consciousness of objectivity is likewise evident in the pledge of the Roman historian Tacitus to relate the events of the Emperor Augustus' reign without either passion or partiality ('sine ira et studio'); and also in his denial that his political elevation under the emperors Vespasian, Titus and Domitian had impaired his impartiality as a historian who held the truth to be inviolable.5 When we pass from the ancient world to the sixteenth century and Francis Bacon (b. 1561), we observe that the word 'objectivity' does not appear anywhere in his writings, since at that period it did not yet exist in English or any other European language. As several scholars have pointed out, its lexical origin is the non-classical Latin adjective ' objectivus', which medieval and early modern scholastic philosophers used in the phrase 3 Aristotle, Posterior Analytics, 71b8-12, or Book I, Chapter 2. 4 Thucydides, History, 1.1-21. When Thucydides comes to tell about the plague at Athens in the second year of the war, he says he will leave aside all speculation as to its origin but simply describe its nature and symptoms; History, 2.48. This statement, it is worth noting, furnished the inspiration for the best known epitome of the principle of historical objectivity in the nineteenth century as formulated in the famous comment of Leopold von Ranke that the task of history was not to judge the past but to show what had actually happened ('wie es eigentlich gewesen'). Ranke's dictum is an almost direct quotation from Thucydides and appears in the Preface to his own History of the Latin and Germanic Nations from 1494-1514, Leipzig, 1824, and also recurs in some of his other writings; see the passages from Ranke reprinted in Fritz Stern, The Varieties of History, Cleveland, 1956, 57, 58, and for Ranke's use of Thucydides' remark, see M. I. Finley, 'How it really was', Ancient History and Models, London, 1985, 47-8, 116 n. 5. 5 Tacitus, Annals, 1.1; idem, Histories, 1.1.</page><page sequence="3">Francis Bacon's concept of objectivity 381 conceptus objectivus to signify an external object insofar as it is present to the mind.6 Not until about the mid-nineteenth century and after did the word 'objective' enter the English language with some of the meanings it presently possesses, while 'objectivity' is even more of a latecomer to the philosopher's lexicon.7 This raises the problem of whether it is not a dangerous anachronism to speak of a conception of objectivity in reference either to Bacon or to any of the philosophers or historians of antiquity. The short answer to this question is that in trying to understand and analyse the beliefs and ideas of past societies and cultures, historians and philosophers must not only learn to comprehend the language and concepts by which these societies and cultures understood themselves and reflected upon the world, but also are often obliged to apply to them other and later concepts of which they were ignorant or only partially and inadequately possessed. Prior to the emergence of the modern term 'objectivity' and its multiple semantic affiliations constituting an entire family of meanings, it seems to be undeniable that notions approximating some of the contemporary meanings of objectivity are to be found in Western philosophy, law and historiography, for example. If there is a risk of anachronism in talking of objectivity in connection with Bacon or any of his philosophic predecessors, the same risk is equally present when we speak, as everyone unavoidably does, of science in ancient Greece or during the Renaissance, since at neither period was there any word or idea synonymous with all the meanings we have in mind when we use the word 'science' today. Indeed, historians of whatever field would find their task impossible if they were barred from using concepts and terminology unknown to those whom they study. In such cases of conceptual translation from the present to the past, I believe that historians and philosophers need not worry about misleading readers by anachronism provided they take care to make the necessary semantic distinctions and to remain clear about what they are doing. In the case of Bacon, while he was ignorant of objectivity as a distinctive term, certain aspects of the concept were nevertheless familiar to him in other language. Thus he was thoroughly acquainted with objectivity in the sense of impartiality as one of the requirements of truth and justice in both law and history, and sought to practise it himself in his activities as a judge, a writer on jurisprudence and a historian.8 An awareness of objectivity is no less implicit in his discussion of the affiliation between rhetoric and the 6 Scholastic and neoscholastic thinkers distinguished the conceptus objectivus from the conceptus formalis, which denoted an object that is solely in the mind and thus has only an intellectual existence; see the excellent discussion by Michael Ayers, 'Ideas and objective being', in The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Philosophy (ed. Daniel Garber and Michael Ayers), 2 vols., Cambridge, 1998, ii, Chapter 30, and the remarks on the terminological and intellectual ancestry of the modern idea of objectivity in Peter Dear, 'From truth to disinterestedness in the seventeenth century', Social Studies of Science (1992), 22, 619-31; and Lorraine Daston, 'Objectivity and the escape from perspective', in ibid., 597-618. 7 See the discussion in Daston, op. cit. (6). The first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary had no separate entry for 'objectivity' and cited it only in connection with the definition of 'objective'. The second edition lists it separately with the following brief definition: 'The quality or character of being objective; external reality; objectiveness.' It is striking that there is also no separate entry for 'objectivity' in such major works of reference as the Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the Dictionary of the History of Ideas, the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the old Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences and its successor the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 8 I have discussed Bacon's treatment of these subjects in my book, Francis Bacon, Princeton, 1998, 187-220.</page><page sequence="4">382 Perez Zagorin imagination and of the latter's role as an instrument of both reason and passion.9 It is also a prominent feature of the political reflections and comments on worldly problems and the architecture of fortune contained in his essays, in which his mastery of objectivity in the decipherment of human designs and political stratagems is akin to that of Tacitus and Machiavelli.'" When he observes in The Advancement of Learning 'that we are much beholden to Machiavel and others, that write what men do and not what they ought to do', he is praising the Italian thinker for his realism and objectivity as an analyst of political conduct." But it was in his natural philosophy or theory of science and the investigation of nature that Bacon addressed the question of objectivity as a methodological problem most fully and directly, and with an originality that went well beyond preceding understandings of the concept. Students of Bacon's thought, however, have generally failed to give his treatment of this subject the attention it deserves.12 To this comment, though, there are two exceptions, the first an essay by Lorraine Daston, the second a recent book by Julie Robin Solomon, each of which attempts to explain the Baconian view of objectivity.'3 It was Daston who first introduced the question of objectivity into the discussion of Bacon's natural philosophy as a part of her wide-ranging project of investigating the history and evolution of the principle of objectivity in the natural sciences.'4 In her view, his idea of objectivity centred on the new significance his natural philosophy ascribed to facts, independent of all theories or interpretations, as the core of knowledge. 'Seventeenth- century objectivity', she states, 'insofar as one can use the word for this period without anachronism, was about facts and nothing but the facts'."5 Taking note of Bacon's conviction that natural history as collections of particular facts must provide the indispensable basis of natural philosophy, she sees in him the 'pivotal figure in the rehabilitation of facts as knowledge';"6 she further observes that under his influence 9 Zagorin, op. cit.

Heath), Works, 15 vols., Cambridge, MA, 1863, vi, 327. 12 The present writer's recent book, Francis Bacon, touched on the subject only briefly and inadequately (Zagorin, op. cit. (8), 82-6 ), and it has likewise been neglected in the important studies by Peter Urbach, Francis Bacon's Philosophy of Science: An Account and a Reappraisal, La Salle, IL, 1987, and Antonio Perez-Ramos, Francis Bacon's Idea of Science and the Maker's Knowledge Tradition, Oxford, 1988, the latter of which is probably the most significant contribution in recent years to the historical understanding of Bacon's theory of science. Objectivity is also not mentioned in any of the essays in The Cambridge Companion to Bacon (ed. Markku Peltonen), Cambridge, 1996. 13 Lorraine Daston, 'Baconian facts, academic civility, and the prehistory of objectivity', Annals of Scholarship (1991), 8, 337-63; Julie Robin Solomon, Objectivity in the Making: Francis Bacon and the Politics of Inquiry, Baltimore, 1998. Mary Tiles and Jim Tiles, in their An Introduction to Historical Epistemology: The Authority of Knowledge, Oxford, 1993, Chapter 2, also include some comments on Bacon's idea of objectivity, but it is not the focal point of their discussion. 14 Daston's other essays in this project include 'Objectivity and the escape from perspective' (op. cit. (6)); 'Fear and loathing of the imagination in science', Daedalus (1998), 127, 73-95; and in collaboration with Peter Galison, 'The image of objectivity', Representations (1992) 40, 81-128. I have also had the benefit of seeing Daston's unpublished 1993 article, 'The moralized objectivities of nineteenth-century science'. 15 Daston, op. cit. (13), 338. 16 Daston, op. cit. (13), 345.</page><page sequence="5">Francis Bacon's concept of objectivity 383 subsequent English natural philosophers like Robert Boyle believed that absence of bias and scientific impartiality depended on the avoidance of theories and the concentration upon and allegiance to facts conceived as sheer theory-free empirical posits.'7 In this way, Daston holds, 'Baconian facts' became 'the premier objects of objectivity' and likewise served to define the relationship between objectivity and impartiality in later seventeenth- century science.'8 In my summary of Daston's essay, I have not done justice to some of its interesting and suggestive comments. Its analysis of Bacon's conception of objectivity, however, is seriously incomplete and also unbalanced in the view it presents of Bacon's natural philosophy. While it is true that in the latter he attached great significance to the collection of facts, he is mistakenly represented, as a number of scholars including the present writer have shown, when pictured, as he is in Daston's story, as a pure empiricist who equated knowledge simply with facts and left no room for theories in the practice of science.'9 Moreover, although his emphasis on facts as a vital part of natural philosophy may have been an influential aspect of his legacy to the succeeding generation of English natural philosophers, his understanding of objectivity, if we are willing to attribute such a concept to him, included a good deal more than this and was considerably deeper and more interesting than Daston's discussion enables us to realize. Solomon's book, which is premised on the assumption that objectivity has been overthrown as a norm of scientific knowledge, defines it as ' self-distancing' and 'disinterestedness' or, more explicitly, 'the holding in abeyance, or erasure, of the individual mind's desires, interests, assumptions, and intents while that mind is in the process of knowing the material world '*20 Claiming to show how 'class' and 'occupational positions inflect the production of culture and ideology', it maintains that Bacon's version of objectivity was an ideological offspring of the commercial and mercantile capitalism of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as the socio-economic context for the emergence of the strategies of self-distancing and objective calculation.2' Unhappily, however, despite its pretensions, this work is unable to establish any actual connection between the character of Bacon's philosophy and his supposed class affiliation.22 Not only does it fail to provide an adequate or detailed examination of the writings that can be related to his conception 17 Daston, op. cit. (13), 345-56. 18 Daston, op. cit. (13), 350, 356. For the importance assigned to facts in Bacon's natural philosophy and its influence upon seventeenth-century science in adopting norms of impartiality and fidelity to facts as both a methodological necessity and an essential part of scientific discourse, see Barbara Shapiro, A Culture of Fact, Ithaca, 2000. 19 See Urbach, op. cit.

Both his father Sir Nicholas Bacon and his uncle William Cecil, Lord Burghley, were self-made men who rose to wealth and high position in the service of the Tudor monarchy, acquired titles, country houses and estates, and established themselves as members of the Tudor aristocracy. Their sons all belonged to the aristocratic sector of society. The interest Bacon took in commercial policy and trade was typical of the statesmen of his period, who looked upon trade as an important element of national power.</page><page sequence="6">384 Perez Zagorin of objectivity, but by equating his understanding of the latter with 'philosophic self- distancing'23 it also overlooks new and major aspects of the meaning of objectivity which are traceable in his theory of science.24 Bacon's foremost goal as a philosopher was the attainment of a new logic of discovery in the investigation of nature that would greatly enhance human cognitive power and assure the continual progress of the sciences and the growth of knowledge. His conception of objectivity is entirely bound up with this end. This conception is formulated most completely in his Novum Organum (The New Organon), published in 1620 as the second part of his Instauratio Magna (The Great Instauration). Never finished but designed to consist of six parts, The Great Instauration was Bacon's title for the most ambitious project of his intellectual life, his plan for the reconstruction and renewal of philosophy and the study of nature.25 As a preamble to the exposition of his new logic of discovery based on a reformed induction, which occupies the second book of The New Organon, he devoted the first book to a critique of preceding philosophical doctrines and systems and to pointing out the defects of current methods of enquiry and their causes. The entire discussion in the first book was thus intended to expose the various obstacles that had hitherto blocked the progress of mankind's knowledge of nature. Bacon regarded this prior critique as a therapeutic necessity which would help to purge the understanding of his readers so that it would be cleansed and receptively prepared for the discussion to follow, a discussion centring on induction as a discovery procedure.26 In his survey of the obstacles to the growth of knowledge, the most formidable were those he called the idols of the mind (idola intellectus). It is in his analysis of these idols, rather than in the importance he assigned to the accurate compilation of facts, that we find the strongest evidence of his understanding of objectivity and his most distinctive and significant contribution to its realization in the practice of science. It is no doubt true that as encapsulated in the familiar phrase 'the idols of the mind', Bacon 's account of the idols is among the best-known parts of his philosophy. As a concept profoundly relevant to his view of objectivity, however, it has been almost entirely overlooked. For this reason we are obliged to re-examine what he says on this subject in order to see what it conveys about the place of objectivity in his natural philosophy. In dealing with this matter, I think it may help us to perceive what Bacon was trying to do if we pause for a moment to notice the profound difference between how the question of objectivity presents itself today and the way it appeared in Bacon's time. Nowadays objectivity is a highly contested concept in the philosophy and sociology of science and other disciplines and is strongly attacked by critics who deny that it is either attainable or 23 Solomon, op. cit. (13), p. xii. 24 See also the critical reviews of Solomon's book by Brian Vickers, Isis (1999), 90, 594-5; and Robert K. Faulkner, American Historical Review (1999), 104, 987-8. Among its faults, both authors note its failure to analyse or clarify Bacon's theories and its questionable arguments like its explanation of Baconian objectivity as an ideology and the creed of the rising bourgeoisie. 25 On The Great Instauration and its plan and character, see Zagorin, op. cit.

Most of these critics, whatever their differences, tend to share a common relativism about knowledge and truth, which they reduce to collective belief, disciplinary and community agreement and conventions of language. Taking objectivity to postulate an impossible value-free, neutral or aperspectival position in the process of knowing, they see it as a product of the illusion that scientific knowledge is not a human and social construction but something simply discovered and 21 true. Opposed to this view are the numerous philosophers who reject epistemological relativism and defend the principle of objectivity as a valid cognitive standard, guiding ideal and essential requisite of scientific and other enquiry.28 For them, objectivity entails that truth is universal rather than relative to social position or cultural membership and, moreover, that scientists and other investigators are sufficiently capable of transcending their personal and cultural background, beliefs and prejudices to arrive at valid knowledge and objective truth.29 The problem confronting the idea of objectivity in contemporary thought may thus be described as chiefly the consequence of some version of relativism which serves as the common ground for objectivity's critics. In Bacon's time, however, relativism in the several forms it has assumed today was not available as a real philosophical option. The sociology of knowledge and theory of ideology did not exist, the status of truth as an ideal and as the goal of knowledge remained largely unquestioned, and the possibility of impartiality in moral deliberation, the administration of law and the writing of history was generally not denied. Early modern philosophers knew of course about some of the relativistic doctrines of the sophists which are reported in the dialogues of Plato, but these seem to have exerted little influence. In his theory of science, Bacon himself disagreed with the dictum of the celebrated sophist Protagoras, which Plato quoted in his Theaetetus, that 'man is the measure of all things', because he held that men need to accommodate their thoughts to the measure of the universe rather than to their own predilections.30 The nearest resemblance to modern relativism in Bacon's world was the philosophy of ancient Academic and especially Pyrrhonian scepticism, revived in the sixteenth century, which produced arguments doubting the possibility of certain knowledge and truth. Scepticism of 27 The essays contained in Rethinking Objectivity (Megill, op. cit. (2)) provide a good sample of contemporary criticisms of objectivity in science and other disciplines; see among others Kenneth Gergen, 'The mechanical self and the rhetoric of objectivity'; Lorraine Code, 'Who cares? The poverty of objectivism for moral epistemology'; and Evelyn Fox Keller, 'The paradox of scientific subjectivity'. 28 Among the philosophic opponents of epistemological relativism and defenders of objectivity are Karl Popper, 'The rationality of scientific revolutions' and 'The myth of the framework', in idem, The Myth of The Framework, London, 1994; Israel Scheffler, Science and Subjectivity, 2nd edn., Indianapolis, 1982; Thomas Nagel, The View from Nowhere, New York, 1986; idem, The Last Word, New York, 1997; Nicholas Rescher, Objectivity: The Obligations of Impersonal Reason, Notre Dame, IN, 1997; Larry Laudan, Science and Relativism, Chicago, 1990; Philip Kitcher, The Advancement of Science, New York, 1993; Susan Haack, Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate, Chicago, 1998. 29 This last statement must be qualified in the case of Popper's anti-relativism, since he always maintained that it is impossible to know if a theory is true and that the measure of a scientific theory is not its truth but its ability to resist falsification. 30 Plato, Theaetetus, 160d; Although Bacon nowhere mentions Protagoras, one of the essential themes of his natural philosophy, often stated in The New Organon, is that men must adjust their thoughts to the measure of the universe.</page><page sequence="8">386 Perez Zagorin several types was an important trend in early modern philosophy and its representatives included such noted thinkers as Montaigne, Charron, Gassendi, Pascal and Bayle, as well as many lesser figures.31 In Bacon's case, though, albeit he was a great doubter and questioner of particular knowledge claims, he never attached much weight to the challenge of the sceptical philosophy and always maintained that knowledge could be firmly established and continually enlarged. If he had happened to be acquainted with Montaigne's sceptical comment that what is true on one side of the mountain is false on the other, he gave no indication that he took this view seriously.32 When discussing scepticism, he mentioned in particular the doctrine of akatalepsz'a, the inability of the mind to know anything, which he explained had been made into a dogma by the later disciples of Plato in the New Academy.33 He charged the sceptics with making 'a cult of the incomprehensibility of nature' and promoting 'a deliberate and artificial despair' concerning the acquisition of knowledge. What later came to be termed epistemology, the branch of philosophy concerned with whether and how knowledge is possible, was not for him a genuine problem, and he was not troubled by the deceptions of the senses and other arguments sceptics advanced as reasons against the attainability of truth. He was convinced that all the impediments to knowledge, including those due to the weakness of the senses, could be overcome by the intellect when supplied with the proper helps and a method for dealing with the subtleties of nature.34 What all of this means is that in his reflections on what we now call objectivity Bacon did not need to worry about providing an answer to relativism. Instead he was entirely preoccupied with the specific problems he perceived as hindrances to the advancement of knowledge and the implementation of objectivity in the sciences. This is the principal context in which his discussion of the idols of the mind should be read. He had previously touched upon the idols in several of his earliest writings and also given them some attention in The Advancement of Learning, published in 1605, his most important philosophical treatise prior to The New Organon. In a comment in the former work on the deficiency of human judgement, he used a striking optical metaphor to observe that 'the mind of man is far from the nature of a clear and equal glass, wherein the beams of things should reflect according to their true incidence; nay, it is rather like an enchanted glass, full of 31 See the survey by Charles Larmore, 'Scepticism', and the literature there cited, in The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Philosophy (ed. Daniel Garber and Michael Ayers), 2 vols., Cambridge, 1998, ii, Chapter 32, and Stephen Gaukroger's discussion of ancient and sixteenth-century scepticism and relativism in Descartes: An Inellectual Biography, Oxford, 1995, 311-16. 32 Bacon had read some of Montaigne's Essais. The observation mentioned in the text comes from his Apologie de Raimond Sebond, Essais, Book II, 12, a classic argument and collection of examples intended to prove that the human mind can know nothing with certainty. 33 Bacon, op. cit.

His introduction of the idols was related to this purpose. A word anglicized from the Greek ei'dolon and the Latin idolum, the idols Bacon scrutinized did not refer to false gods that are worshipped, but to phantoms, false appearances, fictions, delusive images, illusions, prejudices, fallacies and false notions. In their impact on thought, some of the idols were the result of external influences, while others sprang from certain innate propensities of the human mind. Their importance lay in the fact that their effect extended far beyond particular mistakes to the entire warping and misdirection of the intelligence. By identifying them and their operation, Bacon sought to uncover the deep-seated and often unconscious sources of misconception, irrationality and error that barred the way to a true understanding of nature. He found a comparison to them in Aristotle's De Sophisticis Elenchis or Sophistical Refutations, noting that 'the doctrine of the idols is to the interpretation of nature what the doctrine of the refutation of sophisms is to common logic'.3 While Aristotle's treatise, however, was concerned with the description of logical fallacies or sophisms, Bacon's examination of the idols ranged more widely in order to identify the mental, psychological and socially engendered dispositions and beliefs that were responsible for systematic distortion and error. Bacon divided the idols of the mind into four categories. The first, the idols of the tribe ('idola tribus'), were rooted in human nature and hence common to mankind. These were the errors to which human beings were innately prone, and caused men to look on the universe as if it were formed according to their own measure and by analogy to themselves. Among the consequences Bacon attributed to the idols of the tribe were the mind's assumption of greater order and regularity in the world than is actually the case; its perception of fictitious analogies and parallels for phenomena in nature; its tendency, after adopting an opinion, to maintain it with the aid of continual rationalizations despite the existence of countervailing evidence, a practice to which was due all the superstition in astrology, dreams, omens and impressions of divine judgments; its attraction to positive rather than negative instances, even though the latter are the stronger force in the establishment of true axioms; and its disposition to fall back on final causes as explanations, a practice that defiled philosophy and accorded more with human nature 35 Francis Bacon, The Advancement of Learning, Works, vi, 276. The word 'reduced' in this context means 'corrected' and is related to the Latin term 'reductio' in Bacon's preface to Novum Organum, ibid., i, 234, on which see also the editor's note, ibid. 36 Francis Bacon, The Great Instauration, Works, viii, 32. In the plan of The Great Instauration, after stressing the necessity of 'keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature' so as to receive their images 'simply as they are', he made the comment, 'For God forbid that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of the world'; ibid., 'Plan of the work', 53. 37 Bacon, op. cit.

All these errors, Bacon believed, were traceable to the inveterate anthropocentrism with which human beings projected onto nature and the world the patterns of their own instinctual thinking. His analysis went further still, however, in observing that the human understanding, far from being a 'dry light', was strongly affected by the will and passions. Hence there come into being what he termed 'wishful sciences' ('ad quod vult scientias'), because 'what man wishes were true he more readily believes' ('quod enim mavult homo verum esse, id potius credit').38 Yet another effect of these same idols was the intellect's inclination to reify abstractions by attributing substance and reality to things in flux. But of the many aberrations they produced, the greatest of all, he considered, were the incompetence and deceptions of the senses, which were weak and erring when left to themselves. Owing to their weakness, many things in nature remained unobserved; in this connection Bacon maintained that a truer interpretation of nature could be achieved by appropriate experiments, since in these the senses judged only the experiment while it was the latter that decided the point of nature in respect to things themselves.39 The second category of the idols, those of the cave ('idola specus'), were errors due to the peculiarities and variety of impressions of each particular individual, every one of whom dwelt in his own cave, which refracted and distorted the light of nature. Under their influence, men became attached to particular sciences and speculations in obedience to their fancies. Thus Aristotle enslaved the study of nature to the syllogism and the alchemists based their philosophy on a few experiments. Some minds noticed differences, others looked for analogies; some venerated antiquity, others loved novelty - attitudes equally injurious to science. As an antidote to the idols of the cave, Bacon proposed that students of nature follow the rule that whenever their minds seized upon something with special satisfaction, they should consider it suspect and take special care to keep their minds balanced and clear.40 The most troublesome of the idols, according to Bacon, were the ones in the third category, the idols of the marketplace ('idola fori'), which stemmed from the deceits of language. Although people supposed that reason governs words, the opposite was also true, that words govern reason and give rise to innumerable empty controversies and fictions. As a result learned men have disputed merely about words and names, an evil that not even definitions could cure, since they themselves were words and begat more words. These idols also misled the understanding in two ways: they gave confused, ill-defined names to things that exist, and they gave names to unreal things like Fortune, Prime Mover, Orbits of the Planets ('Planetarum Orbes'),41 Element of Fire and other fictions that owed their origin to false and idle theories ('quae a vanis et falsis theoriis ortum habent'). In 38 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 82, or Book I, aphorism xlix. 39 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 79-83, or Book I, aphorisms xlv-li. 40 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 77, 84-6, or Book I, aphorisms xlii, liii-lviii. 41 I am not sure whether the reference to 'Orbits' in the English translation of this phrase is correct, although it also appears in the translation in Spedding's edition, viii, 87, or Book I, aphorism lx. It has been suggested to me that by Orbes Bacon may have meant the fictitious spheres on which the planets were thought to revolve; or possibly the word signified 'circles', one of its possible meanings, since he regarded as false the belief that celestial bodies move in perfect circles; ibid. 79, or Book I, aphorism xlv. When speaking of circles in Novum Organum, however, he used the word circulus.</page><page sequence="11">Francis Bacon's concept of objectivity 389 Bacon's opinion it was much easier to expel the second of these errors by getting rid of bad theories than to eliminate the first, which was deeply rooted, complicated and due to faulty, incompetent abstraction.42 Finally, in the fourth category were the idols of the theatre ('idola theatri'), consisting of the different dogmas that migrated into human minds from false systems of philosophy, false demonstrations in logic and false principles and axioms in the sciences and which gave rise, like stage plays, to fictions and unreal worlds. Bacon devoted his lengthiest strictures to this class of idols, criticizing various philosophies for their deficiencies and errors. The Rationalist school, for example, applied meditation and ingenuity of wit to a small amount of uncritically accepted experience. The Empirical school, to which the alchemists belonged, constructed vain and incredible systems out of a few experiments, wresting facts to make them conform with its conclusions. The Superstitious school, which included Pythagoras and Plato, mixed theology with philosophy to the detriment of each. Aristotle, whom Bacon placed with the Sophistical school, corrupted natural philosophy with his logic, fashioning the world out of categories, and although he made some experiments, actually reached his conclusions beforehand and failed to consult experience. Bacon cautioned against the intemperance with which philosophical systems either give or withhold their assent: those too ready in deciding caused the sciences to be dogmatic and magisterial, while the others, who denied the possibility of knowledge, pursued enquiries that led to nothing. He indicted 'vicious demonstrations' ('pravae demonstrationes') in logic,43 whose effect was to make the world the slave of thought and thought the slave of words. He found fault with these demonstrations for various reasons: their use of faulty sense impressions and of notions ill drawn from the senses; their reliance on a bad kind of induction that infers the principles of the sciences by simple enumeration; and their mode of discovery and proof by first establishing the most general principles and then deriving intermediate axioms, a procedure he denounced as 'the parent of all error and the curse of all science'."' In opposition to these practices, he maintained that the best demonstration was experience provided it did not go beyond the experiment, because unless a transfer to other cases deemed similar was done in a correct and orderly way, the result would be fallacious. And he felt forced to state that the method currently used in making experiments was blind and stupid.45 Bacon was convinced that the idols in all four categories had to be renounced and eliminated as far as possible in order to free the human understanding.46 To be sure, in reviewing them, he based many of his criticisms on his own natural or experimental philosophy with its belief in a reformed induction, which he took as a standard. Moreover, his disparaging and destructive comments on the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle, and other philosophers whose influence he wished to overthrow, were heavily biased by his own 42 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 78, 86-9, or Book I, aphorisms xlii, lix-lx. 43 Bacon, op. cit. (42), 99, or Book I, aphorism lxix. 44 Bacon, op. cit. (42), 100, or Book I, aphorism lxix. 45 Bacon, op. cit. (42), 78, 90-100, or Book I, aphorisms xliv, lxii-lxx. 46 Bacon, op. cit. (42), 99, or Book I, aphorism lxviii. In the plan of The Great Instauration he expressed the view that the first two classes of idols were hard to eradicate and the other two classes could not be eradicated at all. The most that could be done with the latter, he said, was to point them out so that their insidious effect on the mind could be identified and overcome; ibid., 45.</page><page sequence="12">390 Perez Zagorin polemical purpose and failed to do them justice. In the main, nevertheless, his overriding aim was to reveal the aberrations and failures of intelligence wrought by the idols' sway. What he attacked in the idols' effect upon the mind were animism, anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism, unreal abstract entities and human wish projections and delusions that saw in the universe the reflection of their own image and desires. He endeavoured to teach the mind to be aware of its own naive and spontaneous operations, to help it to overcome its prejudiced, self-centred assumptions and beliefs, and to enable it to gain an objective rationality and standpoint as an essential prerequisite for the advancement of knowledge of nature. If we attempt to define the conception of objectivity underlying and implicit in Bacon's analysis of the idols, we should have to say that it means a mental attitude and type of enquiry that leads to true knowledge and understanding of the world and the phenomena of nature and their causes. It does not seem to carry with it any implication of disinterestedness, cognitive self-distancing or the suppression of subjectivity or the self.47 As he conceived of it, the consciousness and identification of the idols, along with the attempt to banish their influence, was equivalent to a reorientation, redirection and widening of the mind, the achievement of a new clarity and a rectified perspective in the interests of scientific understanding and its productive results. For Bacon this reorientation was not incompatible with such strong cognitive emotions as passion and ambition in enquiry, pleasure and gratification in contributing to the increase of knowledge, and happiness in scientific discovery.48 Bacon is famed for his conviction that knowledge brings power and his insistence that the production of works of all kinds for the relief of the human condition is the proper end of knowledge. Nevertheless, he was always consistent in regarding truth as the highest goal of scientific enquiry from which works would be sure to follow. In his natural philosophy he often compared truth to light and placed it above any other earthly good.49 The thoughts and feelings which he associated with the quest for truth as a supreme human value are eloquently stated in his essay on truth: 'the inquiry of truth, which is the love-making and wooing of it, the knowledge of truth, which is the presence of it, and the belief of truth, which is the enjoying of it, is the sovereign good of human nature'.50 47 One recent scholar's reading of Bacon's philosophy is that 'the inductive method is a machine that displaces the faculty of choice' and, in reference to the idols, that 'to advance in learning is to mortify the minds of inquirers so that they see and perform the works of truth'; see John C. Briggs, Francis Bacon and the Rhetoric of Nature, Cambridge, MA., 1989, 9, 15. I have not succeeded in finding any warrant for these characterizations in what Bacon wrote. Nowhere in his discussion of the idols does he suggest that the mortification of the mind is necessary to eliminate or reduce their influence. In the preface to The New Organon he refers to machinery when, after insisting on the need for a fresh start in the work of understanding, he comments that the mind must be guided at every step and 'the business done as if by machinery' ('ac res veluti per machinas conficiatur'). As its context immediately makes clear, however, this statement does not imply a mechanical or machine-like conception of the mind or the denial of its faculty of choice. Thus he goes on to say that just as the mechanical arts have not relied for their achievements only on the naked hands but sought the help of instruments, so in intellectual matters the mind cannot rely solely on the naked forces of the understanding but needs instruments and machinery to accomplish great works. His essential point is that induction is such an instrument; Bacon, op. cit. (26), 61-2, preface. 48 See Scheffler, op. cit. (28), Appendix B, 'In praise of the cognitive emotions'. 49 See Zagorin, op. cit. (8), 88-9. 50 Bacon, 'Of truth', Essays, Works, xii, 82.</page><page sequence="13">Francis Bacon's concept of objectivity 391 The misapprehension that objectivity for Bacon centred on the supremacy he assigned to facts is closely connected with the mistaken image we continue to have of him as a pure empiricist who wished to divorce science from theories, hypotheses and interpretations. Natural history, which he designated as part three of The Great Instauration, occupied a vital place in his philosophy of science because the facts it supplied on various topics were to provide the data upon which induction would operate. In the instructions, however, that he drew up for the writing of natural histories, he did not envisage them as indiscriminate accumulations of facts. They were intended in principle to consist of critically sifted information on particular subjects whose collection would be steadily directed by the investigator's questions, enriched by experiments and controlled by the aim of facilitating induction. Their chief purpose, moreover, was to aid in the formation of axioms.51 Bacon condemned the syllogistic demonstration of Aristotelian natural philosophy for leaping at once 'from particulars to remote axioms' of the highest generality, including first principles, and then erroneously treating these principles as unshakeable truths which it used to prove middle-range axioms; whereas the correct procedure, he argued, would be to ascend successively from particulars to lesser axioms to intermediate axioms and finally to the most general.52 He also decried 'anticipations of nature' ('anticipationes naturae'), by which phrase he did not mean hypotheses, as has been supposed, but the practice of rash and premature generalizations based on a few familiar instances.53 In Bacon's scheme, axioms as a higher and more generalized level of knowledge that leads to an operative science, not facts, are the principal fruit and main achievement he expected from his method.54 He was also quite explicit that the axioms established by induction must cover more than the particulars from which they were derived; they should be 'wider and larger' and capable of indicating 'new particulars' that would serve to confirm them.55 Axioms thus functioned in Bacon's philosophy as theories and hypotheses to lead to the discovery of new facts, suggest further experiments and generate new axioms. His recognition of the continual interaction between experiment and theory is well conveyed in the following declaration in The New Organon: 'my method ['via et ratio'], as I have often clearly stated ... is this, not to extract works from works or experiments from experiments (like the empirics), but from works and experiments to extract causes and axioms, and again 51 Francis Bacon, A Preparative toward a Natural and Experimental History (Parasceve ad Historiam Naturalem et Experimentalem), Works, viii; the Latin original is in ibid., ii. Bacon included this treatise in the same volume as The New Organon; see also the discussion of Baconian natural history in Zagorin, op. cit. (8), 103-6. 52 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 137-8, or Book I, aphorism civ. 53 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 73-4, or Book I, aphorisms xxvi-xxx. Karl Popper erroneously supposed that the anticipations of nature' Bacon criticized were the same as hypotheses; see his The Logic of Discovery, London, 1975, 279 n., and Conjectures and Refutations, New York, 1962, 255. 54 I have shown elsewhere that Bacon refrained from using the word 'methodus' or 'method' to describe his logic of discovery based upon induction and the reasons why he did so; see Zagorin, op. cit. (8), 51-7. As pointed out in ibid. and likewise noted below, instead of methodus, he preferred such phrases as via et ratio for his discovery procedure. It is convenient, however, and need not lead to misunderstanding, to follow the terminology of the English translation in Spedding's edition of Bacon's Works, and refer to Baconian induction as his method; see, e.g., Bacon, op. cit. (26), 61, 63 (preface), 74, 159, or Book I, aphorisms xxxiii, cxxvii. 55 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 139, or Book I, aphorism cvi.</page><page sequence="14">392 Perez Zagorin from those causes and axioms new works and experiments, as a legitimate interpreter of nature '.56 Finally, in this connection, it is worth noticing the presence of the word 'interpreter' ('interpretes') in the above passage and the prominence in Bacon's philosophy of what he called 'interpretation' ('interpretatio'). Interpres in classical Latin signified an explainer, a translator, an interpreter, and interpretatio referred to an explanation or interpretation. The derivations of both words were also part of the English language in Bacon's time. Deeply conscious of nature's subtlety and its many unobserved and unobservable operations, Bacon did not think the understanding of nature, or what we would call scientific explanation and the discovery of laws of nature, consisted in the establishment and registration of particular facts. He always conceived of such explanation as a work of interpretation in which the facts contributed by natural history were certainly essential but also ancillary. The New Organon is subtitled Aphorisms Concerning the Interpretation of Nature and the Kingdom of Man, ('Aphorismi de Interpretatione Naturae et Regno Hominis'),57 and its very first sentence depicts 'man' as 'the servant and interpreter of nature' ('Homo, naturae minister et interpres'). Other writings contain the phrase 'the interpretation of nature' in their titles,58 and the word 'interpretatio' occurs quite frequently in his reflections on science. By 'interpretation' he usually referred to his method of induction as the basis for explaining the workings of nature. 'That reason which is elicited from things by a just and methodical process', he said, 'I am accustomed to call the Interpretation of Nature', ('illam rationem quae debitis modis elicitur a rebus Interpretationem Naturae ... vocare consuevimus'), and he described 'true and legitimate induction as the very key of interpretation' ('Inductio legitima et vera, quae ipsa clavis est interpretationis').59 Hence in Book II of The New Organon, when he comes to expound his 'directions for the interpretation of nature', he says they embrace 'two generic divisions; the one how to educe and form axioms from experience; the other how to deduce and derive new experiments from axioms'. 60 Statements like these appear to leave no doubt that in Bacon's natural philosophy, interpretation as a reliance on a properly designed induction for the attainment of axioms necessarily included theories and was conceived of as a theoretical enterprise. Bacon's analysis of the idols of the mind seems to have little if any precedent in the work of previous thinkers and is one of his most significant contributions to the philosophy of science, although its originality has not always been recognized or understood.61 Michael 56 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 148, or Book I, aphorism cxvii. 57 For the significance of Bacon's idea of the kingdom of man, see Zagorin, op. cit. (8), 77-9. 58 See, for example, Bacon, Valerius Terminus of the Interpretation of Nature, Works, vi, a work written in English; De Interpretatione Naturae Proemium (Proemium on the Interpretation of Nature), ibid., vii; Cogitata et Visa; de Interpretatione Naturae, sive de Scientia Operativa (Thoughts and Conclusions on The Interpretation of Nature or An Operative Science), in ibid. 59 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 73, 179, or Book I, aphorism xxvi; Book. II, aphorism x; see also the preface to this work, ibid., 64, in which Bacon stated that he has chosen to call his method or way the 'Interpretation of nature'. 60 Bacon, op. cit. (26), 178, or Book II, aphorism x. 61 In his preface to Novum Organum, Bacon's learned editor, Robert L. Ellis, examined the possibility that Bacon had borrowed his classification of the idols from his thirteenth-century namesake Roger Bacon, whose Opus Maius included an account of four offendicula or causes of error impeding the road to knowledge. Ellis saw little similarity between Francis Bacon's discussion of the idols and the work by Roger Bacon, and also noted that</page><page sequence="15">Francis Bacon's concept of objectivity 393 Ayers, writing on the theory of knowledge in the recent Cambridge History of Seventeenth- Century Philosophy, goes far astray in commenting on the idols that 'Bacon's list of intellectual vices appears as a polemic aimed at philosophical and religious enemies rather than as a general natural history of human unreasonableness and cognitive failure'. 62 The identification and explanation of some of the main causes of human unreasonableness and cognitive failure is exactly what Bacon's discussion of the idols is all about. No other philosopher of the seventeenth century tried to explore the sources of error in science with more care, or showed greater awareness and understanding of what we can retrospectively recognize as the problem of objectivity, or tried harder to devise constructive suggestions for the achievement of objectivity in the conduct of enquiry. the former could not have known Opus Maius, which was not printed until the nineteenth century. His conclusion was that Bacon's conception of the idols was 'altogether his own'; Bacon, op. cit. (11), i, 158-9. Fowler, who also considers this subject in his edition of Novum Organum, 212-13, is in accord with Ellis and observes that the resemblance between the offendicula and the idols is very slight. 62 Michael Ayers, 'Theories of knowledge and belief', The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-Century Philosophy (ed. Daniel Garber and Michael Ayers), 2 vols., Cambridge, 1998, ii, 1044. Another misunderstanding is John C. Briggs's confusion of the idols with idolatry and his claim that Bacon's discussion of the idols regarded opposition to the new sciences as 'idolatrous heresies' which must be 'smashed'. 'Bacon's science and religion', The Cambridge Companion to Bacon (ed. Markku Peltonen), Cambridge, 1996, 177-8.</page></plain_text>
