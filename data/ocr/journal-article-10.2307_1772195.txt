<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE On Franz Stanzel's Theorie des Erzihlens DORRIT COHN Germanic Languages, Harvard INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS The discourse on narrative discourse is still in Babel. Its categories are vari- ously labeled (narrative) perspective, mode, distance, person, register, presen- tation, situation, point of view, aspect, focalization, field, position, voice, transmission, vision. Its domain is divided in two, three, four, six, eight, twelve. Its models slide along linear scales, square off two-dimensionally, fork into family trees, slice into strata, tabulate and formularize by distinctive features. Not to mention other banes to comparison and communication: "real" language barriers, divergent (sometimes alien) corpora, unfamiliar refer- ential frames, arcane theoretical bases. Whether Stanzel's new Theorie des Erziahlens will - after translation into French and English' - bring us closer to a consensus remains to be seen. There are several reasons why it promises to do so: Stanzel's corpus (primarily English and German, eighteenth to twentieth century) is wide, and will be familiar to most students of narrative. His referential frame is international and impressively up to date. His theoretical base is formalistic, genre-specific - only occasionally bolstered by linguistic and philosophical concepts. Most important of all: the capaciousness of his system is such that it allows him to integrate the theoretical approaches of his principal predecessors, and further- more allows his reader to correlate it with those systems which, for one reason of another, Stanzel does not himself conjugate with his own. In this sense Theorie des Erziihlens has the potential for subsuming, and perhaps even for superceding, the theoretical developments of the last two decades in this area. It is at any rate an answer - if not the answer - to the call by Wolfgang Haubrichs for "a phase of reconstruction to follow the reductionist phase of analysis" (1976:21).

It refers to its antecedents from within a highly integrated, internally consistent system that refines and elaborates a self-made model first conceived twenty-five years ago, and published under the title Die typischen Erzaihlsituationen im Roman (Stanzel, 1955). This model, which became immensely influential in Germany,2 has been very largely dis- missed (or ignored) by narratologists in other countries - even after its be- lated translation into English (Stanzel, 1971). The reason is, clearly, that its syncretic titular concept, "narrative situation," was misunderstood as just another term for the old "point of view." This misunderstanding in turn led to the objection that Stanzel's typology lumped together problems of narrative perspective and narrative person (Genette, 1972:187-88; Tamir, 1976:417; Chatman, 1975:235-37; Bal, 1977:108). Closer reading would have revealed that Stanzel's three original narrative situations (authorial, figural, first-person) were not conceived as different "points of view," but as three ideal types, each of which differed from its two counterparts by a complex of several different distinctive features (now, in the new Theorie, clearly identified and labeled as the three, cardinal oppositions Mode, Person, and Perspective). When under- stood correctly, the nuclear typology of 1955 turns out to anticipate some basic ideas on narrative discourse developed by the Podtique group over a decade later, including the essential differentiation (universally credited to Genette) between vision and voice ("who sees?" versus "who speaks?"). Accordingly, those of us who had been working with Stanzel's system prior to the publication of Communications 8 in 1966 had something of a sense of ddja~ vu, perhaps even of Besserwissen, as we watched the flowering of this discourse-oriented branch of the nouvelle critique - admiration for its outstanding analytic skills, ele- gance, and lucidity notwithstanding. Questions of priority aside, I propose to keep an eye on French narratology, and particularly on G6rard Genette's Discourse on Narrative, as I examine Stanzel's new Theorie des Erziihlens. My aim is not only to bring Stanzel more fully into the international main stream, but also to cast a comparative light on the two culminating systems (to date) of French and German "low structuralism," as Robert Scholes (1974:157) has called this formalist orientation in the poetics of narrative. A number of differentia between the two works - in aim, ampli- tude, design - must be mentioned at the outset, together with a few more substantial points of comparative orientation. I take them up in order of increasing theoretical importance: 1. The object of Discourse is dual (Proust and narrative theory); when Proust is distilled out of its pages, a slim, highly condensed, not always explicitly connected theoretical text emerges: a brilliant armature of succinct, striking, sweeping conceptualizations. The object of Theorie is single, its 2Especially after the publication of its more popular sequel, Typische Formen des Erziihlens (Stanzel, 1964).</page><page sequence="3">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 159 theoretical grid positioned in toto from the start, then surveyed in three hundred pages of close-paced analysis, bolstered every inch of the way by a wealth of diverse textual paradigms. 2. Stanzel's theoretical purview is deliberately limited to narrative mediation (or, as he prefers to call it, mediacy). It thus corresponds only to the "figures" Genette treats in his two final chapters on Mode and Voice. The matters of temporal structure dealt with in the earlier chapters of Discourse enter Theorie only ad hoc, where they relate directly to problems of narrative mediation.3 Consequently the two theories are comparable solely in one arena - the one Mieke Bal has aptly called "the most intractable and 'narratological' in narra- tology" (Bal, 1977:105). 3. Even within this arena, Stanzel's focus is more restricted than Genette's. He pays scarcely any attention to the question of different "narrative levels" (niveaux narratifs) that plays such a capital role in Genette's Voice chapter. In this sense his typology can be called "plane" - or (to modify a Genettean term) uni-diegetic - which is surely not unrelated to its graphic representability. As we shall see, this exclusion of the depth dimension leads to certain difficul- ties on Stanzel's typological plane itself, where he disregards vocal changes that would call for a three-dimensional or "solid" model. 4. Though Genette's and Stanzel's aim is identical - to explore narrative form (sujet, disours) in its relation to narrative content (fabula, histoire) - their approach to this aim differs considerably. In simplest terms one can say that Genette's approach is more analytical, Stanzel's more synthetic. This is apparent already from their methodological starting points. Stanzel starts phenomenally, with the overriding characteristic of narrative form - "mediacy of presentation" (15). Genette starts by subdividing narrative form into two aspects: the formal process of signifying action ("narrating" of narration) and the formal product of signifier ("narrative" or rdcit) (1980:27). This subtle distinction is reinforced by the linguistic trope of the narrative text as a macrocosmic sentence uttered by a speaker (Voice) in a certain Manner (Mode) (1980:30-31). The implication of these differing departures for their narratological journeys is greater than appears at first sight. Stanzel's principal categories (Person, Mode, Perspective) are designed to account for the different forms that "mediacy of presentation" can take. They are thus conceived as analytic components of the syncretic phenomenon they shape in concert. As we shall see in a moment, Stanzel's typology of different forms of mediacy (or "narrative situations") results precisely from the systematic permutations of the binary oppositions that determine his three categories. Genette's categories (Mode, Voice, and their subdivisions), by contrast, tend to stand apart, cogent in themselves, but without systematic integration - with the gram- matical trope providing, if anything, additional inducement for treating 3This limitation is fully justified in the German context, where Eberhard Lammert's Bauformen des Erziihlens (1955) has long been a standard reference work on problems of temporal structure. There is, incidentally, a close correlation between Limmert's temporal conceptualizations and Genette's chapters of Order and Duration. The latter's chapter of Frequency, however, is a special (and outstanding) Genettean preserve.</page><page sequence="4">160 DORRIT COHN separately (as grammar books are wont to do) rather than for correlating them (cf. Rimmon's criticism of Genette on this score [1976:57]). 5. Genette's proclivity to categorical separation and Stanzel's to categorical correlation notwithstanding, their principal categories themselves tally re- markably well. This is true in spite of the discrepencies in terminology and grouping that tend to mask the correspondence at first reading. Closer examina- tion shows that they line up as in Chart I. Chart I STANZEL GENETTE Category Opposition Category Opposition Person First Person Voice: Person Homodiegetic vs. vs. Third Person Heterodiegetic Mode Narrator -Distance Diegesis vs. vs. Reflector Mode: Mimesis Perspective External P. -Focalization Zero+External F. vs. vs. Internal P. Internal F. As this chart shows, Stanzel separates into two distinct categories (Mode and Perspective) two concepts that Genette identifies as different components of his Mode (Distance and Focalization).4 Paradoxically, however, Stanzel inter- relates his Mode and Perspective far more closely than Genette does his Distance and Focalization. I shall argue, in fact, that Stanzel's perspectival opposition (External/Internal) corresponds so closely to his modal opposition (Narrator/Reflector) that this categorical separation is not fully justified in his system. 6. Genette's oppositions are, on the whole, sharper, more absolute, than Stanzel's. They define stable norms (or codes) whose infringement leads to "anomalies," "transgressions," even "scandals." Needless to say Genette's system is not normative in the usual sense of the word. His most interesting "figures" (paralepsis, paralipsis, metalepsis, pseudo-iteration, etc.) result pre- cisely from the aesthetic value he places on the normatively "inassimilable." But at the same time, he never fails to show how these exceptions prove the 4To a superficial observer the Stanzel-Genette relationship might, in this respect, look like one- upmanship: Genette takes Stanzel to task for working with only one opposition in his early book (Genette, 1972:187-88); Stanzel in turn points out that Genette works with only two oppositions (Stanzel, 1979:74). A closer look reveals, however, that Stanzel read Genette no more carefully than Genette had read Stanzel.</page><page sequence="5">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 161 rules of his system. Stanzel, by contrast, defines his three categories as contin- uous ranges or sliding scales that lie between contrastive poles. He therefore includes - and even welcomes - more or less anomalous narrative forms into his system, using them for all they are worth to build and populate the continuum between his categorical poles. At the same time it should be noted that his three "typical narrative situations" are "typical" precisely because they define relatively stable typological positions, and these turn out to conform quite closely to Genette's norms. As might be expected, however, Stanzel's and Genette's differing approaches to unorthodox forms of narrative lead, at certain crucial junctures of their systems, to significantly differing emphases and evaluations. 7. The result (or is it the cause?) of Stanzel's emphasis on the continuity of narrative forms is the deployment of his typology in the shape of a circle - that prototype figure of continuity and totality. After what I have said above, it hardly needs pointing out that a grand synthesis of this kind is totally alien to Genette's analytic design. This final point of difference between Theoriie and Discourse is in itself a measure of their difference, and it may be said to subsume all the preceding points. By the same token Stanzel's circular design itself may be taken as an emblem for the major strengths of his Theorie, as well as for its minor weaknesses. Even if we discount the mystic allurement of circular arrangements generally, the practical advantages of his scheme are apparent at first glance: his circular array of narrative forms can at the same time inscribe related types contiguously (as family trees cannot),5 work with multiple variables (as linear ranges cannot), and gradate oppositions (as boxed quadripolar schemas cannot). Stanzel demonstrates these advantages to anyone who joins him on his circuitous journey in the final chapter of the book (Chapter 7). I must say that I find the ride smooth most of the way. But there are a few bumpy moments, and one dangerous jolt over a roadblock. Those are the moments when one becomes aware of the major hazard inherent in the ingenious scheme: the compulsion to make the perfect shape into an end, rather than merely into a heuristic means. Before scrutinizing Stanzel's Theorie in greater detail (always with Genette's Discourse for comparative background) I must lay out his overall scheme in its bare outlines (complete with circular diagram), if only to facilitate later refer- ence and orientation. Stanzel's three cardinal oppositions (Person, Mode, Perspective) divide his circle into six sectors that I have marked clockwise with Roman numerals (see Figure 1).6 Three of these sectors represent the typical narrative situations: Authorial, as in Tom Jones (I), Figural, as in Portrait of the Artist (III), and 'Stanzel himself points out the advantages of his graphic scheme over those of Dole2el (1967) and Fuiger (1972) in this respect (76-77). "Since Stanzel's circular diagram (which fills a double page in his book) could not be reproduced in full, I have constructed my own "simplified" version, and severely pruned the ring of textual titles that surrounds it.

Unlike Stanzel's earlier book, the central chapters of Theorie (4, 5 and 6) are devoted to his three cardinal oppositions, rather than to his three narrative situations. My discussion will follow this more theoretically oriented division, but will draw as well on material presented in the large final Chapter 7 mentioned above: the guided tour of the typological circle. 1. PERSON I. I. The Opposition Third Person/First Person One may well characterize narrative theory since The Rhetoric of Fiction by reversing its most notorious statement: "Perhaps the most overworked distinc- tion is that of person" (Booth 1961:150). This distinction has, at any rate, been decidedly underworked by the French narratologists, at least until Genette rehabilitated it in the guise of his heterodiegetic and homodiegetic narrative types. But even Genette devotes only a few peremptory pages of his Voice chapter to "Persons," too little and too late for integration with his other basic categories (Rimmon, 1976:59; Bal, 1977:112-13, have especially noted the conspicuous non-correlation with Focalization). What is more, due to his Proustian paradigm, Genette - like Todorov with his Laclosian paradigm before him - spends far more time in the homodiegetic (first-person) region than in the heterodiegetic (third-person) region. Clearly only constant shuttling over the frontier can make one fully aware of the regional differences and peculiarities. Stanzel's wanderlust serves him well in this respect: his inten- sive, even-handed discussion of the long-neglected opposition of person is a welcome corrective to the person-blindness of other modern theorists. Lest non-German readers be put off by Stanzel's persistence in employing the conventional terms Ich-Erziihlung (first-person or I-narration) and Er-</page><page sequence="8">164 DORRIT COHN Erziihlung (third-person or He-narration) for this opposition, it should be pointed out at the start that this is simply a short-hand notation, and that Stanzel is no less acutely aware than Genette of its inadequacy (see esp. 71). To replace these terms - even more firmly ensconsed in German than in French and English - with unwieldy circumlocutions would not have been worth the small gain in precision. What matters is that Stanzel endows his pronominal terms with rigorous meanings, and that these meanings correspond exactly to Genette's Greek neologisms: his Ich-Erziihlung is a narrative that posits the identity of the narrator's and the characters' realms of existence (homodiegetic type), his Er-Erziihlung a narrative that posits the non-identity of these realms (heterodiegetic type). On the "ontological basis" (121) of these definitions Stanzel shapes the contrastive images of his two narrator types: the "embodied" narrator (Ich mit Leib) whose voice we hear in first-person narration (principally sectors V and VI), and the "disembodied" narrator whose voice we hear in authorial narration (principally sector I); the latter is of course also always nameless, e.g., "Fielding." As my free translation of the construct "Ich mit Leib" (lit. "I with body") may indicate, I am not overly happy with this carnal nomenclature. Most narrators of first-person novels remain disincarnated qua narrators, pace Tristram Shandy's "vile cough" or Felix Krull's "fatigue." Would not the temporal (mnemonic) thread that ties the first-person narrator to the events he recounts, and its absence for the authorial narrator, have pointed up their distinctive features more accurately? Still, it must be granted that Stanzel's picturesque imagery serves to dramatize the essential theoretical distinction: first-person narration posits a relationship of existential contiguity between discourse and story, authorial narration posits a merely mental, cognitive relationship between these two fictional spheres. Though valid as far as it goes, Stanzel's theoretical argument on this point does not go nearly as far as it might. It reaches neither the depth of Kate Hamburger's language-philosophical analysis in The Logic of Literature (Ham- burger, 1973), nor the precision of Nomi Tamir's linguistic approach in her article on "personal" narration (Tamir, 1976). Unlike Hamburger's thesis, which differs from Stanzel on substantial grounds, Tamir's - based as it is on Benveniste's analysis of "subjective" and "non-subjective" pronouns - corre- lates remarkably well with this aspect of Theorie. Another strong theoretical ground for the opposition of person is provided in a recently translated article by Michal Glowifiski, who discusses first-person narration in the context of "formal mimetics," and draws attention to the "totally different semantic design" of the two principal narrative forms (Glowiriski, 1977:103). Stanzel's thesis thus finds itself theoretically bolstered from several different directions, even if it does not provide an very solid base of its own. On the other hand Stanzel, being a preeminently "practical" theorist, pro- vides a wealth of empirical evidence, including glimpses into the working notes of writers who wavered between grammatical persons, analyses of cinematic transpositions, and experiments in pronomial "translation" (all duly un-</page><page sequence="9">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 165 successful). Even more important, the far-reaching implications of personal form on such interpretive problems as narratorial cognition, motivation, and reliability are expertly demonstrated. 1.2. Transition between Persons on the Authorial Side As should by now be clear, Stanzel leaves the frontier separating first-person from authorial narration (VI to I) wide open. Here lies not only his principal disagreement with Hamburger, but also a substantial difference with Genette. For where Stanzel views a relative difference (and thus a sliding scale between the "I" of a David Copperfield and the "I" of a "Fielding," Genette establishes an absolute barrier between "two very different situations which grammar renders identical" (1980:244). They therefore look upon texts that are unstable in this respect with a very different eye: Stanzel welcomes them into his system, Genette regards them as "infractions" on a barrier that is "in principle invari- able" (1980:245). Accordingly, Stanzel finds instances of an authorial narra- tor's "embodiment" (Verleiblichung) - as in Chapter 62 of Vanity Fair, or Chapter I of Madame Bovary - grist for his mill (257-62), while Genette calls them "infractions on an implicit law" (1980:245) - which is surely too strong a term for a fairly conventional nineteenth-century practice. When the frontier is crossed in the opposite direction, however, and a first-person narrator momen- traily takes on the privileges of a disembodied narrator (Proust relating Bergotte's dying thoughts, Zeitblom reporting conversations that took place in his absence), the infraction is more flagrant. For these cases Genette's cry of "paralepsis" (1980:251) seems more justified than the typological mileage Stanzel gets out of them; for him these anomalies simply represent "the authorialization of the first-person narrator" (265). Genette's and Stanzel's differing attitudes to the relationship between homo- and heterodiegetic narration is also evident from their treatment of the narra- tive form known (since Friedman, 1955) by the term "'I' as Witness." For Genette, who classifies it as a sub-type of homodiegetic narration and leaves it nameless, it is no more closely related to his heterodiegetic absolute than its "autodiegetic" cousin; he simply concedes that "absence is absolute, but presence has its degrees" (1980:245). Stanzel, by contrast, "uses" this "peri- pheral Ich-Erzahler" (as he calls him) to populate an otherwise sparsely settled sector (VI, where first-person narration overlaps with external perspective), and in the process builds a rich gamut of narrative positions that range from the quasi-autobiographical Tristram Shandy, via the peripheral narrator-friends of Gatsby and Leverkiihn, to the nameless "inhabitant" of the Karamazov's town (262-66). Regrettably he also places frame-narrators and fictional editors in this sector (257), a swift move that he barely justifies or illustrates, and that is therefore difficult to refute. On the face of it, I would argue that diegetic outsiders of this type have no legitimate place in Stanzel's uni-diegetic typology. All the other instances of narrative mediacy he discusses are (in Genette's terms) either intra-diegetic or extra-diegetic (at a level once-removed from the deigesis).</page><page sequence="10">166 DORRIT COHN Editors and frame-narrators, by contrast, narrate from a level twice-removed from the diegesis, before they yield the narration to extra- or intradiegetic narrators. Their indirect presentation of the diegesis therefore cannot be placed on a continuum with direct narratorial mediation of any kind. Nor are these pluri-diegetic forms needed to shape the typological continuum from peripheral first-person to authorial narration - a point to which I will return in my conclusion, when I will have further circular revisions to propose. 1.3. Transition between Persons on the Figural side If I find the transit between first-person and authorial narration fairly easy to negotiate, I find the transit between first-person and figural narration - dia- metrically across (IV to III) - far more difficult. In fact, this is where I encounter the previously mentioned roadblock. Given Stanzel's repeated insis- tence that the passage over the two-way border ("I" to "he" and "he" to "I") is "seamless," "imperceptible," and "unmarked," it is clear that I am here in my area of greatest disagreement with his typology. What is at stake, in brief, is Stanzel's thesis that "in the realm of the representation of consciousness the opposition between I- and he-reference becomes essentially unmarked (merkmallos), and thus loses the structural significance it has in the realm of the representation of the outer world" (147). This concluding sentence of an extended section entitled "Alternation between I-reference and he-reference" (134-147) at the same time also anticipates (and justifies) his later placement of interior monologue texts - like "Penelope" - in sector IV of his circle, the sector that separates figural novels like A Portrait of the Artist (III) from autobiographical novels like David Copperfield (V) (see 267-70, 284-98). The passageway between persons thus tunnels (or streams) through consciousness, as it were. Before inspecting this passageway itself we must first examine how Stanzel goes about constructing it. To demonstrate the unmarked quality of pronomial reference in texts focused on the protagonist's inner life he draws on three different types of texts (not always clearly discriminated), none of which, in my opinion, substantiates his thesis convincingly: 1) Certain modern experimental novels (by Frisch, Vonnegut, and others, 140-42, 145-46). Here "I" and "he" do indeed "alternate" freely - and by no means only when the inner life is concerned. But they do so because linguistic norms of personal reference are deliberately broken, resulting in what Genette aptly calls "a pronominal vertigo in tune with a free logic and a more complex conception of 'personality"' (1980:246). Anomalous texts of this kind - Claude Simon's La Route des Flandres is another notable example - obviously cannot serve as convincing proofs of a literary linguistic norm: their pronominal experiments, far from being "unmarked," tend to (and are in- tended to) shock readers out of their wits. 2) Autobiographical novels where the narrator intermittently refers to himself in the third person (Henry Esmond, The Tin Drum, All the King's Men, 135-140). Here we surely do not have an "essentially unmarked" alternation</page><page sequence="11">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 167 either, but a striking (and quite traditional) "figure of enunciation" - as Philippe LeJeune shows in "Autobiography in the Third-Person" (Lejeune, 1977) - and one that is by no means confined to passages focused on con- sciousness.7 The "he" of such texts, moreover, is clearly an "as if' form, and no one would be inclined to associate the narrative voice that utters it with anyone other than the autobiographical "I" of the text. 3) Novels that embed first-person segments within a third-person context (Stanzel's principal examples are from Herzog [1431, Women in Love [144], and the "Calypso" section in Ulysses [287-891). Here the change of person is both real and in conformance with the literary norm, as well as related to the representation of consciousness. But it is neither "unmarked," nor "struc- turally insignificant." Take Stanzel's crown witness, the passage from "Calypso" (from which I quote only the second half): -O, there you are, Mr. Bloom said, turning from the fire. The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writing-table. Prr. Scratch my head. Prr. Mr. Bloom watched curiously, kindly, the lithe black form. Clean to see: the gloss of the sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees. -Milk for the pussens, he said. -Mrkgnao! the cat cried. They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too. Wonder what I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me. The italics are Stanzel's, and correctly mark off the textual segments that render Bloom's interior monologue (with first-person reference) from the narrative segments (with third-person reference). In this sense Stanzel is right to say that "the reference to the bearer of consciousness alternates between I and he" (287). But what does this alternation mean, in effect? Nothing more nor less than it always means when a speaker is quoted in a third-person context: it marks a change in the instance of discourse, from the narrator to the character. Granted that Joyce's refusal to signal Bloom's silent words either semantically or graphically makes them stand out less clearly from the narrative context than his conversation with the pussens. But his interior monologues are nonetheless marked off by more than merely the change between third- and first-person reference (which, incidentally, is itself emphatically marked by the repeated appelation "Mr. Bloom"): they are also accompanied by the change of the tense system: "He bent down to her ... Wonder what I look like to her. " To say that in a text of this kind "the distinction of personal reference I/he has become unmarked, hence structurally irrelevant" (288-89) is there- fore wrong on both counts. Were the choice of pronouns structurally irrele- vant, we would be unable to separate Bloom's monologues from the narrative context (which is in fact the case at some moments in Ulysses, but precisely I am not convinced by Stanzel's demonstration of a correspondence between pronominal changes and focus on the inner life in Henry Esmond (137-39).</page><page sequence="12">168 DORRIT COHN at those moments where we get no personal reference, only verb- and person- less substitutionary perception or description'). The crux of the matter is that Stanzel disregards the quotational nature of embedded interior monologues, and thus the change of speakers (or instances of discourse) that takes place every time first- and third-person references alternate in a text of this type. This enables him to regard "Calypso" as simultaneously a third- and a first-person text, and to place it "on the border- line between the first-person and the figural narrative situations" (228), which in turn leads to the conclusion that the two pronominal halves of the typologi- cal circle "fuse seamlessly" (289). In sum, the need to close his circle at this crucial point makes Stanzel ignore the obvious: namely, that "Calypso" (not to mention his other examples of this type, Herzog and Women in Love) is manifestly a third-person (heterodiegetic) text, no matter how liberally or unobtrusively it tends to embed monologic quotations. What emerges from this examination of Stanzel's "transitional" person- alternating texts in the realization that no text can be placed on the boundary separating first- and third-person narration: for the simple reason that the grammatical difference pertaining between persons is not relative but absolute. In this respect the boundary line between personal references is different in nature from the other categorical boundary lines in the system, all of which can be regarded as abstract lines separating narrative forms that shade into each other gradually, imperceptibly: modal transition is determined by the relative prominence or effacement of the narrator, perspectival transition by the rela- tively external or internal perspective on the fictional world, transition between persons on the authorial side by the relative withdrawal of the narrator from the cosmos of the characters. The boundary between persons, by contrast, is both real and absolute: no gradation is possible between "I" and "he." One can therefore not conceive of first- and third-person pronouns being applied to the same character without at the same time attributing the voices that utter the different pronominal references to different speakers. And I can see no reason why this discontinuity of personal reference should be less marked when the focus is on a character's inner (mental) activities than when it is on his outer (physical) activities. If "stream-of-consciousness" texts like "Calypso" tend to make their readers less aware of personal reference that other types of XFor the same reason a textual type that is made up in its entirety of perceptions and descriptions, consistently cast in present tense, the so-called "camera eye" technique (Friedman, 1955:1178), can be regarded as person-indifferent. Stanzel himself discusses this type in a final section (293-98), and correctly points out that "the unmarked quality [of the opposition of person] is in this case attributable to the de-personalization of the consciousness that, as it were, carries the camera eye" (295). Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie and Beckett's Ping are two notorious examples discussed in this context. It seems to me entirely justified to locate this type on the person-border between III and IV - where Stanzel in fact places it in his diagram, accompanied by a cautionary question mark. What he does not acknowledge is that the external focus of these texts actually contradicts his thesis concerning the privileged role of consciousness as the realm where personal reference becomes indifferent. Genette discusses this type in connection with "simultaneous narrating" (1980:219). See also Cohn, 1978:206-07.</page><page sequence="13">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 169 narrative, I would suggest that the reason lies not in their narrative matter, but in their narrative manner; and this manner is a matter of mode, rather than person. I shall therefore return to this problem in a later context (see 2.2. below). There I shall also propose a way of removing the roadblock just described, or rather - to chance this image now - of bridging the gap that the personal structure of language inevitably opens between sectors III and IV on the typological circle. But first, before leaving the "Calypso" quote too far behind, I must question the legitimacy of sector IV itself, where Stanzel locates the fictional genre constituted in its entirety by the quotation of a fictional mind. 1.4. Interior Monologue Texts Autonomous interior monologues of the "Penelope" type and closely allied forms populate sector IV in its entirety.9 Stanzel states explicitly: "The interior monologue effects the transition between the first-person narrative situation [V] and the figural narrative situation [III]" (270). This transition, we are further told, is "inconspicuous" (unauffiillig). Both Stanzel's typological place- ment of this fictional form and his description of it raise a number of questions. Can this "transitional" type," first of all, really be called "inconspicuous"? When Joyce first read Dujardin's Les Lauriers sont coupes - the work gen- erally regarded as the first interior monologue novel - he is reported to have said: "In that book the reader finds himself established, from the first lines, in the thought of the principal charcter, and the uninterrupted unrolling of that thought, replacing the usual form of narrative, conveys to us what that person- age is doing and what is happening to him" (quoted by Ellmann, 1959:534, my emphasis). I would submit that a fictional form that struck Joyce as so unusual - other early readers of Les Lauriers used far stronger words - cannot be considered as an inconspicuous transition between two standard forms of narration. Such a view seems to me untenable even in the abstract context of a typology of narrative forms. As Joyce's comment indicates, the autonomous monologue breaks with narrative tradition because it is essentially a non- narrative form, i.e., one in which narrative elements are reduced to zero; and this in turn affiliates it closely with the two non-narrative genres: drama and (prose-)poetry (see Cohn, 1978:255-65). Now Stanzel, though he shows a certain awareness of the relational intrica- cies between the autonomous monologue and standard first-person narrative (284-86), decidedly underestimates crucial differentia between these two forms. " And he equally underestimates - indeed passes over in silence - the single but generically absolutely derisive differential between an autono- 9I apply the term "autonomous interior monologue" to texts constituted in their entirety by a single, uninterrupted, direct quotation of a character's mind (see Cohn, 1978:16-17). Stanzel, like most other critics, does not distinguish terminologically between this type of text and interior monologues quoted in third-person context. '~For an extensive analysis of the many-faceted relationship between the autonomous monologue and first-person narration, see Cohn, 1978:173-216.</page><page sequence="14">170 DORRIT COHN mous monologue text like "Penelope" and a text that quotes monologues within a third-person context like "Calypso." This differential - the melting away of the narrative context, with the ensuing disappearance of all third- person references to the monologic speaker - represents, in effect, the eman- cipation of the autonomous monologue from narrative mediacy itself. If we now remember that Stanzel's root concept of "narrative situation" is predi- cated on the generic characterization of "mediacy of presentation," it becomes clear why the autonomous monologue - if its radical nature is fully ac- knowledged - has no place on the circle of narrative situations."' Stanzel's inclusion of this form in his typology seems to me, once again, dictated solely by the exigencies of his circular continuum. A concluding glance at Genette's treatment of this non-narrative form shows a typical contrast. Since he is not hamstrung by the shaping of an all-encom- passing round of narrative types, he discusses the autonomous monologue in an entirely different, far more restricted context: the classification of techniques for the quotation of discourse ("Narrative of Words"), a subsection of his modal "Distance" (Genette, 1980:173-75). Here the autonomous monologue (or "immediate speech," as he calls it) figures as the limit case of the most "mimetic" mode for reporting a character's spoken or silent words: direct quotation. Genette thereby correctly points up the radical nature of this form: a mimesis without diegetic base, it "obliterat[es] the last traces of the narrating instance." But if Genette's more modest analytic goals here once again save him from the hazards of Stanzel's global journey, one feels a little disappointed nonetheless that he does not travel farther. In this respect the way he concludes this succinct section is typical of his discursive enterprise as a whole: "Here we verge on the problems of voice. For the moment let us not go further, and let us return to Proust." 2. MODE 2.1. The Opposition Narrator/Reflector Stanzel's opposition of Mode is the most traditional, and in that sense the least controversial polarity in his system. Its basic correspondence to Genette's concept of Distance is evident from the common pedigree to which both theorists refer: Plato's distinction between diegesis (pure narration, presenta- tion), and mimesis (pure imitation, representation), as well as to the Telling/ Showing and Summary/Scene pairs of Anglo-American vintage. Both also discuss the complexities and ambiguities attending the idea of imitation in a genre distinctively characterized by "mediacy of presentation," and where "immediacy of presentation" can therefore (save of course in dialogue) never be more than "pretense" or "illusion" (Genette, 1980:163-64; Stanzel, 189). 12 ''It is interesting to note that Stanzel is not willing (or at last not eager) to include the so-called "dramatic monologue" in the narrative genre (285). Given the structural proximity of the dramatic and the autonomous monologue forms (see Cohn, 1978:257-61) this hesitation should have applied ti plus forte raison to interior monologue texts. '2Stanzel's opposition of Mode also corresponds to Dolezel's linguistically based opposition of "texts with speaker" and "texts without speaker" (1967), to Anderegg's communication-theory based opposition of "I-You text" (reporting model) and "He-text" (narrating model) (1973), and to Todorov's opposition between narration and representation, originally called "Mode" (1966: 143), later renamed "Register" (1967:83).</page><page sequence="15">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 171 But if these critical topoi allow one to recognize an identical thing under different names, the names themselves are symptomatic of different attitudes toward the thing. Genette's spatial "distance" reveals his intention to keep it neutral, detached from such vocal creatures as narrators or characters: his approach in this "Mode" chapter demands that no "Voice" be heard in it as yet. As Mieke Bal has pointed out (Bal, 1977:111-12), this attempt is not wholly successful. She even concludes that it makes Distance a dispensable category within the Genettean system, subsidiary to problems of narrative time, focalization, level, and voice. Genette, in effect, disavows its significance himself when he maintains that in the light of the "millennial opposition between diegesis and mimesis" Proust's (in this respect perfectly traditional) first-person narrative would appear as nothing short of a paradox: "Extreme mediation, and at the same time utmost immediacy" (Genette, 1980: 167-69). For Stanzel, by contrast, Mode is the most essential of his three cateories, since it "lays the theoretical foundation for the two phenomena that result from the genre-specific criterium of mediacy: the thematization of narrative mediacy on one side, its effacement and resultant illusion of immediacy on the other" (189). His terminology, moreover, in difference to Genette's, is unabashedly anthropomorphic. He not only staunchly adheres to the tradition of placing a "narrator" at the diegetic pole, but additionally places a new conceptual creature, the "reflector," at the mimetic pole. This seems to me, on the whole, a salutary move, if only because it should put a stop once and for all to the sloppy habit of calling the protagonsits of figural novels (Stephen of the Portrait, Gregor Samsa, or Strether) the "narrators" of their stories. For the Jamesian term reflector, as his name indicates far more precisely that James' more popular term "center of consciousness" of even Stanzel's rather ghostly term "figural medium," is a fictional character who reflects (registers) and reflects (mediates) on the fictional events, but who (by definition) "never 'narrates"' (193). The heuristic value of personifying a function that French theorists tend to designate only in the negative - "the absence of the informer," Genette, (1980:166) - is demonstrated in the extensive discussion (206-256) Stanzel devotes to the modal continuum in its third-person sector (I-III) alone. His survey of this slippery terrain is by far the most differentiated modal topography we have - if anything almost too detailed for easy orientation. Given the relative neglect of third-person narrative forms by French narratologists this section of Stanzel's Theorie fulfills an especially important function. Stanzel micro-analyzes the see-sawing relationship between narrators and reflectors on the basis of numerous textual illustrations, mainly from Mann, Joyce, and Katherine Mansfield, and identifies a wealth of structural and stylistic techniques that induce dominance of one pole over the other. Intensive attention is given to the manner in which mode shapes (and is shaped by) narrative beginnings, textual indeterminacies, pronominalization of character- reference, and above all to the phenomenon labeled "figuralization [Persona- lisierung] of the narrator"'3: the entire plethora of devices - contagion, collo- ""Reflectorization," though even more unwieldy, would no doubt have been a more accurate</page><page sequence="16">172 DORRIT COHN quialization, deictic transposition, etc. - that can "pollute" the narrator's discourse with the reflector's characteristic manner of perceiving and verbalizing his experiences. Ultimately the narrator's figuralization culminates in the "figuralized narrator," by which Stanzel means "not the disappearance but the adaption of the narrator to the characters, above all to those that function as figural media [. . ] [He] engages in mimicry, hides from the reader, as it were, by adopting not only the character's perspective on the fictional world, but also his mode of perception, and in part even his voice and his idiom" (254-55). 2.2. Mode, FIS, and Person I have quoted Stanzel's own formulation of the "figuralized narrator" verbatim because I want to take him at this word in pointing up an inconsistency in his system that has important theoretical implications. Clearly the modus vivendi he attributes to the narrator at the modal reflector pole sounds very much like a handbook description of free indirect style (FIS) or erlebte Rede.14 One would therefore expect these two concepts to be intimately related in Stanzel's system. And he in fact affirms something of the sort at one point: "The figural narrative situation can be considered as an erlebte Rede stretched over an entire text" (254). Yet elsewhere in Theorie des Erzahlens an entirely different conception of this stylistic form holds sway: FIS as a device - or set of devices - midway between the authorial and the figural narrative situations (see Figure 1). I paraphrase the crucial (but not readily translatable) sentence that pinpoints this location: "In erlebte Rede the two opposed tendencies of narrative meet up with each other: the one where mediacy is overtly achieved through a narrator, and the one where mediacy is covertly achieved by a reflector" (246). Note that FIS has now been moved away from the reflector pole of the modal con- tinuum, and relocated on modally neutral ground (in segment II). This is the more surprising since Stanzel was one of the first theorists to integrate erlebte Rede into modem narrative typology, and to identify it squarely with his figural narrative situation (see esp. Stanzel, 1955:151-52; 1959:4-8). His reversion to the more traditional "dual voice" or "dual perspective" conception of FIS (recently also revived by Roy Pascal, 1977) seems to me wholly out of keeping with the theoretical base of his narrator-reflector polarity, where the (seemingly) narrator-less reflector pole corresponds so closely to the (seemingly) narrator- less linguistic structure of FIS. term for this process. I translate "Personalisierung" and "figuralization" in analogy to the transla- tion of "personales Medium" (Stanzel, 1955) as "figural medium" (Stanzel, 1971). In German the phrase "personalisierter Erzahler" creates a special problem, however: it is far too close for comfort to the phrase "pers6nlicher Erzahler (its exact antithesis: the narrator with an emphatic personality of his own), with which it will inevitably be confused. '4In the remarks that follow I take the terms erlebte Rede and "free indirect style" in their broadest meanings - as Stanzel does himself - without limiting them to the specific meaning I attribute to the term "narrated monologue" as a technique for rendering consciousness (Cohn, 1978:99-138). I assume familiarity with the basic nature of FIS, and refrain from entering the controversy that has surrounded it. For a judicious assessment of different positions taken on the subject since 1957, see McHale, 1978.</page><page sequence="17">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 173 I would suggest that this unwonted banishment of FIS from the reflector pole (III) into modally neutral teritory (II) is intimately related to the problem previously discussed of the dangerous typological passage from third- to first- person narrative forms (from III to IV and V). To put it crudely: it seems as though FIS, a style that adheres severely to third-person reference, had to be pushed back from III to II in order to pave the way for safe transit over the person-boundary from III to IV, i.e., into the sector of the autonomous interior monologue. Indeed, the most suitable stepping stone for approaching this boundary on the third-person side is clearly a narrative form in which personal references alternate, rather than one in which they consistently show in third-person form: whence the emphasis given to texts in which interior monologues are unobtrusively quoted within a third-person context, in the manner of Herzog, Women in Love, and above all the early chapters of Ulysses ("Calypso"). As I have tried to show earlier (see 1.3. above), however, this typological "strategem" is not successful. Person-alternating stream-of-con- sciousness texts, far from hiding or even bridging the interruptus that the pronominal structure of language effects at the person-boundary of the circle, remain firmly grounded on the third-person side of the boundary. A possibility that Stanzel apparently did not consider is that the gap between third- and first-person forms might be bridged with person-indifferent, rather than person-alternating textual types. I mean third-person texts that can be "rewritten" in the first person without "any alteration in the discourse other than the change of grammatical pronouns themselves" (Barthes, 1966:20). Texts of this kind exist, and they are by no means confined to stream-of- consciousness novels. They have been described by Genette as narratives that attain "perfect transitivity" (1966:159), and by Tamir as discourses with "degree zero of narrator" (1976:421). " In Stanzel's terms: a narrative dominated by "the figuralized narrator" at the reflector pole, i.e., the seemingly "narrator- less" narrative that creates the "illusion of immediacy." This is of course precisely the textual type that ideally accomodates FIS, and may even "be considered as an erlebte Rede stretched over an entire text" (254). To demonstrate the person-translatability of third-person texts of this kind, I quote a passage I have used in a similar context before (Cohn, 1978:170-71), and that has the advantage of actually stemming from a work originally com- posed in the first person, Kafka's The Castle: At that moment Barnabus stopped. Where were they? Was this the end of the road? Would Barnabus leave K.? He wouldn't succeed. K clutched Barnabus' arm so firmly that he almost hurt himself. Or had the incredible happened, and they were already in the Castle or at its gates? . . ."Where are we?" asked K. in a low voice, more of himself than of Barnabus. At that moment Barnabus stopped. Where were we? Was this the end of the road? 'SCuller (1975:199-200) points out Barthes' confusion in relating "translatable" texts of this type to Benveniste's discours, rather than to his (narrator-less) histoire.</page><page sequence="18">174 DORRIT COHN Would Barnabus leave me? He wouldn't succeed. I clutched Barnabus' arm so firmly that I almost hurt myself. Or had the incredible happened, and we were already in the Castle or at its gates? . . . "Where are we?" I asked in a low voice, more of my self than of Barnabus. Although the third-person version includes sentences in FIS (my emphasis) that render K.'s thoughts, it also includes sentences that report outer events, including K.'s gestures and spoken words. The result of the translation is a fairly standard autodiegetic text (cast in the past tense, and by that token alone quite unlike an autonomous interior monologue). The FIS sentences readily translate into a corresponding first-person style. 6 The narrators in both ver- sions remain effaced, "transparent," the attention is rivetted on the protagonist (K. in the first version, the experiencing "I" in the second) and only through him on the surrounding world. This transposition of person demonstrates the exact parity of the reflector mode on both sides of the person-boundary, a symmetry that has been ob- scured on Stanzel's circle by wedging the autonomous monologue (sector IV) between the first-person narrative situation (III) and the reflector pole (IV), but a symmetry that he nonetheless himself emphasizes in his discussion of first- person forms (267-78). In his Mode chapter, moreover, he clearly identifies the type of first-person narration that emphasizes the past, experiencing self with the reflector pole of his modal opposition (194, 198). If we remove the autonomous monologue from Stanzel's circle (a move I advocate for other reasons in 1.4. above), the reflector pole of first-person narration becomes contiguous with the reflector pole of third-person narration, as do texts that deemphasize the narrator on both sides of the person boundary. The two incarnations of the Castle passage would then come to stand neatly on either side of the boundary - waiting, as it were, to be translated into each other. This is the bridge I promised earlier. Admittedly, it is a bridge that marks, rather than effaces, the unalterable interruptus on the person boundary of the typological circle. In conclusion to this discussion of Stanzel's modal opposition I propose the following modal revision of Stanzel's thesis concerning the opposition of person (see 1.3., second paragraph): "At the reflector pole (narrator= degree zero) the opposition between I- and he-reference becomes essentially unmarked, and thus loses the structural significance it has at the narrator pole; and this is true regardless of whether the focus is on the inner or the outer world." 3. PERSPECTIVE 3.1. The Opposition External/Internal The correlation of Stanzel's perspectival opposition (external vs. internal) with Genette's types of focalization is somewhat more complicated than for the '6For a discussion of this first-person variant of FIS, see Cohn, 1978:166-69. Stanzel takes full account of this form of erlebte Rede in his discussion of first-person narration (278-80), but without clearly relating it to his reflector pole.</page><page sequence="19">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 175 personal and modal oppositions. For Genette, following Pouillon and Todorov, makes a triadic rather than a diadic distinction: zero or non-focalization (narra- tor &gt; character), internal focalization (narrator= character) and external focali- zation (narrator &lt; character). As Bal (1977:113, 119) has shown, however, his zero or non-focalization (by an "omniscient" narrator who knows his characters' minds) differs from his external focalization (by a narrator ostensibly ignorant of his characters' minds) only in respect to its object, not its subject. Since Stanzel's binary opposition external/internal is, as we shall see, not dependent on the narrator's ability to penetrate his characters' minds, we can establish the correspondence previously indicated in Chart I: internal perspective= internal focalization; external perspective= zero focalization plus external focalization. Genette's discussion of Focalization is, on the whole far more intensive and differentiated than his discussion of Distance. It touches on many of the points Stanzel examines in terms of his modal continuum, which already begins to indicate the overlap and interconnection between these two categories (whether they are labeled Distance and Focalization, as in Discourse, or Mode and Perspective, as in Theorie). But strangely Genette never makes explicit the correspondence between his principal types of Focalization (zero and internal) and the opposite poles of his Distance (diegesis and mimesis). His focal opposition is also comparable to Stanzel's modal opposition in another respect: even though he defines stable codes and discusses their "alterations" through paralipses and paralepses (1980:194-98), he tends to take his zero and internal focalizations as ideal types that don't exist "in the strict sense" (1980:192) in actual texts, but rather define a "polymodal" continuum, both within single texts and between different texts. On the whole Genette's Focalization can be said to be more broadly con- ceived than Stanzel's Perspective, which is limited to two quite specific and widely divergent aspects of narrative that are rarely treated in tandem by theorists or interpreters of fiction: presentation of space (the visible outer world) and presentation of consciousness (the invisible inner world). It is in part because it pairs such strange bedfellows - and disregards other candidates for perspectival treatment (e.g., the protagonist's appearance and behavior, the presentation of secondary characters) - that this category turns out to be somewhat less valid and unified than the categories of Mode and Person. 3.2. Spatial Perspectives Applied to spatial presentation alone, the binary opposition between external and internal perspective is fully valid, both on theoretical and on empirical grounds. Stanzel's discussion of this neglected topic enhances not only one's sensitivity to perspectival variations in spatial descriptions, but also one's awareness of the practical difficulties involved in drawing a clear demarcation between the two ideal types. I question in passing, however, whether the introduction of a separate diachronic polarity (labeled a-perspectivism/per- spectivism, 161-62) is really warranted, since it turns out to reduplicate pretty much the synchronic external/internal polarity.</page><page sequence="20">176 DORRIT COHN But in reading this extensive section (152-168), a more fundamental question arises: is the categorical separation of Perspective from Mode really justified? Stanzel himself concedes at one point that "there is evidently a close corre- spondence between internal perspective and the mode of representation domi- nated by the narrator on the other hand" (189; see also 149). In third-person fiction this correspondence is very nearly self-evident, since it is built into the modal terminology itself: what is the reflector if not the source of perspective, the medium that "reflects" - or in Genette's term "focalizes" - the fictional reality? In this respect, then, sector II on the circle, where the reflector overlaps with external perspective, turns out to be dispensable, if not downright contradictory. The situation is somewhat less clear for first-person fiction, where internal perspective overlaps with the modal dominance of the narrator in sector V. We must note, however, that Stanzel's prose (unlike his circle) divides the first-person narrative situation into two basic types: the narrator- dominated type, with emphasis on the narrating self, and the reflector-domi- nated type, with emphasis on the experiencing self (270-72). Now it would seem to me that in the first type, when the "past space" surrounding the experiencing self is present from the retrospective vantage point of the narrating self, the perspective is essentially external, not internal; only in the second type, when space is seen from the vantage point of the experiencing self (who does not yet know what he will find around the corner he is about to turn) can the term "internal perspective" have a distinctive meaning (see Genette in reference to Proust on this point, 1980:194). From which it follows that external perspective and the narratorial mode, internal perspective and the reflectorial mode correspond to each other in first-person no less than in third-person narration. 3.3. Psychological View But if perspective on the outer world does not justify the categorical partition from Mode, perspective on the inner world turns out to justify it even less. Stanzel's perspectival approach to the presentation of consciousness is, as we shall see presently, even terminologically so complex and confusing that it tends to invalidate itself. Stanzel begins by drawing a distinction between "perspective" and "view" (Sicht) (149). Whereas "perspective" applies to space (the visible outer world), "view" applies to psyche (the invisible inner world). Perspectives range from external to internal, views from "outside" to "inside." (I leave aside for the moment the question of what is meant by an "outside view of the inner world"). Now Stanzel maintains that external perspective on the outer world and outside view of the inner world always go hand in hand, as do internal perspective and inside view. The distinction between "perspective" and "view" thus turns out to be purely lexical: the kind of view a narrative presents on a character's psyche is merely a "second criterion," a "ter- minological variant" for deciding or describing the kind of perspective it presents on the fictional world as a whole (149).</page><page sequence="21">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 177 This manner of hitching, even subordinating, psychic "view" to spatial "perspective"'7 - also suggested by the fact that Stanzel entitles the chapter dealing with both these topics by the spatial term "perspective" - seems to me misleading on several grounds. For one thing, it puts the cart before the horse: for it is surely, if anything, an author's decision to give us an "inside view" of a figural mind that will determine his presentation of the surrounding world from an internal (figural) perspective, and not the other way around. But even more important is the fact that perspectives on fictional space and on fictional minds don't always coincide - as Uspensky shows in the section of his Poetics of Composition entitled "The Nonconcurrence of the Spatial and Temporal Points of View with the Psychological Point of View" (Uspensky, 1973:105-107). ' How varied and constantly changing the combinations and permutations be- tween external/internal perspectives and outside/inside views can be within a single textual passage has also been recently demonstrated by Mieke Bal (1977); and I would suggest (though I cannot demonstrate this here is detail) that her critique of Genette's oversimplified analysis of focalizations also applies to Stanzel's treatment of the relationship between perspectives and views. At this point we must examine Stanzel's curious concepts of "inside view" and "outside view" themselves. These concepts depart from (and will therefore inevitably be confused with) the standard terminology in the field: "Outside view" here does not signify the narrator's unwillingness or inability to tell us what goes on in a character's mind (Pouillon's "vision de dehors," Genette's "external focalization," Uspensky's "external psychological point of view"); nor does "inside view" correspond to the meaning normally given to this term (e.g., by Booth, 1961, or Cohn, 1978), i.e., any manner of narratorial access to a fictional mind. Rather, Stanzel's terms denote different ways of presenting the inner world: outside views through telling, inside views through showing, i.e., creating the illusion that the inner world of a reflector figure is presented "immediately" (169). (Note in passing that Stanzel reverts to a purely modal vocabulary to define these terms!) It now becomes clear why Stanzel's text is dotted with the paradoxical phrase "outside view of the inner world," and its redundant counterpart "inside view of the inner world." The phrase "outside of the inner world" points to a deeper problem inherent in Stanzel's perspectival approach to the presentation of consciousness. It surfaces in the following passage: "If in a narrative external perspective pre- "At one point Stanzel goes so far as to maintain that "internal perspective is a prerequisite IVoraussetzung] for the presentation of the inner world from an inside view" (169). "XAdmittedly, Uspensky's examples of texts combining an internal spatial with an external psychological point of view will not serve to refute Stanzel's thesis, since - as I explain below - Uspensky's "external psychological point of view" does not signify the same as Stanzel's "outside view." But even if "outside view" is taken in Stanzel's sense of the term, one can readily find examples that prove him mistaken on this point: in Death in Venice (and Mann generally) the perspective on space is consistently internal, the view of the protagonist's psyche largely "outside"; conversely Madame Bovary (and Flaubert generally) tends to conjoin external perspective on space with "inside view" of the psyche.</page><page sequence="22">178 DORRIT COHN dominates (authorial narrator) then the inner world, say in the form of a thought-report [Gedankenbericht] [. ..] For the omniscient narrator and his external perspective there is actually no such thing as an inner world qua inner world, for him everything is available, as it were, qua outer world [ihm ist gewissermassen alles als Aussenwelt verfiigbar]" (73-74). Is Stanzel not for- getting here that fiction in the third person is precisely predicated on the potential clairvoyance of the narrator into his characters' minds? and that this vision is in no sense dependent on a "projection of innerwordly happenings onto the outer world"? In this respect even the most distanced authorial analysis differs by its very nature from, say, the notes a psychoanalyst records on the basis of the symptoms he has observed in his patient. The passage just quoted also displays another weakness of Stanzel's perspec- tival approach to the narrative presentation of inner life: the tendency to associate his two types of "view" with different techniques for presenting consciousness - outside view with thought report, inside view with mono- logue. ' If we remember how rapidly these techniques alternate on a typical page of narrative prose without affecting the overall "view' we receive of, say, the minds of Madame Bovary or Mrs. Ramsey, it becomes clear that the inside/outside dichotomy becomes impractical, if not entirely meaningless, when tied to these devices. As I have demonstrated in detail elsewhere (Cohn, 1978), all three principal techniques (thought-report - or, as I prefer to call it, psycho-narration - narrated monologue and quoted monologue) can mix and match freely in the authorial as well as in the figural narrative situation, and their predominance or modification in different texts can be readily accounted for in terms of Stanzel's modal scale between dissonant (narrator-dominated) and consonant (reflector-dominated) narration. In sum, I find that Stanzel's Perspective, conceived as a separate category, creates more problems than it solves.2 " Granted that the presentation of space and the presentation of consciousness are both essential dimensions of narra- tive discourse which must be integrated into a typology of fictional forms - an integration that Theorie achieves more fully than other works of this scope. But it turns out that the divergence between these two dimensions is too great for paired and parallel perspectival treatment. And it also becomes plain that their dependence on the narrator/reflector opposition is too intimate for severance from the modal axis. For which reason Genette's decision to treat "Distance" and "Focalization" - "the two chief modalities of that regulation of narrative 'gIn this connection the location of FIS in sector II becomes especially confusing, since Stanzel thereby assigns the technique for rendering consciousness that is cast in FIS - the narrated monologue - to the domain of extenal perspective, and thus to the narrator who gives us an "outside" view of the invisible inner world. It hardly needs pointing out that there is something awry with this assignation. 'To my knowledge Todorov is the only other theorist who has defined a categorical distinction of this type on the grounds that the modal emphasis on the narrator does not always coincide with external perspective, nor the modal emphasis on the character with internal perspective (Todorov, 1967:85-86). I find his swift argument (based on the closing structure of Les Liaisons dangereuses) unconvincing.</page><page sequence="23">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 179 information that is mood" (1980:162) - under a joint heading seems to me fully justified. But this formal arrangement does not in itself amount to a unified approach to this syncretic complex: diegesis/mimesis and the different types of focalization, in fact, receive separate (and unequal) treatment in Discourse. Stanzel's totalizing intent, on the other hand, induces him to correlate in practice what he separates in theory: thus, paradoxically, his separate chapters on Mode and Perspective, taken together, provide a more unified approach to the "regulation of narrative information" than Genette's coupled analyses. CONCLUDING COMMENTS To conclude my tour of Theorie des Erziihlens, I would like to cast my main strictures in terms of a series of friendly amendments, made expressly from within Stanzel's system, and in accordance with its fundamental premises. These amendments are summarized in Figure 2, and detailed below. Figure 2 Narrator (External Perspective) Dissonant Authorial First-Person Third-Person First Third Person Mode boundary Person Consonant Figural First-Person Third-Person Reflector (Internal Perspective) 1. Subsumption of Perspective under Mode. If, as I have tried to show above (3.2. and 3.3.), perspective is not viable as a category separated from Mode, the modal axis (the opposition narrator/reflector) can be made to coincide with the perspectival axis (the opposition external/internal). This coincidence now enables one to place the combined modal-perspectival axis at right angles to the person axis (the opposition first person/third person). Though the four resultant quadrants do not correspond exactly to Stanzel's</page><page sequence="24">180 DORRIT COHN six sectors, they now divide the circle in a manner that answers all my addi- tional objections to the ruling schema of Theorie. 2. Absorption of transition sector II. The sector wedged between the authori- al and the figural narrative situations (I and III) on the typological circle is the neutral terrain to which Stanzel banishes FIS from what appears to me its rightful place at the reflector pole (see 2.2. above). Once FIS is returned to its true matrix (the figure narrative situation) sector II loses it typological signifi- cance, and becomes dispensable. The only other distinctive narrative form Stanzel locates within it - the modally neutral dialogued scene with minimal narratorial comment (as in "The Killers") - can now easily take its place on the open boundary between the two principal third-person narrative forms. 3. Closed border between Persons at the reflector pole. The small hiatus at the nadir of the redesigned circle reflects my difference with Stanzel concerning the typlological meaning of person-alternating texts like "Calypso" (discussed at length in 1.3.), as well as my insistence that the person boundary at the reflector pole, though it can be approached by seemingly narrator-less texts from either side, cannot be crossed without the aid of grammatical transposi- tion (as explained in 2.2.). 4. Removal of autonomous monologue (sector IV). I explain my objection to the inclusion of an essentially non-narrative form of fiction in a typology of narrative mediacy in 1.4. above. 5. Modal division of first-peson narrative forms. This division (and expan- sion to twice its original size) of the sector where Stanzel locates the first- person narrative situation (sector V) seems to me important for two related reasons: 1) It emphasizes the essential distinction between first-person texts focalized through the narrating self (and in this sense told from an external perspective, see 3.2.), and those focalized through the experiencing self. These two types bear no name in Theorie, though Stanzel distinguishes them clearly in his discussion of first-person forms (270-72). I have identified them on Figure 2 as "dissonant" and "consonant" types of first-person narration (terms previously used in Cohn, 1978:145-61). 2) This division graphically represents the symmetry (described in 2.2.) between the modal-perspectival continua in the first- and third-person halves of the typological circle. 6. Absorption of transition sector VI. My reasons for dispensing with this sector are somewhat less substantial than in the cases of sectors II and IV. Yet, after excluding narrative and editorial frames from Stanzel's typology (for reasons explained in 1.2.), only peripheral first-person narratives remain to populate the transition zone from dissonant first-person to authorial narration. And although this is a rich and important type, it hardly warrants extensive separate space on the circle. (Stanzel himself actually locates all its most important representatives near the boundary between sectors V and VI.) What is more, since in my revised schema external perspective coincides with the dissonant half of first-person narration, the peripheral type can now be accommodated quite readily within this quadrant, in the region where its arc approaches the person-boundary and the narrator-zenith of the circle, even as the narration situation modulates to the authorial type.</page><page sequence="25">THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF NARRATIVE 181 Readers familiar with Stanzel's earlier work will recognize that the amended model sketched above shows a marked resemblance to his original (1955) model. This resemblance is not entirely coincidental. My partial reversion to the classic simplicity of the earlier model is prompted in part by a sense that Theorie occasionally carries its typological finesse (and gdomdtrie!) one or two steps too far - and perhaps to a point of diminishing returns. But my amenda- tion is actually a kind of compromise between the old and the new. For it is able to incorporate very nearly all the refinements and clarifications introduced by the categorical (personal, modal, perspectival) explicitness of Theorie, while at the same time leaving its deployment of narrative forms very nearly intact (trimming it only slightly by the removal of non-diegetic and pluri-diegetic types). Other readers will no doubt propose different adjustments to square Stanzel's circle with their own experience of the fictional genre. But even as they do so, they will have to acknowledge Stanzel's encirclement as a uniquely compelling schema for unifying the variety of narrative discourse. REFERENCES ANEREGG, JOHANNES, 1973.
