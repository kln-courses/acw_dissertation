They • W give the perspective of, or, so to speak, situate an awareness through externality which need to be grasped com prehensively by intuition. Language, thus, is not only a descrip tion of reality but an enactment. la. Externality defines itself in terms of the divergent ends of uti lity, function and significance. It derives its distinction from the diffe rence between the numinous and the banal—and the cardinal distinctions in language previously described as the sacred and the profane. 2. No knowledge is arrived at analytically. On the other hand, it is always a pure presence, a pure upsurge before the cognizing subject. All knowledge, therefore, is intuitive in origin and histori cally given. 2a. Analysis serves only to elucidate. It does not discover anything. Analysis may define the divergent ends of utility, function and signi ficance, and thereby clean up the tangled mass of epistemológica! as well as ontological confusion of priorities. It can further enhance 113</page><page sequence="2">INDIAN LITERATURE understanding by bringing to light hidden premises, subjective value judgements and ethical, moral choices which constitute the basic substratum of any utterance. But analysis is not the faculty which knows. It is rather a synthetic intuitive awareness which grasps knowledge. 3. A structural-historical epistemology, may, therefore, place these pure intuitions in terms of their social utility, function and significance in a dynamic historical medium. 4. Such a historical conception of epistemology would thereby conceive its genesis and final achievement as constituted within history. A catalogue of pure intuitions, as for example, René Wellek's A History of Modern Criticism would not serve our pur pose, though. The conception of history as a mere temporal succession or spatial juxtaposition is erroneous and futile. The dynamism of history consists in its intentional character and requires a philosophical understanding of its project character, without which the correspondence of knowledge and reality, however tenuous and discontinuous, cannot be envisaged in all its dynamic particularity and evolving generality. Understanding history also involves a recognition of the specific carriers of history, that is, the human masses who are the substances of historical realizations of human potentials. 5. Knowing is a distinct and separate form of activity with crea tion of meaning as its sole purpose. It cannot be said to be a purely mental phenomenon even though interior monologue seems to be its most distinctive mode of operation. As a global tendency to self-awareness, it is implicit in many overtly practical activities, too. 5a. Meaning does not inhere either in the knowing subject or in the surrounding not-self. The making of the not-self into an object is itself a meaningful relationship which could not have taken place at all if the meaning-endowing activity were not the primary activity of the 114</page><page sequence="3">SILENCE AND COMMUNICATION subject. It is this original impulse through which meanings come into being. Knowing or creation of meaning entails some ontological obligations as meaning indicates a participation of the not-self in the self and the self in the not-self. Epistemology, as such, discusses the possibility of a relationship and ontology investigates the objective validity of such relationship. The divorce of epistemology and ontology is injurious to both and detrimental to the enquiry into the objective status of the relationship thus enjoined. 6. Analysis constitutes the entire field of human perception as banal while intuition conceives the locus of human cognition as inherently numinous. 6a. The distinction becomes clear when we take note of the fact that the notion of godhead, when analysed, suggests little or only a specific attribute but as a numinous concept it has a nimbus of emotional life attached to it. The more one analyses it the less it suggests. Analysis is thus seen inimical to the understanding of the numinosity of intui tive concept. 7. All concepts are intuitive in origin. Only their later semantic ramifications, syntactic organizations and linguistic utility in a field of non-linguistic cultural-behavioural complex of associa tions is amenable to analytic investigations. In tidying up its meaning, analysis dispenses with the meaning altogether, and leaves only its bare, skeletal externality in its place. 7a. Because of this intuitive origin and numinosity, all primal concepts are multifaceted; they include their opposites into their meanings. This also accounts for the original binary character of all concepts, and points at their hidden dialectical dynamism. 8. Analysis seeks to retrace the steps by which the original mythopoeic awareness concretized in the intuition has acquired the later accretions of meaning in terms of utility, function and significance. By clearing up the age-old accretions, analysis drives us to the point wherefrom we may take the leap into the nameless that which the words ultimately refer to. 115</page><page sequence="4">INDIAN LITERATURE 9. Had it not been for the native mischievousness of human nature, it were best to communicate only in silence. Since it is the complete mutuality of silence that ultimately communicates whatever that is communicable, it is only through sheer irres ponsibility that one commits oneself to speech or writing. Nothing beyond a willingness to understand is elicited by speech or writing, and the ultimate communication of speech or writing is always that they are, in the final analysis, derivative of and mediated by the original and final commitment to silence. Speech or writing, in spite of their ultimate nugatory influ ence, conduce, however, to a general willingness to suspend words finally and communicate the original sense of urgency conceived in silence and likewise taking shape in silence. 10. The intuition, or self-absorbed self-vision, which gives meaning to words, may subsequently withdraw itself from this union of matter and form whereby created meaning acquires the poise of objective knowledge. In the absence of this original participation, words shrivel up into mere inert externality with out their self-consuming effulgence. The original silence which takes shape into words as the genius of a nation chooses or an age pleases, communicates its meaning in silence, too. 10a. Analysis follows in the wake of alienation of meaning. It appeals to be a kind of semantic necrophilia. Through analysis of the corpse of the original living intuition, an attempt is made to catch its vital, life-force. This is an unreachable goal; analysis can never reach the core of the original intuition. What it can do, however, is to compare and contrast various experiences and thereby expand the horizon of the common body of shared experiences. This is the trend of modern philosophical writings. 11. Finally, to sum up, a few words on the limited aspect of the externality of words: Utility, function and significance ultimately yield place to self-vision or self-representation as the final goal of all commu nication. 116</page><page sequence="5">SILENCE AND COMMUNICATION These three are aspects of the self-representation itself in the dynamic historic mode of truth consciousness. Analytical investigations of these three aspects only prepare us for the inner plunge into the secret abyss of meaning beyond externality. 12. Total silence is inconceivable, except in death, which is more a cessation of the intention to communicate than of com munication itself. It is the final capitulation to the incommuni cable. Our everyday commerce with communication embraces, however, innumerable little pools of silence in the behavioural complex which are graded levels of consciousness. Silence in the sense of a suspension of words can speak volumes as when one gets angry and refuses to speak, or one is stunned by a sudden event and is unable to put one's thoughts into words. Silent, or subliminal communication, means on the one hand a sober acceptance of the limitation of the communicative capa city of language, and on the other, an allowance for the shaping of the will in silent communication with the self. 13. In the field of philosophy or religion one notes that silence is the last word on many crucial and thorny topics. Zen Buddhism has already made an esoteric cult of the knowledge which lies incommunicable and is witnessed in a sudden plunge into silence. In advanced physics and linguistic philosophy as well, modern enquiry meets with a profound non-human silence which treats human garrulousness with utter contempt. The consequent anxiety can only be mitigated by a Keatsian negative capability or Yogic sobriety. Whether one wants to mitigate it or face it properly as Existentialists propose is, however, a different matter. 14. The project of man on earth is an anthropomorphic project. 117</page><page sequence="6">INDIAN LITERATURE This anthropomorphization of nature, non-human in its ulti mate reality and dumb self-forgetfulness, bestows on man the binding duty of having to seize and reclaim from the surround ing ocean of irrationality fresh grounds for a rational ordering and organization of its existence. Anthropomorphization provides the secret substance of unity, and is ultimately the subjective emanation of the species nature of man. But inasmuch as man himself is a product of nature, and mind, though a negation of matter, is itself only a product of matter, there is scope for the faith that man himself is the secret truth of nature, of nature coming to be conscious of herself through man. The subjective emanation of the truth of man may thus appear as the objective apprehension and estab lishment of the truth of nature. 14a. Merleau-Ponty says that objectivity is not totality or absolutely opposed to subjectivity but is, on the contrary, itself a nexus of a number of subjectivities. This also points towards humanization of nature as the growing and progressive reality of man's relation to nature. The struggle with nature is thus seen to be lodged in a totality with nature as the sole positive principle. 15. Language is the realm of rationality—the little tongue of land amidst the surrounding abyss of dark irrationality. Silence is not irrationality itself, but a luminous shadow of the beyond falling on and demarcating the limits of human rationality. 15a. Rationality does not in the end explain, but seeks to hold to gether in a comprehensive grasp of totality the contraries in which human existence is shaped. Language and rationality prepare the ground for the original urgency to conceive in silence. They elucidate the paradox of reason which ever reverts us to the primal awareness of ourselves as a project. Rationality derides faith, but is itself supported on faith. Digging away at its own basis, it ever perishes on its own nihilism. 16. The ultimate destiny as well as the original impulse of man is a choice of being. Language and rationality can both at their farthest possibility 118</page><page sequence="7">SILENCE AND COMMUNICATION realise the necessity to effect this choice of being. They cannot, however, choose for us, or even explain one choice as superior to another, since this choice involves an activity of a larger, deeper and more integral selfhood than is amenable to rational investigation. It involves a subliminal choice of being. 17. Love aligns us to garrulousness as hatred aligns us to silence. But in the deepest moments of shared love, love also attains to a shared mutuality of silent communication which is just the opposite of silence envisaged by hatred, which again is little more than a refusal to speak. Both love and hatred are pre-logical choice of beings which as such lie beyond the realm of rational explication. But given the original irrationality of the choice of being or a certain rela tionship enjoined by being with itself, all else follows rationally. Language can do little else than confront us with this inevitabi lity and necessity of a choice of being to be effected in silence. 18. While talking or writing, one, as it were, yields oneself to language completely. Words, profligate of meaning and redounding on authority, shape themselves according to a logic intrinsically theirs. One feels to be in the grip of an alien power, given such external limitations as the limits of one's vocabulary, feeling and thought-content. It is as complete a choice of being as love and hatred, only different in that it ceases to use words as means and instead employs them as things themselves. The hidden premises of all linguistic exercises, all of which when tested against this intuitive experience prove to be false, are as follows: (i) Thoughts are mere shuffling of words. (ii) All thoughts are communicable in language. (iii) Words are mine, just as thoughts are mine. (iv) Concepts, images and words do not just stand for things, they are the things themselves. As a corollary to the fourth belief comes the paradoxical aware 119</page><page sequence="8">INDIAN LITERATURE ness that language erects a film or screen of separative vision between perception and reality. Language hides rather than reveals reality. 19. Words should be construed or used in the true spirit of Augustinian Platonic dialectic whereby they are conceived as reaching out for, rather than naturally attaining, reality as im mediately as the reverse side of their own beings. However, they ought to be measured out in a hierarchical order such that they lead us step by step up the stairs of a precipice till we take the plunge into reality borne on the concurrent inner compulsion welling up within us. The purport of every linguistic exercise should be a circuit ous mode of self-effacement so that the original silence is recap tured at a higher level of communication. The silence thus ap proached may then become a silence mediated by rational explication, or a higher silence. At a maturer point beyond, language may even persuade the reader to transform his original intention to listen outward to an intention to listen inward, the latter being the first step to wards creative formulation of one's own philosophy. 20. The beyond of language is not, as is commonly surmised, an extra-mundane or supra-physical beyond. Religious exegesis and mystical experiences raise this spurious wall of difference whereby words such as 'silence' and 'beyond' are so packed with overt other-worldly connotations that they are difficult of usage in the normal sense. The beyond of language is the realm of praxis. Without an instance of silence in the transformation of original, omnipre sent nebulous reality into an instrumental complex, no praxis is conceivable. To begin with reality is thus omnipresent, all-encompassing, that is, including the self and the world in one grasp of a nebulous totality. The original intentionality is thus lodged in a silence before its birth. Hence, the later divagation in the 120</page><page sequence="9">SILENCE AND COMMUNICATION total being by which the world as the instrumental complex and the self as the opposed particular come into being. Silence is likewise precipitated in the transformation of the contemplative poise of the self to the active poise. The purport of this paper is to show that communication is not, as is commonly held, totally opposed to silence. Rather, the being of communication is shot through and through with silences, besides being chasmed out of silence in the beginning and the end. Communication, alternatively as self-expression, may find itself imprisoned in its original privacy and thus may appear gagged and quite the opposite of communication properly so understood. These polarities of language offer rather the opposed priorities of a choice of being between which communication proper oscillates perpetually. In the process, we experience certain paradoxes, such as, firstly the tautological awareness that only that which is com municable is communicated in language or, secondly, that langu age, though an instance of human will, is still alien to us, and makes and unmakes according to its own pleasure without any reference to the outside, non-linguistic world. 20 a. Alienation of meaning, more than anything else, demarcates one society or nation from another society or nation, and also one age from another age. This again is what lends credence to the substan tial aspect of the spirit of an age or a nation. It is typified by a general consensus in a certain usage, in the common belief in a number of generative concepts and is finally attested to by the breaking up of a continuum of experience in the dissolution of the numinosity of these forms. This leads in turn to a development of analytic, speculative exegesis upon those concepts in the absence of the original, native intuitive experience. 21. Belief is not communicable, but certitude is. Certitude is always analytical in character. The point to note, however, is that analysis can never go beyond intuition completely. Certi tude is the reduction of a complex representation into a number of simpler beliefs. Belief is conception in silence, a choice of 121</page><page sequence="10">INDIAN LITERATURE being effected in silence. It is the original urgency of human communication and the invisible medium of communication. 22. If the main aim of language is description of reality and, as Wittgenstein says, the world is all that is the case, then language is primarily representative in character. This, however, disre gards the creative function of language. What is the relation of the creative aspect of language to its representative nature? Witgenstein says that language cannot represent the pictorial forms by which the world is represented to it. This amounts to an admission of defeat in the total representation of the world be cause the world thus conceived excludes the pictorial forms by which the world is represented. This, in turn, leads to the absurd suggestion that in order to describe the world we need some other-worldly postulates. The way out of this quandary lies in the proper appreciation of the creative function of language. In articulating the world, language is engaged in qualitatively changing the world itself. Through language we can never arrive at the dumb reality pre existent to language but rather gain at the idea of the articulate whole; that is, in other words, reality as perceived by language can never wholly efface the pre logical choice of being of which it is the resultant. 23. Two kinds of symbolism are amenable to language. They are respectively transcendent and immanent symbolism. Transcendent symbolism is the type of symbolism whose meaning lies beyond the symbols. The meaning lies behind or above the symbols, apriori, absolute and controls the use of the symbols, as it were, from behind. Thus, for example, the Christian scholastic symbolism of the medieval Gothic cathed rals. Gothic symbolism is a kind of spiritual hieroglyphics the decoding of which requires the familiarity with the texts which are embodied in these symbols. The greatest example of trans cendent symbolism is, of course, the Rose Window of the Cathedral of Chartre whose patterns come to light only when 122</page><page sequence="11">Silence and communication the rays of sun shine through them. The precise intuitive expe rience which this symbolism embodies can never be arrived at analytically through inferences from individual objet d'art, but given the intuitive experience the entire pattern falls into shape. From above, the meaning impregnates the individual details with its own significance. On the other hand, there is immanent symbolism where the meaning is enclosed within the individual details. The abode of immanent symbolism is bourgeois art. The progression from transcendent symbolism to immanent symbolism is admirably portrayed in Emile Male's The Gothic Image. Realism is the cla rion-call of immanent symbolism. Meaning here is not prevenient to the individual detail; the individual detail emanates the mean ing, exudes it. Meaning oozes from every pore of the detail but does not flood it, sweep it off its feet as in transcendent symbo lism. Meaning lies within the individual particular rather than above or beyond it. 23a. Meaning is the unity of design. It includes the referential aspect as in transcendent symbolism but is not limited by it. Transcendent symbolism refers to something other than itself. Its meaning slides over its surface to something which it ideally points to. Immanent symbo lism on the other hand concerns its meaning as it-self. Meaning in its referential or expressive aspect is unity—unity of design as well as unity of being. In transcendent symbolism there is a schism within the unity of design and its unity of being. Design is not united with its being. Unity of being has to be critically inferred from the unity of unity and disunity. Both transcendent and immanent symbolisms can be both referen tial or expressive; but ultimately they are each intuitive in origin. The meaning is given at one stroke - the difference lies only within the posi tion and status of this unity. 24. The ideal of language now is an immanent-transcendent symbolism, which emanates meaning in so far as it transcends itself and transcends itself in so far as it emanates meaning. Meaning is an asymptote of being; it again and again returns to itself. It seeks its ground of being endlessly. Tirelessly, it aims 123</page><page sequence="12">INDIAN literature at being self-grounded and fails to do so. Failing, it stops, then tries again. Language carries the burden of Sisyphus, its own self-defeating destiny in its own hand. It is therefore, an endless voyage to its own being. In its very being it multiplies into different worlds, and then in seeking to unify its own diversity it creates the nth world. 25. Poet John Keats wondered how anything could be known by consecutive reasoning. He was right. Continuity in thinking is a purely optical illusion, an illusion born of logic. This accounts for the necessarily fragmentary character of post-analy tical modern thought. Consistency is the internal condition of thought. It is the unity of o le single generative concept. But between one genera tive concept and another, there lies the abyss of silence. Fami liarity with generative concepts creates the illusion of continuity. Thought is ess.ntially discontinuous and disjunctive. Conception is creation or, more aptly, invention of value out of the noth ingness which is human reality. It is an enjoining of relationship of being with itself. Consistency is the internal monologue of the self-exploration of a generative concept. The primary unit of thought is thesis-construction—the imposition of unity by the assumption of identity in opposition. 26. The Paradox of Communication is that it succeeds most when it fails. An expressive act may be defined as being born of a profound failure of communication. Expression is intuitive, that is, silent. In it, momentarily the duality of the communi cant and the communicated, again that of the communicator and the communicee is abolished. The pathos of a failure of com munication bridges the gulf between the subject and the object and establishes a bond of empathic unity. In the silence of com munication is the communication of silence. Essence, now, is incommunicable. It is, therefore, to commu nicate the incommunicable which is the task of communication now. Expression is the very antithesis of communication in the 124</page><page sequence="13">SILENCE AND COMMUNICATION sense that expression is essence become luminous with its own light. Communication communicates itself to an other, to some thing that is other than itself. Expression, on the other hand, is self-limited, self-existent, autonomous. It speaks to itself; it has no other. Communication begins in a lack inasmuch as essence is a lack of being now. It is a silent desire to be, to be wholly within itself. The being of communication is such that it can maintain itself in contradistinction to being only so long as it flees from being. In its fulfilment, it abolishes itself. Communi cation, thus, begins and ends in silence. Expression begins when communication fails. It is ipso facto non-communicative, a sympathetic act. Communication presup poses a threefold partition, namely, the communicator, the com municee and the thing communicated. The metaphor of conve yance naturally suggests itself at this point to one's mind. 125</page><page sequence="14">INDIAN LITERATURE Something passes into another thing like a magnetic charge or an electric current. The metaphor suggests that a more learned person communicates to a less learned person. This invidious discrimination robs communication of its own essence which is that it is a process of identification, again it is based on equality. In perfect communication, there is nothing but unity; an instan taneous, surreptitious broadening of the self, a being-with-the other, a meeting of opposites. Thus, communication proper abolishes the very condition which makes possible communica tion. Modern theories of communication as well as the popular usage which both derive from them and influence them in turn are all false and self-defeating. Communication is never pouring out of information since information is never knowledge. Information is rather dead knowledge or knowledge that is past. The purpose of communication is to recreate or reinvent know ledge when it concerns dead knowledge. 26a. The three-fold partition of communication is ultimately derived from the knower-known schism. There must be a subject who knows and there must be an object of that subject, that is, something that the knower knows. What seems so obvious is, however, ontologically inaccurate. The formal knower-known schism is the apriori condition which when knowledge is perfect abolishes itself. The apriori schism magically transforms itself into aposteriori unity. Knowledge is an act, there is no knowledge, that is, knowledge as a thing, or alternatively, whatever knowledge there is, it is only past knowledge, or knowledge that is past, transcended, outgrown. There is only knowing. And knowing is an abiding unity or unification. Ontologically, to know is to unify. It is in this sense that Jaspers says that truth is not a jewel lying there to be picked up. The substantial character of knowledge is a false, Pseudo-Phenomenon. Knowledge is never information. Informa tion is reified knowledge or past knowledge, 126</page></plain_text>
