<plain_text><page sequence="1">Critique of the Instrumental Interest / in Nature / BY TRENT SCHROYER /jlll modern ideologies of progress share the Utopian pre- supposition that freedom is possible only as a function of emancipation from necessity. While the ideology of "free en- terprise" rests its case upon an ongoing revolution of progress (i.e., socioeconomic development stimulated by ever-new levels of technical learning), Marxist socialism views class struggle as a dialectical self-positing that releases the suppressed technical powers of production. Both are variations within a common unexamined belief that all future human possibilities depend upon an emancipation from the limitations of nature. Terrestial nature, however, has an organic complexity that blocks this myth of reason's realizability. Driving back the limits of nature creates new instrumental controls over nature - but at global costs that are only now beginning to be recognized. The instrumental interest in nature, whether guided by liberal or socialist norms for the employment of technical learning, share the same dated epochal horizons in the categorical relations of nature, freedom, and rational progress. The very generality of these issues makes a systematic pre- sentation impossible. Therefore, the following theses are pre- sented and defended as a speculative critique of the myth of instrumental reason: 1. A new notion of nature is emerging which promises to affect an epistemological change as fundamental as that which resulted in the early modern mechanical analogy of nature.</page><page sequence="2">INSTRUMENTAL INTEREST IN NATURE 159 2. The ongoing instrumental interest in nature has a fateful blind spot to the self-organizing integrations of the earth. Like the remorseless fate of Greek drama, the logic of modernizing development increases its exploitation of nature and destruc- tion of cultural flexibility in the name of rational progress. 3. The origins of modern professional science provide an insight into why the ideology of "pure science" excludes evaluative claims from the scope of scientific discourse. There are cognitive and social reasons for expanding the univer- salism of scientific discourse to the strategic norms of techno- economic development too. 4. Why has Western rationalism been regenerated in the modern era with the motive of world domination? Surveying the views of Ellul, Jaspers, Weber, and Habermas, the sys- tematic suppression of the moral-ethical movement of social learning and the noncritical affirmation of the instrumental interest in nature is found to reciprocally justify Western ethnocentrism. A New Notion of Nature The cognitive embarrassment that "living matter" does not get reduced to physiochemical process is finally being recog- nized as an abstractive fallacy. One by one the metaphysical implications of modern science - such as the dualisms of body and mind, nature and God, empiricism and rationalism - have been exposed to critical clarification and traced to the seventeenth-century exclusion of mind from nature.1 Simi- larly, the reductionist imperative of modern science is now being challenged by conjectures that natural unities, or com- plex wholes, cannot be reduced to fundamental composite 1 In a sense, the argument made here assumes that the philosophy of nature has again become relevant and has a role to play that cannot be achieved by the philosophy of science- or science itself.

Whereas the "organicist" argument has been a recurrent oppositional movement in modern science and philosophy, a more comprehensively interrelated argument begins to docu- ment qualitatively different forms of natural integration.2 Most significantly for international socioeconomic discourse, a new organic concept of the earth is forming.3 If the Gaia hypothesis is correct, the earth is not a "spaceship" to be maintained by human planetary engineers. This technological metaphor continues the unconscious forms of technical con- trol that must be transcended in order to participate coopera- tively in Gaian ecology. "Nature" is not, as the modern myth of progress suggests, amenable to endless interventions that secure socioeconomic development. The Gaia hypothesis was formulated by a space scientist trying to define how to identify the presence of life on Mars or Venus. By modeling the earth's atmosphere, James Lovelock discovered significant differences in the atmospheric compo- sition of the earth in comparison to Venus and Mars. Com- puter simulations based upon equilibrium and steady-state models suggested that the earth's atmosphere would resemble those of Mars and Venus - approximately 98 percent carbon dioxide, about 2 percent nitrogen, and traces of oxygen. But the actual earth's atmosphere composition is maintained at a highly improbable (in equilibrium terms) composition of 0.03 percent carbon dioxide, 79 percent nitrogen, and 21 percent oxygen. From these and other improbable conditions (e.g., the 2 Whereas this argument is the general thesis of this section, some of the most provocative thinking that I have encountered is: Gregory Bateson, Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity (New York: Dutton, 1979); René Thorn, Structural Stability and Mor- phogenesis: An Outline of a General Theory of Models (Reading, Mass.: Benjamin, 1975); David Böhm, Wholeness and the Implicate Order (Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1980); Ilya Prigogine, From Being to Becoming: Time and Complexity in the Physical Sciences (San Francisco: Freeman, 1980); and G.

Although all of the adaptive mechanisms that main- tain the optimal parameters necessary for life are not yet understood, many have been described. These are reciprocally causal compensatory processes that return life parameters to acceptable levels. For example, atmospheric oxygen levels, which are con- stantly increased by the products of photosynthesis, are kept in the 21 percent range by a self-regulating methane produc- tion cycle which absorbs oxygen. In the absence of methane production by bacterial fermentation of the anaerobic muds and sediments of the sea beds, marshes, and estuaries, the oxygen concentration of the atmosphere would rise as much as 1 percent every 12,000 years. (The probability of forest fires starting increases 70 percent for every 1 percent rise in oxygen concentration; at 25 percent, all vegetation on earth would burn.) Increases in atmospheric oxygen lead to over- growth of aerobic microorganisms which in death decay and increase the methane production potentials of the anaerobic microflora at the bottoms of seas, marshes, wetlands, etc. This organic self-regulating control of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is also tied into other complex signaling mech- anisms that extend throughout the global processes of bio- sphere and oceans. Reconstructing these patterns, the con- temporary science of aeronomy increasingly documents the fact that, without life's interference, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels could not be regulated. Thus self-organizing global patterns reveal the self-reproducing goal-adaptations by Gaia - an organic identity that becomes more and more ines- capable.</page><page sequence="5">162 SOCIAL RESEARCH While the Gaia hypothesis itself has not yet been scien- tifically established, its current plausibility provides several highly significant implications: • First, if Gaia exists, then our interventions into the natural environment must become more informed about these self- regulating regulations (for example, how modern increases in fossil-fuel-produced carbon dioxide "impact" upon Gaian reg- ulation mechanisms). • Second, to the extent that we currently do understand Gaian reproduction cycles, we suddenly see that the vital "or- gans" of Gaia are the continental shelves and wetlands where planetary controls are centered in the ecology of aerobic mi- croorganisms and anaerobic microflora that are so important for atmospheric regulations. These ecosystems are of crucial importance for Gaia, and their protection from human de- struction is therefore a primary end for human survival. • Third, what has to be much more thoroughly understood are the morphogenetic symbiotizations within the global patterns of Gaian ecology. Given the global dynamic of an international economic system, the ecological hazards of the too-rapid "de- velopment" of global agriculture seem much more dangerous than previously assumed. As world populations increase, the destructive potentials of agricultural modernization also in- crease in that imprudent interventions in those areas where global diversity and symbiotization is essential for maintaining conditions for terrestial life have unknown consequences. Therefore, more understanding of the "wisdom of Gaia" is needed for the human species to avoid altering some of the time cycles and in-built deviation-counteracting regulations of a global organism whose homeostasis is only now being recog- nized. The Gaia hypothesis remains fruitful as long as the global patterns of goal-maintenance cannot be explained in terms of the laws of their components. No doubt the charge of "teleol- ogy" will appear.4 But if we understand that "teleology" refers 4 As indeed it has: see W. Ford Doolittle's review of Lovelock's book in Co-Evolution</page><page sequence="6">INSTRUMENTAL INTEREST IN NATURE 163 to something that stands outside of a process and yet directs it too, then homeostasis and morphogenetic processes are not teleological. The patterns of reciprocal causality are "tele- onomic,"5 in the sense of goal-directedness according to the operations of informational structures inherent in the forms of organization. Hence, no claim is made that a final end stands outside of the mechanisms of change and directs it by "causing" it to change. Rather, emergence of stable organic integrations are constitutive of organic organization (e.g., homeostasis of body temperature). How a "program" for goal-directedness is acquired is sepa- rate from the teleonomic manifestations of its operations. The fundamental question that emerges is whether the "program" (the informational structure) is an unplanned result of tele- onomic operations of self-maintenance or an indication of a "program of purpose" in nature. The assumption of Gaian theorists, if I understand them, is that the homeostasis of Gaia can be understood only in the reconstruction of the history of its formation on the one hand and by increased global moni- toring of the atmosphere, oceans, and natural environmental regulations (made possible by contemporary satellites and in- formation technologies) on the other. The "program of pur- pose" inherent in Gaia is an unplanned result defined only by the limits of the structure itself. Gaian self-maintaining forms do not necessarily have a program of ^-maintenance - stability and instability are both possible as perturbations of what is defined below as "dissipative structures." Therefore, the possibility that there is a morphogenetic logic to natural history cannot be avoided - that is, more complex patterns of hetero- geneity, differentiation, and symbiotization may evolve.

However, other reviewers of the book find the hypothesis tenable: see K. Mellanby, New Scientist, Oct. 4, 1979; René Dubos, Nature, Nov. 8, 1979; and P. Morrison, Scientific American, March, 1980. 5 Ernst Mayr, "Teleological and Teleonomic: A New Analysis," Boston Studies in the Phüosophy of Science 14 (1974): 91-117.</page><page sequence="7">164 SOCIAL RESEARCH It is also possible to argue the irreducibility of organic inte- grations, such as Gaia, at the level of physical theory. That is, the supposed "universalism" of classical mechanics and ther- modynamics are not able to explain the intrinsic self-organizing activity of organic structures. Such causalities differ funda- mentally from the linear causalities of classical mechanics, which holds that action and reaction are equal and opposite or that like causes create like effects. Classical mechanics provides predictive knowledge where a system can be considered closed and energy transformations viewed as irreversibly tending toward dynamic disorder (e.g., heat processes under the en- tropy principle). But such analysis abstracts from contextual constraints such as organizational information that reacts back or amplifies causal impacts. Although the emergence and evolution of cybernetics since the Second World War has developed a critique of mechanical causation, a more generalized theory has recently added an alternative to classical mechanics and equilibrium ther- modynamics. Contemporary nonequilibrium thermodynamics (e.g., Ilya Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures6) adds to our understanding of biological processes by showing how they can exhibit deviation-counteracting causalities that main- tain nonequilibrium structures that are highly improbable. Such structures subsist against entropie decay, actually increase their complexity, and generate new self-organizing heteroge- neity.7 This new perspective shows that, instead of random disorganizations, the outcome of natural events depends upon the stability of existing dissipative structures regulated by contextual organizational information. Similar conditions do not necessarily produce similar results. Systems that are open to their environment for matter-energy exchanges may tend 8 See Ilya Prigogine, "Unity of Physical Laws and Levels of Description," in M.

Although the entropy law defines a general trend in collec- tions of atoms, molecules, etc., there are implications that point beyond such an order of nature. For one, it differs from the "composite unity" notion of natural order (the microscopic building-block image) by referring its cognitive claims to the patterns of things and to a temporal irreversibility of processes (especially on the macroscopic scale). Thus the theory of dis- sipative structures suggests that the physics of dynamic spatial events is not complete and requires the complementarity of an analysis of irreversible structures too.8 While Ilya Prigogine's efforts to correct and extend theoretical physics were recognized by the 1977 Nobel Prize, their implications for social theorizing are not yet generally understood. I believe that they converge with other arguments to suggest the following: • Qualitatively different insights into the self-organizing in- novations of natural history are possible. The image that sci- entific constructions of natural objects define what nature is in itself (as the world behind our subjective experience of nature) is revealed as an objectivistic abstraction. Bifurcations and instabilities within macroscopic nature force an end to the imposition of geometrical spatializations of events9 and con- 8 See Prigogine, From Being to Becoming. Theoretical physics now suggests that the organic cannot be reduced to the fundamental "primary" laws of the inorganic; "secondary" laws (i.e., nonequilibrium thermodynamics) are seen as equally basic. It is no longer possible to postulate that the rate-processes of trajectories (for macroscopic) and wave functions (for microscopic) are sufficient in themselves, and they must be studied in conjunction with the developing world of dissipative and morphogenetic structures. Such a complementarity will go into the very foundations of theoretical physics itself- as well as be duplicated at every "level of organization" within a self-organizing universe. 9 Critiques of modern science's fallacy of "simple location," or the instrumentalist spatialization of events, has been central to A. N. Whitehead's philosophy of organi- cism. Whitehead argues that the basic physical unities are "concrescent actualities" and resemble a living organism in that they depend not on its components but on the pattern through which they are composed. See his Science and the Modern World (New York: Macmillan, 1925).</page><page sequence="9">166 SOCIAL RESEARCH centrate our attention on the genesis of functionally integrated organic forms. • In a way, the new physics legitimates the old qualitative science argument that a complementarity is needed in the study of natural history.10 This is, of course, what Gregory Bateson suggested by his distinction between entropie ecology (bio- energetics) and "communicational" or negentropic ecology.11 Awareness of relations, patterns, interactive forms, symmet- ries, etc. are essential for recognition of how natural processes are transformed in time. Epistemologically, the pretheoretical sense of future and past turns out to be a more adequate model of "time's arrow" than the cognitive representations of the physics of classical mechanics. "Time" is not a subjective illusion of an anthropomorphic observer but a property of dissipative structures. A theoretical synthesis that attempts to represent the new natural order has been attempted by theoretical physicist David Böhm. He presented the new natural principle as a hologramic enfolding of the information about the whole into each part.12 Instead of the classical Cartesian- Newtonian explicate, or composite, order (where each part has its own place outside of others), the new implicate order implies the hologramic presence of the whole in each part. This changes our percep- 10 That is, both the explanatory laws of physics and the cybernetics of nonintegrable constraints are essential for an account of biological organization. Or the "qualitative science" argument that the observation of morphic forms of organization is a "dialogue" with a patterned order that has been called "authentic phenomena" within the perceptible surfaces of the things that surround us. See Marjorie Grene, Ap- proaches to a Philosophical Biology (New York: Basic Books, 1965) for a discussion of Adolf Portmann's thinking in contrast to other biological theorists who reject the Galilean primary qualities as fundamental for organic life. For a brief introduction to Portmann in English, see "Beyond Darwinism," Commentary 40 (November 1965): 3Î-41. The origins of these perceptually discoverable forms are unintelligible in formalizations. The interaction of life forms shows itself in surface patterns that display an active posturing of life's identity, form, and innerness. Life forms have a centrkity, an inwardness that cannot be reductively explained and insofar as we are ourselves participating within the natural energies that impinge upon us, we are related to morphogenesis within nature. 11 Gregory Bateson, Steps to an Ecology of Mind (New York: Bal Ian tine, 1972), p. 460. 12 See Böhm, Wholeness and the Implicate Order.</page><page sequence="10">INSTRUMENTAL INTEREST IN NATURE 167 tion of natural events away from analytic reductionism toward a new focus on co-present elements within greater wholes. Bohm's concept of implicate orders would instead suggest that inanimate matter is a "secondary, derivative and particular abstraction from the holomovement" for which both life and matter are types of explicate order. The hologramic ordering in nature is enfolded into life and the environment in a more primary and universal way than our analytic fragmentations can represent. The overall consequences of the arguments outlined here converge to restore the primacy of the lived world from which our scientific intuitions originate and return as enrichments of our apperceptions. If these conjectures are valid, then this new way of seeing nature becomes normative for our selec- tions of problem-solving techniques and technologies. But how did we lose this dimension? The Price of Progress The Western myth of human self-creation by the self- correcting problem-solving extensions of material production and technical learning reduce the category of nature to an economic category of a "material reservoir of productive potentials." A critique of this comprehension of progress is Klaus Myer-Abich's argument that the contemporary instru- mental interest in knowledge creates a "blind spot" in that we forget that in relating to nature we are relating to our own biologically dependent existence. When we divide the world into the explicit order of nature (where physics tells us what can be done with the "objects" of our environment) and the economics of the cost of producing these "objects" as com- modities, we form a functional circle that abstracts from the very way we relate ourselves to our own nature via this circle.13 13 See Klaus Myer-Abich, "Practical Philosophy of Nature," Environmental Ethics, Winter 1979.</page><page sequence="11">168 SOCIAL RESEARCH Constructing physical reality by the instrumentalism of what can be done, and by decisions based on the costs of produc- tion, we form our environment by the ongoing extension of our interest in the control of nature. If we look at the logic of simplification that is being imposed on the organic complexity of global ecosystems by the encom- passing power of the international technoeconomic system, the fatefulness of instrumental circle of progress appears over- whelming. As recent debates have documented, international north-south inequalities are forcing a dynamic of rapid technoeconomic development. Less-developed countries (LDCs) are forced into a logic of modernizing development in order to create scarce capital for the competing goals of ag- riculture, industry, energy, and education. Especially in areas of rapidly increasing population, the response now viewed as necessary is greater technical interventions into agricultural production where the present commodity values determine decision-making to the exclusion of ecological consequences. Hence monocultural crop simplifications, loss of soil nutrients and increases in pressures on water resources all compound to further force the less-developed nations to push for immedi- ate increases in their incomes in order to continue the use of these high-energy technical interventions. This leads to defor- estation, overgrazing, destructive cropping practices, deserti- fication and salination (water depletion through increased irrigation), and loss of genetic plant and animal resources as wild habitats are destroyed. The ultimate consequence of such "neutral" applications of science to ever-more-powerful inter- ventions in agricultural production is an intensification of the income gap between the less and more developed countries and an even greater desperation that leads to worse ecological interventions to meet immediate needs. The logic of technoeconomic development imposed by an international economic system evades the evaluation of ecological costs because of the immediate evaluation of all resources as present commodities. Economic rationality pre-</page><page sequence="12">INSTRUMENTAL INTEREST IN NATURE 169 sumes that the commodification of the environment - as the costs of producing a resource and bringing it to markets - also makes ecological sense. But the ecologically necessary components - such as genetic variety supplied by wild habitats - do not have any commodity value in present market evaluation. They are "external" to the costs of private produc- tion. What Western economists are only now beginning to recognize is that global development of "natural resources" is also an ecological problem that requires the recognition of bioeconomic limits. This, of course, does not include the re- cent brands of economics that have emerged to renew late capitalist expansion (e.g., monetarists, "supply-side" econom- ics). The problem with these new instruments of economic guidance is that they have no awareness of the bioeconomic contexts of economic processes and seem to assume that the price mechanism can create matter and energy, prevent ecological crises, and stop social conflicts that derive from the unequal distribution of natural resources and the knowledge and tools needed to develop them.14 But the diseconomies of progress are not only ecological costs - the enforced rationalizations of social communities by the imperatives of capital accumulation also create hidden social and human costs. Since the middle of the 1960s, when the post- World War II economic boom ended, declining out- put, overcapacities, stagnating rates of investment in the de- veloped core have led to a new entrepreneurial strategy based upon investments in the rationalization of the production pro- cess both within core economies and in planned plant reloca- tions in less-developed countries. This new strategy for main- taining capital accumulation on a world scale utilizes the greater technical power that new forms of transportation and communications provide, while also subdividing the produc- tion process so that cheap labor can be used with little or no cost of either training or being responsible for the work force. 14 See Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, "Inequality, Limits and Growth from a Bioeconomic Viewpoint," Review of Social Economy 35 (December 1977): 361-375.</page><page sequence="13">170 SOCIAL RESEARCH New operational breakdowns of manufacturing processes permit the use of unskilled or semiskilled workers over which the plants have more control and less costly responsibility.15 The human costs of this new international division of labor are greater insecurity for labor forces throughout the interna- tional economy. Workers in core industrial-market societies experience more unemployment, plant closings, and, in some cases, loss of their acquired professions. The dynamic in less- developed nations is tied to the uneven development pattern where the modernization of agriculture increases production at the cost of destroying traditional rural communities and subsistence forms of survival. Within core societies, a permanent revolution of progress requires the organization of a political economy based upon ever-widening consumerism. The real increase in use-values when compared to the costs of sustaining endless schooling for job-holding and the long periods of private accumulation for a capital-intensive household bring into focus unrecognized dominations.16 Here too the hidden costs of development are the creation of dependency for which the symbolic gratifications of ever-new commodities do not really satisfy - if the widespread concern for the declining authority of the family is any indication. In the present context of crisis, the Reagan Administration's strategy to dismantle the New Deal while increasing the ideological conflict between East and West brings the world crisis to a new level. As C. P. Thompson argues, the renewed cold war creates a global double-bind situation between peace and freedom.17 The resolution of this crisis will not come from either entrenched technoeconomic establishments or from the 15 See Folker Frobel and others, The New International Division of Labor (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1980). 18 See Ivan Illich's distinction between shadow work and wage labor in Shadow Work (Boston: Marion Boyars, 1981). 17 See the essay by E.

The only social actors that can represent both peace and freedom are interna- tional social movements because they can identify the hegemonic interests and power constellations that make local and regional autonomy impossible. In this sense, the contem- porary peace and ecology movements constitute a new inter- nationalism that rejects the politics of "development" and "na- tional security" where their consequences and costs threaten human survival. By rejecting the logic of technocratic man- agement, and its roots in the myth of instrumental reason, these new movements aim toward a new understanding of international solidarity and human survival. Of course, these movements are still forming, but their current orientation shifts the focus of societal and interna- tional conflict toward a new end. That is, the conflict zones of these contemporary social movements have widened to in- clude the normative ends of socioeconomic development in general. Especially where the relationship to nature is recog- nized as fundamental and as encompassing the north-south, developed- less-developed gap, a new consciousness about nature, freedom, and "progress" is being shaped.18 The peace and ecology movements have a common international interest that is potentially represented by the idea of ecodevelopment. 19 The principle of ecodevelopment is a first approximation to the identification of a universalizable strategy for human sur- 18 Recognition of the primacy of the ecology movement today is widening - see Cornelium Castoriadis and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, De l'ecologie a l'autonomie (Paris: Seuil, 1981) and Rudolf Bahro, Elemente einer neuen Politik: zum Verhältnis von Ökologie und Sozialismus (Berlin: Olle 8c Wulter, 1980). 19 For example, "Ecodevelopment," United Nations Environment Programme Gov- erning Council, Fourth Session, Nairobi, 30 March- 14 April 1976, Item 15 (b) of the Provisional Agenda (UNEP/GC/80, 15 January 1976); Ignacy Sachs, "Ecodevelop- ment," Ceres 42 (November- December 1974): 8-12 and Strategies de V ecodevelopment (Paris: Editions Economie et Humanisme, 1980); Environment and Development (Wash- ington, D.C.: World Bank, 1979); also see Raymond Dasmann, "Eco-Development," Planet Drum Review 1 (Winter 1981); also Robert Riddel I, Eco-Development: Economics, Ecology, and Development - An Alternative to Growth Imperative Models (Westmead, En- gland: Gower, 1981).</page><page sequence="15">172 SOCIAL RESEARCH vivai which responds to the newly recognized organic and cultural complexity of Gaia and the "world-system": • Ecodevelopment begins from the common evolutionary problem of sustaining a global ecology and thus brings before all of humanity the meaning of fairness and justice in interna- tional ecological terms. For the first time in the history of the human species, a truly world-historical situation brings all people together in a common context of interdependence and reciprocity. • Ecodevelopment means the reflexive balancing of the ad- vantages of modernizing development with the real losses of ecological destruction and the hidden costs of increased social dependencies. Instead of imposing Western rationality of problem-solving upon natural communities, a more "dialogic" and innovative mode of learning how traditional knowledge funds and cooperative practices can be interrelated with plan- ning by "experts."20 What is common to ecodevelopment movements is retaining a sense of place and communal practice that cannot be dis- placed by technical imperatives for progress. Such practices also redefine how science and technology can be democ- ratized. For example, it has been assumed by most economic development experts that existing "premodern" stocks of knowledge and endogenous problem-solving practices are unimportant and must be replaced by Western technology transfer and scientized techniques. This assumption is now being widely contested - for example, by viewing science as a learning process which is "in essence an endogenous process, by definition not transferable."21 Without mobilizing local and regional stocks of knowledge about land use, agricultural, and food-storage strategies, endogenous technologies, etc., 20 See "Critical Issues in Development in the 80's," report of a seminar organized by the O.E.C.D., Development Center in Paris, December 1980, No. 7 New Series; or J.

New ways of mobiliz- ing local participatory research to both solve problems and initiate social change yields innovative learning practices- this is the real goal of an ecodevelopment strategy. Ecodevelopment analysis begins with ecological concepts of bioregions, watersheds, and ecosystems.22 These ecounits rep- resent real "unmovable capital" which can be defended against the forces that would commodify them as "natural resources" and subject them to centralized management decision-making processes. The point of ecodevelopment as self-management is to claim the rights of inhabited place against corporate natural-recource planning as justifiable resistance to colonially occupied territories. Science: Value-Free or Normative? A major block to the realization of science as "endogenous problem-solving" is the ideology of "pure science" as value- free and autonomous from any specific normative goal. In this view, science progresses because of the methodological sep- aration of cognitive and evaluative judgments, facts and values. Another view is possible. From the very beginning of the institutionalization of sci- ence in the West, the exclusion of discourse about the norma- tive ends of science has been the social precondition for its legitimacy. An alternative comprehension of science as rooted in emancipatory normative ends was advocated in the seventeenth century by radical English Puritans, who expected scientific and technological research to be applied to the widest possible social reconstruction. In this way, the present 22 See Peter Berg, ed., Reinhabiting a Separate Country: A Bioregional Anthology of Nortliern California (San Francisco: Planet Drum Foundation, 1978). This ideal is shared by John and Nancy Todd, Tomorrow Is Our Permanent Address (New York: Harper 8c Row, 1980).</page><page sequence="17">174 SOCIAL RESEARCH international demand for an endogenous science and technol- ogy simply restates this earlier emancipatory idea of science. Exclusion of educational or social norms for the evidence of scientific analysis can be illustrated in the origin of modern professional science. Formation of the Royal Society23 was actu- ally a realization of a specific type of scientific development that could be maintained in the context of the English Resto- ration. Science, as a socially recognizable profession, began with a "positivist compromise" between Anglican royalism, moderate Puritan parliamentarianism, and the revitalized interests of the monopolies of learning (church, universities, etc.).24 This compromise made possible support for exper- imental inquiry in natural knowledge but in a way which drew rigid lines in the Society's charter against any discourse about political, moral, or aesthetic claims. This denied the radical Puritans' expectations of wide state support for educational reforms which would reorient technical learning toward a much more open diffusion of new knowledge about the me- chanical arts and agricultural techniques. The Puritan reform- ers (e.g., Hartlib) had envisioned a social reconstruction of society from the underside up in which artisan-technologists would be central to technical innovations. Their criticism of the dominance of established church, Latinate university in- struction, and the royal patronage system was the premise for advocating a new organization of technical learning against all social hierarchies. This vision of social reconstruction through a more universalistically oriented learning was infused with a millennial eschatology that viewed learning as the human vo- cation that would usher in the New Jerusalem. However, in the context of the Restoration, the resulting institution of science was viewed as "professional" because it had separated 23 See Everett Mendelsohn and others, eds., The Social Production of Scientific Knowl- edge (Boston: Reidel, 1977), especially the essays by Mendelsohn and Wolfgang Van Den Daele that explore the "positivist compromise." 24 See Charles Webster, The Great Instauration: Science, Medicine, and Reform, 1626- 1660 (New York: Holmes 8c Meier, 1975), espec. pp. 484ff.</page><page sequence="18">INSTRUMENTAL INTEREST IN NATURE 175 "sectarian passions" (e.g., the radical Puritan search for "in- fused knowledge") from experimental knowledge and had relinquished all practical criticism of society. Thus the return of monarchical sovereignty politically determined the ends of scientific development, not internal scientific discourse. This first institutionalization of science also influenced continental academies of science by demonstrating how to legitimate the professionalization of technical learning without endangering the prevailing political and cultural legitimations of established society. Whereas the scientific movement in England, prior to the Restoration, had unified experimental philosophy with expectations for religious, educational, and sociopolitical re- construction, later institutionalization of science in several European countries was done "from above" with little or no relation to an enlightenment movement.25 These origins reveal that the emancipatory interest of sci- ence proved unable to transcend the particularism of modern nation-states. The alternative excluded in the seventeenth century - that is, the democratization of technical learning - is returning today in the numerous countermovements of sci- ence, technology, and the international social movements for peace and ecology. All of these movements take as their focus the need to transform the ends of science into normative questions for public debate. Just as the peace movement is insisting that nuclear weapons be separated from the foreign policies of nation-states, so the ecology movements are insist- ing upon an integration of the "oughts" of natural ecosystems' carrying capacities into the contexts of technoeconomic decision- making. These social movements are effectively as- serting that the orientation of technical learning be con- strained by some strategic norms for the guidance of a sus- tainable form of rational progress. This would change the notion of technical learning from its positivist understanding " J.

This idea has been developed theoretically as the finalization of science.26 Hence the distinction between cognitive and evaluative can no longer be separated on methodological grounds alone. The attempts of positivism and the analytic philosophy of science to do so legitimate the belief in technical progress that unfolds according to the preestablished rules of a universalizing sci- ence. For this perspective, the controversy begun by Kuhn's theory of scientific paradigms is a crisis of "rationality" be- cause there is no certain way to justify choices between theories. What is at stake in this ongoing debate is not rela- tivism but the coherence of a theory of rationality that ab- stracts cognitive content from all normative frameworks.27 An alternative notion of rationality provides a more dialectical notion of science and practical (moral-ethical) truth - or the unity of cognitive and normative truth within the practice of human learning.28 That is, "truth" cannot be restricted to the single sphere of cognitive reference to objects because it is interconnected with our pragmatic capacities to simultaneously maintain and dif- ferentiate normative interactive claims from propositional claims. Our communicative competence for truth-testing ex- tends to the "practical truth" of moral-ethical claims too. The meaning of "practical truth" is revealed when we realize the reflexiveness of what is usually reified as "sentiment" or "cus- 28 See Gernot Böhme and others, "Finalization in Science," Social Science Information 15 (1976); also Wolf Schäfer, "Finalization in Perspective," Social Science Information 18 (1979). 27 See Albrecht Wellmer, "Reason and the Limits of Rational Discourse," in a forthcoming issue of Social Research. 28 See Karl-Otto Apel, Towards a Transformation in Philosophy (Boston: Routledge 8c Kegan Paul, 1980); and Jürgen Habermas, Communication and the Evolution of Society (Boston: Beacon, 1979).</page><page sequence="20">INSTRUMENTAL INTEREST IN NATURE 177 tom." Reflexivity in learning depends upon a shared social world where conventional intersubjective expectations make simultaneous negation a form of self-reference. Participation in a shared social world provides a third level of mediation for any dialogic interaction. Beginning with primate social in- teraction (e.g., play as simulation of appearance simultaneous with its denial), the meaningful contextualizing of language reference by self-reflexive metacommunication29 represents a leap in the symbolic capacity for learning that is hard to recognize, since it is taken for granted. We are capable of communicative learning not as a result of causalistic stimulus- response but from a common form of life. Communicative in- teraction cannot be reduced to the isolated behavior of sender or receiver but presupposes the contextual use of language. Thus in everyday life we naively assume the validity of cogni- tive and interactional claims and in doing so achieve the inter- active basis upon which meaningful speech and action can occur. In every act of double-structured communication, we simultaneously represent objects, express personal intentions, and understand interpersonal expectations - while also cor- relating these predicative and interactive levels. The reflexivity of communicative acts derives from this capacity to simulta- neously maintain and differentiate interactive performances from propositional claims, while also correlating them com- prehensibly. In this way, every common form of life has a counterfactual rational consensual core which is taken for granted in com- municative interaction. Disagreements are then not only dif- ferences in subjective opinions but disagreements about obli- gations and rights, too. If these disagreements are intense, they break the bonds of tacit agreement and release a struggle for recognition which will proceed according to the normative standards for conflict-resolution in the context of the situa- tion. 29 See Gregory Bateson, "A Theory of Play and Fantasy," in his Steps to an Ecology of Mind.</page><page sequence="21">178 SOCIAL RESEARCH If we would orient our everyday practice to only the dimen- sion of cognitive reference, as in the methodologies of profes- sionalized science, we could not maintain a common intersub- jective life- world. That is, modern technical specialists analyze objects in the social world as if the moral-ethical and aesthetic spheres of our social world are merely subjectivistic and/or conventional dimensions not capable of justification or va- lidity. What has to be explained is how modern scientism was able to mystify the consensual foundations of social life and reduce the reference of "truth" to cognitive claims alone. This resulted in the loss of the dimension of "practical truth" in our theoretical accounts of human learning and gave us the strange view of the "value-neutral" human observer who stands outside of nature and communicative practice. The communications paradigm of critical theory implies that the human species "develops" not only by technical inno- vations but even more fundamentally, in terminal epochal crises, by moral-ethical innovations. Transformations of fun- damental insights into nature and society as well as altered social practices extend the universais of collective identity to wider collectivities and more reflexively formed beliefs about norms. In this way, enlightenment movements create moral- ethical innovations that become - sooner or later - the norma- tive resources for more equitable and reciprocal conflict- resolutions. Biosocial Integration Is the Western idea of rational progress compatible with freedom? This is the question suggested by all the above. The best defense of the West seems to me to be Jacques Ellul's: . . . [T]he essential, central, undeniable fact is that the West was the first civilization in history to focus attention on the individual and on freedom. Nothing can rob us of the praise due us for</page><page sequence="22">INSTRUMENTAL INTEREST IN NATURE 179 that. We have been guilty of denials and betrayals . . ., we have committed crimes, but we have also caused the whole of man- kind to take a gigantic step forward and leave its childhood behind. . . . [I]f movements of liberation are everywhere under way, what accounts for this? Its sole source is the proclamation of freedom that the West has broadcast to the world. The West and the West alone is responsible for the movement that has led to the desire for freedom and to the accusations now turned back upon the West.30 By destroying the hierarchies of traditional societies, the West did away with the cultural idea of destiny (or fate) and thus showed the world's poor that their situations were not inevita- ble. Of course, the West has also subjected, enslaved, and exploited peoples while naming this very process of disrupting traditional social identities and forcing people to become atomistic individuals "freedom." But does this modern for- mulation of "autonomy" as the liberty of private economic decision really represent the seminal Western idea of free- dom? Insofar as "reason" is split into cognitive truth and sub- jective normative and aesthetic experience, there are reasons for seeing it as a one-sided distortion of the Western telos. The universalizing spirit of the West combined the notion of au- tonomy with the idea of the cultivation of rational reflection. As Edmund Husserl put it in his Crisis of Euopean Sciences: [The] telos which was inborn in European culture with the birth of Greek philosophy, namely, to be a life-form which seeks to exist, and is only able to exist, through philosophical reflection, moving endlessly from latent to manifest reason and forever seeking its own norms through this. . . .31 The claim is that the breakthrough of Greek philosophy to philosophical reflection was a discovery of what was essential to humanity as such (its entelechy). This thesis is developed on 30 Jacques Ellul, The Betrayal of the West (New York: Continuum, 1976). 31 Edmund Husserl, The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970), p. 16.</page><page sequence="23">180 SOCIAL RESEARCH both the level of sociocultural development and that of indi- vidual human development; that is, it is a thesis of the imma- nent connection between phylogenetic development and the objective potentials for the realization of ontogenetic poten- tials for reflective maturity too. But was this breakthrough to a universalizing spiritual de- velopment achieved only in the West? Karl Jaspers's thesis of an axial age (800 to 300 b.c.), when all the major world religions were formed, including Greek philosophy, puts the potentials for universalism in a much more international frame.32 Wherever the break with mythical cosmogonies oc- curred in ways that objectified the world as a whole, distin- guished the natural world from history, formed the notion of abstract law, and replaced narrative cosmological explanations of the world with opportunities for argumentative discourse, there a potential for a universal form of theoretical knowledge and personal insight occurred. These breaks with myth emerged in China, India, Greece, and Israel. As expressions of universalistic structures of consciousness, they are quite different, and yet each forms an evolutionary turning point from archaic cosmological cultures to "high cultures." But only in the West were these universalisms extended into an expanding and self-correcting learning process. Hence the central question of Max Weber's comparative historical sociol- ogy is: Why only in the West? Why were these universais transformed into the "rationalization" of world views, theoretical-technical learning, and the Protestant ethic (as a methodical practice of life based upon a conscience of inner- world asceticism), in a complex process that began only in the high Middle Ages? What were the reasons for these processes of "rationalization" - or the formalization and extension of these forms of learning in practical attempts to master the world? Why was Western rationalism regenerated with the motive of world domination? 32 Karl Jaspers, The Origin and Goal of History (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1953).</page><page sequence="24">INSTRUMENTAL INTEREST IN NATURE 181 Here the limits of Max Weber's efforts to answer these questions are informative. Weber's work has become the major interpretation of how the rationalization of cultural world views (religion, ethics, art, etc.) are determinative for the per- sonalities of social actors and how these culturally "rational" actions then transform the economic, political, and legal in- stitutional framework of modern societies. The failure of Weber's account is, as Jürgen Habermas has argued,33 the constriction of "rational action" to the teleological model of "purposive rational action"- or the goal-oriented selection of effective means that proceeds with a self-correcting intention. The rationalization of cultural forms (such as religions) yields not only useful purposive-rational knowledge but also evalua- tive forms of knowledge (such as principles of morality or strategic norms). Weber conceives of institutional rationaliza- tion in a way which is distortive of cultural rationalizations in that the intermediating rationalization of "conscience" and "personality" is conceived only in terms of the transformation of cultural rationales (both instrumental and evaluative) into purposive rational action. This viewpoint narrows the scope of historical reconstruction in ways which distort the entire ac- count of why and how cultural universais were rationalized in the West. It also limits an orientation to the future. In contrast, Habermas develops the notion of "communica- tive rationalization" as a dialectical response to Max Weber's concept of the rationalization of purposive rational action - which Habermas calls "instrumental rationalization." This re- evaluates Weber's ambivalent celebration of progressive in- stitutionalization of more effective forms of goal-oriented ac- tion with a pessimistic cultural philosophy of the "disenchant- ment" of the world. In opposition, Haber mas's notion of "communicative rationalization" represents a systematic re- covery of practical (moral-ethical) reflexivity as primary to 33 See Jürgen Habermas, "Aspects of Rationality," in T.

This notion provides an ethical principle for a radical democratization of contemporary societies that reconnects societal processes to the uniquely sociocultural form of human and social learning.34 That is, a communica- tion theory anticipates a rational society insofar as the goals of society approximate a valid (noncoerced) social consensus. Habermas's critique of late capitalism leads back to the rational kernel of bourgeois liberalism as the normative frame against which late capitalism's development is to be compared and extended. The problematic is how to relate insight into the objective possibility of freedom to the already sedimented "negative freedoms" of liberalism on the one hand and to the human potentials for autonomy on the other. By hypothesiz- ing that social integration has been increasingly toward a more reflectively formed consensus, Habermas's outlines for a crit- ical theory have questioned the legitimacy of current techno- cratic social strategies (for both the capitalist and "socialist" societies). Societies "progress" not only in higher levels of technical learning but also in the opening of opportunities for discursive communication in all institutional contexts. The end is the means; the plans for a rational society cannot be drawn, but the critical practices implied by the communicational uni- versais establish standards for libertarian social process that applies to all social systems. Systematically distorted communi- cations limit the development of autonomy - a free society and an autonomous ego reciprocally presuppose each other. But a residual moment of Marx's theory remains in Haber- mas's notion of "social evolution": The dialectic of progress can be seen in the fact that with the acquisition of problem-solving abilities new problem situations come to the consciousness. For instance, as natural scientific medicine brings a few diseases under control, there arises a consciousness of contingency in relation to all illness. This re- flexive experience is captured in the concept of quasi-nature 34 See Thomas McCarthy, The Critical Theory of Jürgen Habermas (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1978) for an excellent elaboration of these complex ideas.</page><page sequence="26">INSTRUMENTAL INTEREST IN NATURE 183 (Natunuuchsigkeit) - an area of life having been seen through in its pseudo-naturalness is quasi-natural. Suffering from the con- tingencies of an uncontrolled process gains a new quality to the extent that we believe ourselves capable of rationally intervening in it. This suffering is then the negative of a new need. ... At every stage of development the social evolutionary learning pro- cess generates new resources, which means new dimensions of scarcity and thus new historical needs.35 The upshot of this is: "Where nature was, let history come" - but whose history? In the context of a hierarchical world system and a finite organic Gaia, the choices for inter- vention into nature are not all insights into the "quasi- natural." What "needs" can be recognized as possible emanci- pations depend upon more than technical objectifications - they also depend upon their normative rightness and ecologi- cal fit. Human emancipation is not pushed onward by auto- matic technical problem-solving. To assume so is to separate the technical learning from cultural and natural contexts and to reaffirm the myth of transcendence of instrumental reason. This further assumes that the human species- especially in its fully developed technological varieties - has established it- self as universal beings who can reason beyond the limi- tations of all terrestial existence (as well as the "limited" tech- nical imaginations of other cultures). Hannah Arendt calls this belief in technical transcendence of the earth, which is so fundamental to modern science, "earth alienation" and views it as the most fundamental revolution of modernity.36 With the transition to universal science, terrestial and celestial phe- nomena were unified mathematically as physics and as- tronomy. Newton's synthesis was made possible by the alge- braic treatment of geometric relations without regard to the age-old distinction of earth and sky. But the history of Western science has recently gone through a qualitative transformation in that the organic 35 Habermas, Communication and the Evolution of Society, p. 164. 38 Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1958), pp. 228ff.</page><page sequence="27">184 SOCIAL RESEARCH hologramics patterns of earth are rediscovered via new cogni- tive forms of cybernetics and mathematical models. These highly generalized theories point back to the sense in which all information has a natural context which can change how events occur. In the present international crisis, the difference between cultural logics of problem-solving may contain a crucial diver- sity essential for new alternatives. Hence differences noted in the cultural logics of problem-solving in Japan and China may be of fundamental importance for new modes of universal social and technical development.37 Because there is no finished science of nature that can reconcile cosmic and organic "nature," a complementarity of approaches is essential to descriptively account for context- specific biosocial integrations. Thus a "communicational" ap- proach to nature is fruitful for the reconstruction of the mor- phogenesis of natural systems (an alternative science) and use- ful for the guidance of ecologically rational design of human- natural interaction (an alternative technology). It is not possi- ble to evade Herbert Marcuse's anticipation of the organic interconnectedness and the forms of human production by reducing it to a "romantic Naturphilosophie.19 There is more to the project of a noninstrumental science of nature than the mystical idea of the "resurrection of nature." 37 All societies' stock of knowledge about nature also functions as a symbolic system situating human society in the human world. In this sense, the order of nature provides a cosmological scheme whose meaning is always being interpretively used as a cognitive and aesthetic resource.
