She headed a British team of scholars in a three-year collaboration with the Hungarian University of Design and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, 1996-1999. Recent publications include essays in the anthologies Art Nouveau 1890-1914 (2000), E. W. Godwin Aesthetic MovementArchitect and Designer (1999), and Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1996). The research for this essay was initiated during her time as a Wolfsonian Fellow in 1997. U s sing three case studies of furniture in The Wolfsonian's collection from 1905, 1923, and 1935, this article examines broad devel- opments within a rich and fascinating phase of Hungarian design. Together, the studies reveal a creative dialectic between international and national tendencies, demonstrating how three generations negotiated issues of Hungarian identity, tradition, and modernity. The first third of the twentieth century was a period shaped by the devastating conflict of World War I, the subsequent dismemberment of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the rise of a conservative nationalist faction in the wake of the short-lived Bolshevik Council of Soviets in 1919. As one might expect, these larger political and socioeconomic changes were reflected in the shifting alignment of Hungarian design vis-a-vis the world at large, a process that can be traced through the successive stories of the three eminent designers featured in this article-Pal Horti (1865-1907), Lajos Kozma (1884-1948), and Erno Goldfinger (1902-1987) -and the furniture they designed. 65 Detail of Lajos Kozma's preliminary artwork for a promotional design for the fashion house Antal and Hosszu, early 19205. Horti, Kozma, and Goldfinger all participated in a cosmopolitan avant-garde, moving freely among artistic centers in Europe and America. In this sense their furniture was not produced in a closed world, with Horti spending significant time in the United States and dying in India, and Goldfinger residing for the majority of his life in London. Yet despite such a diaspora, these designers can also be linked to a distinctively Hungarian tradition, with Kozma's long and prolific career stylistically bridging Horti's National Romanticism and Goldfinger's fully fledged Modernism. The three men moved easily among furniture and interior design, architecture, and graphics, and were actively involved in disseminating their ideas through publications and exhibitions.</page><page sequence="3">Ci; 111- CLa. 66 fig.

The continuities between these designers have been obscured by the construction of design histories from a predominantly Western European or North American perspective. Although their work has been extensively published, exhibited, and represented in Hungarian collections, Horti and Kozma remain little known in a more international arena.' Goldfinger, on the other hand, like his compatriots Marcel Breuer (1902-1981) and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946), epitomizes the way in which emigres have been absorbed into the history of more dominant cultures, often with little reference to their country of origin.2 P1 Horti in America Pal Horti was born in Pest in 1865. He began his career as a fine artist, but following his appointment in 1890 as a lecturer at the Budapest School of Industrial Design (Iparrajiskola), Horti focused on an ever-increasing range of decorative arts. His international reputation was confirmed by medals received at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900- a gold for his carpets and furniture designs and a bronze for ornaments and decorative silverware. Subsequently Horti was charged with overseeing the Hungarian presence at the Louisiana Purchase International Exposition of 1904 in St. Louis, Missouri. Based on the strength of his participation at this event (for which he won a gold medal and a diploma of honor), Horti received commissions from two American furniture manufacturers. Reflecting on Horti's achievements, Hungarian critic Istvan Domotor commented in a 1908 article, "Anyone who is going to write about the early phases of Hungarian decorative art will come across the traces of Pal Horti's talent everywhere... He tried everything, and in everything he tried he achieved a European standard."' The first item under consideration is a long-case clock designed by Pal Horti in 1905 and manufactured by Oscar Onken and Company of Cincinnati for their outlet in the same city, The Shop of the Crafters (fig. 1). The clock was part of a larger set of oak dining room furniture that was the firm's main product line for 1906.4 Horti enlivened the strong, simple lines of Onken's Mission-style oak with colorful inlays of wood, glass roundels, and beaten-copper panels. Onken (1848-1948) felt that such pieces demonstrated Horti's far-reaching influence on the crafts 1. The Magyar Iparmiveszeti M6zeum has extensive holdings of both designers' work in a variety of media, which have featured in a sequence of exhibitions and monographs. The most important of these are Judit Ko6s, Horti Pdl ilete is miiviszete 1865-1907 (Budapest: Akademiai Kiado, 1982); Lazsl6 Beke, Kozma Lajos (Budapest: Akademiai Kiad6, 1975); Judit Ko6s, Kozma Lajos Munkdssdga (Budapest: Akademiai Kiad6, 1975); Eva Kiss, Kozma Lajos, az Iparmiivisz (1884-1948) (Budapest: Iparmuivszeti M6zeum, 1994). 2.

Horti was producing comparable designs at the same time for Charles P. Limbert and Company of Grand Rapids, Michigan, another manufacturer of Arts and Crafts furniture.5 Horti designed the clock at the culmination of his professional career and international repu- tation; it was one of the last pieces produced before his untimely death at age forty-two in 1907. Designed by a Hungarian and manufactured in the United States, the clock is a hybrid piece that relates to progressive tendencies in both nations. Furthermore, the commission, and the way it was promoted and reviewed in the press on both sides of the Atlantic, provides an unusually clear example of the impact of international exhibitions and the agendas behind them. By the opening years of the twentieth century, Hungary had undergone a period of rapid industrialization and occupied a relatively privileged position within the Hapsburg Empire as a partner in the so-called Dual Monarchy that joined Austria and Hungary. Despite the economic advantages and political autonomy this afforded, however, it was a partnership very much dominated by Austria. In response to this imbalance, the Hungarian gov- ernment increasingly sought to challenge Austrian hegemony by embarking on an international style offensive, which meant ambitious participation in world's fairs and other exhibitions abroad. On this international circuit, Horti proved to be a particularly effective ambassador of his country's brand of modern design. A contemporary described him as having a passion to show Hungary to outsiders as a place of culture, and the Hungarians as vigorous and capable of dealing with their own future rather than wallowing in turn-of-the-century angst. He longed to demonstrate that within a couple of decades they had shown themselves able to keep up with foreign peoples, while being Hungarian in all political, cultural and artistic matters.6 Horti had been prominently involved at the international expositions of Paris in 1900 and Turin, Italy, in 1902. At the latter he was hailed as "one of the most zealous advocates of the new trend in Hungary, a Proteus-like, many-sided artist."7 This track record, combined with his experience as a teacher and entrepreneur in so many different areas of the decorative arts, made Horti ideally suited to coordinate the Hungarian installation at St. Louis in 1904. The Hungarian government commissioned Horti to design the architectural envelope for the nation's exhibit within the Manufactures Building and to curate the displays within, which included a dining room setting of his own design. 5. The earliest of the published Limbert designs is marked "St. Louis 1904," which implies that the armchair in question could have been designed for the exposition. The other documented designs for these firms seem to date to 1905, some designed in St. Louis and others in New York.

From Magyar Iparmuveszet, 1904. Collection OmvH Magyar Epiteszeti Muzeum, Budapest, Hungary. Not having participated at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, the Hungar- ian government saw the St. Louis exposition as particularly important in establishing an identifiable and progressive image for Hungary in the United States.8 Hungary was not, however, prepared to invest enough to erect a freestanding pavilion or to dispatch the kind of historical treasures that had been shown at Paris in 1900.9 Given their budget, the Hungarians decided to focus on exhibiting saleable traditional crafts and their high-profile modern equivalents, as they were already trading in these types of goods with the United States. Some of the exhibits selected, such as the ceramics manufactured by Zsolnay and Herend, the colored glasswares, or the array of decorative wrought-iron products, were already familiar to American audiences. Indeed, Horti was able to identify various American imitations of the Zsolnay wares elsewhere in the exhibition. His own imposing wrought-iron gate at the entrance to the Hungarian section in the Manufactures Building had already sold for twelve hundred dollars before the start of the exhibition, with further orders indicating a healthy boost in exports of such decorative ironwork 8. The politician Count Apponyi remarked, "This display of decorative arts is extremely significant for our commercial connections, and shows the work in an international context. The development of a modern style that has been gaining momentum since Paris, is also of great importance to us nationally." Quoted in "St. Louis-i kiallitasunk," Magyar Iparmiuveszet 7 (1904): 215. 9. Other than the decorative arts, Horti was frankly embarrassed by the Hungarian exhibits that were scattered around the various sections of the exposition. Having fought for the principle of independent representation, like many people, Horti felt that this was a missed opportunity, particularly as Austria was there in force.

Louis Comfort Tiffany's products had already made a mark in Budapest and were a recognizable influence on the leading Hungarian stained glass artist, Miksa R6th (1865-1944)." Following the precedent of the British Arts and Crafts movement, many countries, particularly Hungary, explored folk or vernacular sources in their 1904 exhibits. Horti's design for the Hungarian pavilion within the St. Louis Manufactures Building took the form of a modernized, wooden Transylvanian country house, with its characteristic towers, fence, and "Szekely" gate -the latter referring to ethnic Hungarian peoples of the same name (fig. 2).12 This was a brilliant piece of stage-set propaganda that illustrated both the survival of an ancient culture and its role as a source for modern art. For an Anglo-American audience there was the added frisson of Transylvania's bloodcurdling association with Dracula, Bram Stoker's bestseller published in 1897. In the period leading up to World War I, the search for a Hungarian cultural identity was very much tied to the ethnographic exploration and recording of folk arts in Transylvania. This geographically remote area in eastern Hungary was felt to be the country's cultural heartland, a place in which Hungarian traditions had survived in their most distinct form, relatively free from Hapsburg inter- vention. The artist-designer Aladar Korosf6i Kriesch (1863-1920) celebrated Transylvania in a mural over the gateway to the Hungarian exhibit, depicting picturesquely clad peasants on their way to a church in the region of Kalotaszeg (fig. 3). Kriesch saw Transylvania as a "little 10. "St. Louis-i kiallitasunk," 215. 11.

In a similar vein, the Vajdahunyad Castle in Transylvania was re-created in Budapest as part of the Hungarian Millenary Exposition in 1896 and can still be seen in the city's Varosliget Park. The Szekeley were the older of the two ethnic Hungarian peoples who settled in Transylvania. Their vernacular woodwork was much admired and collected around 1900.

W. Seton-Watson's 1908 study, The Racial Problems of Hungary. Like America, Hungary was a melting pot for many different ethnic groups. This may be attributed to the nation's landlocked position at the crossroads between east and west. The rhetoric of the frontier and its pioneers, which pervaded the catalogue to the St. Louis world's fair and those of most other international exposi- tions in the United States, would have struck a chord with anyone from Budapest, itself a relatively young capital. There were at least six culturally distinct minorities in Transylvania, and so it required a degree of manipu- lation to derive a clear-cut notion of "Hungarian" identity. Horti's ability to move between the self-conscious folksiness of the exhibit's architecture and the more sophisticated urban aesthetic of the dining room he exhibited within clearly appealed to Onken and Limbert. While most of the furniture Horti designed for them was in an unpolished, vernacular style, his more glamorous Secessionist mode was played up in the graphics and photographs used for marketing purposes (fig. 4). Just as Hungary's modern, urban style only referenced some of the nation's myriad folk traditions, so The Shop of the Crafters-in a Horti-designed ad of 1905- aimed to pick up on "vibrations" from every state (fig. 5), transcending particular regional variations with an amalgam that would be nationally and internationally recognizable. waM - CtH LIDI AoLOnmgmv (%C&lt;nSADW. iitZ l"|-s i1 a to Ue * ! 1CRAFTERS i|me mro very V SS^IIII K^ M I E k wiI I I I I I h a a * * *4 I I 13.

The aesthetic derived from Hungary's vernacular wooden architecture, which Horti pioneered at St. Louis, was subsequently adapted to both metropolitan architecture and furniture. The wooden spire in particular assumed iconic significance for the group known as A Fiatolok (The Young Ones), as demonstrated in the 1908 linocut by one of its members, Lajos Kozma (fig. 6). This image appeared as the frontispiece of the magazine A Hdz (The House), a focal point for the group. In Horti's designs for Onken and Limbert of 1905, one can see traces of traditional carpenter detailing in the plank construction, the tulip cutouts, and the notched, chamfered, and pierced decoration. Particularly architectonic is the angled shape of the hood on the Onken clock, which is characteristic of eaves and openings in vernacular Hungarian architecture. It was a shape subse- quently taken up in fenestration, doorways, and gables by other designers associated with The Young Ones, such as KAroly K6s (1883-1977) and Deszo Zrumeczky (1884-1917) (fig. 7). One finds similar forms in contemporary architecture and furniture in Finland, a nation to which Hungary was closely related in this period, artistically and linguistically.'4 Progressive Hungarian designers and critics of the time felt that folk orna- ment most clearly expressed both the eastern strain within Hungarian identity - which looked back to its mythic origins in Central Asia - and a connection to nature through stylized floral forms. Many folk embroidery patterns were stitched in strips, side-by-side, with a terminating line at their base, and one can see how these were readily transferable onto the often- vertical forms of Secessionist or Arts and Crafts furniture, like the long-case clock. For Horti, Native American and Aztec sources resonated with associations of ancient Hungarian folk traditions, and the incorporation of"Indian" decoration in his design for an Onken piano in 1905 was 14.

At the St. Louis world's fair he had the chance to observe directly the arts of Japan and China, and the next year he traveled to Mexico and then San Francisco, all the while avidly sketch- ing, collecting, and photographing with a viewu to holding an exhibition at the Museum of Decorative Arts on his return to Hungary. In Mexico, he actually took part in the excavation of Aztec remains.'6 Horti's pioneering interest in American indigenous culture would later emerge in other Hungarian work, such as the 1908 National Theater in Mexico City by Geza Mar6ti (1875-1941), the famous Aztec-mask logo designed in 1924 for the electronics firm Orion by Jozef Bottlik (1897-1984), and a 1912 "Peruvian" rug design by Pal D6czi (fig. 9). Apart from looking to the Americas for further resolution of Hungarian style and history, Horti was on an economic mission. He was to report to the Hungarian government on decorative art manufacturing in the United States, in particular the furniture industry.'7 There was help from Hungarian contacts, such as Arnold Somly6, managing director of the Baldwin Piano factory in Cincinatti. Horti also looked at some of the large commercial firms in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which produced rocking chairs or what he described as "practical and inventive" office fur- niture. Hungarians felt that they had much to learn from America about 15. Schmidt, "Horti Utolso Utjarol," 73. 16. Ibid., 74. 17.

A growing number of young designers had been attracted to the United States by the kind of working conditions described in a glowing account published in Magyar Iparmiiveszet (Hungarian Decorative Art) in 1903 by Jozsef Galanszky, a decorative artist who had moved to New York the previous year. Among the advantages Galanszky described were better living conditions, union- established minimum wages, and the lack of army conscription.'8 A central problem for many designers in this period was how to reconcile the social and aesthetic ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement with the economic and technological conditions of modern life. While many in Europe and America looked to Britain for ideological leadership on this issue, others increasingly saw the actual products of the British Arts and Crafts movement as exclusive and irrelevant. Writing in 1902 about British arts and crafts on display in Budapest, the Hungarian socialist Jozsef Diner-Denes warned, "We are not rich enough, we are not aes- thetic enough to encourage this art," and urged Hungarian designers to turn instead to Germany and America, noting of the latter: The Americans are adapting to modern developments in their arts and crafts. Their purpose is to abandon handcraft and to work only with machinery... This is the realization of democracy in art. The same kind of idea, the same kind of forms for everyone, only the price varies.'9 This orientation away from Britain was consistent with Horti's conclusions 73 about the St. Louis exposition, where he found the German pavilion to be the most modern, homogenous, and well organized.20 He saw designers like Peter Behrens, Hans Olbrich, and Bernard Pankok as representing "the modern style of the future," although he found their aesthetic "too dry, too bulky, too forced and too cold," and felt they needed to inject a little Italianate color and a touch of French refinement.21 Arguably this was the sort of blend that Horti himself was attempting in his designs for Onken and Limbert. Particularly in Horti's graphics for these firms-the advertisements, stationery, and greeting cards -the swirling, organic lines of the frames that evince traces of his earlier, more Francophile style are balanced by a new, more rectilinear sense of restraint and symmetry (figs. 4 and 5). These American manufacturers appealed to the entrepreneur in Horti. Both Onken and Limbert purported to operate their businesses in the manner of William Morris, promoting values of craftsmanship, "truth to materials," and improved working conditions for artisans, all 18. J6zsef Galanszky, "Level Amerikabol," Magyar Iparmuiveszet 6 (1903): 90-91. Designers and artisans there, he felt, dressed better and had more of a sense of self-worth. On the whole the unions seemed to have set fair minimum wages, compared to the dire position of apprentices in Hungary. Another plus was the absence of taxation for the majority of tradesmen. 19.

Horti's 1905 design for what he labeled a "Morris chair" - a type of plain oak, leather-upholstered armchair-paid tribute to the intellectual influence of the British Arts and Crafts movement in both America and Hungary. 22 The time seemed ripe for the introduction of a Secession style that had been tried and tested on the European market, particularly as most Hun- garian commentators felt that America had no modern design to speak of. 23 "The Americans are waiting for designers with open arms, and the better ones are offered fairytale wages," claimed one writer in Magyar Iparmuiveszet. 24 Yet many expressed ambivalence about the frantic speed and naked commercialism of the New World: The slogan of the American people is "business." The Yankee businessman does not feel the need to consider art, unless it be something to trade with, in which case he imports it from wherever it is available in the best quality and quantity.... There is nothing in Europe, in terms of forms or materials, which cannot be copied. They simply do not have time for art.25 This was fundamentally at odds with the lifestyle and art espoused by such purists as Sandor Nagy (1868-1950) and Aladar Korosfoi Kriesch in their colony at God6llo.26 rsn0~~ ~Horti's continuing American adventures were tracked in the Hungarian news.27 On his way home he intended to make a personal study of bronze casting, patination, and enameling, and the domestic crafts of Japan, China, and India, but the trip proved fatal. He arrived in San Francisco just after the earthquake and fire in 1906. There he contracted malaria, which took its toll during his visit to Japan. Finally, in May 1907, Horti was finished off by yellow fever in sweltering Bombay (today's Mumbai). There is a certain self-fulfilling symbolism in the last years of Horti's life- journey. He was one of the first prominent Hungarian designers to head west from the Old World, presaging the veritable flood of emigres that was to follow. While on his homebound journey he delved backward into Hungary's spiritual and ethnographic origins in Asia. In this sense there could hardly have been a more fitting place to die than India. Like the 22. The design for the "Morris chair, library suit [sic]" was illustrated in Magyar Iparmuveszet 10 (1907): 182.

For several decades, ethnog- raphers and philologists had sought the origins of the Hungarian peoples among the tribes and language groups of northern India and Tibet. This was part of a larger search for national identity and of the move toward political self-determination in Hun- gary.28 Horti's remains were transported home, where his friends Ede Telcs and Miksa R6th designed a suitably affectionate gravestone to him in Budapest's famous Kerepesi cemetery. The larger-than-life bust of Horti tops a marker inlaid with stylized gold tulips (a symbol of Hun- garian identity) such as he himself might have designed (fig. 10). Furniture to Dream by: Lajos Kozma and the Neo-Baroque Lajos Kozma was born in 1884 to a family of German extraction in Som- ogy county, southwest of Budapest. He qualified as an architect in 1906, but it was as a graphic designer that he first came to public attention. Throughout his working life, Kozma was closely associated with numerous literary and artistic figures, including Hungarian poet Endre Ady and French painter Henri Matisse, having studied with the latter in Paris from 1909 to 1910. Over the course of a career spanning two world wars, Kozma worked in a succession of styles that reflected Hungary's changing political and economic situation, emerging as one of the most prominent Hungarian designers of his generation. In the 1920s his name was syn- onymous with the development of a neo-Baroque manner that was applied to architecture, interiors, furniture, textiles, and graphic design. As its second case study this article focuses on a 1923 bedroom cabinet designed by Kozma that exemplifies this style (fig. 11). Kozma has been described as picking up Hungarian design at the place where Horti left off,29 but at first sight Kozma's neo-Baroque cabinet appears to have little in common with the austere clock designed by Horti (fig. 1). And yet, the two are not the polar opposites one might expect. 28. The search for linguistic and ethnic roots of the Magyar has been a constantly recurring theme in Hungarian cultural and scientific journals from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day. 29.

Symptomatic of the connection between Horti and Kozma is the I g fact that in 1898 both men dropped Y Os lin their Germanic-sounding names (Hirth and Fuchs) in favor of ida ofmore Hungarian alternatives.30 The continuity is also clear in Kozma's powerful graphic styliza- tions of Hungarian folk motifs and Symbolist literary themes during the period of his association with The Young Ones in the years leading up to World War I (fig. 6). Like Horti, this group was intent on establishing a distinctively Hungarian identity rooted in folk traditions. Kozma's personal commitment to the ideal of Hungarian nationhood was underlined by his active service as an artillery officer throughout World War I and his subsequent appointment at the Budapest Technical University under the short-lived Bolshevik government of 1919. Kozma never lost his fascination with folk culture and Hungarian mythology, but increasingly he also looked to historical precedent to express national identity and the blend of eastern and western influences that was such an integral part of Hungarian design. As early as 1911 he was designing furniture that referred not only to folk arts, but also to the materials, construction, and styling associated with Hungarian and English cabinet- making traditions of the eighteenth century. By the early to mid-1920s, Kozma successfully developed this tendency into a full-blown "folk baroque" manner, and through his teaching he inspired a generation of students and colleagues to work in a similar vein (fig. 12). Although referencing a historically specific style, such designers viewed the experi- mental and dynamic forms of the Baroque as potentially progressive. Moreover, it was associated with the time of Rikoczi (1676 -1735), a Transylvanian prince who had sought Hungary's political independence. The evolution in Kozma's work from National Romanticism to neo-Baroque was theoretically informed by his understanding of how German art historians Alois Riegl (1858-1905) and Heinrich Wolfflin (1864-1945) sought to explain stylistic change.31 In developing broad conceptual tools to present the visual culture of all eras, these scholars deliberately looked 30. Bela Lajto, a Jewish architect with whom Kozma collaborated, changed his name from Leitesdorfer. Aladir Kreisch added the prefix "Korosfoi" to his surname, just as Ede Wigand interpolated "Thoroczkai." 31.

In doing so they challenged the dominant, morally inflected perception that such styles reflected the decline and decay of the cultures that produced them. John Ruskin, for example, the critic who was so influential on Horti's generation, had abhorred the Catholic Baroque as socially and aesthetically degenerate. This changing historiography of the Baroque indicates how the intellectual context in which Kozma was operating differed with that of the preceding genera- tion. Both Riegl and Wolfflin suggested that styles have an inherent tendency to change. For Wolfflin this process comprised a fluctuation between polarities, whereas for Riegl ornament was one of the elements in an endless sequence of transformation, whereby what started as a classical statue, for example, might end up as a carpet pattern. Like the original Baroque style, its revival in the 1920s and 1930s had an international dimension.32 Kozma's friend Imre Kner, a publisher, described how the designer had been looking for "the big style" that would reflect all cultural tendencies in an epoch.33 In the context of Hun- gary, the neo-Baroque certainly expressed the political and cultural identity crisis triggered by World War I and its aftermath. Austro-Hungarian forces had been brought into direct and bloody combat with the Allied powers of Britain and France. Although Kozma had lived in Paris from 1909 to 1910, the Hungarian designer found himself in active service 78 as an artillery officer for nearly four years, much of it on the front in Transylvania. As demonstrated so vividly at St. Louis and in the work of The Young Ones, the folk arts of this eastern part of Hungary had been central to the development of a Hungarian style. But under the terms of the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, this whole region was ceded to Romania, resulting in another layer of complication for designers trying to evoke a genuinely "Magyar" identity. This was particularly problematic for those with family connections to Transylvania or those who had invested heavily in ethnographic studies of that region. The transition was perhaps slightly less painful for Kozma in that the region of Somogy, where he had grown up, remained within the nation's newly contracted borders.34 Transylvania was not the only loss. Altogether Hungary ceded about seventy percent of its territory and sixty percent of its population, and was made to pay reparations. The dismemberment of the Hapsburg Empire meant that Hungarian producers no longer had straightforward access to a large and secure domestic market, and the country retained only a fraction of 32. Stephen Calloway, Baroque Baroque, the Culture of Excess (Oxford: Phaidon, 1994), provides a study of the neo-Baroque as an international style. 33.

In the furniture industry this resulted in a delayed adoption of the mass-manufacturing techniques in which Pal Horti and the prewar government had shown such interest. Kozma was far from averse to mass production. Indeed, his collaboration with the publisher Imre Kner, for whom he developed a corporate design policy in the early 1920s, yielded stock patterns, typefaces, and layouts (fig. 13).36 Together with Kner, Kozma also became a founding member of the Hungarian Werkbund (Magyar Mu"hely Szovetszeg), revamped in 1932; by that time he was designing tubular steel furniture for manufacturers like Thonet. _abe,rc P fig. 13 Lajos Kozma, stock woodcut borders and vignettes for Imre Kner's publishing house, Gyoma, Hungary, c. 1925.

Mass production and large-scale public commissions, however, were not options for the Budapesti Mu'hely (Budapest Workshops) that Kozma had established in 1913.37 Like O_t E their counterparts in Vienna and Prague, proponents of the Muhely intended to create an intimate contact between the client, the designer, and the craftsman, and there was clearly still a small but sufficiently affluent bourgeois clientele to support such an enterprise. This meant Kozma could continue working in different media, maintaining the quality control, craft ethic, and collaborative practices that he valued. Closely related pieces of furniture were produced in small runs or as part of individual commissions. A drawing for The Wolfsonian's cabinet, and another version made of chestnut in the collections of the Hungarian Museum of Decorative Arts, were produced by craftsman J6zsef Krausz.38 Similar pieces were made by another Mtihely craftsman, Karoly Kozma (no relation), who wrote a small booklet in 1925 on cabinetmaking.39 Many of Karoly Kozma's views hark back to English designer Charles Ashbee's 1908 pamphlet, Craftmanship in Competitive Industry, showing the extent to which a British Arts and Crafts mentality still prevailed in Hungarian design circles. Lajos Kozma was part of Hungary's successful, affluent, and well-assimilated Jewish community of the early twentieth century. Many of his clients and associates in the design professions and building trades belonged to this 35.

Like Kozma, many Jewish architects and designers in the opening decades of the twentieth century were passionately committed to the nationhood of Hungary. As a result, the National Romantic style these designers had helped to forge, in particular its oriental streak, became associated with their ethnic identity. The style may be seen as emblematic of the assimilation of the Jewish community in the multiethnic Hungarian nation. By the 1920s, however, the institutional- ization of anti-Semitism had begun.40 In a climate newly dominated by the Christian right, Kozma's Baroque was more acceptable than his earlier National Romantic mode, on account of the style's historical associations with the Catholic church and bourgeois culture. Progressive tendencies were automatically held suspect under Admiral Miklos Horthy's regime (1920-1944), to the extent that more radical Constructivist designers like Lajos Kassaik (1887-1967) and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy chose to operate in exile. The Communist Party, to which Kozma had belonged, was banned in 1920. Correspondingly, there was a relatively large market for more conservative culture, such as neo-Baroque design, that would express stability, prosperity, respect for authority, and identification with Europe as a whole. The projection of such values through international exhibitions and cultural exchange was seen by the &lt;: government as an important means of improving diplomatic and, ulti- 80 mately, economic relations with the outside world. In its shrunken form Hungary could not afford to be isolated.41 To give the neo-Baroque more explicit national connotations, many Hun- garian commentators played up the association of the original style with the freedom fighter and national hero Rakoczi, the Transylvanian prince. The style was, however, unquestionably oriented toward Austria and Germany. It had taken root in the northern and western parts of Hungary during the early phase of Hapsburg domination in the early eighteenth century.42 From that time there had been a steady buildup of resentment in Hungary against Austrian cultural hegemony. Hungary had enjoyed immense political and economic advantages following the Ausgleich (Compromise) in 1867, which established the Dual Monarchy of Austria- Hungary. Nonetheless the nation's need to assert a distinct cultural identity was undiminished- an outlook that fueled the development of Hungary's National Romantic style. Separationist politics and culture 40. From 1920 to 1928, this occurred through the legislation entitled Numerus Clausus, which restricted the number of Jews entering higher education. 41. Hungary's cultural sophistication was also one of the arguments mobilized by Admiral Horthy in support of regaining the lost territory of Transylvania from the Romanians. 42. Kozma would have been familiar with important German studies of Baroque furniture being published around this time, such as Hermann Schnitz, Deutsche Mobel des Barock und Rococo (Stuttgart: Julius Hoffman, 1922); and Marianne Zweig, Wiener Biurgermobel aus Theresianischer und Josephinischer Zeit 1740-1790 (Vienna: n.p., 1922).</page><page sequence="18">fig. 14 Lajos Kozma, view of a bedroom suite for a lady, Budapest, Hungary, 1924.

CL 81 81 were no longer an issue, however, following the dismantling of the Hapsburg Empire in 1920. In other words, the Austrian, and also the Germanic, associations with the Baroque were not problematic following Trianon. Austria had been cut down to size, and German investment proved crucial to the Hungarian economy in the 1920s and 1930s. Even earlier than this, Kozma enjoyed a close relationship with several German publishers, including Alexander Koch in Darmstadt, who since 1914 had been publishing his work regularly in the magazine Innen-Deko- ration (Interior Decoration). It is in such German publications that we find more details about the commission of the "dreamlike and yet unas- sumingly matter-of-fact" bedroom suite for a wealthy lady, of which The Wolfsonian cabinet was part (fig. 14). The scheme demonstrates how Kozma intended individual items to function within a larger architectural or interior conception (perhaps more neo-Rococo than neo-Baroque in this instance). Deemed "as unified as a rococo salon," according to designer and critic Erno Kallai, the suite was an exercise in the orchestration of varied shapes, scales, colors, and textures, which together exuded an impression of restfulness. Observers noted the playfully contrasted elements of excess and restraint, of imposingly dramatic and diminutive features, of white walls and bursts of concentrated decorative detail or strong color. The bedroom suite also exhibited the air of intimate sensuality combined</page><page sequence="19">'. ....: j with airy practicality.43 There were two Kozmas, noted " ';- __-__: Kallai, "one inclining to preciousness and extravagance, m ! .^ _ a bourgeois aesthete of the modern metropolis, and '- 'i.?P"i' another, who takes pure pleasure in a playful, popular naivete full of crackling color."4 The small, gleaming black cabinet was one of a pair symmetrically placed beneath gilt mirrors to either side ... . .-- . , - of a platformed recess facing the entrance to the suite _ig' 15 rse plafr eet(figs. 11 and 14).

Courtesy of Iparmve'szeti Foiskola. Through their animal or anthropomorphic qualities such pieces of furni- ture were seen as having "peopled" the space. In describing such a room, one critic employed metaphors that drew on notions of family values and individualism prevalent in much contemporary writing on domestic interiors. "In the apartment are distinctively shaped pieces of furniture, in different colors, which look to us like animated figures.... Just as close relatives bring fresh life into the family circle with their individual quirks of character, so the differences [in the furniture] introduce an elegant vitality into the unity of the room." A red sofa was grouped together with its "younger brother," a blue armchair.46 Kozma clearly reveled in the theatrical nature of the commission (he had produced various set designs), and its links with the world of female fashion.

Kozma repeated the curtain motif in his early 1920s design for the Budapest fashion shop Antal and Hosszu (fig. 16). While the curtained stage encouraged a voyeuristic gaze, that "look" in fact bounced back at the spectator via mirrors on either side of the alcove and at the center of the inner sanctum. This play on spectator and performer, illusion and reality, inner and outer was heightened by the abundance of reflective surfaces and themes in the fantastical plaster decoration. Above the recess, for example, an exotic nude reclined dreamily beneath a palm tree. The idea of the alcove as a shrine to the revelation of female beauty also was suggested by another plasterwork detail of a miniature cabinet with doors opened to reveal the figure of an Indian goddess. In many ways, Kozma gave tangible expression to ideas he had already elaborated in a sequence of fairy tale illustrations, which were published as Zsuzsa Bergengociaban (Susie in Fairyland) with text by Frigyes Karinthy in 1921 (fig. 17).47 Kozma had drawn the pictures for Susan, one of his daughters, during his military service on the Transylvanian front in World War I. Accessing this fantastical dream world that he so playfully filled with light, color, and familiar furnishings must have helped him cope with the wartime situation. Kozma tended to work things out on paper, devel- oping ideas quickly and giving full rein to his imagination. Like Horti, he had been trained in a system of design education, closely related to British models, which encouraged the development of proficiency in different branches of the decorative arts and architecture. Furniture design was only one of the areas in which both of them excelled. In Kozma's case, 47.

Later in his life, Goldfinger reflected back upon his expe- rience as a teenager, writing: "One student left Pest to find his fortune, somewhere."50 While retaining strong Central European contacts, like many other peripatetic Hungarians at the time, Goldfinger merged, chameleon-like, into avant-garde circles -first in Paris, then in London, having moved to the latter in 1934. He was to "find his fortune" in London, becoming best known for his postwar architecture. Following the public opening in 1996 of his home in Willow Road, designed 1936 to 1939, Goldfinger has gained prominence for his furniture and interiors of the 1930s (fig. 21).51 This was the period in which he designed the third highlighted object of this study, a sideboard, as part of an interior modern- ization for the north London home of a couple named the Benroys (fig. 22). Goldfinger designed new furniture for several rooms, and the sideboard was one of three made for the dining room. One of the other sideboards from the Benroy residence is in the collection of London's 86 Victoria and Albert Museum.52 Goldfinger was the least self-consciously Hungarian of the three designers featured in this article, which was, in part, a reflection of his commitment to International Modernism. Nevertheless, it is possible to demonstrate that Hungarian culture and contacts remained important to him. In addition, Goldfinger's work was known in Hungary, and he shared preoc- cupations with designers who continued to work there. In many ways there were direct parallels between the reception and development of Modernism in Britain and Hungary. There was an essential conservatism in both countries, and initially Modernism often found expression in domestic commissions for individual clients. Before moving to Budapest, Goldfinger had spent much of his childhood in Transylvania, where his family owned forests and sawmills. Like Horti and Kozma before him, Goldfinger was drawn to record the country's folk culture. Among his papers from the 1920s are sketches of traditional 49. UjEpiteszet2- 3 (1949): 44. 50.

Hungarian houses, dress, and ceramics.53 In a drawing of 1925, Goldfinger juxtaposed a Hungarian and a Mexican peasant, alluding to the interna- tionalism of folk culture in a way that is reminiscent of Horti's two decades earlier. At the time, however, Goldfinger was studying in Paris, where the architect Le Corbusier was expounding a more radical view relative to the appropriation of vernacular culture. In the same year as Goldfinger's drawing, Le Corbusier wrote: We grow certain that the folklore of today is in the process of formation, indeed already exists, born of unanimous collaboration. But the idle and the sterile plagiarize the folk cultures of the past, fill the air with the deafening cries of crickets, and sing out of tune with the songs and the poetry of others.54 This critique would not have been lost on Goldfinger, who had interviewed Le Corbusier for a Hungarian newspaper and, together with other students dissatisfied with the conservative teaching of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, had approached him to set up a breakaway atelier. Instead, they ended Ci; 111- CL 87 53. Goldfinger, "Juvenalia." Like Horti and Kozma, Goldfinger designed several ex libris plates (bookplates), a form of graphic art that had maintained its popularity at all levels in Central Europe while declining to something of a curiosity in the West. 54.

The young Goldfinger also was influenced by the Viennese designer Adolf Loos (1870-1933), with whom he had visited the 1925 Exposition Interna- tionale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts). For Loos, the suppression of ornament was a sign of intellect, and sensuality was implicit in materials themselves. In Paris, Goldfinger set up a small practice with fellow Hungarian Andras Szivessy (1901-1958).55 Elements of the furniture they designed together in the late 1920s would reemerge in the later Benroy sideboard. Among these were the cast iron supports and tambour doors, the latter an elegant and traditional feature of French cabinetmaking. They also worked on a range of shops and exhibition stands, including Goldfinger's first London commission, a salon in Grafton Street for cosmetician Helena Rubinstein (fig. 23). The design was streamlined and austere, but suggested opulence in its combination of Bakelite, chrome, and stainless steel furniture. Apparently, Rubinstein thought it had "just a slight appearance of an operating theatre." Goldfinger's response, delivered in his somewhat rudimentary English of the time, indicates an approach that would also inform the design of the 1935 sideboard: We don't believe in a decoration applicated [sic] arbitrary... The stuff a20~~~~ ~~we are doing is simple and plain and gets all its value of the balance of its ~~~~~88 ~~proportions of the perfect satisfaction it gives in fonction [sic], of the materials in their right place.56 A contributor to the journal Ter es Forma (Space and Form) felt that the design concepts of Goldfinger and Szivessy's shop furnishings were familiar to a Hungarian audience, but what gave the partnership an edge was their ability to work with a higher quality of materials and craftsmanship in Paris than in Budapest.57 At this stage they were still referred to as "Hungarians working abroad." It was noted, however, that "these two Hungarian architects have soaked up a lot of Gallic culture,"58 consistent with a decisive orientation in Hungarian architectural circles toward French and German models by the late 1920s. Such intellectual currents were familiar not least through the prominent involvement of Hungarians in both the Bauhaus (Marcel Breuer, Farkas Molnar, Jozsef Fischer) and the Hungarian chapter of CIAM (Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne), the association promoting International Modernism that included Le Corbusier and was established in 1928.59 In 1927 Goldfinger 55.

The Gordon Russell Trust, Broadway, Worcestershire, England. and Szivessy entered a competition run by the Austrian furniture manu- facturer Thonet. They submitted designs for a wardrobe, which had a space at the top for filing clean shirts and a ventilated bin below for dirty laundry. Admired by Le Corbusier, the firm of Thonet had factories and showrooms in Budapest and manufactured many furniture designs by Hungarians, such as Kozma and Breuer. Goldfinger began his furniture design process by analyzing function and user needs. This was most apparent in his solutions to clothes storage, but in a similar vein the drawers both of his own and of the largest Benroy sideboard were custom fitted with felt-lined trays for each piece of the family's silver cutlery.60 Following Goldfinger's relocation to London in 1934 with his wife, Ursula, he became one of several Continental architects who helped establish the Modern movement in England. Other famous Hungarians who spent time in London in the mid-1930s before moving on to reinvent themselves in the United States were the Korda brothers, Marcel Breuer, and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. The market was still slack for major architectural projects, with the result that Breuer and Moholy-Nagy were chasing the same sorts of design work as Goldfinger, predominantly for furniture, shops, co Ql- c 89 60.

Jack Pritchard, who had founded the Isokon furniture company and worked with Breuer, felt this was not going far enough. In his view the sideboard was a redundant piece of furniture symbolizing all that was wrong with the middle classes: "What would I want with a sideboard? I wouldn't have one in the house," from an interview quoted in Rosamund Allwood and Kedrun Laurie, R. D. Russell and Marian Pepler (London: Geffrye Museum, 1983), 8. ''' "' ,...

In Gordon Russell Ltd., Goldfinger found a sympathetic furniture com- pany with which to work.61 Their new showrooms at 40 Wigmore Street, London, had opened in October 1935, and contract sales like the Benroy commission were now the lifeblood of the firm rather than the moderately priced modular furniture they had introduced with limited success (fig. 24). The parent company in the town of Broadway, Worcestershire, a site close in place and spirit to Chipping Camden, where Charles Ashbee had set up his Arts and Crafts movement Guild of Handicraft, still concentrated on the production of rather staid natural-oak furniture in a traditional but modern style. The London branch projected a more cosmopolitan and unequivocally Modernist aesthetic, introducing German wallpapers and Thonet furniture alongside the firm's own productions. Gordon Russell's new London buyer was none other than Nikolaus Pevsner (1902-1983), who was on the point of publishing his seminal study, Pioneers of Modern Design. Wigmore Street, in the West End of London, attracted a reason- ably affluent avant-garde clientele, consisting in part of the Central European (often Jewish) emigres who lived in the area. In 1936 Goldfinger designed a shop down the road from Gordon Russell for the toymakers Paul and Marjorie Abatt, who, like Gordon Russell, also sold products by emigre Modernist designers. In his book British Furniture To-day, published in 1951, Goldfinger talked about mass production as the "basic feature of modern furniture." He also described machines as having utterly changed everyday life. This did not really tally with his experience. While Goldfinger viewed all his furniture designs as prototypes, few were put into wider production. The modular units he designed for Easiwork, a London firm of furniture manufacturers specializing in hygienic and laborsaving products, however, were an exception. At the 1937 Ideal Homes Exhibition in London, for example, Goldfinger designed the firm's stand in the form of an "All-In" Bungalow containing standardized modular cupboards with rolling shutter fronts (like those in the Benroy sideboards), which functioned both as storage units and wall dividers. It is questionable whether the Benroy sideboard would have been suitable for replication. The piece evoked the idea of functionality and reproducibility in its rigorous geometry, but the combination of materials meant that it was never a very practical design. The marble slabs cladding the cupboard are incredibly heavy, and are attached to the wooden carcass by the flimsiest of means, making the item extremely difficult, if not dangerous, to move.62 In both The Wolfsonian 61. See Allwood and Laurie. They were the only British furniture makers to be illustrated in Ter es Forma at this time, incidentally in an article by Kozma. 62. On each side of the smaller cabinets, a comparable patch is missing, suggesting that in their original location they might have been fixed to the walls.</page><page sequence="28">and the Victoria and Albert examples, pieces of the marble have become detached. Furthermore, the alignment of the metal legs flush with the extreme edges of the sideboard gives only minimal support to the main span of the structure, and adds to the strain at the juncture between the legs and carcass. In the Victoria and Albert example, this inadequate support has been addressed by adding two bars across the width of the piece, joining the two legs. The iron has not aged well, having corroded in places, and its silver paint has flaked off. Given such flaws in the design of this custom-made sideboard, there is a certain irony in Goldfinger's comment that, owing to mechanized production, "Exquisite craftsmanship is no longer required, nor obtainable in the old sense."63 It was certainly not a piece designed with cabinetmaking skills or the sort of sensitivity to materials and construction that Kozma had demonstrated. Perhaps part of the problem was that Goldfinger's design was so over- whelmingly architectural. With its compact and controlled geometry, its low, broad proportions, and its main volume hovering on slim supports, the sideboard may be compared to the exterior of Goldfinger's residence on Willow Road (figs. 21 and 22). The slats of the sideboard's tambour doors can be read in tandem with the vertical wood cladding on the ground floor bays of the building. Also comparable is the sensual appeal arising from the juxtaposition of the contrasting temperatures, colors, and textures in the different components. In Willow Road, the natural qualities of the wood and brick are played off against the cooler, modern associations 91 of the shuttered concrete columns and steel window frames, while in the sideboard the marble and mahogany (natural materials associated with luxury and a tradition of high-class cabinetmaking) are contrasted with the mass produced and industrially resonant cast iron base supports. Goldfinger delighted in such juxtapositions of traditional and less-familiar materials, with their opposing tactile and cultural connotations. This was, in his view, what raised furniture design beyond the search for meeting physiological needs. The English artist Paul Nash (1889-1946) also saw this as characteristic of the modern room, writing in 1932: In the differing surfaces of metal and wood, glass and paper, stuff and stone, we derive pleasure, not only from actual contact, but by the sensation, which perception supplies through sight. To sit idly, in a well-proportioned room, furnished even economically, from the immense store of different materials available to-day; to feel through the eyes, the subtle contrasts of texture and temperature; is surely something of a new pleasure.64 Goldfinger felt Willow Road had an affinity to the Georgian and Regency architecture of London, which had impressed him from the time of his 63.

Paul Nash believed, too, that furniture and interiors should pick up where the Regency had left off, expressing corresponding values without imitation. It is interesting, therefore, that, in a Hungarian article entitled "The old and new objectivity," the early nineteenth-century, Regency-era furniture of Johann Wolfgang Goethe's sparse Weimar study was seen as the stylistic precedent to furniture by Goldfinger and Szivessy.65 In the Benroy sideboards the combination of mahogany and green marble- which Goldfinger also used in the living room hearth at his Willow Road home-would not have been out of place in a Regency interior. Signs of Goldfinger's Hungarian origins were still to be found within the startling Modernism of Willow Road. Once Goldfinger's children moved out of the nursery, his mother, Regine, moved to the top floor of the house. She remained there until her death at the age of 101, resolutely speaking Hungarian, and surrounded by the swelling forms of eighteenth-century 65.

Yet by 1937, Goldfinger had become so identified with London that he was asked to design the children's section in the British Pavilion at the international exhibition in Paris.66 Horti, Kozma, and Goldfinger were connected by a web of biographical and aesthetic factors. All three demonstrated extraordinary flexibility in working with different genres and media, and were influential as theorists and educators. They responded sensitively to the sociopolitical and economic circumstances of their times. Their furniture clearly resonated with broad orientations in the visual culture of the period. Horti and Goldfinger are representative of the role of Central European designers in the formation of a Modern idiom in both America and Britain. Kozma worked with the folk aesthetic of Horti and the Modern aesthetic of Goldfinger, but gained broadest recognition for his resurrection of the Baroque. It would be easy to construct a linear narrative extending from the rational simplicity of the Onken clock to the standardized geometry of the Benroy sideboard, in which Kozma's cabinet appears as a temporary diversion or disruption. On the other hand, the latter can be taken to highlight another constant strand in the development of a Modern sensibility in its celebration of more feminine, sensual, and theatrical values. o Acknowledgments Apart from the patience and generosity of colleagues at The Wolfsonian, this article would not have been possible without the help of many people in both Scotland and Hungary.

Goldfinger's design, with its cutout clouds and rather sinister planes in the sky, is reminiscent of Kozma's surrealistic response to World War I through his illustrations for a children's fairy tale.</page></plain_text>
