<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS IN THE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT OF KNOSSOS, 1957-60. PART I (PLATES 28-67) INTRODUCTION THE excavations described here were undertaken for the purpose of obtaining a fuller know- ledge of the nature of the Neolithic settlement site which lies below the Minoan palace of Knossos. The presence of this settlement site was originally recognized by Sir Arthur Evans very soon after he began work at Knossos at the beginning of the century. His numerous soundings estab- lished that it was of considerable size, covering the whole of the hill of Kephala below the palace and the surrounding houses (an area of at least I I acres), and that it must have endured for a long period, since the depth of deposit attained to nearly I0o metres in places.' A pottery sequence was worked out by Mackenzie on the basis of the soundings carried out up to 1904,2 and this was subsequently adopted in essentials by Evans in the final publication. It has subsequently been refined and modified by Dr. A. Furness (Mrs. Ozanne), using Evans's material in the Stratigraphical Museum, in a paper which she published in this journal in 1953.3 In 1923 Evans cleared the foundations of some Late Neolithic houses which lay almost on the surface of the Central Court,4 but apart from this nothing at all was known of the architecture and layout of the settlement. The other soundings were all too small to produce architectural remains, and were aimed simply at sampling the pottery and other material. The object of the new sounding was to remedy in some degree this situation and at the same time to check the pottery sequence by the excavation of a small area of the settlement down to bedrock. The work was begun in 1957 by M. S. F. Hood, then Director of the British School, as part of the School's programme of excavation at Knossos.s At his invitation I took over control of the work in 1958 and continued with it until the completion in 1960.6 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EXCAVATIONS The sounding was begun in August 1957 in an area i I by i i metres in the northern half of the Central Court of the palace. This was divided into four squares of 5 metres, which were called A, B, C, and D, with baulks I metre wide between them (FIG. I and PLATE 28, 2). The top of a paving stone of the Minoan Court which lay on the west edge of Square B was taken as a datum with a height of o metres (FIG. 2). Patches of pebble paving and fragmentary walls belonging to Stratum I and the upper part of Stratum II were uncovered in this season (FIGS. 20 and 21).

Weaver (I959 and 1960); as field assistants, H. Thrane (1958), Mrs. C. Bennett, Countess W. Armfeldt, Miss G. de Bogaarde, B. Kite, M. S. Hacker (I959), Miss J. Close-Brooks, Miss M.-J. Mountain, P. Baird (196o), and P. J. Ucko (1959 and 196o). My wife controlled the sorting of the pottery and the domestic arrangements during all three seasons, as well as helping on the site. Thanks are due to the Faculty Board of Classics, Cambridge, the Crowther-Beynon Fund of the Department of Archaeology, Cambridge, and the British School at Athens for financial support. The Central Research Fund of the University of London provided grants to cover the cost of my travel to and from Greece for each of the three seasons, and also in 1962 for the study of the excavated material.</page><page sequence="2">EXCAVATIONS IN THE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT OF KNOSSOS, 1957-60. PT. I I33 In the following year the work was continued during May and the first part ofJune. Opera- tions this year were on a small scale; excavations were undertaken in only two of the four squares, c and D. Late Neolithic walls in Stratum II were uncovered in D (FIG. 20 and PLATE 40, 3), and two pits full of crushed pots were found, one in c and one in D, in the top of a domed mound of yellow clay which covered both squares (FIG. 20 and PLATE 39, 2 and 3).

SKETCH PLAN OF THE PALACE AT KNOSSOS, SHOWING POSITION OF THE SOUNDINGS AND LINES OF THE SECTION the product of the collapsed walls of a building, and its removal revealed the presence of House A in Square D. By the end of the season the greater part of the room had been uncovered (PLATE 38, 2). The pottery from the pits was of Middle Neolithic type and provided a welcome series of reconstructible vessels of this phase (FIGS. 40,4; 41, I ; 42 and 43; PLATES 43, 5, 6; 44). The pottery associated with House A was of the same phase. In Square c the wall of a slightly later structure was uncovered where it projected slightly from the south face of the Square (PLATE 37, 5), while in the north-west corner of c part of a wall apparently contemporary with House A was identified. The 1959 season covered August and the first half of September, and in this year work was carried on in all four squares. In Square B the remains of House B (FIGS. 16; 19 and PLATES 40,</page><page sequence="3">134 J. D. EVANS I-2, 4) were uncovered and the baulk between Squares B and c was removed to allow the ex- cavation of more of House A. To complete the clearance of House A, and to help in establishing its exact temporal relation to B, it was then found necessary to extend the newly created Area BD to the north. Accordingly a 2-metre strip was laid out on this side and excavated down to the level of the rest of the area. The result can be seen on the Plan (FIG. 16). A combination of evidence showed finally that House B was slightly later than House A. Pottery found on its floor was scanty, mainly of Middle Neolithic type, but with some sherds which seemed to show signs of the beginnings of development towards Late Neolithic. The two structures established the existence of two building levels, A and B, in Stratum III, confirmed by the existence of two suc- cessive walls belonging to this stratum in the south face of Square c (PLATE 37, 5)- In Square A little of architectural interest was found in this season, apart from a section of the Stratum III B wall which had been identified the year before in the north-west corner of Square c. A short section of its return to the south-east was also found, but this broke off abruptly (FIG. 2). The main interest here was provided by the large number of figurines found in the thick debris of stratum IV (Early Neolithic II). Meanwhile, in Square c excavation was continued through the Early Neolithic II levels into those of Early Neolithic I. For some time there were no archi- tectural remains apart from a very flimsy clay wall in Stratum IV (FIG. 14 and PLATE 36, I), and few other features except for a few built hearths (FIG. 14 and PLATE 36, I) and some curiously shaped hollows in Stratum V (FIGS. 12 and 13 and PLATES 35, 2-3). Finally in Stratum VII a room of House c was uncovered (PLATE 32, I). By then there was very little of the season left, so a small area I metre square was chosen in the north-east corner of the square and excavated down to bedrock. It lay just outside the area covered by House c. By chance this patch covered Pits A and B in the top of Stratum VIII (FIGS. 4, Io, II and PLATE 31, 3), and in these were found two complete or reconstructible pots (FIG. 39, nos. 2 and 4, and PLATE 41, nos. 2 and 3), and two marble figurines (FIG. 63, nos. 15 and 16). In this season also the remains of Sir Arthur Evans's Late Neolithic houses were re-exposed, and a shallow trench was cut to link them up with the stratigraphy of our sounding. This established quite clearly that they were built above the layer of yellow mud produced by the collapse of structures in our Stratum II, which could be followed all the way. They were therefore later than any structures found in our sounding except, perhaps, the portion of a building belonging to Stratum I found in Square D in 1957 (FIG. 2 I). It was not possible to be quite certain whether they were contemporary with this or even later. At the end of the 1959 season it was decided to carry only Squares A and c down to bedrock, and so Squares B and D were abandoned and filled in. The final season in 196O covered exactly four weeks in August, ending at the beginning of September. Work began with the excavation of Square A down to the same level as was reached in the major part of c the year before, and the removal of the baulk between them to create Area AC. Some small structures were found in A in Stratum V (FIG. I2 and PLATES 34, 3, 4 and 35, 1), but little else of architectural interest until the level of House c was reached, though a series of very small stone and shell figurines lent additional interest to the Stratum V deposit (FIG. 62, nos. 9-12, pp. 162 and 237). In Stratum VII a second room belonging to House c was identified which appeared to have a common entrance to the north, and presented some features of special interest (FIG. II and PLATE 32, 2). The whole area was then excavated down to bedrock, which was a little over a metre below the level of House c. Below the lowest floor associated with House c the nature of the deposit underwent a radical change. This was determined by a change in the building techniques used, from the universal use ofpisi laid on a stone and kouskouras foundation to the use of fired mud-brick. Down to this point the composition of the deposit had been pretty uniform, consisting</page><page sequence="4">Datum 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 metres FIG. 2. PLAN SHOWING THE TOTAL AREA EXCAVATED DOWN TO STRATUM III IN THE CENTRAL COURT, AND THE STRUCTURES UNCOVERED</page><page sequence="5">136 J. D. EVANS of levels of yellowish clay derived from the walls of collapsed buildings, which were almost sterile of finds, alternating with darker levels consisting chiefly of occupation refuse, which were relatively rich in finds of pottery and other objects. The two following Strata, VIII and IX, were much more colourful, since the deposit consisted largely of the debris of broken mud- bricks which had been fired to a variety of different colours. In Stratum VIII a very much damaged structure (House D) was found. Only scanty remains of two of the walls survived, with a hard mud floor between (FIG. IO and PLATE 3 I, 2). The west wall of this structure was made of mud-bricks, but seemed to be only one brick thick; the east WELL  a m -t m In J.D.E, 1963 V) wn w I- w FIG. 6. SECTION OF THE WEST SIDE OF TRENCH XY wall was simply a mass of clay, with no individual brick visible, at least up to the height to which it had survived. All traces of a wall on the north side had vanished completely. The main feature of this building was the existence of the bases of two structures, possibly ovens, in the centre of the floor (PLATE 3I, I). Below this structure was Stratum IX, in which we found the remains of a trapezoidal room with walls built of mud-brick (House E), with a narrow doorway on the western side, blocked up with stones when found, and a floor which, at least at one stage, was on two levels, with a slightly raised section at one end (FIG. 9 and PLATE 30, 4). There was also another brick wall in this stratum at the eastern end of the area. Below these remains was Stratum X, which was a shallow deposit of dark earth resting on bedrock. There were no remains of any structures, but many pits and some post- and stake- holes were found (FIG. 7 and PLATE 29, 2). The deposit appeared to consist chiefly of domestic refuse. Carbonized grain was found scattered widely over one part of the area, and this ap- peared to be in some way associated with a row of stake-holes (FIG. 7). Remains of six young children were found in this deposit below the west end of House E. They appeared to belong to it, however, and not to have been introduced from above (FIGs. 7 and 8 and PLATE 29, I, 3, 4). A seventh skeleton of a child was found some distance away to the east laid in a small pit cut into bedrock and covered with a stone (PLATE 30, 1-3). The complete absence of pottery from this stratum was a very striking feature.</page><page sequence="6">FIG. 3.

EVANS Area F, adjacent to the main sounding to the south (FIGs. 2 and 18), was opened up in this season to provide further information about the building which was known to be in this area from the portion of wall which projected from the south face of Square c. It proved to be larger and more elaborate than any building found in the main sounding, with various rooms, corridors, and perhaps open courts (FIG. 18), and it seemed, as expected, to belong to Stratum III A. Unfortunately it was not possible to explore it adequately for lack of time, though there seems no doubt that it would well repay further investigation. A further small sounding was made in 196o to test the nature of the deposit near its limits and as far away from the central part as possible. The spot chosen was to the north of the Central Court beyond the palace in an area of Minoan houses near the northern edge of the hill. This sounding, called xY, was much restricted by the remains of Minoan house-walls which had to be left intact. It took the form, initially, of two narrow trenches, x and Y, in line, with a baulk left between. Each was I metre wide and 3-5 metres long. Soon it became evident that a great part of the southern one, Y, was taken up by a Minoan well which had been cut down through the Neolithic deposit, so the baulk was removed and the two trenches joined together. The surface layers of the undisturbed part of the deposit produced Middle Neolithic pottery, but no structures. Below these there were three building levels, all characterized by pottery of Early Neolithic II type, though with some admixture of sherds of Early Neolithic I type in the lowest of these. Practically the whole of the deposit, therefore, belonged to Stratum IV. The walls found in the two upper building levels were not particularly informative, though they were obviously parts of houses which had the same orientation as those of the Middle Neolithic in the Central Court (FIG. 15, I and 2, and PLATE 37, I and 2). In the earliest building level, how- ever, were the remains of the well-preserved corner of a rectangular room, having the same orientation as the later ones, and 'cupboards' containing storage jars at each corner (FIGS. 15, 3 and 14A; PLATE 35, 5). There was no real Early Neolithic I level. The most striking general feature of the architectural remains uncovered during the whole of this work is the consistency with which, down to Stratum IV, the walls appear to be orientated in the same direction in all parts of the site. This seems to indicate some sort of overall plan which was adhered to over a long period of time. The buildings found in the Early Neolithic I strata did not have this common orientation, though it was noticeable that they did not vary very greatly from it. The results obtained in the very small sounding xY seem to indicate that the Early Neolithic I settlement was perhaps considerably smaller than that of Early Neolithic II at least. The lack of architectural remains of the Middle Neolithic period here, and the complete absence of late Neolithic material, might be due to later settlements' having dwindled again in size, but it could also be due to subsequent Minoan interference with the earlier deposits. At all events, it would be rash to base too much on the absence of remains of a particular phase in one small area when dealing with such a large site. Further small soundings on the limits of the site might help to answer such questions. Note. The deposit was dug by natural levels which were numbered separately in each square and trench. Later, when the material was studied, it was found possible to combine these into the ten strata under which the material is grouped in this report.

A description of the architectural remains and other features found in the stratum comes first, followed by a cata- logue of the objects found in that stratum. A general discussion of the pottery and the various classes of small objects is left until the end. STRATUM X (FIGs. 7 and 8; PLATES 29 and 30, 1-3) Area AC. This stratum consisted of a relatively thin deposit of habitation debris which lay immediately above bedrock in Area Ac. The average depth was about 20 cm., but it attained a maximum thickness of about 40 cm. in places. The deposit consisted chiefly of dark earth with frequent traces of the action of fire and plentiful evidence of intense human activity. There were several patches consisting of thin layers of ash, possibly deriving from hollows in which fires had been kindled, and the remains later raked out. One of these hollows appeared to have had a stone lining. Many other pits of various sizes were found which belonged to this level (as well as others which had been cut down from later levels and terminated below the level of bedrock). The largest of them, Pit A, had a diameter of about 1i20 m. Some of the pits contained only earth, red, yellow, or brown, but others also produced ash, pieces of charcoal, carbonized grains, and animal bones. Just to the east of the central part of AC a roughly oval patch of earth was found which con- tained a large quantity of carbonized grains (FIG. 7). The northern part of this lay outside the area of the sounding, but its south-western edge was marked by a row of stake-holes. Four of these were identified which ran more or less in a straight line. Two of them contained ash, and a third had the carbonized remains of the end of a stake in it. The tree from which this stake was cut has been identified as oak, probably a deciduous rather than an evergreen species (see specialist report, p. 239). The remains of the stake also provided a C-I4 sample which, in the British Museum Radiocarbon Laboratory, gave a date of 6,Ioo1 i8o B.C. (B.M. 124). The grain found included naked hexaploid wheat, emmer, and barley.7 Seven skeletons of children were found in this level (FIG. 7). Six of these formed a group in the south-western part of the area. These, which were identified by the letters A-F, had evidently been deliberately laid in the deposit which constituted Stratum X before the next stratum had begun to accumulate, since there was no indication of pits dug down from above. The graves must, therefore, have been extremely shallow. The position of the body, when recognizable, was flexed, and there were no grave-goods of any kind. Two of the bodies, c and F, were laid on top of the filling of Pit A, and burial B overlapped it. Almost all the burials lay just below the east end 7 Kindly identified by Dr. H.

EVANS of House E in Stratum IX (PLATE 29, I) and they may well have been made just before the building of that structure. This might explain the excessive shallowness of the graves, in which the earth would appear to have only just covered the bodies. The details of the individual burials are as follows: A. New-born. Position not very clear, but probably flexed (FIG. 8 (A)). B. Six to seven years old. Flexed; knees together and legs drawn up to chin. Lying on left side (FIG. 8 (B) and PLATE 29, I). c.

Probably flexed (FIG. 8 (E) and PLATE 29, 3). F. New-born. Probably flexed (FIG. 8 (F)). The seventh burial, G, was more elaborate (PLATE 30, 1-3). It lay at a considerable distance from the rest at the foot of the eastern boundary of the area AC (FIG. 7). The body was that of a child probably about four or five years old and had been placed in a small oval pit cut into bed- rock. The pit was only 0o5 m. long, so the body was laid on its back in a flexed position. The limb- bones therefore lay above those of the trunk, and had to be removed before the backbone and ribs could be cleaned and photographed (PLATE 30, 2, 3). After the deposition of the body the simple grave was sealed with an oval stone (PLATE 30, I). As in the other cases, however, there were no grave goods. The lack of any traces of permanent structures in this stratum suggested that it may represent the remains of a temporary camp site set up by the first arrivals on the virgin hill-top. Because of the relatively small area examined, however, the idea is put forward with all reservations. Other parts of the site could easily modify this impression. Nevertheless, the signs of hasty improvisa- tion to meet quickly the most pressing needs of a community settling a new area are strong. Particularly impressive is the complete absence of pottery from this stratum, and the relative rarity of small finds.

At its deepest points this stratum was just over a metre thick, but in other parts it came to as little as 30 cm. The brightly coloured deposit consisted largely of the variegated debris of fired mud-brick. The colouring ranged from bright red and orange to dark brown, streaked here and there with the deep blacks of ash and charcoal. Stratum IX contained the earliest traces of solid structures found. The foundations of walls, made chiefly of fired mud-bricks, but with a variable amount of stones (often discarded querns or mortars) mixed in, survived up to a height of about 60 cm. The principal remains were those of part of a roughly square or rectangular room: the exact shape is uncertain as part of it remained unexcavated. This structure seemed to have had a rather complex history, for there was evidence that it had been several times rebuilt and remodelled. The earliest part of it was a wall which ran north and south right across AC, the southern part of which was later incor- porated in the east wall of the room (see FIGs. 7 and 9). In some places the lowest courses of this wall ran right down through Stratum X to bedrock (e.g. in the South Section, FIG. 4). However, the northern part of it lay above the earth containing the carbonized grain, which belonged to Stratum X. Thus the wall belongs as a whole to a later time, and where the bricks appear to run down into Stratum X they were probably being used to fill hollows or strengthen the footing of the wall in particularly weak spots in the rather soft deposit of the 'camp' stratum. The first building of the room (House E) may belong to a second phase when the wall just described had already become ruinous and partially collapsed. It was then used as the foundation for the outer face of the east wall of the room, which, like the west wall of the same, clearly had two faces, with a cavity between which was filled up with broken brick and stones. The north wall, on the other hand, was very flimsy, since it was apparently only one brick thick (FIG. 9). The largest stone component was in the east wall; in this stones and bricks were inextri- cably mixed. Both the east and north walls had a kind of foundation of stones bedded into the earth below the wall proper. The west wall had no such foundation and remarkably few stones were found in the wall itself. Near the north end of this wall was a narrow gap in the brickwork, c. 50 cm. wide, which seems to have been intentional, since the bricks made a regular end on either side and the space was floored with a single flat oval stone (a mortar). The gap may have been a narrow entrance, but it was perhaps not an original feature of the room, since the brick- work continued for a little way below the threshold. At a later stage it was certainly disused, since when found it had been deliberately filled up with old quernstones, &amp;c. (PLATE 30, 4). The room was certainly refloored at least once, though all traces of floors were at a relatively high level. One of these floors evidently belonged to the phase in which the doorway was in use, and had the peculiarity of being on two different levels. The western part, which connected with the threshold of the doorway, was a few centimetres higher than the rest, and there was a distinct step at the junction (PLATE 30, 4). Part of another brick structure belonging to this stratum was found in the south-east corner of the area. Here two pieces of walling, each one brick thick, formed a right angle, which may be the corner of another room, or just a boundary delimiting an area (its flimsiness might suggest this explanation). A peculiarity of the northern section of this wall was that all the bricks were laid as 'headers', whereas in the other structures they were all 'stretchers' (FIG. 7). The bricks used all appeared to have been fired quite hard, but they had taken on very different colours.

Of the super- structure of House E a little may be conjectured. The great amount of broken brick in Stratum IX leads one to suppose that most of the walls were of brick, though a large mass of whitish clay which was connected with the top of the surviving foundations of the east wall suggests that part may have been of pist, or that pisd may have been used for repairs (FIG. 4, South Section). Some pieces of daub with impressions of sticks suggest a roof of brushwood covered with sun- dried clay (PLATE 59, 1). The stratum contained the usual habitation debris outside the area of the house, but it was noticeable, as in the later remains of houses, that hardly anything was found on the floors of the house itself. Several ash-filled pits cut into the walls and floors of the house had been cut down from a higher level. Pottery and small finds were still relatively rare.

EVANS made up largely of the debris of broken and partially pulverized mud-bricks of various shades, mixed with habitation debris. The chief architectural feature was the mud floor and some traces of the walls of what must have been a rectangular structure in the western part of the area (FIG. Io and PLATE 31, 2). This structure, which was called House D, had in fact suffered so much that its exact character was difficult to infer. Traces of two walls were found, which ran roughly parallel to each other. One, in the extreme south-west corner, was of mud-brick, but apparently only one brick thick. I CMS FIG. 13. SECTIONS OF 'COMPLEX' HOLLOWS IN STRATUM V, (i) SOUTHERN HOLLOW; (ii) NORTHERN HOLLOW It is just conceivable that there might have been a second face to this wall outside the area of our sounding, and a cavity between, but this did not seem very likely. The parallel wall, which ran about 4 metres to the east of the one just described, was of an equivalent thickness (about 30 cm.). This wall was traceable for about 5 metres, but only the southernmost 2 metres survived to any appreciable extent. Even here it was only about 20 cm. high, and appeared to be made entirely of packed dark-brown mud, with no traces of any individual bricks visible. Over the rest of its length the lines of the edges of the wall could just be made out continuing in the same direction by differences in colour at the level of the floor of the house (PLATE 3 I, 2). Of the northern wall there was no trace; the floor ended in an irregular line on this side about 3-80 m. from the south edge of the sounding. The floor itself was of beaten earth and contained some features of considerable interest. Im- mediately above it, in the northern part of the room, was found an irregular heap of mud-brick debris, harder than the rest of the deposit. When this was cleared away two roughly rectangular areas were found beneath, each with an exceptionally hard, smooth, light-coloured floor, which was in each case bounded quite clearly by a hard raised rim (PLATE 3I, I). The largest of these areas was about I metre long and 60 cm. wide, and its long axis was orientated north-west to south-east, rather skew in relation to the walls of the room. The other lay a little to the south of the first, and was orientated roughly in the same direction, but was a little smaller and more oval in form. It seems possible that the brick debris piled over these two floors represents the ruins of a small mud-brick superstructure. In that case the most likely interpretation would be that these features are the remains of two small domed ovens. A little to the south of the second of the floors, also covered by the mud-brick debris, was a circular pit about I metre in diameter, which when cleared proved to be full of ash. Sealed as it was by the brick debris, there seems no doubt that this pit was contemporary with the use of the building, and probably connected in some way with the two brick ovens. On the east it seemed to encroach very slightly on the line of the east wall of the room, but not seriously.</page><page sequence="26">EXCAVATIONS IN THE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT OF KNOSSOS, 1957-60. PT. I 149 A little to the south, however, was a smaller, deeper pit, or perhaps post-hole, with a diameter of 20 cm., which cut right across the line of the east wall. There seems no doubt that this was cut from a higher level after the house went out of use. e. peg Knossos Palace Central Court PLAN of NEOLITHIC SITE s.. peg clay ring 0 -3.40m) heaps of stones &amp; ashes 'clay wall 3.12m. 3.21m. part of a clay ring clay from collaDsed wall s.peg 1 METRES 0 1 2 3 4 5 MENS.

PLAN OF FEATURES IN STRATUM IV Some fragments of daub with imprints of branches were also found in the remains of this stratum, indicating that the roofing of the structure was similar to that of the earlier house. In the east of the area were found some remains of a stone wall which ran north-south for a distance of I.60 m., but petered out almost entirely about 25 cm. from the southern boundary of the area. This piece of walling was unconnected with any other architectural remains. From the top of this stratum (i.e. the destruction level of House D) two large and deep pits had been opened in the south-east corner of the area (FIGs. I , 4, East Section, and PLATE 3 I, 3). The larger of these, Pit A, contained in its filling of ash and earth the two stone figurines, FIG. 63,</page><page sequence="27">I50 J. D.

II; PLATES 32-33) The composition of the deposit which constituted this stratum differed from that of any of the preceding ones, but was basically similar to that of all the later ones. This change was owing chiefly to a change in building technique. From Stratum VII on, the houses and other structures no longer contained any bricks, fired or unfired, though irregular lumps of lightly baked clay continued to be found from time to time. The standard construction for all walls was now packed mud (pise) set on a foundation of unworked stones and lumps of kouskouras (very soft limestone). The material used for the walls was light-coloured clay, varying in colour from creamy to deep yellow or khaki, and obtainable from the adjoining river bed, and probably</page><page sequence="28">EXCAVATIONS IN THE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT OF KNOSSOS, 1957-60. PT. I 151 from other places in the vicinity as well. No doubt it was more or less the same as the clay used in the making of pottery. When such constructions collapsed, or were levelled, the clay from their walls was spread over a considerable area, forming thick bands of a yellowish colour in the deposit, which alternated with darker levels representing the accumulation of occupation refuse during the life of the dwellings. The latter also included smaller streaks of lighter material FIG. I4A. DETAIL OF NORTH-WEST CORNER OF HOUSE IN STRATUM IV C, TRENCH XY, SHOWING STONE ENCLOSURE WITH POT (STRATUM IV, NO. I) which probably derived from material washed out of the walls during heavy rains and small local collapses of parts of walls. The stratum varied in thickness from a maximum of just under a metre in the south-west corner of Area Ac to about 40 cm. in the east of it. The greater part of AC was occupied at this stage by the remains of a house with at least two rectangular rooms, which lay side by side and were joined by a party wall which formed one of the long sides of both rooms (FIG. II and PLATE 32, 2). This house was built in the new technique, but only a single row of stones appeared to have been used to mark the line of the walls, which gave the surviving remains a very flimsy appearance. In the east room, however, where the outer long wall had retained some of its clay facing, it could be seen that it was originally considerably thicker than the surviving line of stones would have indicated (PLATE 32, I). The stones may therefore have been used only to indicate the line of the walls and to provide a core. The packed clay on the inside of this east wall had a smooth</page><page sequence="29">1. 2. 3.[ well --152m. --1.34m. 1.o6 -0 29m. p~t -2.l9m. 0 ashes Ipot. I. 644 1 METRES 0 1 2 3 4 5 MENS. J.

I 153 facing which joined the floor with a sharp angle at the base (PLATE 32, 3). In the north-east corner of this room a fire had evidently been lighted on the floor, which had burnt part of the floor itself and the adjoining wall-face to a bright pink colour, making it easier to distinguish at this point from the yellow clay of the collapsed walls which lay immediately above it. The floor of the western room was covered with a layer of ash. To the north, both rooms opened on to a cobbled area which surrounded a small circular depression, perhaps a cooking hole, which was half concealed by the northern boundary of the area (PLATE 32, I, 2). A special feature of the western room was a small area in the north- west corner, outlined by stones, in which the clay floor had been burnt to a brown colour, and on which lay some fragments of a large pot (PLATE 33, 3). It could have served as a hearth for cooking, or more probably simply as a 'cupboard' for storage. The clay floors of both rooms con- tained a number of small circular depressions in the smooth clay surface (PLATE 33, I, 2). In the initial clearing of the floors three of these were found in the east room, and two in the west. Those in the east room showed traces of the action of fire in and around them, and it was noticeable that one of them was overlapped by another, so that it must have been out of use and covered with fresh clay when the latter was made (PLATE 33, I). The holes were therefore not necessarily in use at the same time. When we began to remove the floor of House c a further considerable number of these holes was found, which had all been filled up and covered over with fresh clay after use. Below this floor a second clay floor was identified, which seemed to have preceded the erection of the present north wall of the east room, since it passed beneath it. This floor also contained a large number of the curious circular hollows, and like the one above it had evidently been partially renewed several times when these were covered with fresh clay. Almost all these hol- lows bore traces of fire. When the walls of House c were dismantled, several of the stones incorporated in the founda- tions turned out to be querns. A few pieces of impressed clay daub were found, as before. Outside the house to the south and west there were pebble pavements at the level of each of the floors just described, which formed a fairly continuous flooring. Two stretches of wall foundations of stone and clay, one running north-south and the other east-west, formed a T- shaped figure in the western part of the area (FIG. I I). They were part of a construction which must have been later than House c, since they rested on a thin layer of ash, which in turn rested on the higher of the two pebble pavements. Near the top of this stratum, in the destruction level of House c, the fragments of a smashed pot were found associated with the bones of a small animal (PLATE 33, 4). We seemed to be in the presence of a minor tragedy in the form of a lost meal! The pot was subsequently restored (see below, No. 3). STRATUM VII Area and No. level Complete and restored pots I.

STRATUM VI (PLATE 34, I, 2) Area AC. These levels contained no recognizable architectural remains, but there were many irregular patches of pebble paving and short stretches of larger stones in line, which prob- ably represented parts of destroyed walls, though no sense could be made of them in their present condition (PLATE 34, 2). The material which made up the stratum, which averaged about 50 cm. in thickness over most of the area, though increasing in depth to 1I20 m. in the south-east, was habitation refuse, mixed with much ash. In the south-east there was also a large amount of tumbled stone, which had probably fallen from a collapsed building to the south, and which accounts for the exceptional thickness of the stratum in this part. It is noteworthy that this building would have stood on the same site as the later buildings whose north walls show in the southern section in the later strata. In the south wall of the area there occurred at one point a broad lens of loosely packed stones with a good deal of yellow powdery material between them (FIG. 4, South Section). Among the minor features found in this level were two of the shallow circular hollows already noted as common in the floors of House c. In this case they were not associated with any structure, but they were surrounded by the usual traces of burning. One of them lay near the centre of the area, 1.5 m. south of the northern limit. Not far away to the north-east was found a curious rectangular patch of clay, fired to a rich brown colour and having a flat, carefully smoothed surface (PLATE 34, I). It was about 25 cm. long and 15 cm. wide, and seemed intended as a platform for resting something on. STRATUM VI Area and No. level Complete and restored pots I.

This stratum presented the same mixture of occupation refuse and material derived from the walls of clay structures as the preceding one. Its thickness of over a metre in the western half of the area was reduced to about 70 cm. in the east. Patches of flooring and scat- tered sections of wall foundations were identified at many points, but only in one level, towards the bottom of the stratum, were connected remains found. These structural remains lay to the west of the centre of Area AC. The most interesting com- plex consisted of traces of the bases of two walls, running roughly east to west with the remains of a smooth clay floor between. One of them, the northern, had vestiges of a stone core, the other appeared to be entirely of clay. The space between them was divided into three compartments by lines of smallish stones, one of which, I-70 m. long and 90 cm. wide, was closed to the west by a line of stones and to the south by what appeared to be a further clay wall (PLATE 34, 3). In the floor of this compartment was a shallow hollow, about 40 cm. in diameter, which was filled with earth which contained, near the top, part of an animal jawbone (PLATE 34, 4). From the south wall a similar line of stones ran to the southern limit of the area, where, just to the east of it, there was another small hollow, about 20 cm. in diameter; this one lay half beyond the boundary, and can be seen in the section of the south wall (FIG. 4). The smallness of the areas marked out by the rows of stones suggests that they may have been no more than kerbs. They could certainly not have been the bases of partitions of any height or substance, and there was no trace at floor level of the clay of which such walls must have been mainly constructed. To the north-west of the remains just described was found the end of a rectangular room, con- sisting of the foundations of walls of stone and clay (PLATE 35, I). Within were numbers of fallen stones, probably derived from the collapse of the upper parts of the walls, but no convincing floor could be found. Another wall touched the south-east corner of this structure and ran westwards at a slight angle to it. These walls seemed to belong to a slightly lower level than the complex of small compartments which lay to the south.</page><page sequence="35">158 J. D.

One of these ran north-south just to the west of the complex of small compartments, but apparently had no real connexion with it; the other, composed of larger stones, was just visible in a short stretch running across the corner formed by the western and southern boundaries of Area AC. A little to the east of the small compartments a series of hollows, made in floor-levels appar- ently unconnected with any surviving walls, came to light. Two of these were of a peculiar form and occurred in the same floor level, a little over 2 metres apart. In both the main hollow, which was about 25 cm. in diameter and 6 to 8 cm. deep, had a smaller hollow in the centre which had a diameter of about 8 cm. and a depth of about 4 cm.

The hollows had been carefully formed and finished, the clay surface having been carefully smoothed and having a slightly greasy appearance. The northernmost, which was the most perfectly formed, was removed entire in a plaster casing and sent to the Iraklion Museum.

STRATUM IV (FIGS. 14, 14A, and 15 and PLATES 35, 4, 5; 36; and 37, 1-3) The stratum corresponds to the whole of the period when pottery of E.N. II type was in use. Area AC. In this area Stratum IV was a thick deposit varying in depth from I to I -5 m., made up of many thin levels of occupation refuse which sloped downhill from west to east, but with scarcely any structural remains. Those which were found were of a very minor kind and there was no indication that anything on the scale of a house had existed here during this phase. There were, however, many other signs of activity in the form of hearths, traces of small clay struc- tures, patches of pebble pavement, shallow pits, many animal bones, and much broken pottery. Almost at the bottom of the stratum, a short section of wall was found running diagonally across the south-west corner of AC, part of a building which lay outside the excavated area. Above the level of the wall just described there was a floor level which was marked on the eastern extremity of the area by a semicircular platform (probably half of a fully circular one) of yellow clay, about 6o cm. in diameter (PLATE 35, 4), which projected from the section about half-way along it (FIG. 4, East Section). The function of this feature is by no means obvious; it could be a kind of built hearth, a somewhat differently constructed version of the one which occurred in the level above and which is described in the next paragraph, though the clay itself shows no signs of burning. Resting on it was a mass of material which included irregular lumps of clay fired to a brown colour, resembling fragments of bricks; and stones, some of which rested on pieces of reddish clay. These were all separated from the surface of the ring itself by a very thin layer of soil. When dismantled the ring itself showed signs of having been mended or added to several times. A lump of brown fired clay similar to the ones mentioned above was also found in the western part of Ac in this stratum. Near the clay disk were three separate heaps of stones arranged in a line running north to south about a metre from the east wall of the sound- ing. Each of these covered a mass of ash, bones, &amp;c. The northern one can be seen in PLATE 36, I. About 20-25 cm. above the level of the features just described lay some more scattered re- mains. In the northern half of the area, just east of centre, a small circular ridge of clay was found adjoining a patch of pebble paving. It had a diameter of about I'25 m. and contained at one point two stones set firmly in the clay. Inside the ring were burnt earth and a loose stone altered by the action of fire, so that the feature may have been a built hearth. Some ridges of clay running north-south about 80 cm. apart near this ring may have been connected with it in some way. Between them was a deposit containing ash and much broken pottery and animal bones. In the eastern part of the area a thin clay wall, about 25 cm. wide, was found running north and south somewhat over a metre from the eastern limit of the area. At the south it ran beneath the southern boundary of Ac, but on the north it turned east at right angles about a metre from the northern limit and disappeared under the eastern boundary. It cannot have been the wall of a house, but was probably simply a low wall built to enclose an area. Inside there was no real floor, but in the northern half a layer of rather soft yellow clay and</page><page sequence="42">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 18 19 17 16 15 14 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 37 36 35 34 33 32 FIG. 23.

EVANS soil occurred at the level of the bottom of the wall, which gradually petered out towards the centre of the exposed portion of the enclosure. Above this level there was a mass of ash, charcoal, and burnt soil and fallen stones. Fallen stone was also found outside the wall, so there may have been stones in the superstructure (FIG. 14 and PLATE 36, I). In the level above these (the wall and upper clay ring or hearth) a wall of stones ran across the north-central part of AC taking an east-north-east direction and finally disappearing under the northern limit of the area 2-5 m. from the eastern end. The other end stopped abruptly 3'75 m. from the western limit. It was parallel with the walls of the house-remains in Stratum III above, but there were no traces of any other walls connected with it. From the western end a few smaller stones in line ran south for about a metre and then broke off. A great many loose stones were found in the western half of the area in the same level, together with some irregular patches of pebble paving and ash. In the extreme east there were also several areas of ash with scattered stones, amongst which were found a quantity of animal bones. These were the latest remains in Stratum IV. Sounding XT. In this narrow trench were found no fewer than three building levels belonging to the period covered by the use of pottery of E.N. II type. Naturally, not much of each building was uncovered in this narrow trench, but enough to show that the area was occupied successively by three buildings with the same orientation. The remains of the earliest building were the most interesting. They stood on a floor only a few centimetres above bedrock, and comprised the clay and stone foundations of a room 3 metres wide (FIG. 15, 3 and PLATE 35, 5). The western and northern walls were fairly massive and seemed to be the external walls of the room. The one on the south side, however, appeared to be only a partition between rooms, both because it was not quite so thick as the others, and because the western wall continued beyond the junction. The smooth clay facing of the walls was well preserved in the north-west corner, and also on the outer face of the north wall, and there were traces of it remaining elsewhere also. The floor was also of smooth, hard clay, as usual. In the north-west corner a small square enclosure was formed by two flattish slabs of stone (both of which had previously had one surface hollowed through serving as querns or mortars). Within this stood the remains of a large pot (FIG. I4A). Two more stones partially enclosed the space to the south of this, which was found filled with grey ashy material and contained also a small pot. The south-west corner of the room also contained the broken remains of a fairly large pot. Just outside the north wall of the building the ground was found to be littered with an assortment of bones, stone rubbers, and potsherds which may either have been refuse thrown out from this house or from one of its neighbours, or the result of activities carried out in the spaces between houses (PLATE 36, 2). As usual, the floor of the room, in so far as it was revealed, proved to be very clean, and little material was recovered from it. When the walls of this structure were dismantled it could be seen that the north wall was more massively built, con- taining more and larger stones and less clay, than the north-south one. The latter was found to have one quernstone built into it, while another was found to the west of it among material possibly fallen from the upper courses. Above this building level, which here constituted Stratum IV C, was a second, IV B, in which building remains were represented only by a short stretch of wall (Wall c) running more or less on the line of the north-south wall of the earlier building in the southern half of the trench (FIG. 15, 2 and PLATE 37, 2). It consisted of smallish stones set in a mass of clay, with one or two considerably larger stones as a foundation at the bottom. The levels around this wall seemed to consist of collapse from it mixed with habitation debris, but no very well defined floor level was observed.</page><page sequence="44">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 FIG. 24.

EVANS The third building level, IV A, consisted of two walls, of which the larger, wall A, ran above wall c and roughly on the same line. The wall consisted of two rows of fairly large, mostly flat- tish, stones, with traces of clay (FIG. 15, I and PLATE 37, I, upper half). At the level of the lowest course there was a hard whitish clay floor to the south-west, presumably the floor of the room which was bounded by this wall. Above it was a thin level containing blackish material, pre- sumably the remains of occupation on the floor. To the south this floor had been cut through by a later well, which had also in all probability carried away the part of the south wall of the room, which would have passed through xY. To the north of wall A was a tumble of rubble, and also wall B, which was curved, and consisted of fairly large stones as a foundation, surmounted by a mass of smaller stones (PLATE 37, I, lower half). Its foundations were in the same level as those of Wall A, but it must have been built after wall A was in existence, since it butted up against the north end of it, but was not joined to it. It might well have been a wall enclosing a yard attached to the house, such as we found traces of in the Central Court sounding. The lowest courses of walls A and B were in levels which were still producing only E.N. II pottery, but the structure represented by wall A seems to have continued in use for some time, during which the floor level around it rose considerably. At the level of the third course from the bottom there was a pebble pavement to the east of it (PLATE 37, 3). On the west side of the wall there was a mass of yellowish clay, probably fallen from the wall. It is possible that the bottom of this may have been the inside floor of the room bounded by A, and corresponded to the pebble floor outside, though no clear floor level was identifiable. Above the level of the pebble floor on both sides of the wall the pottery was mixed E.N. II and M.N. STRATUM IV Area and No. level Complete and restored pots I.

STRATUM III (FIGS. 16-20 and PLATES 37, 4, 5; 38; 39; and 40, I, 2, 4) This stratum was exposed in Areas BD and F as well as Ac and traces of it were found also in xY. It is coextensive with the use of pottery of Middle Neolithic type and, in the upper part, with the beginning of the Late Neolithic style. A variety of architectural remains was found, chiefly in Areas BD and F, and two building levels were clearly discernible, which are indicated as III A and III B. Area AC. In this part of the sounding the stratum consisted chiefly of occupation refuse and the debris of the walls of buildings which lay to the north or south of it. There were no connected remains and only one or two portions of walls, which appeared to form parts of buildings which lay mainly outside the area. Nevertheless, the deposit was thick, attaining 1-5 m. in parts in the east, though down to as little as 50 cm. in the extreme west. Despite the poverty of actual structures, the deposits belonging to the two building levels could be fairly well distinguished. The lower level, B, was represented in the western part of the area by remains probably connected with House A in Area BD. A small wall of stones and clay emerged from the northern section, about 2-5 m. from its eastern end, and ran for about 6 metres in a direction roughly parallel to the southern wall of House A, and then turned southwards at a right angle, but broke off abruptly after about a metre (FIG. 2). No distinct floor level was associated with this wall, but below its eastern end there was a patch of pebbles, with many meat bones between the stones, on the south side (PLATE 37, 4), and further to the south-east several patches of ash with loose stones. Pebble pavements are normally found in the spaces between houses, so that this one was probably not part of a house floor. The wall foundations were not at all massive, and are more likely to have been part of an enclosure of some kind than of a house, despite the right angle.</page><page sequence="50">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 20 21 18 19 23 22 26 25 24" FIG. 27.

EVANS Above the remains of the wall just described, and covering most of the western part of Ac and almost the whole of the eastern half, was a thick layer of yellow clay from the walls of House A in BD. This was naturally thickest in the northern part and became gradually thinner towards the west and south until it petered out altogether. As usual, this yellow level, sealing in the occupa- tion refuse below, was almost completely sterile. In the upper surface of the clay mound thus formed over the ruins of House A was a striking feature; a shallow circular pit about 40 cm. in diameter, filled with pottery jars and other vases, crushed by the pressure of earth above, but complete (PLATE 39, 2). It lay near the top of the mound, near the northern limit of Ac and a little east of centre (FIG. 20). A similar pit was found in the corresponding level in BD (see below, p. 176). To the south-east, near the edge of the clay mound, was another shallow pit (diameter 30 cm.) containing ash and a few stones altered by fire (FIG. 20). The same building level is represented in the extreme south of AC by the remains of two courses of a wall which emerged from the southern limit of the area at about 4-80 m. from the east end, ran for about 2"50 m. parallel to the III B wall on the north side, and then made a return at right angles and disappeared once more beyond the limits of the area (FIG. 4, South Section; PLATE 37, 5, bottom). There were few architectural traces of III A in area AC. In the extreme north-west there was a thin yellow level which appeared to be material washed out from the walls of House B in BD. In the extreme south-east were the massive remains, standing fully 8o cm. high, of the corner of a stone structure lying to the south (later investigated further in Area F (FIG. 4, South Section). This structure was built above the remains of the wall described in the last paragraph, and lay mostly to the east of it, though the walls appeared to be similarly orientated. Clay washed out from this wall could be seen to lie just above the southern extremity of the walls of House A (Area BD). Area BD. Remains of the fairly well preserved foundations of two structures were found in this area: House A, which lay chiefly in the original Square D itself; and House B, which lay within Square B (FIG. 17). It was necessary to extend the whole area 2 metres northward in order to reveal House A completely. House A was found to belong to III B and House B to III A. House A displayed many features of interest. It consisted of a roughly square room of about 4 metres (PLATE 38, I). The foundations of the walls, which rose nearly a metre high in places, were composed, as usual, of rough stones and lumps of soft kouskouras (decayed soft limestone) mixed with some clay. In the middle of the south wall the wall foundation projected a little into the room over a length of about a metre, forming a kind of internal buttress (PLATE 38, 2). The entrance to the room appeared to be in the north-west corner, but unfortunately the walls were not well preserved in this part, and the situation was not as clear as could have been wished. Certainly the northern wall came to an end about a metre from the point where it would have joined the western one, while the latter apparently ran on northwards past this point. The feature im- mediately recalls the plan of the famous house found by Dawkins at Magasa, but unfortunately we were not able to check whether the west wall made a return parallel to the north one. Internally also the room was full of interest. The walls appeared to have been covered with a smooth clay plaster, which survived at several points, particularly round the buttress. The wall plaster met the smooth clay floor at right angles. In the south-east corner, between the east end of the buttress and the east wall, was a square platform, raised about 20 cm. above the floor level. It was bounded by a kerb of stones which were probably originally also covered with clay plaster (PLATE 38, 2). Roughly in the centre of the room was a hollow for fire (FIGS. 16 and S17). To the east of it, almost parallel with the beginning of the platform, was an irregular black stain which seemed to be the trace left by ash presumably raked out of the hollow (PLATE 38, 2).</page><page sequence="52">1 2 3 4 8 12 16 20 5 6 7 10 11 14 18 15 19 9 13 17 S21 22 24 S25 23 26 27 28 29 FIG. 28.

EVANS At the north corner of the east wall was a small square recess formed by the north wall and a projection of the east wall similar to the buttress already described, but smaller. This was closed on the open west side by two small flat stones set on edge, and within were the remains of a large storage jar (PLATE 39, I). A similar 'cupboard' existed on the north wall, but this time it was formed entirely with pieces of stone and slate and projected from the wall. This also con- tained some sherds of a pot. Immediately behind this second 'cupboard' the wall foundations were capped with a smooth layer of clay in which were found two cylindrical post-holes (PLATE 39, 4). The function of these features was not at all clear. Such posts might have been intended to strengthen the stone and pisd structure of the wall, or could just conceivably have been in- tended to support the architrave of a window. Inside the room the yellow clay of the collapsed walls lay directly on the clay floor. There was very little trace of occupation refuse and very few finds, apart from the two pots mentioned. The floor had evidently been kept clean until the moment of the destruction of the house. Outside, however, there were thick deposits of dark occupation debris above the contemporary floor. There was a second 'pottery pit' in BD cut into the clay from the collapsed walls of the house. It lay in the south-west part of the original Square D, and was filled with pots of different kinds crushed in situ (FIG. 20 and PLATE 39, 3)- These, like the ones in the other pit, were all of Middle Neolithic type. House B (FIGs. 5, West Section, and 17) belonged to Stratum III A. It lay at about the same depth as House A, but it belonged to a later phase. The footing of a wall which ran eastward from one corner of it appeared to lie above the level of the remains of the west wall of House A (PLATE 40, I) though little remained of either at this point, and its south-west corner had been built in a hollow artificially cut through levels of occupation debris associated with House A (see section, FIG. 5). The few sherds of pottery found on the floor of House B con- firmed this picture, since they proved to belong to a transitional phase from Middle to Late Neolithic. The most important remains of House B which were within our area belonged to part of a small trapezoidal room (width at floor level less than 2 metres) whose long axis ran from north- east to south-west. The corner of what was probably another room of the house was found adjoining this to the north (PLATE 40, 2). The wall running off to the east, already mentioned, may have been part of another room, or possibly only part of a stone 'fence' enclosing an area adjoining the house. It was thinner than the other walls and contained only small stones. The walls of the main room survived to a height of nearly a metre in parts and were quite solidly built of stones and clay. In the south-west wall a brick-like lump of terracotta was found at one point. It was, however, very difficult to distinguish the actual face of the walls from the large amount of tumbled stone and clay which surrounded them inside and out. No plaster facing survived to help with this (if one ever existed). A shelf or bench, its upper surface cobbled with stones, ran along the inside face of the north wall (PLATE 40, I). It stood about 30 cm. above the height of the rest of the floor. A thin dark level of occupation refuse covered the clay floor in this room, and this yielded the small number of sherds which made clear the date of the building in terms of the pottery sequence. A patch of pebble paving which adjoins the outer side of the north-east wall at a somewhat higher level than the floor on the inside was probably con- temporary, or almost contemporary, with the occupation of the house, to judge by the pottery from this level (FIG. 19 and PLATE 40, 4). Some of the levels of occupation debris which were contemporary with House A ran below the walls and floor of House B. Area F. This area was dug with the express purpose of finding out more about the building in Stratum III A known from the section of wall which projected from the southern limit of AC. This wall was eventually traced for a length of 8 metres and no return was found. It was</page><page sequence="54">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 16 15 14 17 18 FIG. 29. E.N.

EVANS evidently the outer wall of an extensive building, since smaller walls were found leading off at intervals and forming rooms and corridors to the south (FIG. 18). The 'corner' visible in the part showing in Ac proved to be simply a small buttress, and a corre- sponding small projection on the south side formed part of a doorway between two rooms, or a room and a corridor. No floor could be traced in this corridor, but to the south of it part of another room was uncovered which had an easily identifiable floor. In the area to the east of this room and the doorway there were several pits and some fragments of pebble paving, which suggested that this may have been an open courtyard rather than a room. The corner of a wall which bounded this area to the south-east was found where it joined the main east-west wall, and on the south face of it was found a small 'cupboard' made of slabs of stone on end, which were found to be discarded querns or mortars.

STRATUM II (FIG. 20 and PLATE 40, 3) This was a relatively thick level, attaining a maximum thickness of about I metre in BD and I 3 metres in AC, but there were few and relatively unimportant architectural remains surviving within the area excavated. There were, however, many irregular patches of pebble paving and much evidence of intense human activity. The pottery represents a transitional phase from Middle to Late Neolithic. Area AC. The only real architectural remains were two short stretches of wall forming a right angle in the north-east sector of Square A. One of these ran in under the northern limit of the area, and was continued by two short stretches of wall in B (FIG. 20). A scatter of stones running north-eastward from this corner was interpreted as a wall, but may have been only tumbled stones. Traces of a wall were also visible towards the eastern end of the south section at this level. Area BD. In this area also remains attributable to Stratum II were scanty. There were first the two short stretches of wall already mentioned which continued in Square B the line of the south-north wall already mentioned in Square A. The only other remains attributable to this stratum were in the eastern half of the area (Square D). Two walls of a rectangular room (probable long axis running north-west to south-east) were found apparently built on ground which sloped away sharply towards the north-east (FIG. 20 and PLATE 40, 3).

EVANS surface here was determined, or at least accentuated, by the mound of clay covering the remains of House A, and it was upon this that the later house had been built. The eastern and perhaps part of the southern walls must have collapsed down the hill; at any rate there was no trace of the former. A mass of sherds was found in a heap just to the west of this structure, but they did not make up into complete pots. Area F. No connected remains were found of this period, though there was much fallen debris mixed with Late Neolithic pottery and embedded in a deposit containing much yellow clay. The level of yellow clay which surrounded the structures of this phase in Ac and BD rose relatively steeply, as though the whole of this part of the settlement had been on a steep slope, and outcropped on the surface in the western part of the sounding. It was quite clear that, as had always been supposed, the top of the hill had been levelled at the time of the building of the Palace, which resulted in the removal of those portions of the latest levels which lay near the centre. This yellow level was traced by means of a trench cut southward from Area AC to link up with the remains of Sir Arthur Evans's 1923 houses, and it was found to pass quite clearly below these, which therefore belong to our Stratum I.

STRATUM I (FIG. 21) This comprises the latest Neolithic levels in the eastern part of the main sounding, AC, BD, and above this, in parts, loose earth put in to make up and level the western part of the Central Court, and so containing much Minoan pottery as well as Neolithic. Area AC. No architectural remains, only patches of pebble paving. Area BD. In the north-east corner of the area a wall emerged from the northern limit and ran south-east for just over 2 metres. At the northern end of its eastern face a little clay facing still adhered to it. Beyond the wall, between it and the eastern limit of the area, the space was filled with stones collapsed from the wall. Above this level was a short stretch (I'5 metres) of wall which ran from west to east, its eastern end lying over the wall just described. Above this again were some patches of pebble paving representing the latest Neolithic remains in this area. Area E. In this area the houses excavated by Evans in I923 were cleared of soil. The re- mains were much decayed and it was difficult to identify the various rooms very precisely. However, their stratigraphical position above the clay of Stratum II was quite clear, as noted above.</page><page sequence="66">1 2 3 4 5 6 10 15 20 24 27 29 9 13 14 19 23 7 8 11 12 16 17 18 21 22 25 26 28 FIG. 35.

It proved impossible to keep all the pottery found for lack of storage space, so that some of the featureless sherds had eventually to be thrown away. All sherds from Square c, and later from the whole Area Ac, after A and c had been joined, were preserved, including all the featureless body-sherds, but from the other areas only rims, bases, handles, and sherds with decoration or some other distinctive feature were kept.</page><page sequence="70">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10- 11, 20 12 13 14 15' 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 30 31 29 32 33 34 35 36 37 39 40 38 41 42 43 44 45 46 46 47 48 FIG. 37.

EVANS The pottery from Squares A and c, which were eventually joined together as Area AC, was selected for especially thorough analysis, since this area produced a complete sequence of all periods. The sherd-counts and diagrams which illustrate the following account are based on this work. Area AC yielded in all about 21/2 tons (2,5oo00 kg.) of pottery, but the distribution of this through the various strata was notably unequal. The diagram (FIG. 44) shows this quite clearly. The most striking feature is perhaps the complete absence of pottery from Stratum X, but scarcely less striking is the smallness of the amounts found in Stratum IX and Stratum VIII. After this the quantities found became rapidly much greater. The peak reached in Stratum IV and the rapid fall away from this in the later levels are perhaps a little misleading. It has to be remembered that Stratum IV in Area AC was an excep- tionally thick deposit of habitation refuse, with scarcely any trace of architectural remains, and that the evidence of sounding xY shows that it represents a long period of occupation on the site, during which there were at least three building levels. Conversely, much of Stratum I, and some of Stratum II, was removed in this area when the Central Court was constructed in Middle Minoan times. The material from the present excavations has confirmed to a remarkable degree the results set out by Dr. Audrey Furness (Mrs. Ozanne) in her careful study of the material from Evans's test-pits which was published eleven years ago.8 Evans's system of keeping the pottery together by metres from the surface evidently answered quite well on this site. This is quite understand- able, taking into account the nature of the deposit, the unbroken cultural tradition of the settlement, and the relatively slow rate of change. Nevertheless, limitations were necessarily imposed by this somewhat coarse screen, and it is now possible to follow the development of the Knossos Neolithic pottery in greater detail than hitherto. In general it was obvious that the material fell clearly into the four stylistic periods, Early Neolithic I and II, Middle Neolithic, and Late Neolithic, which were distinguished by Furness, and it was not possible to make any further absolute subdivisions of comparable importance. Of the four periods, E.N. I, which occupies a greater depth of deposit than all the others put together, would seem to be the most likely to subdivide. In fact it is extraordinarily homo- geneous, and the striking variations in the frequency of certain traits from stratum to stratum only serve to emphasize the overall similarity of the material throughout the whole phase. The fabric of the Neolithic pottery of Knossos was described in detail by Furness in her article, and there is little to add to this from visual inspection. A technical examination of samples of the material from various levels is being carried out for me by Dr. S. Scholes, of the Refractories Section of the British Iron and Steel Research Association's Laboratory, and will be published. Even the early pots were quite competently made and adequately fired, though a good many examples of E.N. I fabrics are rather more brittle than later pottery. The gradual abandon- ment of the practice of burnishing coarse wares which took place during the period of the settlement's existence may, as Furness suggested, have been in some way connected with an overall improvement in firing which made it unnecessary to provide storage pots with a 'mech- anical slip' to make them non-porous. However, it is noteworthy that our excavations showed that coarse sherds whose surface was simply smoothed, or finished with a little perfunctory and perhaps purely decorative 'scribble burnish', were relatively common down to the lowest levels in which a reasonable quantity of pottery was found. The bulk of the material was, like that found by Evans, very fragmentary, especially near the top of the deposit. Complete or reconstructible pots were rarely found, and joins or large 8 Furness, op. cit., n. 3 above.</page><page sequence="72">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 18 20 24 28 21 25 29 22 26 23 27 31 30 FIG. 38.

Complete or relatively complete pots, like those found in the two 'pottery pits' in Stratum III, or the two deep pits in Stratum VIII, were therefore all the more important and welcome, but it remained difficult to build up a complete series of the full range of profiles in use at any one time. An interesting general point made by Furness was that the shapes of large coarse pots were at all times more suitable for storage than for cooking. Certainly we do not often find marks of fire on pottery at Knossos, and we might perhaps be tempted to relate this to the relative abundance of possible 'cooking holes' found in the course of the excavation. In the account which follows of the material of each period I have used the categories estab- lished by Furness for the main shapes, which are relatively few and tend to merge into each other, so that distinctions are inevitably somewhat arbitrary at times. I have concentrated on the points on which new information is provided by the present excavations, and avoided, as far as possible, repetition of already well-known facts. EARLY NEOLITHIC I Pottery first appeared in Area AC in Stratum IX, and in very small quantity, but the amounts found continued to increase in each successive stratum throughout the period (see diagram, FIG. 44). Even at its first appearance, however, the pottery bears all the marks of being the product of a fully developed tradition of potting. Instead of the very simple vessels which mark the beginning of pottery at Qatal Htiytik in Anatolia and at such sites as Gremnos and Nessonis in Thessaly, we find wares with a variety of shapes and a number of special features, such as pointilli and incised decoration, beaded rims, flap and wishbone handles, and trumpet lugs, some of the latter already of a vestigial character. It therefore seems unlikely that we are dealing here with early experiments in pot-making, despite the early dates suggested by the C-14 samples. The coarser wares show a considerable variety of colouring, ranging from red through brown and buff to grey and black. The peculiarity noted by Furness of pots whose interior is lighter or darker than the exterior was frequently observed. The coarse wares are mostly burnished, though, as mentioned in the introduction, smoothed or scribble-burnished pieces are never completely absent, and are, in fact, often present in considerable numbers. The rims of coarse pots were normally rounded or tapered, though a few flattened rims, a feature which became much more popular later, are also found. There is no hard-and-fast line to be drawn between fine and coarse wares at this stage, but the latter are always burnished, and are predominantly black in colour, though brown and clear red pieces are always present, at least in small numbers. Stratum VIII produced a few examples of black-topped ware, both coarse and fine, bur- nished and unburnished. FIG. 39, I, and PLATE 41, no. 5, show a bowl in coarse burnished ware, and FIG. 39, 5, and PLATE 4I, no. 6, an example of part of a bowl with offset rim in fine ware, both of which have this peculiarity. The only two rainbow sherds found in the whole ex- cavation came from the same stratum, and may well be the result of an accident in firing rather than of deliberate intention. SHAPES Types I and 2. Open bowls with rounded profile (FIG. 22, I and 2, FIG. 23, I-4) or with straight or splayed profile (FIG. 22, 3-4, FIG. 23, 9-10) These are both very common throughout this period, but Type I occurs about four times as frequently as Type 2. The two types are about equally common in coarse and fine ware. In</page><page sequence="74">(I) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) FIG. 39.

EVANS addition to the vertical strap and ribbon handles, and perforated or unperforated lugs on or below the rim, which were noted by Furness as the usual types of handle found on them, some carry pairs of perforated or unperforated triangular 'ears' rising above the rim (FIG. 26, I, 2, 4-6). When complete, these pots would probably have had two pairs of these 'ears' set opposite each other. The frequency of occurrence per Ioo kg. of pottery found was 325 for Type i, as against 86 for Type 2. All probably had flat bases, like FIG. 40, I and 7. Type I A. Open bowls with beaded or slightly ofset rims (FIG. 22, 6; FIG. 23, 7) Bowls of this type occur in small quantities throughout E.N. I. The numbers rose steadily to a maximum of twenty-one per Ioo kg. of pottery in Stratum V. Type 3. Carinated bowls. (A) Simple (FIG. 23, 20 and 2 I) (B) Profiled (FIG. 22 , 8 and 9) These are not very common in E.N. I and the unprofiled variety is rarer than the profiled until Stratum V, when the situation is temporarily reversed (FIG. 47). Some of the larger examples of the shape could be classed as coarse ware because of their size and thickness, but in later periods both varieties of this shape are found only in fine ware.

Bowls with ofset rim (FIG. 22, 10 and I I; FIG. 23, 23-29) This type is exceptionally common during the E.N. period (FIG. 47). A number of examples are classifiable as coarse, but by far the greater number are in fine ware. The proportion is about six of fine to one of coarse. The overall frequency per Ioo kg. is 286. Type 4A. Carinated bowls with ofset rim (FIG. 23, 32-34; PLATE 47, I, no. 5) This is a variant of Type 4 with a sharp carination. It is much rarer, but its interest is that it seems to enjoy a sudden phase of temporary popularity in Stratum V, at the end of the E.N. I period (FIG. 47). It is found only in fine ware. Type 5. Bowls with incurved rim (FIG. 22, 12; FIG. 24, I) A rare type, but it nevertheless occurs throughout E.N. I in both coarse and fine ware. A fine example with two vestigial trumpet lugs came from Pit A in Stratum VIII (FIG. 39, 2; PLATE 41, 3). Types 6 and 7. Deep bowls or jars with mouths narrower than the widest diameter (FIG. 23, 5 and 6) and narrow-necked jars (FIG. 22, 5; FIG. 23, I2) Both these types occurred persistently in all the E.N. I strata, and were found in both coarse and fine ware, though such closed shapes were always much rarer than the open ones like Types I and 2. The average frequency of occurrence per Ioo kg. of pottery throughout the period was 40 and 45 respectively. Type 8. Funnel-necked jars (FIG. 22, 18, 19; FIG. 24, I1, I4, 15) These occurred in all strata of E.N. I, though with a relatively low frequency, which averaged about 9 per Ioo kg. of pottery.

Many of the pieces have a small lug or handle on the rim, but the incomplete state of all the finds makes it impossible to say whether there was only one on each vessel.

The effect was most marked in some of the ribbon handles of relatively fine ware (though, as Furness also noted, these handles are never found on the finest ware).

The simple wishbone handle and the type with a small knob at the end are already present in small numbers in the earliest strata, but the numbers increase rapidly towards the end of the period, reaching a peak in Stratum V (FIG. 25, 18-22; PLATES 45, 3, nos. 1-3, 6, and 46, I, no.

FREQUENCY OF CERTAIN SHAPES (per 0oo kg. of pottery). (Types 4, 3B, 4A, 3A) A more developed type of wishbone handle with a short prong in place of the knob, and a U-shaped rather than V-shaped lower half (FIG. 25, 23) began to appear occasionally as early as Stratum VI, but reached its greatest popularity only later, in E.N. II. A type with a longer prong was perhaps also introduced in E.N. I, for it makes a single appearance in Stratum VI, but it seems really to belong rather to E.N. II and especially M.N., during which it enjoyed a limited popularity. The simple and knobbed varieties of wishbone handle were almost certainly used on bowls, and were, like the flap handles, attached to the rim, probably in pairs. They could also have been used singly on ladles, of which fragments occur. The pronged handles, on the other hand,</page><page sequence="84">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 FIG. 48.

The first is the normal trumpet lug with expanded ends and a horizontal perforation (PLATE 45, I, nos. 3, 4, 6). This is rare. The second is a solid version of the first, without perforation (FIG. 25, 6, 7). It occurs considerably more frequently, especially in vestigial versions (represented by pairs of knobs or small plastic cordons, e.g. FIG. 39, 2). The third version is flattened, and has also no perforation. The perforation is indicated only by an incised line in the clay (FIG. 25, I I, 12). This type is again rare and last appears in Stratum VI. All trumpet lugs are found only on fine wares (FIG. 45).

No recon- structible vessel was found except the oval bowl (FIG. 39, 4, and PLATE 41, no. 2), but probably most were from circular pots of the normal types. Probably each vessel had two pairs of the 'ears' set opposite each other. They were found most often on fragments of open bowls of Type I, but they also occurred on sherds of flat-bottomed dishes or mugs (FIG. 26, 7). The type is con- fined to the E.N. period, and almost entirely to E.N. I, where it is especially frequent in the earlier strata (FIG. 45).

One was a trough-spout similar to the ordinary M.N. and L.N. ones, but of coarse ware. The other was a tubular one, and belonged to a bowl with offset rim (Type 4) (FIG. 28, 27). DECORATION The chief criterion used by Furness in defining E.N. I as a special period was the prevalence of plastic and pointilli decoration. Our excavations fully confirmed that they are both much more frequent than at any later time, and that it is possible to recognize a piece of E.N. I type pointilli or plastic decoration quite easily, even if found unstratified. Plastic decoration (FIG. 26, I2-24; PLATE 46, I, nos. 7 and 8; PLATE 46, 2) Though a little plastic decoration was in fact found in Stratum IV (E.N. II), the vast majority of sherds with varieties of this type of decoration belonged to the E.N. I strata. More- over, they were most frequent in the earlier strata of this period and became progressively less common later, and notably in Stratum V. Of the various types distinguished by Furness,"I the most common was the type with raised mouldings or plastic strips of clay, the ends of which usually projected slightly above the rim, producing a scalloped effect (FIG. 26, 19, 21 and 22; PLATE 46, 2, no. 7 and PLATE 47, I, no. I). Next came groups of large knobs, often apparently in threes or fours (FIG. 26, 13; PLATE 46, 2, nos. 2 and 3), though the sherds were often too small to give any idea of the total number in a group or of the arrangement. Rows of small pellets (FIG. 26, I4 and 17; PLATE 46, 2, nos. I and 6) and dentated rims (FIG. 26, 23; PLATE 46, I, no. 8) were much rarer. Plastic decoration seemed to occur most often on fragments of open bowls, and indifferently on the coarse and fine varieties. The sherd counts are given below: No. of occurrences Frequency per 0oo kg. ofpottery IX VIII VII VI V IX-VII VI V Mouldings . 6 18 42 67 19 33 22 4 Rows of pellets . o 2 I 7 6 i 2 1 Large knobs . o 4 33 39 12 x6 13 3 Dentated rims . o 3 2 2 3 2 o o In the diagram (FIG. 46) the first three categories have been combined and the last omitted. Pointillk decoration (FIG. 27; PLATE 46, 3, 4, nos. 4-9) Pointilli was by far the most popular form of incised decoration in E.N. I. The patterns were normally filled with white paste, and occasionally with red paste, to make the design stand out. The pieces decorated in this way were divided into those whose decoration was built up of triangles and strips (including zig-zags and step patterns) and those which had other arrange- ments. The former were the great majority, though there was a noticeable rise in the numbers of other patterns towards the end of the period.

It is sometimes found on the same sherd with pointilli patterns but it does also occur alone on sherds, though, of course, it is never possible to be sure that pointilli was not in fact used on some other part of the vase. It is found exclusively on the same range of fine wares as the pointilld.

A few fine pieces have bands left unburnished which were filled with an incised pattern (PLATE 46, 4, no. I). One small sherd had a strip which was left unburnished, evidently deliberately, and plain. Ripple burnish One small sherd with faint rippling was found in Stratum VIII, but it was an isolated in- stance in E.N. I. The sherd was part of a large, thick-walled bowl of Type 5. EARLY NEOLITHIC II The Early Neolithic II period is represented in Area AC by one thick stratum of deposit over a metre in depth. This accumulation of material, which is almost pure habitation refuse, and the immense quantity of sherds found suggest that it represents a relatively long period of time. This impression is confirmed by the three building levels which were associated with E.N. II pottery in sounding xY. In many respects the continuity with E.N. I is strong in this period, particularly in the range of shapes used. Some E.N. I features continue to flourish, others fall off. A certain number of innovations also appear in the course of the period. There is very little change in the fabric of the pottery. The coarse ware shows some improve- ment in firing, and variations of colouring on the same pot are no longer striking. The propor- tion of coarse wares which are simply smoothed or given only a little scribble burnish is greatly increased. Unburnished pieces are chiefly grey or buff in colour, burnished ones a richer black, brown, or red, through the tendency of burnishing to deepen the surface colouring. Some squared rims continue to be found among the coarse wares, and clubbed rims also begin to appear for the first time (FIG. 29, nos. 4-10, 14). Fine wares are as before. They are all finished by careful burnishing and the black ones greatly outnumber those with a red or brown surface. SHAPES Types I, IA, and 2 (FIG. 29, 1-5, I4; FIG. 30, I-I I; PLATE 48, 2, nos. 20-22) These continued to occur in this period with about the same frequency as before. The frequency of occurrence is 3o9, 19, and 105 per i 00 kg. of pottery respectively. Types 3A and3B (FIG. 30, 12-23; PLATE 47, 4, nos. 6, 7) Type 3A continued during this period to enjoy the rather modest popularity which had set in for it in Stratum V (FIG. 47), and 3B rose to a slightly higher frequency.

EVANS Type 4 (FIG. 30, 24, 25, 30-36; PLATE 48, 2, no. 13) The 1298 occurrences counted in this stratum represent a slight falling off in frequency of occurrence in comparison with Stratum V and Stratum VI (264 per Ioo kg. of pottery instead of 324 and 31o respectively) (FIG. 47). The proportion of fine to coarse examples is still about five to one. Type 4A (FIG. 30, 21, 26-29; PLATE 47, 3, no. 6, 4, nos. 1-3 and 8; PLATE 48, 2, nos. 4 and 15) This type reaches the peak of its popularity with 322 occurrences in Stratum IV, which represents a frequency of 46 per Ioo kg. of pottery (FIG. 47). Type 5 became rare, but Types 6-8 continued with little change (FIG. 30, 37-40, 45-48). The flat-based dishes and mugs almost died out, apart from a single occurrence, and the rectangular trays or lids disappeared completely, as also did the oval-eared bowls. There were, however, four fragments of pedestalled bowls, and also a number of pieces from the large 'legged re- ceptacles', which seemed to be particularly characteristic of this phase (FIG. 3 I, 3-5). HANDLES AND LUGS Simple tubular lugs, ring-handles, &amp;c. (FIG. 29, 13, 14, 6, I18; PLATE 47, I, nos. 4 and 6; PLATE 48, 2, nos. 18 and 19) These continue to be by far the most common types. Well over a thousand of all kinds were found. Among these a good many examples still displayed the flanged or saddle-shaped top to a marked degree. Flap and wishbone handles (FIG. 32, 1-6, 8-I ; PLATE 48, I, nos. 7 and 25, 2, nos. 16 and 17) There was a small revival in the use of simple pierced flap handles in this phase. Ten were found altogether in Stratum IV, or approximately one per Ioo kg. of pottery (FIG. 45). The 42 examples of simple wishbone and knobbed handles found represented a drop in fre- quency in comparison with the previous stratum from 17 to 6 per Ioo kg. of pottery (FIG. 45). On the other hand, there were 56 examples of the ordinary pronged type, which is a rise in frequency from 3 to 8 per Ioo kg. of pottery in comparison with the previous stratum, and there were no fewer than 10 examples of the long-pronged type (FIG. 45). Trumpet lugs (FIG. 31, 9, I I, 12) The flattened type of trumpet lug has died out, but four examples of the perforated type, and no fewer than 75 unperforated or vestigial ones were found, which gives an overall frequency of Io per Ioo kg. of pottery for these lugs. This renewed popularity was, however, the prelude to their final disappearance in M.N. SPECIAL FEATURES Internally thickened rims (FIG. 30, IO, I I) There were no less than twenty-nine occurrences of this feature on sherds of this phase, far more than before or after. Spouts There was one small, but coarsely made, tubular spout. DECORATION Plastic and pointillh decoration (FIG. 32, 12, 13, I5, I6, I7; PLATE 47, 3, no. 6; PLATE 48, I, nos. 5, 15, 17, 18, and 23; PLATE 49, 2) These still continued to occur, though much more rarely than in previous strata.

EVANS noticeable that they were considerably less frequent in the upper part of the deposit of this period than in the lower half, though they were not entirely absent even near the top. Of the various types of plastic decoration, there were 19 examples of mouldings (PLATE 49, 2), none of rows of pellets, i i of large knobs (PLATE 48, I, no. 5), and 3 of dentated rims. The overall frequency of plastic decoration per 00oo kg. of pottery was 4. 1 2 3 4 5 6 FIG. 53. TYPES OF QUERNS AND MORTARS (Not to scale) Pointilli decoration was represented by 7 examples of triangles and strips, and 14 of other patterns (overall frequency 3 per Ioo kg. of pottery). The evaluation of these figures is com- plicated by a change in style. For the first time other patterns outnumber the triangles and strips, and some of the latter include novelties such as masses of dots, unbordered by in- cised lines, and other arrangements which produce a different effect from any hitherto known (FIG. 32, 13, 17, and PLATE 48, I, no. I5). These herald a new type of pointilli decoration which continued to develop through the later strata, though it never became as popular as the E.N.I type was in its day. Other incised decoration (FIGo. 32, 14, 18-34; PLATE 47, 3, 4; PLATE 48, I, nos. 1-4, IO-I4, 16, 19-22, 26-31, and 33, and 2, nos. I-Io) Incised decoration has become vastly more popular on the fine wares than the pointilli ever was, even at its most popular. As already noted, this process had begun already in Stratum V, but the numbers of incised sherd s soar dramatically in Stratum IV. Furness's suggestion that</page><page sequence="94">EXCAVATIONS IN THE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT OF KNOSSOS, 1957-60. PT. I 217 incised decoration was probably as frequent in this period as it ever became later is shown to be correct by our figures. These suggest that it was even more popular then than later. The present excavations have also shown the possibility of isolating a distinctive E.N. II style in incised decoration, which was not really possible on the old material. The principal charac- teristics of this style are a greater variety of patterns than the later incised wares (most of them 1 2 3 4 FIG. 54. MICROLITHS (1) Trapeze, Str. VIII. (2) Notched lunate, Str.

(Scale 1) peculiar to it) and a marked carelessness and irregularity in the execution of them. This last feature contrasts strongly with the very regular and careful execution of the M.N. decoration. The incisions are always deep and were done before firing. The characteristic patterns are made up of a few simple basic elements. The chief of these are lines bordered by rows of short strokes, which are sometimes developed into small excised tri- angles (FIG. 32, 19, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31 ; PLATES 47, 3, nos. I and 2, 4, no. 9; 48, I, nos. 6, 16, and 22, 2, nos. 4 and 5). Lines composed entirely of these small triangles standing alone are also found sometimes (PLATE 48, I, no. I I).

I 219 sometimes stand above it, and occasionally they cross it. Herring-bone patterns are often found formed by rows of short lines at 450 on either side of a long horizontal (FIG. 32, 26; PLATE 48, I, no. 33)- When the long line is vertical this motive forms the so-called 'tree-pattern'. Rows of chevrons are another favourite, either free-standing or bordered by incised lines (FIG. 32, 34; PLATE 47, 4, nos. 2 and 9), as are zig-zag lines, either singly or in twos and threes (FIG. 32, 28- 30; PLATE 48, 2, nos. 4 and 5; PLATE 49, 2, no. I), and sometimes the latter are combined with a straight line to form a row of wolf's teeth (FIG. 32, 28; PLATE 47, 3, no. 3). Another standard motive is a row of hatched lozenges, which, like the 'tree pattern', is often used as a decoration for handles as well as the sides of vases (FIG. 32, 31). All these patterns are usually arranged in horizontal lines or zones, but in some cases the decoration was arranged diagonally (FIG. 32, 19; PLATE 48, I, nos. II and 16). Rarer than the patterns mentioned in the last paragraph are ladder patterns and large hatched triangles. These are sometimes very like the M.N. ones, though they are often clearly distinguished from those by the irregularity of the execution (FIG. 32, 22, 27, 33; PLATE 47, 4, nos. 3, 5, 6 and 8; PLATE 48, 2, no. 6). The usual types to receive this decoration were fine-ware bowls, generally the type with offset rim, though occasionally it is found on other shapes. The lines were normally filled with white paste. Ripple (PLATE 48, 2, nos. 12-14) Ripple decoration definitely began to be used during E.N. II. Two hundred and thirty- eight rippled sherds were found in Stratum IV in Ac (i.e. 34 per 00oo kg. of pottery), but it was noted that with hardly any exceptions they all came from the upper half of the stratum. Thus it looks as though the idea of exploiting the possibilities of ripple-burnishing for decorative purposes was realized about the middle of the E.N. II phase, though it only attained its full popularity later. MIDDLE NEOLITHIC This period was probably a short one. It is represented in its purest form only in Stratum III B. In III A the beginnings of a development towards the Late Neolithic are already obser- vable. There was, however, very little deposit belonging to III A in Area AC. In the M.N. period the majority of the coarse wares were unburnished, but quite a high proportion had some scribble burnish, though often only on one side (which might be either the interior or the exterior). A smoothed surface was the norm, and in the absence of burnishing pale colours, buff, yellow, and light grey, predominated. Squared and club rims are now well established along- side the rounded and tapered ones (FIG. 33, 3, 9, 10, 13). The fine wares were burnished as usual, and were predominantly black in colour, though some brown and red pieces are found as before. The only real difference between the fine wares of this and the preceding periods from the technical point of view is, as Furness noted, the greater thinness of the walls of some vases. SHAPES Types I, IA, and2 (FIG. 33, I-8; FIG. 34, I-16; PLATE 50, 2, no. 2; PLATE 51, no. I) These all continue to be found quite commonly, but in somewhat changed proportions. The frequency of occurrence of Type I falls off somewhat from 309 in the previous period to 250 per 100 kg. of pottery (1,00oo2 examples were counted). Shape IA, always much rarer, becomes very scarce, being represented by only nine examples, or two per Ioo kg. of pottery.

PT. I 221 the other hand, becomes more frequent than hitherto, rising from o105 to 175 per Ioo kg. of pottery (686 examples counted). Type3A (FIG. 34, 17, 19) After its popularity in the preceding phase, this type now becomes rare. It was found only nine times (2 per Ioo kg. of pottery). Type 3B (FIG. 34, 20-27; FIG. 40, 4; PLATE 44, 3; PLATE 50, I, no. I, 2, nos. 4, 5, 9; PLATE 5I, no. 3) Conversely, this type becomes enormously popular in this phase especially in the form of thin- walled bowls which are about equally wide at the carination and the rim. They are the favourite recipients of the incised and rippled decoration characteristic of the period. One thousand two hundred and fifteen fragments of such bowls were found in Area AC, representing a frequency of 303 per I00oo kg. of pottery. Both 3A and 3B are found exclusively in fine ware (FIG. 47). Types 4 and 4A (FIG. 34, 28-30; PLATE 49, I, nos. 7 and 12; PLATE 50, I, no. 3) The popularity of both these shapes crashes drastically. The numbers of fragments of Type 4 fall from 1,848 in Stratum IV to a mere I86 in Stratum III (or 246 to 46 per Ioo kg. of pottery). The always less frequent Type 4A drops from 322 to 6 occurrences (46 to 2 per 100 kg. of pottery) (FIG. 47). Types 5 to 8 (FIG. 33, 10-I7; FIG. 34, 3I-40) All these continue to be found. There is little to add to what Furness has said about them. Two complete examples of Type 8 were found in the 'pottery pits' above the ruins of House A. (FIG. 42, 2; FIG. 43, I; PLATE 44, I, 2.) Flat-based mugs There were two occurrences of a type of flat-based cylindrical pot, which is not quite the E.N. I type but is nevertheless quite similar in shape. There were also some shallow dishes (FIG. 33, 18; FIG. 34, 47, 51.) Pedestalled bowls (FIG. 34, 46) Three fragments of examples of this shape were found. Hole-mouth pots (FIG. 34, 4I, 42; FIG. 42, I ; FIG. 43, 2; PLATE 43, nos. 5, 6) Two complete examples of large versions of this somewhat specialized shape were found, one in each of the 'pottery pits' in the destruction level of House A. One was fitted with a large trough spout and was of coarse unburnished ware (PLATE 43, no. 6), the other was of fine black burnished ware, but had just a rectangular opening in the side and no spout (PLATE 43, no. 5). The first had two unperforated lugs for handling, the second two ring handles. Several frag- ments of other examples of this shape, mostly much smaller (some very small indeed), and of fine dark burnished ware, occurred in Stratum III. They usually seem to have had two lugs at the top and, where portions of the opening remain, they show no trace of a spout. Beaker withflaring rim (FIG. 4I, 4; PLATE 44, no. 6) A complete example of this shape was found in Area BD. It was of black polished ware. Numerous other fragments were found. 'Ashtray' (FIG. 41, I) One complete example of a small pot resembling the Middle Minoan 'ashtray' was found in the 'pottery pit' in Area BD. It was of coarse ware, neither burnished nor smoothed, and had a dark mottled surface.</page><page sequence="99">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 27 28 29 30 31 26 35 37 33 38 36 34 32 FIG. 58.

I 223 Ladle (FIG. 43, 3; PLATE 44, no. 5) The only complete example found came from the 'pottery pit' in Square D. It was fitted with a handle of the 'long-prong' type. Fragments are fairly common but not very informative. HANDLES AND LUGS Simple perforated lugs, ring handles, &amp;c. (FIG. 33, 27; FIG. 35, 5-12; PLATE 49, I, nos. 13 and 15; PLATE 50, 2, nos. 7 and 8; PLATE 51, no. 3) These are still very much the most common types, the frequency of occurrence being about the same as before, but there are now very few which show the flanged or saddle effect to any marked degree, though quite a few retain slight traces of it. The lugs take on an elegant oval shape, and both lugs and handles are often waisted. Some of the bowls of Type 3B (though not the finest of them) were equipped with at least one ring- or strap-handle running from the rim to the carination (FIG. 35, 26-28, and PLATE 50, 2, no. 8). Small token or 'pellet' lugs are often found on the finest of the carinated bowls, and also sometimes on other shapes, such as jars (FIG. 35, 6; FIG. 40, 4; PLATE 44, no. 3). Some of the larger ones are also left solid. Wishbone handles andprong handles (FIG. 35, 2-3; FIG. 43, 3; PLATE 44, no. 5; PLATE 50, 2, no. 3) One flap handle was found in this stratum, and there were only two finds of knobbed wish- bone handles. On the other hand, there were seven of the ordinary pronged handles and no fewer than 20 of the long-pronged variety (or 5 per Ioo kg. of pottery) (FIG. 45). A complete specimen of a ladle fitted with one of these handles was found in the 'pottery pit' in Square D (FIG. 43, 3; PLATE 44, 5), and well illustrates their use. They sometimes carry ripple decoration. SPECIAL FEATURES Internally thickened rims Six of these were found in this stratum. Spouts (FIG. 35, I4) Only one example, of fine ware, was found in Area AC. The coarse trough spout on the hole- mouth pot from the 'pottery pit' in Square D has already been referred to above. DECORATION Pointill6 decoration (FIG. 35, 13, 16, 17, 27; PLATE 49, I, no. 2; PLATE 50, 1, no. 5) Little decoration of this kind was found. There were 16 sherds altogether with some form of pointilli decoration (4 per o00 kg. of pottery), and none of these was of the E.N. type. Apart from a few with patterns composed of impressed dots unbordered by lines, almost all the remainder consisted of single rows of dots set between parallel incised lines, which might be straight or curved (e.g. FIG. 35, 13, 27; PLATE 50, I, no. 5)- Plastic decoration There was no real plastic decoration of the E.N. type, but there was one example of three small circular lumps arranged in a triangle. Incised decoration (FIG. 35, 18, 19, 21-26, 28, 29; PLATE 49, I; PLATE 50, I and 2, nos. 7, 8) The M.N. incised decoration is easily recognizable from the precision and regularity with which the deeply cut lines have been drawn, and also by the limitation and standardization of the patterns used. Large hatched triangles are the staple (FIG. 35, 21, 26, 28; PLATE 50, I, no. 3), supplemented from time to time by zigzags (FIG. 35, 28), chevrons (PLATE 49, I, no.

I 225 smaller triangles (FIG. 35, 25 and PLATE 50, I, no. 2), and metopes formed by rows of alter- nately plain and hatched rectangles (FIG. 35, 23), all drawn in the same bold and positive style. A characteristic feature of this phase is the practice of drawing an incised line just below the rim all round the vase, presumably in imitation of a beaded or offset rim (though the real thing is very rare) (FIG. 35, 7-9; PLATES 49, I, nos. Io and I I, and 50, I, nos. I and 4). Nine hundred and four incised fragments were counted from this stratum, or 226 per 00oo kg. of pottery, which is a slightly lower frequency than in Stratum IV (FIG. 46). Incised decoration occurs most often on the carinated bowls, but also quite often on narrow-necked jars with globular bodies. Rippled decoration (PLATE 44, no. 3; PLATE 50, 2, nos. 2 and 9; PLATE 51) Ripple-burnishing has long been recognized as one of the chief hallmarks of the M.N. phase. It is not in fact absolutely exclusive to the phase, but by far the greatest quantity of all rippled sherds found does belong to it. The quality of the rippled decoration is also uniformly and excep- tionally good at this time. As can be seen from the histogram (FIG. 46), the bulk of rippled sherds increases quite suddenly at this time, and falls off equally suddenly in the Late Neolithic. One thousand two hundred and eighty-one rippled sherds were counted from the M.N. levels in Area AC, giving a frequency of 320 per ioo kg. of pottery. Ripple burnish was always applied vertically, and it is found principally on carinated bowls (Type 3B) and open bowls of the splayed variety (Type 2). As Furness remarks, these shapes account for a good 90 per cent. of all rippled sherds, though on occasion it was applied also to a number of other shapes. It was normally confined to the exterior, though quite often the open shapes had also a small band of it along the interior of the rim, especially when this was the somewhat everted rim of the carinated bowls (PLATE 51, nos. 4-7). It is sometimes found on prong handles. LATE NEOLITHIC The transition to the Late Neolithic takes place gradually in the course of Stratum II. In a sense the whole of this stratum is transitional. The rippled wares begin to fall off dramatically right away, but the coarse wares, which Furness takes as one of the major criteria, change only slowly to the real Late Neolithic type. The coarse sherds with smoothed finish give way gradu- ally to the red 'wiped' wares which are so characteristic a feature of the Late Neolithic. The 'wiped' wares were well fired, but the surface finish was limited to wiping over the sur- face with a cloth or bunch of grass, leaving a rough surface with perceptible striations. Despite the good firing, indicated by the even red colour which often goes right through the fabric, most of these sherds were in a very friable condition when found, probably on account of their having lain so long near the surface of the Court, exposed to seepage from above. The shapes changed very little from the previous phases. Squared rims are now common. The fine wares are very well fired, and tend to include a greater quantity of brown and light- coloured sherds than before. A feature of this period, not observable in the earlier phases, is the frequent occurrence of very small vases. Some of these (e.g. FIG. 37, 16, 41) were evidently full- size and intended for use. These are finished as carefully as any others by burnishing. Others again are frankly miniatures (FIG. 57, 1-8). These are often rough in execution and may have been made as children's toys, or for some other purpose which did not involve practical use. SHAPES Types I, IA, and 2 (FIGS. 36, I-I I; 37, I-9) These continue to be the most common types, but Type 2 is now more common than Type I.

Type3A (FIG. 37, II) This continues rare, with only 4 occurrences per 100 kg. of pottery. Type3B (FIG. 37, 12-16, 18, 19; PLATE 52, 2, nos. 2 and Io) As in the M.N. phase this is still a very popular shape, but not quite so frequent as in the previous phase, with 187 occurrences per Ioo kg. of pottery. There seems, however, to be a very considerable falling off in the full Late Neolithic, if the figures for Stratum I are taken alone. Only 20 were found in this stratum, as against 915 in Stratum II. As before, all examples are in fine ware. Types 4 and4A (FIG. 37, 17, 27, 28; PLATE 52, I, no. 20; PLATE 53, 3, nos. 4 and 6) There was no recovery in the popularity of these two types, and they continue rare. Type 4 has a frequency of 35 per Ioo kg. of pottery, Type 4A of 2 per Ioo kgs. Type5 This also continued to be rare, with only 4 occurrences. Types 6-8 The first of these is rare, but the two others become more common than hitherto. Flat-based dishes or mugs (FIG. 37, 8) There were a few examples of this shape, and also of a kind of shallow platter (FIG. 37, 32-34). Pedestalled bowls (FIG. 37, 3'I) Fragments of these continued to occur, but were not common. HANDLES AND LUGS Simple perforated lugs and ring handles (FIG. 36, 22-23, 37, 43-48; PLATE 52, 2, nos. 9-11 ) These are still by far the most common of all. The oval and waisted types continue to occur frequently as well as the ordinary type. Very few of the latter show any very marked saddle effect. The oval lugs sometimes occur in batteries of two or three set vertically above each other (FIG. 37, nos. 43, 44). Token or pellet lugs are still common as in M.N. Flap, wishbone, andprong handles (FIG 38, I, 3; PLATE 52, 2, no. 5; PLATE 53, I, no. I) There was only one example of a simple flap handle, and one doubtful occurrence of a simple wishbone handle, but there were eight with short prong and five with long prong (FIG. 45). 'Ears' on rim One example of this trait occurred in Stratum II (unperforated). It was part of a small group of E.N. I type sherds which were obviously out of position. Horns There were two examples of horn-like lugs. SPECIAL FEATURES Spouts (FIGS. 37, 38, 39; PLATE 52, 2, no. 7; PLATE 53, 3, no. 3) Twelve examples of the trough-and-bridge type of spout were found, all in fine ware.

I 229 DECORATION In general, it can be said that decoration in this phase is more varied than before, but the patterns are often smaller and are badly executed, giving a certain effect of half-heartedness. Pointill6 decoration (FIG. 38, 19-25, 27 and 31; PLATE 52, I, nos. I, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14 and 16, 2, nos. 6, 8, 9 and I I; PLATE 53, 2, nos. 4 and 7, 3, nos. I, 2, 4 and 5) There was a considerable revival in the popularity of this during the L.N. There were 64 examples from Strata I and II, or 12 per Ioo kg. of pottery. The patterns were composed of strings of dots between lines, dots, or oval impressions which formed patterns without bordering lines, dots arranged in panels, &amp;c. A new form of pointilli decoration consists of large widely spaced dots and is found on coarse unburnished, though normally quite thin, sherds. Incised ware (FIG. 38, 5-17, 26, 28-30; PLATE 52, I, nos. 3-6, 8-11, 15 and 17-19, 2, nos. 1-4 and Io; PLATE 53, I, nos. 2 and 3, 2, nos. 1-3 and 5-6, and 3, nos. 6-8) There was a considerable amount of incised ware in Stratum II, much of it in the M.N. tradi- tion, though not all. There is much less from Stratum I. The proportion is 642 pieces from Stratum II to a mere 15 in Stratum I. The patterns are often smaller than before and the in- cisions are less deep. The execution is often careless, though sometimes care seems to have been expended on it, but the effect, as Furness remarks, is always mean. Incised decoration is occa- sionally found on coarse unburnished sherds with a buff or grey surface in this phase. They are always parts of closed vessels. There are also some examples of decoration apparently scratched after firing. A distinctive class of incised decoration combined with lines of dots is formed by the 'seam' patterns, which may also be combined with a plastic cordon (FIG. 38, 23 and 25; PLATES 52, 2, no. 8, and 53, 3, no. I). Other types of decoration are ripple, of which some is found in Stratum II and rather less in Stratum I (PLATE 52, I, no. 20), and occasionally horizontal corrugations on the sides of bowls. There were a very few sherds with simple pattern burnish. SMALL FINDS AXES, HAMMERS, CHISELS (FIGS. 48-51; PLATE 54; PLATE 55, 1-3) The main cutting tools used at Knossos seem to have been stone axes and chisels made from various igneous rocks. They were shaped by pecking and grinding; some of the implements had only their cutting edges ground, the rest of the surface being left rough and pitted, others were carefully finished all over. The latter were normally the smaller ones. There were two instances of implements roughly chipped into shape and left in that condition (FIG. 51, I I and PLATE 54, 4, nos. I and 2). Slender tools immediately classifiable as chisels were rare (FIG. 51, 2 and 3; PLATE 54, I, no. 2), but the smallest of the axes were obviously too small and light to have been used for anything but the finer work. There were no adzes. Hammers were often made from axes which had become blunted and unfit for use. Others were more or less axe-like in form, though they may never have been intended as axes. The one shown in FIG. 51I, 1o and PLATE 55, 3, no. 2 is exceptional in that there was no attempt to make it look in the least like an axe, and also in the half-finished tubular perforation. MACE-HEADS (FIG. 52; PLATE 55, 4) These were not found below Stratum VI. The numbers were small in comparison with the number of axes. They were always found broken, and must have been relatively fragile with their</page><page sequence="107">If Is 2f 2b 2s 5f 3f 3b 13s3 5b 5s 4 TOP '4f 4b 4s 6f 6b 6s IOf 10b 10s IIf lib IIs 12 f/b 12 b/f 12 s 13 b 8 f/b 8s 14 f 14b 14s FIG. 62.

Both tubular and hour-glass perforations are found, the most pro- nounced examples of the hour-glass type being from the lower levels. The ones from the upper part of the deposit tended to be larger. One rather exceptional example from Stratum V is decorated with a series of dots. It is of a uniform dark stone, much less heavy than that of the other examples, and it may have been intended for a different purpose, or have been decorative or symbolic, rather than functional (FIG. 52, 13 and PLATE 55, 4, no. 6). The shapes of the mace-heads vary considerably. They may be spherical, biconical, or bun- shaped. QUERNS, MORTARS, PESTLES, RUBBERS, AND POLISHERS (FIG. 53; PLATE 65, 1-3) Querns and mortars were found from time to time throughout the deposit. The exact num- bers found in each stratum are noted in the catalogue. They were most common in the earliest and latest strata. Volcanic rocks, grits, and sometimes limestones were used for their manufac- ture. They were sometimes used as convenient building material when discarded, and were frequently found incorporated into walls, as for example in House c in Stratum VII, and most notably in House E in Stratum IX. The range of shapes is shown in FIG. 53. The typical saddle-shaped quern, though found (PLATE 65, no. 3), was not the most frequent type. More common in this deposit was a roughly rectangular slab with a long oval depression in the upper surface (PLATE 65, 2 top). Some of these, particularly from Stratum IX, look more like rough stone troughs or bowls than real querns. Mortars were not very frequent. Besides the ordinary type (FIG. 5Q, 3) there was a special variety found in the lower strata only, and all but one in Stratum IX. These were quite large elongated pieces of stone which had one or two small cup-shaped depressions in the upper surface (FIG. 53, 4, 5). These could have been used as mortars, though their shape suggests rather pivot stones. Many stones were found which had obviously been used in conjunction with the querns and mortars as pounders and rubbers. Others again had wear which was more probably caused by their being employed for polishing and burnishing. Between Stratum VI and Stratum II a number of pieces of shell were found which seemed to have been put to a similar use, to judge by the signs of wear on them. POT LIDS (PLATE 64) A large number of more or less circular pieces of slate of a variety of sizes from 8 cm. diameter to about 18 cm. were found, which were almost certainly employed to cover the mouths of storage vessels. They were most frequently found in the upper strata, and none occurred below Stratum VII. From Stratum V upwards there were also several examples of roughly conical lumps of lightly baked clay which were probably intended to be used as lids for narrow-necked jars (PLATE 58, 3). In some cases they were even shaped below so as to fit such jars. OBSIDIAN, FLINT, AND ROCK CRYSTAL (FIG. 54; PLATE 63) The finds seem to indicate that implements of chipped stone played only a minor role in the technology of the Neolithic inhabitants of Knossos. Most of the pieces found were small un- retouched chips. Among the unretouched pieces are a few regularly shaped blades, but most were just irregular flakes. Retouch of any kind was a rarity, and recognizable implements were very rare indeed.</page><page sequence="109">15 f 15 b 17 f 17 b 17 s 15 s 18 f 18 b 18 s 16 f 16 b r s Ib s 19 f 19 b 19 s 20of 20b 20 s 21 f 21 s 22f 22b 22s 23 f 23 b 23 s 924f 24b 2Sf 25b 25s FIG. 63.

I 233 Obsidian was most common in Early Neolithic I, and the proportion of larger fragments was definitely considerably higher in the lowest levels than elsewhere in the deposit. Stratum IX and Stratum VIII both produced over Ioo fragments, and in both there was a relatively high pro- portion of pieces with some retouch (25 and 12 per cent of the whole respectively). There was a great falling off in numbers in Stratum VII and Stratum VI, but this was followed by an equally sudden rise again in Stratum V to nearly 200 pieces, though they were mostly very small. In the later strata the numbers were again small. Chert chips occurred in very small quantities right through the deposit without significant variation. There were also a few retouched pieces and implements in this material. Several different varieties of chert were present. The most common was green in colour, speckled with brown, and there were also examples of dark-red, chocolate, and grey material. Stratum III produced seventeen chips of coarse chert. No rock crystal was found below Stratum IV, and only two pieces in this stratum, but there- after chips of this substance became quite common. All were irregular flakes. There were no retouched pieces or implements. Actual implements of chert or obsidian were almost all very small, and there were very few types. There was a fine knife from Stratum VIII (PLATE 63, I, no. 3), and a few roughly pointed pieces (PLATE 63, 4, nos. 9 and Io), but apart from these the types present were confined to small discoid scrapers, of which four were found, small lunates with a sharp, straight, cutting edge and a curved battered back, of which there were five (PLATE 63, I, no. 7, 4, nos. I, 2, and 5), and a single example of a trapeze (FIG. 54, I and PLATE 63, I, no. I). One of the lunates had two notches in the blade (FIG. 54, 2 and PLATE 63, I, no. 7). A very small quantity of raw material would have sufficed to produce the whole of the stone industry found in our soundings. One fair-sized core would account for all the rock-crystal, and perhaps two or three at most for the obsidian. On the other hand, several pieces of chert, possibly from quite different sources, are presupposed by the fragments of this material found, despite the very small number of these, because of the obvious differences in the material represented. SPINNING AND WEAVING EQUIPMENT (FIG. 56; PLATES 56 and 57) The objects found which can be assembled under this heading comprise spindle whorls, mostly of clay (though a number of possible ones are made of stone), clay loom-weights, and clay 'shuttles'. The most interesting fact which emerges about these as a group is that they were concentrated almost entirely in Strata I to III. Two examples of fragments of 'shuttles', and one clay spindle whorl, were found in the upper half of Stratum IV, but below this we found no more loom-weights and nothing which is certainly classifiable as a spindle whorl. There are two perforated stone disks, one from Stratum V and one from Stratum VI, which could be spindle whorls, or might equally well be something else, but there were no examples of the easily recognizable clay ones. A small fragment of a pottery 'shuttle', alleged to have been found in Stratum V, poses some- thing of a problem. It is quite isolated among the finds from the lower strata, and the records show that it was not noticed on the site and treated as a small find, but was picked out from among the pottery from this stratum in sorting. In the circumstances I am inclined to believe that its presence among this material was due to accident or mistake. The evidence therefore seems to indicate that spinning and weaving equipment in clay began to be manufactured only towards the end of the E.N. II period, but this does not necessarily mean, of course, that these processes only became known to the people of Knossos at that time. Perishable materials, or non-artefactual objects, might have been employed to serve these</page><page sequence="111">26f 26 b 26s 27 f 27 b 28f 28s 129 f 29 b 29s 30 f 30s 31f 31 b '31 s 32f 32b 32s 33 f 33 b 33s 35 f/ b i 35 s 34f 34 b 34s 36 FIG. 64.

It is of interest, however, that the evidence of date of introduction seems to point to a real link between the 'shuttles' and the loom-weights and spindle whorls, since this tends to confirm that they were really connected with the weaving industry. The loom-weights (FIG. 56, I and PLATE 56) are sometimes domed with a flat base and two perforations near the top, but some other rectangular or roughly oval objects which have perforations at some or all of the four corners were probably also used for the same purpose. Like the first type, they are sometimes found together in small groups of half a dozen or so. Almost all of them, of both types, were very poorly fired, some hardly at all. There was, however, one finely formed and well-baked rectangular plaque with four corner perforations from Stratum II (no. 59/87, PLATE 57, 1, no. 2), if this is really the same thing. The shapes of the pottery spindle whorls (FIG. 56, Io and PLATE 57, 3 and 4) range from plano-convex and disk-shaped through biconical to flattened globular. They are normally from 3 to 5 cm. in diameter. The biconical section is the most popular, followed by the plano- convex type. The two opposite extremes of bun-shaped and disk-shaped were relatively rare. All the 'shuttles' found had incised decoration of lines and dots, or quite often just dots (FIG. 56, 1-9 and PLATE 57, 2), whereas decoration was very rare on spindle whorls. Only four of all those found had any (and all of these were very badly broken) (PLATE 57, 3, nos. 2, 3, and 6). None of the loom-weights bore any trace of decoration. POTTERY DISKS (PLATE 58, I and 2) These are small, usually rather irregularly shaped, disks cut from sherds which are normally those of burnished fine pottery. Ripple-burnished and even incised sherds were used. They were found first in Stratum VII, and right through to Stratum I. There were particularly large num- bers in Stratum IV and Stratum III (5 1 and 80 respectively). Stratum VII produced 4; Stratum VI, 3; Stratum V, I I; Stratum II, 15; and Stratum I, only I. The disks varied greatly in size (PLATE 58, 2), but were mostly from 2 to 4 cm. in diameter. A small group, however, of two from Stratum VI and one each from Stratum V and Stratum IV, were extra large, having diameters between 5 and 8 cm. Another relatively small group had a central perforation (PLATE 58, I). The earliest example of this kind occurred in Stratum VI, and there were 4 in Stratum V, 2 in Stratum IV, 6 in Stratum III, and I in Stratum II. The ordinary disks could have served for such purposes as tallies, counters in a game, &amp;c. One or two of the extra large ones might have been usable as jar-covers. A special interest attaches to the perforated ones, since they could have been employed as spindle whorls, and it is interesting to note that they appear before the true spindle whorls. LUMPS OF LIGHTLY BAKED CLAY Examples of these were found in a number of strata. They were particularly common from Stratum V upwards. Lumps of clay with impressions of sticks or reeds were, on the other hand, only found in the lower strata of the E.N. I. phase, Stratum VII and below (PLATE 59, I). MINIATURE POTS, ETC. A number of miniature pots were found in the Late Neolithic levels (FIG. 57, 1-8). Furness had already noted that these miniature vessels were characteristic of this phase, and not of the earlier ones. They are mostly shallow saucers or simple bowls, though there are two examples of cups with a tiny handle. Slightly larger vessels, which can still, however, be counted as</page><page sequence="113">236 J. D. EVANS miniature, are shown in FIG. 57, I I-I13, two simple and rather roughly made bowls and a cup set on a solid base. Fragments of clay spoons were found rarely. Three are illustrated in FIG. 57, 15- 17, and what is probably a portion of one in FIG. 29, 17 and PLATE 48, I, no. 32. BONE TOOLS (FIG. 55 and FIG. 61, 11-14; PLATES 60 and 61) Over a thousand bone tools of various kinds were found in the course of the excavations. The general pattern of their distribution through the various strata matched that of the rest of the material-that is, they were most numerous in the strata which produced most pottery and other small finds. The very marked falling off in the number of finds below Stratum VI is as noticeable in the bone tools as in the rest. Points made of flat or tubular bones were by far the most common type. The flat ones were usually manufactured from pieces of rib or other flattish pieces of bone (PLATE 61, 2). They were most often double, having a point at each end, though single ones also occurred. A rather stouter and stronger version was made from a slice cut from a tubular bone. This last type was almost as common as the completely flat kind, but there was always a point at one end only. Tubular bone points of various kinds were the most common of all (PLATE 61, I, no. 3). They were made most often of the ulnas and cannon-bones of sheep or goats. These types were particularly numerous, and alone outnumbered all other types of bone point found. Chisel-ended bone tools occurred regularly, though not in large numbers, throughout the deposit (PLATE 61, 4). Three examples had a curved gouge-like end. Needles (perforated) and pins (unperforated) (FIG. 61, I I, 13 and PLATE 6I, 2, bottom right and left) were also found in considerable numbers. They varied a good deal in size and thick- ness, and no doubt they were put to a variety of uses. Of great interest was the finding of three bone spatulae (FIG. 55 and PLATE 60, 3) in Stratum X in circumstances which may help to confirm the suggestion that they were used for scraping the flour from querns after the grinding process. None had been found previously at Knossos, and no others occurred in any later level. A number of isolated teeth of animals (canines and incisors) were met with in the course of the excavations. It seems at least a possibility that some of these may have been used as small cutting and piercing tools. Boar's tusks, which were also found, might have been used for rubbing and polishing. The sixteen cattle astragaloi found in Stratum V were probably intended for use as gaming pieces. It is interesting to note that Mosso remarked on the frequency of these objects in the Neolithic levels at Phaistos.12 Another similar object, however, was neatly sliced down the centre, and may have served as a rubber (FIG. 61, no. 14 and PLATE 6G, 4, no. I). Two others again were perforated transversely, and might have been whistles (PLATE 60, 4, nos. 2 and 3). BEADS AND PENDANTS (FIG. 58; PLATE 62) These were mostly simple in form and materials. There are disk and spherical beads of stone (FIG. 58, 1-6, II, 12 and PLATE 62, I, no. I) and a few of clay. Natural pebbles with a natural or artificial perforation were also used (FIG. 58, 8-Io, and PLATE 62, I, DOS. II and 12). A variety of simple pendants were found (FIG. 58, 21, 27, 38 and PLATE 62, I, nos. 8, I6, and 17).- An object shaped like a long bent nail, but made of stone, is somewhat puzzling, but was most 12 A.

I 237 probably some kind of pendant or a toggle (FIG. 58, 31). Rather more elaborate and better finished is the decorated clay club-shaped object with a terminal perforation, which was also a pendant (FIG. 58, 38; PLATE 62, 2, no. 2), as perhaps also was the more or less anchor- shaped stone object (FIG. 59, 18 and PLATE 62, I, no. 9). Perforated cardium shells and limpet shells with the central part removed may also have been used as pendants, but it is difficult to be sure whether the perforations are natural or artificial. Several waisted objects of stone (FIG. 58, 22-25 and PLATE 62, I, no. io) look very much like toggles, but they may simply have been a kind of pendant employing this method of suspension rather than a perforation. Stone and bone disks and ovals (e.g. FIG. 59, 5-6) may be partially-finished beads or pen- dants, though in some cases it seems more likely that they were intended for use as burnishers. There were four examples of an especially fine kind of personal ornament. All came from the earliest levels. These were finely worked stone circlets (FIG. 59, 1-4). Three of the four found in these excavations were only small fragments. They were too small to have been worn as bracelets by adults, but might have been worn in this way by children. FIGURINES Thirty-five clearly recognizable anthropomorphic figurines were found in the course of the excavations. A full study of these has been made by Dr. P. J. Ucko in a forthcoming monograph,13 and remarks here are therefore kept to a minimum. A wide variety of styles and materials is represented. Clay is by far the most common material (26 examples), followed at a considerable distance by stone (7 examples). There is only one figurine of shell and one of bone. All the stone figurines come from E.N. I. levels (Strata V and VIII), and except for the small bone one (FIG. 64, 35 and PLATE 66, 2) all the later ones are of clay. The shell example (FIG. 62, Io and PLATE 66, 3) is from Stratum V. The distribution of figurines throughout the strata is markedly unequal. Stratum IX has one figurine, which is of clay (FIG. 62, 4 and PLATE 66, I). This was the earliest found in our excava- tions. In Stratum VIII were found four, three of stone (FIGs. 62, 3, and 63, 15, 16; PLATE 66, nos. 4 and 6) and one of clay (FIG. 62, I). Strata VII and VI produced one each, both of clay. They were respectively the clay head (FIG. 62, 2) and the remarkable portion of a torso (FIG. 63, 20 and PLATE 67, no. I). From Stratum V came seven examples. Two of these were of clay (FIG. 62, 7 and 13 and PLATE 67, no. 3), four of stone (FIG. 62, 8, 9, II, 12 and PLATE 66, no. 5), and one of shell (FIG. 62, IO and PLATE 66, no. 3). Stratum IV was the most prolific of figurines; it produced sixteen of clay (FIGs. 62, I4; 63, 17-19, 21-23, 25; 64, 26-3 I, 33 and PLATE 67, no. 6) and one of bone (FIG. 64, 35 and PLATE 66, no. 2). After this there was a sharp falling off in numbers. Only one figurine was found in Stratum III, which was of clay (FIG. 62, 6). Stratum II produced three, all of clay (FIGs. 62, 5; 63, 24; and 64, 32; and PLATE 67, no. 2). There was none in Stratum I. In style the figurines found ranged from the relatively detailed representation found in the exquisitely proportioned marble figurine from Stratum VIII (FIG. 63, 15 and PLATE 66, no. 6), and the clay torso from Stratum VI (FIG. 63, 20 and PLATE 67, no. I) to a high degree of schematization as in FIG. 63, 18 (in clay), and FIG. 62, 9 (in stone). The series of standing stone figurines could be arranged in a devolutionary series starting with the marble figurine from '3 Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete, (with Comparative Material from the Prehistoric Near East and Prehistoric Mainland Greece (Synaxon Limited), forthcoming. The drawings of the figurines reproduced here (FIGS. 62-64) were prepared by Messrs. M. Weaver and P. Pratt under Dr. Ucko's direction for his work. I am indebted to him for permission to use them also in this report.</page><page sequence="115">238 J. D. EVANS Stratum VIII (FIG. 63, 15) and ending with the stone and shell figurines of Stratum V (FIG. 62, 9-12). However, no such clear trend can be seen in the clay examples, and the few stone figurines found are insufficient to guarantee the validity of any proposed sequence. The bone figurine is unique in Crete, but similar ones were found at Troy. No figurine was found in any definite association with a structure. With the exception of the marble figurine (FIG. 63, 15) and the 'amulet' (FIG. 63, 16), both from Pit A in Stratum VIII, all were found in the dark layers of habitation refuse outside the buildings. Nevertheless, some were grouped together in what seems possibly to be a significant way. The one shell and four stone figurines from Stratum V (FIG. 62, 8-12) were all found in a small area in the eastern part of Square A and under the baulk between Squares A and c. Similarly, all sixteen clay figurines from Stratum IV (FIGS. 62, I4; 63, 17-19, 21-23, and 25; 64, 26-31, 33, and 34) also came from a restricted area of the habitation refuse which composed this stratum in Square A, though from several different levels in it. The roughly oval object with dotted decoration (FIG. 64, 36) is only doubtfully classifiable as a figurine, but it might be a very schematized example. A few other anomalous objects, some at least of which are possibly parts of figurines, are illustrated in FIG. 60o. Of these nos. 6 and, with less certainty, 7 may be claimed as probably portions of anthropomorphic figurines. No. 8 is almost certainly the leg of a stone figurine similar to the group of small standing stone and shell figurines from Stratum V. The rest are much more doubtful, with the exception of no. 4, which is cut from a piece of a decorated pot (now broken into four fragments). The anthropomorphic intention in the head at any rate, with the eyes indicated by a depression on each side, seems evident enough. Few animal figurines were found. Those that were are illustrated in FIG. 60o. Most are frag- ments of clay models of quadrupeds, probably cattle. In one instance at least (FIG. 60, 26) it is quite clear that a bull is represented. Two of the small flattened pieces of clay of the kind which Sir Arthur Evans took to be representations of bull's heads were also found. In both cases the 'horns' had been broken off (FIG. 60o, 23, 24). An exceptional find is FIG. 60, 16, which might be the head of a snake, or possibly of a tortoise. MISCELLANEOUS OCHRE, ETC. Lumps of red and yellow ochre were found in a number of levels. Stratum III produced seven of these, and pieces were also found in Stratum X, Stratum V, and Stratum IV. The tiny piece of malachite and the two pieces of azurite found in Stratum IX were almost certainly prized for their use as colouring materials rather than as copper ores. PUMICE Every stratum produced at least one piece of pumice, and many contained a number of pieces. Its presence on the site is no doubt accounted for by its usefulness as an abrasive. SHELLS AND FISH VERTEBRA The numerous shells found were mostly of cardium, dentalium, limpet, cowrie, with a few whelk and pieces of triton shell. Of them all the cardium is much the most common; many were per- forated at the hinge, though possibly accidentally in most cases. Shells were much rarer in the earlier levels, particularly the lower strata of E.N. I. One fish vertebra was found in Stratum II (PLATE 62, I, no. 5). J. D. EVANS</page><page sequence="116">EXCAVATIONS IN THE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT OF KNOSSOS, 1957-60. PT. I 239 APPENDIX I THE SOURCE OF THE OBSIDIAN FROM THE NEOLITHIC LEVELS AT KNOSSOS The sources of obsidian in the Aegean area are Melos, Antiparos, Giali (a small island north- west of Nisyros), and those of north-west Anatolia. It seems certain that there are no more in mainland Greece or the islands, and none has been reported on or near the coast of western Anatolia further south than Old Phokaia, north of Smyrna. Lipari has also been suggested as a source supplying Crete. The nearest sources in the Balkans, in north Rumania, Hungary, and Slovakia, are probably too distant to be relevant. Trace-element analyses have been conducted on samples from some of these sources and on specimens from neolithic Knossos: 3 from Early Neolithic I, I from Early Neolithic II, and I from the Late Neolithic.I4 The specimens fall into Group I of the classification proposed, characterized by high barium (400 to 2,000 parts per million) and low zirconium (30 to Ioo p.p.m.). The sources of Melos, as well as some more distant ones not here relevant, fall into this group. Lipari, which falls within Group 4a, can be ruled out. So can Antiparos, which on the basis of analyses by Georgiades's will probably fall in our Group 2, 3, or 4a. The source at Giali is low in calcium, which the specimens from Knossos are not. No specimens from the north-west Anatolian sources are available, but the scarcity of arte- facts in that region suggests that they were not used in ancient times. Thus only one obsidian fragment was found at Thermi,'6 and seventeen during the entire course of the Cincinnati excavations at Troy."7 The conclusion from the analyses is thus that the neolithic obsidian of Knossos was imported from Melos. This is supported by the characteristic 'Melian' lustre of the artefacts. While this occurs on rare occasions in other sources, it is present in four out of the five specimens analysed, as well as in the other pieces examined. J. R. CANN A. C. RENFREW APPENDIX 2 TIMBER FROM NEOLITHIC KNOssos, PIT F, STRATUM X, AREA AC, 196o The material was reported to be probably the remains of a stake, consisting of a number of lumps of charcoal of about 1-5-2 cm. measurement along the growth-ring; and from the curve of this ring the stake must originally have been at least some 15-20 cm. in diameter. The timber is undoubtedly a species of Quercus. From comparison with somewhat limited material available from the eastern Mediterranean area it bears much more resemblance to a deciduous than to an evergreen oak. It has large vessels in the early wood, with a sudden transi- tion to very small ones in the later growth. This feature is typical of deciduous oaks, whereas evergreen species usually begin by forming rather smaller spring vessels, and as the season of growth advances the new vessels become smaller gradually. The grouping of the later vessels is also more like a deciduous species, being in broad masses several cells wide rather than in radial strings or pairs of strings. 14 J. R. Cann and A. C.

EVANS This specimen has the broad rays typical of both the deciduous and the evergreen groups. It is also noticeably slow-grown; that is, it has a high proportion of early wood with large vessels and very narrow bands of later or summer wood, which is to be expected in a timber found in an area with a hot, dry summer during which the tree would make little growth. The present vegetation of the district apparently includes evergreen but not deciduous species of oak, but it is probable that before intensive cultivation became widespread the deciduous kinds occurred at lower altitudes as well as at higher. Certainly a number of deciduous species of oak are indigenous round much of the Mediterranean basin, especially along the northern coasts. It is impossible to determine one species of oak from another from the anatomy of the wood, but the structure of this specimen indicates a species of the deciduous rather than of the ever- green group. A. C. WESTERN APPENDIX 3 DIscOID OF PINK, POWDERY MINERAL (59/55) FROM STRATUM III The material appears to have been wetted and moulded into a more or less lenticular mass with the hands. It is very friable in the dry state and easily rubs off on the fingers when handled. It proves to be an extremely well-sorted fine silt, nearly all the individual particles being about 15 P (o.oI5 mm.) in diameter. Something more than 50 per cent. of the particles (at a very rough estimate) are calcite; the remainder mostly quartz. Among the latter are a few coarser grains, up to about 40 o/. There is a very little clay material and a trace of iron oxide, to which the pink colour is due. The origin of the material is not clear. No natural sediment, even loess, is normally as well sorted as this. It may, possibly, have been artificially prepared by repeated suspension and decantation with water, which would not be a difficult operation. Suggested possible uses are: I. As a crayon, applied dry, for decorating surfaces. 2. As a pigment, if first mixed with a suitable fixative vehicle, e.g. fat, oil, white of egg. 3. For cosmetic purposes: dry, as face-powder, painted on or used merely as an absor- bent dusting-powder, as we use talc today. The list is not exhaustive. I. W.
