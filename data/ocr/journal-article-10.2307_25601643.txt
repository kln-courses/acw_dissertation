Appearing for several pages is also John Keats, a "little fellow with clever blue eyes" and "long graying hair" who has quit "versifying" and entered the profession of "kinotropy," entertaining London through shows based on a steam powered technology of moving images.1 As small and fanciful as it is, the Keats cameo is also a provocative one, for two reasons.

Second, Gibson and Sterling quite rightly make this point through the person of John Keats, the British romantic poet whose 1819 poem, Lamia, allegorizes the conflicted social and epistemological principles of visuality implicit in pre- and early cinema as historic institutions of modernity. Keats and his poem occupy this position because of the overlapping mean ings in studies of pre-cinema and the poet (and, indeed, romanticism) of the term sensation. As is well known, Tom Gunning and others have ar gued for a new understanding of cinematic history, in which demonstra tions of early film are in continuity with other nineteenth-century Ameri can, British, and European forms of mass entertainment and public recreation, the spectacle of carnivals, circuses, exhibitions, peep shows, and urban amusements that have come to characterize the advent of capitalist modernity. Early cinema is thus an extension of pre-cinema, rather than a separate social and artistic formation; in Gunning's famous phrase, the dis play and viewing of early film constitute a "cinema of attractions" whose power lies more in technological wonderment over this new medium of the visual than in any glimpse of the future movie-going pleasures of narra tion and character identification associated with classical cinema.2 Like other forms of pre-cinema entertainment, the cinema of attractions is more properly an appeal to the senses; film is a form of sensation, that, as a part of the mass entertainment of the nineteenth-century public, is sensational, and sensationalized. Traditional literary criticism, in an aesthetic manner that at first seems quite different from the socio-historic value of pre-cinema studies, has long 2.

While I am not claiming that visual culture did not change from the beginning to the end of the nineteenth century, I am suggesting that the social relations inherent in Gunning's sense of spectacle and attraction can be used to illumine Keats's era and poetry. The critical language of viewing publics generally informing this piece comes from the tradition of applying and complicating Jiirgen Habermas in work separately done on the British romantic period and also the history of cinema.

Indeed, it is not too much of a stretch to say that Keats is the best argument for an aesthetics of sensation, both the matic and expressive, in English literature. But, of course, that very same characterization has long been used to dismiss Keats, and romantic poetry, as bad literature?or as something besides literature altogether. As with so many critiques of romanticism, this view can be traced back to the writings of that very same era; in this case to the 1818 review of Keats's youthful Endymion and his branding by Blackwood's Magazine as a member of Leigh Hunt's "Cockney School." From the perspective of Blackwood's, and, among others, Byron, Keats's sensuality was the sensation of overly senti mental, flowery writing; the vulgar exhibition of, in Byron's memorable phrase, "a sort of mental masturbation?frigging [Keats's] Imagination.'"4 Since Marjorie Levinson we have been reminded that this estimation was neither simply aesthetic nor sexual, but also laden with class implica tions explicitly condensed in the pejorative social usage by John Lockhart, the Blackwood's reviewer, of "Cockney." For Levinson the meaning of this 3. The tradition of appreciating Keats's sensational nature begins with Arthur Henry Hallam's influential 1831 essay on Keats, Shelley, and Tennyson; it bifurcates in the twentieth century, with one view emblematized by Christopher Ricks's celebration of the sensual as gaudy sensation in Keats, and the (until recently) more influential view held by Helen Vendler, who translates Keats's sensory concerns into a more elevated experience of the poetry's formal properties. Ricks's view has gained momentum precisely to the degree that it connects Keats's oeuvre to a larger social set of meanings for sensational literature. See Arthur Henry Hallam, "On Some of the Characteristics of Modern Poetry, and on the Lyrical Poems of Alfred Tennyson," Englishman's Magazine (August, 1831): i, 616-21, in Keats: The Critical Heritage, ed.

Susceptible of the slightest impulse from external nature, their fine organs trembled into emotion at colours, and sounds, and movements, unperceived or unregarded by duller temperaments. . . . Other poets seek for images to illustrate their conceptions; these men had no need to seek; they lived in a world of images; for the most important and extensive portion of their life consisted in emo tions which are conversant with sensation" (Matthews 267). 4.

WANG interpellation is a reflexive, petty bourgeois class anxiety that colors Keats's oeuvre in rich, complex ways. James K. Chandler has suggested otherwise, that "cockney sensationalism" might very well "have to be understood in some kind of tension with, and some kind of alternative to, that regnant bourgeois domain."5 Whether Levinson or Chandler is correct about the class register of Keats's work, their discussion stresses how, as a poetry of sensation, Keats's writing occupies an especially volatile position in his era's sense of mass and elite culture?categories that historically begin to take on their modern, or postmodern, meaning at that very moment in time. Im plicit in the opprobrium of Blackwood's and others is that Keats's writing is not real poetry, and, thus, not real literature. It is sensation as entertain ment; sensation not as an elite aesthetic principle but as one diversion among many for a growing, increasingly commercial, mass public. It is sen sation in the social sense of the pre-cinema. It is also like the pre-cinema in its relation to visual sensation, an implicit point of Byron's remark about Keats's stylistic onanism?insofar as its folly lies both in its exhibitionist nature and the underlying association of masturbatory fantasy with the virtual nature of the image, a link made in the writings of a number of eighteenth-century and romantic writers, in cluding Blake, Wollstonecraft, and Rousseau.6 One detail of Lockhart's re view emphasizes the social character of this visual condition. Derisive of Keats's criticism of Pope and Boileau, Lockhart notes how they, unlike the Cockneys, never chose to "exert their faculties in laborious affected de scriptions of flowers in window-pots, or cascades heard at Vauxhall. "7 As much as Lockhart's reference to flowers in window-pots would have signified petty bourgeois life, his allusion to Vauxhall Gardens would have 5. Levinson 1?38; and James K.

The site of spectacles, shows, and entertainment in London throughout most of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth century, Vauxhall in Keats's and Lockhart's time was increasingly associated with recreation for the middle-class, as well as a more diversified mass pub lic. While any cascade heard there would, of course, have been artificial, Lockhart's dig could very well have been even more pointed, since one of the most famous (and ridiculed) attractions at Vauxhall was the "tin cas cade," which created the illusion of a mill's moving water through sheets of tin.8 As such the tin cascade was a symbol of visual attraction in its crud est, most hokey, social marketability. To have been poetically inspired by, to have "heard," the tin cascade would have meant enacting the most pain ful social and perceptive error, an accusation of cultural maladroitness that Lockhart levels at Keats and his comrades through the inappropriate mix ing of poetry and commercialized visual sensation. The tin cascade was a staple of Vauxhall for many years, going back to the eighteenth century, where it appears in both Burney and Smollett. As Richard Altick's monumental Shows of London demonstrates, it and other attractions at Vauxhall were only a few of the many exhibitions, fairs, spec tacles, and side-shows that characterized the London of both Keats's time and the later Victorian era, so much so that Edward Bulwer wrote in 1831 about "that love of shows, / Which stamps [the English] as the 'Staring Nation.'"9 Crowds came together to see hot-air balloons, fireworks, zoo 8. Richard D. Altick, The Shows of London (Cambridge, MA: Belknap P of Harvard UP, 1978) 95- Altick describes the cascade as "evidently ... an offshoot of the moving picture" (95).

WANG animals, mechanical automatons, wax figures, medical curiosities, scientific displays, ancient relics, Orientalist memorabilia, and various non-European examples of the noble savage. As Laurent Mannoni's equally imposing The Great Art of Light and Shadow relates, the pre-cinema was very much part of this increasingly complex and robust economy of public, mass viewing. Chief among the pre-cinema of this time was the phantasmagoria, an espe cially vivid form of the magic lantern show that involved the illusory movement of images through their shrinking and enlargement; and the panorama, an immensely huge circular painting that formed its own virtual landscape reality (and about which Wordsworth wrote in Book 7 of The Prelude). As Mannoni adumbrates about the magic lantern and other optical illusions, "In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries only a blind person would have been unaware of their charms and effects."10 To situate Keats and his poetry within this social milieu is to extend but also to modify our sense of romanticism's relation to the image. W. J. T. Mitchell and William Galperin have both argued for the forceful presence of the visual in romantic writing, how the image aroused in the romantics conflicted feelings of investment and resistance even as its power and char acter became dominant tropes in a number of writers' works.11 A concern with the visual and plastic arts is also obviously the case with Keats, a cir cumstance that a long tradition of scholarship centered on "Ode on a Gre cian Urn" as ekphrastic poetry upholds. My thesis differs from this tradition in Keats studies in two ways. First, such criticism tends to see the image in Keats as a static, frozen entity, opposed to the flowing temporality of the written word. While art writing from the Hunt circle certainly supports this view, I believe there is in Keats a more capacious dialectic between the still and the moving image.12 Keatsian sensation also connects the romantic io. Mannoni 103. See also, however, the argument in Crary's Techniques that Renaissance modes of observation associated with the camera obscura differ markedly from nineteenth century techniques of viewing, especially those associated with the 1830s stereoscope. 11. W. J. T. Mitchell, Picture Theory: Essays on Verbal and Visual Representation (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1994) 114-15; Galperin 19-33. F?r the argument that situates this relation within the specific historical context of the conflict between "Romantic, expressive theories of artistic production" to "a new commercial visual-cultural industry of mass reproduction, spectacle, and simulation," see Wood 1-15. Yet see also Galperin's claim about how the tra ditionally "romantic opposition of the verbal and the visual as expressive and mimetic media" actually "obfuscate[s] . . . those larger cultural imperatives (or, as the case may be, im peratives against culture) that are demonstrably cross-generic and sufficiently prolific that a literary artifact may in the end have more in common with a Diorama or a photograph than with a painting" (30). My argument about Lamia is that the poem takes this commonality quite seriously, especially in terms of the commercial, recreational moving image. 12. For one in-depth look at the Keatsian dialectic between moving word and still art, see Grant F. Scott, The Sculpted Word: Keats, Ekphrasis, and the Visual Arts (Hanover and London: UP of New England, 1994).

This kinetic promise in romanticism is neither simply a formal nor technical matter, but more crucially a social issue, which leads to my second point, that the aesthetic, psychological, and philosophical stasis associated with the Keatsian image is itself based on an historical reification: the notion that Keats's imaginative forum for viewing is the socially and economically secure modern mu seum, where his sculpted and painted figures, silent and still, reside. Hence Philip Fisher's strangely appropriate remark about the "Grecian Urn" as a museum with one work inside; the canniness of this observation must, however, be qualified, insofar as museum displays still very much belonged in early nineteenth-century Great Britain to the larger, more socially com bustible realm of amusement exhibition.13 As Altick explains, it was not until the 1860s that the "age of exhibitions was succeeded by the age of public museums."14 In Keats's time the display of objects today associated with either the art gallery or museum?objects from antiquity and paintings?was often done in the showman's hall. In deed, after the destruction of Church relics during the seventeenth century, the non-aristocratic public viewing of art depended heavily on such ven ues. Even upper class viewings of paintings, such as the 1787 Royal Acad emy exhibition at Somerset House, eschewed any notion of the solitary collector or museum goer contemplating the isolated art object?the social and visual energies of Martini's engraving of the exhibition {fig. 1), with numerous paintings stacked on top of one another and the aristocratic crowd engaged in conversation (tellingly, Joshua Reynolds is equipped with an ear trumpet) are anything but that.15 Cruikshank's 1835 etching of another Royal Academy exhibit, "All Cockney-land" (fig. 2), depicts the 1967). Scott observes that Keats's art subjects "are not originals but reproductions, copies, restorations" but also argues that the poet's ekphrasis is "about moving the visual object from its original residence into the house of words and restoring and revivifying it." But Scott also believes that in "trying to move closer to the original works of art, Keats only establishes all the more distance from them and hence his modernity" (Scott 19). My suggestion is that for Keats the display of the "original" art-piece is already to some degree informed by the visual modernity of London's shows. 13.

WANG "middle-classification" of these same motifs, with one noticeable difference being the upward gazes and open mouths of Cruikshank's central figures, as opposed to the generally downward aristocratic glances of those at Somerset House. In that light perhaps Keats's greatest poetic, and ideologi cal, achievement as a "Cockney" was the level attention that the poet trained on what he wrote. Regardless, such depictions connect artworks and their images to a social kinesthesia that traditional notions of Keats and art foreclose. At the same time, he and his friends certainly had the opportunity to attend collective viewings where people did not converse so avidly, but where the object displayed was also an optical trick or apparently moving image. One well known commercial venue begun in the 1820s, the Cosmorama, displayed examples of still art and a sophisticated version of the peep show simulta neously (fig. 3). Keats, of course, died in 1821; nevertheless, the multi media Cosmorama demonstrates the interpenetrating economies of com mercial and aesthetic display that he and his circle of London friends knew. As a decidedly cosmopolitan group of writers and artists, the Hunt coterie were very much active in this volatile world of public exhibition, in all its forms. While we remember the painter Benjamin Haydon for trying to en sure that the Elgin Marbles would be displayed somewhere devoid of "squalor and peril" we have pretty much forgotten Leigh Hunt's later at tempts to reform the conditions at the Regent's Park Zoo.16 Still, of per haps all of Keats's close friends, Haydon most vividly embodied the con nection between London elite and popular visual culture. While grumbling about how England's "leading historical painters should be obliged to ex hibit their works like wild beasts, and advertise them like quack doctors," Haydon himself did not shy away from entrepreneurial showmanship.17 The 1820 exhibition of a number of his canvases, including his huge Christ's Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem, was very much a sensational happen ing, with both Keats and Hazlitt attending; it was done in William Bull ock's famous Egyptian Hall, a forum for a number of commercial attrac tions, including Napoleon's carriage. The link in Haydon between art and show was also aesthetic technique. As an avid devotee of the cult of the im 16. Altick 415. Hay don's attempts were less than successful, as Keats's own viewing of the Marbles was in very lowly conditions, as until 1831 the British Museum kept them "in two frame sheds adjoining Montagu House, firetraps which would have seen the precious booty destroyed if they had ignited" (Altick 415). At one point the British zoos were the hottest tickets in town; as Altick wittily notes, Hunt's sympathy with the plight of the Regent's Park Zoo animals might have had something to do with his own two years behind bars for libeling the Prince Regent (Altick 415). 17.

WANG mense, Haydon championed a pictorial vision that in many ways drew sty listic comparisons between his paintings and the gigantic objects of the panorama (and later diorama) shows. Keats's own letters refer to both the panorama and the phantasmagoria.18 Perhaps even more germane to my thesis, Jeffrey Cox has recently argued for the active presence of commercial exhibition in Keats's greatest contri bution to elite aesthetic culture?how the "fair attitude" of the "Attic shape" in "Ode on a Grecian Urn" refers to Emma Hamilton, "wife of the one-time owner of the Portland Vase, Sir William Hamilton, and mistress of Admiral Nelson."19 The daughter of a blacksmith, Hamilton got her start working in the world of attractions, such as James Grahams' "Temple of Health" and its "Celestial Bed" which claimed to cure the reproductive and sexual problems of couples renting it for the night. After marrying Lord Hamilton she became famous for what were literally her fair atti tudes?her poses within a blackout box as a number of characters from 18. On seeing the panorama Keats writes, "I have been very much pleased with the Pan orama of the north Pole?with the icebergs, the Mountains, the Bears the Walrus?the seals the Penguins?and a large whale floating back above the water?it is impossible to describe the place" (The Letters of John Keats: 1814-1821, vol. 2, ed. Hyder Edward Rollins [Cam bridge: Harvard UP, 1958] 95). His 1820 citing of the phantasmagoria is especially suggestive. Writing to Fanny Brawne about his health, Keats reports that "I rest well and from last night do not remember any thing horrid in my dream, which is a capital symptom, for any organic derangement always occasions a phantasmagoria" (Letters 247). For Keats the phantasmagoria is ubiquitous enough to work as a figure for his own mental state, the "horrid" symptom of his possible "organic derangement." (Altick also mentions references to the phantasmagoria in Byron and Martineau [Altick 219, 233]). Keats's usage evinces a knowing sense of the popular phantasmagoria, whose images were oftentimes that of spirits, ghosts, and ghouls. The letter's blending of mind and phantasmagoria also has tantalizing implications for any ac count of Keats's imagination. When Ian Jack, for example, notes how the figures in "Ode on Indolence" differ from those on a true vase in that they move, the critic's point is that such movement could only happen in Keats's imagination (Jack 246). But what if the imagined revolution of the urn's figures knows itself through an optical toy like the rotary lantern (the lanterne vive) and its cut-out shadows? Keats's correspondences also refer to the days spent sleeping recovering from an accident that generated the ode's ambience, a situation that would not be the last time a psychic state was mediatized in a specific fashion, something given more edge by the poem's particular content, its putative rejection of the waking world of literary commerce and entertainment, the potential situation of the poet as "pet-lamb in a sentimental farce." Rather than simply demarcate a boundary between the waking social and dreaming interior worlds, the in-between semi-conscious state of the rotary lantern would indicate a more complex, and ambiguous, dialectic between private bourgeois and commer cial existence. For an extended discussion of the relation of the phantasmagoria to the ro mantic and nineteenth-century mind, see Castle 43-61. See also note 29. 19. Cox 169. The Portland vase was, of course, one possible model for Keats's ode. So Lord Hamilton's proprietary relations literally connect the realms of commercial and aes thetic exhibition, as well as stress the economies of gender and sexuality involved in such dis play.</page><page sequence="13">LAMIA AND CINEMATIC SENSATION 473 Greek antiquity. To think of such public exhibition as one representational model for Keats's urn is to associate the erotic and visual qualities of Keats's classicism with a suddenly more dynamic, topical, and commercial realm. No longer simply the result of an "abstract Romantic classicism," the "Grecian Urn" becomes a much more complex negotiation between the imaginary space of the museum and that of Hamilton's "arty strip show."20 As a performance, Hamilton's display of attitudes also indicates the com plex relation of the world of shows to theater. In sharp contrast to Gunning's description of early cinema, David Bordwell has famously ar gued that classical cinema derives its genealogy from the pleasures of narra tive and character-identification associated with the "well-made play."21 Yet, against Bordwell, we need to remember the degree to which theater itself overlapped with the sensation of nineteenth-century English exhibi tion and shows. Within this imbrication there were a number of cultural productions that would fall between both categories, such as Hamilton's at titudes, various pantomimes, monodramas, and Tableaux vivants. More over, the tension between narrative and sensation also existed within the ater. When in 1802 Wordsworth condemned the numbing of human spirit by the escalating sensations of urban life, the overly mediatized "rapid communication of intelligence" and "craving for extraordinary incident" that reduced the minds of city inhabitants to a "savage torpor," his exam ple, for which his poetry was the antidote, was the gothic hit of "sickly and stupid German tragedies" that reigned over London at that time.22 (In 20. Cox 150, 168-72. Cox's argument is that Keats explicitly tries in his ode to restore to art the Benjaminian "aura of the classic . . . beyond the diminution of [art's] power through endless imitation" (155). 21. The crux of the distinction between Bordwell and Gunning is the former's ideologi cal sense of cinematic history (with a special sense of classical cinema as the apex of that his tory) versus the latter's more unruly sense of that history, with the conventions of cinematic narrative caught in an ongoing dialectic with various forms of attractions, or what I call sen sation.

C. WANG Wordsworth, of course, a love of sensation found its most pure expression in the ultimate staging of modernity's error, the French Revolution.) In deed, during the teens and twenties there was much sentiment that visual spectacle had taken over the production of London theater, a criticism that was made well into the Victorian era. Sensation, then, could exist within a genre or medium as well as appear exterior to a certain art form. It named the set of social relations that a cul tural production actively existed within, as well as the types of publics and audiences that the cultural work reflected, imagined, and produced. It also marked the degree to which such relations were antagonistic, adversarial as well as dynamic in terms of what was being defined, represented, and en forced. To situate Keats's work within this world of mass exhibition is not to collapse all these genres, media, and publics together; far from it. There is, of course, a material limit to the resemblance between the reception and consumption of print culture and those of exhibits and shows. (Likewise, simply assuming that Keats actually had a mass readership, in terms of both size and diversity, is complicated at best.) Also, obviously, the public expe rience of certain media was historically longer and more involved than oth ers. Scholars such as Jon Klancher and Iain McCalman have demonstrated how within just print culture alone a number of distinct audiences grew around such disparate print forms as poetry collections, novels, middle-class journals, radical and reform newspapers, and pornography.23 Within and beyond print culture, the vitality of this social world can only be sensed by appreciating the variety of publics exploding at this time. The point would be, however, to recover this very sense of explosive growth, a dynamic that allows for a much more diffuse set of boundaries among all these various publics.

But the tendency has been, even in this post-New Historicist age, more "extra"-disciplinary than in terdisciplinary; there is usually an underlying assumption of the historically secure, intrinsically stable nature of the cultural work (literature and the fine arts, for example) being brought together?if not in social reality then at least in Keats's mind. Even to consider the presence of the pre-cinema in Keats, however, is to conceive of his emphatic relation to a much more so cially combustible arena in which a number of a cultural activities collided and overlapped, even as tremendous energy was expended to define one against the other. The habit in Keats studies of reifying such activities as sharply distinct identities points to a process already actively taking place and being interro gated in the poet's work. Keats is the English poet of mediated cultural ex perience par excellence, a characterization that would also include, as the poem, "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer," suggests, his experi ence of literature.24 As such his work powerfully demonstrates how these mediations come to be separated and recognized as autonomous modes of activity. He remains an especially apt gauge for the intensely complex Brit ish romantic construction of elite, mass, and private cultural experience. In and beyond Keats the use of sensation, as both opprobrium and self advertisement, becomes one especially vivid way these hegemonic articula tions are troped. In turn the sensational (or, in Keats's case, masturbatory) image becomes a reflexive sign of the virtual nature of those identities striving for social distinction, of, indeed, distinction itself. At the same time the voyeuristic consumption of the sensational image paradoxically implies the opposite of reflexivity: an overwhelming, mind less immediacy. It seems more than historically fortuitous that early nine teenth-century England also witnessed a noticeable growth in pornogra phy, something Lockhart implicitly accuses Keats of by opining about the "prurient and vulgar lines" of a love poem that Keats wrote for his brother George to give to Mary Frogely (McCalman 215). For Lockhart the pruriency seems to come from not only an improper physicality titillatingly described but also a gross, non-ethereal immediacy. As Bulwer's epithet the 24. The very phrase "Looking into" implies the visual nature of this mediation, as if to accomplish this literary experience Keats must first look into the physical object that is Chapman's book. This sense of mediation is already implicit in traditional praise for the allu sive studiousness and technical accomplishments of Keats's verse. But see also Levinson's claim about the virtual character of Keats's literariness, the degree to which he "produces a writing which is aggressively literary and therefore not just 'not literature' but, in effect, anti Literature: a parody" (Levinson 5). Indeed, Keats's intense awareness of the different ways that culture (including "literature" but also the plastic arts) is produced further suggests read ing his work as commenting on the straddling of various forms of cultural labor.</page><page sequence="16">476 ORRIN N. C. WANG "Staring Nation" implies, the London world of shows also seemed espe cially to draw upon the pornographic power of visual sensation in this larger sense of a powerful, nonreflective immediacy, a trait that Jameson's characterization of film also cites. Arguably, romanticism provides us with many of the moralistic, class, and ideological codes still used to express both social anxiety over and attraction to such forceful, unreflective immedi acy?a filmic potentiality that some might say has been exponentially real ized today by the domination of Hollywood by special effects and the global proliferation of video and the Web.25 If, during romanticism, individuals both attacked and defended specific attempts of supposedly elite culture as or against the charge of porno graphic sensation, the entrepreneurs behind London's commercial attrac tions also represented their spectacles as something besides sensational im mediacy. The discursive internalization of this dialectic between sensation and its "other" runs through many of the disparate modes of cultural activi ties during this time. If literature had a complex, ambivalent relation to sensation, so did sensation itself. London exhibitions, including those of the pre-cinema, most forcefully expressed this ambivalence through the ten sion between their twin missions of entertainment and education. The panorama, for example, was generally considered much more of an ele vated cultural experience, full of historical and world information, than the spooky phantasmagoria.26 Yet those behind the phantasmagoria also insisted 25. Wordsworth's 1798 poem, "Tintern Abbey," a flight away from a pornographic rela tion of mindless sensation with nature that is also an account of spiritual maturation and changing political affiliation, might be profitably read in this light. So too even more explic itly could "cockney sensationalism," though, as Chandler indicates, in a way that very much diverges, aesthetically and politically, from Wordsworth's. As Geraldine Friedman's reading of Keats's Hyperion suggests, the story of progress and redemption from the senses never in spired, or oppressed, Keats in the same way that it did the older poet (9, 91-112).

For a study of the impact of the panorama on nineteenth-century bourgeois con sciousness, see Stephan Oetterman, The Panorama: History of a Mass Medium, trans.

Indeed, the projected im ages of the phantasmagoria, especially in late eighteenth- and early nine teenth-century France, were oftentimes recently deceased historical per sonages such as Benjamin Franklin, Voltaire, and leaders of the French Revolution. Likewise the showmen of the phantasmagoria would claim that their spectacles served the science, rather than the magic, of image making. Yet equally insistent by others was the opposite view, that the showmen produced "illusions of pure charlatanism" and fantasy.27 As much as the images of the phantasmagoria were from topical history, they were very much ghosts; indeed, the implicit uncanniness of their conjuration was emphasized by the other staple of images of the phantasmagoria, truly frightening phantasms and creatures from the world of the supernatural and myth. In England the subject matter and scary presentation of the phantas magoria (which means in Greek "[With] ghosts I speak") was especially as sociated with the gothic craze of Radcliffe's novels and Wordsworth's "sickly" German dramas. These oppositions?between sensation and thought, show and fine art, entertainment and education, pornographic and proper viewing, and magic and science?also structured the more properly "commercialized Classi cism" drawn upon equally by elite and mass culture. Many exhibits like Graham's "Temple of Health" employed motifs from Greek mythology; many?noticeably those of the pre-cinema?took their names from the Greek language: the Eidophusikon, Cosmorama, Eidoprotean, panorama, and phantasmagoria, for example. As the entomology of phantasmagoria lit erally indicates, the meaning of such Greekness could easily mix with the popular mass entertainment of the gothic. Greek antiquity could stand for the modernity of science as well as (along with Egyptomania) the gnostic knowledge or Orientalist magic of the past. Its replicated or imagined physical spaces could be the site of either higher learning or popular diver sion. And its eros could be embodied by either aesthetic desire or commer cialized libido. Its display could be aesthetic experience or entertainment as aesthetic experience. Greek antiquity provided a "surface of inscription" for all these heterogenous social and epistemological energies.28 It's not too much of a stretch to take Laclau's textual term and say that the literal form of this interstice in Keats's time was the surface of projection of the phantas magoria and other optical shows.

C. WANG edge for the mass audience, the a priori mediation of culture that was also the paradoxically raw material of Keats's poetic career. But, as any serious reader of Keats knows, the virtual is not simply some thing to be dismissed. Neither is that the case with the spectacle of Lon don's shows. To begin to understand the full meanings of social exhibition in Keats is to link these two worlds together. Indeed, Keatsian sensation can be seen as occupying that strange indeterminate point when genre be comes a medium?when, as a genre of literature, the poetry of sensation is contrasted with high literature and deemed non-literary; and, conse quently, as non-literature, finds its socio-cultural meaning in the same realm as the media of the pre-cinema. To consider Keats's literary work also as a form of pre-cinema sensation is to remember keenly the degree to which the struggle over such distinctions and their enforcement was a product of the romantic era. It is also to ask how much a poem by Keats might reflexively thematize the question of sensation as a social issue, a "social relation" in the manner of Debord's emphatic definition of the spectacle. The pre-cinema suggests a new way to understand the staging of action in The Eve of St. Agnes and the overload of sensation in "To Autumn"; it could perhaps explain the revolving figures in "Ode on Indolence" through the mediality of a lanterne vive or another revolving optical toy, while imparting perpetual motion to the "mad pursuit" of the "Ode on a Grecian Urn" through the same device.29 But all such formulations depend on the social argument found in another of Keats's works, one especially engaging in its sustained allegory of Keatsian sensation as the reception of the pre-cinema by a public, mass audience. I am certain there is that sort of fire in it, which must take hold of people in some way?give them either pleasant or unpleasant sensa tion. What they want is a sensation of sort. John Keats on Lamia, Letter to George and Georgiana Keats, September 18, 1819 Its classical setting understood within the broader field of commercialized Grecian attractions, and its visual appeal especially understood through the 29. If the figures in "Indolence" literally seem to revolve, the figures in the "Urn" are on a round, continuous surface, which when (mentally, if not actually) turned could act like a pre-cinema optic toy, giving the illusion of moving images. The eternal nature of the "mad pursuit" on the urn would then not so much be static as perpetual, a harbinger of the furious motion characterizing the large number of chase scenes reflexively allegorizing film's own ki netic abilities in early cinema. I am indebted to Jonathan Auerbach for this observation; for an exploration of such chase scenes in early film, see his "Chasing Film Narrative: Repeti tion, Recursion, and the Body in Early Cinema," Critical Inquiry 26 (Summer 2000): 798? 820.

In doing so, Lamia comments not only on the history of the visual, but also on the very nature of such a history, on how cinematic history might actually begin before the apparent object of its narrative, film technology, appears. In particular, the thematic rendering of visuality and sensation in Lamia implies a disjuncture between itself and the pure unreflective immediacy of sensation, a reflexive dilemma at the constitutive heart of Keats's poetry. As much as the aural and formal qualities of Keats's work might engender a sensual immediacy, or as much as the textuality of his writing seems to strive, at another level, toward something like, after Deleuze and Guattari, a sensation without organs, the very anticipation of such goals within Keats's work ensures their failure?a situation that "Ode to a Nightingale" most famously narrativizes. A certain reflexivity characterizes the social and epistemological sensation of Keats's work, which Lamia is able to use proleptically to delineate a predicament that spans not only pre- and early, but also classical and post-cinema as well. As a knowing example of Cock ney sensation, Lamia demonstrates how visuality becomes the preeminent recourse for negotiating between sensation and its abstraction in modernity, a task that until this last decade's video and digital explosion, has been most vividly associated with film.30 The abstraction of meaning and narrative from sensation is very much the critical pleasure connected with classical narrative cinema, what, ac cording to Bordwell, distinguishes this stage of film production and view ing from early and pre-cinema. But this action also replays the social ten sions between thought and sensation, art and show, science and magic, and education and entertainment that structure early nineteenth-century Eng land mass and elite cultural experience. By reflexively thematizing the dia lectic between sensation and its abstraction, Lamia places that dynamic within the poem's own critical horizon, instead of visa versa. In doing so Keats's poem proleptically reworks Gunning's seminal term for early cin 30. This negotiation subtends, of course, many of our meta-narratives about the modern. Habermasian modernity, for example, depends upon vehemently distinguishing between the abstraction of a disinterested public sphere and the sensation (visual or otherwise) of mass capitalist life. For a relevant critique of that distinction, see Michael Warner, "The Mass Pub lic and the Mass Subject," in Habermas and the Public Sphere, ed. Craig Calhoun (Cambridge, MA: MIT P, 1994) 377-401. For an intense exploration of how the opposition between sen sation and abstraction, or the "tyranny of the eye" versus the "tyranny of conception," cre ates the reflexive space for a "subjectivity-in-default or in distraction," see Galperin 1-33. My work abuts on but also diverges from Galperin's seminal study precisely insofar as I use Lacan's concept of the gaze to question the reification of subjectivity that occurs when Lamia's visibility is conceived in terms of an agency.</page><page sequence="20">480 ORRIN N. C. WANG ema by foregrounding two meanings implicit in the idea of attraction, sensa tion as the locus for both desire and bodily motion. Lamia anticipates a ne gotiation between Lacanian and neo-Habermasian concepts of visuality as markers for social, public, and somatic desire. Specifically, Keats's poem poetizes the relation between such desire and the ocular mystery of mass culture's commodity form. Simultaneously, Lamia also propounds a spe cifically cinematic notion of the image, insofar as it plays off the dynamic between still and moving corporeality. Much as Jonathan Auerbach has ar gued that narrative, through the moving body, actually exists in the early cinema of attractions (798-820), so too does Keats's work instill within its dialectic between sensation and abstraction the concept of visuality as the story of kinetic embodiment, of cinema as the active imaging, or imagina tion, of the body. The body most looked upon in Keats's poem is Lamia's. Much like the optic dynamics involving urn and "Ode on a Grecian Urn," the "diegetic" viewing of Lamia coincides with the audience's experience of Lamia, the poem. Unlike Keats's ode, this exchange is not simply fetishized as the look of a solitary observer. Instead, the poem indicates the social, plural nature of the reception of Lamia, and Lamia. As Chandler has observed about the poem, the "critical response to the creature named in the title seems to de stroy her/it?the poem stages within its narrative an account of its own re ception by a reviewing public" (531). While that critical response might first and foremost be associated with the icy stare of Apollonius, the mo ment of (re)viewing takes place within the public forum of Lamia's and Lycius' wedding and also involves the visual participation of Lycius and a number of onlookers. Within a more biographical vein Susan Wolfson has specified the audience involved in Lamia's viewing: the reading public that Keats felt compelled to serve, also reflexively characterized by the "herd" of wedding guests, who "each . . . with busy brain, / Arriving at the portal, gaz'd amain, / And enter'd marveling" (2.150-51).31 Whether Keats really did resent a public intent on a "sensation of sort," it does seem that Lamia allegorizes the mass reception of that attraction, a sensation embodied by the poem's titular character. For both Chandler and Wolfson the scopic nature of public reception in the poem stands for a specifically literary form of activity; seeing Lamia means reading Lamia. But if that scopic nature is taken literally, if we take seriously the proposition of Lamia as visual sensation, a more complicated sense of the public emerges, one that would connect Lamia's literary sensa tion to that of the world of London's shows and pre-cinema.

(And this housing of mass view ing, the mixing of interior space and publicness, certainly does express the social dynamic and architecture of many London shows.) But an earlier passage is also pertinent in developing the sense of public viewing in Keats's poem, the description of Corinth when Lamia and Lycius enter the city gates together: As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all, Throughout her palaces imperial, And all her populous streets, and temples lewd, Mutter'd, like tempest in the distance brew'd, To the wide-spreaded night above her towers. Men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours, Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white Companion'd or alone; while many a light Flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals, And threw their moving shadows on the walls, Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade Of some arch'd temple door, or dusky colonade. (i.350-61) Ostensibly more real than the (supernatural setting of the lovers' initial meeting, Corinth is likened to being in a dream-state. Levinson has sugges tively explained this dreaminess as emblematic of Corinth as the social manifestation of the commodity-form, a predicament that plays off Cor inth's historical reputation in antiquity as a site of both intense commerce and the "temples lewd" of prostitution.32 We can also add to that the de scription in Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, Keats's inspiration for the poem, of Lamia taking Lycius to her house in the "suburbs of Corinth. "33 Living in Hampstead and elsewhere, decidedly cosmopolitan but deni grated as either middle-class or lower, Keats and his Cockney colleagues were members of London's new suburban urbanity. More social ambience than simply geographic location, suburban describes Keats's material relation to London, something that the poem's opening lines on Corinth also sug gestively register in their particular detailing of the commercial world.

C. WANG Lamia is actually somewhat hidden in these lines, its anxieties reflexively displaced by the image of a "tempest in the distance" brewing, but also its daily enterprises supplanted by those of the "wide-spreaded night." In such "cool hours" commerce is predominantly designated by entertainment and pleasure, activities that the relationship between Lamia and Lycius also very much combines. We might also venture to say that such entertainment is oftentimes visual, another key component of the lovers' relation. In that sense the commodified sexual favors of the "temples lewd" could refer as much to the eros of housed exhibitionism and voyeurism as to any true bodily contact. Similarly, the "wealthy" in "wealthy festivals" needs not so much name the customers of these events as denote the commercial char acter of such attractions. Indeed, Corinth's crowds, made up of "Men, women, rich and poor," are explicitly diverse in the manner of a mass au dience. In its mixture of anonymity, recreation, public heterogeneity, and libidinal promise, night-time Corinth resembles the social ambience of a Vauxhall or a Couvent des Capucines, the site of the phantasmagoria and other attractions in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Paris.34 The flaring "lights" of the festivals might very well then be the centers of such attractions, which would imply another way to understand the shad ows cast by the strolling crowd. Like such lights the "moving shadows" thrown on walls throughout Corinth are those of the festivals, the moving projections of the phantasmagoria and other magic lantern shows. Their breaking out of the showmen's hall to cluster also around cornice, temple door, and colonnade would then proleptically allegorize a social condition with which we, and Debord, are very familiar: a world of spectacle, where human relations?economic, sexual, and ideological?are mediated by the omnipresent moving image. Indeed, both readings of the shadows mutually support each other, insofar as such projected images are the mass public's shadows; they are our desire literally embodied, or mediated, on a screen and given back to us, the fitting substance of the articulated "mutterings" of urban capital in, or as, a dream. Within and beyond Corinth the center of visual attention is Lamia. In deed, one way to order the notoriously wayward narrative of Keats's poem would be to consider the story a series of staged visual encounters with the titular character, a set of looks that then organizes all the other viewing occurring throughout the work. Hermes sees Lamia the creature; Lycius sees Lamia the natural woman; Corinth and the wedding guests see Lamia the social woman; and Apollonius (possibly along with Lycius) sees 34- "The 'Enclosure of the Capucines,' under the regime of the Directoire, became the meeting place of idlers, wanderers, prostitutes, and those in search of entertainment or a pleasant rendezvous. It was a cruel irony: under the Ancien Regime the convent had been noted for the austerity and extreme severity of its rite" (Mannoni 159).</page><page sequence="23">LAMIA AND CINEMATIC SENSATION 483 Lamia the creature. Much of the interpretive energy generated by Keats's work comes from adjudicating among all these different visions of Lamia. Hermes, for example, sees (and hears) a creature who claims to have been a woman while Apollonius sees a creature with no real prior history, as she really is and always will be, Lamia as das ding an sick. Keats's readers have tracked such interpretive choices back to the central question of whether to see Lamia as a creature or a woman, which in turn becomes the putatively more basic, and ontological, choice of whether she is a creature or a woman. This formulation, often assumed, is somewhat odd, given the fact that the creature is also gendered as a female. So the more precise ontological choice should be between Lamia as a creature or as a human. The reconception of this question as between creature and woman might then signify one rare instance in literature when woman, rather than man, signifies humanity. But as the feminine is distributed evenly among all the stages of viewing Lamia, as there is not only a "natural" woman outside Corinth (so natural that Lycius can only think that he is seeing a god) but also a female snake and a socialized woman (Lamia the bride), it becomes clear that woman does not signify human in any ontological sense. As Judith Butler and others have argued, the status of woman is not an ontological one.35 Neither is it for man, of course; it is woman however, that bears the brunt of this Apolloniusian insight, a truth that, as the patriarchal sage insists, must be monstrous and therefore exorcized. Apollonius' visual knowledge of Lamia is then supremely contradictory, insofar as he supposedly sees her as she really is, the thing-in-itself, but as such sees her as the truth of non-identity. To understand the full meaning of this antinomy means considering another possibility regarding Lamia's existence, that she is first and foremost an image. She is, more precisely, the epistemological question of visual sensation, of the reflected or projected image. No vision of Lamia, not that of Hermes, Lycius, the wedding guests, or Apollonius, has more ontological density than the others. As the replication of a series of conflicting images, Lamia constantly exists in a state of distortion, a radical version of the anamorphic principle found in different ways in Renaissance optical toys and the anamorphic lens of mod ern movie technology. Playing off Bruce Clarke's canny depiction of Lamia as the metamorphosis of metaphor, or metaphor for metamorphosis, we might say instead that Lamia is the anamorphosis of image, or image for anamorphosis.36 35- See Judith Butler, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (New York: Routledge, 1990). 36. Bruce Clarke, "Fabulous Monsters of Conscience: Anthropomorphosis in Keats's Lamia," SiR 23 (Winter 1984): 555-79.</page><page sequence="24">484 ORRIN N. C. WANG As in Clarke's meditation on Lamia's mutability, anamorphosis is intrin sically linked (in Lamia's case, perhaps fatally) to the anthropomorphic. As Clarke writes, "We have foresworn but not undone our animistic impulses: we have simply thrust them into sexual and economic relations, and then looked for gods in eros and capital (561). For Clarke the return to animism in Lamia takes place through figure; for W. J. T. Mitchell, however, the site of animism is best understood through the power, the attraction, of the im age.37 To make Clarke's observation about the animation of our sexual and economic relations one about the animated, moving image is to conceive of Lamia's world as Debord's, where the metaphysics of the image cannot be understood separately from its social character. The opening of Keats's poem, which catalogues the movement from an English faerie land to an ancient Greek world of myth, "before the faery brooks / Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods" (1.1-2), might then be understood as the juxtaposition of two different sets of animistic beings who embody Clarke's, and Debord's, social relations. This was the literal case for such creatures, who together made up one specific staple of projections for the phantasmagoria and other magic lantern shows. Within the context of the commercialized antiquity central to London's exhibitions, Greek mytho logical and English faerie characters were oftentimes part of the same commodified culture of supernatural visual entertainment. As Lamia sug gests they literally are the images, the phantasms of our desire, defined by political struggle and history. As such they mirror the phantasmagoria's other collection of favorite images. The magic lantern's Benjamin Franklin and Robespierre were historical, political figures who appeared as phan toms in the phantasmagoria seance; the dryads and elves in Lamia are phan toms who engage in history and politics. Oberon's "bright diadem" and "Sceptre" could then be taken reflexively, not simply as images of power, but as those of the social power that images wield, embody, and realize (1.3, 4). The social optics of Lamia are therefore not simply those of the theater. Certainly, as scholars have done with other pieces of romantic literature, one could profitably discuss the spectacle of Lamia's changing self-display through the performative dynamics of staged theater and related genres.38 37- See Mitchell, Picture Theory: The Last Dinosaur Book: the Life and Times of a Cultural Icon (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1998); and "The Last Formalist, or W.

Lamia is cinematic in a fundamen tal way that ties together classical, early, and much of pre-film history. The ater gives us images of social desire through the kinetic display of bodies; in contrast film embodies that desire through the kinetic image. In Lamia, and the cinema, the image precedes corporeality.39 As a moving image Lamia is also involved in a somatic animation vividly different from the static pictorialism of the fine arts. Through movement the image realizes an animistic state that expresses not only social desire but biological life itself. Late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century pre cinema was very much aware of these associations. Indeed, one of the first advertisements of the phantasmagoria in France also featured a display of galvanism, whose application, it was claimed, gave "temporary movements to bodies whose life [had] departed. "40 The dream of the living dead thing, the (re)animated object, is the dream of much romantic literature, from Wordsworth's "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal" to Kleist's Marionetten theater to Shelley's Frankenstein. It is also the dream of the living image, the attraction of much pre-cinema as well as the charm of Keats's sensational creature. Fittingly, Hermes and the reader become aware of Lamia's desire and kinetic potential at the same time. Her first words combine the two sides to her identity in a cry for transformative reanimation: "When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake! / When move in a sweet body fit for life, / And love, and pleasure and the ruddy strife / Of hearts and lips!" (1.38? 41), Hermes finds Lamia in snake-form, "palpitating . . . / Bright, and cirque-couchant" (1.45?46). Coiled in this manner, Lamia is literally wound tight; not quite still, she seems already to contain great energy, to be on the verge of apparent motion. The next well-known lines describe her in detail: applying theatrical principles to romantic literature, see Elizabeth A. Fay, A Feminist Introduc tion to Romanticism (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998) 188-235; and Susan Wolstenholme, Gothic (Re) Visions: Writing Women as Readers (Albany: State UP, 1993). Wolstenholme looks more at later nineteenth-century writers, but discusses the role of the tableau vivant in women's nov els. See also note 22. 39. Insofar as theater might deconstruct this opposition, film can be said to exist already in theatre. 40. Affiches, Annonces, et Avis Divers 121 (20 January, 1798) 2224; quoted in Mannoni 150.

C. WANG She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue, Vermillion-spotted, golden, green, and blue; Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard, Eyed like a peacock, and crimson barr'd; And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed, Dissolv'd, or brighter shone, or interwreathed Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries? So rainbow-sided, touch'd with miseries, She seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf, Some demon mistress, or the demon's self. (1.47-56) It is difficult not to read these lines meta-poetically, as Keats either cyni cally or defiantly giving the public "sensation of sort" in its most gaudily overwhelming visual form. The passage's perceptual and conceptual confu sion, its breathtaking clash of color and design, would then stand for a Cockney sensationalism brazenly resplendent in all its hyperbolic class col ors. The splendid gaucheness of such psychedelic intensity would then also account for the jarringly abrupt move toward interpreting the image's identity in the passage's last lines ("some penanced lady elf, / Some demon mistress, or the demon's self"), a seemingly incongruous literary mixing of the supernatural, gothic, and antiquity that actually reiterates the blended commercial product of the phantasmagoria and other lantern shows. Aside from its social resonance the passage's frenetic description also characterizes an image resistant to any static or frozen mode of being. Hermes and the reader look at Lamia and cannot quite see or capture her; apparently framed by the poem's narrative eye, she does not visually remain at rest.41 Such kinetic quality also speaks to the failure of the image to rise emphati cally out of the sensation of its description. The passage tries to do so through a series of similes that attempt to anchor Lamia's riotous visual qualities in a set of known animals ("zebra," "pard," and "peacock"). The conceptual result, however, is a hybrid zoo whose exotic exhibition fails to secure Lamia's image in any mentally synthetic manner. A hyperbolic ver sion of the zoo displays that Hunt would try to reform, Lamia remains a menagerie of different optic effects. As such she also depicts the wide array of public visual sensation of Keats's London milieu. 41. In that sense this passage seems to partake of a peculiar "Cockney sublime," an appro priately distorted version of the high romantic principle in Burke and Kant. Lamia is neither large nor distant; nor is she in shadow nor immediately dangerous in the manner of other forces of nature. She is entirely within Hermes' (and the reader's) frame of vision, which she does not disrupt. Seemingly well-proportioned she should be beautiful. Yet she is not. She cannot be quite seen and attempting to do so is far from pleasant, a dynamic that very much replays the Cockney stylistics derided and applauded by different readers of Keats.</page><page sequence="27">LAMIA AND CINEMATIC SENSATION 487 Lamia's description much more resembles the atomistic, paratactic dyna mism of Coleridgean fancy than any version of high romantic organic imagination that traditional readings habitually assume she represents. Like wise, the attempt to abstract from Lamia's visual presentation her identity as lady elf, demon's mistress, or demon clumsily falls short of its goal. Even as Keats's poem instills a reflexive structure in the scopic experience of Lamia's visual immediacy, her initial description paradoxically asserts that, at some basic level, she remains a visual sensation allergic to further conceptual hypostatization. Conversely, each portion of the poem's anamorphic sequence, each image of Lamia, is a dialectical attempt to chal lenge this constitutive opacity. The poem's first depiction of this sequence, Lamia's change from serpent being, emblematizes how anamorphosis, de sire, and visual kinetics converge in a flash of "phosphor and hot sparks" further signified by the somatic pain of transformation (1.152). Not coinci dentally, the two other moments of the anamorphic sequence, Lycius and Apollonius in different ways forcing Lamia to become the creature that they want, are also troped as forms of psychic, and then existential, pain. Tellingly, when Hermes first comes upon Lamia she is also associated with two specific forms of light: "full of silver moons ... as she breathed," she is "rainbow-sided" (1.51, 54), descriptions later reinforced by the much more remarked upon lines about Lamia as the "awful rainbow, once in heaven" undone by "Philosophy" (2.231, 234). Lamia is the product of an other source of light beside herself. She can be viewed, like the moon, be cause of the silvery reflection of light. Likewise, as a rainbow her colors are the refraction of light; they are the projection of light through one medium onto another?in the case of a rainbow, through rain onto the air; in the phantasmagoria, through glass lenses onto a wall, sheet, screen, or even smoke.42 If Lamia seems more than a still object, full of kinetic energy, she is also an image, constitutively an effect of either reflected or refracted light. As Paul Endo has observed, "The ear is a prominent opening for Lamia's magic?her singing enchants Lycius on a number of occasions, and music is the sole 'supportness' of her palace?but it is the eye that she exploits most skillfully."43 Endo's remark about the two senses could also extend to 42. The light source and lenses would be on one side of the screen, while the audience would be on the other. For a full description of how the phantasmagoria worked, see Mannoni 104-75; and Altick 217-20. The fact that the screen separated the phantasmagoria audience from the lantern contributed to the view of the show as occulting its optical tech niques; see note 60. 43. Paul Endo, "Seeing Romantically in Lamia," ELH 66 (1999): 115. Sound also works as a putative "reality" principle, as the "thrill / Of trumpets" (2.27-28) that incites Lycius to think about displaying Lamia in her wedded social form, much like the aural "bell" of the</page><page sequence="28">488 ORRIN N. C. WANG a familiar dynamic present in both theatre and pre-, early, and classical cin ema. Arguably, sound and image differ in their illusory properties only by degree. Sound can pretend that it is another sound: cymbals can be thun der, a recorded voice can be a live speaker, and extra-diegetic music can actually be diegetic. Through acoustic imitation sound can also ratify the psychic and physical illusion of space that the cinematic image especially presents. But, more radically, through its vibratory character sound can ac tively, like the image, present itself as another sense, most immediately that of a tactile presence. Through vibration sound can validate the illusion of motion and break the silence of the still frozen object. In the cinema, visual and audio sensation create the intelligibility of material sensuality, some thing that Lycius, staring at and listening to Lamia, very much buys. That said, paraphrasing Endo, it is the eye that the cinema exploits most skill fully. Insofar as we must argue for the self-evident role of sound in the cin ema, Lamia seems cinematic precisely to the degree that it recounts how sight appears most able to apprehend the real, and most likely to be in er ror.44 Supported by sound, sight signals the very phenomenon of sensory effect. The fact that the visual is a signal, however, also implies that it can be wrong, a predicament that Lycius at the end of the poem must face. Visuality, as many readers of Lamia have noted, is the very principle behind the coherent distinction between illusion and reality in Keats's poem. The epistemology of Lamia is the epistemology of the image. One might object that understanding Lamia as an image occludes one cru cial detail, the degree to which Lamia herselflooks upon Lycius with desire. Even one noticeable description of Lamia's putative interiority is con figured around her longing, telepathic vision of Lycius in Corinth ("She saw the young Corinthian Lycius / Charioting foremost in the envious race ..." [i. 16?17]). By participating in the relay of scopic desire, Lamia appears to be more than an image; she seems to gain the agency of an observer instead of simply remaining the observed. While this dynamic certainly has its own interpretive power, there is a radically different way to understand Lamia's specific scopic abilities, one that uncouples Lamia's look from any simple condition of intentional subjectivity or unproblematic agency. Lamia's look might instead be that of the Lacanian gaze, which is not, as is commonly assumed, about the subject's scopic desire; the gaze, as Slavoj word "forlorn" that tolls the poet back to his "sole self" in Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale" (Stillinger, John Keats 281). 44.

I am grateful to Celeste Langan for this refer ence.</page><page sequence="29">LAMIA AND CINEMATIC SENSATION 489 Zizek explains, is "not on the side of the looking . . . subject but on the side of what the subject sees."45 Keats literalizes this condition in Lamia through his physical description of her human eyes in her snake-form. Both highlighted and dislocated from the human face ("what could such eyes do there [on a serpent's head] . . ?" [1.61]), Lamia's eyes contain some thing beside the absolute, subjective intelligence of what she wants; literally rendered for us to see, they become partial objects in the Lacanian and Freudian sense, both blocking and enticing our comprehension of her de sire. Through the poem's objectification of her eyes, Lamia embodies the gaze, insofar as we do not so much inhabit the gaze as see the gaze looking, or not looking, at us. The gaze is more exactly this point of us not being seen; the looked upon gaze is therefore always mysterious, at some level al ways the sign of desire's unknowability, the degree to which desire always exceeds the Lacanian symbolic. The gaze is a stain or screen, the image of the impossibility of knowing what desire wants. Aside from her eyes, Lamia in her snake-form also has a human mouth. She is all eyes, all mouth, and, literally, as a serpent, all throat; she is all de sire, while exceeding our knowledge of that desire. Mouth and throat to gether also make voice, which along with the gaze is another prominent member of Lacan's list of partial objects that externalize for the subject the objet petit a, the object cause of desire. As such Lamia's features resonate with those of another mythological being who was actually showcased in the turn-of-the-century phantasmagoria: the Medusa, whose moving eyes and tongue visually foreground the gaze and voice (much like the later-in the-century image of fig. 4). Lamia's human seduction of Lycius depends on her gaze and voice precisely to the degree that whatever meaning her eyes and words convey to him is less important than the fact that she is looking at and speaking to him, that she is leveling her mysterious gaze and voice at him. Similarly, the Medusa is an exemplary reflection of the fright ening power of the phantasmagoria not simply because of what her mouth might have said or what the audience thought her eyes communicated, but because her features embody the phantasmagoria's ability to give living de sire, condensed in gaze and voice, to nothingness; to an object world "on the side of what the subject sees and hears."46 Their mythological sexual 45- Slavoj Zizek, "'I Hear You With My Eyes'; or the Invisible Master," in Gaze and Voice as Love Objects, eds.

WANG meaning distilled by the sensational media of Keats's poetry and the phan tasmagoria show, Lamia and Medusa act as complementary components of the same monstrous optics, mutual mirrorings of woman's double-bind as the allure and balefulness of desire's mysterious gaze.47 Indeed, as Lamia il lustrates, the patriarchal economy's terroristic response to the aporia of the objet petit a falls on woman; in Keats's poem the double-binds of this pre dicament are the same for Lamia as an image of woman and as a feminized image. The questions that Mitchell has asked of the image are the same that Keats's work asks of Lamia. What does she want? What does her gaze sig nify? In that sense, Lamia is Galperin's "return of the visible": "the 'familiar thing that has undergone repression' (to borrow from Freud), something that is no more forgotten than it is necessarily anterior."48 Lamia, then, gazes at Lycius; she is the image of gazing, or the gazing image. As Joan Copjec elucidates, "For everything that is displayed to the subject, the question is asked, 'What is being concealed from me?' The point at which something appears to be mvisible, this point at which some thing appears to be missing from representation, some meaning left unre vealed, is the point of the Lacanian gaze. It marks the absence of the signified. . . . "49 As Endo says, in a somewhat different context, Lamia also eroid boy in Steven Spielberg's film, A.I., whose gaze of loving desire unnerves both his bio logical mother/owner and the movie audience precisely to the degree that there is nothing be hind it; the desire of the young protagonist is that of an inanimate object, literally a filmic image. The power of the film lies in its splendid failure at resisting this knowledge, a narra tive schizophrenia that replays the dissonance between Spielberg and the film's original cre ator, Stanley Kubrick. Also pertinent would be Derrida's comment regarding the pharmakon of classical philosophy, how "Bewitchment (I'envoutment) is always the effect of a representa tion, pictorial or scriptural, capturing, captivating the form of the other, par excellence his face, countenance, word and look, mouth and eye, nose and ears: the vultus" (Dissemination, trans. Barbara Johnson [Chicago: U of Chicago P] 140). 47. Lamia's radical distortion would then also resonate with Lacan's more particular treat ment of anamorphosis as the "phallic ghost," a visual sign in dialectical relation with castration, the gaze, and the objet petit a (Lacan 88-89). As Lacan says of the objet petit a, "this serves as a symbol of the lack, that is to say, of the phallus, not as such, but insofar as it is lacking" (103). See likewise the discussion of Lamia as the "penised lady" in Clarke 576-77. See also note 61. 48. Mitchell, "What Do Pictures Really Want?" October 77 (Summer, 1996): 71-82; Galperin 3.

(Lacan 85). See also note 61. 49. Joan Copjec, Read My Desire: Lacan against the Historicists (Cambridge, MA: MIT P, 1994) 34.

WANG "accedes to her role [of being viewed] while holding a little in reserve?in other words, a secret. . ." (120). This is actually true in a radically constitu tive manner commensurate with Copjec's argument; Lycius and the reader see displayed in Lamia's gaze something wvisible. More prosaically put, what she sees in Lycius is never clear to us, or him. Does she want to be come human to love him or does loving him make her truly human? As Levinson argues, Lamia's desire is not even simply her own, insofar as her deal with Hermes regarding the nymph illustrates her collusion with a commodified libidinal economy from the start. But it is even more compli cated than that, since, as the commodified image of Cockney sensational ism, she embodies the innately mysterious desire, the mystifying desirabil ity, of the objectified commodity form. From such a perspective, Lamia becomes the objet petit a of a desire equally specific and vertiginous in its historicity, the commanding eros of a still nascent but feverishly expanding capitalist mass culture. If that culture's commodified image does indeed embody social desire, that desire's ultimate mystery installs within the social body a certain opaque density, the self-estrangement of the social optative that the com modity form historically evinces. Similarly, the resistance of the objet petit a to knowable desire does not necessarily have to be conceived in terms of something that exists in space before, after, or beyond that desire. More ex actly, as Slavoj Zizek outlines, the objet petit a can also be a certain constitu tive distortion within space itself, the Lamia-like sinuous curve that "causes us to make a bend precisely when we want to get at the object."50 The imagination of somatic desire in Lamia allegorizes the complex interplay between these two versions of the optative. When Hermes searches for the nymph her invisibility can stand for an immaterial, undefinable desire as yet to come into being, as yet to be given knowable, bodily form?the condi tion that Lamia the image tellingly grants. (We only have Lamia's word and the narrator's rumor of her that the nymph was once visible before that moment.) But if we take the nymph to be, in Copjec's phrase, mvisible, then the nymph as objet petit a is already embodied in the glens where she supposedly hides; her visual nothingness is something, the opacity of the symbolic in relation to itself.51 She is hidden in the same way that Lamia not mention the essay specifically, Copjec's thesis would affect the assumptions behind Laura Mulvey's well-known "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," in Visual and Other Pleasures (London: Macmillan, 1989) 14-26. But see also note 53. 50. Slavoj Zizek, Enjoy Your Symptom! Jacques Lacan in Hollywood and Out (New York: Routledge, 1992) 48-49. 51. Lacan's attendant notion of mimicry is also applicable here: "Mimicry reveals some thing insofar as it is distinct from what might be called an itself that is behind. The effect of</page><page sequence="33">LAMIA AND CINEMATIC SENSATION 493 the image has a radical secret; she is the secret that makes the desire of Lamia's own gaze mvisible. These contrasting accounts depict the tensions between a linear and more synchronic understanding of the coming-to-be of desire in the commodified image. Ultimately, Lamia seems unwilling to give a historically full, genetic ac count of commodified desire's opacity.52 The poem deflects such symbolic mastery by, as in the Hermes episode, its juxtaposition of a linear sense of desire's becoming with a more synchronic one. The idea of going back to a less mystified origin is given little credence by the poem, as the cul-de-sac of deciding Lamia's true ontological origins indicates?whatever Lamia's own explanation for her situation, the power of the work comes more from its sense of mythic repetition, the narration of a constitutive state of desire that Lamia exemplifies. Yet that same eschewing of the simply linear ensures the poem's understanding of desire as always material, always social. If the poem solely existed within a diachronic mode, its move from coun try to urban venue could be understood simply as the transformation of the lovers' natural desire into a socially commodified one. Lycius' sadism to ward Lamia would then be explained, as Endo has suggested, as one conse quence of the narrativization necessary for the social reification of his initial scopic desire, his later intent to have others see her publicly as his bride: "Let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar, / While through the thronged streets your bridal car / Wheels round its dazzling spokes" (2.62? 64).53 But, as Levinson has pointed out, Lamia's rural habitat is already marked by exchange and commodification, social activities emblematized by how the optative secret of the glens is carved out and congealed within the nymph's corporeal form. The moment is emblematic precisely because mimicry is camouflage, in the strictly technical sense. It is not a question of harmonizing with the background but, against a mottled background, of becoming mottled?exactly like the technique of camouflage practiced in human warfare" (Lacan 99). The nymph is invisible in that she is neither hidden by nor behind part of the visible country landscape; she is a mot tled stain on and of the landscape. 52. In line with Kaufman's argument about the Adornoesque quality of Keats's formalism, one might argue that the poem's resistance, or failure, to narrate itself beyond its own reification is precisely what incites the critical thought necessary to imagine a world beyond commodification (Kaufman 380-81). In Adorno this reification could refer to art's resistance to commodification, but also, as in the present essay, to its realization through the commod ity form. See Theodor Adorno, "The Schema of Mass Culture," in The Culture Industry: Se lected Essays on Mass Culture, ed. J. M. Bernstein (London: Routledge, 1991): 67. But see also notes 60 and 63. 53. Endo 118. Endo applies to Lycius' actions Mulvey's associations of voyeurism with linear time, and narrative with sadism: "Sadism demands a story, depends on making some thing happen, forcing a change in another person, a battle or will and strength, victory/ defeat" (Mulvey 21-22).</page><page sequence="34">494 ORRIN N. C. WANG the glens are not part of pure, untouched nature; they themselves already embody the secret of the nymph. In Lamia nature is already the process of hypostatization. The move from nature to city, from an unmediated, natu ral optics to a social one, is the poem's fundamental myth, its linear repeti tion of a socially material constant. In its reflexive disenchantment of that myth, Lamia portrays desire as always embodied socially; it is always radi cally mediated, as much as Keats's own irreducible, virtual sense of cultural experience. It is also unavoidably anamorphic, always opaque. Lamia de scribes the image as at once social and mvisible, a simultaneity analogous to the there-not-quite-there phantom materiality of the projections of the phantasmagoria. As Zizek might add, the opacity of such an image is also, dialectically, the very object cause of desire.54 The mystifying allure of Lamia is her, and our, mystery, our alien body and commodity form. Another name for this opacity is sensation, the unreflective immediacy of Lamia's sensory image. To know Lamia as a living being; to know her as something beside sensation; to extricate from commercialized sensation aesthetic elevation, scientific edification, or public instruction?all these are endeavors to realize social desire in a lucid, knowable form, to see in the exhibited image the constative clarity of what we want. The failure to abstract from optic sensation the narrative of social desire is also the porno graphic success of visuality as a pure, mindless attraction. If in Keats's time sensation named the set of social relations that a cultural work occupied, in Lamia those social relations are characterized as ultimately opaque. But, conversely, as a commodity visual sensation is already estranged from itself; it and its non-knowledge cannot simply be "pure." Likewise, the very du plicitous charm of the moving image, its representation of tactile presence, also makes the image at some unavoidable level an abstraction of sensation. The image is both sensation and abstraction, a predicament whose tensions are negotiated and, paradoxically, exacerbated by the literalized kinetics of the image's animism. As Gunning observes, the moving image in the magic lantern is an illu sion that the human eye can, with enough scrutiny, discern; in contrast, motion in film and later optic devices of the nineteenth century are some thing that the eye cannot physiologically see as a deception.55 Still, the ex ploration of visual sensation and its abstraction in Lamia suggests the shared social character of the dream of bodily movement in pre-, early, and later cinema. Cinematic narrative always exists in sensation as the potential lucid embodiment of social desire through the animistic image, or moving 54- Zizek, The Sublime Object of Ideology (London: Verso, 1989) 65. 55. Along with motion, the spatiality and very reality of the images of these later devices can not be detected as illusions by the eye (Tom Gunning, "Introduction," in Mannoni xxvi). Gunning refers to the discussion of optical toys in Crary's Techniques.</page><page sequence="35">LAMIA AND CINEMATIC SENSATION 495 figure?even if, as Jonathan Auerbach suggests of many early short films, the narrative arises out of pointless running and chasing.56 Conversely, cin ematic sensation always exists in narrative as the limit of that intelligibility, the kinetic diversion away from absolute comprehension of what seems to move before us. Insofar as this dialectic informs the pre-cinema?insofar as it informs Keats's oeuvre?they are already cinematic. But the dreaming of this dialectic in Keats's time is also specifically the dream of mass and elite audiences, public viewing, and the commodity form. The working out of this dialectic between sensation and abstraction in both its diachronic and synchronic modes is the interstice between cinematic history and capitalist modernity. Revising an earlier formulation, we should say that?in Keats, at least?the galvanic, biological reanimation of the romantic and cine matic dead object is social desire, animism as publicity, a mass public's act. If one concludes that imitators and masters of illusion will later be presented as charlatans and thamaturges?species of the genus pharmakeus?then once again ontological knowledge becomes a phar maceutical force opposed to another pharmaceutical force. Jacques Derrida, "Plato's Pharmacy" Apollonius' and Lycius' triangulated relationship with Lamia condenses much of these dynamics. We might first understand Lycius' relations to Lamia and to Apollonius as simply contrasting sensation with education, and Apollonius' actions as attempts to exorcize sensation from a Haber masian public sphere of bodily disinterest. But, as Levinson implies, and as the Greek overlay of the story allows, Apollonius' and Lycius' teacher student relation mixes pedagogy with libido, power, and affect; Apollonius' desire to teach Lycius visually what Lamia is could also be about teaching the young Corinthian who he is in relation to his stern master?a relation that Lycius replicates earlier in his sadistic treatment of Lamia.57 For Apollonius public education might already be colored by drives usually as sociated with the non-reflection of sensation. Similarly, as his name im plies, Lycius is associated with the lyceum, the site of higher learning. But the Lyceum in Keats's time is also the one located in London's Strand dis trict, a famous hall for many of the city's exhibitions and shows. Lycius himself embodies the contradictions between elite and mass culture and 56. For Auerbach the reflexivity of such early films comes from a "nostalgia for the auton omy of the single shot" and a resistance to the implied narrative of the films' "more dynamic linearity" (Auerbach 809-10). 57.

WANG pedagogy and entertainment; by forcibly socializing Lamia as his public bride, he also connects these contradictions to one between private and mass viewing. As important, these contradictions are equally about Lycius' relation to Apollonius as they are about the student and Lamia. But if Apollonius' and Lycius' (initially) separate visions of Lamia medi ate their conflicted relation to one another, the coherence of that media tion is further complicated by an aspect of the sophist's identity that con verges with the history of the phantasmagoria. One of the most influential practitioners of this sophisticated magic lantern show was Etienne-Gaspard Robertson, "who opened his 'Fantasmagorie' in Paris in 1798" (Mannoni 147). A physicist and chemist, Robertson first conceived of the phantasma goria in explicitly educational terms: The Bureau Central has authorized me to give a class in Phantasmago ria, a science which deals with all the physical methods which have been misused in all ages and by all peoples to create belief in the resur rection and apparition of the dead. The Government protects this es tablishment: it has recognized the need to encourage the physicist philosopher, whose works and morality tend to destroy the enchanted world which only owes its existence to the wand of fanaticism.58 Robertson's vision squares with much of the self-representations of indi viduals involved in the phantasmagoria, and it fits Apollonius as well; in his stare we see the disenchanting instruction of the magic lantern's "physicist philosopher." He is the Apollonian sun to Lamia's moon; both the source of her projected light and the searching rational inquiry that shows her to be simply an image and nothing more. Robertson's deliberate rhetoric against "fanaticism" and his reference to France's revolutionary govern ment also constitute something beside a coincidence. They point to the same identity for Apollonius that Paul Philodor, the likely inventor of the phantasmagoria, also advertised, when, using the "philosophical ideas of the Enlightenment and Revolution [he] claimed to be debunking popular credulity towards sorcerers, prophets, visionaries, exorcists and other charlatans (including priests, monks, and popes)" (Mannoni 143). The physicist-philosopher's science of images is also the dream of a science of ideology, a term whose own complicated history likewise begins in revolu tionary and Napoleonic France.59 Apollonius unmasks Lamia as an image, 58.

But, of course, a dream of a science is still a dream, which is very much Lamia's realm. Likewise, Mannoni notes how Philodor's Revolutionary iconoclasm "exploited the public's taste for the occult" and, even more un ambiguously, a committee investigating Robertson's patented right to the name Fantasmagorie described his practice as the making of optical illusions "which, without advancing by a single step or making any progress in the pursuit of the sciences, serve[d] only to capture the admiration and above all the money of the Public, to whom [he and his rival were] careful not to explain the causes."60 As critiques of ideology from both the left and the right have opined since the Revolution, the ideological scientist might be the biggest charlatan of all. The "physicist-philosopher" is also a priest, a vocation that Robertson trained for in his youth. Apollonius' scopic pos session of Lamia the image is a science marked by jealousy, suspicion, guarded authority, and its own optics of mystification, a condition literalized in the phantasmagoria by its back projection, which hid the lan tern from the audience's view. Himself irreducibly defined by such optics, Apollonius, like the priest and capitalist London showman, can also never absolutely know himself, his science, or his desire. ford UP, 1977) 56-59.

For an account of the patent battle between Robertson and Leonard Andre Clisorius, which tells much about the contradictory represen tations of the phantasmagoria as both secretive magic and open science, see Mannoni 165 73. The association of the phantasmagoria with the secretive occultation of its own principles continued into the twentieth century with Adorno's use of the term as a figure for the mystification of the production process: the phantasmagoria is the "point at which aesthetic appearance becomes a function of the character of the commodity. As a commodity it pur veys illusion. The absolute reality of the unreal is nothing but the reality of a phenomenon that not only strives unceasingly to spirit away its own origins in human labor, but also, in separably from this process and in thrall to exchange value, assiduously emphasizes its use value, stressing that this is its authentic reality, that it is 'no imitation'" (Theodor Adorno, In Search of Wagner, trans. Rodney Livingstone [London: Verso, 1981] 261). See Crary for a dis cussion of how in the 1830s the stereoscope individualized the epistemological secrecy of the phantasmagoria for separate viewers, "transforming each observer into simultaneously the magician and deceived" (Crary, Techniques 133).

WANG Many have noticed the resemblance between Apollonius and Lamia; more precisely, the two antagonists mirror each other but are not the same.61 Lamia begins in the poem as a snake with human eyes while Apollonius has a petrifying, serpentine stare ("lashless eyelids stretch / Around his demon eyes!") and a human form (2.288-89). This and other traits (his vampiric intrusion into the lovers' domicile) make him a male version of Geraldine from Coleridge's Christabel, a famously incomplete piece of gothic sensation that shares many of the obsessions and themes of Keats's poem. Yet Apollonius' monstrousness both converges with and ex ceeds Lamia's, as well as Geraldine's and Medusa's, two more explicit pos sessors of the female evil eye. Like them he is a monster in both the Lacanian and Derridean sense, insofar as his desire also remains ultimately opaque, (terrifyingly) unknowable in any (phallic) representation. He might look at Lamia in a certain way to regain Lycius, but he might do so also to kill the young student. With his scopic control he might be either exorcizing or possessing Lamia. He might kill Lycius in order to possess Lamia; he might possess Lamia in order to kill Lycius. We cannot tell if he looks upon Lamia as a teacher, physicist, ideological critic, magician, huck ster, or pornographer. He himself might very well just be another image, a parody of Apollo or one of the "Theosophers" also called up by the phan tasmagoria's seance. But he is also a monster simply in his ability to make Lamia pay for being an image?for the opacity of social desire, and social relations, embodied in both of them. His patriarchal stare might really be either Lamia's feminine gaze or Medusa's castrating evil eye, but it is also the terroristic enforcement of the difference between them and him. Apollonius and Lamia might be the same but their stories are not, which is what constitutes, and what counts in, social antagonism. Whether Lycius ultimately sees Lamia the way that Apollonius does is, of 6i. See, for example, Daniel P. Watkins, Keats's Poetry and the Politics of the Imagination (Rutherford: Farleigh Dickinson UP, 1989) 147. More germane to the present study is the relation between gaze and "evil eye" discussed in Lacan 115-19. Lacan narrates a distinction (and similitude) applicable to Lamia and Apollonius, a division that the poem also temporalizes through its progression from nature to Corinthian civilization: "For it is insofar as all human desire is based on castration that the eye assumes its virulent, aggressive function, and not simply its luring function as in nature" (Lacan 118). But it could also be argued that the commodity form in Lamia collapses this allegorized distinction between the natural and commodified realms, making the visual dialectic between Lamia as lure and Apollonius as predator the synchronic condition of capitalist modernity, rather than the diachronic pro gression of modernity out of nature. More precisely, Apollonius' aggressive optics would be patriarchy's own awareness of the baleful effects of the commodity form, the phallic suspi cion that every Lamia might actually be a Medusa, a living thing whose lure turns men into (castrated) things?an aggressive, visual logic that patriarchy's suspicions can only compul sively anticipate and repeat.</page><page sequence="39">LAMIA AND CINEMATIC SENSATION 499 course, an open question. This quandary is even more prosaic than won dering what it might mean to see Lamia as a snake. The predicament is generated by how the last lines of Keats's poem energetically confuse their pronouns. Burton's Anatomy would suggest that "'A serpent!' echoed he" refers to Apollonius repeating himself (2.305); as Mark Jones observes, however, "he," could just as well refer to Lycius finally seeing Lamia through Apollonius' eyes, an epistemological event that then arguably in cites her disappearance and his death (see note 38). Similarly, the descrip tive action of Lycius' death, which coincides with the end of the poem, is by no means clear: And Lycius' arms were empty of delight, As were his limbs of life, from that same night. On the high couch he lay!?his friends came round? Supported him?no pulse, or breath they found, And, in its marriage robe, the heavy body wound. (2.307-11) In his death Lycius might now be the "it" of the "heavy body," now finally as inanimate as the image he loved. Or "it" might refer to Lamia the crea ture, either living or dead, now wound or coiled in the marriage robe after Lamia's human form has "vanished." This indeterminancy could speak to an Apolloniusian perspective in which the non-human is always a type of death. But if the heavy body is Lycius, the marriage robe wrapped by that form could also be Lamia's. More precisely, the robe could be Lamia, the screen or sheet upon which the optic illusion of her tactile form and inner self was projected. The robe is literally one side to Lamia, the reflexive, material remainder left over by her abrupt, emphatic vanishing, the disen chantment of visual sensation by Lamia that dialectically informs the in creasingly visual mediality of early nineteenth-century England. But is disenchantment only Apolloniusian, and is it simply fatal? Chan dler, in his own discussion of the poetry of sensation, quotes from Oskar Negt's and Alexander Kluge's proletariat complication of Habermas' narra tive of one public sphere, what occurs when a laborer's fantasy meets alien ated reality: As fantasies move further away from the reality of the production pro cess, the goal that drives them on becomes less sensitive. Therefore, all escapist forms of fantasy production tend, once they have reached a certain distance from reality, to turn around and face up to real situa tions.62 62. Oscar Negt and Alexander Kluge, Public Sphere and Experience: Toward an Analysis of the Bourgeois and Proletariat Public Sphere, trans. Peter Labanyi, Jamie Oswen Daniel, and</page><page sequence="40">500 ORRIN N. C. WANG Obsessed with the compulsions of the commodity form, the Corinthian cir cuit of exchange, commerce, and consumption, Lamia seems less sanguine about the possibility of facing the "reality" of the production process.63 Nevertheless, by its very animistic nature, the commodity form advertises its inanimate status, the unavoidable moment when its fantasy confronts something besides itself. This might not be reality (as Zizek might say that was the fantasy), but it might also not be biological death (Sublime Object 30?49). Lamia's vanishing could also be the end of a show, the conclusion to an attraction or sensation when the mass audience gets up from their seats as lights replace the darkness. It could be the series of disjunctures in herent in our optic mediations of the world, what we know today as much by the push of a button or click of a mouse. If, at the end of the poem, as many suggest, Lamia returns to the country and Apollonius to his study to await another cycle of their (apparently) eternal story, we might ask, re gardless of the narrator's explicit claims, whether Lycius, the public subject of proto-, not simply pre-, cinema, also awakens from his nerveless state and exits the exhibition hall, to await once more the consequences of Her mes' stolen light, the chance to see desire in nothing, the mvisible in the image, the always social self in projected, kinetic form. We are all Keats's heirs in that we experience culture, both high and low, as constituted by different degrees of virtuality. We all like Lycius inhabit the fatal moment of inter-medial discontinuity, the conscious, material limit of any one social representation, of any one resolution to the captivating, worrisome dialec tic between visual sensation and its abstraction. Whether that parataxis is a moment of freedom or quotidian repetition, whether it suggests the possi bility of oppositional practice or the symptom of co-optation, are alterna tives perhaps indeterminate as the meanings of death. But, as Lamia sensa tionally anticipates, this discontinuity is more than ever our public life. University of Maryland Assenka Oskiloff (Minneapolis and London: U of Minnesota P, 1992) 36; quoted in Chan dler, "Poetry of Sensation" 535. 63. Levinson refers to Apollonius, Lamia, and Corinth as agencies who are "producers of material" (282). But she also refers to their shared abilities as forms of magic; to the degree that labor in the poem is magic?seemingly effortless and almost immediate, at least for the agent?Lamia bars or demurs further inquiry into any story of production that might exist before the poem's experience of itself as a commodified image.
