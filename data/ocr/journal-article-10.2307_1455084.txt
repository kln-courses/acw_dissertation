<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, LXXXIV, No. 4 (April, 1994) 417-444 THE SADDUCEES AND THE WATER LIBATION JEFFREY RUBENSTEIN, New York University ABSTRACT The consensus of scholarship believes that the Sadducees rejected the legitimacy of the Sukkot water libations. This conclusion is based on two principal arguments. The first argument rests on rabbinic traditions which supposedly state that the Sadducees opposed the libation. The second argument is based on the assumption that the Sadducees rejected "the Oral Law" which provided the authority for the ritual. Neither of these arguments stands up to criticism. Rabbinic sources nowhere state that the Sadducees rejected the libation. New evidence from Qumran, together with more methodologically aware analyses of rabbinic texts, have revised the general conception of the Sadducees and their approach to law. The libation controversy must therefore be explained on other grounds. Two possible explanations are proposed. The controversy may have derived from a dispute concerning the place upon the altar where libations should be poured. It is also possible that the controversy centered on the legitimacy of bringing the water libations on the Sabbath and not on the legitimacy of the libation per se. Did the Sadducees reject the ritual of the water libation? The con- sensus of scholarship believes so.' This conclusion is based on two principal arguments, although it is now taken for granted to such an extent that few scholars bother to adduce evidence for the claim. The first argument appeals to rabbinic traditions which supposedly state that the Sadducees opposed the libation. The second argument derives from ideas concerning the general Sadducean approach to law. In a syllogistic manner this latter argument runs as follows: the 1 The Rishonim already make this claim; see Ritba to bSuk 48a (ed. A.

Rabbinic sources nowhere state that the Sadducees rejected the libation. And new evidence from Qumran, together with more methodologically aware analyses of rabbinic texts, have revised the general conception of the Sadducees and their approach to law. Yaakov Sussman's analysis of Miqsat Ma'aseh ha-Torah (MMT), the recently published letter from Qumran,3 reveals that the halakhic tradition of this document follows Sadducean law, and confirms Joseph Baumgarten's discov- ery that the halakhot of the Qumran scrolls tend to cohere with po- [1857]) 3:139-141; J.

Of those listed in the previous note only Urbach eschews these two arguments and suggests that "the motive for the opposition to the water libation is not clear, but it is possible that it reflects the repugnance felt by the more aristo- cratic elements of the priesthood at the popular and public aspects of the ceremony" (op cit.). 3 Y.

The first two sections of this essay demonstrate that the sources typically cited as proof that the Sadducees rejected the libation do not justify this conclusion, and argue that there is no other reason to believe that the Sadducees denied the legitimacy of the libation. The third and fourth sections propose two alternative hypotheses to explain the rabbinic traditions concerning a libation controversy.

R.

S. Lieberman (New York, 1961), pp. 270-27 1. 8 tPar 3.8: The Sadduceean priest waited until sunset before performing the rit- ual of the red heifer, and thus contravened the Pharisaic halakhah; see mPar 3.7-8. S. Lieberman (Tosefta Kifshuta [= TK] [New York, 1955-1988] 4:731) explains that "three days" mentioned in tPar 3.8 (see next note) is not to be taken literally, but means "a short time," and thus avoids a contradiction between the Palestinian Tal- mud and the Tosefta. It seems more likely that PT had a different version of the baraita. The allusion to a tractate by name is rare, but that must be the meaning and not "the [priest who is mentioned in connection with] the red cow." The second cul- prit is referred to as "he of Sukkah" which can only be the tractate, for his derivation had nothing to do with a booth but with the water libation. For other examples of the names of tractates mentioned in rabbinic sources, see J. N. Epstein, Mavo' le-Nusah ha-Mishnah (Tel Aviv, 19642), pp. 989-991. 9 tYom 1.8: The high priest offered the incense outside the Holy of Holies, against the rabbinic law. According to the Tosefta, he died three days later. 10 Parallel in yYom 1.5, 39a. Whether all three are one and the same person de- pends on how the priest in Yoma died. According to one tradition he died within the Holy of Holies, and thus obviously did not live until Sukkot. According to another tradition he died "shortly thereafter." He survived until Sukkot, refused to perform the libation correctly, was pelted with citrons and died.</page><page sequence="5">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 421 The Mishnah rules that the priest must be told "Raise your hand," and then explains the reason for this directive. It is to prevent him from pouring the water at his feet as a certain priest once did. The Mishnah does not assert that the priest was a Sadducee/Boethusian. 1 1 Based on the Mishnah alone there is no reason to suppose that a sectarian controversy is at issue. Nor is his motivation for pouring the libation at his feet recorded. The priest may have considered this to be the correct manner of performing the libation. Or he may have thought that in general libations should be placed on the altar,12 but that this particular libation should not. The Tosefta begins with the clause "since. . . ," a formulation which indicates that the baraita comments on the Mishnah.13 The passage is a later explanation of the Mishnah, not an independent version of the event. The Tosefta interprets the Mishnah in terms of a sectarian controversy by asserting that the priest who poured the libation at his feet was a Boethusian. Again, the motivation of the priest is unclear. It is not stated that he attempted to avoid perform- ing the libation in its proper manner, nor that he rejected the rite in toto. Note that the Tosefta supplies additional information about the consequences of the flying citrons. They so damaged the altar that sacrifices were suspended until the horn could be repaired. The account of such repercussions introduces both a legendary and a polemical element to the passage: when Boethusian priests do not act in accordance with rabbinic law, calamities ensue.14 1 This was pointed out by G. Holscher (Der Sadduzaismus: Eine Kritische Un- tersuchung zur spateren jiidischen Religionsgeschichte [Leipzig, 1906], p. 60), and was actually sensed already by Abraham Geiger (Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel in Ihrer Abhdngigkeit von der Innern Entwicklung des Judentums [Breslau, 1857], p. 136, n 3). The context of both scholars is the association of the Sadducees with the High Priesthood. On Boethusian, see below. Lieberman (TK 4:870) and Sussmann (MMT, pp. 41-42) point out that the better manuscripts of tannaitic sources read bet sin or betsin but never betusi (= Boethusian). I use "Boethusian" simply because this variant has become the standard English spelling. 12 Or into the designated bowl perched upon the altar; mSuk 4.8. 13 Lieberman, Tosefta Moced, p. 270, note to line 63; and TK 4:881. A similar phenomenon appears in mYom 1.5 and tYom 1.8. The Mishnah does not mention sectarians by name. Yet the Tosefta comments, "since already it happened that a cer- tain Boethusian . . . ," utilizing the same introductory formula. 14 S. Cohen ("Parallel Historical Tradition in Josephus and Rabbinic Literature," Proceedings of the Ninth World Congress of Jewish Studies, 1985 [Jerusalem, 1986], vol. B/1, p. 12) observes that in the Tosefta "the story becomes part of a cycle designed to show that the Sadducees, although they disagree with the rabbis, must nevertheless obey them" (yYoma 1.5, 39a).</page><page sequence="6">422 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The baraita in BT is essentially identical to the Tosefta. 5 The main difference is the designation of the priest as a Sadducee, not a Boethusian. This interchange occurs often between the Tosefta and parallel sources: the Tosefta consistently reads "Boethusian" while the Mishnah, Talmuds, and halakhic Midrashim read "Sad- ducee." 16 While this phenomenon has yet to be satisfactorily ex- plained, at least our case is not exceptional.17 Although the BT baraita does not begin with the relative clause, as does the Tosefta, it is clear that the Tosefta is BT's source. Only the first two words, OPn01 n3wv ("since it already happened.. ."), have been omitted. PT does not cite the baraita nor mention explicitly the Saddu- cees or the Boethusians.18 But it clearly interprets the Mishnah as a sectarian controversy, for it groups the priest "of [Tosefta] Suk- kah" with the priests of "Parah" and "Kippurim." These priests are the Sadduceans mentioned in tYom 1.8 and tPar 3.8 who did not act in accordance with rabbinic law. PT asks whether the same priest perpetrated these violations of law or whether two different priests were responsible. Thus PT groups the Mishnah's tradition with other cases when Sadducean (high?19) priests disobeyed the Pharisaic/rabbinic20 law.21 The legendary and polemical thrusts 15 See R. Rabbinovicz, Diqduqe Soferim: Variae Lectiones in Mischnam et in Talmud Babylonicum (Reprint; New York, 1960), ad loc., n. n for minor variants, none of which affect our discussion. 16 See Sussmann, MMT, pp. 48-49, n 166 for a list of examples, and pp. 42-43, nn 139-40; 44-45, n 147; 48-52 and n 171. The Mishnah only mentions Boethu- sians once, mMen 10.3. The Tosefta mentions Boethusians in six contexts and Sad- ducees but thrice, two of which are citations from the Mishnah. 17 Sussmann (MMT, p. 49, n 166) suggests that "the source of the interchanges between Sadducee/Boethusian in parallel sources apparently derives from one branch of tannaitic tradition, apparently a relatively late tradition, and its tendency reached amoraic literature in a few cases." 18 PT does cite the latter part of the baraita about the damage to the altar. This, and the fact that PT follows the Tosefta in assuming the priest was a Sadducean (Boethu- sian in Tosefta), suggests that it knew the entire baraita. Lieberman has noted that at times PT cites only part of a baraita, yet the discussion pertains to the part not cited. 19 The priest of tPar 3.8 is addressed by R. Yohanan b. Zakkai as "My Lord, High Priest." The priests in tSuk, bSuk, and yYoma appear to be regular priests. But since PT considers that they could all be the same priest, it must conceive of the Sukkah and Yoma priests as high priests. See too Le Moyne, Sadduce'eans, 286, n 8. 20 I do not mean to identify the Pharisees and the Rabbis, but only to indicate that the Rabbis generally followed Pharisaic traditions. On this topic see S. Cohen, "The Significance of Yavneh: Pharisees, Rabbis, and the End of Sectarianism," HUCA 55 (1984): 36-42, 51-53. 21 See the previous note. Cohen (Parallel Historical Tradition, p. 11) compares rabbinic historiography to "the portrait of 'popular historiography' drawn by Hip-</page><page sequence="7">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 423 are even more pronounced than in the Tosefta. According to PT, the temple courtyard screamed "Begone from here! Begone from here!" and the priest was killed.22 When rabbinic law is violated, disaster results. From this brief analysis it is clear that no rabbinic source claims that the Sadducees/Boethusians rejected the water libation. The most we can conclude is that the Sadducean priest disagreed as to how the libation was to be performed or when it was to be done. It should also be noted that the Mishnah, the oldest source, does not mention sectarians at all. That the priest was a Boethusian/Sadducee is how the Tosefta, and the Talmuds in its footsteps, interpreted the Mishnah. In this case the Tosefta most likely comments on the Mishnah; it does not seem to have preserved an independent tradi- tion from temple times. Accordingly, the Toseftan passage probably post-dates the redaction of the Mishnah, over 130 years after the de- struction of the temple and the cessation of the libation. The histori- cal accuracy of its interpretation is suspect. Even the historicity of the mishnaic tradition itself deserves to be scrutinized with caution. I do not mean to adopt a position of radi- cal skepticism, so increasingly common these days, that rejects all rabbinic traditions about temple times and asserts that they are by definition late, unverifiable, and unreliable. In our case, however, the tradition bears an uncanny resemblance to the accounts in Josephus where Alexander Jannaeus is pelted with citrons (AJ 13.372). A comprehensive study of the relationship between the rabbinic and the Josephan traditions is beyond the scope of this study and would require full consideration of all parallel stories.23 Still, one must wonder whether the Rabbis adapted a popular Jo- sephan tale for their own purposes. This does not deny that the Rab- bis recalled a dispute over some aspect of how the libation was to polyte Delehaye in his The Legends of the Saints (English translation, 1962): There is a fundamental lack of concern for chronological exactitude. Stories and sayings cluster around a small number of archetypal heroes who absorb the material of lesser figures.... Just as the midrash declares that Ibzan and Boaz are one and the same, that Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerses are one and the same, the rabbis declare that Yan- nai the King and Yohanan the High Priest are one and the same (bBer 29a). Even when they do not explicitly state that they are creating composite figures, they are doing so." Here PT considers whether the three Sadducean (high) priests are one and the same person. 22 The dead priest and the damaged horn led some commentators to suggest that the people threw stones as well as citrons. See TK 4:880-881 and the references cited there. 23 For some preliminary work, see Cohen, Parallel Historical Tradition, pp. 7-14.</page><page sequence="8">424 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW be performed. But it raises the possibility that a minor, rather tech- nical, disagreement, no different from any other of the myriad mishnaic disputes, was read into the Josephan story (or a popular- ized version of that account) and became exaggerated through the addition of the legendary trope of citron pelting.24 Subsequently the matter was understood in far more serious terms. Later rabbinic sources introduce legendary motifs which embellish the unfortu- nate results of the outrage provoked by the renegade priest. Medi- eval and modern scholars, for their part, understood that such a serious reaction of the people stemmed from the elemental nature of the dispute-the Sadducean rejection of ancient nonscriptural tradition.25 I. The Sadducees and the Oral Law The second reason why scholars claim that the Sadducees re- jected the libation is that they rejected "the Oral Law," that is to say, laws not explicitly stated in the Torah. Since the libation falls into 24 G. Allon ("The Attitude of the Pharisees," Jews, Judaism, and the Classical World, trans. I. Abrahams [Jerusalem, 1977], p. 33, n 34) argues that the stories in Jo- sephus and rabbinic tradition do not refer to the same incident. He explains the com- mon trope of citron-pelting by suggesting "that it was a daily occurrence for the people to pelt with citrons anyone whom they wished to insult." He cites as evidence the in- cident of bQid 73a, where the citizens of Mahoza pelted R. Zeira with citrons because they felt insulted by his homily (MS Munich has Rava, and Vatican 111 has R. Ye- huda). Another example appears in the midrash found in Tanhuma Qedoshim ?8; ed. Buber 3:77 (in three MSS; see Buber's n 43); and Yalqut Shimconi, Qedoshim ?616. The midrash tells of a man who brought dates and apples to Hadrian hoping to receive a reward, but the emperor ordered his soldiers to slap the man's face with them. He re- turns home and tells his wife to be thankful that he did not bring citrons, for in that case they would surely have pelted his face and entire body with them. This tale seems to assume that pelting with citrons was a standard expression of disgust. (However, it is possible that the tale adopted the citron-pelting motif from the Mishnah.) 25 It has been universally assumed that the priest only rejected the water libation. What was his attitude to the wine libation? Did he perform this libation correctly, but object to performing the water libation? Although wine libations routinely accompa- nied sacrifices (Exod 29:40; Lev 23:13, 18, 37; Num 28:7-29:38; 15:5, 7, 10, 24; 6:15, 17), the Sukkot wine libation appears to have been of special importance, and was poured together with the water libation. The Mishnah does not specify which li- bation the priest poured on the ground. While the preceding sections of the Mishnah describe the water libation and its procession, the subject shifts to both libations in the rulings immediately preceding the account of the recalcitrant priest. The actual clause describing the deviate libation refers to the priest, ltvm5i, "to the one pouring," not to the type of libation. It is possible, then, that (according to rabbinic sources) the priest poured the wine libation at his feet, or more likely, both libations.</page><page sequence="9">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 425 that category, the Sadducees supposedly rejected it. This argument is very problematic. First, the Sadducees clearly possessed an in- terpretive tradition of their own, one that differed from Pharisaic/ Rabbinic halakhah on many points, but nonetheless included an- cient "traditions."26 The Sadducees were by no means dogmatic lit- eralists.27 This point emerges from Yaakov Sussmann's recent analysis of MMT. Sussmann demonstrates that the halakhic pre- scriptions of MMT agree with the positions ascribed to the Sad- ducees in rabbinic texts,28 a conclusion recently confirmed by L. Schiffman.29 The halakhic tradition of the authors of MMT, and probably the origin of the sect, derived from the Sadducees. Suss- mann argues that separatist sects waged a two-sided struggle: a social, theological, and ethical battle with the Sadducees over their aristocratic tendencies, and a halakhic-theological conflict with the Pharisees and their legal innovations.30 On this basis Sussmann sub- stantiates the speculations of many scholars that the "Boethusians" 26 See A. Saldarini, Pharisees, Scribes, and Sadducees in Palestinian Society(Wilm- ington, DE, 1988), pp. 231, 301-303; Le Moyne, Les Sadduceeans, pp. 378-379. 27 Of course the idea of "literal meaning" or "simple meaning" is now considered problematic. 28 MMT, pp. 27-36. See also the remarks of Qimron and Strugnell ("Unpublished Halakhic Letter," pp. 400-407) and L. Schiffman ("The New Halakhic Letter [4QMMT] and the Origins of the Dead Sea Sect," BA 53 [1990]: 64-73). The affinity between Qumran and Sadducean halakhah was first pointed out by Joseph Baumgar- ten ("The Pharisaic-Sadducean Controversies") and see now Baumgarten, "Recent Qumran Discoveries and Halakah in the Hellenistic-Roman Period" in Jewish Civili- zation in the Hellenistic-Roman Period, ed. S. Talmon (Sheffield, 1988), pp. 151-153 where he proposes that "the Qumranites are another sort of sidwqym.... The possi- bility that in rabbinic sources the name seduqim served as an epithet not only for the aristocratic Sadducees but also for the adherents of the Qumran sect, is indeed worthy of serious consideration.") Actually the identification of the Sadducees with the Qumran sect had been proposed previously. See C. Rabin, "Alexander Jannaeus and the Pharisees," JJS 7 (1956): 5. Other scholars had identified Schechter's Zadokite Fragments with the Sadducees. See R. Leszynsky, Die Sadduzaer, pp. 142-167 and R. H. Charles, "The Zadoqite Fragments," The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament (Oxford, 1913) 2:785. Charles suggests that the authors of the work broke away from the Sadducees; they were "reformed Sadducees." 29 L. Schiffman, "The Temple Scroll and the Systems of Jewish Law of the Second Temple Period" in Temple Scroll Studies, ed. G. J. Brooke (Sheffield, 1989),'pp. 250- 253. Schiffman concludes: "In four out of the five Pharisee-Sadducee debates reported in m. Yad. 4, the author of MMT takes the view of the Sadducees, and polemicizes against the view ascribed in tannaitic sources to the Pharisees." J. Strugnell ("The Qumran Scrolls: A Report on Work in Progress," Jewish Civilization in the Hellenis- tic-Roman Period, p. 99) suggests that MMT "was written to defend halakhot that we usually call 'Sadducaean,' or to oppose halakhot that we usually call Pharisaic." 30 Sussman, MMT, p. 48.</page><page sequence="10">426 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of rabbinic sources (who are often interchanged with the Saddu- cees),31 should be identified with the Essenes (Boethusian = baitusin = beit sin = House of [Es]sene).32 The upshot is that MMT and pre- sumably the other Qumran texts provide insight into Sadducean law and Sadducean legal thought, even if some differences are to be ex- pected.33 Now MMT and its rulings are certainly more strict than Rabbinic halakhah, but are not consistently "closer" to biblical law. So too the Temple Scroll and other Qumran texts are replete with laws not found in Scripture.34 Other laws in the Temple Scroll ap- pear to be based on complex exegeses.35 Sussmann concludes: The common opinion in scholarly literature, based on Josephus, on one hand, and on the scholion to Megillat Ta'anit, on the other, that the essential disagreement between the Pharisees and 31 See above, n. 16. 32 Sussman, MMT, pp. 54-60. Azariah de Rossi first made this conjecture, and many followed after him. See the references in Sussmann, pp. 54-55 and Le Moyne, Sadduce'eans, p. 338, nn 8-11. 33 Further work is needed on this point, but already there appears to be agreement between the Temple Scroll, MMT and Sadducean traditions preserved in Rabbinic literature. See Baumgarten, "The Pharisaic-Sadducean Controversies," and L. Schiff- man, "Systems of Jewish Law," pp. 245-253. Baumgarten provides additional ex- amples in "Polemics in New Fragments from Qumran Cave 4," Biblical Archaeology Today, ed. J. Amitai (Jerusalem, 1985), pp. 391-397. See too Sussmann, MMT, pp. 58-60, and B. Z. Wacholder, The Dawn of Qumran (Cincinnati, 1983), pp. 160- 167. Although Schiffman shows that the laws of MMT and the Temple Scroll are not in complete agreement, he observes that the disagreements are "minor." On the other hand, Hans Burgmann ("1 1QT: The Sadducean Torah," Temple Scroll Studies [above, n 29], pp. 258-271) argues that the Temple Scroll was written by Sadducees and served as their Torah, and M. R. Lehmann ("The Beautiful War Bride [fNn nm] and other Halakhot in the Temple Scroll," Temple Scroll Studies, p. 266) also believes that the Temple Scroll contains a body of Sadducean halakhot. 34 E.g., the Feast of Wood Offering (cols. 23-25) and the Feasts of the First Fruits of Wine and Oil (cols. 19-23). The nonscriptural origin of several laws of the Temple Scroll was noted by M. R. Lehman, "The Temple Scroll as a Source of Sectarian Halakhah," RevQ 9 (1977-78): 582. Particularly telling is Louis Ginzberg's anal- ysis of Schechter's "Zadokite Documents." Ginzberg noted that the texts repeatedly extend the law beyond biblical law and contain what the Talmud calls "rabbinic" law. On this basis he concluded that the document must be of Pharisaic origin! See An Unknown Jewish Sect (New York, 1970), p. 162. But it is now known that Schechter was correct: the documents are later copies of Qumran texts. We must keep in mind, however, that the notion of what is "found in Scripture" is problematic. 35 L. Schiffman (The Halakhah at Qumran [Leiden, 1975], pp. 22-76) suggests that the Qumran sect distinguished laws that were derived from the simple meaning of</page><page sequence="11">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 427 the Sadducees was the fundamental question of the relationship between the written and the oral Torah, and the status of the oral Torah-its methods, authority, and writing, in my opinion, has no solid basis" (my italics).36 There is every possibility that Sadducean tradition accepted the wa- ter libation. It certainly cannot be claimed that the Sadducees de- nied the libation on the grounds that it was not explicitly written in Scripture. More importantly, Rabbinic traditions generally consider the li- bation as having a basis in Scripture. The exception is a tradition attributed to R. Yohanan in both BT and PT which asserts that the libation is a z)z n l5n) n25n (law given to Moses at Sinai).37 BT at- tributes the tradition to "R. Yohanan in the name of R. Nehunia of the valley of Havran," while in ySuk 4.1, 54b R. Ba in the name of R. Hiyya attributes this opinion to R. Yohanan without mention of R. Nehunia. The Palestinian attribution is of some interest because it does not link the tradition to any tanna but to R. Yohanan him- self. This may suggest that the nonscriptural understanding of the libation reflects later amoraic ideas. Indeed, tannaitic sources con- sider the libation as scripturally based. Thus Sifre Num, ?150:38 R. Nathan says, "to be poured as a libation of fermented drink to the Lord" (Num 28:7). The verse speaks of two libations: one is the water libation and one is the wine libation. Scripture (the "revealed" laws; n5)3) from those that were derived from complex exe- gesis (the "hidden" laws; inom) and were known only to the sect. The two-tiered view of the law is not identical to the written/oral classification of the Rabbis, but it is close. See also J. Milgrom's discussion of "homogenization" as an exegetical tech- nique of the Temple Scroll in "The Qumran Cult: Its Exegetical Principles," Temple Scroll Studies (above, n 29), pp. 165-80: "There was only one difference [between the Qumranites and the rabbis], and it made all the difference. It is exemplified by their respective use of the exegetical technique of homogenization/binyan 'ab. In the Temple Scroll it produced Scripture. For the rabbis it produced oral law" (p. 178). 36 Sussmann, MMT, p. 47, n 185. 37 bSuk 34a (see Diqduqe Soferim, ad loc.), 44a, bMQ 3b, bZev 1 Ob; ySuk 4.1, 54b. For variants see E.

Nathan understands Num 28:7 to prescribe libations of both water and wine. A similar midrash, although based on Num 29:31, is attributed to R. Akiba: It says [in the sacrificial instructions] on the sixth day, "and its libations" (Num 29:31). The verse speaks of two libations: one is the water libation and one is the wine libation.40 R. Akiba derives the water libation from an irregularity in the otherwise identical formulation of the sacrificial prescriptions for the days of Sukkot (Num 29:12-28). In Num 29:31 the word for "libations" is spelled plene u (nesakheha), indicating that two libations are required. In the Tosefta R. Akiba also alludes to the scriptural origin of the water libation: R. Akiba said: The Torah said ... bring a water libation on Suk- kot [since it is the season for rains]4' in order that the rain waters may be blessed for you. And the Torah states, "Any of the earth's communities that does not make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem to bow low to the King, Lord of Hosts, shall receive no rain . .. (Zech 14:17).42 R. Akiba states explicitly that the Torah has ordained the water li- bation, although he does not cite a Pentateuchal prooftext here.43 Fi- nally R. Yehuda b. Betera in Sifre Num ?150 also finds a scriptural source for the libation which is derived from irregularities in Num 29:12-28.44 Thus three tannaitic opinions find scriptural authority 39 R. Hillel suggests that the verse could have read "to be poured as fermented drink to the Lord." The superfluous word "libation" refers to the water libation. Al- ternatively, the fact that the verse specifies "a libation of fermented drink" implies that there is also another type of libation that does not consist of fermented drink- the water libation. 40 bTa'an 2b, bZev l1lOb. For textual variants see Diamond, Bavli Ta'anit, pp. 274-275. 41 The words "since it is the season for rains" are found in MS Erfurt of tSuk 3.18 and tRH 1.12, and in MSS London and Erfurt of tRH 1.12. They are omitted in MS Vienna of both tSuk and tRH. See TK 4:885. 42 tSuk 3.18; cf. tRH 1.12, Sifre Num, ?150. 43 Diamond (Bavli Ta'anit, pp. 333-334) notes that R. Akiba intends to provide a justification for the libation, not supply its source. The reason the Torah commanded that the libation be brought is because of its impact on rain. In any case, the source of the libation, for R. Akiba, is Scripture. 44 R. Yehuda b. Betera says: It is written on the second [day of Sukkot] "and their libations" (Num 29:19) [nnzt)1], on the sixth day "and its libations" (29:31)</page><page sequence="13">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 429 for the libation. Only the BT version of R. Yohanan's statement, which attributes the tradition to R. Nehunia, claims that the libation does not derive from the Torah.4s Hence the dominant, and perhaps unanimous, tannaitic opinion considered the water libation as a bib- lical commandment. Even had they believed the Sadducees rejected the "Oral Law," the Pharisees/Rabbis could not have applied this charge to the libation. But this whole discussion is anachronistic. The notion of the "two Torahs" is a concept that developed only after the destruction of the temple.46 Pharisees and early tannaim could not have accused the Sadducees of denying "the Oral Law," for that category did not yet exist.47 Indeed, even Rabbinic sources do not claim unambiguously [n'zt,l], and on the seventh day "according to their laws" (29:35) [bVDVnt]. Behold, [the three extra letters]-n , ,n-here is water. Hence here is a hint of the water li- bation from the Torah." This midrash is also attributed to R. Yehudah b. Betera in bTa'an 2b, bShab 103b, and bZev 1 lOb. In yRH 1.3, 57b; ySuk 4.1, 54b; and yShev 1.7, 33b it is attributed to R. Akiba. See Diamond, Bavli Ta'anit, pp. 332-334 for comments and source criticism. 45 Similar confusion surrounds the willow ritual: bSuk 44a transmits the opinions that it "has a basis from the Prophets" (oD'') nti), a "custom of the prophets" (ot''n -i-nm), and a "law given to Moses at Sinai." However, Abba Sha'ul derives the ritual from Lev 23:40 (bSuk 34a and 44a). Cf. ySuk 4.1, 54b. 46 See P. Schiifer, "Das 'Dogma' von der mundlichen Torah," Studien zur Ge- schichte und Theologie des rabbinischen Judentums (Leiden, 1978), pp. 153-197; J. Neusner, The Rabbinic Traditions about the Pharisees before 70 (Leiden, 1971) 3:177-179. 47 Some scholars cite evidence to the contrary from a frequently overinterpreted passage from Josephus. He distinguishes the Sadducees from the Pharisees in that the former accept only the written Scripture, whereas the latter possess "traditions handed down by the fathers and not written in the Laws of Moses," which the former reject (AJ 13.297). Josephus does not say that these traditions are oral, but only that they are not written in the Torah of Moses. They certainly cannot be identified with "the oral Torah," which later Rabbis would claim was given to Moses along with the written Torah at Sinai. Saldarini's analysis of this passage is judicious (Pharisees, Scribes, and Sadducees, p. 303): "[O]ral Torah is of limited value as a category because in a sense, all Jews had their own oral Torah. That is, each locale and probably each sub- group or social class had its own customs and specific rules for how to live Judaism. These laws and customs had developed over decades and centuries and were common to all groups. The Pharisees, and later the Rabbis, promoted a certain version of such rules with an underlying vision of the Jewish way of life. Josephus' characterization of the Sadducees, that they accept no observance apart from the laws, serves to con- trast them with the Pharisees. Thus it means simply that they observed the biblical laws as they interpreted them and that they rejected the Pharisaic interpretation." Gei- ger (Urschrift und Uebersetzungen, p. 133) also raised doubt about the accuracy of Josephus' statement. See too Sussmann, MMT, p. 57, n. 185, and his comment cited above, pp. 426-427.</page><page sequence="14">430 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that the Sadducees denied oral tradition. Sussmann observes of early Rabbinic sources that "it seems to me that they [the sages] never speak about them [the Sadducees] explicitly as evildoers and here- tics; these ideas emerge only from the general context."48 The erroneous conception of the Sadducees as principaled literalists originated in medieval times.49 48 MMT, p. 50, n 168. Already Geiger (Urschrift und Uebersetzgun, pp. 133-134) realized that Rabbinic literature does not suggest that the Sadducees are biblical lit- eralists: " . . . nirgends ist die Rede bei ihm (von dem Thalmud) davon, dass die Sadd. sich lediglich an den Text gehalten haben, wahrend die Pharis. Traditionen einer mundlichen Ueberlieferung folgten, und nur spaitere Rabbinen haben die Karaiten mit den alten Sadd. identificierend, die Grundsatze jener auf diese iuber- tragen." So too Le Moyne, Les Sadduce'ens, pp. 361-362. Note that in mYad 4.7 the Sadducees prove their opinions from a qal we-homer inference, a quintessential rab- binic exegetical technique (cf. bBB 1 15b). Why do they not simply appeal to the bib- lical source? tYom 1.8 transmits a dialogue in which a Sadducee explains to his son that although they "interpret" (wint) the verse in one way, they always follow the practice of the sages. Similarly yBB 8.1, 16a explains the Sadducean law of inheri- tance by explaining how they "interpret" the verse. Thus Rabbinic sources realize the Sadducees engaged in exegesis (Wrtl), as did "the sages," but claim that the Sad- ducean interpretations are mistaken. See too mMak 1.6. D. Halivni (Peshat and De- rash [New York, 1991], p. 78) points out that in his commentary to Lev 16:2 Rashi calls a certain explanation the derash (as opposed to the peshat). But that very inter- pretation is attributed to the Sadducees in bYom 53a. 49 Several factors eventually led to the idea that a party plank of the Sadducees was to deny "the" oral law. First, the increasingly unfavorable image of the Sadducees led to a general conception of them as wicked heretics who rejected Rabbinic tradition. Ultimately they were grouped with heretical sects such as Christians, gnostics, Sa- maritans, dualists, and others, with little attention paid to the differences between them. (The amalgamation of sects began already in later talmudic sources. See Suss- mann, MMT, p. 45, n 147; Le Moyne, Les Sadduc&amp;ens, pp. 99-100). Second, Christian censors objected to the term min ("heretic" or "sectarian") which they thought re- ferred to Christians or Jewish-Christians. Copyists and printers were forced to sub- stitute "Sadducee" for min so as not to offend the censor. Third, the scholion to Megillat Ta'anit asserts that the Sadducees interpreted the Bible devarim ki-khtavam, "according to the literal meaning." This creates the impression that the Sadducees are biblical literalists who deny Rabbinic exegesis. The scholion, however, is of post- talmudic provenance, and cannot be trusted as an authentic historical source. Fourth and most important was the identification of the Sadducees with the Karaites, a mis- take made by both medievals and moderns. Karaites openly professed their rejection of the (rabbinic) oral law, so this position was imputed to the Sadducees, their pur- ported forerunners. Now the Karaites did reject the water libation (Revel, "Inquiry into the Sources of Karaite Halakha," p. 352), so this position was naturally ascribed to the Sadducees as well. But whatever the affinities between them, the Sadducees were not Karaites.</page><page sequence="15">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 431 While the Pharisees could not have accused the Sadducees of re- jecting the Oral Law (since the concept did not exist, and the Sad- ducees possessed their own exegeses and traditions), and did not (there being no evidence in Rabbinic sources), they could, of course, have accused them of arriving at incorrect exegeses and of rejecting the true interpretation of various laws. There may have been a con- troversy related to the water libation, just as there were conflicts concerning other laws and rituals. But we cannot, without solid evi- dence, assume that the dispute turned on the legitimacy of the liba- tion. As noted above, the sources themselves do not specify the nature of the disagreement, and leave open the possibility that the controversy related to some aspect of the libation: how, when, or by whom the rite should be performed. III. A Controversy over the Place of the Libation? What then was the nature of the controversy? In his comprehen- sive study of the Sadducees Le Moyne suggests that the Saducees believed that the libation should be poured at the base of the altar and not upon the altar, as the Rabbis required. The people re- sponded with such vehemence because they feared the supply of rain was jeopardized by the incorrect performance of the ritual.50 This suggestion deserves to be explored in greater detail. It appears that there were indeed different opinions as to the proper place for drink offerings. The Bible does not describe the performance of li- bations in any great detail. Num 15:7 legislates: "And a third of a hin of wine, as an offering of pleasing odor to the Lord." This im- plies, according to some scholars, that the libation was poured di- rectly on the altar, for what else would create a "pleasing odor"? On the other hand, "pleasing odor" may be a stereotypical cultic term meaning that the offering is accepted.51 Ben Sira 50:14-15 provides explicit evidence, presumably eye- witness testimony, that libations were not poured upon the top of the altar: And when he finished the service at the altars, to adorn the offering of the Most High, the Almighty, he stretched out his 50 Le Moyne, Sadduceens, p. 286. However, he also raises the possibility, with due reserve, that the Sadducees rejected the libation, (pp. 285, 288). See also n. 68. 51 B. Baentsch, Exodus-Leviticus-Numeri (Gottingen, 1903), p. 534.</page><page sequence="16">432 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW hand to the cup, and poured out some of the blood of the grape; he poured it out at the foot of the altar, a pleasing odor unto the Most High, the King of all.52 Ben Sira adopts the biblical phrase "a pleasing odor" (06Gjnv &amp;vo6iag) of the LXX to Num 15:7, but describes the High Priest as pouring the wine at the base of the altar. Josephus seems to agree, saying that "they pour the wine around the altar."53 In Jub 7:5 the wine is not sprinkled on the base of the altar but directly on the fire: And he (Noah) placed all of their sacrifice upon it, kneaded with oil. And after that, he sprinkled wine on the fire which he had placed upon the altar.54 The Temple Scroll prescribes that wine offerings be placed on the altar beside the sacrifices: ... and burn them on the fire which is upon the altar, each bull and its pieces by it, and its cereal offering of fine flour upon it, and the wine of its drink offering by it, of which will be poured upon it. And the priests, the sons of Aaron, shall offer every- thing upon the altar, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor before the Lord."55 The scroll instructs that the bull be burned together with its ac- companying offerings. The wine libation is actually poured upon the sacrifice itself. In the previous column the scroll directs the 52 So the Greek. The Hebrew preserves essentially the same reading, 50:19-20. See Sefer Ben Sira ha-Shalem, ed. M. Segal (Jerusalem, 1953), p. 341. 53 AJ 3:234: REpI T6v pcop6v. It is likely that Josephus, like Sira, reports what he actually knew of temple practice. But AJ was written at least twenty years after the destruction, so Josephus may be offering his interpretation of Num 15:7. 54 The same picture emerges from Jub 7:36, the commandment to bring the fruit and grapes of the fourth year as sacrificial offerings: "And let one offer up the first fruits which are acceptable before the Lord Most High, who made heaven and earth and everything, so that they might offer up in the juice thefirst of the wine and the oil asfirstfruits upon the altar of the Lord, who will accept it." (In Rabbinic law the pro- duce is to be consumed in Jerusalem by the owners; mMS 5.1-5.) See too Jub 15:2, .... and their libation he offered up upon the altar;" and 16:23: . . . and their (fruit) offerings, and their libations, and all their fat he offered upon the altar as cho- sen burnt offering to the Lord for a sweet-smelling odor." 55 Col 34:11-14; Y.

One is tempted to see a polemic in the re- peated insistence that the priests offer everything upon the altar, perhaps a reaction to the tradition of Ben Sira that libations are poured at the base. But the repeated wording follows Lev 1:9 so closely that polemical intent is not demonstrable.56 In similar terms the prescriptions for sacrifices for the "Feast of the Wood Offering" instruct the priest to "burn all of it on the altar, together with its cereal offering and its drink offering; an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the Lord."s7 So too the wine offering at the annual "Feast of First Fruits of Wine" is to be poured "on the altar of the Lord."58 These sources indicate that libations are to be poured upon the flames of the fire, not at the base of the altar.59 The relevant Rabbinic sources are problematic. Sifre Num ?107, reflects a conflict over this issue.

In addition, the con- text in Leviticus speaks only of the meat itself, while the scroll has applied this sum- mary to the libations and cereal offerings as well. Hence a reaction to a conflicting opinion cannot be ruled out. 57 Col. 23:16-17 (Yadin, The Temple Scroll 2:106). See also Col. 23:4-8. 58 Column 21:10 (Yadin 2:95). On this feast see J. M. Baumgarten, "4Q Halakha 5, The Law of Hadash and the Pentecontad Calendar," JJS 27 (1976): 36-45 (re- printed in Studies in Qumran Law [Leiden, 1977], pp. 133-142); Yadin 1: 108-11, 2:80-96, columns 19-21.

The author adds that the wine must be "new wine" (see Yadin's comments) and that it be poured "on the altar" of God, not just "to God." Again the point is that the wine must be poured upon the altar. 59 Yadin (The Temple Scroll 1: 150) points out that the scroll, against the Rabbinic law, demands that the drink offerings be placed on the fire. His presentation of the Rabbinic evidence, however, is incomplete.</page><page sequence="18">434 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW would extinguish the flames. But the Torah said, "A perpetual fire shall be burning on the altar, not to go out" (Lev 6:16). What must "a pleasing odor to God" teach? (Upon the bowls) The conclusion it)tv n) 5y ("upon the bowls") is an emendation based on the Pesiqta Zutarti. The Vatican manuscript, considered the best text, reads 0w)mx- n 5' y (upon the fires). But it is then hard to make sense of the midrash. The first printing omits the conclu- sion entirely (as does the truncated form of the baraita in bZev 9 lb). There are some further difficulties with this passage as is evident from the apparatus. Given the non-Rabbinic sources, it appears that the midrash reflects two authentic halakhic opinions. This is not a case of one legal option raised as a complete hypothetical serving merely as a literary device to create the structure of the midrash. Whatever the correct manuscript tradition, the midrash testifies that the Rabbis recognized two possibilities: either wine libations are poured directly on the altar (as in Jubilees and the Temple Scroll), or into the bowls perched upon the southwest corner of the altar, into which, according to the Mishnah, the priest poured the Sukkot water and wine libations (mSuk 4.8). We thus find an internal Rab- binic dispute as to where wine libations belong.60 Similar confusion appears in rabbinic sources that rule on the fate of the wine donated to the temple. In tMen 12.10 we find: One who donates wine: According to [R. Akiba and]61 R. Tarfon they put it in the bowls. [One who donates] oil: According to R. Tarfon it is offered on the fires. 60 Note that the Sifre refers to the wine libations brought throughout the year that accompanied the tamid offerings and various other sacrifices. Cf. mZev 6.2 and mTam 7.1. Maimonides (MT, Laws of Sacrifices 2.1) rules that the regular wine libations were poured at the base of the altar and descended into the pits below the altar. Rabad objects that they were poured in the bowls, and the supercommentaries discuss the issue at length. The Kesef Mishnah comments: "It would seem . .. that our master [Maimonides] thinks that since the bowls are only mentioned by the gemara in connection with the libations on Sukkot, it implies that the bowls were used in connection with those libations alone." (Therefore wine libations throughout the rest of the year were not poured in the bowls.) The imprecision of Rabbinic sources as to the proper place for libations is reflected in the medieval dispute. 61 S. Lieberman (Tosefet Rishonim [Jerusalem, 1937-39] 2:263) suggests that the name of R. Akiba should be added, and perhaps that R. Tarfon's name should be de- leted as well. The printed Tosefta, the Vienna manuscript, and the version in bZev</page><page sequence="19">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 435 Yet in bZev 91b, Samuel rules that wine donated to the temple must be sprinkled on the altar.62 We see the same tension as in the Sifre between the bowls and the flames as the correct place for the wine. Three opinions are reflected in these traditions. Ben Sira and Josephus claim that wine libations were poured on the base of the altar. Jubilees and the Temple Scroll prescribe libations sprinkled upon the sacrifices or upon the fires that burned on the altar. Rab- binic sources claim that the Sukkot water and wine libations went into bowls. Statuatory wine offerings were to be poured either on the base of the altar or into the bowls. It is clear that contradictory opinions were held between, and perhaps within, different groups. Comparative religion yields some clues as to the substantive issue behind this conflict. Walter Burkert, in his work on Greek religion, notes that in the most ancient times libations were poured directly on the ground.63 Drink was offered to the dead, demons, subterra- nean powers, or chthonic deities upon the earth which they were be- lieved to inhabit. Later, as conceptions changed, this practice became problematic: how could an anthropomorphic celestial god derive benefit from a libation that had been spilled on the ground? It became more common to pour libations on the altar of the god, where the fires indicated that the god had consumed the offerings, or to place them in bowls upon or beside the altar. A similar devel- opment may have occurred in Israelite religion. The old custom, perhaps pre-Yahwistic or borrowed from pagan neighbors, is per- haps reflected in some biblical accounts: Samuel pours a libation of water "before the Lord," as does David with the water brought to 91b read, "One who donates wine: According to R. Akiba they put it in the bowls." R. Tarfon's name was added under the influence of Rashi's comments to the baraita in bZev. However, Tosafot (bMen 91b, s.v. ,n,'et) quote the baraita as follows: "One who donates wine: According to R. Akiba, they put it in the bowls; according to R. Tarfon they put it on the flames." Cf. Tosafot, bHul 23b, s.v. Irnw. This ver- sion preserves the disagreement reflected in the Sifre, and also explains why Samuel appears to contradict the tannaitic consensus. 62 See Yadin, The Temple Scroll, p. 150. Yadin claims that Samuel rules that only wine donated to the temple is to be sprinkled on the altar. Therefore other wine offerings-libations-are to be poured at the base of the altar. I am not sure whether this inference is sound. 63 Greek Religion, trans. J.

Jeremiah fulminates against idolatrous Israelites who pour libations on the "rooftops and in the streets of Jerusalem," and "by every high hill and leafy tree."65 On the other hand, King Ahaz poured a libation upon the altar he built and commanded the High Priest to offer all libations there.66 With the growth of temples and monotheistic ideas attempts may have been made to have the libation consumed directly by the 64 1 Sam 7:6; 2 Sam 23:16 (= 1 Chr 1 1: 18). Of course I am not claiming that these were the Sukkot libations described in the Mishnah. Alexander Rofe ("The Onset of Sects in Postexilic Judaism," The Social World of Formative Christianity and Juda- ism, ed. J. Neusner, et al. [Philadelphia, 1988], 40-41) adduces the LXX translation of 1 Sam 7:6 as evidence that the libation controversy existed already in the third century BCE. To the Hebrew "before the Lord" the LXX adds the phrase "onto the earth." Rof6 claims that the Hebrew "before the Lord" indicates that the libation was poured onto an altar. The LXX reading is therefore unintelligible: "This is self-contradictory. One does not pour water 'before the Lord' onto the earth, one pours it on the altar!" He sug- gests that a Sadducean scribe added the extra phrase to deny the Pharisees a scriptural source for pouring the water libation on the altar. Hence there is evidence of the liba- tion controversy when the LXX Samuel was completed in the third century BCE. Rofe is aware that the Greek translators were probably not aware of the details of temple worship, hence it is unlikely that the translator added the polemical phrase. He is forced to suggest that a Sadducean scribe added the phrase to the Hebrew Vorlage of the LXX. This fascinating and brilliant argument is ultimately implausible. First, it is unclear that "before the Lord" necessarily means "on the altar." The ceremony is pen- itential, involving confession and fasting, a context where it is more appropriate that the water be poured on the ground (see Rashi ad loc. and Lam 2:19). See also Lev 9:6, where the people stand "before the Lord," which obviously does not mean "on the altar." And see N. Rabban, "Before the Lord," Tarbiz 23 (1951-52): 1-8 [Hebrew]. Moreover we have noted that libations in many cultures were poured on the ground, yet were intended for the gods, so the LXX version is by no means "self- contradictory." The verb ow [= poured, spilled] rather than the regular lvJ [= to pour a libation], indicates that the water was spilled upon the ground, not poured upon the altar as a libation. It is theoretically possible that the Pharisees cited the verse, albeit against the peshat, as evidence that the libation belongs on the altar, and so the Sad- ducees would have an interest in tampering with the text. But this seems unlikely. Sec- ondly, the reconstruction of the textual history is problematic. We must assume that a Sadducean scribe added to the Hebrew, but while this version was not preserved in the Massoretic Text, the "correction" remained in the Greek. In any case, Rofe's argument shows at best that some group (not necessarily the Sadducees), disagreed as to how the libation should be performed. Finkelstein (The Pharisees, p. 113) makes a similar argument based on the change in 1 Chr 11:18, which reads jmn from its parallel in 2 Sam 23:16, which reads sw. But these forms derive from the same root, so the au- thor has gained nothing. Variations such as these abound. 65 Jer 19:13; Ezek 20:28. See too Jer 7:18; 32:29; 44:15-19; Isa 57:5; 65:11; Deut 32:38. 66 2 Kings 16:13-15.</page><page sequence="21">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 437 deity. Pouring libations into bowls or sprinkling them upon the flames were two ways of accomplishing this goal.67 Thus support can be found for Le Moyne's conjecture that the Sadducees disagreed as to how the water libation should be per- formed but did not reject the libation completely.68 The priest who 67 Jacob Milgrom (The JPS Commentary: Numbers [Philadelphia, 1991]) proposes a similar sort of development to account for contradictions in the biblical libation laws in his commentary to Num 4:8 and 28:7 (pp. 26, 118-119). He notes that Exod 25:29 and 37:16 mandate the manufacture of golden vessels for libations. The golden vessels must have served the inner altar, for all vessels used on the outer altar were made of bronze (Exod 27:3). Yet Exod 30:9 categorically forbids the pouring of libations on the inner altar. According to Milgrom, the Israelite cult rejected the crass anthropomor- phism that God needs food. The loaves of bread left on the table were consumed by the priests so as not to give the impression that God consumes them, and no libations were to be poured on the altar for the same reason. To complicate matters, Num 28:7 contains the curious formulation, "The libation with it shall be a quarter of a hin for each lamb, to be poured in the 'sacred precinct' (wqpi) as an offering of fermented drink to the Lord." What does wrtp3 mean here? What sacred precinct or "holy place"? Milgrom suggests that the term could refer to the sanctuary, i.e., the tent of meeting and the inner altar. But then the contradiction with Exod 30:9 forbidding libations on the inner altar crops up again. So Milgrom suggests that this clause of Num 28:7, together with Exod 25:29 and 37:16, "are vestiges of an original libation on the inner altar, one that was later forbidden as a gross anthropomorphism, lest one think that the Deity-in his pri- vate chambers-actually imbibed a liquid." Thus libations were originally placed in bowls on a table for the Deity to consume and were poured directly on the altar. Later this practice was banned and the libations were presumably transferred to the outer al- tar, or, like the bread, consumed by priests. 68 Le Moyne was actually anticipated by Hochman and Zeitlin, but while Le Moyne made no attempt to explain the disagreement, these scholars advanced implausible theories. J. Hochman (Jerusalem Temple Festivities [London, 1911], pp. 85-87) suggests that when Jannaeus (identified with the Sadducean priest) poured the libation at the base of the altar he was "understood thereby to declare it an offering to the chthonic gods, and also to proclaim his own adhesion to the malprac- tices of the Hellenic priests of the pre-Maccabean period, who seem to have intro- duced the immoral Astarte cult into Jerusalem." Hochman claims that in Babylonia, Egypt, and Athens libations were always poured at the base as offering to the "chthonic gods." To distance Judaism from these heathen practices the Pharisees re- quired the libation to be poured on the top of the altar. This explanation is based on the mistaken assumption that the Sadducees were Hellenistic sympathizers. And why would Jannaeus antagonize the people intentionally? Moreover, the "Hellenic priests" had not practiced for years, so there is little possibility that Jannaeus con- sciously imitated them. (Hochman proposes that the Hellenic rites were "secretly maintained.") Hochman seems aware of the difficulty, and he therefore argues that Jannaeus was "understood" by the people as offering to the chthonic gods when he (inadvertantly? by mistake?) poured the libation at the base of the altar. But the people surely would not have known Babylonian practices, nor suspected that Jan- naeus emulated an old "Hellenic" ritual. S. Zeitlin (Studies in the Early History of Judaism [New York, 1973-78] 2:276-277) claims that the Sadducees wanted to retain</page><page sequence="22">438 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW poured his water "at his feet"69 believed that libations were to be poured upon the base of the altar, in accord with the testimony of Ben Sira and Josephus. Others (priests? Pharisees?) insisted that the libation be poured directly on the altar or in the bowls. The Rabbis apparently subscribed to the latter opinion and preserved memories of bitter conflict over this issue. The problem with this theory is that the Qumran materials and Ju- bilees, texts now associated with Sadducean law, assert that drink offerings are to be sprinkled on the altar.70 Based on these sources we would not expect a Sadducean priest to pour a libation on the base of the altar or on the ground, but rather on the flames. Now I have pointed out that the Mishnah does not claim the priest was a Sadducee. The offending priest may have inherited the (non- the "old tradition" of pouring water libations upon the ground whenever one desired to do so. As wealthy landowners, they desired rain more than the urban Pharisees, and thought water libations efficacious. The Pharisees rejected this ritualistic idea. They believed that God provided rain, and God could be propitiated only through prayer. Were it not that the practice was so widespread, the Pharisees would have abandoned the ritual completely. As a compromise, they limited the libation to the altar in the temple. Thus Zeitlin turns Rabbinic sources on their head-the Pharisees really op- posed the ritual; the Sadducees were its proponents. At Yavneh the Pharisees finally "succeeded" in abolishing the rite. Cf. Zeitlin, The Rise and Fall of the Judean State (Philadelphia, 1962-78) 1:183-184 and 3:256-257. It is instructive to compare Zeit- lin's analysis with that of Finkelstein in his "The Pharisees: Their Origin and Their Phi- losophy," HTR 22 (1929): 193-201. Finkelstein believed that the Sadducees rejected the oral law and hence the source of the libation (see nn 1-2, above), but he nonetheless explained the controversy on other grounds. He proposed that the Sadducees did not reject water libationsper se, but opposed Pharisaic efforts to shift the focus of the fes- tival from the joy of the harvest to judgment about rain. Living in Jerusalem, the urban Pharisees had no connection to the autumnal harvest, and were far more concerned about rainfall which supplied their drinking water. The rural Sadducees would not ex- perience the effects of a drought until next year's harvest, hence concern for rain meant less to them than the harvest celebration. Ironically, Finkelstein and Zeitlin start with similar ideas about the nature of the two parties, but come to totally opposite conclu- sions as to which party desired libations more! L. Venetianer ("Die Eleusinische Mysterien im Tempel zu Jerusalem," Popular Wissenschaftliche Monatsblatter," 17 [1897]: 179-80) makes the astounding claim that Jannaeus (= the Sadducean priest) did not oppose the ceremony at all. He was so exhausted from the night long festivities that he could not even hold up his arm to pour the libation on the altar! 69 Or the halakhic opinion attributed to the priest in the Rabbinic legend. 70 We can always conjecture that the Qumran sect disagreed with the Sadducean law on this point, although they generally accepted Sadducean traditions; or that the renegade priest deviated from the standard Sadducean practice. But this places us in an uncontrolled world of speculation.</page><page sequence="23">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 439 Sadducean) tradition of Josephus and Ben Sira, and may have offended those who held that libations belong on the altar. So this is one possible reconstruction of the controversy, but it probably re- quires rejecting the tradition that the priest was a Sadducee. IV. A Controversy over the Sabbath? A second possibility is that the libation controversy stemmed from a disagreement over Sabbath observance. This was one of the fiercest halakhic conflicts of ancient Judaism.71 One major dispute was the permissability of bringing sacrifices on the Sabbath be- sides the daily tamid offerings and the Sabbath offering specifically ordained by Lev 23:38.72 The acrimonious debate over the nature of the calendar arose primarily from this concern.73 At issue was the confluence of the Sabbath and festivals. While the Rabbis de- cided that cultic activity generally took precedence over the Sab- bath, other groups held the opposite opinion.74 They attempted to prevent the confluence of the Sabbath and festivals so as to evade the conflict. The solar calendars of Jubilees and of the Qumran texts are constructed specifically to circumvent such situations, which inevitably occur according to the Rabbinic lunar-solar mode of reckoning. It is therefore not surprising that the authors of MMT apparently began their polemical letter by setting forth their calen- dar (of which only the last few lines are preserved.)75 This was 71 See J. van Goudoever, Biblical Calendars (Leiden, 1959), p. 63; S. Talmon, "The Calendar of the Covenanters of the Judean Desert," Scripta Hierosolymitana 4 (1958): 167-174; L. Schiffman, The Halakhah at Qumran (Leiden, 1976), pp. 84- 133. See also S. Talmon ("Yom Hakkippurim in the Habakkuk Scroll," Biblica 32 [1951]: 549-563) who suggests that the Habakkuk Scroll shows that the sect ob- served Yom Kippur on a different day than the "official" fast, and the "Wicked Priest" interfered with their observance. Such controversies are not unknown among the Rabbis themselves, as the famous account of mRH 2.8-9 attests. 72 CD 1 1:17 rules that "no one should offer on the altar on the Sabbath, except the burnt offering of the Sabbath; for thus it is written, 'apart from your Sabbath offerings"' (Lev 23:38). 73 See Talmon, "The Calendar of the Covenanters," pp. 171-174, 178-183. 74 See the new fragment 4Q513 discussed by Baumgarten, "Polemics in New Fragments," pp. 395-397. The text condemns the opposing party, evidently precur- sors of the Rabbis, for violating the Sabbath by performing the Comer ceremony. Cf. mMen 10.3. 75 See Sussmann, MMT, p. 24, and n 61; Jub 1:10; 6:17-38.</page><page sequence="24">440 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW evidently the most important issue for them, the primary dispute that separated them from their opponents. Several of the Rabbinic traditions of the Sadducees/Boethusians relate to the calendar or the Sabbath. The Rabbis held that the cer- emony of erecting willows around the altar took precedence over the Sabbath on the seventh day of Sukkot. According to tSuk 3.1, Boethusians placed heavy rocks on the willows before the Sabbath, since "the Boethusians do not agree that the laying down of willows supersedes the Sabbath." Note that the Boethusians did not object to the ritual per se, but only to the rabbinic claim that the activity takes place on the Sabbath.76 The controversy over the date of the 'omer pertains to both the calendar and the Sabbath. The Mishnah rules that the 'omer is to be cut the day after Passover even if this is a Sabbath, and explains that the elaborate ceremony preceding the cutting flaunts the Boethusians, who believe "that the 'omer is not cut on the day after the festival."77 For the same reason tRH 1.15 asserts the Boethusians hired witnesses to deceive the sages about the sighting of the New Moon. m'Eruv 6.2 preserves a tradi- tion of a controversy with a Sadducee over the 'eruv, an issue re- lated to Sabbath observance, although not to the calendar. Rabbinic literature preserves but ten other seemingly authentic conflicts in- volving Sadducees/Boethusians:78 plotting witnesses, the ritual of the red heifer, menstrual purity, purity of scrolls of Scripture, purity of animal bones, purity of a flow of liquid (pix3), culpability for damages caused by slaves, the incense offering on Yom Kippur, a daughter's right to inheritance, and purity of the Menorah.79 Thus 76 Contra TK 4:870, and the Rishonim cited there, n 3. 77 They interpreted the ambiguous "the day after the Sabbath" of Lev 23:16 as re- ferring to the Sunday following the first Sabbath after the conclusion of Passover. (This is now clear from the calendar of the Temple Scroll; but see bMen 65a-b, and see Sussmann, MMT, pp. 30-31, n 81a.) Their motivation, in part, was to prevent the confluence of the Comer offering and the Sabbath, as occurs periodically according to the Rabbinic calendar. 78 The series of controversies has been collected many times, but most include the unreliable information from Megillat Tacanit and some later traditions. Follow- ing Sussmann, MMT, p. 44, n 147, I list only controversies that seem authentic in that they are preserved in the older Rabbinic sources. Schiffman has catalogued the halakhic regulations contained in MMT ("Systems of Jewish Law," pp. 245-246). Of the controversies preserved in Rabbinic literature, the following are addressed in MMT: purification of those who prepare the red heifer, purity of streams of liquid, impurity of skins and bones of unclean animals. 79 Witnesses, mMak 1.6; red heifer, mPar 3.7; menstrual purity, Nid 4.2; scrolls and bones, mYad 4.6; liquid flow and damages caused by slaves: mYad 4.7, incense, yYoma 1.5; daughter's inheritance, tYad 2.20; Menorah, tHag 3.35.</page><page sequence="25">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 441 four of the fourteen controversies devolve from issues of the Sab- bath and the calendar. The only tradition pertaining to festivals but unrelated to the Sabbath is the incense offering on Yom Kippur. Here the groups dispute the proper way to perform the ritual. It is therefore likely that the disagreement over the water libation related to the manner in which the ritual was to be carried out, as suggested above, or to the Sabbath. According to the Mishnah the Sukkot libations were performed every day of the festival.80 The Sabbath differed from the other days only in that no procession from the Pool of Siloam to the temple took place. Priests drew the water on Friday, left it overnight in an unconsecrated vessel, and poured the libation at the appointed time for the ceremony, after the morning tamid offering. How would a Sadducean (or at least a non-Pharisaic) priest have reacted to this scenario? Let us first consider the Sadducean laws of the intermediate days of Sukkot. Num 29:12-32 prescribes numerous sacrifices for each of the seven days of the festival. Obviously, no matter on which day of the week the festival began, the Sabbath had to coincide with one of these days. This presented no problem for Rabbinic law; sacrifices prescribed for the festivals were brought on the Sab- bath. But how did those who believed that cult activity (apart from the Sabbath offerings) ceased on the Sabbath solve this problem? The columns of the Temple Scroll that contain the laws of these sacrifices are incomplete, but the prescriptions for the first four days are extant.81 That sacrifices for the fourth day are commanded in the routine formulation is crucial, for according to the calendar of the Scroll, the first day of Sukkot fell each year on a Wednesday, so the fourth intermediate day would always be a Sabbath.82 Did the authors of the Temple Scroll (assuming that they followed Sad- ducean law)83 believe that these sacrifices were to be brought even though the day was a Sabbath? This seems unlikely, for it runs against the raison d'etre of the fixed solar calendar. 80 mSuk 4.8. According to R. Yehudah, the libation was even performed on Shemini 'Aseret. 81 Cols. 27-29; Yadin, The Temple Scroll 2:120-126. There are minor differ- ences from the prescriptions in Numbers. 82 See the calendar constructed by Yadin, The Temple Scroll 1:118. 83 See, however, Baruch Levine, "A Further Look at the Mo'adim of the Temple Scroll" in Archaeology and History in the Dead Sea Scrolls, ed. L. Schiffman (Sheffield, 1990), pp. 53-66. Levine argues that the calendar of the Temple Scroll is not necessarily the solar calendar of Jubilees and other Qumran texts.</page><page sequence="26">442 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Yaakov Erder proposes a compelling solution to this problem. 84 He observes that the Karaites also grappled with the problem of the confluence of the Sabbath and festivals. The Ananites ruled that the sukkah was to be built on the fourteenth of Tishrei, "at twilight" (oD"21vn 1p), immediately before the festival began. This placed the Ananites in a quandary when the first day of Sukkot fell on the Sabbath, for they considered "twilight" as part of both the preced- ing and the following day. The time appointed for building the suk- kah was therefore the beginning of the Sabbath. To avoid the profanation of the Sabbath, the Ananites deferred the start of the festival until Sunday the 16th.85 Qirqisani relates that the Saddu- cees anticipated the Ananites in this calendrical adjustment; they too did not count the Sabbath among the intermediate days of Suk- kot.86 However, the Sadducean calendar was not identical to the Karaite calendar. We have seen that according to the solar calendar of Jubilees and the Temple Scroll, the fourth day of Sukkot always falls on the Sabbath. Erder concludes that Qirqisani's testimony can only mean that the intermediate Sabbath was not counted as a day of the festival.87 The fourth day of Sukkot was deferred until Sun- day the 19th, and the festival concluded with the seventh day on the following Wednesday, the 22nd of Tishre. This reconstruction neatly resolves the problem of the sacrifices prescribed for the seven intermediate days of the festival in Num- bers 28. Erder suggests that these sacrifices never entailed the des- ecration of the Sabbath since the Sabbath was not counted as an intermediate day.88 Indeed, nothing in the biblical text specifies that the seven days must be consecutive. 84 y. Erder, "Precedents Cited by 'Anan For the Postponement of Passover that Falls on Sabbath," Zion 52 (1987): 153-175 (Hebrew). He proposes the same thesis more succinctly in "When did the Karaites First Encounter Apocryphal Literature," Cathedra 42 (1987): 57-60 (Hebrew). Wacholder's attempt (The Dawn of Qumran, pp. 49-50) to avoid this problem is unconvincing. 85 A problem still remained, for twilight of the 16th was also part of the Sabbath of the 15th. The Karaites attempted to answer this contradiction as well. See Erder, "Precedents cited by 'Anan," p. 156, n 21. 86 Yehuda Hadasi ('Eshkol Hakofer [Westmeand, England, 1971 (1836)], ?98 [41d]) also claims that the Sabbath is not counted among the days of Passover and Sukkot. He too attributes this position to the Sadducees. 87 "Precedents cited by 'Anan," pp. 159-161. 88 Ibid., pp. 166-167. Yadin, The Temple Scroll 1:131 also proposed this solution, and also referred to Qirqisani. But his calendar (1 :118) does not reflect the necessary</page><page sequence="27">SADDUCEES AND WATER LIBATION-RUBENSTEIN 443 If this is the case, then the libation controversy may be explained on similar grounds. The "sectarian" priest may have performed the morning Sabbath offering but balked at having to perform the Suk- kot libations on this day. He did not consider the Sabbath as an in- termediate festival day, and thought that all festival offerings and cultic activity profaned the Sabbath. So as not to pour the libations on the altar and violate the Sabbath, he poured them at his feet. If the Mishnah framed a halakhic dispute in terms of a Josephan (or folk) tale, this explanation of the controversy is even more appeal- ing. We need not speculate as to what actually happened in the temple. Like other debates concerning temple practice on the Sab- bath, and like the related debate over the willow ceremony, the Pharisees/Rabbis ruled that the Sukkot libations should be per- formed on the Sabbath, while the Sadducees/Boethusians demurred. The main objection to this explanation is that Rabbinic sources do not specify that the event took place on the Sabbath. With the wil- low controversy, on the other hand, the Tosefta plainly states that the Boethusians believed that the willow ritual should not take place on the Sabbath. No such information is imparted about the libation. This may be explained by the form of the tradition in the Mishnah. The tradition is a narrative account of what happened on one occa- sion. Its purpose is to explain a particular law-why they say to the priest "Lift up your hand"-and not to articulate a defined legal de- bate between the Rabbis and their opponents. That the occasion was a Sabbath is not strictly necessary for this purpose. Still, the lack of explicit mention of the Sabbath is troubling. The communis opinio that the Sadducees rejected the water liba- tion is not based on solid evidence. It is not clear that the priest was a Sadducee, or that he objected to the ritual per se. The Sadducees did not reject all laws not explicitly written in Scripture. Tannaitic sources, in any case, derive the libation from biblical verses, so adjustment, for he places the seventh day on the 21st. According to Yadin, then, the sacrifices prescribed by Numbers for the fourth day were never offered. Erder, on the other hand, proposes that the sacrifices for the fourth day were deferred until Sun- day. Erder adduces further support from CD 11:17-18 (cited above, n 72), which prohibits the offering of sacrifices on the Sabbath except for the Sabbath offerings prescribed by Num 28:9-10. To what sacrifices does this law refer? As we have seen, the solar calendar generally avoids the coincidence of the Sabbath with festi- vals. The only exceptions are the fourth days of Sukkot and Passover. This law should be understood as a warning against bringing sacrifices on those days.</page><page sequence="28">444 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW there is no reason to think that the Sadducees opposed the water libation on those grounds. I have proposed two alternative hypoth- eses to explain the nature of the controversy. One suggests that the priest and his opponents disagreed as to where the libation was to be poured. The other proposes that the priest, following the Sad- ducean tradition, believed that festival offerings do not supersede the Sabbath. Objections may be made to each hypothesis, but the objections are less problematic than the current opinion. Perhaps publication of the remaining Qumran scrolls will shed more light on this issue.89 89 My thanks to Drs.
