However, only  scant research has been directed towards making this educational information accessible to the deaf.   Adaptive Hypermedia (AH) is an area of research that aims to enhance the functionality of hypermedia  systems, such as the WWW, by enabling users to personalise their interaction with the digital content  provided by such systems.  In this paper, we present a personalisable electronic book, Kids Sign Online  (KSO).  KSO utilises AH techniques together with digital video content to assist in the teaching of British  Sign Language to deaf children.  By providing an example of an adaptive WWW-based sign language  education system, we hope to broaden the accessibility of sign language learning materials and to illustrate  how AH tools and techniques may be used to address issues related to the education of the deaf in online  learning environments.    Keywords  Disability learning, Hypermedia, Adaptive hypermedia, Digital content, Online learning, Accessibility, Sign  language      Introduction    A sign language is a language that uses combinations of hand shapes and hand, arm and/or body movements  together with facial expressions to communicate without using sound (Sutton-Spence R &amp; Woll B, 1999).  In the  last thirty years, sign languages have become the standard way of teaching language to deaf children. These  languages have enabled deaf children to communicate well with other people, both hearing and deaf.  It is now  clear that, using sign language, deaf children can have perfectly normal language and communication skills  (Fischer R &amp; Lane H, 1993). For people brought up with them, sign languages play the role of native natural  languages, composed of intricate syntaxes and vocabularies.    In the context of education, both spoken and printed information has historically been translated into sign  language, in order to enable deaf students to have equal access to it.  Today, the World Wide Web (WWW), a  highly interconnected collection of computational resources, is a major source of educational information.   School children routinely use the WWW for both information seeking tasks and discovery learning.  There has  already been some work done towards tailoring web resources to increase their accessibility for the deaf.  The  main strands of the research are: how to represent sign languages within the digital domain, for example Visicast  (Visicast, 2003) and Vsign (Vsign, 2003), and how to devise writing systems for sign languages utilising such  media as line drawings, symbols and photographs (Kramer &amp; Ovadia 2000). This paper concerns an attempt to  use more sophisticated techniques for tailoring online material for the needs of speakers of sign languages. Our  approach is to use Adaptive Hypermedia.    Adaptive Hypermedia (AH) is a set of ideas and techniques aimed at extending hypermedia systems, such as the  WWW, to enable a user’s interaction to be personalised on an individual basis (Brusilovsky P et al., 1998).  AH  systems use knowledge provided by, or inferred from the behaviour of, users to tailor what information is  presented to the user and in what form.  AH systems support users in navigating hyper-documents by limiting  options for traversal, suggesting links to follow, and providing additional information about links and other  resources.  AH systems tend to be particularly useful in areas such as learning, where users have differing  information seeking requirements and different histories and preferences.    86  ISSN 1436-4522 (online) and 1176-3647 (print). © International Forum of Educational Technology &amp; Society (IFETS).

The system’s  uniqueness lies in its use of personalisation and adaptation (P&amp;A) techniques, incorporated with digital video  content, in the development of WWW-based electronic books for children.  The British Deaf Association states  that:  “Deaf people have the right to a quality education throughout their lives, which accepts their  linguistic, cultural and social identity, which builds positive self-esteem and sets no limit to their  learning.”  (British Deaf Association, 2001).     If such an aspiration is to be realised, we believe that it is crucial that educational materials found on the WWW  are adapted to suit the needs of the deaf.  The research reported in this paper is motivated by the view that  through the application of P&amp;A techniques, it will be possible to provide deaf students with equal access to  WWW-based educational resources.    Through the use of P&amp;A techniques and digital sign-language content, KSO aims to assist deaf students in the  individualised learning of sign language.  Within the system, the teacher is realised as a composer and tailor of  digital content that makes personalised digital video, textual descriptions and exercises available to students.  By  providing an adaptive WWW-based sign language education system, we hope to broaden the accessibility of  sign language learning materials.  Furthermore, we aim to illustrate how AH tools and techniques may be used to  address issues related to the education of the deaf in online learning environments.    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.  In section 2 we provide the motivations for our work in the  areas of educational AH systems and sign language systems.  Section 3 provides an overview of the Goldsmiths  Adaptive Hypermedia Model, which provides the framework and architecture for KSO.  In section 4, we  describe how the system dynamically generates personalisable educational sign language material.  Section 5  describes how P&amp;A features of KSO are implemented, and how they are made available to students.  This  section also describes features that enable students to search for personalised video content and describes the  assessment subsystem used to provide students with exercises to assess their learning.  Section 6 provides a brief  overview of additional features that are found within KSO.  These are an online sign language dictionary and  digital video fairytale stories.  Section 7 highlights related work and compares it to the work contributed by this  paper.  Finally, section 8 contains conclusions and future directions for research.      Background and Motivations    The potential for using AH systems to address issues of learning has long been recognised (Beaumont I &amp;  Brusilovsky P, 1995; Brusilovsky P et al, 1996).  The predominant application area has been education (Kay J &amp;  Kummerfeld R J, 1994; Brusilovsky P et al, 1996; De Bra P, 1997; De Bra P, 1998).  Early lab-based systems,  such as these, were concerned with how AH techniques could be applied in an educational context.  With the  emergence of large-scale distributed hypermedia systems, such as the WWW, many online AH educational  systems have been proposed (Weber G &amp; Specht M, 1997; Steinacker A et al, 1998; Brusilovsky P, 1999; Stern  M K &amp; Woolf B P, 2000; Ng M H et al, 2002).  Broadly, all these systems have a similar goal: to provide  features that allow users to personalise, or have the system adapt, digital educational content.  P&amp;A features  implemented by systems include: link hiding and annotation (Culver &amp; De Bra P, 1997; Kay J&amp; Kummerfeld B,  1995), the incorporation of visual clues to assist learners (Brusilovsky P &amp; Pesin L, 1995), the tailoring of  content and its presentation (Specht &amp; Oppermann, 1998; Ng M H et al, 2002), selective content (Ohene-Djan J  &amp; Fernandes AAA, 2002), and tailoring options for traversal through the inclusion of additional supplementary  links (De Bra P &amp; Calvi I, 1998).  A review of recent AH concepts and issues can be found in (Brusilovsky P,  2001).    In this paper, we define personalisation to be the user-initiated tailoring of hyperdocuments.  Adaptivity is  defined to be system-driven personalisation.    In order to understand how AH research can benefit the design of sign language educational systems, it is first  useful to consider some of the reading, writing and teaching issues associated with the education of the deaf.   Historically, deaf children were only taught to lip-read and speak (Fischer R &amp; Lane H, 1993).  As a result of  their impediment, the reading levels of the deaf are generally of a lower standard than those of their hearing  counterparts (Schleper D R &amp; Mahshie S N, June 1997).  Furthermore, those who are taught sign language as  their primary mode of communication are potentially further disadvantaged when reading printed books or  WWW-based textual content.    87  </page> <page sequence="3">  A sign language is not a word-by-word translation of a spoken language, but is a language in its own right.  Sign  languages, such as American Sign Language (Sternberg M L, 1996) and British Sign Language (Sutton-Spence  R &amp; Woll B, 1999), differ significantly in their syntax and semantics from American or British English.  Therefore, the relationship between written English and sign language is very different from the relationship  between written English and spoken English. Written English is a foreign language to native speakers of sign  languages. In sign languages movements, body positions and expressions are integral parts of the syntax.  These  do not easily translate to written texts.  Furthermore, printed text often uses phraseology and grammatical  constructs that make word by word translation difficult, if not impossible (Coleman J R &amp; Wolf E E, 1991).  As  a result, printed text must nearly always be translated, by the teacher, into sign language, on behalf of the  student, in real time.  This process is expensive in terms of time and teaching resources and requires a high level  of expertise.    One approach to making printed, or WWW-based, educational materials accessible to deaf children is to  establish a pictorial representation of the vocabulary and syntax of a sign language. These representations are  called writing systems (Sutton V, 1996). Specifically, sign language writing systems use a set of visually  designed symbols that record how people sign, thereby representing the visual subtleties of sign language.  Although several proposals for sign language writing systems have been made (Sutton V, 1997), and tentative  steps have been taken towards providing software-based sign language translators such as the SignWriting  Markup Language, SWML (da Rocha Costa A C, 2003), to allow for the automatic generation of electronic texts  written in sign language, there is still no universally accepted writing system for sign languages.     In the absence of a universally accepted writing system, video has emerged as the primary technological  platform used to present educational material to the deaf.  Signing books (Pragma, 2002) are video presentations  of textual material.  They are analogous to talking books for the blind.  In such books, a narrator is recorded on  videotape while signing the content of the book.  The signing may be complemented by subtitles and other visual  clues (i.e., graphics, animations, etc.).  As signing books are presented via video, they inherit the inherent  weaknesses of the medium.  Videotape is inefficient to navigate through: a user must linearly shuttle backwards  and forwards through the tape, as no direct access mechanism is available.  Furthermore, users are unable to  search for a specific phrase or topic.  There are no contextual links for browsing and no table of contents to  locate particular subjects.  Finally, videotape degrades with repeated use.  These weaknesses become particularly  evident when such books are used for educational purposes.    The deficiencies in videotape technology are a motivating factor for our use of hypermedia technologies as a  platform for the delivery of sign language learning materials.  The ability of hypermedia systems to make non- linear context based navigation available to users, through the inclusion of hyperlinks, and their ability to make  use of computational resources to dynamically manage content, suggests that this medium may be a more  appropriate delivery platform.  Furthermore, content accessible via hypermedia systems is stored digitally and is  therefore not subject to degradation through repeated use.    In the case of AH, we propose that users could benefit from possibilities, not only related to the medium, but to  the design of the software itself.  Adaptive hypermedia technologies are starting to prove effective in performing  information retrieval tasks when users have different information seeking goals and histories (Karagiannidis C et  al, 2001; Bajraktarevic N et al, 2003). The ability of these techniques to tailor the content made available on an  individual basis and the ability to adapt this content to the specific knowledge that a user has of a subject could  yield similar advantages to the deaf learner.  Furthermore, the ability of adaptive hypermedia systems to tailor  link presentation, in order to direct and assist users in their online learning, appears to make adaptive hypermedia  techniques and technologies good candidates for use in the development of sign language education systems.      KSO Electronic Book Framework and Systems Architecture    In this section, we outline our view of electronic books, and provide an overview of the Goldsmiths Adaptive  Hypermedia Model.  This formal model was used as the systems architecture in the design of the KSO adaptive  electronic book.    In this paper, we define the content of an Electronic Book (E-book) to be a hyperlinked network of digital  information units.  When these information units are rendered, they provide the user with optional links to other  information units.  A rendering unit in an E-book is viewed as a hyperpage, and a collection of units as a  hypermedia presentation.  Such presentations are accessible via a WWW-browser (e.g., Galeon, Firebird,  88  </page> <page sequence="4"> Internet Explorer, etc.).  More generally, an E-book is viewed as an electronic version of a paperback book,  whose digital content may be dynamically generated.  This content is made accessible via the Internet, and is  read using an E-book reader, such as a WWW-browser.  In the case of KSO, an E-book reader is limited to be  any device that is capable of displaying a WWW-page.    Although there have been many impressive proposals for the development of E-book technologies (Harrison B  L, 2000; Press L, 2000; Ohene-Djan J &amp; Fernandes A A A, 2003). and much research has been conducted into  their deployment (Landoni et al, 2000a) and design (Landoni et al, 2000b; Landoni et al, 2000c; Landoni et al,  2001) a significant limitation of many WWW-based E-books is their inability to address users information needs  on an individual basis.  For example, when a user interacts with a paper-based book, they are given the  opportunity not only to read its content in a linear manner, but also to annotate it, insert and delete content, and  to make, in context, cross references to parts of the book and other books.  Such functionality is rarely found in  E-books using the WWW and is a further motivating factor for the research reported in this paper.  The KSO  homepage is shown in Figure 1.        Figure 1. The KSO Homepage      An Overview of the Goldsmiths Adaptive Hypermedia Model (GAHM)    The Goldsmiths Adaptive Hypermedia Model (GAHM) (Ohene-Djan J, 2000), (Ohene-Djan J &amp; Fernandes A A  A, 2000; Ohene-Djan J 2002; Ohene-Djan J and Fernandes A A A, 2002a) is a formal characterisation of  personalisation and adaptation within hypermedia systems.  Its originality lies in its formal specification of  personalisable, adaptive hypermedia, when loosely coupled to user interface and database servers.  Induced from  a formal definition of hypermedia specifications, used for the presentation of digital content, is a formal model of  hypermedia personalisation and adaptation.    The model defines a rich set of user initiated personalisation actions, which enable individual users to  personalise how information seeking tasks are performed.  This is then extended with additional functionality to  allow for the specification of a user model and decision making algorithm.  These additional components allow  for adaptivity to be realised.  In GAHM, personalisation is viewed as the process of handing over to the user the  ability to take actions to tailor hyperpages, thereby overriding aspects of a hyperpage’s content and presentation.   Adaptivity is viewed as the process of allowing the system to take the initiative in tailoring actions in the light of  its inference of a user’s information seeking goals and history.  In GAHM, adaptivity is, therefore, as expressive  as personalisation, but requires the addition of user modelling and decision making technologies.      Architecture of KSO    Figure 2 depicts the open architecture for hypermedia systems (this, and all subsequent figures use classical  UML notation), upon which KSO has been designed and implemented.  This architecture reflects the  89  </page> <page sequence="5"> predominant approach to the design of WWW-based hypermedia systems.  A core of AH functionality is viewed  as a client technology of one or more user interface and database servers (UISs and DBSs, respectively).  In the  case of KSO, the UISs are WWW-browsers, such as Galeon, Firebird and Internet Explorer, and the DBS used is  PostGreSQL (Momjian B, 2001).  The personalisation functionality implemented in KSO is represented by the  shaded package.        Figure 2. A General, Open Architecture for WWW-Based Hypermedia      Broadly, once a request has been captured, from a user, for a hyperpage, it is channelled directly into the core of  AH functionality.  If the request is simply for a hyperpage to be shown, the core responds by composing a  hyperpage specification and then rendering its digital content into a hypermedia presentation that can be  displayed by a UIS.  This composition process includes the querying of the PostGreSQL DBS, in order to fetch  references to digital content.  In KSO, hypermedia presentations consist of signing video clips, textual  descriptions and assessment exercises.  Other requests allow users to tailor hyperpage specifications and thereby  personalise their hypermedia presentations.  Such personalisation requests utilise meta-data, in the form of  annotations, which provide semantics for the content of hypermedia presentations.      Hypermedia Presentations within KSO    A hypermedia presentation is defined to be a collection of hyperpages, whose topology enables navigation  between them.  Within KSO, hyperpages are dynamically generated from hyperpage specifications.  A  hyperpage specification specifies a sequence of information units, known as chunks.  Chunks contain digital  content, such as video clips, text and graphics.  Each chunk is comprised of a specification of its content and a  specification of how to present (or render) this content.  Content specifications may be comprised of the content  itself (as is the case with many of the textual descriptions in KSO) or a reference, in the form of an SQL query,  that, when executed, evaluates into content, as is the case with the signing digital video clips available in KSO.        Figure 3. The Structure of a Hyperpage      Rendering specifications define how the digital content, defined by a content specification, is to be presented by  a UIS.  They take the form of a formal text in a language that the UIS can render (e.g., HTML).  There is a  binding between the two specifications, which is achieved by interdispersing the renderable text with variables  that reference the digital content of the content specification.  90  </page> <page sequence="6">  Each chunk may be associated with a set of entry points and a set of exit points.  An entry point enables the  hyperpage where the chunk occurs to be referenced in a request.  An exit point enables the chunk to establish a  navigable link to a hyperpage denoted by the exit point.  In WWW parlance, an entry point can be thought of as  a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), or as an anchor within a hyperpage, and an exit point as a hyperlink, e.g., an  &lt;A HREF&gt; tag in HTML.  The structure of a hyperpage is shown in Figure 3.  A possible rendering of the chunk  specification, for which a formal language has been defined (Ohene-Djan J, 2000), is shown in Figure 4.        Figure 4. A possible rendering of a Hyperpage Specfication      Dynamically Generating Hypermedia Presentations    When a user issues a request to view a hypermedia presentation via a UIS, the KSO system generates it by  retrieving, in sequence, each of the hyperpage specifications for that presentation from a data store, referred to as  a hyper-library (see Figure 5).  A composition function then parses each hyperpage specification into a set of  instructions that, when interpreted, assemble that part of the presentation as a renderable text.  This interpretation  process involves fetching digital content specified as an SQL query to the PostGreSQL DBS. Once this digital  content is returned it is woven, using the binding mechanism of variables, into a renderable text.  Once each  hyperpage specification in the sequence has been composed the completed hypermedia presentation is returned  to the UIS, which issued the original request.  Figure 5 illustrates the dynamic generation of hypermedia  presentations.  A formal model and associated semantics for the specification, and dynamic generation, of  hyperpages can be found in Ohene-Djan J, 2000).  Figure 6 shows an example of a hypermedia presentation  containing assessment exercises in KSO.         Figure 5. Dynamic Generation of Hypermedia Presentations      91  </page> <page sequence="7">    Figure 6. A Test in KSO      Personalising Hypermedia Presentations    In KSO, the requests a user can issue to personalise hypermedia presentations are based on the annotating and  rewriting of hyperpage specifications.  An annotation pairs a hyperpage specification with notes of interest.   These notes assign user-specific values to user-generic attributes of interest (e.g., The level of difficulty is high,  the presentation medium is video, etc.).  The existence of annotations allows for the personalisation of a  specified chunk, a hyperpage, or a complete hypermedia presentation.  Annotations are meta-data that describe  the content and/or behaviour of a hyperpage or its component parts.    In KSO, both hyperpages and their associated annotations are stored in the hyperlibrary.  The hyperlibrary is  implemented as a database (using the PostGreSQL relational database management system), comprised of  relations over the relational schemas for hyperpages and hyperpage annotations.  Further details on the  modelling of the hyperlibrary can be found in (Ohene-Djan J, 2000).      Personalisation Engine    We view personalisation as the process of handing over to the user the ability to take actions to tailor hyperpages  and, therefore, hypermedia presentations.  The personalisation engine is initially set using a static user-model  (Fischer G, 2000), which is a representation of a user’s knowledge of sign language knowledge.  This is initially  set, as a result of a student’s answers to a series of sign language exercises, when a user first registers with the  system.  This user model provides the means for a user to feed preferences into the personalisation engine.   These details are then used to tailor which hypermedia content is made available for further personalisation by  the user.    Personalisation in KSO is implemented as a software mechanism that is responsible for providing the  functionality required to tailor hypermedia presentations.  Such tailoring causes a personalised version of a  hypermedia presentation to be created.  The dynamics of the personalisation mechanism may be understood as  follows.  The personalisation process starts when a user issues a personalisation request, via a UIS, to KSO.  A  personalisation request is comprised of a scope, which denotes the collection of hyperpages in the hyperlibrary  for which the request should apply, and an action list, containing the tailoring actions to be executed over the  scope. The interface used to issue such requests is shown in Figures 7 and 8.  The example personalisation  request shown in Figure 7 may be represented in natural language as “I wish to be presented with all pages that  contain the string ‘1997’; subsequently delete the second chunk of each of these pages.”  Figure 8 can be  represented as “I wish to be presented with all pages in the hyperlibrary.  Of these pages, only keep those that  contain the string ‘1998’ in the second chunk.”    92  </page> <page sequence="8"> On receiving this request, the composer and tailoring engine parses it to determine which hyperpages should be  personalised and how, thereby generating a personalisation program.  In the case of KSO, this program is a  sequence of SQL statements, which are subsequently executed over the content of the hyperlibrary, thereby  realising a state transition, in the hyperlibrary, that reflects the intended meaning of the personalisation request.            Figure 7. Personalisation Request #1          Figure 8. Personalisation Request #2      KSO signing dictionary and fairytales    During preliminary research conducted in conjunction with the British Deaf Association (BDA), Frank Barnes  (Barnes, 2003) school for the deaf and Hawkswood (Hawkswood, 2003) School for the deaf it became apparent  that there is a significant lack of BSL online dictionaries for deaf children.  Furthermore, there are few  educational materials, in the form of digital video content, that address the learning needs of children under the  age of ten years available via the WWW.  As a result of these observations, it was decided that KSO would be  designed to be bi-lingual (i.e., supporting the education of English as well as BSL) and would incorporate an  online dictionary for the deaf and educational materials targeted towards children under the age of ten.      KSO Signing Dictionary    Although the BDA is currently working on the development of a large scale British dictionary for sign language,  this dictionary is targeted at deaf adults.  KSO incorporates an online dictionary that has been designed primarily  for use by children.  The KSO dictionary (Shown in Figure 9, 10, 11 and 12) enables a child to select a letter of  the alphabet or chose a category (i.e., Animals, Food etc).  As a result of this action the KSO displays a  hypermedia presentation comprised of a selection of words which are within that category or which begin with  the letter chosen, together with associated digital video, signing each word.  Figures 9, 10, 11 and 12 show  examples of the KSO online dictionary in operation      93  </page> <page sequence="9">    Figure 9. KSO’s Online Dictionary        Figure 10. KSO’s Online Dictionary        Figure 11. KSO’s Online Dictionary    94  </page> <page sequence="10">    Figure 12. KSO’s Signing Dictionary      Signing fairytales    A key feature in the design strategy for KSO was that the system’s content, as far as possible, reflected the  learning needs of deaf children up to the age of 10.  Therefore, a decision was made that educational materials, in  the form of assessment exercises, would be supplemented by further materials that facilitated discovery-based  learning and general browsing for this age group.  An example of this is the inclusion of a section comprised of  classical children’s fairy tales, in the form of signed digital video.  It was felt that such content was important  because it reflected the type of learning materials offered to hearing children of this age group.  Each fairy tale is  presented as both textual descriptions and signed digital video.  An example of a fairy tale as a hypermedia  presentation is given in Figure 13.        Figure 13. Fairy Tales in KSO      Related Work    This section compares and contrasts the work reported here with that of other online sign language learning  resources and that of AH systems in general.  It is in no way exhaustive, but aims to give the reader a sense of  where future technological developments may lie.  As stated in the Background and Motivations section, the vast  95  </page> <page sequence="11"> majority of deaf learning materials are paper, or videotape (Allsop L &amp; Mason C), based.  Some work has been  done on WWW-based learning materials for the deaf (Deafchild International; Lapiak J A, 1996; Gaertner S,  2003).  Although these systems are valuable educational resources, they do not address users on an individual  basis.  Instead, they provide all users with the same information, regardless of an individual user’s ability, or  knowledge.    The KSO system utilises digital video clips to represent sign language in the digital domain.  Recent research  efforts have aimed to incorporate 3D animations of signers in contrast to video.  Vsign (Vsign, 2003), part of the  MultiReader project (www.multireader.org), is a project consisting of a builder to create 3D animated avatars  that perform sign language motions, together with a player for such avatars.  The Vsign builder allows users to  build animations from a model of a human.  Users may specify the complete range of body movements used in  sign language.  However, it is still not possible to include facial expressions.  VisiCast (Visicast, 2003) is a  project to develop a 3D model of a signing person to accompany subtitles and teletext information on digital  television.  Signs are digitally captured via advanced technologies, including a body suit and digital helmet.  The  VisiCast system is an extension of earlier work on the development of “Simon”, a prototype system that signed  in English, as opposed to BSL.  Although the VisiCast system uses 3D animations, these are displayed in 2D  form for performance reasons.      Vcom3D (www.signingavatar.com) is currently developing leading edge software for the teaching of reading to  the deaf.  Their signing avatars, developed using 3D Studio (Murdock K, 2001), allow users to choose the  perspective and signing speed.  A particular point of note is Vcom3D’s ultimate goal; to develop a machine  translation system that will take a website and output an animated, signed website.    Although the authors of this paper accept that 2D representations may not completely represent all aspects of  human signing that may be captured by a 3D model, it was felt that the benefits associated with digital video  outweighed the costs associated with the construction of a 3D model.  In particular, the use of digital video  enabled KSO to show digital signing presentations by deaf children to deaf children.  This, it was felt, is an  important aspect of learning by example.  The capture of digital video is, at present, relatively cheap in terms of  time and cost, compared with that required to produce, and subsequently animate, 3D characters, such as those  used by Vcom3D, VisiCast, and Vsign.  Furthermore, the use of digital video, in contrast to 3D animations,  enabled KSO to be available to a wide base of users, many of whom we found, during preliminary research, did  not have the latest internet technologies available to them (i.e., up to date players, such as Flash and Shockwave,  and the high performance hardware required to support these players).    KSO’s use of digital video in the development of sign language dictionaries may be compared to that taken by  the Personal Communicator (http://commtechlab.msu.edu/index.php), a CDROM-based ASL dictionary.   Originally developed using Hypercard (Goodman D, 1998) at Michigan State University, this, now  commercially available, software makes available to users over 2500 signs as digital video clips.  In addition to  ASL, the Personal Communicator also provides English synonyms.  The Personal Communicator, now  developed using Macromedia Director, is available for both the Macintosh and Windows platforms.    The personalisation features of KSO are similar to those made available by implemented AH systems such as  Adaptive Hyperman (Mathe N &amp; Chen J, 1996), Joint Zone (Ng M H et al, 2002), and the AHA (De Bra P &amp;  Calvi L, 1998).  These personalisation features include customisation via a static user model, the insertion and  deletion of digital content, and the ability to express searches which result in tailored hypermedia presentations.   Since the GAHM (Ohene-Djan J, 2000), the formal model upon which KSO is based, characterises a complete  set of possibilities for personalisation actions on WWW-based hyperdocuments, it is possible to implement all  P&amp;A actions described in (Brusilovsky P, 1996) and many of those described in (Brusilovsky P, 2001).  It is  envisaged that in future versions of KSO a broader range of P&amp;A actions will be implemented.    A significant difference between KSO and other AH systems is its application domain, namely sign language  education for deaf children.   Due to KSO’s application domain, its design incorporates several usability features  not generally found in AH systems.  For example, KSO allows children to customise their interface, in terms of  colours and fonts.  It also enables children to personalise pages with the child’s chosen identity.    Finally, the design aspects of the hypermedia presentations contained within KSO, and their usability features,  are derived in part, and shared by those of (Landoni et al, 2000b).  However, in KSO, we use personalisation as a  value added strategy, in contrast to, for example, visual clues (Landoni et al, 2000c).      96  </page> <page sequence="12"> Conclusions    To date, relatively little work has been directed towards providing online educational resources for the deaf,  although the WWW is now a major source of educational information for the hearing.  We believe, that for deaf  children to have quality education throughout their lives, information contained within the WWW must be  tailored to address their accessibility needs.  The research reported in this paper is motivated by the view that,  through the application of P&amp;A techniques, it may be possible to provide deaf students with equal access to  WWW-based educational resources.      In this paper, we present KSO, a personalisable electronic book for the teaching of British Sign Language to deaf  children and their tutors.  The novelty of KSO is that it incorporates advanced P&amp;A techniques into the  development of a WWW-based electronic book.  Through the use of the P&amp;A techniques employed during the  development of KSO, we aim to broaden the accessibility of online sign language learning materials.  In this  paper, we have illustrated how, through a combination of digital video, textual descriptions and assessment  exercises, it is possible to devise an individualised learning environment for the deaf.      KSO is a demonstration system, whose architecture is based upon a complete formalisation of P&amp;A actions in  hypermedia systems. We aim, through future development, to test the effectiveness of various P&amp;A actions in  the application area of deaf online learning.
