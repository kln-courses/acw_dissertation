Many ordinary Senufo farmers have never seen such figures and do not even know of their existence. The pounders were ritual objects of a small subgroup of artisans that recently converted to Islam, and even the figures that did exist in some rural villages were often stolen and not replaced. Although rhythm pounders were not secret objects, they were hidden, not part of everyday life. In this article, I examine how these rhythm pounders were embedded in ritual actions. I describe one specific celebration that I documented in the 1980s, thus I adopt the past tense in this particular description. SCULPTING A RHYTHM POUNDER Only a few carvers specialize in rhythm pounders, and their oeuvre is often fairly small. Hence, the pounders are often associ- ated with other anthropomorphic figures, in particular those used by the ordinary Senufo, the farmers, for funerary rituals. Indeed, both types resemble each other to such a degree that a correct identification has to be based on traces of its use: the wooden figures of the Senufo were employed standing upright at or near the place where most funerary rituals took place. They often rotted where they touched the ground, thus showing damage at the base.2 On the other hand, rhythm pounders were mobile and used only during the burial itself, when they were held specially at the arms, or otherwise at the neck, or shoulders, and thus show traces of sweat and sometimes have a deep shiny patina at the upper arms. Both types might be carved with a strong and massive base, although the more recent figures of the farmers often have a lighter one, no more than a few centimeters high, while the base of a rhythm pounder nor- mally had twenty to twenty- five centimeters. Sometimes the pounder had longer upper arms to make it easier to handle, but that alone is not sufficient to identify an anthro- pomorphic figure as a rhythm pounder. Such tall anthropomorphic figures were made by carvers who, among the Senufo, belong to an endogamous artisan group, the Kulibele.3 The Kulibele settle in quarters of their own within the ordinary Senufo vil- lages. Until recently, sculptors worked more or less in the framework of their lineage. An outsider often would not know who among the Kulibele had specialised in a particular Rhythm Pounder, Senufo, Mali.

A customer therefore addressed the spokesman of the quarter first; that person would then pass the order on to a sculptor known to be best in that genre. The sculptor started by choosing the right wood. A hard and durable wood was the best choice for these heavily handled figures. If a good tree trunk was found, the sculptor would outline the proportions of the figure with a few strokes of his adze (fig. 1). Carved as a pair, the second figure followed the model of the first. The sculptor then worked out the rough shape of the figure, still using an adze with a fairly wide blade. He used a small knife only for carving the details, in particular the eyes and other facial features. The surface was smoothed with a bundle of hard leaves and then dyed black. An ordinary sculptor needed about two weeks to finish a rhythm pounder. If he specialised in anthropomorphic figures and if he had no other obligations, he could do it within a week. In more rural settlements, a Kulibele master who had specialised in tall anthropo- morphic figures would do three or four pairs within a decade. During the second half of the twentieth century, the number of com- missions declined significantly. Patronage first increased as thefts obliged many village elders to order more such figures, but when the purchase of more and more figures became a heavy burden, patronage faded rapidly. Nowadays, few sculptors still pro- duce for the local market, and most figures are made for international customers. Rhythm pounders, mainly produced for a small artisan group that subsequently con- verted to Islam in recent decades, have become more rare than ordinary figures. THE CELIBELE AS AN ARTISAN GROUP AMONG THE SENUFO Although rhythm pounders are carved by members of the Kulibele, they are almost exclusively owned by a small artisan group, the Celibele. The Celibele settle in quarters separated from the ordinary Senufo, who are 56</page><page sequence="4">farmers, and do not mix with other artisan groups. They are of Manding origin and once spoke a Manding dialect close to the ones in the region around Mankono and Séguéla, from where they migrated into cen- tral and western Senufoland. When they arrived in the nineteenth century, the Celi- bele came as jeli, who are known as bards performing praise songs and celebrating the famous epics of the medieval empire of Mali.4 Unlike their relatives further north, they were not Muslims and were seldom pro- fessional musicians. They came with a secret society of their own, the Lo or Do, which was later called Poro - like the secret society of the Senufo.5The Celibele brought several masks that had not existed among the Senufo until then. They were soon appropriated by the farmers. For example, they brought the Korubla, now known as "typical Senufo." Most Celibele made a living as rope makers and tanners, selling leather, shoes, ropes, and other products in local markets. By the mid-twentieth century, however, most of the Celibele settlements in northern Côte d'Ivoire no longer practiced their own lan- guage and had adopted many elements of culture from the majority of Senufo farmers surrounding them. In the 1980s, only some elder men remembered a few words of the particular Manding their grandparents had practiced. If they spoke Manding, they were more fluent in the ordinary Jula that serves as a market language all over Côte d'Ivoire. At the time and during the 1990s, many Celibele settlements converted to Islam, reinventing the culture of the jeli that they once had been. In remote areas where the influence of Islamic learning was less strong, some Celi- bele still followed their particular lifestyle. Tyelikaha, more or less isolated in a region where almost all roads ended, was one such area. The rope makers of the hamlet once had tried to settle among the Senufo in the neighbouring village of Nafoun. As they were not allowed to settle there, they built their houses next to a narrow stream bor- dered by dense vegetation. It was there, too, where the Celibele cleared the wilderness for their initiation center, the sacred grove. The groves of the Celibele were always small and so were their age sets. By the late twentieth century, an ordinary Celibele neighborhood was seldom composed of more than one minimal lineage and may have numbered some seventy-five to one hundred members, women and children included. It was never easy to bring enough young men together to form an age set of a size that would allow them to perform the mourning rituals. One needed at least ten to twelve able men who would carry the burden of paying the heavy fees of the Poro, working for the old initi- ates - or simply "for the grove," as many call it, repairing the masks and their costumes, maybe ordering new ones, and performing the many other duties that a member of Poro had to fulfil. The elders of Tyelikaha there- fore adopted the same initiation cycle as in Nafoun, allowing them to ask for ritual sup- port if needed. In fact, most members of the farmers' Poro had to pass the sacred grove of the Celibele for a few days and assisted them during the most important rites, in particular the funerals that transformed an old member of Poro into an ancestor. As usual, such part- nerships were reciprocal, and Celibele had access to many farmers' groves as well. Burials and commemorative funerals were indeed a heavy burden for the entire artisan settlement, members and uninitiated women and children alike. The entire hamlet as well as guests from other villages and Celi- bele communities had to be offered a "good meal" - that is, rice or yams with meat or at least fish if there was not enough meat for all. That meant that one had to slaughter some if not most of the goats and sheep in the compound. When an elder died, killing a cow or two was inevitable. In addition, every guest was provided with as much millet beer as he or she liked, so that the giant pots in which the beer was boiled were put on the fire in all compounds and the smell of the beer filled the air. Because the 57</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 2. During the burial of an elder ropemaker, rhythm pounders are often brought to the corpse when the more public ritual is about to end. Although the following procedures are not secret, younger uninitiated women are not expected to participate unless they belong to the family of the deceased person. Photo: Till Förster, Tyelikaha, 1986. rites and ceremonies of an ordinary burial lasted for three or four days, the guests coming from afar needed a place to sleep, too. A commemorative funeral was even more challenging. Such an event was organ- ised once in a decade or so to remember all deceased persons of the past few years and to reconfirm their status as ancestors. Such commemorative funerals could take an entire week and often needed a year of preparation. Burials and funerals weren't only an occa- sion to mourn and remember those who had died; they were also an occasion to meet rela- tives one had not seen for years. They were events that attracted musicians and dance troupes from all over the region. When ritual 58</page><page sequence="6">partnership to other groves existed, those groves would send their initiates, who would perform with their masks and ritual dances. In the case of burials, public performances usually dominated the first day, when the deceased person was still lying in his house, wrapped in white cloth and guarded by rela- tives chasing the flies. In the grove, the initi- ates prepared for the performances to come. Two or three of them came to the kpaala, the wooden shelter of the Poro society in the village, and lit a fire, thus signaling that the members of the secret society were active and preparing for the rites. The exact time schedule for their performances was often a question of debate among the older initiates, however, for every grove had its own and cooperation meant that one had to negotiate a frame for all performances to come. In what follows I describe one specific celebratory event that I witnessed between February 27 and March 2, 1986, in which the rhythm pounders were used. Late at night during the first or second day of the event, as a group of young girls were dancing to the accompaniment of musicians for the public, an initiate came running to them and threw a burning torch on the ground. This was the formal start of the first rites performed at the kpaala. The musicians immediately stopped playing. Elder men and women slowly began to arrive and silently watch the younger initi- ates perform in an act called by everyone the "work of Poro" or the "work of the old" referring to their obligation to organise and perform on any occasions marking the trans- formation of an elder into an ancestor. The initiates sang in their secret language about what they had experienced during their seclusion in the forest grove throughout the initiation period, and how they had learned that they had to support the elders and each other. Although the performance itself was open to the public, it was not considered particularly beautiful or creative, and it did not attract the young people. It had to follow a scheme of actions that best celebrated the ethics of reciprocity and work that are fun- damental to the Poro as an institution inte- grating the various segments of society. RHYTHM POUNDERS AT CELIBELE BURIALS The second day was the day of the burial itself. Most people slept in the morning, because they had been dancing and drinking most of the night. At about noon or in the early afternoon, the corpse of the deceased was brought out of his house. Elder mem- bers of Poro had arranged the cloths that the mourning relatives had received as gifts of condolence in layers in the middle of the courtyard. The corpse was then laid down on the cloth, and musicians of the deceased's village started to play. Among the farmers, it was an ensemble of four to five xylophones, one bass, and two or three smaller kettle drums. Such xylophone ensembles always opened the event if the Celibele settlement belonged to an ordinary Senufo village. Artisan groups had their own instruments, however. The Celibele at this ceremony were performing with one or two small kettle drums, an iron slit gong, and with a double- sided, hourglass-shaped drum called a tam- agbinge. The tamagbinge is carried under the left shoulder, and by pressing the arm against the ropes holding the skin, one can alter its pitch. It was used as a talking drum, repro- ducing the pitch of known spoken phrases, although not during the more public parts of the ceremonies. Soon after the music started, musicians from other villages and artisan groups joined in and dancers quickly filled the courtyard while the old men who had carried the corpse out of the house started to sew the cloth around the body. This was the first stage of the burial. All relatives were expected to join in the dance around the old men sewing silently in the middle; not to dance would have been an offense to the lineage. In gen- eral, if the deceased person was a man, his wife would lament her loss by singing songs particularly composed for that occasion, songs that were narratives about the life and 59</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 3.

Next to her, girls would dance to other rhythms, as quickly and gracefully as they could, encouraging the musicians to beat a faster tempo in an attempt to attract the glances of the young men surrounding them. The duration of this stage depended on the number of cloths that the lineage had received as gifts of condo- lence and therefore on the social status of the deceased person. If it was an elder, it could easily take the entire afternoon. Typically, when the corpse was wrapped and sewed in the last, usually splendid, cloth, the rites of Poro began. Women and uniniti- ated men would have to leave if the burial followed the rites of the farmers' Poro. In this Celibele ceremony, however, young men and even young boys were allowed to stay if they took off their shirts.7 The music of the profane xylophones stopped and the deep sound of the drums of Poro permeated the place where the older members of the secret society pushed spectators backward in order to have enough space for the masks to per- form. One or two elders suddenly showed up 60</page><page sequence="8">carrying two tall wooden figures, the rhythm pounders (fig. 2). The farmers who attended the rites called these figures Poro piibele, the "children of poro," while the rope makers had another name for them that the others wouldn't understand. When talking to a farmer, the rope makers spoke of doogele, which meant "pestle." It was clear that a thin line separated the initiated Celibele from the rest. The uninitiated farmers were allowed to attend the events, but they lacked a com- prehensive understanding of the ritual. The pounders were brought in so quickly that many of the bystanders missed the moment. The men laid them on the left and right sides of the corpse and immediately stepped back. Both figures were female. A moment later, several masked characters showed up. The masks all belonged to the type that only the Celibele possessed: they had a fat body entirely covered with ropes in red and earthy colours, sometimes comple- mented by green strings. The head was cov- ered by a knit black cap, and a shiny red crest surmounted the forehead. The masks were decorated with white feathers and cowry beads sewn on the tissue or tied into strings hanging in front of the invisible face of the dancer. More often than not, the Celi- bele called this mask simply their "heritage," for it so obviously referred to their profession as rope makers. When they were invited to participate in funerals of other artisan groups, they sent this mask. It was not secret, and many a farmer had already admired its fast and acrobatic dancing during commem- orative funerals - although there were ritual parts of its performance that women were not allowed to see (fig. 3). In the case of a Celibele burial, the mask didn't perform the same dance. It always appeared in pairs; one had a perfect costume, the other seemed to be a bit neglected. This disparity was intended: it stood for the suc- cessive generations that would take over from each other and renew the ritual equip- ment of the grove, the masks' costumes included. There was not much difference Fig. 4. A Korogo masked performer bows over the corpse, gently touching it with his flywhisk, while an initiate of the same age grade as the deceased person speaks through the mirliton. Photo: Till Förster, Tyelikaha, 1986. in the performance of the masks, however. They appeared when the deceased person was sewn into the condolence cloth and danced around the body. Representing the Celibele's heritage, the masks were accompa- nied by an elder who sang through a mirli- ton, a small tube covered on both sides by a spider's net. It transformed the singer's voice into a strange sound comprehensible only to those who had learned the tunes during their time as initiates in the grove. The crucial moment of this performance came when the two rhythm pounders were in place on both sides of the body. The mask bowed over the bundle of cloth from one side while the elder chanting through the mirliton did the same from the other side. As he continued to sing about the hardship of initiation, the masked 61</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 5. When the Korogo has performed, the wooden masked performers of the Poro society show up.

After having sewn some of the cloth that served as condolence gifts around the corpse, the elder initi- ates dance around their age mate, jumping at his feet and pointing to the ground with their forefingers. Photo: Till Förster, Tyelikaha, 1986. performer laid her flywhisk on the body, slowly turning it to the sound of the instru- ment of the elder in front (fig. 4). As the audience watched silently, only a few older men were heard commenting on some details of the mask's costume. The rite was then repeated by the second mask. The irritating sound of iron bars clacking on tubes also made of iron interrupted the scene, a signal that the principal mask of the secret society, simply called "the Poro" by the bystanders, would soon appear. A few seconds later, most people were stiffly watch- ing the first mask that appeared between the houses, approaching the place by moving in zigzags, as if the mask were searching for something. One or two of the elders then went and opened a pathway for the mask, occasionally guiding it by turning the dancer toward the dead body on the ground. It was the Poro of the grove where the deceased had been initiated decades ago. Green leaves were attached to the wooden head, itself a compo- sition of several wild animals. As the mask entered the circle, it started to move faster, dancing around the corpse on the ground, sometimes stepping between the men in attendance. The older men sometimes com- mented on what they saw, saying that the dancer should pay attention not to fall or to hit someone. Such an error would have been a bad sign for the burial rites and could render the entire ritual useless: the deceased would not have been transformed correctly into an ancestor. Younger men didn't say much, and boys of about ten or twelve years at times appeared to be in pain and some of them left. They had experienced masks running through the village late in the night and beating uninitiated boys, and they didn't know if this particular mask would do the same. The wooden mask wasn't clearly visible, for it nearly disappeared beneath the long, freshly cut light-green leaves. A young man accompanied the dancer with a bundle of leaves that could immediately replace the ones on the mask if they fell on the ground 62</page><page sequence="10">during the performance. When it moved, one could barely recognise the snout and strong teeth of a wild animal, maybe of a hyena or even a crocodile; and long, pointed ears appeared between the leaves when the mask bowed forward. A bundle of porcupine spines and other material rose up on the crown of the mask. Raffia was attached around the neck of the dancer, while the rest of his body was hidden by a kind of jumpsuit in earthy colours. It took some time before the mask seemed to be ready to approach the dead body in the middle. One of the elder men pushed it a little bit by the shoulder, before the dancer kneeled down in front of the corpse. It was a moment of silence, inter- rupted only by the sound of the iron bars that a younger member of Poro continued to hit throughout the performance (fig. 5). The masked performer stood up again and moved slowly, but after turning around, he disappeared between the houses. Some members of the farmers' Poro society com- mented on the performance, for the masker didn't beat the drum that normally separated the components of a person during their rites - that is, body, shadow, and life-force. It was obvious that the artisan's burial fol- lowed a different schedule. Two of the elder Celibele started to dance, while two old men chanted through the mirliton that is nor- mally part of the ritual objects of another masked figure. The whole scene was super- vised by an old initiate of Poro who held a long whip in his hand, using it from time to time to keep spectators at distance. The dancers jumped around the recumbent dead body, sometimes shouting and crying. Some of the spectators laughed as they came closer and closer to the bundle of cloth, spreading their arms as if they were birds. Then the two dancers pointed to the ground, first at the sides of the body where the two rhythm pounders were still lying, then at the bottom of the bundle and at the feet of the deceased (fig. 6). A middle-aged member of Poro per- formed the next part of the ritual. He took Fig. 7. Tapping the drum over the corpse is an essen- tial ritual act. The way the drum is beaten guarantees that the deceased corpse will be treated according to the rules meant to ensure a safe way out of the village of the living.

Photo: Till Förster, Tyelikaha, 1986. the double-sided drum that was so well known to all initiated men and started to dance with it. He bent forward and his body was swinging from left to right and back. The drum was swinging with his body, describing a wide circle. He beat the drum when it flew from the left to the right and back. After having done so on both sides of the body, he danced back to where the other two men had pointed to the ground. But he didn't stop in front of the bundle; he jumped forward, standing with his legs spread wide right over the body, still swinging and beat- ing the drum. His feet nearly touched the two rhythm pounders on the ground. One of the two elder men chanting through the mirliton accompanied him while he slowly stepped forward, stepping upon and defiling the bundle with the corpse from bottom to top (fig. 7).8 The spectators watched the scene without uttering a word. PERFORMING WITH THE DOOGELE As the sun began to set over the trees in the west of the small village, some older men began to shout that the initiated younger members of Poro should hurry up. A corpse should be buried by sunset, they said, other- wise problems could arise. There was not much time left to bring the dead body to where the young men of the Celibele had dug a grave during the last two days of mourning. Eight members of the secret society carried the corpse on their shoulders and walked slowly on a narrow path that led to the graveyard at the western fringes of the hamlet. They were accompanied by the elders and other initiates, some of them walking in front of the corpse, "showing the deceased person the way," as they put it. The Celibele were playing a special drum that only they possessed, a small kettle drum whose body was made of clay. The men used a short stick to produce its peculiar sound. The drums weren't used by the farmers or by any other artisan group. There was more to the ceremony that most members of the farmers' Poro didn't know about. When the men left with the body, the elders of the Celibele took the tall wooden figures and pounded with them on the ground right in front of them, as if they were clearing a pathway for the deceased person. They began with small steps, pounding heavily, then accelerating with the setting sun and with the rhythm of the drums played by the men accompanying them (fig. 8). The masks showed up again. However, they weren't at the center of the ritual action. They were watching the scene from a place near the outlying houses of the hamlet. When the body arrived there, the men suddenly stopped, turning around with their load as if the deceased would look back to the village where he had spent his life. The bystanders murmured that this was a sign, a manifestation of the deceased's will that one of his younger brothers should take his place as head of the lineage. Others, however, said that it wasn't clear what he 64</page><page sequence="12">meant - but every move made by the men carrying the body was beyond their control and had to be interpreted as an action of the dead person. The old men pounding with the doogele stopped and waited on both sides of the path, waiting where the body would move next. Again, some of them shouted that the "work" should be done quickly now, as the sun was close to the horizon. A frame of three wooden poles was brought to lay the corpse upon (fig. 9). Then everybody acted very fast. While the men attached the body to the poles, the masked performers were kneeling down next to the body and hitting their drums (fig. 10). The old members of Poro then put the two rhythm pounders right on top of the bundle, while another elder pointed toward the graveyard, saying that there was no time to lose (fig. 11). The men took up the bundle and disappeared between the trees that surrounded the hamlet. Most of the others stayed where they were, except two or three old members of Poro who slowly followed those who carried the corpse. They would supervise the last act of the burial, making sure that no ritual rule was offended. Somewhere out there, somebody would take the two pounders and bring them secretly back to the grove where they were kept. RITUAL ECHOES The evening after the burial was calm. The guests were served their meals, while the Celibele of the village prepared for what was called "the watch." Nobody should sleep during the first night after the deceased person had left the village. One should be up celebrating him, remembering what he had done for his relatives, for his friends, for the entire settlement, and for the Celibele in general. All the musicians should perform, and dances should fill every courtyard of the hamlet. The feast started about two hours before midnight. Praise singers appeared and walked through every courtyard, singing about the deeds of a great man who was now Fig. 10. Initiates attach the corpse to the wooden frame while the elders watch.

A woman who had married into the deceased's family carried a long pole to which she had attached long ropes and narrow cotton strips to remind everybody that he had been a good ropemaker, a proper ^//-artisan. Somewhere a cousin of the deceased showed up with a huge yam on his head, demonstrating that the village had also lost a good farmer. Late at night a young initiate of Poro ran through the village, throwing bundles of burning straw into the middle of the court- yards where the musicians played. The musi- cians had to stop and wait until the secret society would allow them to continue. It was calm again, and only after some time human voices were heard from the Poro grove. The initiates said that nobody was allowed to approach the path that led from the grove to the kpaala, the wooden structure where the members of the secret society met in the vil- lage. Not even the eldest members of Poro 65</page><page sequence="13">Fig. ii. The two rhythm pounders are laid on the corpse one last time while an elder of the secret society points toward the graveyard.

Photo: Till Förster, Tyelikaha, 1986. were allowed to go there or have a look at what would follow- regardless of their posi- tion within the society and whether they had performed this rite themselves or not. There was only one way to witness it: to participate. Within the grove, initiated men prepared to perform one of the most secret rites of Poro. Many of them belonged to the age grade that was initiated recently, but others were respected elders who had passed initiation decades ago. They didn't talk much - everybody knew what to do. In the darkness beneath the giant trees of the grove, the men had a stock of wooden poles, not much longer than an ordinary pestle and the doogele that had been used during the day. Indeed, they had used them for another public performance of Poro, in particular 66</page><page sequence="14">for a singing contest required midway through the initiation cycle. During the night, however, the poles were used in quite a different way. The men formed a long queue, so close together that one could feel the breath of the man next to him on his neck. The first and the last had a mirliton through which they sang the songs of old, recalling the hardship that initiation meant to the deceased member of Poro. The men in the middle responded to every sentence by pounding with their poles on the ground, moaning heavily. They walked through the silent village, then sur- rounded the kpaala three times and returned to the grove. This was an eerie moment for the uninitiated, as the men's sound was like the deep grumbling of some enormous wild animal. For those who had participated in the rite before, it was an echo of the rite that took place during the day. Although only ordinary pestles were used here, and not the carved wooden rhythm pounders, the nightly rite still referred to the path the dead had to take. This performance indeed had to be experienced, not merely watched. After the queue had returned to the grove, an initiate came back to the musicians and the feast continued until daybreak. Although the younger initiates would still watch out at the kpaala and other rites of Poro would be performed during the days to come, the rhythm pounders would not be used again. The rite that had taken place ear- lier, deep in the night, might be performed years later at big commemorative funerals, but only if the dead person had become a good and benevolent ancestor, and his aid to the living was desired. i.

This is probably due to the small size of the Celibele settlements and the fact that their initiation cycles weren't as exclusive as those of the farmers. At the Celibele burials I witnessed, not all boys observed this prescription. 8.
