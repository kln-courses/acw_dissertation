DeWald U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Development Center ABSTRACT. Using the systems approach, the human factors engineer stands ready to assist the design engineer In providing the vehicle driver vitn an optimum workplace. A human factors checklist has been devised for the design engineer to alert him to the major areas where troubles for the human operator generally develop. This preliminary checklist has been applied to the design of a pickup truck cab to illustrate its use. The terms "average" and "percentile" are explained. Sources of human factors data are suggested where the design engineer may find specific information as to spatial requirements for U.S. adult men and women, automotive driver controls, driver seating, environmental considerations within the vehicle, including conditions of heat, cold, and high humidity, ventilation, noise, vibration, and vision capability. When a particular component or control is the subject of a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard*. the pertinents standard is identified by number and title. Maintenance and maintainability considerations are empha- sized, since all products must be repaired eventually. The- combination of good human factors engineerings and vehicles that are easy to repair can greatly improve public acceptance of the automotive design engineer's product. 228</page><page sequence="2">AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN is a wide field and has long been the preserve of the automotive design engi- neer whose training and experience has prepared him to think primarily in terms of "hardware . " His design may be intended to transmit power, change direction of forces, or modify materials, generally actions of a physical nature requiring conventional engineering design work, the kind of design he knows well. Many times the design engineer does not -ven realize that he has a "human factors 1 problem. This is because man is such an adaptable being that he has adjusted himself to the machine, rather than the other way around. If the machine were designed to fit the man, might not the en- tire man-machine system operate better as a whole? What part of the job can better be accom- plished by the man? What part by the machine? The answers to these questions come from a rela- tively new discipline called "human factors engineering. " This paper is addressed primarily to the general engineering audience to whom the con- cept of human factors is somewhat new. The paper intends to show the "hardware ' design engineer how he can benefit from this new dis- cipline, where he can find useful human factors data, and what the human factors engineer can do to assist the design engineer. SYSTEMS ENGINEERING The systems engineering approach to the philosophy of design is the engineering manage- ment technique whereby all aspects of a problem can be identified and solutions prcposed on che basis of how well the operator and the machine interact to form an integrated man-machine sys- tem - a smoothly operating whole. The "systems approach" encompasses three interrelated activities (Kavanau et al., 1971: p. 8-5): "The first aspect is the systems anal- ysis of a complex network of elements, either existing or planned. The second is a system engineering approach that is used creatively to develop an entirely new system or to modify an existing system in a planned and orderly way. The third activity, systems management, includes the functions and procedures necessary to operate an existing system o.r to- accomplish the development of a new system." The systems engineering activity is the phase that concerns the design engineer. By the time he gets his assignment, the systems analy- sis phase has generally been completed and the preferred solution has been determined by higher authority. Ideally, the design engineer would prefer to be involved in the earlier systems analysis phase and contribute his knowledge toward analyzing the customer's requirements, proposing solutions, evaluating the solutions for feasibility (i.e., are these proposed solutions practical?), and then assist in selecting the most practical solution from the possible candi- dates. In practice, though, decisions as to the optimum solutions have already been made, and the designer must "live with" ready-made solutions that may not have been correctly analyzed from the human factors point of view. This is why the designer needs the assistance of the human fac- tors engineer to work out the optimum design which is the best possible compromise among man's limitations, the machine's capabilities, and the cost. HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING A typical human factors engineer is usually well experienced in engineering design. He has then expanded his "hardware-oriented" background to include study of the human beings who will operate or use the hardware • - additional sub- jects such as physiology, psychology, and anthropometry. He not only knows how to design and build operationally reliable equipment, but also how to insure that the man or woman who runs the equipment can do so as efficiently and as safely as possible. The human factors engineer is thoroughly familiar with the many constraints that are placed on the designer as a iirect result of using man as a working component in the overall system. Van Cott and Warrick (1972:34, 37) point out that "These problems and constraints result from the physical and behavioral variations among men, the structural and functional limitations of the body, the requirements for man's safety and comfort, and the need to maintain his physiolog- ical functions." The designer produces the best design he can conceive, based on the information he has at. , hand. When he is applying human factors criteria to his design, he is working in a field outside his own expertise. Thus, there can be human factors problems pertinent to his design that he may not recognize, because of his necessarily strong orientation towards hardware. He needs assistance in orienting the man into the man- machine combination. 229</page><page sequence="3">230 M. H. ALEXANDER AND R. E. DeWALD HUMAN FACTORS CHECKLIST Appendix A shows a preliminary checklist for the designer to use as a guide to alert him- self to the major areas where troubles for the human operator generally develop. The check- list Includes human engineering items to consider when designing a product. It will remind the designer not to overlook important human factors criteria. EXAMPLE: DESIGN OF PICKUP TRUCK CAB. To make things easy9 consider the design of the cab of a medium-sized truck, for instance, a one-ton pickup truck, as an example of the product to be designed, and try out the human factors check- list on this particular application. Assume a cab with three people seated abreast: a driver and two passengers. CRITERIA RELATIVE TO MAN The designer has received his assignment to design a one-ton pickup truck for use in the United States. The systems approach implies that he consider the needs of the driver and the pas- sengers in his overall design. AVERAGE MAN CONCEPT. The first thought that comes to mind is the "average man" concept. All the designer should have to do is to design his truck cab around the average American driver and his problem will be solved, right? Wrong. Chapanis (1959:104) gives a very clear explana- tion of what the term "average" means: "Averages are numbers which can be used to stand for, or represent, a group of data. They generally fall near the middle of a distribution and so may be said to indicate the central tendency of the data. " The distribution referred to here is the normal, bell-shaped symmetrical Gaussian curve, which is used because "many sets of measurements of human characteristics approximate this distribution," (Jt. Svcs Guide, 1972:35), especially anthropometric measurements, the measurements of the human body and its parts. Chapanis continues (1959:104) by defining the "arithmetic mean, M, is what most people think oL when they say average. Its formula is M - g X N where the £ sign (the capital Greek sigma) means "the sum of"; X represents any measure- ment; and N is the number of measurements." In ordei to determine the average value or arith- metic mean of a group of measurements, it is necessary to add all these measurements and then divide this sum by the number of the mehe- urements in the group. In other words, to determine the "average" standing height of pickup drivers, one needs to sum the standing heights of all pickup drivers in the population and divide this sum by the total number of pickup drivers. In 1972 there were 118 million licensed drivers in the United States. For estimating purposes, assume that only 5 percent of these drive pickups. This still adds up to 6 million pickup drivers, who will be tall or short, fat or thin, broad- shouldered and narrow-hipped or narrow-shouldered and broad-hipped, male or female. Only a few of them will fit the theoretical average. Next, Chapanis (1959:106) states that, "The median is another highly useful measure of central tendency that is commonly used when the data are markedly skewed (that 1s, unsymmetri- cal). The median is that point in a distribution of measurements which divides the measurements exactly in half. Fifty per cent of the measure- ments are always above the median; fifty per cent below it." Chapanis illustrates the use of the mean and the median, as follows (1959:107): "Although the mean and the median are both . highly useful statistics, there are occasions when one is more appropriate than the other. In skewed distributions, for example, the mean tends to be more heavily influenced by extreme measure- ments than does the median. ...When the data are so skewed (unsymmetrlcal) that there is a sub- stantial difference between the mean and the median, the median is generally the fairer statistic to use ... to show where the bulk of the data lie." In this same reference Chapanis (1959:107) goes on to say, "The mean and median are identical, or very nearly so, for normally- distributed data • • • Under these circumstances either measure will represent the central tendency in the data fairly." PERCENTILE. Chapanis clearly Introduces this concept by stating (1959:112): "Percentile measures are commonly used in human engineering work to give some indication of the variability of measurements, particularly measurements of various body sizes. For example, a typical specification might state that a piece of equip- ment should be constructed so that it will ac- commodate all but the largest 1Q per cent of a certain population. To turn this statement around, it means that the equipment should accommodate the smallest 90 per cent. The number needed is the 90th percentile."</page><page sequence="4">HUMAN FACTOR APPLICATIONS TO AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN 23 1 The Joint Services Guide (1972:35) bases its discussion of percentile by describing the use of the cumulative frequency distribution: "To obtain design values, particularly those based on anthropometric dimensions, cumulative frequency distributions are commonly used. A cumulative distribution shows the number (or proportion of people whose measurements fall at or below given values. ...If the cumulative distribution is based on normally distributed measurements, half the measurements will fall at or below the mean. From a cumulative dis- tribution one can readily obtain "percentile values" - the percent of people at or below (or above) a particular measurement. In designing to accommodate man's physical dimensions, it is common practice to use the 5th and 95th percentiles of the population of users." Thus, for normally distributed data, the mean, median and the value of the 50th percentile for those data will be equivalent. The 1975 SAE Handbook includes the SAE Recommended Practice J833a. On page 1662 the SAE Handbook defines the 5th, the 50th and the 95th percentiles for body measurements of U.S. adult men and women as follows (1975 SAE HDBK: 1662) : "Small Man - The small man represents the 5th percentile (only 5% of the population is smaller than the dimensions given) . "Medium Man - The medium man represents the 50th percentile (50% of the population is larger than and 50% is smaller than the dimensions given) . "Large Man - The large man represents the 95th percentile (only 5% of the population is larger than the dimensions given)." If the designer still is not clear on the meaning of "percentile," he is not alone. The term can be a continuing source of misunderstand- ing by engineers, especially when applied to human factors data» Design for automotive applications generally covers 90 per cent of the total driver popula- tion, which is the range from 5 per cent to 95 per cent of the adult men and women in the United States who will drive these cars. Take standing height as an example. The 90 per cent in height will include the range in value of the height of the 5th percentile through the height value of the 95th percentile. It is not economical to accommodate drivers who are shorter in stature than the 5th percentile or those who are taller than the 95th percentile in height. Special seating arrangements can be made, but such designs tend to be very expensive* The key to understanding the concept of "percentile" lies in the realization that mafcy different parameters, many different measurable criteria, are involved. For example, take the "small man" whose stature of 63.6 in (1616 mm) places him in the 5th percentile for height. Just because this "small man" is short in height will not automatically mean that this same indi- vidual is small or 5th percentile in all his other body dimensions. He may have long arms and short legs. He may have a long torso, which will increase his sitting height, combined with short forearms, which will cause his "reach" distance to be longer than the 5th percentile forearm^hand dimension. Figure 1 illustrates how easily other body measurements can vary for the large man who is 95th percentile in standing height, 72.8 in (1849 mm). For simplicity only four measurements, other than height, are shown, specifically: torso (human body without arms or legs), arms, legs, and weight. Figure 1 shows how these four body dimensions can combine to give eight differ- ent body configurations, all of which fall within the 95th percentile height category! Any one individual driver is not likely to fit into a particular percentile grouping either. Refer to Figure 2, "Anthropometric measurements of one female human being," and Figure 3, "Per- centile value of individual anthropomorphic measurements." The 12 different body measure- ments shown came from the second contributor to this paper. A testing facility compared each of these 12 measurements with the facility's human factors records, where body size data had been accumulated for about 2000 men drivers and 700 women drivers. Figure 2 indicates how the second contribu- tor's measurements compared with the facility's human factors recorded information on the other 699 women on file. The percentile value for each of her 12 different measurements is shown in the right-hand column. Figure 3 is a bar graph which plots her in- dividual anthropomorphic measurements against the percentile value of each measurement. The lowest percentile value, 14» corresponds with the sub- ject's upper arm length of 12.6 in (319 mm). This means that 86 per cent of the women in the data file have upper arms whose lengths are more than 12.6 in (319 ram) long. The highest percen- tile on the bar graph, 84, correlates with the subject's hip width of 15.9 in (403 mm). What this means, other than the obvious fact that the</page><page sequence="5">232 M. H. ALEXANDER AND R. E. DeWALD second contributor needs to reduce, is that only 16 per cent of the women in the human factors records have hips wider than 15.9 in (403 mm). It also means that 83 per cent of these women have narrower hips than that! Note that only one parameter, chair seat height, at the 54th percentile on the bar graph, is even close to the 50th percentile or "average" value for the 700 women in the human factors records. Of the 12 different measurements made, 5 fall into percentiles above the 50th percen- tile, whereas 7 fall well below the "average" or 50th percentile figure. It is thus easy to see that, for a person to be representative of the "average," the person's body measurements must fall within the 50th per- centile value for each one of all the anthropo- morphic measurements being made. In other words, the average or 50th percentile individual is a very rare bird. For all practical purposes, he does not exist. Therefore, to design vehicles for the middle 90 per cent, i.e., between the 5th and the 95th percentile, of the expected driver (both men and women) population, rather than the "average", is a reasonable solution. ANTHROPOMORPHIC DATA. Designers have several sources of human anthropomorphic data available to them. Those in government have access to the new Military Standardization Handbook, MIL-HDBK- 759, dated 12 March 1975 and titled, "Human Fac- tors Engineering Design for Army Materiel." This document was prepared just last year by the U.S. Army Human Engineering Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Chapter 9, "Dimen- sional Workspace," includes material on anthro- pometry, clothing and personal equipment. The chapter also points out limitations of these data and explains how to adjust the tabular dimensions to allow for body sizes of operators who are wearing different types of seasonal clothing. The military standard which is specified in the development of any system or subsystem for the Federal government is MIL-STD 1472, dated 1972, and entitled, "Human Engineering Design Criteria for Military Systems, Equipment, and Facilities." The information contained in these two standards is indispensable for vehicle de- signers whose product may be offered for usé or purchase by Federal government agencies. Two very good additional sources are avail- able. One is the latest (1972) edition of the "Human Engineering Guide to Equipment Design" sponsored by the Joint Army-Navy-Air Force Steering Committee, and for sale by the Superin- tendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, price, $10.2$. The catalog number is D4.10:En3 and the Stocķ No. is 008-051-00050-0. Remember that payment to the Government Printing Office is required with the order and that the check or money order must be made out to "Superintendent of Documents/1 Chapter 11, "Engineering Anthropometry," covers anthropometric data, such as factors affecting body size, structural and functional body dimen- sions, range of movement of body members, muscle strength and power. The Society of Automotive Engineers pub- lished an extremely valuable annual handbook, available to members for $20.00. The 1975 SAE Handbook (latest- edition available at the time of writing this paper) contains information on anthropometric measuring devices, operator pro- tection, safety, seating, sound, noise, vibration, and vision, to name a few of the many items of interest to the automotive designer. Human body dimensions for United States adult men and women can be found in the SAE Recommended Practice J833a, "USA Male and Female Physical Dimensions for Construction and Industrial Equipment Design," (1975 SAE HDBK: 1662-1664) . There are 41 different measurements listed, all of which are defined, graphically illustrated, and re- ported in tabular form for the 5th (small) , 50th (medium), and 95th (large) percentiles. Two points of caution are in order. The percentiles given for the 41 different body parts apply only to those parts individually, not to a composite percentile human being constructed by combining all 41 percentile dimensions! This was the lesson learned from Figures 1, 2, and 3. When using SAE J833a, note that the metric equiva- lents of the inch- dimensions given in the tables of anthropomorphic measures are all in centi- meters. The vehicle designer is advised to convert all these centimeter dimensions to millimeters (multiply by 10) because both European and American vehicle designers now generally lay out their vehicle and component designs in millimeters, rather than in centi- meters, even though the overall vehicle length will amount to thousands of millimeters. This conversion to millimeters i s/ recommended to avoid the unpleasant possibility of having all the di- mensions off by a factor of 10 ! The boss may not look kindly on this type of human error showing up in a vehicle design. SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS The design of the truck cab interior will be influenced by the tasks the driver will per- form. The following task characteristics have</page><page sequence="6">HUMAN FACTOR APPLICATIONS TO AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN 233 already been determined by the systems analysis phase» and these characteristics must be Incor- porated Into the design: (1) The nature» frequency and difficulty of tasks. (2) The body positions required for doing these tasks. (3) The mobility and flexibility that these tasks require of the operator. (A) Necessary increases to critical design dimensions: (a) Allowances to compensate for obstacles and projections. (b) Allowances for protective clothing and allowances needed for pieces of equipment that must be carried inside the cab. (5) Interference among several tasks which the operator must do at the same time. (6) Individual differences in human strength, handling capabilities, and range of motion. Once the many tasks have been considered, the spatial relationships can be planned to enable the driver to perform his job. A layout of the cab interior will be needed to show the relationships between the various space require- ments. It is recommended that the designer review SAE J15A, "Operator Enclosures (Cabs) - Human Factor Design Considerations" (1975 SAE HDBK: 1671) and use it as a guide in determining the amount of space the operator will need to do his job. This "work envelope," or the minimum normal spatial volume within which the man oper- ates, is illustrated for both the seated and standing 95th percentile U.S. male operator. The designer must realize that any reduction in this necessary operating space will degrade the man's performance. CONTROL CONSIDERATIONS. Picture the truck cafr interior and visualize the driver performing his task. Turn to SAE J898a (1975 SAE HDBIC: 1169-1670) for "Control Locations for Construc- tion and Industrial Equipment Design," which indicates placement of hand- and foot-operated controls for the 5th through the 95th percentile seated operator of construction equipment. The work envelope shows a range of motion for the operator's arms and legs which may be greater than needed for a pickup truck driver, but its oversized space requirement will help the desig- ner to think of the truck driver as a dynamic, moving vehicle operator, rather than a sedentary, static occupier of the driver's seat. The driver must be able to reach his con- trols: The steering wheel, foot controls, hand shift levers, and operate them easily. The loca- tion of these controls should be in a familiftr place, so that the driver does not have to hiunt for a needed control and possibly take his ejyes off the road - an accident-conducive condition. The gages and dials displayed on the instrument panel should be grouped so that the driver can see them, without visual obstruction by the steering wheel, shift levers, and the other two passengers when all three people are seated side by side. Can all controls be operated by the driver while he is wearing heavy outer clothing, or will some of the necessary controls be too small or too close together? Will his heavy out- door boots take up so much room that the driver's foot could overlap two foot controls and activate both the accelerator and the brake at the same time? Must the three people sit so close to- gether that the driver cannot reach his gearshift lever or the controls because the third person's legs are in the way? There are other considerations, of course, but these few will foster thinking of the opera- tor first when designing equipment. SEATING PROBLEMS WITHIN THE CAB. If the driver must be able to reach and operate his controls, the location of the vehicle seat must be adjustable. What happens when a 5th percen- tile driver is teamed with two 95th percentile passengers? With the seat raised and moved forward so that the small driver can reach the pedals and controls, will his two larger teammates be squeezed into the dashboard? Conversely, what about a small crew member perched between two large men, with the seat raised so high off the truck floor that the small man's legs are dangling freely and cannot give his body bracing support during a ride over rough terrain? Physiological effects of driving for long distances should also be considered. Exercise physiologists say that man is a creature of movement, that he cannot sit still for long, without degradation of physical and mental performance. Hirsch (1975:20) gives sound ad- vice for long distance driving. "Getting up and walking around stimulates circulation in the legs and thighs, carrying off muscle waste prod- ucts that build up during long hours of sitting at the wheel»" He also points out that blood circulation depends to some extent on the motion of the muscles to help heart action. When the thigh and leg muscles do not move, blood circu- lation in the lower part of the legs (calves and feetj is reduced. This results in body stiff- ness and decreased mental alertness. The best</page><page sequence="7">234 M. H. ALEXANDER AND R. E. DeWALD and quickest solution is movement. If the men can stop their truck, get out, stretch and walk around, fine. If their work assignment is such that they cannot stop, however, then the seat must be wide enough so that each passenger can shift his body position enough to relieve his own tension and fatigue, without interfering with seating space occupied by the two other people. The SAE J879b (1975 SAE HDBK: 1311-1314) "Motor Vehicle Seating Systems" establishes min- imum performance requirements for motor vehicle seats and seat adjusters. Recommended dimensions and ranges of adjustment for the design of the operator's seat for construction and industrial equipment may be found in SAE J899 (1975 SAE HDBK:1669). More comprehensive information may be found in the separate SAE publication No. HS J782a, "Seating Manual - Motor Vehicles," which is not included in the SAE Handbook. Several Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (MVSS) that apply directly to seating within the truck are listed as follows: MVSS No. Title 207 Seating Systems - passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses. 208 Occupant Crash Protection in pas- senger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses. 209 Seat Belt Assemblies - passenger cars, multipurpose passenger veh- icles, trucks, and buses. 210 Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages - passenger cars, multipurpose passen- ger vehicles, trucks, and buses. 213 Child Seating Systems. The last standard indicated, MVSS No. 213, "Child Seating Systems," is included to remind the de- signer that a pickup truck is frequently bought by a family as a recreational vehicle. Since the recreational vehicle market is continually expanding, plans for the cab interior should be considered in the light that children as well as adults may make up the "crew." CONTROL CONSTRAINTS. Not only is the design constrained by the limits imposed by the spatial requirements of human beings, but the designer's work is further constrained by various legal re- quirements. For example, the Federal Motor Vehi cle Safety Standard No. 101 (MVSS 101) entitled, "Control Locations, identification and Illumina- tion," governs the placement of hand and foot controls, the identification and labeling of these controls, and their illumination. These Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (MV1SS) are issued by the following organization: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 400 Seventh Street SW Washington, D.C. 20590 The standards are issued first in preliminary form, then in final form on a certain date, with compliance to take effect in hardware no later than a specified date. The number of the stand- ard remains constant; revisions are indicated by alphabetical suffix and changes in date. The vehicle designer is strongly advised to become thoroughly familiar with these standards and, better still, keep up to date in the many changes that are continually being made to these standards, because they directly affect his designs. The SAE Monthly publication, "Automo- tive Engineering," prints a column, "Legislative Log," that reports new standards and changes to present standards shortly after they are Issued. The "Federal Register", a government daily pub- lication available by subscription from the Government Printing Office, reports these changes within a day of issue, but there is such a high amount of printed material in every daily issue that the MVSS information tends to become submerged in a flood of other news items. Best bet is to read the SAE Legislative Log every month. Standards applying directly to controls used by the pickup truck driver include the following: MVSS No. Title 101 Control Location, Identification and Illumination - passenger cars. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence, Starter Interlock, and Trans- mission Breaking Effect - pass- enger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses. 105 Hydraulic Service Brake, Emergency Brake, and Parking Brake Systems - passenger cars. 105-75 Hydraulic Brake Systems. 124 Accelerator Control Systems Since these motor vehicle safety standards have the effect of law and must be complied with by a given date, the designer must review them first for general safety guidelines and then implement their requirements by using aids, such as the SAE standards, recommended practices and information reports, to produce the required detailed design*</page><page sequence="8">HUMAN FACTOR APPLICATIONS TO AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN 235 ENVIRONMENT The designer also considers several factors that affect the environment in which the human operator will be working. Webster (1957:486) defines "environment" is "something that surrounds, also, all the conditions, circum- stances, and influences surrounding, and affect- ing the development of an organism or group of organisms." This definition is a far cry from the popular notion that the environment is just the air men breathe! Environment also includes the atmosphere, the climate, whether hot or cold conditions, high humidity, the amount of ventila- tion to prevent build-up of noxious gases in the cab. It also relates to the levels of visibility during daylight and darkness, vibration of the vehicle, sound and noise levels within the vehicle - the list continues to grow. The designer's attention has been directed to spatial problems within the mini-environment of the truck cab. Additional environmental factors will be mentioned, because they can be so easily overlooked, to the detriment of the systems performance. Environmental conditions can have profound effects on human performance. It may be meaningful to classify environmental factors in terms of wnat the designer can do about them. First, there are some environmental factors that are under the designer's direct control. The designer can control illumination, ventilation rates, interior heating, and so forth. Other en- vironmental factors are not under the designer's control - for example, rain, snow, mud, solar radiation, and the like. Still other environ- mental factors arise from the design itself - noxious substances, noise, heat radiation from components, and others. Throughout design, the environment in which the equipment will be operated must be considered. Chapter 11 of the Military Stan- dardization Handbook, "Human Factors Engineering Design for Army Material," (MIL HDBK-759, 1975: 207-236) gives very good coverage on environmen- tal problems. The third edition of "Human Factors Engineering" (McCormick, 1970:451-572) includes four chapters on "environment" which discusses illumination, atmospheric conditions, noise, and how man is affected by motion. HOT AND COLD ENVIRONMENTS. The design approach used in satisfying requirements for hot and cold environments depends on how the equipment will be used. Each climatic zone has its own individual conditions. Michigan has a temperate climate moderated to some extent by the effect of the Great Lakes. To the southwest about 1500 miles drivers exper- ience the hot, dry summer climate of the seml- arid regions of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. The one-ton pickup truck must operate under these hot, dry conditions, as well as the more temperate ones. The first reaction will probably be, "Put in air condi- tioning!" True, cooling the air in the truck cab would make a much pleasant er atmosphere for the passengers, but what about the additional costs? During the earlier systems analysis phase a trade-off analysis was made which considered the advantages and disadvantages of air condi- tioning for the pickup truck. The advantage of having a cool interior was balanced against how well or how poorly the driver would perform his task under high heat stress, as well as the added cost of increased horsepower, vehicle weight, added maintenance, and space requirements of the cooling equipment. All this extra hardware costs money which is reflected in the asking price to the customer. If the price is thought to be more than the customer will pay, alternate approaches to air conditioning may be tried, such as the use of light colors, ventilation, and shaded glass areas to reduce the interior temperature. These are aids which are less expensive ways to counteract the effects of heat. The Human Factors Engineering Design for Army Material (MIL HDBK-759, 1975:212) points out basic factors which determine the degree of heat stress exerted by the environment: !tair temperature, humidity, air movement, and heat radiation (and/or direct conduction from objects)." The extent to which these factors degrade the driver's performance must be considered with regard to the additional hard- ware costs resulting from the use of air condi- tioning equipment. HIGH HUMIDITY. MVSS No. 104 covers "Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems" and No. 104 pertains to "Windshield Defrosting and Defogging Systems." Both these standards apply to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks and buses. VENTILATION. Theré should be sufficient ventilation to provide clean air for breathing and to control air contamination. Makeup air must be brought in from the outside of the cab. The danger here is that the outside air may be- come contaminated by engine exhaust gases which, in low concentrations, can seriously affect the crew by causing eye irritation, nausea, reduced</page><page sequence="9">236 M. H. ALEXANDER AND R. E. DeWALD mental alertness and possibly unconsciousness. (MIL STD HDBK: 228) "Carbon monoxide Is particularly dangerous. Odorless, colorless, and tasteless, it cannot ordinarily be detected by the human senses. Its effects are cumula- tive, so concentration which personnel can tolerate for short times may become dangerous", during longer exposure. The designer should take particular note of the locations of the air intakes for the truck's personnel heater and air conditioning systems to avoid contamin- ation of incoming air by engine exhaust gases. NOISE. Excessive noise has four possible effects on personnel: damage to hearing, in- terference with conversation, reduced driving efficiency, and nervous fatigue and exhaustion. It is apparent that the designer needs to be able to estimate the noise level within the cab. The contents of two SAE Recommended Prac- tices are of interest to the designer: J336a, "Sound Level for Truck Cab Interior," (1975 SAE HDBK: 1393) and J919a, "Sound Level Measurements at the Operator Station for Agricultural and Construction Equipment," (1975 SAE HDBK: 1401- 1402). J336a shows how to conduct a sound test to determine the highest value of interior level, while thè truck windows and vents are in the fully closed position and all accessories are turned off. J919a describes a similar type of sound level test applied to farm and construction ma- chinery. If the vehicle has air conditioning, the sound level test is conducted with all win- dows, doors, and vents closed and all acces- sories turned off, except the radio. If the vehicle does not have air conditioning, a second noise- level test is required, with doors, vents, and windows open and all accessories turned off. The procedures and results of these tests will give the designer a good estimate of the noise level that can be expected in his pro- posed cab. Since the noise sources in the cab (pri- marily engine and tires) are external to the cab, they cannot be eliminated completely - such a course is impractical. The cab de- signer will have to rely on techniques of ab- sorbing some sounds and masking others. This can be done by using cab interior panels made of sound-absorptive materials. A word of caution about ear protection devices. Ear safety plugs must be individually fitted to the wearer. If the plugs are too large» the wearer experiences painr from inter- nal pressure within the ear. If the plugs are too small, they cannot provide effective pro- tection. Wearing ear plugs generates two problems for the wearer: (1) Possibility of ear infection from dirty plugs. Using throw-away plugs which are used only once and then discarded can help prevent this possibility. (2) Ear plugs not easily observable by others. If the passengers do not realize that the driver is wearing ear plugs, they may not be able to warn him against sudden danger. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has published a 64-page study, "The Re- lations of Hearing Loss to Noise Exposure." This report tells what factors enter into the industrial loss of hearing; how much certain types of noise affect hearing; what allowance to make for recovery of hearing after noise exposure; what loss of hearing to expect of different age groups. The ANSI report No. is Z24-X-2 and is available for $6.00 from: American National Standards Institute 1430 Broadway New York, N.Y. 10018 VIBRATION. The designer knows that vibra- tion affects the occupants of the cab, but he may not realize how far-reaching the effects of vibration on personnel can be over an extended period of time. In a two-part article in the National Safety News for Nov- ember and December, 1975, Michael P. Blake, of the Vibration Institute, Downers Grove, Illinois, gives a very good introduction to the problems resulting from vibration, (Blake, 1975:62,64). The extent of this physical de- gradation of driver performance can range from general discomfort and annoyance, aches and pains, to fatigue, nausea and visual dis- orientation. The standard covering vibration effects on the human body is the International Standards Organization (ISO) standard No. ISO 2631-1974, "Guide for the Evaluation of Human Exposure to Whole-Body Vibration," available from ANSI for $10.00. For further information the designer may consult the $6.00 ANSI report No. S3-W-39, "The Effects of Shock and Vibration on Man," which deals with the three main problems of vibration with regard to human beings:</page><page sequence="10">HUMAN FACTOR APPLICATIONS TO AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN 237 (1) Determination of the structure and properties of the human body considered as a mechanical as well as a biological system; (2) Effects of shock and vibration forces on the human body as a system; (3) Protection required by the bodily system under various exposure conditions and how to achieve required protection. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has supported whole- body vibration research and has issued two reports which are free to the public. Send a self-addressed mailing label to the following address: Office of Technical Publications National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Room 530 Post Office Building Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 The two reports available are entitled, "Relationship between Whole-Body Vibration and Morbidity Patterns . . . (1) Among Motor Coach Operators," and (2) Among Heavy Equipment Operators." Procedures involved in vibration measure- ment is described in SAE Recommended Practice J1013, "Measurement of Whole Body Vibration of the Seated Operator of Agricultural Equipment," (J975 SAE HDBK: 1510-1513). This document addresses the problem of measuring vibration which is transmitted to the vehicle operator's body through the vehicle seat. Additional in- formation may be found in the SAE publication No. HS J6a, "Ride and Vibration Data Manual." All this discussion should alert the de- signer to the fact that the vibration problem has not, as yet, been completely solved. As in the case of noise, the designer must recognize that the sources of vibration are largely out- side the vehicle cab and therefore are beyond his direct control. Vibration can be reduced and controlled by isolation of the source through use of shock mountings, fluid couplings, proper balance of rotating elements, and the use of damping materials in vehicle seats. VISION CAPABILITY. Obviously, the driver must be able to see out of his vehicle in order to see where he is going. Good vision out of the cab is a must. There are many aids available to the designer on the subject of vision. SAE Recommended Practice J182a (1975 SAE HDBK: 1348) "Motor Vehicle Fiducial Mark$," describes how to locate the three-dimensional reference system on a motor vehicle. The designer may consult six SAE reports on vision in the SAE Handbook, pages 1325-1348 in the 1975 edition, and gain a real "feel" for the very real problems involved in giving the driver good vision. Review the "Vision Glossary," SAE J264, page 1345, first to become acquainted with the terminology. Then read SAE J941c, p. 1331 for a description of the use of the "eyellipse" in determining the driver eye locations for the seated 95th per- centile male driver. The driver's field of view is described in SAE J1050, page 1335. "Vision Factors Considerations in Rear View Mirror Design," is the title of SAE J985, p. 1325, which will add needed background as to the limitations of human beings with respect to vision. SAE Special Publication SP-279, "Visual Considerations: Man, the Vehicle, and the Highway," contains an even more complete discussion of the driver's field of view and what the driver can expect to see from his vehicle. SP-279 also contains an excellent discussion of the problems of night driving, including the multiple effects of internal reflections and glare. When driving in rain, snow or unusually cold conditions, the driver's visibility can be limited by inefficient operation of wind- shield wipers, washers, and defrosters. Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (MVSS) No. 103, "Wind- shield Defrosting and Defogging Systems..." and No. 104, "Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems..." both apply to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks and buses. Illumination both outside and inside the vehicle is directed by MVSS No. 108a, "Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment - Passenger Cars, Multipurpose Passenger Vehicles, Trucks, Buses, Trailers, and Motorcycles." Rearview mirrors are gover- ned by MVSS No. Ill and headlamp concealment devices by MVSS No. 112. The level of illum- ination within the cab must be sufficient to permit reading the driving instrument dials, but must not reduce the driver's ability to see outside his vehicle. Please refer to Figure 4, which illustrates the problem the designer has in providing good vision for both the large and small driver from the same seat. Figure 4 shows what happens when a small seated driver views an overhead traffic light and the road in front of his truck. Driver vision from the cab of a pickup truck is generally considered</page><page sequence="11">238 M. H. ALEXANDER AND R. E. DeWALD excellent - one of the reasons for the in- creasing popularity of the light truck as a means of transportation. The small driver has moved his seat forward to reach the foot ped- als. He finds he can see overhead traffic lights easily, but when he looks at the pave- ment in front of his truck, his line-of-sight contacts the pavement a long distance beyond his headlamps, instead of the preferred dis- tance of 10 feet (3.28 m) . This vision prob- lem can be solved by slanting the hood down- ward towards the front of the truck. The permissible slope is limited by possible inter- ference between the underside of the hood and the air cleaner or the top of the radiator. The seated large man has a different situation. He has adjusted his seat as far back as possible so that he can reach the foot pedals. The large man can easily see the ground 10 feet (3.28 m) or less in front of his truck, but when he looks up to see the traffic light or other types of traffic signs suspended overhead, his upward line-of-sight is limited by the top of the windshield, be- cause his eye location is too high and too far back. This situation can be further compli- cated by a pickup camper on the cargo bed. If the camper projects too far forward over the cab roof, the large driver's overhead vision will be correspondingly reduced. These are just a few of the many problems that can plague a design. MAINTENANCE AND MAINTAINABILITY If a vehicle is being designed for ease of maintenance, the chances are good that basic human engineering principles have been considered in the many other aspects of the design. Crawford (Crawford and Altman, 1972:585) states, "Designing for maintaina- bility can have a substantial impact on system performance. No matter how reliable the sys- tem is, it will eventually fail, and when it does, it must be repaired. The speed and ease of repair will partially determine how effec- tive the system will be during its lifetime." In other words, the systems approach to design includes the need for maintenance as an impor- tant phase of the life cycle. The designer of the cab might think he should not be concerned with maintenance be- cause most items requiring maintenance such as the engine, transmission, tires, etc. , are all outside the cab. The driver is the control- ling element of this man-machine system. He knows it is wise to do a maintenance check be- fore his travel begins. He will check his in- struments when he starts the truck and warms up the engine. Following the good-driving practice of keeping his eyes moving will alett him to any developing troubles when his glance passes over the instrument panel gages. Even though the driver may not do the actual repair work, the driver's quick action in preventing breakdowns can result in considerable savings in repair costs. The cab needs to be analyzed from the driver's performance point of view. One of the handiest tools to help resolve human fac- tors problems is the mockup. The full-scale &gt; three dimensional mockup can be constructed very inexpensively at the earliest point in the development cycle and can be analyzed and evaluated from the beginning of early design and throughout later changes to the prototype stage. It is a very useful aid to design, human factors, and maintenance engineers to assure that the mockup fulfills the require- ments of their respective disciplines. Mockups can be made from inexpensive mater- ials, such as foam and plywood. The workman- ship can be simple - just realistic enough to determine how equipment components should be sized, shaped and arranged so that the equip- ment can be used efficiently. The earlier in the program that spatial interferences can be identified and resolved, the better. The de- signer needs the results to incorporate them into his detailed design. The earlier he can do this, the fewer design changes he will have to make later - with corresponding decrease in design cost. The "Human Engineering Guide to Equipment Design" (Jt Svcs Human Eng Guide, 1972:398) shows a sketch of a mockup of the vehicle driver's position. ,The sketch includes sever- al individual measurements which are given in minimum, optimum, and maximum dimensions so that either large or small drivers can readily control the vehicle. One short word about service manuals. The designer should take an active part in the generation of such manuals because he knows how each part looks and how it operates. To- day's drivers are very conscious of the price of fuel and replacement parts and may want to do some of their own repair work. They will appreciate owner's manuals or shop manuals that give clear, straightforward directions how to do repairs, as the repair cost is a significant part of the overall cost of ownership »</page><page sequence="12">HUMAN FACTOR APPLICATIONS TO AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN 239 SUMMARY Using the systems approach, the human factors engineer stands ready to assist the design engineer in providing the vehicle driver with an optimum workplace. A human factors checklist has been devised for the design engineer to alert him to the major areas where troubles for the human operator generally develop. This preliminary checklist has been applied to the design of a pickup truck cab to illustrate its use. The terms "average" and "percentile" are explained. Sources of human factors data are suggested where the design engineer may find specific information as to spatial requirements for U.S. adult men and women, automotive driver controls, driver seating, environmental considerations within the vehicle, including conditions of heat, cold, and high humidity, ventilation, noise, vibration, and vision capability. When a particular component or control is the subject of a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, the pertinent standard is identified by number and title. Maintenance and maintainability considerations are empha- sized, since all products must be repaired eventually. The combination of. good human factors en- gineering and vehicles that are easy to repair can greatly improve public acceptance of the automotive design engineer's product.

APPENDIX A HUMAN FACTORS CHECKLIST In this checklist, or guideline for the design engineer, remember that the safety of the human operator is of prime importance. The various standards and regulations relative to the safety of human being have been formulated as a means to this end. With safety of the oper- ator in mind, then, the design engineer tries to integrate the operator into the overall system by improving the man-machine interface while achieving effective control, operation and main- tenance of the product he is designing. All the while he must continue to economize on manpower, skills, training requirements, and above all, costs. Here are a few quick questions to aid the design engineer in his job of designing machines to be used and operated by people. SYSTEMS APPROACH What is the job to be done? What part of the job can be done by machine? What part of the job can be done better by man? Who is going to use or operate the machine? How many people will use or operate the machine at the same time? What part of the population is going to use or operate this machine? What part of the user population must be excluded from the design? SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS How much space does the operator need to operate the machine? What parts of the human body are required to operate the man-machine system? Must the operator use his eyes? his ears? Must he turn his head? Must he bend his neck? Does the operator use his arms? One arm at a time? Both arms? Must he bend his elbows? Use his wrists, hands, or fingers? Does the operator sit or stand at his job? Must he be able to move his legs? Flex his knees? Operate controls with his feet?</page><page sequence="14">HUMAN FACTOR APPLICATIONS TO AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN 24 1 CONTROLS Can the operator reach all controls? Can the controls be operated in proper sequence? Can hand and foot controls be operated independently of each other? Are controls for regulating seat height readily accessible? Can the operator's seat be adjusted up and down as well as forward and back? Can the operator reach. his controls when the seat is adjusted to his individual opera- ting position? INSTRUMENTS AND GAGES When the operator is seated or standing in his normal working position, Can he see all his instruments? Must he change his head position to see any of the instruments? Are any of the instruments partially hidden by projecting controls or other pieces of equip- ment? Are all instruments labelled? Can he read the instrument labels without bending forward for a closer look? WARNING LIGHTS Are warning lights within 30 degrees of the operator's forward line-of-sight? When the warning light turns "on", can it be seen readily against the rest of the panel background? If the warning light is a flasher, does it flash at no more than 10 times per second so that it can be detected readily? Are red and yellow lights placed far enough apart so that their colors cannot be confused when both lights are "on"? Are all warning lights labelled? Can the instruments and the warning lights on the panel layout be understood easily by a . partially color blind person? ENVIRONMENT In what climate is the machine going to be used or operated? Can the designer control the environment of the operator's station? What aspects of the environment must the designer consider: Temperature. Heater? Humidity. Air conditioning? Air speed. Ventilating fans? Operator's Clothing. Will the type of clothing the operator wears affect the work station environment? Can the operator's clothing interfere with his operation of the machine? VISION CAPABILITY Does the operator have adequate vision both inside and outside his work station? Are visual controls and vision aids easily accessible and readily operated from the opera- tor's seat? VENTILATION Is there sufficient clean air to breathe? Is there enough makeup air to minimize air contamination? Is the operator's work station protected from the entrance of noxious gases, such as carbon monoxide? NOISE What is the expected noise level of the operator's station? Is the noise level below the acceptable limits? Can the noise level at the work station be reduced by acoustic enclosure? Must individual hearing protection be provided for the operator? VIBRATION What aspects of vibration must the desig- ner consider? Frequency. Amplitude of displacement. Direction of displacement. Duration. Are the vibration measures experienced by the operator in this man-machine system below acceptable human tolerance levels? Has the operator's work station been iso- lated from incoming vibration? Does the reduced vibrational input apply, whether the operator is seated or standing?</page><page sequence="15">242 M. H. ALEXANDER AND R. E. DeWALD MAINTENANCE AND MAINTAINABILITY Has the design been looked at from the maintenance point of view? Does the repairman have room to work? Are the items requiring more frequent repair readily accessible? Must other parts of the machine be removed in order to reach the item to be repaired? Are special tools required to perform certain important repairs? Can the instructions in the repair manuals be readily understood? SAFETY Does the design comply with all legal con- straints issued by government agencies, such as the Motor Vehicle Safety Standards from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration?</page><page sequence="16">HUMAN FACTOR APPLICATIONS TO AUTOMOTIVE DESIGN 243 o EpS2 Eziļf X _ lxi X 5 zzz - h &lt; 00 H Oí*" řs co O LU -J Uj û CO ^ Z 5£o&lt; uihO« hlilKÏ d t/î 00 | hlilKÏ Zûm' UJ 3 I o o 3 _i i- o S ¡SM°S fe?z° o&gt; E o i 'C* I- I- Ss&lt;s O 00 O 00 z Z X - UJ &lt;žS-* z - « O CD 00 - « O !ZZ 1 CD 2¿ 00 o 1 CO ej _J o CO S"&lt;| ej _J o zxû ™" CO X ™" CO X &lt; S2 &gt; h S ui o Z uiXZ^ Ua~2 Ua~2 K|ugj jāņs 5. z ®&gt; D ZhOÏ hIAlS o ik</page><page sequence="17">244 M.
