<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Short History of Religions. By E. E. Kellett. (Gollancz; 7s. 6d.) Religion. By Nathaniel Mickiem. (Home University Library, Oxford; 5s.) La Religion Romaine. Par Maurice David. (Editions Catholicit√©, Lille.), It cannot be said that Mr Kellett 's account of the history of religions is satisfactory. In spite of the many interesting inter- pretations he advances and the number of facts he has assembled his treatment of the subject is superficial. The first chapter on 'Religion: its nature and origin' emphasises too strongly the divorce between religion and morality, and while none would deny the tension found in historical religion between priest and prophet, institutionalism and personal approach it is well not to press the distinction too far lest it become an empty frame into which the</page><page sequence="2">332 LIFE OF THE SPIRIT facts will not fit. The best portions of the book are those which attack anthropomorphic religious attitudes- though even this atti- tude is not as simple as Mr Kellett suggests - and those which reveal the author's own sympathy for the 'weak and oppressed'. No one can be an authority on the whole field of religious history, but it is difficult to account for such statements as that for St Paul 'the historical Jesus was evidently secondary' or the description of the Hebrew prophets in terms of what is most trivial in their teaching. Dr Mickiem, on the other hand, has produced a most stimulating interpretation of the whole field of religion. The depth of Dr Mickiem' s knowledge is measured by the caution with which he handles his subject matter, and while the book advances no new or startling theory, it is distinguished for the ease and lucidity with which the various religious viewpoints are expressed. Dr Mickiem deals with his subject under various characterisations based on fundamental religious attitudes: - the Impersonal Sacred, the Religion of Nature and so on. At first sight some of the bed-fellows we find brought together seem rather incongruous, for instance Buddha and Epicurus. The divisions and groupings, it is soon dis- covered, fit into the framework of the whole book; they are con- cerned with typical aspects rather than with religious movements in their totality, so that one religio-cultural current, historically characterised by a particular lab-el, may well be found in several of Dr Micklem's groupings. The book must be read as a whole if its full value is to be appreciated, but the chapter on Mysticism may be singled out as particularly illuminating. M. David's work covers the special subject of Roman religion in a competent manner. Intelligently and methodically M. David defines and arranges the various elements in Roman religion and the final result is an excellent little reference book. M. David brings out well the fact that Roman religion was not just a series of platitudes grafted on to a rather formal nature worship, but he does not really face the problems raised by the failure of Roman religion after the Punic wars. The eclecticism of later years can only be explained by a failure of the old views to satisfy. The Roman intelligentsia tended towards scepticism or a new interpretation in terms of Eastern ideas, and state action was unable to stem the tide. Why? M. David presents the facts but omits the inter- pretation. Ian Hislop, O.P.</page></plain_text>
