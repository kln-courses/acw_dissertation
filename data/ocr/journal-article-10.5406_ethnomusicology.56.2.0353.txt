José S. Buenconsejo. DVD. 75 minutes.  2008. Available from the film maker, jose.buenconsejo@yahoo.com.  This documentary, shot and produced by José Buenconsejo with monetary  assistance from the Prince Claus Foundation for Culture and Development  (The Netherlands) and the Office of the Chancellor at the University of the  Philippines, Diliman, may stand alone as an ethnographic resource. It also  complements well his 2002 monograph, Songs and Gifts at the Frontier: Person  and Exchange in the Agusan Manobo Possession Ritual, Philippines (Routledge)  and may be used to supplement the text in upper level undergraduate and  graduate seminars.  The video is a kind of academic essay on display, with images and sound  anchored to a narrative infrastructure that is spoken throughout. Indeed, the  thesis of the narrative is placed up front, followed by a background of the place  in question, the author’s positioning as a researcher within the community,  and applicable musical examples. All are set up to support his stated thesis  that “musical gestures in Manobo music demonstrate social meanings that are  grounded in social interactions and relationships with outsiders.” While some  viewers might prefer a less author-driven approach, others will appreciate the  explicative guidance through unfamiliar territory.  Buenconsejo is a trained ethnomusicologist (with a Ph.D. from the Univer- sity of Pennsylvania)—currently serving as a faculty member in the College of  Music at the University of the Philippines—and, with his Visayan heritage, has  insight into the topic at hand. Yet, as we see shortly into the video, it took some  time for him to be accepted by the Agusan Manobo, who had trouble under- standing his avid interest in their diverse musical practices. He narrates that the  Manobo view Visayans as traders who “buy and sell things,” and that outside  practices and objects carried by these traders and brought back by Manobo  workers have been integrated into everyday life and even uniquely local special  events (such as the use of cigarettes and bottled beer in rituals). The journey  © 2012 by the Society for Ethnomusicology </page> <page sequence="2"> 354  Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 2012 between the two peoples is commonplace but arduous, for the easiest way in  and out is a long river journey.  Thus, contrasted and then conjoined here are the Agusan Manobo and the  neighboring Visayans who live in the Agusan Valley, Caraga, on the island of  Mindanao. Buenconsejo describes the former population as “inland” and “ab- original,” and the latter as “coastal” and “settlers,” setting up his thesis of encoun- ter and exchange. Whether he is dealing with the Agusan Manobo adaptations of  contemporary and folk music—clearly reflective of popular Visayan songs and  involving instruments like the guitar or the technology of sound systems—or  local rituals that incorporate material objects and the idea of a Visayan spirit,  Buenconsejo details how the processes of accommodation are evident in indi- genization and in the survival and continuing relevance of tradition.  The Agusan Manobo are one of the eight subgroups of the Manobo of Min- danao, an area in the southern Philippines that is not wholly populated by—but  often closely associated with—the Muslim peoples of the Philippines. All Manobo  dialects are related to one another, and the practice of indigenous religion among  all the Manobo involves a belief in anthropomorphic spirits that interact in posi- tive and negative ways with humans. The Manobo were once a primarily agri- cultural people, but the area is now dependent on logging, and the people often  travel outside in search of employment. Meanwhile, Visayans refers to a larger  group of Filipinos held together by language and dialects and associated with  the centrally located Visayan region of the country. In the context of the Agusan  Valley, the Visayans are considered to be settlers who, over time and sometimes  with government incentives, have made a life in Mindanao. Primarily Catholic,  as is the majority of the country, the Visayans here differ from their neighbors  and represent both the advantages and dangers of extrinsic interaction.  The documentation of Agusan Manobo music making contains common  everyday scenes, such as a man rocking a child in a hammock while he sings, as  well as extraordinary ones, including a possession ritual led by a female medium.  In this ritual sequence, one of the most compelling sections of the video, the  viewer may experience the fascination of the exotic and unknown, but the film- maker (intentionally or not) keeps the presence of outsiders in the ethnographic  present at the visual forefront, using footage rife with the flashing of off-screen  cameras. While one is not given the impression that the ritual was staged, the  very obviousness of media intrusion and the possibility of influence by visitors  in a sacred setting is clearly supportive of the author’s own thesis, as ironic as it  may seem at first glance.  There are a couple of peculiarities in the DVD that can be easily overlooked,  including the choice of a cockfight as the opening scene (perhaps an homage  to Clifford Geertz?) and the use of gong music and jaw’s harp at a couple of  points in the soundtrack—a practice that is not explained. These are minor  </page> <page sequence="3"> Film, Video, and Multimedia Reviews  355 quibbles, for in general the documentary is well organized, the scenes relate  closely to the narrative, and there are many interesting visual angles taken in  high-quality digital video. Scenes capturing instruments and musical sound  are, of course, of particular value to ethnomusicologists, and the DVD contains  some that would otherwise be quite difficult to obtain. Overall, the The River  of Exchange presents a strong thesis, an intellectually appealing narrative, and  thought-provoking examples, and it has clear appeal for scholars of Southeast  Asia, the Philippines, and ethnomusicology. Moreover, with some explanation,  the DVD can be a useful classroom resource for music and non-music courses  that deal with the Philippines or with cultural exchange in Southeast Asia, and  several scenes may also be extracted as clips for those interested in ritual. Christi-Anne Castro University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Treasure of the Lisu: Ah-Cheng and his Music. Produced by Waterdrop Films.  Directed by Yan Chun Su. Editing and story consultant, Les Blank. DVD.  30 minutes. 2010. Documentary Educational Resources, 101 Morse Street,  Watertown, MA 02472 (www.der.org).  This short, gentle documentary features Ah Cheng Heng, a member of the  Lisu people, and his chiben, a plucked lute with four metal strings (tuned, from  lowest to highest string, to approximately C4, F4, G4, C5). Ah Cheng is said to be  the sole living maker and performer of the chiben; the viewer finds him here  constructing the instrument from start to finish and performing on it in his  home, with scenes from other parts of his daily life interposed. The Lisu are from  the mountainous parts of Burma, Thailand, India, and—as shown here, in an  unnamed village in the Nu River Canyon, Yunnan Province—China, just south  of Tibet. This documentary claims that for the Lisu, the chiben ranks with the  crossbow and knife as one of their emblematic treasures.  This film will be highly provocative and useful in discussions of the rejec- tion or retention of cultural practices in the context of a global Christianity. The  Lisu are one of the few southeast Asian groups to be majority Christian (60%  according to the film), a result of British and Canadian missionary outreach in  the early twentieth century. The predominant collective music making among  the Lisu is found in their Christian worship, portrayed in the documentary  as consisting of either congregational hymn singing or group singing led by a  dancing and singing group accompanied by electric guitars and drums. Tradi- tional Lisu instruments such as the chiben, and cultural activities associated with  them (dancing and drinking around the fire, leading to groups ascending the  mountains) were in the past considered by missionaries and Lisu Christians to  be incompatible with Christian belief, and were largely discarded by the Lisu. </page> </plain_text>
