Recent avenues of exploration include a new emphasis on linguistic and textual analyses; novel method ologies for interpreting calendrical structure; and comparisons with other manuscript traditions, in particular those from highland cen tral Mexico. As a result of these studies, researchers have found that some codical almanacs functioned as real-time instruments to doc ument important astronomical events; others were used to schedule rituals as part of the 5 2-year calendar that guided civic and reli gious life in Mesoamerica during the Late Postclassic period (circa a.d. 1250 to 1520). Evidence of connections with central Mexico, documented in terms of interchange among codical scribes, sug gests the need for a more thorough exploration of Maya-highland Mexican interaction during this time period. 491</page><page sequence="2">almanac: records rimais, astronomical events, and prophecies.

Three codices attributed to the prehispanic Maya area came to light in European col lections in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: the Dresden, Paris, and Madrid manuscripts, named for the cities where they are currendy housed.1 Although tantalizing clues have been offered, their histories before reaching Europe remain unknown. All three are generally attributed to the Late Postclas sic period (circa 1250-1520), although this as sumption has been questioned recendy (see discussion below). A fourth codex, known as the Grolier following its exhibition by the Grolier Club in New York in 1971, was re covered from a cave believed to be in Chiapas, Mexico, in the 1960s, along with several pre Columbian artifacts, including sheets of blank fig bark paper. Until recendy, research by Carlson (1983) was accepted by many schol ars as indicating the authenticity of the codex, although new studies have questioned this as sumption. The basic structure of codical almanacs and tables has been understood since the 1880s as a result of the acumen of scholars such as Ernst F?rstemann, Eduard Seier, and Cyrus Thomas.2 Additionally, several early studies were highly successful in their efforts to disambiguate the iconography of codical instruments and to identify the deities pic tured. However, attempts to decipher the hi *For more detailed information about their current loca tions, see Cabello Carro (1986) and entries in Carrasco (2001). 2 Unlike tables, which are placed in absolute time by refer ence to dates in the Maya Long Count calendar, almanacs typically are structured on the basis of the 260-day ritual calendar (the tzolk'in), which combines 13 numbers with a series of 20 named days. The term instrument is used to encompass both almanacs and tables. eroglyphic texts met with limited success un til the introduction of the phonetic method of decipherment in the 1950s. These devel opments are considered briefly in the section that follows to provide a context for the dis cussion of current research. A BRIEF HISTORY OF CODICAL RESEARCH Pioneering studies in codical research include F?rstemann (1880, 1906), Schellhas (1904), Seler (1902-1923), and Thomas (1882,1884). [For a complete list of their publications relat ing to the Maya codices, see Vail &amp; Hern?ndez (2005).] F?rstemann's (1880) facsimile of the Dresden Codex (D.) remains the finest ever produced, and de Rosny's photographs of the Paris Codex (P.) and of the Cortesianus sec tion of the Madrid Codex (M.) (also published in the 1880s) likewise include details that are sometimes difficult to see on later facsimiles.3 Drawings of the Troano portion of the Madrid Codex published by Brasseur de Bourbourg in 1869-1870 formed the basis for early studies of the manuscript. To F?rstemann goes the credit for eluci dating the calendrical structure of codical al manacs and tables. Seler and Thomas likewise made significant advances in interpreting cod ical almanacs, as demonstrated in their discus sions of M. 75-76, which has a cognate in one of the codices of the Borgia (B.) group be lieved to derive from highland Mexico, and of the yearbearer almanacs (those celebrating the end of one year and the start of the next) in the Dresden and Madrid codices (Seler 1901, Thomas 1884). Seler made important contributions to the study of the Borgia as well as the Maya codices, including a number of perceptive observations about structural par allels among the Borgia almanacs and similar 3 The Madrid Codex was discovered in two parts, known originally as the Cortesianus and Troano manuscripts. They were recognized as belonging to the same codex by de Rosny in the 1880s. For this reason, many European scholars refer to the codex as the Tro-Cortesianus or Spanish Tro-Cortesiano. 498 Vail</page><page sequence="3">instruments in the Maya manuscripts (see, e.g., Seler 1902-1923,1:618-67; 1904). Seler also undertook some of the earli est studies of the codical deities, as did the German scholar Paul Schellhas (1904). Both researchers drew interesting parallels between Maya deities and their central Mexican coun terparts, and Schellhas is still remembered for the lettering system he developed to group representations of the same deity under a sin gle rubric before it was possible to identify them according to their hieroglyphic names. Thomas (1892) made some astute decipher ments under the assumption that Maya hi eroglyphs were phonetic in nature, but he later recanted his proposals in the face of sustained criticism from Seler (1902-1923, 1:558-61,562-67 [orig. 1892]). Although they did not always agree with each other, all subse quent research has built on the discoveries and methodologies of these four founding fathers. The key figure in the early part of the twentieth century was Eric Thompson, who undertook studies of the codical deities (see, e.g., Thompson 1950, 1970), developed a comprehensive catalog of inscriptional and codical glyphs (Thompson 1962), and pub lished a commentary of the Dresden Codex (Thompson 1972). Other important contri butions were made by Tbzzer &amp; Allen (1910), who catalogued the animals represented in the Maya codices along with their glyphs; G?nter Zimmermann (1956), who developed a cat alog of codical glyphs and categorized the attributive glyphs of the Maya deities; and Herbert Spinden (1924), John Teeple (1931), and Robert Willson (1924), who worked with the astronomical tables in the codices. Little progress was made in deciphering the hieroglyphic texts?with the exception of the day and month glyphs, colors and direc tions, and some of the deity names?until the 1950s, with the advent of the phonetic methodology of Yurii Knorozov (1952, 1955, 1958). Early proponents of Knorozov's work, including David Kelley (1962, 1976), James Fox, and John Justeson (Fox &amp; Justeson 1984), made initial forays, many of them highly sue cessful, into interpreting the codical texts. Kelley (1976, Ch. 4) is known especially for his insightful analysis of the codical deities. The 1970s and early 1980s marked the turning point in codical studies, highlighted by the introduction of new research method ologies that helped shape our current un derstanding of the Maya codices. The pub lication of color photographic facsimiles of the Dresden, Madrid, and Paris codices in the 1960s and 1970s by the Akademische Druck-und Verlagsanstalt in Graz, Austria, proved invaluable to furthering codical re search (Anders 1967,1968; Deckert &amp; Anders 1975), as did a compilation of the three Graz facsimiles published in the 1980s (Lee 1985). The following discussion summarizes the state of research leading up to the current decade in codical studies. It serves as a pre lude to the discussion of significant advances from 1996 to 2006. Decipherment of Hieroglyphic Texts The initial forays into phonetic decipherment cited above were followed by two seminal publications in the late 1980s (see V. Bricker 1986, Stuart 1987). Decipherment of addi tional codical glyphs rapidly followed, with contributions made by many researchers, including V. Bricker, Closs, Grube, Love, Nahm, Schele, and numerous others (Macri &amp; Looper 2003, pp. 9-11). Participants in the Maya Meetings at the University of Texas, Austin, chaired by Schele until her death in 1998, were also actively involved in deci phering and transcribing texts from the Maya codices (their studies are published in the U Mut Maya series). The culmination of earlier research has been the transcription and translation of the complete codical corpus (Davoust 1997, Schele &amp; Grube 1997, Vail 2002b, Vail &amp; Hern?ndez 2005, Vail &amp; Macri 2004).4 4Despite the promise of his early work, Knorozov's (1982) decipherments of the codical texts are not considered reliable. www.annualreviews.org The Maya Codices 499</page><page sequence="4">T: refers to a number in Thompson's glyph catalog Although most of the hieroglyphic texts can be read, their underlying metaphorical mean ing is more difficult to determine. Researchers hope to make progress on this front by apply ing techniques used by ethnohistorians and linguists working with Colonial texts such as the Popol Vuh or the Books of Chilam Balam. Significant progress has been achieved in terms of analyzing the textual and lin guistic structure of codical clauses, based on the pioneering research of V. Bricker (1985, 1986) and H?fling (1989). Addition ally, online databases of the codices (Vail &amp; Hern?ndez 2005, Vail &amp; Macri 2004) offer researchers the capability to search the entire codical corpus by T number [the cataloging system developed by Thompson (1962)], pho netic transcription, English gloss, or Maya (Yucatec or Ch'olan) gloss. Studies of Deities The most significant findings since the 1970s concerning the anthropomorphic figures de picted in the codices have been (a) the discov ery that they are, indeed, deities, as demon strated by Ringle's (1988) decipherment of the T1016c glyph that is frequently paired with name glyphs in codical texts as k'uh, a Yu catec word meaning "god" as well as "holy" and "sacred",5 and (b) the realization that these figures are best understood not as in dividual entities, but rather in terms of their relationships with each other and as group ings of related deities (see, e.g., Closs 1979; Vail 1996, 2000b). The delineation of de ity complexes forms the subject of publica tions by various authors, including Bill, Closs, Ciaramella, Kocyba, Love, Milbrath, Paxton, Stone, Taube, and Vail. A complete list of sources is included in Vail &amp; Hernandez's (2005) annotated bibliography. Coe's (1989a) survey of representations of the Hero Twins from the Popol Vuh creation 5Maya deities are primarily personifications of natural el ements or forces, including rain, maize, wind or breath, death and destruction, etc. story in Classic and Postclassic Maya art is one of the earliest forays into identifying cre ation imagery in the codices (see discussion in Current Trends below). Taube (1992) pro vides additional examples of codical counter parts to the Hero Twins and notes connections between Maya and central Mexican deities in the tradition of Seler. His study also estab lishes links between Classic and codical vari ants of the same deity. Sotelo Santos (2002) and Vail (1996) fo cus specifically on deities from the Madrid Codex, whereas Riese (1982), Taube &amp; Bade (1991), and Whittaker (1986) document the presence of several central Mexican divinities in the Dresden Codex Venus table. Astronomical and Calendrical Studies Investigations of the astronomical tables in the Dresden Codex have been some of the most fruitful avenues of codical exploration since Thompson's (1972) commentary. Re search has focused on the Venus table (Aveni 1992a, 2001, pp. 184-93; H. Bricker &amp; V. Bricker, submitted manuscript; Closs 1977; Lounsbury 1983; Milbrath 1999, Ch. 5; Schele &amp; Grube 1997; Tedlock &amp; Tedlock 2002/2003), the eclipse table (Aveni 2001, pp. 173-84, H. Bricker &amp; V. Bricker 1983, Milbrath 1999, pp. 111-15, Schele &amp; Grube 1997), the Mars table (Aveni 2001, pp. 196 200, H. Bricker &amp; V. Bricker 1997, V Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1986b, Love 1995), the sea sonal table (V Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1988), and more recendy the water tables on pages 69-74 (V Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 2005).6 The Dresden astronomical tables are also the fo cus of studies by Justeson (1989) and Everson (1995), and they are discussed in Galindo Trejo's (2000) summary of the current state of archaeoastronomical research in Mesoamer ica. Additionally, two full-length monographs are concerned with Maya astronomy: Aveni's 6 Space considerations preclude a comprehensive list of sources.

Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico (1980, 2001) and Milbrath's (1999) Star Gods of the Maya. Although neither focuses exclusively on the codices, they both include extensive discus sions of Maya astronomical tables. A third monograph, Astronomy in the Maya Codices by Harvey and Victoria Bricker, is currently in preparation. As a result of these studies, we know that the Maya tracked the synodic cycles of Venus and Mars (i.e., the period required for a planet to return to the same position?such as its predawn rise?with respect to the sun), as well as the retrograde period of Mars; used tables to chart the seasons (solstices and equinoxes) in relation to their civic year (haab7); predicted solar and lunar eclipses; and tracked the mo tion of the planets against the background of the stars. The latter discovery is especially significant because it shows that observations were made in relation to other celestial bod ies and not just to the earth. Despite the cen tury since F?rstemann's initial research, how ever, scholars still cannot agree about how to interpret and date the Dresden astronom ical tables (compare, for example, H. Bricker &amp; V Bricker 1997, V. Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1986b, and Love 1995 regarding the Mars table). New models to emerge during the past two decades include the belief that Maya tables were designed to have an observational func tion, rather than serving only for computa tions or as a record of past events (H. Bricker &amp; V Bricker 1983, 1992; V. Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1986b), and the recognition that Maya astronomers tracked the sidereal, as well as the synodic, intervals of celestial bodies (Aveni et al. 2003, H. Bricker et al. 2001, Tedlock &amp; Tedlock 2002/2003).7 The latter discovery al lows us to develop models for understanding positional (as opposed to horizon-based) as tronomy in ancient cultures. 7 The sidereal interval is the amount of time it takes for a planet or other celestial body to return to the same point in the sky relative to the background of stars, as observed from the earth. Another object of intensive inquiry in re cent years is the "zodiac" on P. 23-24 (Aveni 2001, pp. 200-5; H. Bricker &amp; V. Bricker 1992; Johnson &amp; Quenon 1994; Justeson 1989; Kelley 1976, pp. 45-50; Love 1994, Ch. 10; Milbrath 1999, Ch. 7; Paxton 1992; Schele 1992; Severin 1981; Tedlock 1999; Tedlock &amp; Tedlock 2002/2003).8 As with the Dresden astronomical tables, scholars dis agree about how it should be interpreted and dated. Tedlock (1999), for example, uses the same framework as that of her contempo rary K'iche' informants from Momostenango, Guatemala, to interpret the sequence of Paris constellations, resulting in a model that dif fers from that proposed by other researchers (see, e.g., H. Bricker &amp; V Bricker 1992). Another instrument that has engendered controversy is the Venus almanac found in the Grolier Codex. As Carlson (1983) and others have shown (Aveni 1980, pp. 193-95; 2001, pp. 193-95), it mirrors the structure of the Dresden Venus table (although it has pages devoted to all four stations of the planet, rather than just to heliacal rise). Nevertheless, a number of scholars believe that the codex is a recent forgery and not an authentic pre hispanic document (Baudez 2002, Milbrath 2002, Thompson 1975). This question is ex amined in the discussion of Provenience and Dating below. Only recently have other instruments lack ing Long Count dates been considered as having possible astronomical content. Exam ples include the almanac on pages 12 b-18b of the Madrid Codex (H. Bricker et al. 1997; Milbrath 1981, 1999, pp. 259-62; Wulfing 1994); almanacs from the Dresden Codex that may refer to eclipse cycles (H?fling &amp; O'Neil 1992), Venus (H?fling 1988), or the moon's sidereal location (Tedlock &amp; Tedlock 2002/2003); and possible references to Venus on the Madrid yearbearer pages (Closs 1992). 8Love (1994, Ch. 10) objects to labeling this almanac a "zodiac" because some of the constellations depicted fall outside the path approximately 18 degrees wide that repre sents the zodiac, i.e., the course traveled by the sun, moon, and planets as seen by observers on earth. www.annualreviews.org The Maya Codices 501</page><page sequence="6">tzolk'in: Maya 260-day rimai calendar, consisting of 20 named days, each paired with a number ranging from 1 to 13 (i.e., 1 Imix, 2 Ik', 3 Ak'b'al, etc.) Calendar Round: cycle of 52 years formed by pairing the tzolkHn and baaby cross-dating: used to anchor undated astronomical and seasonal events in absolute time by linking them to dated occurrences of the same events in astronomical tables Another almanac from the Madrid Codex, on pages 75-76, has long been interpreted as a cosmogram mapping the four-quadrant plus-center structure of the Maya universe onto time and space. New models for inter preting its calendrical structure suggest that it incorporates a haab* as well as a tzolkHn cycle (Paxton 2001) and that it may visu ally represent the 52 years of the Maya Cal endar Round (Vail 2004, Vail &amp; Hern?ndez 2006). Other studies have focused on the cal endrical structure of Maya almanacs and new methodologies for interpreting relation ships among almanacs both within a par ticular codex and across codices. Some of the more innovative include Aveni's (Aveni et al. 1996) examination of interval structures shared among almanacs in the Dresden and Madrid codices; V. Bricker's (1998) analysis of agricultural almanacs and their placement within a 52-year cycle; and studies by the Brickers and their colleagues using a method ology of "cross-dating" almanacs with as tronomical tables (see discussion in Current Trends below). Additionally, Grana-Behrens (2002) recendy documented haaV dates (ref erences to 7 and 12 Pop) on the Madrid year bearer pages, and Jiingel (1999) commented on what have been interpreted as scribal er rors in a Madrid almanac and how they should be interpreted. Commentaries and Iconographie Studies Substantial research has been devoted to un derstanding the content of the Maya codices over the past 20 years. Publications of note include two new facsimiles: one of the Dres den Codex (C?dice de Dresde 1998), pub lished by Cholsamaj in Guatemala using F?rstemann's 1887 photographs, and an edi tion of the Madrid Codex (C?dice Tro Cortesiano 1991) that reproduces the com position and layering of the original in the Museo de Am?rica. Additionally, commen taries of the Dresden (Davoust 1997, Schele &amp; Grube 1997), Madrid (V Bricker &amp; Vail 1997, Vail 2002b), and Paris (Love 1994, Treiber 1987) codices greatly extend our understand ing of these manuscripts, with considerable emphasis focused on the context behind the activities and events depicted in the almanacs. Other book-length monographs treat the fol lowing subjects: the Madrid Codex from a de scriptive perspective (Escalante 1992, Rivera Dorado 1991) and trees in the Dresden Codex (Salgado Ruelas 2001). Entries in the Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamericun Cultures (Carrasco 2001) provide a summary of re search pertaining to the four codices as of 2001. A number of thematic studies, especially of the Madrid almanacs, have been undertaken, focusing on topics including yearbearer ritu als (Bill et al. 2000, Love 1991, Taube 1988, Vail 1997b), weaving (Ciaramella 1999), hunt ing and trapping (Colas 1999, Vail 1997a, von Nagy 1997), and apiculture (Ciaramella 2002, Vail 1994).9 What distinguishes these studies from those of earlier scholars is the emphasis on placing them within a contextual frame work through a careful sifting of the ethnohis toric and ethnographic literature pertaining to similar activities or rituals, or through a cal endrical analysis of interrelationships among almanacs, as described below. New areas of investigation include an ex amination of material culture depicted in the Maya codices; studies of the scribal tradi tion; and references to creation cosmology. Analyses of the types of artifacts depicted in the codices have been extremely helpful in dating these manuscripts (see, e.g., Graff 1997,2000; Paxton 1986,1991; and discussion in Provenience and Dating below). Research by Lacadena (1995, 2000) and his colleagues (Ciudad Ruiz 2000, Ciudad Ruiz &amp; Lacadena 1999, Sanz Castro 2000), although focused on the Madrid Codex, has filled in some 9 See Vail &amp; Hern?ndez (2005) for a list of additional studies. $02 Vail</page><page sequence="7">important but long neglected gaps in our knowledge of the people responsible for draft ing the Maya codices. Pal?ographie studies suggest that nine scribes were involved in painting the Madrid (Ciudad Ruiz 2000, La cadena 2000).10 Earlier studies of the Dresden Codex suggest that it was painted by eight sep arate hands (Zimmermann 1956, Tafel 5; but see Lacadena 1995, pp. 182-85). Ciudad Ruiz &amp; Lacadena's (1999, pp. 1000) studies indicate that the codices were composed and used by scribes who were also priests. Groundbreaking research by Freidel, Grube, Looper, MacLeod, Schele, Villela, and others (see, e.g., Freidel et al. 1993, Schele 1992), focusing on how the events of creation are played out in the night sky and in pre hispanic foundation rituals, offers researchers fertile ground for continuing investigation for years to come. Only recently have scholars begun to focus on representations of these events in the Maya codices and their calendri cal significance. Of special interest is an em phasis on 4 Ahaw dates in the Madrid Codex. Vail (G. Vail, submitted manuscript) consid ers how the activities depicted may be a repli cation of the events of the original creation that took place on the Calendar Round date 4 Ahaw 8 Kumk'u. CURRENT TRENDS IN CODICAL RESEARCH The most significant developments during the past decade include new evidence concern ing the provenience and dating of the Maya codices; new methodologies for dating Maya almanacs; linguistic analyses of codical texts; and connections among codices in the Maya and Borgia groups that provide evidence for Maya-highland Mexican interaction during the Late Postclassic period. Following a dis cussion of these topics individually, the review concludes by considering what these trends promise for future research. 10Sotelo Santos (2002, p. 46) believes that at least eight scribes were involved. Provenience and Dating One of the primary areas of investigation in recent years involves using evidence internal to the manuscripts to determine when and where they were painted. The Dresden Codex contains a number of Long Count dates that can be correlated with the Gregorian calendar. The earliest, ranging from the eighth to the tenth centuries, appear to be records of his torical events (V. Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1992, pp. 82-83; Lounsbury 1983). Dates believed to be contemporaneous with the use of the codex fall in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries (V. Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1992, p. 83). These dates contrast with those proposed by earlier studies. Thompson (1972, pp. 15 16), for example, suggested that the codex was painted between a.d. 12 00 and 1250 largely on the basis of stylistic evidence, which Paxton (1986, Ch. 6) found consistent with dates recorded in the astronomical tables. Never theless, her study of ceramic forms depicted in the codex indicates similarities to those manufactured throughout the Late Postclas sic period in the northern lowlands, suggest ing that the Dresden Codex may have been painted after the thirteenth century (Paxton 1991, p. 307). Lacadena (1995, p. 362; Ciudad Ruiz &amp; Lacadena 1999, p. 1000) proposes a late date for the codex, whereas Grube (2001, p. 3 3 7) notes that, although it was painted dur ing the Postclassic period, it probably repre sents a copy of a Classic period manuscript. Where it was painted remains unknown, al though analyses by Paxton (1986,1991,2004) support a provenience in the Yucat?n penin sula. She suggests the following possible loca tions: Mayap?n, Chich?n Itz?, Tulum, Santa Rita Corozal, or possibly Kabah (Paxton 1991, p. 307). Earlier, Thompson (1972, p. 16) sug gested that it was composed at Chich?n Itz?, and Coe (1989b) proposed that it may have been one of the codices acquired by Cort?s and his men on Cozumel Island in 1519, which later reached Spain as part of the "royal fifth." Scholars generally agree that the Paris Codex originated at Mayap?n (Figure 1) or www.annualreviews.org The Maya Codices 503</page><page sequence="8">Figure 1 Sites occupied during the Postclassic period in the Maya lowlands. Illustration courtesy of Anthony P. Andrews. k'atmi: period consisting of 20 tuns of 360 days. One of the units of the Long Count calendar in a nearby area [Love 1994, Ch. 2; but see Thompson (1972, p. 16), who alternately proposed an eastern Caribbean provenience]. Suggestions that it originated at Mayap?n stem from similarities between k^atun cer emonies depicted in the codex (a k'atun is a period of approximately 20 years) and those recorded on stone monuments from Mayap?n. Love (1994, p. 13) dates the codex to around 1450 on the basis of studies that place Mayap?n Stela 1 in 1441. A recent re analysis, however, suggests that the stela may date to 1185 instead (Schele &amp; Mathews 1998, p. 367). Milbrath &amp; Peraza Lope (2003, p. 39) accept this earlier dating because it supports their interpretations of Mayap?n's architec tural sequence. The Paris k'atun pages, there fore, may refer to an earlier cycle than that proposed by Love. V. Bricker (1995) notes that calendrical and astronomical data provide support for a Classic period date, a.d. 731 987, as originally proposed by Treiber (1987). In this case, similar to the Dresden examples previously cited, it is necessary to separate his torical texts copied from earlier manuscripts from the painting of the physical codex itself. As Love (1994, p. 8) and Lacadena (Ciudad Ruiz &amp; Lacadena 1999, p. 1000) point out, the 504 Vail</page><page sequence="9">physical documents referred to today as the Maya codices were probably painted within 100 years or so of the conquest. Two different theories have been proposed in recent years concerning the dating and provenience of the Madrid Codex. Icono graphie evidence, including what he inter preted as a Spanish sword and a statue of a horse deity (Tz'iminchak), persuaded Porter (1997, pp. 41, 43) that the Madrid Codex was painted after Spanish contact in Tayasal, an Itz? Maya settlement in the Peten region (see Figure 1) that was visited by several expedi tions in the sixteenth and seventeenth cen turies but not "conquered" until 1697. Other recent studies (see Graff 2000, Graff &amp; Vail 2001) interpret the same imagery as consistent with a Yucatecan provenience for the Madrid Codex. Paxton (2004) notes a close similarity between the material culture depicted in the codex and that found in the northern lowlands during the Late Postclassic period. Neverthe less, as Graff (2000, p. 28) notes, the portrayal of Late Postclassic artifacts, although suggest ing that the codex was painted then, does not preclude a later date because it was not un common for artifacts from earlier periods to be depicted. Coe &amp; Kerr (1997, p. 181) also posited a postconquest date for the Madrid Codex and a Tayasal origin on the basis of a piece of Eu ropean paper with a Latin text associated with M. 56. Coe &amp; Kerr's dating of the codex to the Colonial period rests on their assumption that the European paper is embedded within the codex itself, something that later studies have shown not to be the case: The paper is clearly attached to the outer layer of the codex [H. Bricker 2004; Vail &amp; Aveni 2004, Ch. 1, note 12; see also Anders (1967, pp. 37-38), who reached a similar conclusion when he ex amined the page in question in the 1960s]. Coe &amp; Kerr suggested a Tayasal prove nience on the basis of their belief that the name "...riquez" in the Latin text referred to Fray Juan Enriquez, a Spanish friar who was killed following a visit to Tayasal in 1624. Chuchiak (2004), after making a de THEM. 56PATCH Chuchiak's (2004) analysis of the handwritten Latin text on M. 56 leaves little doubt that it is a Bula de la Santa Cruzada, a type of papal bull sold by the hundreds in colonial New Spain. The style of handwriting indicates that it was written between 1570 and 1610, when the Yucat?n peninsula experienced a shortage of printed bills. Handwritten copies were prepared by a select group of notaries; of these, Chuchiak (2004, pp. 70 72) believes he can identify the person who drafted the Bula attached to the Madrid Codex: Gregorio de Aguilar, cousin to the ecclesiastical judge Pedro S?nchez de Aguilar. S?nchez de Aguilar is best known for his passionate denunciation of Maya idolatry, which was undoubtedly strengthened by his confiscation of several Maya codices from the eastern Yucat?n peninsula between 1603 and 1608. Chuchiak (2004, pp. 79 80) proposes that one of these may have been the Madrid Codex, given to King Philip HI in 1619 when S?nchez de Aguilar returned to Spain. Although its subsequent history remains undocumented, Cabello Carro (1986) discusses the years leading to its acquisition by the Museo Arqueol?gico in Madrid (it was later transferred to the Museo de Am?rica, where it is currently housed). tailed study of the same text, concludes that it represents part of a Bula de la Santa Cruzada, a type of papal bull produced by the colonial clergy and sold to the Maya of Yucat?n (see Marhenke 1997 for her interpretation of the text's content). The 25 legible words of the text support Chuchiak's interpretation. Chuchiak points out that the papal bull could not have derived from Tayasal because the Itz? settlement was located outside the area controlled by New Spain during the six teenth century. Instead, his study supports a provenience in the northern Maya low lands. Beginning in the 1590s, bulls of the Santa Cruzada were sold to inhabitants of the Yucat?n peninsula in large numbers. Although initially viewed with suspicion, they soon were revered as sacred objects. It is therefore possi ble "that a Maya scribe or noble placed his copy of a bull into the codex to 'bless' it" (Chuchiak 2004, p. 77). When this may have occurred is not known, but the bull itself can www.annualreviews.org The Maya Codices 505</page><page sequence="10">be dated, using the two different styles of handwriting it contains, to a relatively short period between 1570 and 1610 (Chuchiak 2004, p. 68) (see The M. 56 Patch). The codex itself contains no Long Count dates that would place it in absolute time. Sev eral of its almanacs have been dated, how ever, using a methodology developed by the Brickers in the 1980s. These almanacs record astronomical and seasonal events in the tenth and fifteenth centuries (H. Bricker et al. 1997; V Bricker 1997a,b; V Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1988). It has been suggested that the earliest dated events were included because they were considered historically significant (i.e., they represent later copies of almanacs originally composed in the tenth century), whereas the later events are likely contemporaneous with the painting of the physical manuscript itself. Because of its distinctive style and the cir cumstances surrounding its discovery, many scholars are reluctant to accept the Grolier Codex as an authentic prehispanic Maya codex. To settle the debate, in the 1970s Coe submitted a fragment of bark paper found in association with the codex for radiocar bon dating. It yielded a date of 1230 ? 130 years (Carlson 1983; Coe &amp; Kerr 1997, p. 175). Nevertheless, Thompson (1975) consid ered the codex a forgery, largely on stylistic grounds, a conclusion that has been echoed in recent years by Milbrath (2002) and Baudez (2002). Milbrath (2002) notes that "the nu merous irregularities in iconography seem suspicious, as does the fresh appearance of the paint in a manuscript presumably hid den in a cave for over seven hundred years" (p. 61). On the other hand, Carlson (1983) argues that, at the time it was discovered, knowl edge about Venus iconography and its rela tion to the calendrical cycle was not sophisti cated enough for someone to have produced a forgery as detailed as the Grolier Codex. Other scholars, including Boone (2001) and Coe (Coe &amp; Kerr 1997, p. 175), likewise be lieve the codex dates to the prehispanic period. Following Carlson, Boone (2001, p. 443) sees its oddities as evidence of a hybrid manuscript produced in a borderland region where both Mayan and highland Mexican conventions were known and used. This is certainly a vi able hypothesis, but one that will ultimately be resolved only when the findings of a study being performed by the Universidad Nacional Aut?noma de M?xico are published. Although third-hand accounts suggest that scissors were used to cut some of the pages (see Milbrath 2002, p. 60), it is premature to speculate about the results of the analysis until they are made public. Also relevant to a discussion of the prove nience and dating of the Maya codices are studies of the linguistic structure and lan guages represented in the codical texts. Linguistic and Textual Analysis Some of the most innovative research on the Maya codices in recent years has resulted from an examination of the morphology and syn tactic structure of their hieroglyphic texts. Although much of this research is ongoing (Vail &amp; Macri 2004), published studies focus on comparing the structure of codical texts with Mayan languages believed to be descen dants of the languages recorded hieroglyphi cally (members of the Ch'olan and Yucatecan language families) (Figure 2). Early research on the codical texts was based on the assumption that they were writ ten by Yucatec scribes in their native lan guage. This belief derived from the then untested proposition that the hieroglyphic codices were painted in the northern Maya area, where the heaviest concentrations of lowland Maya populations resided at the time of Spanish contact in the early sixteenth cen tury. Only recently have these assumptions been questioned. In a proposal initially circulated infor mally in the late 1990s, Houston et al. (2000) asserted that the majority of Maya hiero glyphic texts, whether they were composed in Yucatec- or Ch'olan-spealting regions (see Figure 2), were written in a language they $o6 Vail</page><page sequence="11">Figure 2 Linguistic groupings in the lowland Maya area at the time of the Spanish conquest. Yucatec, Lacand?n, Itz?, and Mop?n belong to the Yucatecan language family, whereas Chontal, Ch'ol, Ch'olti', and Ch'orti' are members of the Ch'olan family. Illustration courtesy of Victoria R. Bricker. termed Classic Ch'olti'an, an ancestral form of the eastern Ch'olan languages Ch'olti' and Ch'orti' (Ch'orti' is still spoken in the vicin ity of the archaeological site of Copan in Honduras). They propose that Classic Ch'olti'an represented a lingua franca that was known to and used by the elite as a means of communicating across a wide area inhab ited by speakers of several different Mayan languages. Also during the 1990s, researchers first questioned the idea that hieroglyphic texts in the Maya codices were written exclusively in Yucatec (Lacadena 1997, Wald 2004 [1994]) on the basis of the discovery of texts in the Dresden and Madrid codices that reflected Ch'olan rather than Yucatecan morpholog ical patterning, as well as both Yucatecan and Ch'olan vocabulary. Evidence internal to the codices points to the fact that they con tain almanacs that were composed at vari ous points in time (see, e.g., V. Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1992, V. Bricker &amp; Vail 1997). Almanacs would have been copied?and fre quently reworked and updated?from older documents, much as occurred with texts from the colonial Yucatec Books of Chilam Balam (V. Bricker 2000). Therefore, an almanac or text may have been composed originally by a Ch'olan speaker, but the same text appearing in the Madrid or Dresden Codex may have been recopied by a Yucatec speaker, or vice versa. In other words, the language recorded in codical texts does not necessarily reflect that of the scribes who copied and drafted the al manacs and tables composing what we know of today as the Maya codices (V. Bricker 2000, Vail 2000a). www.annualreviews.org The Maya Codices 507</page><page sequence="12">Astronomical and Calendrical Studies In the late 1980s, there was a significant shift in our understanding of the astronomical con tent of the Maya codices as a result of V. Bricker &amp; H. Bricker's (1986a, 1988, 1992) discovery that, as some Maya almanacs depict astronomical and seasonal events, they, like ta bles, can be dated in real (absolute) time. This absolute dating can be accomplished by cross dating depictions of astronomical and/or sea sonal events with those from astronomical tables that can be securely dated. However, because such events recur at various intervals, one must also have information relevant to the Maya haab1 (3 65-day year) to provide a unique date for an almanac. By way of example, the almanac on D. 38b-41b includes seasonal information (de pictions of rainfall and planting) as well as references to eclipses. With these data as a guide, the Brickers suggest that the initial date of the almanac is May 20, 775. They then interpret the iconography and hieroglyphic captions associated with the almanac's eleven frames, showing that "the almanac describes what happened during the planting season in a.d. 775, chronicling in graphic detail the drought that must have resulted in a poor har vest that year" (V. Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1992, p. 76). The Brickers' cross-dating approach has been the source of considerable debate (much of it unpublished) by codical researchers over the years. Nevertheless, scholars have made significant advances in the past decade in furthering our understanding of the astro nomical content and calendrical structure of codical almanacs (see, e.g., Aveni 2004; H. Bricker et al. 1997; V. Bricker 1997a,b, 1998; Closs 1992; Drapkin 2002; Graff 1997; Knowlton 2003; Milbrath 1999; Paxton 2001; Vail 1994, 1997a; Wulfing 1994), as well as their ritual component (see below). Many of these studies were directly influenced by the Brickers' work. Additionally, analysis of the iconography and calendrical structure of Maya almanacs (Aveni 2004; Aveni et al. 1996; Drapkin 2002; Love 1994, Ch. 5) has re vealed a number of cognate instruments in the Dresden, Madrid, and Paris codices (i.e., almanacs that have many structural and calen drical similarities but may differ in significant ways).11 These studies point to the impor tance of scribal interchange and/or the exis tence of archetypal almanacs that were copied by later generations of scribes. Studies of the ritual component of the Maya codices have also benefited from the cross-dating methodology introduced by the Brickers. Their approach relies on identi fying "like" elements in the iconography and hieroglyphic texts of almanacs and tables and interpreting these within the context of the calendrical data. Studies using this methodol ogy rely on an integrative approach?i.e., an almanac's meaning may be understood only by reference to all of its components. This method of analysis represents a sharp de parture from the approach, taken by many researchers, of divorcing the iconography and/or hieroglyphic text from its calendrical context. The Brickers' work has fostered a new emphasis in codical studies on the identifica tion of iconographie elements with apparent ritual meaning that crosscut different codical instruments (see, e.g., V Bricker 1997b; V Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1988, 1992). Re searchers have found that many of the rituals depicted in Maya almanacs can be related to haaV ceremonies described in ethnohistoric sources such as Landa's Relaci?n de las cosas de Yucat?n (Tbzzer 1941). A number of these al manacs depict rituals related to the yearbearer ceremonies, those that concern the final five days of the year (Wayeb') and the first day of the new year in the month Pop (Bill 1997; Bill et al. 2000; Graff 1997; Hern?ndez &amp; Bricker 2004; Taube 1988; Vail 2002a, 2004; Vail &amp; Bricker 2004). These activities are depicted on D. 25-28 and M. 34-37, almanacs first 11 Seier (1902-192 3,3:695-709) was the first to identify and comment on many of these cognates. $o8 Vail</page><page sequence="13">FM: Codex Fej?rv?ry-Mayer recognized as having yearbearer associations in the late nineteenth century (see previ ous discussion). The almanac on M. 51b (Figure 3, see color insert) has been iden tified as one such example (Bill 1997, pp. 114-16; Vail 1997b, p. 96,2004, pp. 243-45). Its iconography can be compared with that from the middle register of the Dresden yearbearer pages, which has been interpreted as showing offerings to the deity patron associated with the outgoing year before he is retired (Taube 1988, pp. 235-36). Rituals performed during other months of the haab\ including ceremonies associated with planting, hunting and trapping, the preparation of wooden deity images, and care of the stingless bees (Bill 1997; Ciaramella 2002, 2004; Graff 1997; Vail 1997a, 2002a, 2004; Vail &amp; Bricker 2004; von Nagy 1997), are also depicted in the Maya codices. Another recent development, sparked by the research discussed above, is the haab* model developed by Vail (2002a, 2004). She proposes that many almanacs previously be lieved to be 260-day instruments were instead used within the 52-year Calendar Round, which represents a pairing of the 260- and 365-day calendars. According to this model, almanacs with iconography that repeats from frame to frame (in which the deity shifts but the activity remains constant) are likely to be 52-year instruments. As an example, she points to M. 16a (Figure 4, see color in sert), which can be linked to a ritual dis cussed in Landa's Relaci?n that took place every haab9 (365 days) at roughly the same point in time (similar to our yearly holidays). Termed ok nah, it involved renovating the temples in honor of the Chaaks (rain gods) and gods of the field (Tozzer 1941, p. 161). M. 16a includes iconographie links to the cer emony described by Landa?a series of tem ples painted blue, the color associated with rain and fertility?as well as textual corre spondences, as suggested by the phrase ok nah beginning each clause. A traditional interpretation of the al manac's calendrical structure calls for the rep etition of the renovation ceremony every 10 to 16 days, as indicated by the black bar-and dot numbers associated with each frame (see Table la, see color insert). This makes lit tle sense given the ethnohistoric data, which suggest that the temple was renovated annu ally. However, a different reading of the same calendrical information allows the events to be interpreted as occurring at intervals of haabs rather than days. The four frames are separated by 15, 10, 11, and 16 haabs, re spectively (see Table lb). Why these partic ular intervals were chosen remains unclear; however, this is true whether they are inter preted as haabs or days. In almanacs of this type, a haaF interpretation provides a bet ter explanation of the activities pictured than do models based on reading the intervals as days. Vail's model calls for the reinterpretation of dozens of almanacs in the Maya codices. This reinterpretation, coupled with an em phasis on the relationship among almanacs, serves as the focus of a new commentary of the Madrid Codex by G. Vail &amp; C. Hern?ndez (unpublished manuscript). Their research en compasses not only the Maya codices, but also the Borgia group of codices (discussed below) because of cognates occurring in the two manuscript traditions. The best known of these are on page 1 of the Codex Fej?rv?ry Mayer (FM) from the Borgia group and M. 75-76. Vail &amp; Hern?ndez (2006) interpret both almanacs as Calendar Round instru ments depicting Wayeb' and New Year's cer emonies. In concert with the research described above, Vail &amp; Bricker (2004) recently docu mented the presence of more than 40 possi ble haaV dates in almanacs from the Madrid Codex (several of them had been previously noted; see Grana-Behrens 2002 and Vail &amp; Bricker 2004, table 7.1). This finding adds weight to recent proposals that Maya al manacs were not necessarily intended as re peating 260-day instruments but that many of them were anchored in time either sea sonally or according to the civic year (see www.annualreviews.org The Maya Codices 509</page><page sequence="14">V. Bricker &amp; H. Bricker 1992, Vail &amp; Aveni 2004). Maya-Highland Mexican Connections Another significant development in Maya codical studies involves a new perspective on scribal and elite interchange in Late Postclas sic Mesoamerica, as suggested by the shared intellectual content of almanacs in the Maya and Borgia group of codices from highland Mexico. The seven members of the latter group share components of a similar style as well as a number of cognate almanacs, despite the fact that they were very likely produced over a broad region including the Valley of Mexico, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Oaxaca, and possibly the Gulf coast (Boone 2003, p. 214). Thomas (1884) and Seler (1902-1923, 1:618-67; 1904) were the first to comment on parallels between almanacs in the Borgia group and those in the Maya codices, includ ing the correspondences between FM 1 and M. 75-76 discussed above and others between the Venus table in the Dresden Codex and a series of almanacs in the Borgia and Vaticanus B. codices. Studies by twentieth-century com mentators also drew attention to ties between the two codex traditions. Rather than focus ing on specific almanacs, however, they are of a more general nature, emphasizing paral lels between Maya and Mexican deities, re ligion, and cosmology (see, e.g., Nowotny 1961; Taube 1992; Thompson 1934, 1970). Specific comparisons include the identifica tion of central Mexican deities in the Dresden Venus table (Riese 1982, Taube &amp; Bade 1991, Whittaker 1986), the use of the A-O year sign (a Mixtee convention) in several almanacs in the Madrid Codex (H. Bricker et al. 1997, Vail 1997b), spacers similar to those used in the Borgia group in the Grolier Codex (Carlson 1983), and closely similar intervallic pattern ing in the two manuscript traditions (Aveni 2004). More recently, scholars have begun to ap ply the methodology used for dating Maya almanacs to the Borgia group (Aveni 1999, V Bricker 2001, Hern?ndez 2004) and have returned to the earlier focus on documenting specific connections between almanacs in the Maya codices (particularly the Madrid) and the Borgia group (Boone 2003; Drapkin 2002; Hern?ndez &amp; Bricker 2004; Just 2000, 2004; Vail &amp; Hern?ndez 2006). Just (2000, 2004) comments on four almanacs in the Madrid Codex that share a format typical of members of the Borgia group: an in extenso layout that allows the explicit recording of each day of the 260-day ritual calendar. His interest cen ters on why the Late Postclassic Maya adopted particular central Mexican forms such as this one. One possibility he proposes is that an in extenso format permits the recording of a va riety of events or activities for a given interval of time, allowing multiple cycles to be repre sented simultaneously. Just (2000, p. 14) believes that the use of central Mexican calendrical structures pro vides evidence for interaction between the Maya area and highland Mexico that was based not solely on political or military con cerns, but also on the exchange of ideas about time and methods for recording it. M. Macri (submitted manuscript) examines other evi dence for Maya-central Mexican connections in her study of possible borrowings from a Nahua language in the Maya codical texts. Research by Drapkin (2002) and Hern?ndez &amp; Bricker (2004) demonstrates that a num ber of the Madrid almanacs can be under stood in terms of a highland Mexican model. Hern?ndez &amp; Bricker (2004, pp. 306-9) note, for example, that the Madrid yearbearer pages incorporate dates that occur throughout the year (haab') in question, not simply those related to the inauguration of a new year bearer. This is similar to almanacs in the Bor gia Codex, such as B. 49-52, which reference both planting and New Year's events. The iconographie, calendrical, and struc tural parallels detailed in these studies have led $io Vail</page><page sequence="15">*?r*V# ?^V ^awaaapRrS, ?awas^;. ?es?? m0i /Efl? .-sTOsait?a ?HS? &gt;2 9t : * *J ?i** fT*?cr* Figure 3 A yearbearer ceremony depicted on M. 51b.

C-2 Vail</page><page sequence="17">researchers to conclude that they are not the result of a pan-Mesoamerican tradition, but rather that "some form of scribal translation took place, in which the author or authors of the Madrid Codex reconfigured the infor mation on several pages of the Borgia Codex (or a closely related manuscript) into a Maya format" (Hern?ndez &amp; Bricker 2004, p. 314). How this happened remains to be determined. We know that there were extensive commer cial ties between parts of highland Mexico and the northern Maya lowlands during the Post classic period (see, e.g., Milbrath &amp; Peraza Lope 2003, Smith &amp; Berdan 2003). Perhaps as a result, other exchange networks developed, including one that focused on intellectual in terchange among scribes, artists, and other members of the elite. To address this ques tion more fully, Dumbarton Oaks is sponsor ing a symposium in the fall of 2006 concern ing Late Postclassic interaction between the Mexican highlands and the Yucat?n peninsula. Researchers will examine the relevant archae ological, iconographie, linguistic, and textual data to develop testable hypotheses about the types and levels of interaction that may have played a role in the composition of the Late Postclassic codices. Online Resources and Future Directions for Research Another recent innovation in codical studies is the online Maya Codices Database (Vail &amp; Hern?ndez 2005), developed with fund ing from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The first version, consisting of a searchable database of the Madrid Codex, was made available online in the fall of 2002 (Vail 2002b) on Dumbarton Oak's Web site. It was recently updated to expedite research inquiries pertaining to the manuscript's hiero glyphic texts. Among the resources available to codical specialists, the database is unique in provid ing a comprehensive "catalog" of the con tent of the Maya codices (organized accord ing to dates, iconography, hieroglyphic texts, and themes) and a mechanism to search for particular data sets (e.g., all examples of the rain deity Chaak) or the intersection of such sets (e.g., all examples of Chaak holding an axe, or all examples of Chaak that occur on a particular date in the tzolkHn or haah1). Data from the Madrid Codex are currendy avail able for searching; data entry for the other three Maya codices is scheduled for comple tion by December 2006. The database offers exciting opportuni ties for future research, allowing the pos sibility of making further breakthroughs in each of the areas currendy under investi gation (calendrical interrelationships among codical almanacs, linguistic studies of the hi eroglyphic texts, etc.), as well as in areas of study that may emerge in the coming years. Vail and Hern?ndez envision a series of simi lar databases?pertaining to the Borgia group codices, Maya mural art, and Late Postclassic material culture?to facilitate research con cerning religion, ideology, trade, and related topics in the Late Postclassic Mesoamerican world. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The past decade of research has been char acterized by innovative methodologies for contextualizing iconographie studies of the Maya codices through new techniques for an alyzing the hieroglyphic texts and calendri cal structures of codical almanacs. Discus sions of the scribal tradition and provenience and dating issues have served to reintegrate codical research into the broader tradition of Mesoamerican studies. The emphasis on Maya-highland Mexican interaction opens the door to a reexamination of issues of ex change and interchange among Late Postclas sic cultures in Mesoamerica in ways not pre viously possible. Future research along these lines will broaden our perspective not only of the Mesoamerican world, but also of cultural interaction more generally. www.annualreviews.org The Maya Codices 511</page><page sequence="18">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am grateful to the National Endowment for the Humanities for their support of my research on the Maya codices in the form of grants RZ-20724-01 (2001-2002), FB-50332-04 (2004-2005), and RZ-50311-04 (2004-2006); to Ty Giltinan and Christine Hern?ndez for collaborating with me on the Maya Codices Database Project; to Cynthia Vail and William Werner for their editorial assistance; and to the following colleagues for their comments on an earlier draft of my review: Anthony Aveni, Harvey M.
