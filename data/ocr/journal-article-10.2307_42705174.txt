Is it a game? Is it serious? Is it near or far? We do not know. But we do know that Augustine obliged, as if to a call from Heaven. The sensitive saint knew the stakes. Sartre, too, knew the stakes, and new them well. And he, too, listened to children's voices, voices immanent, if not immi- nent. The boy thief, Genet. The boy idiot, Gustave. To say nothing of the boy scribbler, Poulou. Bastard, second-born, stepchild. And he lis- tened to the voices of the marginalized. The alienated. The laborer. The poor. The tortured. The oppressed. The wretched of the Earth. Their calls were not from beyond. They cried out - they cry out - from right here in the house just next door. And Sartre obliged their calls with a lifelong reading of this, our , human condition, and of this, our , human prospect. It is at once a worthy reading of an imperfect condition, and an imperfect reading of a worthy condition. As readers of this journal know, if he was sometimes importandy wrong, still, Sartre was often right about the most important things. But we also know that he did not make it easy for us. Thankfully, dili- gent readers of every stripe - lay persons, students, and scholars alike - all have a worthy helpmate in Joseph Catalano. If anyone has heeded the call to "take up and read" the thousands upon thousands of pages of Sartre's oeuvre, and to read them again and again and again, Catalano has. When he says, in passing, "I have read the work many times" (142), we believe him. And it is no exaggeration to say that many thousands of readers have benefited from Catalano's metic- ulous commentaries on Being and Nothingness (1974) and Critique of Dialectical Reason , Volume I (1986), to say nothing of his interpretive and critical explorations in Good Faith and Other Essays (1996), his ontology of knowing in Thinking Matter (2000), and his essays on reading, writing, and literature, among other topics, quiedy nested in Sartre Studies International Volume 1 7, Issue 2,2011:81-88 doi:10.3167/ssi.201 1.170206 ISSN 1357-1559 (Print), ISSN 1558-5476 (Online)</page><page sequence="2">Review Essay the academic foliage. Readers of Catalano's latest work on Sartre will not be disappointed. Indeed, Reading Sartre is a remarkable book. For Catalano as it was for Sartre, one thing is immediately clear: "It is impossible to get away from the problem of Truth" (119).1 Catalano reassures us, "I would not have spent so much of my life reading and thinking about Sartre's thought if I did not think that it is, for the most part, true." Then he summons us, This truth, however, is not something closed; it is itself an invitation. You may wish to read more deeply about Sartre yourself, and even in these brief reflections, you may discover that Sartre can help you, as he has helped me, understand more fully our place in this strange and wonderful world in which we live, (ix) These words, calm and direct and clear, should suffice as a tonic to the tendency of many to think of Sartre as somehow fundamentally wrong. In any case, these words set the tone for the entire work. After all, "there is nothing to be gained by considering Sartre a fool" (49). Catalano's fascination with and appreciation of both Sartre and this strange and wonderful world are evident throughout the book, and help to draw the reader along the spiral path he has charted through Sartre's four major systematic works. We are at once capti- vated by the simple ambition of Reading Sartre : "I seek understand- ing rather than criticism" (ix); comforted by the simple imperative that orients it: "The real task is to make sense of the text" (x); and challenged by the simplicity of its animating emotion: "Let empathy be our guide" (198). It is a fascinating promise. The reader is immediately intrigued. Catalano will read the four works - The Family Idiot, St. Genet, Cri- tique of Dialectical Reason ; and Being and Nothingness - first in this order, and then in reverse. He will take us from the end of Sartre's career to the beginning, and then from beginning to end. What will this mean? In Part I, "A retrospective overview", Catalano moves backwards, only to move forwards again, in Part II, "The works themselves." But what will this mean? Sure, Catalano cheats a bit when he keeps "the study of Genet... close to the study of Flaubert" (x). The methodological purist may feel a bit miffed by this bend in the chronological path, but it is no bait-and-switch. Catalano has his reasons, even if he does not reveal them completely, saying only, "I thought it appropriate to consider the two philosophical biographies close together" (137). That is all. And it does seem appropriate enough, even if one can imagine good reasons to hold to the origi- nal order of publication. What Catalano says regarding Sartre's own expectations of his readers holds no less for readers of Reading -82-</page><page sequence="3">Review Essay Sartre : "to read in good faith is to read what is written in the way it is written, heeding the author's own logic" (96, emphasis added). Catalano sees this logic as more than chrono'og'cz'. And so his reading in Part I makes its way through the philosophical biogra- phies and into the philosophical treatises, then back again in Part II through the treatises and into the biographies. Again, what will this mean? It may help to see the table of contents: PART ONE: A RETROSPECTIVE OVERVIEW 1 . The Family Idiot 2. Saint Genet: Actor and Martyr 3. The Critique of Dialectical Reason 4. Being and Nothingness PART TWO: THE WORKS THEMSELVES 1 . Being and Nothingness 2. The Critique of Dialectical Reason 3. Saint Genet: Actor and Martyr 4. The Family Idiot: Part One - Constitution 5. The Family Idiot: Concluded All of this is preceded by a short preface that situates the work within Catalano's personal and intellectual life, and followed by a short "afterword" on Madame Bovary , the purpose of which "is to acquire a firmer and clearer grasp of the exact meaning of Sartre's interpreta- tion, regardless of its truth, which I must leave to others to decide" (201). We are promised a spiral and this is what we get. Again, if it is not chronological, it is rigorously logical. And the reader is left to decide. In this sense, as in many others, Reading Sartre is a work in good faith. The tasks of the two parts are complementary. In Part I, we are given something of Catalano's overall interpretation of the four works under consideration. I say "something of' because it is clear that Catalano holds back. In each chapter and section he surely has much more to say, but he does not say it all. Again, he has his rea- sons. "I have no excuse, except that I do not wish to write another long book on Sartre's own big books" (150). (One can only wonder at all the things he wanted to say but deliberately left out, and at all the passages he considered commenting on, but did not.) Still, in this first part Catalano conveys something of the way - indeed, much of the way - in which Sartre managed to capture so much of what it means to be the sorts of beings that we are, in a world such as ours. Though he works first from the end to the beginning of Sartre's oeuvre, Catalano begins at our beginning: "A baby needs milk, love, -83-</page><page sequence="4">Review Essay and the names of things" (4). It is the baby Gustave, of course, but we were all babies. Milk, love, and names. We are immediately given a hint of three critical themes that will ground Catalano's interpreta- tion: scarcity, which he considers to be "the central theme of the entire Critique " (45, emphasis in original); the ontology of the Look, "one of Sartre's most important philosophical insights to which he returns throughout his life" (80); and Sartre's "pervasive" nominalism, "one of the most powerful intellectual tools guiding his reflections" (121). Catalano takes Sartre at his methodological word: "The point is to subordinate nothing a priori " (44). 2 And he follows through to the substantive letter, observing more than once that "the human race has the history it deserves to have" (44). This is one of Cata- lano's more pithy glosses on the entire Sartrean corpus. As he points out, "Of course, for Sartre, all methodology is one with the content of the work itself' (170). And so it is for Catalano. When we arrive at the midway point, halfway between departure and arrival (one is tempted to say, when we arrive at the point of no return), Catalano reminds us in no uncertain terms of the worldly relation that we are , and of the consequences of how we have thus far lived this relation : Trees and stars truly exist in the world, but only because we exist fractur- ing matter into things by our organic differentiating body. Humanity and subhumanity truly exist in the world, but only because we have individu- ally and collectively forged a world in which the sweat of the many bene- fits the few. (88) Part II takes up this relation and our history from the other direc- tion, from the beginning to the end of Sartre's oeuvre, and yet from our end to our beginning. Catalano leads us in with a well-known quote from Being and Nothingness: "My ultimate and initial pro- ject - for these are but one - is, we will see, always the oudine of a solution to the problem of being. But this solution is not first con- ceived and then realized; we are this solution" (92, emphasis added)3. In the light of this solution that we always already are - at least once we have encountered the look and have entered the citadel of language, according to Catalano - the second major subdivision of Reading Sartre offers "a more formal and somewhat more chrono- logical reflection" (91) on Sartre's four "big books." The goal of Part II is "to unveil the logic that underlies the works being consid- ered, while, hopefully, also deepening the understanding of their contents" (97, emphasis added). And so it does, provided we have taken seriously both Catalano's insistence that "Sartre writes books and he expects his readers to read whole books" (xi), and his insis- -84-</page><page sequence="5">Review Essay tence that Sartre is "a contextual writer and he expects you to keep this in mind." This, he argues, is "the natural function of a good reader" (84). From his conviction regarding the deep the logical structure of Being and Nothingness , to his effort to sort out and heuristically reconfigure the haphazard subdivisions of the Critique , to his appreciation of Sartre's playfulness in naming the chapters of Saint Genet , to his mild dissatisfactions with the divisions of the pub- lished volumes of The Family Idiot (three volumes in French, five in English), we are first shown the shape of these works, we see their "logic," and are then invited "to see, or feel, or even taste the flavor" (157) of Sartre's investigations. (Here, I should note that in Chapter 8, Catalano adopts the practice of placing "logic" in quotation marks, as he does twice in Chapter 9. Surely he has his reasons, but he does not share them.) What does this logic reveal? Minimally, we see that each of Sartre's "big books" has a signifi- cance that is only properly discernible in light of the whole, and which only discloses its true meaning in the context of the whole. Maximally, we see that each of the major works reveals us and our world, in its own way, from its own angle, and by its own distinctive means - phenomenological, ontological, historical, dialectical, psy- chological. We "taste" the peculiar relationship between each human being and this world, but "we must not lose sight of the individual" (143); and at the same time we "feel" the way each individual is wrapped up in something larger, "the way radical contingency can give rise to universality and necessity" (198). Reading Sartre is also a book , albeit not a "big book," and is best taken as a whole. The curious reader who only wishes to peruse will gain much. The reader who takes the time to read the whole will gain vastly more. I cannot know what it would be like to read Read- ing Sartre as a first exposure to Sartre's thought, but I would wager that the diligent novice would gain more than the most expert of dabblers. This is one book that can truly be of interest to both beginner and expert (unlike the many that are promised to be on behalf of the marketing department). At least four undercurrents help to bind Reading Sartre into the whole that it is. First, as Cata- lano notes in different ways, we must always take seriously Sartre's central insight in Transcendence of the Egoy "that we understand our- selves more intimately, but not necessarily more truly than others understand us" (25; see also 12,144). This means, among other things, that we can know and understand each other. No small thing. Second, and related to this latter point, Catalano agrees with Sartre that even if "all we have are human efforts... these efforts have -85-</page><page sequence="6">Review Essay given our world to us and ...we can understand our own handi- work" (119). In short, we can make sense of world we have made. Third, Catalano shares with Sartre the conviction that we can change ourselves and our world for the better: "[Sartre's] message is clear and insistent: We are collectively responsible not only for our own humanity, but for that of everyone" (112). As always, nested in this Sartrean staple is the Kantian "you must, therefore you can." Of course, when we do manage to improve our humanity, and thereby that of others, it tends to involve more than a little imagination, which brings us to the fourth undercurrent. Imagination may well be the aquifer from which Reading Sartre draws its sustenance - the source of its undercurrents and tributaries, and its main artery. The terms "imaginary," "imagination," and/or "imagine" occur on at least thirty-eight pages of the work (the only relatively sustained discussions occur in a few pages in chapters 2 and 9, not surprisingly, in discussions of Genet and Flaubert respec- tively). Imagination is a hugely important matter, for Sartre as it is for Catalano, who warns on numerous occasions of the dangers of worshipping "the god of the imaginary" (191). This god is only a devil in disguise, and Catalano does not mince words: "Evil is the love of the imaginary over the real" (159; see also 192). As is well known, in The Imaginary , Sartre posits rigid phenome- nological distinctions (arguably too rigid from a »^r^phenomeno- logical perspective) among perception and imagination and conception. Yet he notes more than once their mutual influence, and even hints here and there at the promise of their productive interac- tion. While the inherent tensions in Sartre's account encourage his own ambivalence toward the imaginary, this ambivalence is no mere waffling or fence-sitting. Like all warranted worry, Sartre's (and Catalano's) ambivalence toward the imaginary finds its roots in the lived experience of very real ambiguities in the real world. Of course, "There will always be ambiguity," Catalano reminds us, "but, in its proper context, a certain ambiguity is the condition of human life" (77). If Sartre saw a radical gap between imagination and percep- tion, still, he acknowledged a certain capacity of the imagination to refine and concentrate the percept, and by extension, one imagines, to refine and concentrate our concepts. Despite (or because of?) the tensions and ambivalence, Sartre unequivocally affirmed a common ground between the imaginary and the perceptual, in so far as both the percept and the image possess a real being. In this way, both the real and the "irreal" are "reals" And if, as Catalano notes in his sec- ond chapter on Saint Genet , "Freedom needs something to work -86-</page><page sequence="7">Review Essay upon" (156), sometimes that something is the imaginary. After all, "Sartre reminds us [in Saint Genet ] of the general give and take between the real and the imaginary: To imagine is to give the imagi- nary a bit of the real to chew at'" (31). All good things to those who wait? It seems doubtful. But good things, surely, to at least some who imagine. It is perhaps they, above all, who "accept the essential gamble inherent in the nature of human freedom" (50), provided they do not lose sight of the real. If it still needs to be said, Reading Sartre is no mere monograph. Yes, it is a scholarly work, and in the best sense of the term. It is focused, structured, and erudite. But is also a deeply personal book. How could it not be? After all, it is not only a book about Sartre, it is a book about being human and all of history, and about being Genet, and all of Flaubert. Amidst these universal themes and singu- lar individuals, Catalano, himself, comes to the surface now and again, like a dolphin popping up for air between long and deep pas- sages. We see him thinking not just about Sartre, but with him, sometimes beyond him. And sometimes we meet Catalano face to face. Of robots, he quips: "Let the robots and machines do whatever they can do for us - here I speak for myself' (35). Of the Heidegger- ian Mitsein : "Sartre finds all of this hard to swallow, and so do I" (81). Of pre-reflective consciousness and our worldly bond: "...bit- ing into the apple I get to know myself as a taster of apples - per- haps, after all, wine is a better example" (99). Of the managerial class: "And, if I may add a thought: 'Management,' in all its perva- sive forms, is taking to itself an excessive part of the financial rewards" (117, note 7). Of Soviet bombs, guns, and rocket ships: "Perhaps these were needed to protect the country from the West, but - and here I speak for myself - I have always thought that it was foolish" (135). Of revolutionary action: "I do not recommend this course of action: I merely point to our mass slumber in a world of conflict that we ourselves have collectively forged" (129). These glimpses of Joseph Catalano, the man, are refreshing to the reader, as they were no doubt to the writer as he wrote them. Reading Sartre has many merits. Not the least of these is the way it shows, rather than tells of, the methodological and substantive thread that binds the "early Sartre" to the "mature Sartre," descrip- tors Catalano himself would never use. It also shows the way in which Catalano (like Sartre) gathers together seemingly disparate phenomena into a logical and comprehensible whole - life, politics, history, language, things. Perhaps above all, Reading Sartre shows how Catalano skillfully escapes the hubris and myopia of mere -87-</page><page sequence="8">Review Essay anthropomorphism, and promotes an open-ended and roomy humanism that places our kind squarely, not exclusively, into the fray - what Catalano is glad to call "anthropocentrism," and else- where works out under the banner of "relational realism."4 In truth, this latter notion is arguably the central leitmotif of Reading Sartre (discussed explicidy at least nine times, and implicitly or indirectly on dozens of pages). Catalano is unequivocal when he concludes that, "All of Sartre's thought from Being and Nothingness to The Family Idiot can be summarized in the simple claim that the world is the way it is because we are the way we are" (88). Whether he would have us revolt or not, Catalano (like Sartre) would have us awaken to this blinding glimpse of the obvious. Not incidentally, I think, the three strengths of Catalano's spiral reading mirror the core strengths of the Sartrean oeuvre itself, to wit, its continuity, its integrativity, and above all, its humanity. But enough. What Catalano says of Critique of Dialectical Reason can just as well be said of Reading Sartre : "It was a risk born of freedom and in recognition of freedom" (136). What Sartre demands of the writer can just as well be said of Catalano: "For Sartre, the commit- ted writer invites the reader to become engaged in changing the world toward a more human condition, without, however, preaching this message" (201). And what Catalano says of Sartre's big books, I will say of Catalano's smaller ones: "These works continue to nour- ish my own thinking about the world" (ix). We may not agree with everything he says, about Sartre or the world, but our task "is not to approve but to understand" (146). Tolle lege ? Indeed, and "Let empathy be our guide" (198). Matthew C.
