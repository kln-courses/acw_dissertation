<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS: A BEHAVIORAL THEORY OF WHY CORPORATIONS MISLEAD STOCK MARKET INVESTORS (AND CAUSE OTHER SOCIAL HARMS) DONALD C. LANGEVOORTt Rationality is a strong assumption in the legal literature about how corporations and other organizations behave in market settings. The modern transaction-cost economics on which most contemporary corporate scholarship is based' concedes that the rationality of offi- cers, directors, and other managers is "bounded" (that is, that they do not have perfect information or unlimited time, skill, and attention) and acknowledges that these agents have self-interests that differ from those of their firms' owners.2 Because of these limits and the imper- t Lee S. &amp; Charles A. Speir Professor, Vanderbilt University School of Law. The author would like to thankJim Cox, Eric Orts, and the many participants at workshops and presentations at Stanford University, the University of Michigan, and the Univer- sity of Illinois for their very helpful comments. I This literature is sufficiently pervasive that it hardly needs extensive citation; key legal texts in corporate law include FRANK H. EASTERBROOK &amp; DANIEL R. FISCHEL, THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF CORPORATE LAW (1991); PRINCIPALS AND AGENTS (John W. Pratt &amp; Richard J. Zeckhauser eds., 1985); ROBERTA ROMANO, THE GENIUS OF AMERICAN CORPORATE LAW (1993); and Symposium, Contractual Freedom in Corporate Law, 89 COLUM. L. REV. 1395 (1989). This is not to say that it is uncontroversial; legal critics have questioned its power and accuracy from any number of perspectives. See, e.g., Douglas M. Branson, The Death of Contractualism and the Vindication of Structure and Authority in Corporate Law Governance and Corporate Law, in PROGRESSIVE CORPORATE LAW 93, 93, 105 (Lawrence Mitchell ed., 1995) (arguing that law-and-economics theo- ries do not adequately justify a hands-off approach to corporate law, so that"[t]here must be structure and a core of principles and authority in corporate law"). But most critiques focus primarily on the ineffectiveness of contract as a mechanism for recon- ciling the competing interests, see, e.g., id. at 94 (arguing that "[u]nder a contractarian scheme, all but larger minority interests ... would be discouraged"), leading to the view that absent legally imposed restraints, managers really are entrenched and free to act selfishly and antisocially, cf. id. at 97 (noting that "there exist some immutable rules and principles that govern behavior and check unbridled majority power in the corporate sphere"). See, e.g., OLIVER E. WILLIAMSON, ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS OF CAPITALISM 43-52 (1985) (discussing bounded rationality and "the behavioral assumptions imputed to contractual man"); Michael C. Jensen &amp; William H. Meckling, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure, 3 J. FIN.

But within such limitations, the world that is portrayed is still one of guileful rationality. Firms that depart too far or too often from this norm will lose access to needed capital and succumb to their more savvy competitors. Managers are presumed to understand this and act accordingly. Borrowing from an explosion of work by social scientists on hu- man judgment and decisionmaking, legal scholars have been increas- ingly willing to rethink strong assumptions of rationality in the con- 3 text of individual behavior, even within markets. They have not yet mined to any depth, however, an equally rich vein of research on or- ganizational rationality.4 Yet here we find the skeptic's mother lode: 3 In the past decade, there has been a burgeoning literature in both law and eco- nomics on human decisionmaking and the possibility for heuristics and biases to op- erate instead of conventional Bayesian rationality. For reviews of some of this research within the social sciences, see Colin Camerer, Individual Decision Making, in THE HANDBOOK OF EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS 587 (John H. Kagel &amp; Alvin E.

Notwithstanding the problems associated with its definition, I will use rationality in its standard economic sense. 4 In criminal law, organization theory has had a considerable impact due largely to the long-standing interest of sociologists in white-collar crime.

This literature seeks to identify the social cognitions and norm structures' within organizations that can lead to a "loose coupling" between day-to-day activities and instrumental ra- tionality for reasons that go well beyond managerial opportunism.6 It works from the assumption that these social forces are sufficiently natural and ingrained that they cannot readily be eliminated by struc- tural or contractual design, and sufficiently contingent on the per- sonnel in place at any given time and the situation in which the firm therefore seek to optimize whatever conditions within the system most inhibit the dis- approved conduct"); Diane Vaughn, Toward Understanding Unlawful Organizational Be- havior, 80 MICH.

Even here, however, there has been more emphasis on the orthodox sociological concep- tion of the firm as opposed to the new institutionalism's focus on cognitions and belief structures. 5 Both individual ("micro") and broad social behaviors ("macro") are the subject of inquiry within this literature; the micro-macro distinction, though fuzzy, is a com- mon one. The macro-behavioral accounts (which traditionally have been dominant) are largely sociological in nature, emphasizing the cultural forces that dominate the cognitions and behaviors of individual actors. See Alison Davis-Blake &amp; Jeffrey Pfeffer, Just a Mirage: The Search for Dispositional Effects in Organizational Research, 14 ACAD. MGMT. REV. 385, 397 (1989) (criticizing an organizational-behavior research approach that "tends to allow organizational participants to escape responsibility for the systems they design"). The micro-behavioral emphasis, which draws heavily from the social- cognition branch of psychology that is having such an impact in law and economics, looks at individual cognitive traits to see how these can affect the behavior of the larger organization.

Competitive forces are not irrelevant, but are only part of a complex set of institu- tional influences that operates over the entire marketplace.7 This research affects a good bit of what is taught as organizational behavior in business schools. There, managerial rationality tends to be treated more as a holy grail than as an observable reality. Empiri- cal case studies abound of systemic decisionmaking flaws, with many of the examples drawn from companies hardly destined for Darwin- ian extinction. Take, for instance, Robert Burgelman's study of Intel Corporation's loss of a strong competitive advantage over a twenty- year period (roughly 1971-1991) in the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) market.8 Ultimately, Intel recognized the error and successfully repositioned itself in the microprocessor business.9 In the end, then, Intel did adapt; no doubt market discipline drove the hard lesson. But the interesting questions are why it took so long, and whether it could happen to Intel again in some different context. To offer answers to these questions here would be to give away too much of what is to follow in this Article. Suffice it to say that many organiza- tional theorists suggest that the cognitive and informational difficul- ties that overcame Intel are pervasive and commonplace. Much of their theory is social constructionist, going to how organizations per- ceive themselves, their goals, and their environment, and the poten- tial for myths in conditions of high ambiguity.'0 See Paul J. DiMaggio &amp; Walter W. Powell, Introduction to THE NEW INSTITU- TIONALISM, supra note 6, at 1, 32 ("Rather than deny the importance of competition, institutional theorists now emphasize the historical and intersocietal variability of competitive regimes and the role of institutions in constituting those regimes.").

The most common sort of large-scale class-action lawsuit alleging se- curities fraud is one brought against a public corporation and its sen- ior management for concealing bad news from investors, even though the company was not in the process of selling its own shares at the time. This nonprivity "fraud-on-the-market"" case typically involves some form of product or financial degeneration kept from public view until the last possible moment, leading to a rapid decline in the market price of the stock once the adverse information is disclosed, and a set of unhappy investors who bought at a time, they suspect, when the issuer's managers knew of the problems but nonetheless kept an optimistic public face." Scores of cases decided by the courts each year under the principal antifraud provision of the SEC's regula- tions, Rule lOb-5,13 fall into this category. In 1995, Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act'4 largely to deal with per- ceived abuses associated with this kind of lawsuit.'5 Under the fraud-on-the-market theory, investors who buy or sell in an efficient market after some material misrepresentation or omission are presumed to have relied upon it, a presumption that is all but unrebuttable in fact. See, e.g., JAMES D. COX ET AL., SECURITIES REGULATION 753 (2d ed. 1997) ("Because most publicly available in- formation is reflected in market price, an investor's reliance on any public material misrepresentations, therefore, may be presumed for purposes of a Rule 10b-S5 ac- tion."). The result is that the class of investors who can recover, and thus the aggre- gate amount of recovery, is potentially very large. 12A standard example is In re Apple Computer Securities Litigation, 886 F.2d 1109 (9th Cir. 1989). See infra note 157 and accompanying text; see also Robert A. Prentice &amp; John H. Langmore, Beware of Vaponvare: Product Hype and the Securities Fraud Liability of High-Tech Companies, 8 HARv.J.L. &amp; TECH. 1, 4 (1994) (discussing product hype in rela- tion to Rule 10b-S5 and Apple).

Langevoort, Theories, Assumptions, and Securities Regula- tion: Market Efficiency Revisited, 140 U. PA. L. REv. 851 (1992).

If Intel's business judgment was skewed by predictable social forces, its economic self-portrait in disclosure about its business prospects perhaps was as well.16 This insight helps us solve a puzzle. From a rational standpoint, why would public companies ever deliberately lie to investors when, because they are neither buy- ing nor selling stock in the open market, there is nothing directly to gain? When done intentionally, such activity is clearly unlawful and policed fairly visibly both by the SEC and the private plaintiffs' class- action bar. Yet cases of alleged deception seem to persist in large numbers. Of course, anything but the most strained anthropomor- phic conception of the firm leads us quickly to observe that corpora- tions cannot tell lies-only their managers can. The question of mo- tivation, then, becomes largely a managerial one. But conventional economic analysis, at least, tells us that the interests of the company's highest executives are usually (albeit not always) fairly closely aligned with the ongoing interests of the firm, so that the question of why sen- ior managers would engage in secondary-market deception remains an interesting one. This is especially so when one considers that in most bad-news scenarios, concealment simply delays the appreciation of the truth rather than avoids it indefinitely,'7 so that there are ad- verse reputational as well as legal consequences from concealing the truth. The question has practical importance. From the standpoint of securities-litigation policy, a conclusion that managers seldom have a strong motive to lie under the prevailing regulatory framework (or have such motive only in special, confined circumstances) might lead us to doubt the merits of many of the fraud-on-the-market lawsuits brought today. This would lend inferential support to the view that the bulk of these cases are brought extortionately for their settlement value,'8 and justify the kind of aggressive pruning of such actions that dence of speculative class action suits, while still preserving meaningful class action remedies for meritorious securities fraud claims"). 16 Because this analysis could not be done thoroughly and fairly from readily avail- able sources, I have made no effort to determine whether Intel's publicity was actually distorted. 17 See In reTime Warner Inc. Sec. Litig., 9 F.3d 259, 272-75 (2d Cir. 1993) (Winter, J., dissenting) (arguing that the timing of bad news is irrelevant due to the efficient- market hypothesis). 18 CfJ Joseph A.

Conversely, identifying a broader set of plausible motivations would suggest that there might well be plenty of securities fraud around, suggesting the need for care in the reform efforts lest too much deterrence be lost. This Article seeks to provide a robust set of explanations for why managers of a public corporation would mislead stock market inves- tors either in their filings or in ongoing publicity efforts. Part I be- gins by tracing the intellectual history of prior answers to this ques- tion. As we shall see, there are very good-but confined- explanations within the framework of conventional economic analy- sis, particularly the thesis advocated by Jennifer Arlen and William Carney'9 that in the face of the sort of liability now imposed for securi- ties fraud (which is almost exclusively vicarious), open-market lies are predictable if (but largely only if) the top managers see themselves as facing a "last period problem" wherein the disclosure of the truth would result in insolvency and hence the loss of their jobs. The pri- mary use of institutionalist organization theory here is simply to em- phasize that the cost-benefit calculation that managers face when de- ciding whether to lie is a complex one: Firms have multiple constituencies, and lies that influence investors may really be directed at other audiences (for example, customers or employees) in order to prevent "runs" on external or internal resources. We then turn to alternative stories that draw from materials that, as noted above, blend the insights of sociology and social psychology with economic analysis. Part II will move only slightly, if at all, from the world of economics in utilizing this literature. Part II extends the agency-cost analysis by raising the possibility that some forms of mis- leading may be traceable not to the distortion of information by the senior managers themselves but by arguably selfish distortions by lower-level managers in the flow of information that moves up to sen- ior management. The interesting question here is whether the result- ing misinformation to the marketplace is securities fraud at all. Part III is the heart of this Article and will make much greater use of institutional theory as it has evolved in work on organizations out- side of mainstream economics. Organizations are not the product of private rights should be administratively disimplied). This is not the only inference, of course: Deficiencies in the prevailing regulatory structure could also play a role. 19 SeeJennifer H. Arlen &amp; William J. Carney, Vicarious Liability for Fraud on Securities Markets: Theory and Evidence, 1992 U. ILL. L.

Here, we see the possibility that managers simply might not recognize problems or risks because of systematic "perceptual filters"20 that play crucial protective roles in the smooth functioning of the firm. My most provocative hypothesis is that cor- porate cultural biases, particularly optimistic ones, can be adaptive mechanisms for encouraging trust and cooperation, and for deflect- ing the selfishness-inducing last-period problem that arises in times of stress and threat. If so, then such cultures should be commonplace and persistent. This possibility is interesting especially when com- bined with the problems specified in Parts I and II. The last-period and information-flow questions become even more complex and fas- cinating if we predict that cognitive biases affect the perceptions of those involved in both the information flow and disclosure processes. Though this Article is specifically directed at the problem of secu- rities fraud, my broader aim is to invoke the new institutionalist litera- ture in a way that makes clear its usefulness in a wide range of legal settings,2' and thereby prompt a research agenda to build on this genre of organization theory. The transaction-cost economics of Oliver Williamson, Michael Jensen, and others has justifiably had a profound influence on many legal subjects, not just corporate law. One can hardly criticize this investment of intellectual capital, except to the extent that it purports to be preemptive. Williamson and 20 See William H. Starbuck &amp; Frances J.

Why might corpo- rations not act "rationally" in avoiding socially harmful, unlawful ac- tivities such as the production of dangerous products or the discharge of toxic waste? I. WHY LIE? THE PREVAILING ACCOUNTS Securities "lies" come in a variety of forms. One can misrepresent hard data (for example, lie about accounting results or a large con- 22 See George P.

Williamson ed., 1990) ("A fruitful dialogue be- tween economics and organization is progressively taking shape."). The tribute to the work of Chester Barnard organized by Williamson, see id., is an excellent dialogue be- tween economists and a diverse group of other social scientists about the opportuni- ties to advance organization theory via multidisciplinary work. In fact, economists have been much quicker to incorporate these multidisciplinary perspectives into their work than economics-oriented legal scholars. See Langevoort, supra note 12, at 857-72 (surveying use of social and psychological research in finance theory). Modern insti- tutional economics is notable for its emphasis on historical and social theories (for example, evolutionary and path-dependent development) even when it does not make specific use of psychology or sociology. For law-oriented surveys, see RonaldJ. Gilson, Corporate Governance and Economic Efficiency: WMen Do Institutions Matter?, 74 WASH. U. L.Q. 327 (1996), and Rubin, supra note 21. 23 A predictable but crucial disclaimer is necessary here. There is no singular model of organizational behavior in the new institutional literature: The underlying theories and assumptions are controversial and often highly contingent. The field is still relatively young. My aim here is to invoke that literature as the basis for promising insights for legal scholars and decisionmakers, without claiming that it can be demon- strated empirically to be more valid than the economists' competing model of instru- mental rationality. Citations are offered not to claim that an assertion is clearly cor- rect but rather to demonstrate respectable academic support for this institutional literature's plausibility.</page><page sequence="10">110 UNIVERSITY OFPENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 tract that supposedly was agreed to with an important customer). Most information in SEC filings is of this sort. But many lies that seemingly have the capacity to affect the stock markets14 are much "softer"-involving subjective matters of opinion or inference.25 A company will be charged with withholding adverse information about whether a new product is likely to succeed, or whether cash flow is sufficient to buffer the firm through hard times. The underlying hard facts are interesting, that is, material, only for their predictive usefulness. In this sense, an important portion of the question of why companies allegedly lie to the stock markets can be recharacterized: Why do companies allegedly distort construals of their future pros- pects?26 That is our focus here. The earliest literature on securities law rarely contained much discussion of the motivational question. The increasing incidence of cases involving misinformation disseminated to the secondary mar- kets apparently led to an assumption that open-market fraud was a problem, without much specification beyond anecdotes as to why or how-even though, in the aftermath of the seminal Texas Gulf Sulphur 24 I accept that many forms of managerial "spin" will be discounted by professional investors. See infra text accompanying notes 196-97. 25 See COX ET AL., supra note 11, at 63-89 (discussing cases and materials dealing with speculative information and materiality, and forward-looking information); Victor Brudney, A Note on Materiality and Soft Information Under the Federal Securities Laws, 75 VA. L. REv. 723, 730-32 (1989) (discussing the concept of the materiality of soft or fu- ture-oriented information in the law of required disclosure). The Supreme Court has acknowledged that opinion-based disclosure can nonetheless be material, that is, the sort of assertion on which a reasonable investor might reasonably rely. See Virginia Bankshares v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083, 1090-91 (1991) ("We think there is no room to deny that a statement of belief by corporate directors about a recommended course of action, or an explanation of their reasons for recommending it, can take on just that importance [of materiality]."). 26 This portion is quite large when one considers that fundamental valuation techniques concentrate solely on the firm's expected stream of earnings, which is then discounted to present value. Present and historic facts are simply useful in helping estimate the future. See, e.g., WILLIAM A. KLEIN &amp; JOHN C. COFFEE, JR., BUSINESS ORGANIZATION AND FINANCE 304-15 (6th ed. 1996) (discussing and illustrating various valuation techniques).</page><page sequence="11">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 111 litigation,27 this kind of fraud allegation in many ways became the poster child for increasingly aggressive federal securities regulation.28 By the mid-1970s, economic analysis of corporate and securities regulation had taken hold, quickly turning what had been a relatively moribund body of scholarship into one visibly prized in the acad- emy.29 Given the strong emphasis on the comparative advantage of nonlegal, market-based constraints in controlling harmful forms of behavior, scholars naturally asked hard questions about the likely in- cidence of fraud and nondisclosure. Two rational-actor insights are central to understanding the issue. One is that active securities fraud, unlike other forms of wrongdoing (like embezzlement, price fixing, and toxic dumping) is necessarily public rather than private. Directly or indirectly, the insider must speak through some medium, such as the business press or invest- ment analysts, which can disseminate the fraud widely. Moreover, ac- tive securities fraud is largely within the control of a small group of senior managers, usually the only ones within the firm with enough credibility and access to information to be able to move market par- ticipants to cause significant price changes. In other words, a single manager is unlikely to have the opportunity to move the market, even if she wants to do so, without alerting other senior managers, who have the capacity to counter or deny the falsehood quickly. As such, one would expect that most successful frauds are committed with the 27 See SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 864 (2d Cir. 1968) (in banc) ("We conclude ... that, having established that the release was issued in a manner reasonably calculated to affect the market price of TGS stock and to influence the in- vesting public, we must remand to the district court to decide whether the release was misleading to the reasonable investor and if found to be misleading, whether the court in its discretion should issue the injunction the SEC seeks."). 28 See David S. Ruder, Texas Gulf Sulphur-The Second Round: Privity and State of Mind in Rule 10b-5 Purchase and Sale Cases, 63 Nw. U. L.

The other insight is that, collectively at least, this control group 31 has a natural incentive toward candor. Senior management's group interests are contractually aligned with the long-term success of the firm as reflected in its share price, and the firm benefits from a repu- tation for honesty. Since few problems can be concealed indefinitely, especially in an environment of mandatory disclosure, with the inter- vention of outside accountants and lawyers as well as aggressive scru- tiny by professional analysts, the reputational risk of concealment, both to the firm and its top executives, is palpable. To be sure, special circumstances exist that could tempt this group to choose the risk. The most obvious is the possibility of in- sider trading-well recognized today as the best motivational story a plaintiff can tell to justify a circumstantial case for fraud on the mar- ket.32 There is an immediate and potentially immense pecuniary gain for managers if they can buy or sell in advance of a market move- ment, tempting them to delay their truth-telling in order to fully ex- ploit the informational advantage. But we must be cautious about the plausibility of this kind of story. Given that some concerted effort by senior managers is usually required to distort the market successfully, there are difficult coordination problems that act as natural deter- rents to this kind of conspiracy.33 This kind of insider trading is un- ambiguously illegal and readily detectable when done on the kind of large scale necessary to support a broad conspiracy.34 31 See Frank H. Easterbrook &amp; Daniel R. Fischel, Mandatory Disclosure and the Protec- tion of Investors, 70 VA. L. REV. 669, 673-77 (1984) (describing management's interest in its own trustworthiness). 32 See, e.g., Rubinstein v. Collins, 20 F.3d 160, 169-70 (5th Cir. 1994) (noting the presumptive materiality of insider information). See generally Jordan Eth &amp; Michael Dicke, Insider Stock Sales in Rule 10b-5 Corporate Disclosure Cases: Separating the Innocent from the Suspicious, 1 STAN. J.L. BUS. &amp; FIN. 97, 98 (1994) (discussing corporate disclo- sure cases). Similarly, there would be an obvious pecuniary motivation to executives who are about to receive or cash in on stock options or comparable forms of compen- sation, or who wish to avoid the threat of a corporate takeover. A recent study finds little evidence of management's potentially manipulative timing of publicity as a means of maximizing compensation awards. See David Yermack, Good Timing: CEO Stock Option Awards and Company News Announcements, 52 J. FIN. 449, 473 (1997) (arguing against the theory that managers manipulate the timing of their news an- nouncements) . 33 Given the risk of detection, many executives who would otherwise be privy to the fraud would lack the sufficient self-interest to participate.

LANGEVOORT, INSIDER TRADING ? 1.04, at 1-23 (1997) (discussing how suspicious market-price movements can trigger SEC investigations).</page><page sequence="13">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 113 A more benign kind of temptation to lie or conceal information comes when there is some special corporate need to preserve secrecy.35 The best-known example here is the preliminary merger negotiation, 36 addressed in the Supreme Court's Basic Inc. v. Levinson decision. On the not unrealistic assumption that preliminary negotiations are more likely to occur and succeed if they proceed without the knowledge of potential competitors for corporate control, companies have a natural incentive to keep investors in the dark (and foreseeably hurt some relatively small category of sellers) in pursuit of the overriding aim of maximizing firm value. One can easily imagine other analogous ex- amples of this sort of deception. Scholars have debated the proper posture toward this situation; however, the Court in Basic made clear that utilitarian lying to cover up the negotiations may be illegal,37 even though mere silence probably is not.38 Once we assume illegality,39 we must again puzzle over why managers would rationally choose to run both the reputational and legal risk associated with lying when (the 35 See Marcel Kahan, Games, Lies, and Securities Fraud, 67 N.Y.U. L.

There are many other cases in which deceiving some other audience was the primary objective of the misstatement or omission. See, e.g., Heit v. Weitzen, 402 F.2d 909, 911 (2d Cir. 1968) (failing to disclose overcharges on government contracts). Basic generated an interesting debate about whether corpora- tions should have greater freedom to lie under the securities laws. See Ian Ayres, Back to Basics: Regulating How Corporations Speak to the Market, 77 VA. L. REV. 945, 946 (199 1) (asking whether "corporations should be allowed to lie to the market"); Kahan, supra note 35, at 752 (noting that securities law may unfairly burden a company's strategic planning); Jonathan R. Macey &amp; Geoffrey P. Miller, Good Finance, Bad Economics: An Analysis of the Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 42 STAN. L. REV. 1059, 1062 (1990) (discussing the gaps which the Basic decision leaves in the market-fraud theory). 37 485 U.S. at 239 ("Whether merger discussions in any particular case are material depends on the facts."). 38 See id. at 240 n.17 ("[W]e think that creating an exception to a regulatory scheme founded on a prodisclosure legislative philosophy, because complying with the regulation might be 'bad for business,' is a role for Congress, not this Court."). 39 Of course, the question of motivation depends on the nature of the liability scheme in question. If there is no liability at all for securities fraud, then the question is a simple calculus of whether the competitive benefits of secrecy exceed the reputa- tional harm. If we assume firm liability, then the question is whether these benefits exceed the sum of the liability and reputational harm. In turn, the predicted liability costs would take into account the less-than-perfect incidence of a lawsuit and the fact that such suits can commonly be settled for far less than their face value. See, e.g., Janet Cooper Alexander, Do the Merits Matter?: A Study of Settlements in Securities Class Actions, 43 STAN. L.

Here is where Arlen and Carney make their contribution.40 They hypothesize that so long as the interests of senior management are indeed aligned with the long-term interests of the firm, the incentive structure makes the probability of intentional deception somewhat unlikely.4' There will be one class of cases, however, where the moti- vational dynamics change considerably. If the senior management group believes that it faces the threat of company insolvency, with the high probability of group firing, then it will see the tradeoff for not lying as one of the threatened loss of salary, bonuses, and perquisites, plus any personal reputational damage resulting from such a termina- tion.4' That is a draconian threat indeed, and even a rational actor will be tempted to avoid it through concealment, either to buy time to create the possibility of a turnaround or simply to milk their positions for as long as possible.43 Arlen and Carney note that the legal deter- rence is minimal for selfish managers in light of the prevailing doc- trinal regime's strong bias toward vicarious liability,44 wherein nearly all settlements and judgments are paid either by the company itself or its director and officer liability insurer-not by the managers them- selves.45 Indeed, advocating a shift from vicarious to agent liability, a contrast with the orthodox preference in the law-and-economics lit- erature, is the central normative message of their article. We now have an account for some incidence of securities fraud, but the implication is that securities fraud is limited to special kinds of situations: particularly, when there is fear of being on the verge of 40 See Arlen &amp; Carney, supra note 19. For an endorsement of their view, see Reinier Kraakman et al., When Are Shareholder Suits in Shareholder Interests?, 82 GEO. L.J. 1733, 1760 n.80 (1994). 41 See Arlen &amp; Carney, supra note 19, at 702-03 (describing market-based con- straints) . 42 See id. at 693 (noting that "Fraud on the Market usually occurs when agents fear themselves to be in their last period of employment"). 43 See id. at 694 (arguing that generally fraud is committed by managers who want to conceal "that the firm is ailing in an attempt to save their jobs and their investments in the firm"). 44 See id. (arguing that agent liability is a better deterrent of fraud than enterprise liability). 45 One recent study shows that only 0.4% of the average settlement is paid by the human wrongdoers; the remainder is from the corporate treasury or insurance (the premiums for which were paid by the company).

DUNBAR ET AL., RECENT TRENDS III: WHAT EXPLAINS SETTLEMENTS IN SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTIONS? atv (1995).</page><page sequence="15">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 115 bankruptcy or some other last period, or when there is a strong com- petitive need for secrecy.46 The problem with this theory, however, is that it does not provide a compelling motivational story for the major- ity of cases that make up the class-action practice today, and that in- volve the management's concealment of product defects or the com- pany's financial difficulties that are unlikely to lead to insolvency. One need not invoke much alternative organizational theory to appreciate the thesis of Arlen and Carney. One suspects, however, that in one respect a company may have a more pervasive incentive to lie than Arlen and Carney imply. One of the primary lessons of the institutionalist literature-hardly inconsistent with modern economic analysis-is that firms operate in complex ecologies in which they compete for both legitimacy and scarce resources.47 The relevant "stakeholder" network includes the government, employees, custom- ers, suppliers, investors, and so forth. The management of the busi- ness requires constant care of all these relationships and occasional tradeoff of interests. Under these circumstances, it would not be sur- prising to find situations in which trading off credibility with (perhaps even the risk of liability to48) investors for some profit-enhancing gain in some other area could be a rational choice. When a company issues a press release, there are many different groups of audience, and no public form of communication is capable of simultaneously delivering one message to investors while sending a completely different message to another group. The financial press (for example, the Wall Street Journal or Business Week) is read by a wide variety of economic actors. The optimal form of publicity is one that best mediates the company's investor-relations interests with the full range of other business needs, adjusted to reflect whatever liability and reputational risks are associated with misleading any one class of actors. In the eyes of many students of business organizations, for ex- ample, there is a social imperative to style corporate publicity in a way 46 Arlen and Carney provide an empirical study of recent class-action litigation (excluding merger and acquisition activities) that purports to support this thesis. See Arlen &amp; Carney, supra note 19, at 720-34. They categorize a sample of recent cases and argue that a large portion can be fit into the "last period" category. See id. at 725-27. See, e.g., JEFFREY PFEFFER &amp; GERALD R.

Under these circumstances, an excessively opti- mistic "face" of the corporation could readily become the norm, and any corporation that defected from the norm by being entirely candid would suffer a penalty if the stock market had so internalized an ex- pectation of overoptimism that the truthful statement was taken as covering up a situation worse than depicted.

The idea that a norm of financial beautification through artificial accounting conventions can cause</page><page sequence="17">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 117 In moderate form, the multiple-audience problem could well be the story behind the "product fraud" cases that loom so large as secu- rities class actions. Many cases-In re Apple Computer Securities Litiga- tion" is a well-known example-have been based on a series of public statements regarding some product under development which has been greeted with great enthusiasm by the investing public but which then flops in the market. Some evidence is then found that problems were known to at least some managers at the time the optimism was being expressed. If we simply view this through the investor-company relationship lens, the fake optimism may seem puzzling, at least from a rational perspective. But it is not so puzzling if we see the false publicity as directed to other audiences. Disclosure by the company of problems could well trigger competitors' gaining advantages with retailers and customers (for example, loss of anticipated shelf space). Unless the problems are already common knowledge among employees, there could be a slippage in internal motivation and morale. In other words, the dis- closure could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, dooming whatever remaining chances of success the project has. More generally, disclo- sure of possibly insolvable problems and risks runs counter to the de- sired image of control treated by business theorists as so important in the competition for resources. Of course, there are possibly more selfish motivations at play here as well. Admission that an established project may be a failure is embarrassing to certain senior managers, threatening the prevailing political structure of the firm. However, we cannot assume that the desire to mislead is necessarily selfish.53 Nothing in the foregoing suggests that we should not attach liabil- ity consequences to these utilitarian sorts of lies.

Therefore, we should at least be careful that the compen- sation demanded in the name of securities regulation to the injured class is indeed limited to their real injuries, lest there be excessive de- terrence.

On the other hand, if some more sizable category of frauds really are business-motivated, then vicarious liabil- ity (at least if in an optimal amount) has far more to recommend it.59 II. EXTENDING THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: THE PROBLEM OF INFORMATION FLOW A. The Problem of Corporate Knowledge One subject on which there is substantial agreement over the full range of organization studies is that "upward" information flow poses a challenge for coherent corporate decisionmaking.60 Information is highly decentralized in business organizations. Especially when we focus on information and inferences that are not readily quantifi- able-for example, customer reactions to new products, how well products are proceeding through the research and development pipeline-relatively low- or mid-level managerial personnel will have detriment of those investors who require recovery in order to minimize precaution- taking"). The primary reasons are that most settlements and judgments are funded out of other innocent investors' pockets, rather than those of the primary wrongdoers, and the measure of damages fails to account for the windfall gains that many noncul- pable investors receive from the fraud. 58 See Arlen &amp; Carney, supra note 19, at 720 (arguing that holding the agent rather than the corporation liable for fraud on the market will provide a more just and effec- tive deterrent). 59 It seems clear that managers-boards of directors as well as insiders-would be sensitive to the risk of firm liability in making judgments about whether to lie in the interest of shareholders in merger, product development, and other "competitive" situations. Given the conflict of interest, however, Arlen and Carney are clearly right in seeing the need for agent liability as well. 60 Information flow is a major concern in Kenneth Arrow's analysis of organiza- tions. See KENNETHJ. ARROW, THE LIMITS OF ORGANIZATION 33-43, 33 (1974) (stating that "[t]he purpose of organizations is to exploit the fact that many (virtually all) deci- sions require the participation of many individuals for their effectiveness" and discuss- ing the costs of communication channels as influenced by activities of the individual rather than the collection of information). For a more conventional economics per- spective, emphasizing how informational asymmetry can be combatted in principal- agent relationships within the firm, see PAUL MILGROM &amp;JOHN ROBERTS, ECONOMICS, ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT 100-03 (1992), and WILLIAMSON, supra note 2. See also MERRITT B. Fox, FINANCE AND INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE IN A DYNAMIC ECONOMY 118 (1987) ("Ideas relating to the ... financial decisions of top management.... are likely to be processed as they make their way toward the top managers of a firm.").</page><page sequence="20">120 UNIVERSITY OFPENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 the most immediate access to useful information.6' Corporations must devise some kind of communications system that enables impor- tant data to move upward to the proper decisionmaker, without caus- ing all information of any arguable relevance to be moved to the desks of a sequence of busy supervisors. Corporate hierarchies serve this role,62 with varying systems of routines, norms, and philosophies to customize the information flow in any given firm. One common system is to teach managers to distinguish between the unusual and 63 the usual, and limit information flow to the former. The currently celebrated norm of "participatory management" is another way of ad- 64 dressing the problem. The difficulty, of course, is that if material information must pass through a number of relay points in a hierarchy, the message can change (and lose accuracy) in the process. One need not assume any systematic cognitive bias at all. As the children's game of telephone inevitably illustrates, the mere act of retransmission makes it increas- ingly probable that the final message will not be the same as the one first sent. But economists and others assume that moral-hazard prob- lems are severe here: Subordinate managers will be tempted to vary the message to conform to their self-interest.65 61 See, e.g., Jane E. Dutton et al., Reading the Wind: How Middle Managers Assess the Context for Selling Issues to Top Managers, 18 STRATEGIC MGMT.

The employees with the most immediate access to basic infor- mation are almost always line personnel with a range of operational duties, not just the role of informational monitor. Salespeople, for instance, have the best sense of customer attitudes. The combination of operational responsibilities and reporting duties creates an obvious conflict of interest. Compensation is often subjective and set by the immediate supervisory (though sales is one area where performance- based compensation through commissions and quota systems is commonplace). For that reason alone, the natural reporting tempta- tion is to transmit information in a way that minimizes the potential for blaming oneself for bad news, and to convey as much good news as possible to the extent that the information can be attributed to the source-consistent, of course, with a general desire to have a reputa- tion for credibility with one's superiors.67 A further complication comes from the organization of many managers into teams, with no clear assignment of reporting responsibility to a particular member and ready excuses for treating the handling of bad news as a team- mate's problem, rather than one's own. The highly situational incentive to distort is exacerbated by the promotion and termination structures commonly found in large cor- porations. Especially for junior managers on the executive track, there is a rapid rotation of responsibilities. Rarely does one stay in one role for more than two years, and tangible evidence of skill and loyalty must be demonstrated repeatedly to justify promotion and incomes" and that large firms develop bureaucratic structures that "tend to ... provide biased information to top management which reflects its own desires and ideas too strongly"). Jack Coffee has explored the information-flow problem as it relates to the potential for concealing corporate criminal activity. See Coffee, supra note 4, at 1131- 47 (noting that adverse information relating to contingent liabilities appears not to reach the board until a crisis of scandal has become unavoidable); see also STONE, supra note 4, at 201-09 (discussing the corporation's information net). On insider trading and information flow, see RobertJ. Haft, The Effect of Insider Trading Rules on the Internal Efficiency of the Large Corporation, 80 MICH. L. REV. 1051 (1982). 66 Noteworthy here, as recognized even in conventional economic analysis, is the tendency to report to the boss what one perceives the boss wants to hear. See Canice Prendergast, A Theory of "Yes Men", 83 AM. ECON. REV. 757, 769 (1993) ("If workers are rewarded on a subjective basis, they may distort their behavior toward what they feel their superiors want to hear."). 67 Obviously, bad news that will be discovered shortly anyway cannot be concealed without paying a price in terms of future credibility. But bad news comes in many dif- ferent guises; some may not be discovered for some time to come, and may be quite ambiguous in causal terms when it does. In these situations, impression management can have its desired effect.</page><page sequence="22">122 UNIVERSITY OFPENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 avoid termination or a career slowdown. This places special impor- tance on the need to accentuate the positive and to distort bad news, 68 and introduces a clear-cut long-term/short-term bias. To an ambi- tious manager facing a series of such "probationary crucibles,"69 ad- verse information that would taint his or her candidacy but will not be realized more broadly within the organization until that manager has either moved up or out-at a time when any attribution of personal responsibility is either impossible or unlikely because so many possi- ble causes intervene over time-should be concealed or distorted. As economists are quick to point out, none of this comes as a sur- prise,70 and thus efficiency-driven firms must try to counter the prob- lem. There are techniques to try to induce more accurate reporting. The prevailing system of accounting and auditing, for example, has, as one function, the creation of an internal financial-control system that is independent of the moral hazard of line-personnel reporting. Such systems, however, are expensive and workable only with respect to certain kinds of independently verifiable data (and are probably more subjective and subject to failure than we would like to think) .7 Other monitoring interventions are also possible, but again tend to 68 See Elizabeth A.

This is espe- cially true in organizations that are team-based, where the managers who have insti- tuted a poor policy are elsewhere when the impact is felt and there is no good mecha- nism for assigning blame retrospectively. ROBERTJACKALL, MORAL MAZES 40 (1988). Jackall's work is very interesting in this regard, emphasizing the complex relationship among promotion patterns, infor- mation flow, and moral judgments. His relatively pessimistic conclusion is that the interplay of these factors biases the corporate hierarchy toward those who are rela- tively plastic in their ethical thinking-good team players who know how to manage information and not threaten teammates and superiors in how they handle what they observe. See id. at 56 (describing the essential characteristics of the "team" player); see also Frederick B. Bird &amp; James A. Waters, The Moral Muteness of Managers, CAL. MGMT. REV., Fall 1989, at 73, 76 (noting that managers' interactions are influenced by their concerns that "moral talk will threaten organizational harmony, organizational effi- ciency, and their own reputation for power and effectiveness"). 70 For an overview, see Radner, supra note 62. 71 Indeed, even in accounting-where the monitoring structure is most formal- ized-the risk of "audit failures" for a variety of reasons (not simply because the mis- behavior was well concealed, but because of compromised independence, conflict of interest, and cognitive bias) is far from trivial.

Though these can be useful, they simply in- crease ambiguity if differing interpretations of the same subjects filter upward, and are no less subject to selfish manipulation. Thus, it is not surprising that most corporations opt for some variation of the traditional hierarchical structure, which depends on a mix of contractual incentives and cultural norms to induce appropri- ate behavior at each level. Each superior monitors both the opera- tion and the information-reporting performance of the subordinate manager, and adjusts compensation and promotion accordingly.73 There is likely to be much emphasis on "responsiveness" and endless team meetings and cultural displays about the need for accurate and timely information flow. But one cannot be overly optimistic about the outcome: The moral-hazard problem can be dampened through structure and contract but not eliminated. Consider the position of a manager who both supervises a team and reports to a series of higher- level managers. In seeking accurate information from subordinates, she must keep in mind that the information may not reflect well on her to the extent that it is subject to retransmission upward. Under these circumstances, the supervisor may communicate that there are certain things she wants to hear and certain things she does not.74 Indeed, she may well encourage subordinates to keep negative infor- mation from her in order to preserve the ability to deny responsibility should problems later be uncovered.75 This could be accomplished 72 See Carol M. Rose, Trust in the Mirror of Betrayal, 75 B.U. L. REv. 531, 540-41 (1995) ("[P]eople do not like to be monitored. They may well mistake monitoring and questioning for distrust ...."); Sim B.

Tyler eds., 1996) ("[H]ighly formalized management control systems can lead to escalating distrust...."). The point made in this literature is that monitoring is a signal of distrust, which both affects the subordinates' level of com- mitment, and shifts time and attention to managing the impressions of the monitor rather than doing "real work." 73 Indeed, if the monitors observe operational success (for example, profitability), the chance of disciplining a manager based on faulty information reporting may be minimal. 74 See Prendergast, supra note 66, at 757 (illustrating incentives for workers to con- form to the opinions of their superiors). 75 See, e.g., Larry D.

Even if a senior manager made a credible statement that she wanted accurate information reporting (and was prepared to enforce the rule through sanctions), it is unlikely that this would necessarily trigger conforming behavior below. The problem of termination and compensation remains in an environment of informational asymme- try where monitoring reporting accuracy is often impossible. In other words, we have a large-scale replication of Arlen and Carney's last- period problem77 in each nested layer of the hierarchy. To the extent that any given employee fears the possibility of being fired or dead- ended in light of a candid portrayal of the situation (a constant in fast-track managerial pyramids), distortion or concealment becomes a dominant strategy regardless of long-term promises, threats, or repu- tational incentives.78 (discussing the building of a wall around President Reagan by subordinates so he could plausibly deny liability); Jack Katz, Concerted Ignorance: The Social Construction of Cover-Up, 8 URB. LIFE 295, 298-305 (1979) (discussing how cover-ups are established and maintained in large scale organizations through "concerted ignorance" by superi- ors and subordinates). 76 Here we once again encounter a particular problem with respect to information that is either ambiguous or incomplete (the latter being commonplace when there is substantial diffusion of responsibility within the firm). The employee does not know for sure whether it is serious, and runs the risk of considerable blame if she raises it and it turns out to be groundless. In that situation, employees may choose to withhold key pieces of information that, if made available to the higher-ups, could be pieced together and dealt with. 77 See supra notes 40-44 and accompanying text. 78 Cf. Keith C. Brown et al., Of Tournaments and Temptations: An Analysis of Manage- rial Incentives in the Mutual Fund Industry, 51 J. FIN. 85, 90-93 (1996) (offering evidence of comparable short-term opportunism notwithstanding reputational incentives). We need not assume that these distortions are in bad faith. One of the most noted theo- rists in this area, Chris Argyris, argues that the desire to avoid unpleasant confronta- tion and maintain positive relationships in organizations ultimately leads to organiza- tional defensiveness: Leaders communicate (implicitly) that certain matters are undiscussable," and information flow thereby becomes skewed as communication both up and down the organization chart avoids treating these issues. Problems there- fore disappear from managerial awareness until crisis, and effective corporate learning is frustrated.

BEHAV. &amp; ORG. 251 (1994).</page><page sequence="25">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 125 The image that we are left with, then, is that the forward-looking information package that arrives at the top of the hierarchy after be- ing filtered through multiple layers-the mosaic of data and infer- ence from which forward-looking corporate disclosures must be drawn-is likely to be more uncertain in its accuracy than might at pear at first glance. Positive information will move more quickly to the top, with the primary problem in assessing it being the possibility of overstatement, and excessive and conflicting claims of credit. Negative information will travel more slowly, if at all, and will be more subject to skewing. On average, a natural optimistic bias results. And the problem of distortion becomes most severe in companies that face substantial adverse shocks to their environments.79 We should therefore be sympathetic to the plight of the senior executive charged with disclosure responsibilities. There is evidence in the literature that senior executives do habitually discount the ve- racity of information that moves upward, especially when it has a posi- tive spin. But that discount is rough and imprecise, and thus of little aid in achieving disclosure accuracy. Forward-looking disclosure or disclosure of facts, the import of which are largely predictive, must of- ten be made with less-than-complete confidence of their accuracy, with the nagging sense that with more time, doubts about data quality might naturally diminish. From time to time, senior executives will discover, much too late, that the truth is indeed quite different from what they have been led to believe. To be sure, senior executives cannot explicitly acknowledge this. Part of the essential dramaturgi- cal role of senior managers is to communicate confidence and con- trol over their environment, and as we have seen, many management theorists believe that effective corporate disclosure must reflect a comparable level of confidence in control, if not performance, by the senior management group.81 Thus, even putting aside the possibility that those top managers have their own selfish reasons to distort, there is a substantial risk of a mismatch between what they say and 79 According to the organizational-decline literature, see supra note 50, one com- mon tendency in firms under financial stress is the centralization of authority at the top, thereby narrowing of lines of communication. See Sutton, supra note 50, at 223-26 (describing "rigidity" effects of danger). Sensing a last period, employees may then abet this tendency by either withdrawing or engaging in extremely self-protective communications. 80 See Haft, supra note 65, at 1053-54 ("Superiors may reduce distortion by counter- biasing or discounting the content of the message by the self-interest that they per- ceive the sender to have in the message."), and sources cited therein. 81 See sup/a notes 49-50 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="26">126 UNIVERSITY OFPENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 what, once a retrospective look at what all those in the organization actually knew or sensed is undertaken, was "known" by others in the firm. B. Some Legal Implications There are some interesting implications for corporate and securi- ties law simply from recognizing the dynamics of information flow. The dominating question is whether a company can be held liable for a violation of Rule 10b-5 upon a showing that even though the indi- vidual managers who formulated the disclosure were not aware of in- formation that would cause them to doubt its accuracy, such informa- tion was possessed by others in the company (who may or may not have 82 5hsasine known that disclosure was being made). Rule 10b5 has a scienter requirement, which in the eyes of most courts can be satisfied by a showing of either knowledge or recklessness on the defendant's part.83 82 Arguably, it is something of an open question as to whether companies can be held liable at all under Rule 10b-5 as primary violators (as opposed to controlling per- sons under section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. ? 78t(a) (1994)). By most accounts, they can, if by nothing else than reference to the definition of "person" in section 3(a) (9) of the Act, which refers specifically to juristic persons. See id. ? 78c(a) (9) ("The term 'person' means a ... company ...."). Since corporations almost by necessity speak through agents, the natural construction of section 10(b), id. ? 78j(b), and section 3(a) (9), id. ? 78c(a) (9), read together, makes it possible for cor- porations and other business entities to violate the antifraud provision directly. See SEC v. Management Dynamics, Inc., 515 F.2d 801, 812 (2d Cir. 1975) ("Congress evi- dently intended that a corporation might be liable in some instances as a 'person'; and this can only be by virtue of agency principles, since a corporation can act only through its agents."). For this reason, we shall assume that corporations can be pri- mary violators even though they speak through their agents, notwithstanding the sug- gestion in Central Bank v. First Interstate Bank that section 10(b) does not prohibit sec- ondary forms of liability. See 511 U.S. 164, 184 (1994) ("The fact that Congress chose to impose some forms of secondary liability, but not others, indicates a deliberate con- gressional choice with which the courts should not interfere."); Donald C. Langevoort, Words from on High About Rule 10b-5: Chiarella 's History, Central Bank's Future, 20 DEL. J. CORP. L. 865, 893-96 (1995) (reformulating fraud cases formerly understood as is- sues of respondeat superior liability into terms of direct-entity liability). 83 See Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 201 (1976) ("? 10(b) was ad- dressed to practices that involve some elements of scienter and cannot be read to im- pose liability for negligent conduct alone."); Cox ET AL., supra note 11, at 697-709 (commenting that Hochfelderonly rejected negligence from sufficing for liability under Rule 10b-5 without further defining scienter). The prevailing approach today is to treat recklessness as a subjective standard: There must be some awareness of the risk that the disclosure is false or misleading, not simply an extreme departure from the standard of care. See, e.g., Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., 554 F.2d 790, 793 (7th Cir. 1977) ("We believe 'reckless' in these circumstances comes closer to being a lesser</page><page sequence="27">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 127 It is easy enough doctrinally to make the affirmative case, simply by invoking basic agency-law principles that attribute all information acquired by any company employee acting in the scope of her author- ity to the company itself.84 Agency law contains a "corruption" excep- tion for situations where the employee is acting in a purely self- serving fashion, but this would not apply to the normal kinds of busi- ness-related information we have been discussing.85 Outside of the securities laws, a number of criminal and civil cases have concluded that one need not identify any individual manager who is culpable in order to have firm culpability under a "knowledge" standard: Aggre- gation of knowledge is an acceptable basis for liability.86 No cases, however, explicitly recognize such a theory under Rule 10b-5, and many cases, indirectly at least, seem to assume the contrary-that li- ability follows only if the human beings responsible for the disclosure 87 were aware of the falsity or recklessly disregarded the truth. form of intent than merely a greater degree of ordinary negligence. We perceive it to be notjust a difference in degree, but also in kind."). See, e.g., RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY ? 272 (1958) (mandating general attribution of knowledge). For one of the few academic discussions of this issue, see Craig L. Griffin, Corporate Scienter Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 1989 BYU L. REv. 1227. See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY ? 282 (1958) (providing that knowledge of the agent is not attributed to the principal if the agent is acting adversely to the principal when the agent obtains or uses the knowledge). 86 See, e.g., Nordstrom, Inc. v. Chubb &amp; Son, Inc., 54 F.3d 1424, 1434 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding that a good-faith defense in a fraud case is only available where the di- rectors did not induce the acts constituting the violation); Bank of New England v. United States, 821 F.2d 844, 850 (1st Cir. 1987) ("A collective knowledge instruction is entirely appropriate in the context of corporate criminal activity."); C.I.T. Corp. v. United States, 150 F.2d 85, 94 (9th Cir. 1945) ("In order that concealment of the property of a bankrupt may be ... a crime, it must be 'knowingly and fraudulently' concealed ...."). This is not the case, however, if the standard is based on willfulness. See SABA v. Compagnie Nationale Air France, 78 F.3d 664, 668 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (finding that lack of judgment and common sense by employees does not constitute willful misconduct). For a recent argument that this line of authority is both mis- guided and based on a misreading of the seminal case law, see Thomas A. Hageman &amp; Joseph Grinstein, The Mythology of Aggregate Corporate Knowledge: A Deconstruction, 65 GEO. WASH. L. REv. 210 (1997). 87 See, e.g., First Equity Corp. v. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., 690 F. Supp. 256, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) ("A corporation can be held to have a particular state of mind only when that state of mind is possessed by a single individual."). Most cases that deal with scienter do so on preliminary motions to dismiss for failure to plead facts giving rise to a sufficient inference of scienter. Here, a court may well choose to allow the knowl- edge of subordinates to suffice even if the court believes that a showing of knowledge by the person responsible for the disclosure would be required at trial before liability could be imposed. For a case allowing a complaint to stand on such grounds, al- though hinting that a showing that the high-level officials were not actually aware of</page><page sequence="28">128 UNIVERSITY OFPENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 The possibility that information-flow distortion can produce inac- curate disclosures by high-level officials helps illuminate this policy issue. To the extent that either the compensatory goal of making in- vestors-who somehow have relied on misinformation-whole, or the deterrence goal of preventing misinformation from affecting the market, is compelling, then a rule requiring that the speaker act with scienter would be counterproductive. Even if the compensatory goal in fraud-on-the-market cases is questionable,88 the deterrence goal is undeniably crucial to the ultimate goal of producing accurate stock 89 prices. One can also assume that were this rule well understood within firms, the tendency to withhold deliberately damaging infor- mation from superiors as a way of protecting both themselves and the firm would be stronger.90 Superiors would have one more reason to prefer the "plausible deniability" that comes from avoiding full in- formation.9' That is hardly a desirable outcome. At the same time, of course, one should also be aware of the costs associated with the aggregation rule, costs all ultimately borne by the firm's shareholders. De facto, this means that senior executives can- not prevent corporate liability simply by behaving honestly as a group, but instead must implement the best available internal information- control devices to manage the liability risk. However, such protection will only be partial; breakdowns are inevitable in the best of systems. In essence, then, Rule 10b-5 would operate for firms in something more akin to a negligence standard in terms of the precaution costs it generates. Some law-and-economics scholars have treated this scien- ter-based liability as if it generates no such costs.92 That treatment is the problem would preclude issuer liability at trial, see Steiner v. Unitrode Corp., 834 F. Supp. 40, 45 (D. Mass. 1993). 88 See supra note 57 and accompanying text. 89 See Marcel Kahan, Securities Law and the Social Costs of Inaccurate Stock Prices, 41 Duke L.J. 977, 1028 (1992) (discussing the various ways in which stock-price inaccura- cies detrimentally affect the market and management's behavior). 90 See Coffee, supra note 4, at 1119 (discussing the rationale of and the solutions to "defensive" corporate misbehavior). 91 See supra note 75 and accompanying text. In this regard, Jennifer Arlen has noted that too easy an attributional form of corporate criminal liability can lead cor- porations to underinvest in monitoring and detection mechanisms. SeeJennifer Arlen, The Potentially Perverse Effects of Corporate Criminal Liability, 23J. LEGAL STUD. 833, 843 (1994) (discussing the effects that different schemes of imposing criminal corporate liability will have on corporate enforcement expenditures). Of course, this would not necessarily deter firms from monitoring in order to detect misconduct that was about to occur or still in the process of occurring. 92 Cf., e.g., EAsTERBROOK &amp; FISCHEL, supra note 1, at 339-44 (arguing that the scien- ter requirement encourages more accurate enforcement, but also acknowledging that</page><page sequence="29">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 129 probably inaccurate, given the fuzziness of securities-law responsibili- ties and the palpable risk of judicial error.93 An aggregation rule makes all the more clear what has been expressed in Part I-that Rule lOb-5 generates a surprisingly large number of hidden costs that must be added to the calculus when assessing desirable policy.94 To the extent that the law continues its apparent preference for requiring actor-level scienter, however, another message becomes clear: Recklessness has a particularly important practical role to play in the application of Rule lOb-5. Recall once again the likely sense that senior executives have when dealing with fast-moving corporate events for which they lack primary access to information. They will receive information, perhaps from multiple, and thus conflicting, sources that may well have become distorted in transmission. In other words, senior executives have some basis for disclosure, but may be less than fully confident of its accuracy. A public statement that relies on this internal information but fails to convey the bases for doubt or the conflicting information available to the speaker may not be a knowing form of deception-in some ways, it is the speaker's best estimate of the situation as presented from within the organiza- tion.95 However, one can readily imagine particular cases in which enough conscious doubt has been suppressed that the resulting dis- closure is culpably misleading, and recklessness would provide the clearest way of characterizing the underlying state of mind.96 The agency-cost information-distortion phenomenon may also help explain some well-known judicial decisions in securities law. As if section 10(b) does generate precaution costs, their own analysis would have to change). 93 See Mahoney, supra note 57, at 625 ("[T]he problem of applying fraud doctrine to impersonal markets extends beyond securities law, and taken to its extreme, [the fraud-on-the-market theory] could swallow up a considerable amount of the common law of fraud."). Because scienter can be proven circumstantially, it is always possible that the corporate executive's disregard of red flags, considered in hindsight, will be treated by the courts as recklessness, when, in reality, it might have been, at most, neg- ligence. 9 See supra notes 56-57 and accompanying text. 95 Here, on the assumption regarding actor intent-based liability, there would be no cause for imposing liability. On the other hand, if the law were to choose a broad attribution rule, this would not be an issue: The corporation would be liable simply via the attribution of knowledge from other employees. 96 Consistent with the subjective test for recklessness, this is the situation in which the executive is consciously unsure of the accuracy of his statements, but speaks confi- dently nonetheless.

Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.97 There, Texas Gulf Sulphur ("TGS") was in possession of core drilling samples that suggested that certain property in Ontario might contain extremely valuable mineral deposits; yet a TGS press release dampened the investor enthusiasm that had developed as rumors leaked out about the possible find.98 Thus, this case is one of the less common "good news" concealment cases under Rule 10b-5. One of the fascinating questions that re- mains is why TGS would have taken the actions that it did. A com- mon response is that the company was seeking to buy up more land and wanted to keep potential sellers unaware of the value of their property, but this seems questionable. The rumors were already cir- culating, and the press release hardly denied the find." Few of the owners of land coveted by TGS would be fooled into selling their land at less than full value in this setting. There is an intriguing alternative explanation: To the extent that top company officials had some rea- son, based on past experience, to be skeptical of the internal optimis- tic reports, a natural and good-faith response would be one that lay- ered the disclosure with an abundance of caution in order to reduce litigation exposure should the actual results turn out to be disap- pointing. The TGS press release, in other words, might simply have been the product of managers who, like many of their peers, have doubts about the heralds of good news that commonly percolate up from the operating divisions, and habitually apply a discount to these messages.

In many ways, these differences boil down to an emphasis on organizational culture that is distinct from the immediate performance demands of the profit-seeking enter- prise. Culture-the norms, routines, and shared understandings and 102 expectations of those who participate in the firm's activities -is cen- tral because performance demands are often highly ambiguous once basic success has been achieved and the set of routines supporting the firm's basic technology is in place. In the face of external ambiguity with respect to further strategic decisionmaking,103 organizations may turn inward to find explanations for action and the pursuit of legiti- macy. Some of this inwardness has a perfectly rational agency-cost ex- planation.'04 Basic technological success creates vested political inter- ests within the firm that are upset by strategic or technological change. As in all aspects of society, process and routine are inher- ently conservative. As March and Simon suggest, however, culture also has a strong cognitive dimension that does not simply reflect the self-interests of individual power bases. A basic premise in work on organizational behavior is that institutions develop belief systems- shared ways of interpreting themselves, their environments, their pasts, and their prospects. These belief systems are functionally im- portant because they facilitate interaction and communication be- tween managers and employees, simplifying the task of coordinating ACAD. MGMT.

Jeffrey Pfeffer, for example, writes that management is essen- tially the art of providing "explanations, rationalizations, and legiti- mation for the activities undertaken in the organization."'107 Similarly, Karl Weick and Richard Daft contend that "the job of management is to interpret, not to get the work of the organization done."' 08 This is not to say that all employees become true believers in all that man- agement says or that corporate norms suggest. Consciously, some employees will often complain or criticize the corporate belief system. But few doubt that, on average (and even with respect to some of the apparent cynics), these belief systems are powerful normative influ- ences once a coherent culture evolves. We need not treat even this as a wholly noneconomic construct, of course. Economists have increasingly become interested in cul- tures as reputational mechanisms for generating trust within organi- zations and making the firm's external commitments more credi- 105 See MARTHA S. FELDMAN, ORDER WITHOUT DESIGN 136-37 (1989) (discussing the ability of routines "to organize work and produce results despite the fact that the par- ticipants ... do not appear to value ... the outcomes"). This is an extremely impor- tant point. Imagine two people who must work out a commercial relationship. The first task is to come to some common understanding of the existing situation, and then move on to understand the means necessary to carry out their mutual objective. That is often a difficult and time-consuming task. Add a third person, and so on, and the task becomes exponentially more complex. In a large organization, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of key stakeholders. If each transaction within the firm must be preceded by this process of mutual orientation and agreement, the ability to conduct intrafirm business will be slowed considerably. To the extent that a shared culture provides stock understandings, these same transactions will be facilitated, and with them, firm efficiency.

Cultures can have strong elements of myth in them; they do not depend on (and may find counterproductive) too strong a dose of reality. Myths reduce the fear and stress that uncertainty of- ten generates. Consequently, there are strong arguments within the literature on organizational cognition that predictable biases operate within corporate belief systems in a way that cause managers to misper- ceive events and risks, allowing them in good faith to perpetuate an unrealistic belief system in the face of external stress.110 If so, we have another plausible explanation for deceptive corporate disclosure, with interesting legal implications. Disclosure will reflect not what an objective observer would see, but what someone embedded in the corporate culture would perceive. To be sure, there are no fixed behavioral rules that inevitably blind corporate managers-the standard claim here is that there is a loose coupling between beliefs and productivity, not a complete sepa- ration."'

Not surprisingly, psycho- logically oriented researchers and conventional economists debate over the ability of "cognitive defects" to persist, especially in competitive markets and among expert de- cisionmakers.

Even in the face of ambiguity, some managers, under some circumstances, will see risks more clearly, and some companies will do better than others at "debiasing." Bias is highly contextual, and I do not want to overstate the incidence of distortion in corporate perception. My claim is simply this: These biases are sufficiently well-accepted in both the theoretical and empirical litera- ture that we should take them seriously as behavioral risks, even if we cannot determine their exact role in any given setting"2 or estimate how often they will apply in general. Four such biases, discussed be- low, are worth particular attention."3 economic models). One is the counterintuitive but persuasive conclusion that many of these biases may be adaptive and efficient on average-something that helps ex- plain their persistence even among experts. See Colin F. Camerer &amp; Eric J. Johnson, The Process-Pformance Paradox in Expert Judgment: How Can Experts Know So Much and Predict So Badly?, in TOWARD A GENERAL THEORY OF EXPERTISE 195, 210 (K Anders Er- icsson &amp; Jacqui Smith eds., 1991) (noting that experts, in the face of contradictory evidence, tend to revise rather than abandon their configurational rules). The other is ample evidence that people and organizations do not learn from experience as well as the rational-actor model would predict. For people to learn from their mistakes, feedback must be both immediate and unambiguous-conditions that rarely apply in business settings. Hence, biases and illusions can persist. See, e.g., Ed Bukszar &amp; Terry Connolly, Hindsight Bias and Strategic Choice: Some Problems in Learning from Experience, 31 ACAD. MGMT.J. 628, 630 (1988) (suggesting that hindsight distorts a manager's un- derstanding of past decisions); Jack Feldman, On the Difficulty of Learning from Expenr- ence, in THE THINKING ORGANIZATION, supra note 20, at 263, 271-79 (outlining factors that produce errors in learning from experience). 112 There is a strong and justified concern that psychological explanations can be invoked too easily to explain "fiascos" in hindsight. The factual complexity of such settings makes empirical verification impossible. See, e.g., MARK BOVENS &amp; PAUL 'T HART, UNDERSTANDING POLICY FIAscos 8-9 (1996) ("People tend to underestimate sys- tematically the complexity of issues, the inconclusiveness of information and the gen- eral uncertainty which is caused by strategic interaction ...."); Baruch Fischhoff &amp; Ruth Beyth-Marom, Failure Has Many Fathers, 7 POL'Y Sci. 388, 391 (1978) (reviewing IRVING JANIS, VICTIMS OF GROUPTHINK (1972)) ("[P]eople consistently overestimate the predictability of past events once they know how they turned out."). 113 The social-cognition literature tends to distinguish between two types of biases. Some are purely cognitive ("cold"). They exist simply to manage complexity and make action possible in a world of bounded rationality. See Philip E. Tetlock &amp; Ariel Levi, Attribution Bias: On the Inconclusiveness of the Cognition-Motivation Debate, 18J. EX- PERIMENTAL SOC. PSYCHOL. 68, 70-74 (1982) (discussing the cognitive approach). Others are motivated ("hot"). These biases exist because they serve some adaptive function not grounded in rationality, and thus are the more likely source of mythic beliefs. See id. at 75-82 (discussing the motivational theories). In many cases, it is diffi- cult to arrive at a single explanation. See id. at 84.

Cognitive Conservatism and Decision Simplification A well-documented tendency of people who must operate in noisy informational environments is to adopt heuristic forms of thought. Busy executives process extraordinarily large amounts of information in both making decisions and deciding what matters deserve further time and attention. Such processing must necessarily be simplified, sometimes oversimplified, to make the information manageable, lest the executive be overwhelmed by data and paralyzed by ambiguity.14 Commonly, people build schemas to provide them with "best available" interpretations. These include stock understandings of people and situations. When given enough motivation, people will revise their schemas to reflect new information. But processing limits lead to a bias against revision: The normal cognitive strategy is to construe information and events in such a way as to confirm prior at- titudes, beliefs, and impressions."5 Like all biases, this "cognitive con- servatism" occurs unconsciously.1 114 See Sara Kiesler &amp; Lee Sproull, Managerial Responses to Changing Environments: Perspectives on Problem Sensingfrom Social Cognition, 27 ADMIN.

One of the remarkable developments in economics dur- ing the last decade or so has been the growing recognition of the costs associated with cognitive attention, and, accordingly, the need to develop models of decisionmaking that recognize the tradeoffs that must be made. See, e.g., JOHN W. PAYNE ET AL., THE ADAPTIVE DECISION MAKER 70-116, 114 (1993) ("[S]trategy selection is the result of a compromise between the desire to make the most accurate decision and the desire to minimize effort.").

Successful companies naturally produce positive schemas: previous challenges overcome, financing obtained, and products successfully brought to market. A new product is begun in an environment where the decisionmakers agree that there is a sound basis for its develop- ment. That becomes the schema (or "script"), and potentially trou- bling bits of information are subject to dismissal or rationalization, without much conscious deliberation, if they can be processed consis- tently with the original belief."" The tendency to ignore evidence of change in one's environment is likely to be especially strong when, as they usually do, the bits of information come sequentially in small doses rather than aggregated in some salient event. While we can explain cognitive conservatism simply in terms of bounded rationality, it also has the motivational role of reducing stress. Revising a schema is anxiety-provoking, especially if it opens up a host of troubling possibilities. Subconsciously, busy executives do not want to be bothered with disconfirming information, and so will seek to minimize the threat. Like most everyone (except the neurotic, who do not thrive in business settings), they will tend to ig- nore risks that appear to have little probability of occurring.119 Again, 117 See supra notes 60-63 and accompanying text. 118 A fascinating account of the influence of script-based cognitive conservatism on Ford's Pinto experience-written by a psychologist who, prior to becoming an aca- demic, was one of Ford's recall managers-is given in Dennis A.

Gillette, Commercial Relationships and the</page><page sequence="37">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 137 the preferred course is dismissal or explanation in conformity with the existing schema; it takes a fairly vivid or salient threat to prompt revision.'20 In general, then, we can predict that most managers will systematically underestimate external threats to success. These tendencies are strengthened when managers work in teams or share decisionmaking responsibility. Because of the demands of communication and negotiation, groups can attend to even less in- formation than individuals, leading to a tendency to simplify agendas in order to make decisions tractable.'2' This is frequently done by fo- cusing the group's attention only on immediate, first-level effects, putting out of mind the more complicated and unpredictable- though potentially important-second-level and systematic conse- quences. Ambiguous information tends to be dismissed as unman- ageable: 22 There is an excessively high test of materiality. In an in- triguing article on ethical decisionmaking, David Messick and Max Bazerman note both the tendency of many managers to be intolerant of uncertain data-for example, the "tough-minded executive," who, in evaluating potential hiring discrimination, will accept only specific instances of demonstrable bias, not statistics and probabilities-as well as a tendency toward circumscribed information searches in reaching decisions, thereby forcing an underestimation of the impact Selection of Default Rules for Remote Risks, 19 J.

Groups, for instance, are good at filtering out nonsystematic kinds of errors to which a particular member might be inclined. The point is simply that group dynamics can intensify the influence of motivations that are shared among group members.</page><page sequence="38">138 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 on secondary stakeholders and a failure to appreciate the risk that strategic forms of "cheating" will be detected.'23 Here, we see how risks that might meet the lawyer's test for materiality in a disclosure environment would be given less weight, and less attention, in the primary business setting. Groups are also motivated to preserve cohesiveness (and the effi- cacy of their decisionmaking norms and procedures), and this too can sometimes result in the underestimation of risk. When a member brings up some information that suggests that the group's decision- making has failed to consider something troubling, a threatening form of stress is introduced into the environment. Without realizing it, each member is inclined to dismiss or ignore danger signals, lead- ing to less informed decisionmaking that more closely resembles col- lective rationalization than prudent choice.'24 Moreover, even if a group member privately wonders whether some bit of information is troubling, the very fact that other group members do not appear to be concerned is a reason to let the matter drop, a process of social learning that has a dangerous circularity to it.'25 This is especially powerful when there is a diffusion of responsibility among group members such that none feels compelled to lead and each can justify silence.126 The term given to the group-cohesion phenomenon by IrvingJanis is "groupthink," and it is commonly used as an explana- tion for myopic corporate and political behavior.'27 A group of senior 123 David H.

Overoptimism and the Illusion of Control We now move more squarely into the motivational sphere. One of the most robust findings in the literature on individual decision- making is that of the systematic tendency of many people to overrate their own abilities, contributions, and talents. This egocentric bias readily takes the form of excessive optimism and overconfidence, coupled with an inflated sense of ability to control events and risks. 28 In explaining good and bad fortune, people are asymmetric: Positive events are the product of their skill, negative ones of external circum- stances. Furthermore, people filter self-referential information with the same asymmetry to bolster or maintain self-esteem.'29 As with the biases discussed in the previous subsection, these are largely uncon- scious ones.130 While some outward expressions of optimism and con- fidence are deliberate forms of impression management, psycholo- gists believe that most often the person truly accepts the excessively positive self-schema. Self-deception is necessary to sustain the illusion effectively, diminishing the anxiety produced by too much self- doubt. 131 (describing "groupthink" as a "collective pattern of avoidance"). Tests of groupthink offer considerable support for the phenomenon as a potential behavioral explanation; however, one must be cautious not to universalize it. See Philip E. Tetlock et al., Assess- ing Political Group Dynamics: A Test of the Groupthink Model, 63 J. PERSONALITrY &amp; SOC. PSYCHOL. 403, 403 (1992) (explaining the validity of the groupthink model). 128 See MAX H. BAZERMAN, JUDGMENT IN MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING 37-39 (3d ed. 1994) (discussing overconfidence among managers). For instance, a sample of people who indicated near total certainty (1000-to-1 odds) that their judgments were right were in fact right only about 81% to 88% of the time.

Optimists are prized in the hiring process. For example, one of the leading re- search psychologists in this area, Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania, has designed hiring tests to assess high levels of opti- mism for numerous corporations, including Metropolitan Life's sales force.133 And, as noted in Part II, there is good reason to believe that the tournament-like competition for promotion up the executive lad- der overweights optimism and its associated behavioral traits, inflating such behavior toward the top of the hierarchy.134 This is especially so in industries, like many service ones, where a sales and marketing cul- ture dominates. For obvious reasons, the prevalence of illusory control in many businesses can become systematic, infecting the company's overarch- ing belief system. Numerous studies offer evidence of it. Edward Zajac and Max Bazerman, for example, contend that these cognitive biases are the primary explanation for a host of suboptimal strategic decisions of the type chronically observed in industry: overbidding for assets, plant overexpansion, and foolish entry into new lines of business.135 As much as anything, they say, systematic overcommit- ment derives from the inculcated and persistent belief-one that tends not to be eroded by learning and experience -that one's own company is superior to its competitors, leading to an underestimation of the competitors' likely responses to a strategic move.137 This expla- atically distort their views of self and world, ... deriv[ing] important benefits from do- ing so" and suggesting that "there is an optimal margin of illusion at which people are happiest, function best, and so forth"). 132 See Chip Heath &amp; Forest J.

Faced with some evidence that a product under development is failing and market share is eroding, managers in many companies will honestly believe that these are minor challenges that can readily be overcome. They will draw on inflated schemas of past successes and underrate their competitors' ability to capitalize.140 Furthermore, a "can-do" culture built on these adaptive biases will prize the dismissal of risk and reject any effort to accept and acknowl- edge their seriousness publicly. As we saw previously, belief systems are powerful and need nurturing.14 Moreover, disconfirming infor- mation is stress-inducing, and the need to protect the management group's cohesion will result in the dismissal or rationalization of prob- lems if there is a plausible basis for so doing. Such belief systems may not easily tolerate forms of publicity or disclosure that are at odds with the corporate self-image. 13 See BAZERMAN, supra note 128, at 166-69 (discussing the "winner's curse" in competitive bidding). 139 See Bernard S.

Commitment Commitment is one of the foundational concepts of both indi- vidual and organizational psychology.142 Once a person voluntarily commits to an idea or course of action, there is a strong motivation to resist evidence that it was ill-chosen. Self-confidence and external image are threatened both by introducing a troubling awareness of the possibility of mistake and by raising the need to consider a rever- sal of one's position, which, in turn, calls into question one's reputa- tion for consistency, a highly valued asset in our economic culture. 43 Cognitive-dissonance theory predicts that once a commitment is made, attitudes and beliefs will shift to preserve consistency. 44 Sales people and negotiators know well that once a person takes a few steps toward some purchase or deal, the likelihood of agreement in- 145 creases. The management literature strongly suggests that once executives have committed to a course of action, their subsequent survey of in- formation is strongly biased to bolster their choice-especially when their choice is public, and they can be held accountable for their de- 142 See D.

ORG. BEHAV. 415, 416-18 (1997) (tying commitment to self-efficacy and overconfidence). Of course, one cannot be sure that commitment is necessarily a bias; a rational actor might remain committed to a course of action if she fears that discovery of the mistake will lead to termination.

Although we can see a possi- ble rational basis here grounded in the last-period problem, the weight of authority supports the position that managers come to be- lieve in the efficacy of projects for which they are responsible, objec- tive evidence often notwithstanding. Hence, the phenomenon of "throwing good money after bad." Various scholars have identified the commitment bias as a primary cause of the chronic overcapacity often observed in industiy.'47 4. Self-Serving Beliefs Both the optimistic and commitment biases raise a troubling con- cern. Beliefs that lead to throwing good money after bad in an effort to avoid acknowledging a mistake to one's self or to the public seem to be fairly selfish forms of inference.'48 This presents the possibility that certain forms of managerial beliefs may not necessarily be molded in the company's best interests-though that may be the 146 Postdecisional bolstering takes place in settings of accountability, even though accountability otherwise tends to improve decision quality.

I have suggested that this commitment bias may prevent lawyers from fully appreciating the risk of client wrongdoing, making them less than fully competent gatekeepers. See Donald C. Langevoort, Where Were the Lawyers?: A Behavioral Inquiry into Lawyer Responsibility for Clients' Fraud, 46 VAND. L. REV. 75, 111 (1993) ("[T]here are reasons. . . to doubt that lawyers will be very good gatekeepers once they have committed to representation and built a positive schema regarding the client and the situation."). 147 See Zajac &amp; Bazerman, supra note 135, at 45, 47 (noting that firms may irration- ally escalate commitment to expand capacity). On overcapacity generally, see MICHAEL E. PORTER, COMPETITIVE STRATEGY 328 (1980). An interesting account of the escalation of commitment to a course of action as applied to an example of mana- gerial wrongdoing-the dilution of apple juice by Beech-Nut executives-can be found in PHILIP G. ZIMBARDO &amp; MICHAEL R. LIEPPE, THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ATrITUDE CHANGE AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE 120-21 (1991).

MGMT.J. 701 (1993). 148 Not so, of course, if this commitment bias simply reflects cognitive conservatism and inflated self-efficacy, especially if derived from the organization's own biases. The point here is that disentangling self-serving and business-oriented biases may not be so easy. See Andrew D. Brown, Narcissism, Identity and Legitimacy, 22 ACAD. MGMT.

The notion of self-serving inference is another fundamental con- struct in social cognition.'49 When there is enough ambiguity to per- mit it, people naturally "see what they want to see."'50 And what they want to see is something that is in their self-interest, not a threat to either their self-esteem or career prospects. That threat is stressful, and, to a small group, upsets cohesion. 5 It is, therefore, resisted. This is not to say that management control groups live in settings of blissful ignorance. Much information is too unambiguous to deflect: Corporations do have regular feedback in the form of sales data, cash flow, and the like. Self-serving inference is an anxiety buffer, not an anxiety eliminator. Management groups may subconsciously perceive information in a way, if at all possible, that permits them to maintain consistency with their self-image of efficacy and control, thereby justi- fying (to themselves and others) preservation of their positions and status. They will be adept at the self-deception that leads them to per- suasively articulate the corporate interest in full consistency with their personal goals. 1 See, e.g., Dennis A. Gioia, Self-Serving Bias as a Self-Sensemaking Strategy: Explicit vs. Tacit Impression Management, in IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT IN THE ORGANIZATION 219, 230-33 (Robert A. Giacalone &amp; Paul Rosenfeld eds., 1989) (concluding that the objec- tive of dealing with self-serving bias should be to manage it, not squelch it); George Loewenstein, Behavioral Decision Theory and Business Ethics: Skewed Trade-offs Between Self and Other, in CODES OF CONDUCT 214, 221 (David M. Messick &amp; Ann E. Tenbreusel eds., 1996) (noting that "[o]ne of the most important nonobjective influences on in- formation processing is self-interest"). The most common manifestation is the ten- dency to construe what is right or fair in a self-serving direction. See George Loewen- stein et al., Self-Serving Assessments of Fairness and Pretrial Bargaining, 22 J. LEGAL STUD. 135, 139 (1993) ("[P]redictions of the value of the claim and judgments of what set- tlement would be fair are both biased in a self-serving manner. Moreover, the magni- tude of the bias is a strong predictor of nonsettlement."). 150 See THOMAS GILOVICH, How WE KNOW WHAT ISN'T So 75-87, 76 (1991) (discussing the "tendency for people to believe ... what they want to believe"). This is a classic form of motivated reasoning. See, e.g., Peter H. Ditto &amp; David F. Lopez, Moti- vated Skepticism: Use of Differential Decision Criteria for Preferred and Nonpreferred Conclu- sions, 63J. PERSONALITY&amp; SOC.

On the other hand, optimism has a dark side, justifying the preservation of the status quo, and hence can also serve as an entrenchment mecha- nism.152 If the future is rosy, senior managers deserve not only to keep their jobs, but also to receive additional perquisites. This sug- gests that highly optimistic forms of belief may well strengthen in the face of increasingly disconfirming information as fed by the strong personal needs of the senior managers. In all likelihood, one way that we can measure the self-serving tendencies of top management is to examine how well they diffuse within the firm. Natural optimism should find a willing audience; more strained versions will be greeted with increasing levels of skepticism among mid-level managers-who are just as likely to engage in self-serving construal, although with dif- ferent conclusions.'13 The notion that self-serving inferences are pervasive and hard to disentangle from business justifications indicates an interesting con- nection between social psychology and conventional economics. Though a clear violation of the standard rationality assumption, this form of inference offers a reason to expect people to behave the way economists predict-in the pursuit of self-interest-even though they deny in good faith that they are acting in anything but a fair and rea- 152 This is emphasized in Brown, supra note 148, at 651-60 (noting that denial, ra- tionalization, self-aggrandizement, and attributional egotism are ego-defensive behav- iors that may lead to ultimate failure); see alsoJennifer A. Chatman et al., The Managed Thought: The Role of Self-Justification and Impression Management in Organizational Settings, in THE THINKING ORGANIZATION, supra note 20, at 191, 209-10 (noting that organiza- tions put substantial effort into rationalizing actions and events); Hayward &amp; Hambrick, supra note 139, at 107 (noting that success reinforces a CEO's stature but often leads to self-serving attributions rather than self-critical ones). In turn, this sense of entitlement to the status quo (or aspirations built on it) may trigger a host of cognitions and behaviors designed to cling to it. For instance, one of the standard bi- ases identified in the literature (under the heading of prospect theory) suggests that people will take greater risks in order to avoid a loss than to seek a gain. See, e.g., Amos Tversky &amp; Daniel Kahneman, Rational Choice and the Framing of Decisions, 59 J. Bus. S251, S258 (1986) ("A significant property of the value function, called loss aversion, is that the response to losses is more extreme than the response to gains."). Accord- ingly, self-serving managerial biases may ultimately lead to risky decisions to preserve the status quo, all hidden from consciousness in the name of "businessjudgment." 153 This leads to the natural point that there is not likely to be a single corporate culture, but many subcultures with greater or lesser linkages. Because corporate dis- closure tends to be in the hands of a small group at the top of the organization, it would not be surprising to find self-serving interpretation a significant influence on the content of filings and official publicity.</page><page sequence="46">146 UNIVERSI TY OFPENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 sonable fashion. 154 As ethicists increasingly recognize, antisocial be- havior in business settings may be less the product of base moral cor- ruption than of the ability of normal people in stressful environments to distort and rationalize. 55 In this sense, self-serving inferences may be particularly useful in understanding the nature and persistence of agency costs and the moral hazards in organizational economics. 5. Bundling the Stories Although each of the foregoing behavioral biases is interesting by itself, the practical implications follow from their interplay. Burgel- 156 man's story of Intel recounted at the beginning of this Article is es- sentially one of senior management's inertial resistance to the discon- firmation of a highly success-oriented schema, albeit in a setting where learning ultimately did occur. As such, accounts of why com- panies make misleading disclosures should seek to integrate the vari- ous biases. And from these biases, it is easy to tell a generic story be- hind the kind of fraud allegation involving Apple Computer,157 Time- Warner,'58 Polaroid,'59 and many other defendants in the "false opti- mism" cases. In most of these cases, a highly successful organization undertook a course of action with respect to some product or finan- cial strategy and was sued for not disclosing some bits of adverse in- 154 For this reason, the kinds of selfish "last period" behavior that Arlen and Carney describe, see supra notes 40-44, 46 and accompanying text (discussing Arlen and Carney's theory), is likely to be subject to self-deception. The managers engaged in such behavior will not recognize it as such but will develop business-oriented rationali- zations. 155 See Russel Hardin, The Psychology of Business Ethics, in CODES OF CONDUCT, supra note 149, at 342, 359 ("At first cut, it is plausible that there is far more failure of ra- tionality than morality in organizations ...."); Barry A.

This is precisely the kind of situation where each of the biases can readily operate: The firm was successful, and no doubt had a good deal of aggregate self- esteem; the adverse bits of information were slow in coming and in- consistent with well-established schemas; and there was a heavy com- mitment to the success of the projects. It is perfectly plausible that, especially in the first small steps toward committing to the project-a point of very high ambiguity-individual managers were particularly optimistic. In the early stages of the project, this optimistic schema was resistant to the first (still ambiguous) bits of potentially discon- firming information. By the time their seriousness started to become clearer, there was a high degree of commitment to strengthen the prevailing beliefs, not to mention strong political reasons for preserv- ing the status quo. Moreover, by that time the managers were com- mitted to their publicly expressed optimism, from which they could not easily step away, even as the signs of trouble became palpable. Only at that late stage was there a truly deliberate form of dissem- bling. The temporal interplay between initial overoptimism (leading one to underestimate the risk of later dilemmas at the beginning of a course of action) and the commitment bias (leading toward continua- tion once those first steps are completed)-an optimism-commitment "whipsaw"-is an especially interesting explanation for why otherwise good people often find themselves responsible for bad behavior.'60 We can also draw some important connections between the or- ganizational-cognition accounts discussed earlier in this section16' and the informational account offered in Part II.161 Information flow is likely to be distorted not only (or even so much) by conscious distor- tion, but also by biased interpretation.163 To the extent that managers exhibit both cognitive conservatism and an optimistic-or self- serving-frame of reference, fewer danger signs will qualify for re- porting treatment as unusual, and those that do will tend to have a positive spin. This more subtle winnowing and revisionism is re- 160 See John M.

For this reason, I would revise the analysis in Part II to reduce the emphasis on deliberate information distortion and put in its place the assumption that a good bit of reporting is in good faith, but nonetheless misleading.</page><page sequence="48">148 UNIVERSITY OFPENNSYLVANIA LAWREV7EW [Vol. 146: 101 peated at each relay point, with predictable effects on the final mes- 164 sage. B. Can Biases Persist? The tension between the orthodox economic and the alternative social-science accounts of organizational behavior is most clearly posed in a single question: If business firms exist in competitive envi- ronments, will not market forces weed out those firms that act in a less-than-rational, and hence inefficient, fashion? 65 In other words, should we not expect those firms with unrealistic belief systems that do not learn from their errors to disappear, leaving only those that have successfully countered the problem of cognitive bias? This Dar- winian question is particularly apt because the problems of manage- rial myopia and excessive optimism are hardly unknown within the business community; scores of books, consultants, and educational programs exist to alert managers to them and point to ways of avoid- ing them.166 Many companies have adopted structures designed spe- cifically to avoid biases in the decisionmaking process.167 Answering this question is the most important item on the behav- ioral-research agenda. Before turning to a set of responses, however, it should be emphasized that even if competitive forces do gradually weed out firms that generate unrealistic belief systems, the process of decisionmaking remains descriptively interesting. Our immediate ef- fort is to explain why companies might deceive the stock markets, and to see what this says about securities law. Unless we make the strong 164 Argyris and Sch6n, for example, contend in a review of Burgelman's account of Intel's cognitive blindness that senior management's myopia can be only a partial ex- planation for its inability to hold its competitive lead. Their additional explanation is that "defensive" breakdowns in communication prevented senior management from becoming fully aware of the possibility of the loss of position. See ARGYRIS &amp; SCHON, supra note 8, at 218-21. 165 See supra note 111 (discussing the general debate on this subject between economists and psychologists). For a legal perspective, see Roberta Romano, A Com- ment on Information Overload, Cognitive Illusions and Their Implications for Public Policy, 59 S. CAL. L. REv. 313 (1986). 166 Some examples of books or articles that specifically address organizational "debiasing" are BAZERMAN, supra note 128, at 196-99;JANIS &amp; MANN, supra note 116, at 367-404; JAMES G. MARCH, A PRIMER ON DECISION MAKING (1994); and Mary Reis Louis &amp; Robert I. Sutton, Switching Cognitive Gears: From Habits of Mind to Active Thinking, 44 HUM. REL. 55 (1991). 167 Some banks, for example, keep their work-out teams separate from their lend- ing groups to avoid the commitment bias. See Staw, supra note 142, at 585 (discussing a comparative study examining two banks coping with delinquent loans).</page><page sequence="49">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 149 and unrealistic assumption that overly optimistic or otherwise biased organizations never even enter markets in which more rational com- petitors exist, the category of companies that might be charged with fraud will always include some that are at risk of being eliminated be- cause of their bias, but have not yet been. This "temporary entrant" category-with some hyperbole, the corporate equivalent of Barnum's new sucker born every minute 68-would still be of signifi- cance to understanding the nature and sources of corporate decep- tion. Indeed, given that corporate failure of some sort or another is a common precursor to class-action litigation, it may be a particularly important category. We need not rest here, however, for there are other survivability accounts that deserve careful consideration, each interesting by itself but, like the biases themselves, probably most powerful in combination. 1. Contingency, Imperfect Competition, and the Limits of Learning from Experience The first possible answer to the question of why competition does not assure organizational rationality is an obvious one: There is no such thing as a fixed or immutable organizational belief system. Al- though corporate cultures do allow for a certain degree of stability even when there is substantial turnover of key personnel, they can and do shift over time. The most obvious example of this is what March and his colleagues refer to as a competency trap.169 A firm may 168 Lynn Stout has made a similar point regarding investor behavior. See Lynn A. Stout, Are Stock Markets Costly Casinos? Disagreement, Market Failure, and Securities Regula- tion, 81 VA. L. REV. 611, 639-40 (1995) (noting that each new generation of investors has a subset of investors who are overly optimistic of their abilities to trade). 169 See Barbara Levitt &amp; James G. March, Organizational Learning, 14 ANN. REV. SOC. 319, 322 (1988) ("[A] competency trap can occur when favorable performance within an inferior procedure leads an organization to accumulate more experience with it, thus keeping experience with a superior procedure inadequate to make it rewarding to use."); see also Danny Miller, What Happens After Success?: The Perils of Excellence, 31J. MGMT. STUD. 325, 326 (1994) ("[M]anagers tend to attribute success to some pet pol- icy, strategy or process, which as a result, becomes resistant to change."). Levitt and March also stress, as do many other theorists, the difficulties associated with learning from experience in any situation where feedback is not both unambiguous and prompt, something rarely observed in business settings. See Levitt &amp; March, supra, at 320 (stating that routines "adapt to experience incrementally in response to feed- back"); see also, e.g., Berndt Behmer, In One Word: Notfrom Experience, inJUDGMENT AND) DECISION MAKING 705, 719 (Hal R.

At that point, it establishes a reputation and perhaps a protectable market niche (through intellectual-property protection or proprietary internal knowledge) that give it a natural advantage over its competition. As the firm ages, this advantage may generate free cash flow that provides an additional buffer from mar- ketplace forces.170 Even orthodox economists recognize that at this point, the power of competitive forces can diminish and the firm will turn inward in its behavior.17 Under the standard account, that facilitates managerial entrenchment and selfish behavior by incumbent executives (to which we can add, based on the self-deception discussion in the pre- vious section, the possibility of self-serving inference perceived by the incumbent managers as if it were good business judgment) .72 With product-market forces blunted, labor-market forces become less pressing, especially if the managers have invested much human capi- tal in the particular firm.

The likelihood that capital providers (for example, shareholders) will use their legal rights to demand replacement of existing management, though a grow- ing possibility, is still the exception rather than the rule.

Gordon Smith, Corporate</page><page sequence="51">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 151 firm that is too inward looking may fail as technology evolves and competitors are able to alter the competitive environment. The point, however, is that because of variations in the intensity of compe- tition, we cannot assume that firms with bias-filled cultures will neces- sarily die quickly. Their biases may persist for unusually long periods of time. The result, for our purposes, is an enlargement of the cate- gory of companies that at any given time might be susceptible to the kinds of disclosure distortion that come from cognitive bias. Indeed, there is a strong strand in the "organizational ecology" literature that suggests that eventually nearly all successful firms are destined for failure as their perceptions and routines ill-prepare them for changes in technologies and market conditions. 174 Quite separately, we should also take note of the difficulties asso- ciated with organizational learning and rational choice. Once a firm has exploited some technology and established itself in its market, it becomes increasingly difficult to discern what the best strategic op- tion is. And when some choice is made, it is difficult to tell whether it was successful or not. Signals from the environment are highly am- biguous and often delayed. Nearly all failures can be ascribed, if ob- servers are so inclined, to intervening and unforeseen situational fac- tors rather than flaws in the decision.175 Such environments frustrate organizational learning and rational decisionmaking. In this kind of setting, rational choice readily gives way to superstitious learning, and decisions and processes that are more symbolic than real,176 not be- cause the company is not motivated to act rationally, but rather be- Governance and Managerial Incompetence: Lessons from Kmart, 74 N.C.

Soc. REV. 149, 149 (1984) (arguing "that selection processes tend to favor organizations whose structures are difficult to change"). More recently, there has been greater attention to the possibility of organizational adaptation to new envi- ronments, although the substantial likelihood that success (ultimately) breeds failure is still recognized.

Adaptive Biases The second set of explanations for why biases might persist is dif- ferent and potentially more profound. Put simply, there is reason to suspect that firms that inculcate certain types of belief systems may in many settings be competitively superior to those that are more dog- gedly "realistic." Though counterintuitive, this possibility finds a great deal of support in the social-psychology research relating to in- dividual and group behavior. As noted, there are essentially two classes of bias. One is the kind of bias arising naturally from bounded rationality and constraints on cognitive-processing ability.'78 At the level of the firm, it is quite pos- sible that stable perceptions and routines are necessary to allow it to focus on an objective and exploit it fully-even if the resulting tunnel vision eventually poses significant risks in times of external change.'79 This is the virtue of organizational cognitive conservatism. It can be adaptive in two senses: First, it simplifies thinking by allowing the firm to dismiss large amounts of information; second, it is often accu- rate insofar as stability is more common than change. In an am- 177 Here again we should note the interplay with the information-flow analysis: Learning is difficult to the extent that communication barriers (structural or cultural) prevent senior executives from gaining a realistic picture of any given situation. See, e.g., ARGYRiS &amp; SCHON, supra note 8, at 211 (stressing "the 'inertial' lag of formal cor- porate strategy in relation to shifting conditions in the competitive environment"). In addition to all this, we should note one other element of contingency: Over time, a firm's expectations will change, triggering other forms of bias that are related to the perception of the status quo. See, e.g.,James G. March &amp; Zur Shapira, Variable Risk Pref- erences and the Focus of Attention, 99 PSYCHOL. REV. 172, 177 (1992) (discussing the "rate of aspiration adjustment" and "focus-of-attention" effects on organization). 178 See supra note 113 (discussing purely cognitive biases). 179 In Kenneth Arrow's words, "the very pursuit of efficiency may lead to rigidity and unresponsiveness to further change." ARROW, supra note 60, at 49. For a good expression of this in the managerial literature, see DANNY MILLER, THE ICARUS PARADOX (1990), and Miller, supra note 169, at 330. This is also a common theme in the industrial-evolution literature. See, e.g., Michael T. Hannan &amp; Glenn R. Carroll, An Introduction to Organizational Ecology, in ORGANIZATIONS IN INDUSTRY 17, 23-25 (Glenn R. Carroll &amp; Michael T. Hannan eds., 1995) (explaining the challenges of structural inertia in established firms); Rebecca M. Henderson &amp; Kim B.

Conversely, in a stable atmosphere, individual managers and employ- ees, as well as such external constituencies as customers and suppli- ers, can rely on the firm to stick to a set of routines, and so are more willing to "invest" in it for the intermediate-term future.'81 In sum, one adaptive quality of narrow organizational perception is to focus the firm's resources and attention on what it has for the time found that it can do well 8 and avoid the informational paralysis that often comes from seeing and thus dwelling on too many risks or opportuni- ties. The other kind of bias is the motivated one,183 and here we see a more fascinating possibility. Much research on individual cognition indicates that the most successful person, on average, tends not to be the realist, but rather the optimist.184 High levels of self-esteem and self-efficacy are associated with aggressiveness, perseverance, and op- timal risk-taking.85 These biases may be particularly adaptive in busi- plified management of large amounts of data); Miller, supra note 121, at 118 (describing benefits of simplified focus in organizations). 181 See Walter W.

Certainly, overconfidence at times leads to disaster and severe career failure. Those who fail too visibly are often weeded out. However, there is little evidence that successful managers learn humility very well.'87 Instead, they rechar- acterize their minor failures in self-serving terms. They take the at parent absence of major failures, maybe from luck as much as any- thing else, as proof of superior skill. High levels of optimism and confidence are not only good internal motivators, but they also influ- ence others; exhibitions of confidence and optimism make people more persuasive and influential."' There is no reason to believe that the same would not be true for organizational cultures generally.'89 In the same vein as David Kreps's (discussing the potential impact of accountability for assessments immediately follow- ing the task being assessed). From a research perspective, it is hard to determine whether such illusions are the cause of positive behavior, or whether initial success leads to high levels of optimism and control, thereby becoming a self-fulfilling proph- ecy.

See Heath &amp;Jourden, supra note 132, at 114 (discussing</page><page sequence="55">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 155 hypothesis that a culture that emphasizes trust can allow the organiza- tion to signal more effectively the credibility of its commitments,190 we observe that an optimistic culture can have a number of adaptive vir- tues. It is an ideal motivator, creating the expectation of future growth and profitability that leads individuals to invest their human capital in the firm more willingly and to defer present consumption in favor of future rewards. Firms with "can-do" cultures will thereby generate higher levels of internal effort and, by projecting self- confidence, be more successful in attracting external resources.191 Conversely, an optimistic culture can blind managers to the kind of anxiety about the future that might otherwise trigger both the sort of self-serving inference and the selfish "last period" kind of behavior that might operate to a firm's detriment.192 Faced with risk or trouble, agents will more likely persist in normal, functional activity than act self-protectively if the firm has successfully inculcated a belief system that rests on images of efficacy and control. Of particular interest here is the relationship between optimism and trust. In recent years, scholars have come to recognize that the pervasiveness of trust within an organization is positively correlated with efficiency and productivity. In turn, optimism should correlate with trust.193 In any joint enterprise, the potential for opportunistic the buffering effect of groups); see also Yechiel Klar et al., Nonunique Invulnerability: Singular Versus Distributional Probabilities and Unrealistic Optimism in Comparative Risk Judgments, 67 ORG.

For an expression of the view that certain kinds of biases (including optimistic ones) are more often found in start- up firms than well-established ones, see Lowell W. Busenitz &amp;Jay B. Barney,Differences Between Entrepreneurs and Managers in Large Organizations: Biases and Heuristics in Strate- gic Decision-Making, 12 J. BUS.

In some ways, we can generalize this point by saying that cultures mediate the egocentric perceptions of most human beings. In strong cultures, selfishness and self-serving inferences are dampened. But cultures cannot be manufactured at will; it takes persuasion to influence the collective perceptions of the group members. Hope and optimism, in turn, are particularly persuasive images when they can be communicated plausibly. Cf. Langevoort, supra note 3, at 633-34 (describ- ing the motivations of investors to trust in optimistic advice). 193 On the importance of trust, especially in periods of organizational stress, see Aneil K Mishra, Organizational Response to Crisis: The Centrality of Trust, in TRUST IN ORGANIZATIONS, supra note 72, at 261.

The greater the sense of future well-being from joint effort, the less likely opportunism becomes. Observable (and hence cascading) patterns of cooperation can then emerge-including reduced distortion in lines of information flow'94-facilitating the development of a culture that has a higher-than-normal level of trust. In light of the potentially adaptive virtue of optimism and related biases (for instance, the illusion of control), we can see how social forces that lead groups of managers not to see some risks (or to con- strue them unrealistically) could have a positive payoff on average. While there are serious costs associated with ignoring danger signs in a small subset of cases, these costs may be outweighed by the profit- ability produced by the benign influences of organizational self- deception in others. When we couple this with the other virtue of risk deflection, the ability to maintain consistency and focus, we can see at least a plausible response to the "survival of the rational" claims of conventional economics. Indeed, although little of it relates spe- cifically to organizational behavior, much of the work on the persis- tence of unrealistic optimism has been generated by sociobiologists working from strong Darwinian assumptions. 195 trust when parties enter a relationship in pursuit of personal economic advantage); William G.

On the psychological mecha- nisms in group trust, see Debra Meyerson et al., Swift Trust and Temporary Groups, in TRUST IN ORGANIZATIONS, supra note 72, at 166. An implicit understanding along these lines thus facilitates thousands of daily interactions. See supra note 105. An in- teresting body of scholarship, in both law and economics, has considered the effects of breaches of implicit contract (a trust concept) on efficiency and morale. See, e.g., Bruce Chapman, Trust, Economic Rationality and the Corporate Fiduciary Obligation, 43 U. TORONTO L.J. 547 (1993) (challenging the contractual view of the corporation be- cause of its failure to account for the duties of loyalty and trust). It would not be sur- prising to find that cultures that were highly optimistic generated the highest level of hope and thus the most intense feeling of betrayal when the optimistic bubble was popped.

The Legal Implications of Bias If corporations habitually tend toward cognitive conservatism, overcommitment, overoptimism, and selfish inference, there is a con- siderable likelihood that the subjective forward-looking elements of their disclosure and publicity will have the potential to mislead. Of course, market professionals and other savvy investors will discount many kinds of corporate hype and, at least in those settings where ef- ficiency properties predominate, such disclosures may have minimal market-price impact.196 On the assumption, however, that managers do have unique access to certain kinds of risk-related information such that some marketplace dependency on managerial inference is inevitable,'97 the possibility of socially inefficient market-price distor- favor of more flexible mechanisms for producing goods and delivering services. See Gilson, supra note 22, at 340-41 (describing the nexus between corporate governance mechanisms and diminishing product life span). Perhaps that shift will create a set- ting in which narrow vision and focus, and other myopic kinds of organizational biases we have identified, will have less capacity to survive than they have had previously. Surely, we must concede that the survivability of these biases is historically contingent, and research that looks at the current or past environment may not describe the fu- ture. For commentary on the balance between stability and adaptability, see Lance B. Kurke, Does Adaptation Preclude Adaptability?: Strategy and Performance, in INSTITUTIONAL PATTERNS AND ORGANIZATIONS 199 (Lynne G. Zucker ed., 1988). Although these points are well taken, my intuition is that both optimism and self-serving inference are likely to remain pervasive even if the virtues of narrowed focus and conservatism erode. Cf. Meyerson et al., supra note 193, at 186 (determining that positive illusions contribute to the resilience of swift trust in a temporary group). 196 See, e.g., COX ET AL., supra note 11, at 61 (noting that "information as to the cost and performance of [a] new computer series was already widely known in the industry, so that [a] misstatement did not affect the mix of information" (citing Beissinger v. Rockwood Computer Corp., 529 F. Supp. 770, 781-82 (E.D. Pa. 1981))); Roger J. Dennis, Mandatoiy Disclosure Theory and Management Projections: A Law and Economics Perspective, 46 MD. L.

Kraakman, The Mechanisms of Market Efficiency, 70 VA. L. REv. 549, 635-42 (1984) (questioning the effect on prices based on manda- tory disclosure requirements). Investment analysts and other professional investors can, in many cases, test management's inferences by contacting customers, suppliers, and other experts for alternative points of view about the company's prospects. To date, neither legal scholars nor economists have specified the point at which profes- sional-investor reliance on managerial inference is apt to occur. There is a sense that even professionals may be subject to some predictable biases, notwithstanding market constraints. See, e.g., Tilman Ehrbeck &amp; Robert Waldmann, My Are Professional Fore- casters Biased?: Agency Versus Behavioral Explanations, 11 1 Q.J.

The normative question then looms: What changes to the prevailing rules of securities regulation might we consider in light of this heretofore unexplored possibility? The most natural response is consistent with the points made ear- lier about the relevance of information-flow blockages.198 If we are se- riously interested in deterring corporate deception, then fraud liabil- ity should not turn on conscious awareness by the specific senior executives responsible for corporate communications of the mislead- ing nature of their misstatements or omissions. I have doubts about how often, in hindsight, judges and juries would actually recognize an instance of cognitive blindness and refuse to impose liability.199 At least in principle, however, an awareness requirement much too read- ily protects the kinds of marketplace distortions that securities regula- tion wants to prevent. To overcome this, the law would want to create incentives (if not direct requirements) to force the "debiasing" of corporate inference. Within the scienter-based regime of Rule 10b-5, the first step toward achieving this end would be to develop a definition of corporate sci- enter that focuses on the attribution of knowledge to the firm. Such emphasis would echo a comparable doctrinal development in the law of insider trading, within which liability turns on simple possession of information rather than identifying a specific misuse of it by natural 200 persons within the organization. In response, corporations wishing to avoid liability would have an incentive to bring into the disclosure portion of required SEC filings. The optimistic bias of these disclosures has been ob- served. See Moses L. Pava &amp; MarcJ. Epstein, How Good Is MD&amp;A as an Investment Tool?, 175J. ACCT. 51, 52-53 (1993) (noting that the SEC's original goals in requiring this section may not be satisfied in practice). Yet it still has the capacity to reveal new in- formation and thus affect prices. See Stephen H. Bryan, Incremental Information Content of Required Disclosures Contained in Management Discussion and Analysis, 72 ACCT. REV. 285, 298 (1997) (discussing the short-term price impact of the SEC's mandatory dis- closure requirement). Presumably, analysts apply some sort of bias discount that var- ies depending on issuers' reputation for credibility. 198 See supra notes 84-96. 199 For reasons having to do with the hindsight bias as well as the tendency to at- tribute blame to dispositional rather than situational factors, juries may not be moved by claims of lack of awareness based on cognitive bias. See Langevoort, supra note 6 (manuscript at 34-35) (suggesting that juries are motivated to explain bad events in terms of malfeasance). If this is the case, we might have too much enforcement, at least within the traditional understanding of the scienter requirement. 200 See United States v. Teicher, 987 F.2d 112, 120-21 (2d Cir. 1993) (suggesting that insider-trading liability does not depend upon a showing that the information led to the trading and that "knowing possession" is enough); LANGEVOORT, supra note 34, ? 3.04 (discussing the inconsistent case law in this area).</page><page sequence="59">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 159 process persons not subject (or less subject) to the same biases. De- pending on the type of information in question, management con- sultants, accounting firms, and law firms could offer a useful, though by no means fail-safe, therapeutic intervention.20' In areas of special concern, the law could go one step further and mandate such intervention. In essence, the due-diligence require- ment for underwriters and accountants under section 11 of the Secu- rities Act of 1933202 is based on a mistrust of management as the ex- clusive source of firm-specific information,203 thereby requiring a "bonding" of disclosure completeness and accuracy by outside profes- sionals (who in turn also have their own reputational interests at stake). While this historic mistrust is probably based more on the fear of deliberate cheating than cognitive bias, the independent evalua- tion of data involved in a due-diligence investigation provides a useful antidote to bias in initial public offerings and other settings where it is both required and practicable.204 Securities regulation could also choose to extend this more broadly to some standard requiring ongoing disclosures by public companies.

BarChris Construction Corp., 283 F. Supp. 643, 688 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (holding that the defendants failed to meet the burden of proof that damages suffered by the plaintiffs were caused by factors other than material misrepresenta- tions and omissions in the prospectus), as one in which (in contrast to the court's in- terpretation) management optimistically underestimated the severity of the risk asso- ciated with building bowling alleys for customers. Had they done their jobs, the various professionals might have introduced a less rosy assessment of that risk. To simplify, the essence of the fraud allegations in BarChris was the nondisclosure of con- tractual provisions relating to the company's construction projects, pushing much of the risk of marketplace failure on the company. See id. at 653-54. Without questioning the court's conclusion relating to the materiality of this information, it is not implau- sible that senior management failed to appreciate the nature and extent of the risk it was retaining because of some biased perception.</page><page sequence="60">160 UNIVERSITY OFPENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 tions and estimates would create this sort of third-party intervention in an area highly susceptible to bias. Even more aggressive would be a required due-diligence investigation of publicly traded firms every three or five years.205 Conversely, the SEC might take a stronger stand against the loss of due diligence that has come from the gradual shift of more and more capital raising to the shelf-registration system. That system preserves due-diligence liability but makes it practically impossible to do it well once the registrant has decided that the mar- ket window of opportunity is open, but may close in a day or two.206 There is no lack of possible interventions, but two concerns should also be evident. First, note the difficulty in achieving the gains. With respect to highly subjective kinds of construal-for in- stance, those regarding research and development, product quality, or marketing-"audit" or due-diligence techniques may not work par- ticularly well. Information of that sort cannot easily be separated from the perceptions of those with firsthand knowledge of the busi- ness. The natural response of managers and other employees faced with attempts by skeptical third parties to assess their objectivity may well be either to freeze the third parties out of the information loop or engage in impression-management techniques that blur the pre- . . . ~~207 vailing reality. Second, note the magnitude of the precaution costs involved. As discussed earlier, investors pay heavily for third-party investigations, both in the direct fees paid by the issuer to the professionals for their time and effort, and in the risk premium to compensate for their li- ability exposure.208 Whether this delivers fair value, given savvy inves- tors' ability to filter out some biases and plumb alternative sources of 205 SeeJames D. Cox, The Fundamentals of an Electronic-Based Federal Securities Act, 75 WASH. U. L.Q. 857, 883 (1997) (proposing a continuous reporting system, perhaps every third year). 206 See Committee on Fed. Regulation of Sec., Report of the Task Force on Sellers' Due Diligence and Similar Defenses Under the Federal Securities Laws, 48 BUS. LAW. 1185, 1207 (1993) (noting the inadequate time available for underwriters to discharge their due- diligence responsibilities adequately). 207 In addition, it is possible that cognitive biases may affect the ability of such out- siders to perceive the risk, especially if they are not really outsiders but have some con- tinuing relationship (and commitment) to the company. With respect to auditors, see Bazerman et al., supra note 201, suggesting that it is "psychologically impossible for auditors to maintain their objectivity," id. at 90; and Mark W. Nelson &amp; William R. Kenney, The Effect of Ambiguity on Loss Contingency Reporting Judgments, 72 AccT.

But one is also entitled to ask whether biases built on overoptimism, at least, are ones with which we really want to interfere through legal intervention, even if we could. If optimism is adaptive in that companies do better if they develop be- lief systems that deflect awareness of the seriousness of some kinds of risks, is it really the kind of belief system we want to discourage? So- cial psychologists suggest that the class of persons least prone to ex- cessive optimism and the illusion of control is the clinically de- pressed.2' We run the risk of having third-party interventions causing official company statements that, if successful, dampen the internal morale of the senior managers and perhaps the company culture as a whole. Those that fall short of success simply operate as expensive and disruptive monitoring systems with little to show in the way of * * ~~~~~~~212 improved disclosure. Those uncomfortable with these various costs might be tempted to move to the opposite extreme and seek to immunize overoptimism from legal attack. Indeed, there has been a fascinating line of cases 209 See StephenJ. Choi, Company Registration: Toward a Status Based Antifraud Regime, 64 U. CHI. L. REv. 567, 587 (1997) (discussing the ability of third parties to perform gatekeeper functions). 210 Under the pleading standards put in place in 1995, plaintiffs face dismissal of their suits if they cannot put forward facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter. See 15 U.S.C. ? 78u-4(b)(2) (Supp. 1995). In many ways, this is the most significant hurdle imposed by the legislation. See ElliottJ. Weiss, The New Securities Fraud Pleading Requirements: Speed Bump or Road Block ?, 38 ARiz. L. REv. 675, 676 (1996) (concluding that the pleading requirement is "more of a speed bump than a road block" for a plaintiff because of the different factual requirements of different courts). It does seem likely that plaintiffs are more likely to survive the motion to dismiss (and thereby gain immense settlement leverage) if they are simply required to create an inference that the truth was within the organization at large, rather than having to create the inference that the corporate speaker knew the truth. 211 See FisKE &amp; TAYLOR, supra note 115, at 214 (suggesting that individuals with measured low self-esteem or moderate depression, or both, exhibit more accurate self- appraisals). 212 My sense is that in many situations the lawyer's challenge is a severe one: Bi- ased cultures may strongly resist meaningful public acknowledgment of the serious- ness of risk, leading to boilerplate risk disclosure at best.</page><page sequence="62">162 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 in the 1990s, beginning with the Fourth Circuit's decision in Raab v. General Physics Corp.,213 that goes substantially in this direction. Under this view, general corporate statements of optimism are immaterial as a matter of law. While at base this is just common sense-some statements of optimism are so general and contentless (for example, "This is a great company with a great future.") that we can hardly imagine any investor seriously relying on it alone, or even a cluster of similar platitudes-the cases themselves protect statements that are far from standard puffery. Concern that this provides too much room to deceive the reasonable investor has led other courts, like the First Circuit in Shaw v. Digital Equipment Corp.,214 to limit the doctrine. In terms of protecting reasonable reliance, the parsimonious use of this doctrine is clearly correct. When viewed in context, general state- ments of optimism can mislead.215 On the other hand, Raab and its progeny do create the ability to weed out-without the need for fact- intensive discovery into corporate state of mind-the kinds of cases where optimistic bias, rather than intentional deceit, is particularly likely to have driven the allegedly misleading disclosure.216 213 4 F.3d 286, 291 (4th Cir. 1993) (holding that predictions about future earnings in annual report are immaterial); see also Eisenstadt v.

Litig., 900 F. Supp. 1217, 1234-35 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (holding that the projected earnings had sufficient cautionary language to be nonactionable). In addition, one could justify such a rule by reference to the possibility that an overly optimistic corporate face is so natural and normal that the sophisticated market simply assumes the presence of the bias.

Here a positive gen- eral statement might have a lulling effect, even on professional investors. 216 While the Raab line of cases only protects general statements of optimism, there are other possibilities open to one inclined to protect optimism. The new safe harbor for forward-looking information protects projections and estimates by seasoned com- panies if made either without actual knowledge of their falsity or with "meaningful cautionary statements" accompanying them. 15 U.S.C. ?? 77z-2(c) (1) (A), 78u- 5 (c) (1) (A) (Supp. 1995); see Carl W.

More broadly, one could</page><page sequence="63">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 163 The tensions for securities-law doctrine raised by the possibility of bias are present with respect to all forms of publicity, but most impor- tantly with respect to concealment cases. Under the so-called "duty to update" adopted by some circuits, for example, companies have a proactive responsibility to inform the marketplace when events evolve in such a way as to render misleading some prior statement upon which the market is still relying. In re Time Warner Inc. Securities Litiga- tion is a good example, where the Second Circuit found that Time Warner might have violated Rule 10b-5 by not issuing a press release after it became clear that its prior strategy of seeking financial part- ners would have to be abandoned in favor of a dilutive stock offer- ing.21 Courts have not done a good job of explaining the scienter re- quirement here: Must there be some conscious awareness, or some realization, that continued silence is (or in terms of recklessness, may be) misleading?218 Or is that a legal question of duty, for which igno- rance is no excuse-in which case scienter is largely meaningless? As- suming the former, one can readily see how difficult it will be for management to come to a conscious awareness of the need to ac- knowledge the change, given management's commitment to the prior course of action and its natural optimism that success may still be just around the corner. The risk of hindsight bias here is also extremely high, creating another reason for those who worry about the spillover costs of regulation to doubt that a broad duty to update (or at least heavy civil liability for breach) is really a sensible legal doctrine.2 reconceptualize the focus of securities-law disclosure away from investment-related information generally (which is naturally susceptible to bias) in favor of a system that simply tries to force disclosure of matters relating to managerial competence and in- tegrity. See Paul G. Mahoney, Mandatory Disclosure as a Solution to Agency Problems, 62 U. CHI. L.

Heublein, Inc., 742 F.2d 751, 758-60 (3d Cir. 1984) (recognizing the theory, but holding that no duty to correct existed because defendant was never under a duty to disclose its first statement). The duty exists when management has made a specific forward-looking statement that is still "alive" in the marketplace at the time the new information appears. See Ross v. A.H. Robins Co., 465 F. Supp. 904, 908 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) ("It is now clear that there is a duty to correct or revise a prior statement. . so long as the prior statement[] remains 'alive."'), revd on other grounds, 697 F.2d 545 (2d Cir. 1979); COX ET AL., supra note 1, at 713-14 (discussing duty to update). 218 On this topic, but without clear resolution, see State Teachers Retirement Board v.

BEYOND CORPORATE DISCLOSURE: OTHER SOcIAL HARMs From the foregoing prediction that a corporation's disclosure to investors may sometimes be distorted, not in bad faith, but rather be- cause cognitive forces and information-flow problems lead to a skewed perception of reality by senior officials, we can extend the same story to other sorts of social harms with little difficulty. At the risk of some repetition, the following account is a generic story of "wrongdoing" that is more a failure of rationality than an example of venality. My aim here is simply to suggest that this genre of organiza- tion theory has the potential to inform a broad range of issues in civil and criminal law, where the anthropomorphic conception of the firm still weighs heavily as well.220 Responding to strong internal and external pressures both to grow and to increase profitability, most management groups search continually for new technologies to exploit, such as a new product line or new mechanisms for producing current ones more efficiently. An auto manufacturer, for example, might determine that it is worthwhile to introduce a highly inexpensive automobile to play in the market for young or low-income purchasers (such as the Pinto, 221 manufactured by Ford in the 1970s). Alternatively, a textile manufac- turer might purchase more efficient, high-speed looms to respond 222 more effectively to foreign competition. Predictably, some of those judgments will turn out to be socially harmful-for example, a deci- Polaroid Corp., 910 F.2d 10, 16-18 (1st Cir. 1990) (en banc) (refusing to apply the doc- trine to the facts of the case and raising questions about its viability). Indeed, the Sec- ond Circuit itself recognized that the duty must be limited lest it interfere with legiti- mate corporate confidentiality needs. See San Leandro Emergency Med. Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Cos., 75 F.3d 801, 809-10 (2d Cir. 1996) ("We are con- cerned about interpreting the securities laws to force companies to give their competi- tors advance notice of sensitive pricing information."). 220 A recent symposium in the Southern California Law Reuiew was devoted to organ- izational-tort liability, with special attention to issues of vicarious liability. See Corporate Tort Law Symposium, 69 S. CAL. L. REv. 1679 (1996). The "anthropomorphic" claim is made in Steven P. Croley, Vicarious Liability in Tort: On the Sources and Limits of Employee Reasonableness, 69 S. CAL. L. REv. 1705 (1996). On criminal law, see sources cited supra note 4, summarizing various uses of organization theory. See also Barry D. Baysinger, Organization Theory and the Criminal Liability of Organizations, 71 B.U.

See generally Symposium, A National Conference on Sentencing of the Corporation, 71 B.U. L. REV. 189 (1991). 221 The Pinto case, of course, is well studied as a matter both of law and business ethics. See, e.g., Gioia, supra note 118, at 380-81 (discussing Ford's introduction of the Pinto in record time to compete with foreign corporations). This example comes from JACKALL, supra note 69, at 101-05.</page><page sequence="65">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 165 sion to lower the safety level of a car to passengers and other motor- ists, or increasing the noise level of looms, causing gradual hearing loss to workers. The normal, culturally conditioned response is to say that these corporations have chosen profits over social responsibility deliberately. Yet, in many cases, the ultimate costs (monetary and reputational) after being caught and penalized exceed the gains that reasonably could have been predicted at the time.223 Sometimes firms do simply discover some patentable new product or technology and enter the development and marketing stage com- pletely confident of success. But this rarely occurs. Most strategic steps are taken in an atmosphere of extremely high ambiguity, espe- cially in the early stages. A new product or manufacturing process is an interesting possibility, but answers to questions of successful manu- facture, time frame, cost, market impact, and risk are all highly uncer- tain. The high-level executive decision to move ahead with such a project is a political act, for it will place resources and opportunities in the hands of some managers rather than others. The political bat- tling for resources requires careful impression management (most ef- fective, as we have seen, if the proponents believe their own self- serving representations).22' Here, natural optimism, coupled with impression-management demands, leads to presentations to top offi- cials that put aside risks (which are highly indeterminate anyway at this early stage) and overstate the project's potential.225 The senior executives faced with the resource-allocation decision probably rec- ognize the likely bias, and other managers competing for the same resources will try to pick at the idea's soft spots. "Go ahead" decisions are not easy to elicit. Even so, most senior executives also recognize that decisions must be made, even in the face of high ambiguity. 223 That fact alone is not dispositive, of course. There can be rational choices for social harm, for instance, if either the risk of detection or amount of penalty is subop- timal. See generally GEORGE EADES &amp; PETER REUTER, DESIGNING SAFER PRODUCTS 52-72 (1983) (discussing some of the decisionmaking behind the manufacture of dangerous materials from a more rationalist, but still critical, perspective); Wendy E. Wagner, Choosing Ignorance in the Manufacture of Toxic Products, 82 CORNELL L. REv. 773, 810-27 (1997) (arguing that the current system of liability encourages manufacturers to make socially nonoptimal decisions concerning product-safety research). 224 See supra notes 148-55 and accompanying text. 225 For a case study on this problem, see Andrew D. Brown, Politics, Symbolic Action and Myth Making in Pursuit of Legitimacy, 15 ORG. STUD. 861 (1994). See also Andrew H. Van de Ven &amp; Douglas Polley, Learning While Innovating, 3 ORG.

For these reasons, choices are made, typically with a commitment to monitor the chosen project in its early stages so that it can be abandoned at relatively low cost should difficulties or risks surface. Once the project begins, those closest to the situation (the win- ners) have ample motivation to believe in its efficacy-their natural optimism has now been rewarded by positive feedback from the top. They are committed to a positive schema, and they recognize the po- litical reality that the project can still be killed, so they wish to manage the flow of information to prevent this from happening.227 An envi- ronment is thus created that leads those with immediate access to in- formation to sense, without full awareness necessarily, that risk- related information will provoke stress and potential loss. Common defense mechanisms are employed. After all, it is still early in the project, so that any risks that surface at a conscious level remain speculative and temporally remote, and thus are still susceptible to rationalization. It becomes easy to explain them away and preserve the aura of optimism. As a result, either the risks are not reported at all, or they are communicated upward in a way that dulls them. Even if there should be some conscious shading of the truth in reports to superiors, it is probably not in bad faith, given the winners' optimistic schema. Omission of certain information can be readily justified as a means of avoiding disclosure that superiors might take out of context, overreact to, or otherwise misunderstand. Higher-ups are then un- likely to sense serious cause for concern. To the extent that there is significant diffusion of responsibility for surveying incoming information for danger signs, the ability to de- flect signs of risk increases. Diffusion increases the ambiguity associ- ated with one's own stock of data, and the act of raising a red flag 226 See NILS BRUNSSON, THE IRRATIONAL ORGANIZATION 21-28 (1985) (noting that the role of a decisionmaker is to motivate the organization to action and that uncer- tainty can lead to bewilderment and confusion); ROBERT G.

MAHER, LEADERSHIP AND INFORMATIONAL PROCESSES 66 (1991) (noting that one corporate leader's "personality, being much more conservative, indecisive, and aloof, did not fit well with expectations for typical leaders" (citation omitted)). 227 This portion of the story borrows from Darley's account, see Darley, supra note 160, at 21-22, 28-36, of corporate misbehavior, especially his recounting, from a social- psychological perspective, of B.F. Goodrich's production of faulty brake assemblies for military aircraft, based on Kermit Vandivier, Why Should My Conscience Bother Me., in CORPORATE VIOLENCE 145 (Stuart L. Hills ed., 1987).</page><page sequence="67">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 167 threatens the newly established (and probably quite strong) group cohesion. If the private information is ambiguous and no one else acts troubled, the pressure is strong to dismiss the information. Now let us assume that more significant, and less ambiguous, danger signs gradually appear to those with the most direct access to the information. Here, of course, the biases are likely to shift even more from the cognitive to the motivated. Postdecisional commit- ment becomes stronger: The winners are not only emotionally, but also economically, invested in the project, the unwinding of which is likely to have very troublesome career implications for those who find themselves in this particular probationary crucible. They may well be in something of a personal "last period." Their psychological resis- tance hardens, and the temptation to distort disconfirming informa- tion increases-still, however, not necessarily in bad faith (though, at this point, some background awareness of trouble may surface). The competition between conscience and motivated rationalization con- tinues until the information becomes so clear-cut that its implications are unavoidable. Once again, to the extent that access to information is highly diffused, that may take quite some time. Presumably there comes a time, however, at which an awareness of the project's risks or dangers crystallizes. At that point, an active cover-up might begin, though at the same time the once-thought-to-be winners may well also start believing in a self-serving fashion that sufficient disclosure of the risks was made such that responsibility for continuing the project rests more with those higher up than with them. The important point, of course, is that the final awareness of the risk or harm occurs some- what after the point in time at which, both practically and legally, the responsible actors are likely to be held accountable. This is the opti- mism-commitment whipsaw effect.228 As one of the more polite say- ings goes, the managers find themselves "knee-deep in the big muddy. ,229 As to supervisory executives a step or two removed from the proj- ect itself, their ability to monitor is compromised by two basic factors. The first is the likely distortion of information. Even if some senior 228 See David C. Wilson et al., How Organizations Can Overbalance: Decision Overreach as a Reason for Failure, 39 AM. BEHAV.

As Chris Argyris argues, many corporate cultures discourage open expressions of doubt and skepticism, which skew the information flow.230 The second is the increasing commitment of the superior who approved the project as the investment in the project increases. Nearly all firms do have accountability or internal-control systems designed to prevent information distortion of a gross sort. Account- ing-control systems are well-suited to monitor the use and disposition of corporate assets, but on a basis that emphasizes current and his- toric reporting, not future trends. Information relating to product and technology risks shows up only very late in budgetary or financial controls. There may be other compliance functions as well, but these all tend to lack direct access to information about subjective matters such as product development and engineering defects. What infor- mation senior managers do see is likely to be fairly ambiguous, and their own biases (cognitive conservatism if nothing else) can readily lead to their ignoring some kinds of risks. Dennis Gioia's study of the failure of Ford's recall departments to become aware of the Pinto's danger to consumers in light of its heavy workload (such that limited time and attention could be given to any particular matter), and the ease with which initial crash information could be explained away in terms that suggested minimal, containable danger, provides a good 231 example of the limits of external monitoring. Now that we have a plausible account that can fit many sorts of "corporate misconduct" cases, from the manufacture of defective products to the disposal of toxic waste to the adoption of manufactur- ing processes that threaten worker health or safety-all potential torts or crimes-we might ask of what significance it all is. Because both tort and criminal law pursue so many competing objectives, I could 232 not hope to offer a single answer. The attribution of blame is a so- 230 See supra note 78. 231 See Gioia, supra note 118, at 386-88. Of course, companies could build more intrusive and effective monitoring systems, but these are likely to be very expensive and imperfect, threatening to overall corporate morale (and hence efficiency), and subject to manipulation in any event. See supra note 72 and accompanying text. 232 There are obvious questions about whether it is "unreasonable" to ignore risks because of very natural and commonplace psychological and social mechanisms. Cognitive limitations have become increasingly interesting to torts scholars, in terms of both victim and wrongdoer behavior. See, e.g., Howard A. Latin, Problem-Solving Be- havior and Theories of Tort Liability, 73 CAL. L. REV. 677, 745 (1985) (arguing that tort liability and compensation systems should be keyed to the attention parties give to</page><page sequence="69">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 169 cial act for which blameworthiness must sometimes be manufactured to maintain the illusion of a controllable world, especially when there are identifiable victims.233 But some observations may be useful, if not dispositive. For in- stance, from an economic standpoint, we see from the above how dif- ficult it might be for companies to price rationally to cover the risk of future harms from new products. In terms of deterrence, to say that organizations have natural biases hardly argues by itself for a shift from vicarious to individual actor-based liability; individuals are bi- 234 ased as well, maybe more so. While groups sometimes exacerbate biases, that is not always the case, and there is always the potential to build into the corporate system checks and balances that reduce the likelihood that one or a small number of biased managers will cause significant social harm. What does seem likely is that highly indeterminate legal stan- dards-such as those based on "reasonableness" or "good faith"-will have a less direct impact on firm behavior than we would like to 235 think. The managerial bias is to perceive the firm's actions as both reasonable and in good faith. In this light, a legal rule mandating that a company face a penalty if it acts unreasonably will not be all that potent in affecting day-to-day activity. A rule mandating "reason- ableness" or "good faith" ignores the many reasons that managers, and thus organizations, resist becoming aware of either unreason- ableness or bad faith. Because managers fail to perceive unreason- ableness and bad faith, they cannot modify their conduct in response 236 to the legal rule. risk); W.

Scholars are increasingly willing to recognize "overlegalized" organ- izational responses. These are most likely to occur either when the legal dictate is highly salient and unambiguous, or when peer organizations have responded visibly so that a claim to legitimacy is at stake. See Donna M. Randall &amp; Douglas D. Baker, The Threat of Legal Liability and Managerial Decision Making: Regulation of Reproductive Health in the Workplace, in THE LEGALISTIC ORGANIZATION, supra note 75, at 169, 181</page><page sequence="70">170 UNIVERSITY OFPENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 There are thus grounds to fear organizational insensitivity to cer- tain kinds of legal dictates.237 The natural response for the law would be to increase the sanctions, hoping to make the law salient enough to break through the organization's thick cognitive defenses.238 As (discussing a large mining firm which adopted extensive fetal-protection policies as a result of "vivid cues of legal liability"). Additionally, when there are competing claims within the organization about the proper course of action, legal dictates (both to avoid the threat of liability and to gain external legitimacy) can be used to break the logjam. See Martha S. Feldman &amp; Alan J. Levy, Effects of Legal Context on Decisionmaking Under Ambiguity, in THE LEGALISTIC ORGANIZATION, supra note 75, at 109, 127-28 ("[T]he law narrows the frame of reference and limits what is relevant to decision making in at least three specific ways. It limits the issues that are under consideration. It specifies procedures for introducing information as relevant to an issue. It establishes defini- tions that constrain all claimants."). It is entirely possible that legal actors within or- ganizations may overstate the law's dictates (or overstate its ambiguity) to give them- selves a greater claim to organizational resources. See Lauren B. Edelman et al., Professional Construction of Law: The Inflated Threat of Wrongful Discharge, 26 L. &amp; SoC'Y REV. 47, 80 (1992) (discussing overstatement of wrongful-discharge law by the legal and personnel professions); Donald C.

Schwartz, Reality in the Economic Analysis of Tort Law: Does Tort Law Really Deter?, 42 UCLA L. REv. 377 (1994). See also Wagner, supra note 223, at 810-22 (arguing that cur- rent tort law discourages safety research). To be sure, as noted above, high sanctions can prompt certain kinds of ex ante structural responses to minimize the likelihood of unlawful behavior. But we also have seen that monitoring and detection systems work better for some kinds of harms than others. A strong threat of liability for hazardous- waste discharge, for instance, can prompt firms to establish environmental audit and testing offices outside of the normal lines of operational authority to avoid the prob- lem caused by biased perception and reporting of environmental compliance by plant managers. See Max H. Bazerman et al., Environmental Degradation: Exploring the Rift Be- tween Environmentally Benign Attitudes and Environmentally Destructive Behaviors, in CODES OF CONDUCT, supra note 149, at 256, 261-66 (discussing self-serving biases that impede people's ability to address environmental problems). In fact, there is no phase of a corporation's business that could not be double-checked by some independent authority from within or outside the firm that is specifically charged with establishing legal compliance. Independent monitors would lack the kinds of biases borne of commitment and conflict of interest that plague the primary line managers. Yet we rarely observe such intrusive compliance mechanisms. The reason, probably, is that the risk of serious defective products or harmful manufacturing processes is low any- way, so that highly expensive monitoring and testing systems are hard tojustify. Their indirect costs, as we noted earlier, are also considerable, since overprecaution puts the firm at a severe competitive disadvantage. See supra notes 208-10 and accompanying text. Furthermore, senior managers are likely to underestimate the possibility of the harm occurring in the first place, and may well overestimate their ability to detect and control it on a day-to-day basis through more normal oversight of their line managers. 238 Obviously, this is not the only strategy. Government monitoring or required third-party intervention could also address the problem, but again, at considerable</page><page sequence="71">1997] ORGANIZED ILLUSIONS 171 sanctions grow more draconian, however, we encounter the familiar problem of overprecaution.239 Firms will add layers of legal audit, product testing, and other compliance units, which impose a burden on productivity, slowing down research and development timetables, and making it more likely that the company -will forgo attractive com- petitive opportunities. The risks associated with the overlegalized corporation are well noted in the literature,240 and without a more so- phisticated empirical understanding of organizational behavior, it is hard to predict whether any given high sanction will tend to overde- ter rather than strike the right balance. CONCLUSION Because organizations are so pervasive in society, theories of or- ganizational behavior are rarely far from the surface in legal dis- course. When tort law asks about deterring the manufacture of dan- gerous products, or securities law about the desire to compel truthful disclosure to investors, the problem is posed clearly: Whatever rule or policy the law favors will have to affect the behavior of a disparate but interrelated group of human actors, not just a single individual, if it is to be effective. Addressing this intelligently demands that we know something about how behavior changes and outcomes occur in set- tings of diffused, but connected, power and responsibility. Precisely because so many important normative matters in law depend on implicit (often naive) theories of organizational behavior, building a more robust account of such behavior is intellectually valu- able. In practical terms, moreover, there is virtue in drawing norma- tive conclusions from accounts that conform better to the often jaun- diced intuitions and experience of judges, administrators, and other cost. Although it is beyond the scope of this Article, there is ample reason to believe that government agents bring their own biases to bear on regulatory problems, creat- ing different-but still costly-distortions. See, e.g., Clayton P. Gillette &amp; James E. Krier, Risk, Courts, and Agencies, 138 U. PA. L. REv. 1027, 1090-99 (1990) (discussing decisionmaking biases of agencies). 239 See Bruce Chapman, Corporate Tort Liability and the Problem of Overcompliance, 69 S. CAL. L. REv. 1679, 1687-94 (1996) (discussing the problem of excessive levels of cor- porate care). Chapman's fear that corporate overcompliance may be more of a prob- lem than undercompliance may be correct for any number of reasons outside the scope of this Article. My point is simply that tort law should take into account the po- tential for cognitive resistance in assessing its general strategy. 240 See, e.g., Jeffrey Pfeffer, The Costs of Legalization: The Hidden Dangers of Increasingly Formalized Control, in THE LEGALISTIC ORGANIZATION, supra note 75, at 329 (discussing the costs of the "legalistic mentality" in American corporations).</page><page sequence="72">172 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 146: 101 policymakers on the subject of organizational rationality. While I hope to have generated a handful of usable practical insights for the formulation of securities-law policy, this Article is also meant to be an early step toward the development of a usable general theory on how organizations respond to legal dictates. Assuming that these insights survive criticism and testing, the kinds of hypotheses drawn here re- garding organizational cognition and rationality could eventually help both scholars and policymakers assess with far greater realism and sensitivity the costs and benefits of alternative legal strategies in those settings in which organizations are dominant economic actors. For either securities law or the law generally, that would be no small contribution.</page></plain_text>
