ABRAM LERNER The exhibition Mr. Lerner toured with Jacques Lipchitz at the Guggenheim Museum, Modern Sculpture from the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Collection, ran from October 3, 1962, to January 6, 1963. Immediately afterward Mr. Lerner made notes of their conversation and wrote the vivid account we print here along with his explanatory paragraphs. IN 1963 ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FOUR works of sculpture from the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Collection were displayed at the Guggenheim Museum, filling all its levels. It was the first time the collection's sculpture was shown as a group and it created quite a stir. The painter, curator, and museum director Abram Lemrner (b. 1913) was most instrumental in developing the immense modem art collection of Joseph H. Hirshhom. Mr. Lemrner was associate director of the American Contemporary Art (ACA) Galleries in New York in 1945, the year he met Hirshhom. He acted as an informal adviser to the voracious collector until 1957, when he became curator of Hirshhom's collection. Under his guidance the collection grew from twelve hundred to six thousand objects at the time of its merger in 1967 with the Smithsonian Institution. In that year Mr. Lemer became director of the Hirshhom Museum and Sculpture Garden, which opened in October 1974. Shortly after the exhibition's opening I called Jacques Lipchitz to invite him to lunch and to view the show with me. I was eager to have his comments because he was a participant in the exhibition and one of the pioneers of modem art. The following is an account of our meeting. Remember that this was writ- ten in 1963. Lipchitz is an energetic man, still youthful in appear- ance, his face unlined and his hair worn rather long. He was dressed in a grey business suit, a shirt and tie, and a black sweater. The collar of his shirt was rounded at the ends like a little boy's and kept sticking up over his sweater. He was somewhat cautious when he arrived but soon gave way to a friendly manner which was frank and outspoken. He wondered if we had met before and I said we had, but briefly, in a large company. We went to lunch in the museum's restaurant, which was then located on its lower level. Lipchitz ordered a quarter of boiled chicken which he ate with great gusto, hardly using his knife and fork, holding the chicken with his fingers and going over every inch of bone and tendon. While con- centrating on his food he kept up a steady stream of conversation. His thoughts seemed to crowd him and lead him from subject to subject, but he made the tran- sitions easily and with grace. 8</page><page sequence="2">He began by speaking of unethical practices by deal- ers and some artists in producing unlimited editions of casts or unauthorized editions. He felt it was a danger- ous practice which did great harm to art and artists alike and endangered accurate historical records. He was particularly strong on the subject and declared that both artists and collectors should be protected from such practices. He urged me to pursue the subject and try to arouse the interest of our lawmakers to enact protective legislation. This, he thought, would in its way be as great a contribution to sculpture as the for- mation of the Hirshhom Collection. Staying on the subject of historical accuracy he remarked on the fact that artists too often tended to pre-date their work. The artistic ego is so strong it cannot admit someone else has discovered something first, so that a Cubist-style piece done in nineteen twenty-four is dated nineteen fourteen. One must be on guard and consult publica- tions and catalogues of a period to determine what was actually made at a given time and by whom. One should also take an overall view of an artist's work and ask, "Was he really able to do such a daring thing, was it in his character and ability to have done it?" He then went on to talk about his arrival in the Jacques Lipchitz, Figure, 1926-1930 (cast in 1958-1961). Bronze, 85I/8 x 38'/2 x 29'/4 in.

He landed in New York with twenty dol- lars to his name, and he and Mrs. Lipchitz settled in the basement of a boarding house in the Seventies near Broadway. He couldn't speak a word of English but somehow managed to get by with Yiddish. In the hot summer he and his wife discovered Coney Island and Brighton Beach and went every Sunday. Once there, they rested on boardwalk benches and puzzled their neighbors, as Lipchitz read his French newspaper and Mrs. Lipchitz her Russian paper. He had no sculpture on his arrival here, only some drawings. The art dealer Curt Valentin came to see them, called various collectors, and managed to sell six hundred dollars' worth, which he gave to Lipchitz without taking any commission for himself. With an additional loan of five hundred dollars Lipchitz rented his first studio and began to work. He emphasized that he had been offered teaching jobs from the time of his arrival but had refused them because of his conviction that teaching can only destroy an artist's development. He had fled from Europe so he could remain alive to do his work and if he had to do other things that would prevent him from working steadily then all his efforts to save his life would have been in vain. Returning to the drawings that had begun his career in the United States, he said that shortly after his 9</page><page sequence="3">arrival he began to frequent the antique shops on Third Avenue (he was, and still is, an avid collector). One day he inquired about the price of a Rodin drawing which he described as a "beauty." Twenty-five dollars was all they asked. "Imagine!, for the work of a great artist, a master, only twenty-five dollars, while I was asking a hundred and fifty for my own drawings. I felt ashamed." He then turned to the nature and unity of art which, he said, must encompass all the elements that con- tribute to it, not just one or two. He compared it to love, which he said existed on many levels-that which propagates the race, the pleasure which makes it possible, and its emotional and psychological aspects. Each of these were incomplete experiences by them- selves but in concert they could make a masterpiece. He also spoke of the religious and sociological influ- ences which shape the art of an epoch and make that art unique. He contended that anthropomorphism in pre-Christian cultures resulted in sculpture that was concerned with the beauty and perfection of the human form, while Romanesque sculpture denied the significance of life on earth and created images that were elongated, spiritualized, and transitory, reaching for another world. During our lunch and after I made no attempt at a formal interview. Our entire conversation was impromptu and, if you will, random. After lunch we walked through the exhibition. Lip- chitz said that, while he could not like everything in such a large display, he nevertheless thought it was the best of its kind that he had ever seen. He expressed admiration for Mr. Hirshhorn, who he felt had brought great benefits to sculpture, and said that the exhibition marked a turning point for the art in its acceptance by the public. He thought it was the handsomest exhibi- tion he had seen in the Guggenheim and only found fault in the placement of the Burghers of Calais and a few other Rodins. As for his large Figure, he believed it would have been more effective in the center of the entrance hall. When I suggested it might constitute a traffic hazard, given the crowds, he laughed and said no one could possibly knock over his piece although they might fall down if they ran into it. The exhibition was arranged in sections, with each artist having his own. As we walked, Lipchitz would stop from time to time and comment on a particular artist. These observations were often more like verdicts than opinions. They went something like the follow- ing: Modigliani was highly gifted but unfulfilled; his tal- ent was wasted on drink, and he lived an undisciplined life that ended before he could realize himself. The "romantic" aspects of his life have appealed to people and made him not only popular, but highly priced. Nadelman was a prodigy, a wunderkind who amazed Paris with his first exhibition in 1909. He was such a controversial figure that in Matisse's school a large placard stated "It is forbidden to discuss Nadelman." Lipchitz thought that Nadelman was a neglected figure whose importance resided in his being the last signifi- cant link to the classical past. He did not believe it was the alien atmosphere in America that diminished Nadelman's power but rather that the fault was inher- ent in the man, a weakness that prevented the youth- ful prodigy from becoming the mature genius. Brancusi was a primitive, an immaculate craftsman, but an artist of limited and oversimplified ideas in art. Lipchitz recalled that his studio in Paris neighbored on Brancusi's, and that all day long he could hear the uninterrupted and mechanically regular tap, tap, tap of Brancusi's hammer. He confessed he didn't care for Brancusi's work then or now. An artist whose ambi- tion was to reduce the complexities of life and its forms to an egg shape was too archaic for him. "An egg," said Lipchitz, epitomizing Brancusi's work, "has been made round and smooth because it issues from a chicken's behind-that's not where art comes from." Duchamp-Villon, said Lipchitz, was originally an architect whose idea was to "cubise" communities, and he died too soon to accomplish significant work. That is why Lipchitz confessed he didn't know how it was possible for Duchamp-Villon to have created his large Horse and the preliminary studies for it. He felt it was too sudden an advance in too short a time and related it to Futurism and to Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descend- ing the Stairs. "You know," Lipchitz said with a grin, "he had very clever brothers," and left me to draw my own conclusions. As for Braque, he was very doubtful that Braque had invented Cubism. He thought Braque was extremely gifted and knowledgeable, but that it was inconceiv- able that he could have created such a revolutionary concept. "Look at the Braque Little Horse," Lipchitz said, "is this the work of a great innovator? On the other hand, look at anything Picasso put his hand to and you must say, 'Yes, that is a great inventor, a great innova- tor.' " He expressed great admiration for Matisse as a painter but seemed unimpressed with his sculpture. I had the impression that he didn't think Matisse's sculp- ture was experimental enough, a criticism that he seemed to apply to all sculpture. In front of the Henry Moores he recalled that he had seen an exhibition of English artists at the British- American Art Center and had urged Curt Valentin to purchase the Moore drawings and give Moore his first exhibition in the United States. When we arrived at the section devoted to Lipchitz's own work I asked him what he thought of it. "Well," he replied after a few moments, "when I think of all the sacrifice and hard work that went into it, it could have been better." With this modest appraisal, we parted. I saw him to the door of the museum and never met him again. el 10</page></plain_text>
