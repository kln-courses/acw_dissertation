Since the birth of modern science, philosophers, scientists, and other thinkers have wrestled with this fundamental question of scientific practice. Efforts to devise rigorous methods for obtaining scientific knowledge include the twenty-one rules Descartes proposed in his Rulesfor the Direction of the Mind and the four rules of reasoning that begin the third book of Newton's Principia, and continue today in debates over the very possibil- ity of such rules. Bringing together key primary sources spanning almost four centuries, Science Rules introduces readers to scientific methods that have played a prominent role in the history of scientific practice. $29.95 paperback MINIMAL THEOLOGIES Critiques of Secular Reason in Adorno and Levinas HENT DE VRIES translated by Geoffrey Hale "Truly original. For anyone concerned with the critical theory of the Frankfurt school, deconstruction, and develop- ments in theology, this is obligatory reading.
