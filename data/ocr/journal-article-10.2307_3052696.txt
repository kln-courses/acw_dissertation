<plain_text><page sequence="1">H. WILEY HITCHCOCK "A Grand and Glorious Noise!": Charles Ives as Lyricist Many of the songs of Charles Ives are well known, but their texts re- main to be studied in depth.' This article attempts to suggest the po- tential of such study, introducing Ives as lyricist; not only, however, Ives as author of lyrics but also as borrower of lyrics by others-and in fact not only borrower but manipulator, editor, adapter to his own purposes, and even transmogrifier into song lyrics of texts never in- tended as such by their authors. My focus will be the lyrics in the book of 114 Songs that Ives had privately printed in 1922, plus a few others first printed in Henry Cowell's New Music editions of the 1930s.2 Ives wrote about 150 solo songs; he revised some 30 of those with different texts. About 40 of the songs' lyrics are securely attributable to Ives himself, about 10 more probably or possibly so. A few others are by Ives but "after" or "plus" other writers (for example, the text of "My Native Land" [114 Songs, no. 101], an English adaptation af- ter Heine; or "Old Home Day" [114 Songs, no. 52], which begins with a quote from Virgil but goes on with lyrics by Ives). And eight lyrics are by Harmony Twichell (Ives's wife), usually with Ives's collabora- tion.3 Thus, Ives had a hand as lyricist, wholly or partially, in more than one-third of his songs. That, however, is only part of the story. Study of the lyrics of Ives's 100 other songs, by almost as many au- H.

Before turning to Ives's song lyrics, let us recall American song in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when Ives was writing songs. Tin Pan Alley and the popular music theater abounded with songs, with distinct stylistic types materializing along the way: com- ic songs, tragic songs, sentimental songs, dialect songs.4 Most are in verse-and-chorus form, major mode, with waltz or ragtime rhythms; a few, less stereotyped, aspire to an almost operatic-aria level of seri- ousness in both text and music. At home, genteel parlor songs-not yet threatened by recordings or radio-were in full cry. (I choose my noun carefully.) And art songs-in the hands of composers of the Sec- ond New England School and the Dvofikian "nativists" (Arthur Far- well, Henry F. Gilbert, Charles Wakefield Cadman, and others)-had a respectable if minor place in American concert culture. Their lyrics tended to high-falutin artificiality. Consider just one stanza from the first song in a cycle of 1897 by George Whitefield Chadwick: Sweetheart, the blood leaps in thy cheek; Sweetheart, thy very heartthrobs speak; Sweetheart, to chide I am too weak, My heart so hotly beating Is still thy name repeating, Sweetheart, to still it seek.5 Or consider the text written by Edward MacDowell for one of his Three Songs, op. 60, of 1902: Where e'er Love be, Tyrant he, Without merci; Plead as thou may, Ah me! He ne'er thy tears will see, Ah me! Light wings hath he As any bee; Let not him free, For he alone, Ah me! He alone can rule the kingdom he Hath won, Ah me! But hold him close, ma mie, As bishop to his see, for me!6 Amy Cheney Beach wrote some exceptional songs; we mustn't blame her too much for an 1894 setting of a text titled "Just for This!" by</page><page sequence="3">28 Hitchcock Cora Randall Fabbri (perhaps a Boston friend)-it is typical of a kind of coy cuteness of the time.7 Here are a few verses: Just a multitude of curls Weighing down a little head; Two wide eyes not blue nor grey, Like the sky 'twixt night and day; Small red mouth-and all to say Has been said. Just a saucy word or glance, And a hand held out to kiss; Just a curl-a ribbon through- Just a flower-fresh and blue.... And to think what men will do- Just for this! Ives wrote songs of virtually every type that I have mentioned- and then some (except for dialect songs, of which he wrote none). No wonder that Aaron Copland reacted in 1934 to the book of 114 Songs as he did: "Almost every kind of song can be found... German, French, and Italian songs, war songs, songs of religious sentiment, street songs, humorous songs, hymn tunes, folk tunes, encore songs; ... intimate songs, cowboy songs, and mass songs."8 Ives's song lyr- ics are just as diverse. But another point Copland made leads to my first generalization about those lyrics. He claimed that "Ives... not only had no public in mind when printing this book[:] the truth is that he had only himself in mind." I would put a different slant on it: infinitely more than any of his contemporaries who wrote songs- whether for the musical theater, the parlor, or the concert platform- Ives the songwriter speaks with his own voice. I use that phrase in the sense that Edward Cone does in his bril- liant lectures published as The Composer's Voice.9 Cone's thesis is that a song is a vehicle of the composer's musical persona-a complex phenomenon, as Cone analyzes it. He summarizes: "Because in song the complete musical persona embraces both vocal and instrumental components, the composer's persona governs words as well as mu- sic. The words, that is, have become a part of the composer's mes- sage, utterances of his own voice."10 Ives, in the lyrics of his songs as well as in their music, speaks with his own voice more strikingly than any of his contemporaries-consciously, assertively, forcefully. This is partly why so many of his songs seem so personal, so ineluctably "Ivesian," and why more than one commentator on the collection of 114 Songs has viewed it as a kind of journal, its songs as journal en- tries, and the whole songbook as a kind of autobiography."1</page><page sequence="4">"A Grand and Glorious Noise!" 29 The texts by Ives himself that most immediately speak with his own voice are the vignettes of ordinary life, or reactions to it, on which he based some songs. Epigrammatic, aphoristic, virtually American haiku, these prefigure the unique Half Minute Songs of Carrie Jacobs- Bond (but those are "cute" and only semi-serious, and Ives's mini- songs transcend them textually as well as musically).12 Ives's text for "The See'r" (114 Songs, no. 29) is not a poem at all but an observer's comment about an observer: An old man with a straw in his mouth sat all day long before the village grocery store; he liked to watch the funny things a-going by! (He turns the setting of that text into a miniature "tone poem"-to coin a new meaning for that mixed metaphor.) Or consider Ives's text for "The Cage" (114 Songs, no. 64): A leopard went around his cage from one side to the other side; he stopped only when the keeper came around with meat. A boy who had been there three hours began to wonder, "Is life any- thing like that?" Ives's text for his song "Soliloquy" (1907)13 also has but two sentences: When a man is sitting before the fire on the hearth, he says, "Na- ture is a simple affair!" Then he looks out the window and sees a hailstorm, and he begins to think that "Nature can't be so easi- ly disposed of." Ives returned to this Emersonian theme years later in one verse of the song "On the Antipodes" (1915-23):14 "Sometimes Nature's nice and sweet, as a little pansy. And sometimes it ain't." Ives's briefest original poetic lyric, but also one of his most evoca- tive and suggestive, is that of no. 12 in 114 Songs. The score is unti- tled (though headed by an epigram taken from Wordsworth: "The music in my heart I bore,/Long after it was heard no more"); the song- book's "Index" (actually, its prefatory table of contents) offers "Re- membrance" as a title: A sound of a distant horn O'er shadowed lake is borne: My father's song.15 Others of Ives's lyrics, speaking perhaps even more directly and powerfully in his own voice, are more expansive. One is "Majority," which has pride of place as the opener of 114 Songs. Its text is like a psalm, with verses built in complementary half-verses-an appropri- ate vehicle for Ives to express his majoritarian sociopolitical creed. The first two verses are:</page><page sequence="5">30 Hitchcock The Masses have toiled; Behold the Works of the World! The Masses are thinking; Whence comes the Thought of the World! And the final two verses are: The Masses are dreaming; Whence come the Visions of God! God's in His Heaven; All will be well with the World! Less optimistic, more furious with "the World"-at least with pol- iticians and voters-is Ives's text reacting to the defeat of the Wilso- nian Democrat James Cox in the presidential election of 1920. In "Nov. 2, 1920" (114 Songs, no. 22), Ives even quotes himself in the first-per- son singular: "It strikes me that... Some men and women got tired of a big job;... Prejudice and politics, and the stand-patters came in strong, and yelled, 'Slide back! Now you're safe, that's the easy way!'" And it ends with an agonized cry of the heart: "Oh, Captain, my Captain! A heritage we've thrown away; But we'll find it again, my Captain, oh, my Captain!" (The "Captain" is Abraham Lincoln, as Whitman had characterized him.) I shall return to Ives later as a more lyrical lyricist. Here, let me turn to texts by other writers that Ives appropriated-usually transform- ing their writings as he turned them into song lyrics. There are some surprises among his borrowings. To Longfellow, Ives turned only once, to set the first three stanzas (of ten) of "The Children's Hour" (114 Songs, no. 74). Whitman, too, gets short shrift: only one song is to a Whitman text, a few lines from "Song of My- self" for the song titled simply "Walt Whitman" (114 Songs, no. 31). And Emerson, though one of Ives's intellectual idols, seems not to have appealed to him as a poet: he set only four lines by him, for the song "Duty" (114 Songs, no. 9a), first of a pair originally titled "Two Slants (Christian and Pagan)": So nigh is grandeur to our dust, So near is God to man, When Duty whispers low, Thou must, The youth replies, I can. That quatrain comes from the third of Emerson's Voluntaries of 1863.16 For Ives, its Pollyanna-like, not to say Rollo-esque, sentiment proba-</page><page sequence="6">"A Grand and Glorious Noise!" 31 bly had associations far more significant than the lines themselves. He would have known that Emerson wrote the set of five Voluntaries in honor of Col. Robert Gould Shaw's black regiment during the Civil War, in an abolitionist spirit with which Ives and his forebears were ardently sympathetic.17 Other American poets whose total absence from Ives's song roster may seem surprising include Poe, Julia Ward Howe, Melville, Dick- inson, Sidney Lanier, Edward Arlington Robinson, and Stephen Crane. Poets younger than Ives himself are scarce indeed, except for a few verses by some that Ives noticed in newspapers or other ran- dom sources and was sparked into turning into lyrics.'s Even Thoreau, another Ives hero, comes off poorly-but interest- ingly: Ives's lone song using words by Thoreau (titled simply "Tho- reau" in 114 Songs, no. 48) has music deriving from the "Thoreau" movement of Ives's Concord Sonata; the song text is a m6lange from the chapter on "Sounds" in Walden, partially quoted, partially para- phrased as if by memory. It begins with this passage, not to be sung but perhaps to be spoken by the singer as the pianist begins the song: ... His meditations are interrupted only by the faint sound of the Concord bell, "A melody, as it were, imported into the wil- derness. At a distance over the woods the sound acquires a cer- tain vibratory hum as if the pine needles in the horizon were the strings of a harp which it swept.., .a vibration of the universal lyre, just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth interesting to the eyes by the azure tint it imparts." The passage in Thoreau's "Sounds," paragraphs 14 and 15, from which Ives derived that text, reads as follows: ... For the rest of the long afternoon, perhaps, my meditations are interrupted only by the faint rattle of a carriage or team along the distant highway. Sometimes, on Sundays, I heard the bells, the Lincoln, Acton, Bedford, or Concord bell, when the wind was favorable, a faint, sweet, and, as it were, natural melody, worth importing into the wilderness. At a sufficient distance over the woods this sound acquires a certain vibratory hum, as if the pine needles in the horizon were the strings of a harp which it swept. All sound heard at the greatest possible distance produces one and the same effect, a vibration of the universal lyre, just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth interesting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to it.19 "Thoreau" continues with music to be sung, with this Ivesian varia- tion on Thoreau's text:</page><page sequence="7">32 Hitchcock He grew in those seasons like corn in the night, rapt in revery, on the Walden shore, amidst the sumach, pines and hickories, in undisturbed solitude. This derives from another passage in Thoreau's "Sounds" (paragraph 2): Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery, amidst the pines and hickories and sumachs, in undis- turbed solitude and stillness, while the birds sang around or flit- ted noiseless through the house, until by the sun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some traveler's wagon on the dis- tant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time. I grew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better than any work of the hands would have been. Such personal, not to say presumptuous, alteration by Ives of a bor- rowed text is typical of many of his lyrics. Let me zero in on a few instances, to suggest how Ives made such borrowings "speak with his own voice." Ives was no "Indianist" like Cadman or Farwell; he did choose, however, to set verses by the Boston banker and poet Charles Sprague (1791-1875), from Sprague's panegyric to Native Americans, his Cen- tennial Ode of 1830;20 Ives helpfully invented a title for his song, "The Indians" (114 Songs, no. 14): [1] Alas! for them-their day is o'er, a [2] -'Th -eif - I-r- ,-- f1&amp; I-hll 1 sand , a [3] No more for them the wild deer bounds; b [4] The plough is on their hunting grounds; b [5] The pale man's axe rings through their woods c [6] The pale man's sail skims o'er their floods, c [7] Tir*,p1asat springs a. dy, d [81 'Their hi-- d - 1- ,, b - . .............. e [9] Beyond the mountains of the west, e [10] Their children go-to die. d Ives omits three lines, in a felicitous transformation of this poem into a song lyric. Sprague's line 2 is not easily apprehended quickly by ear-and, by eliminating it, Ives can underline line 1's theme of the whole poem ("Alas! ... their day is o'er") by moving directly to line 3 ("No more for them," etc.). Line 7 is somewhat awkward, in the context of the other immediately evocative lines. And line 8-well, exactly what is the meaning of line 8? (One cannot tell until the end of line 10-a long time in a song setting.) And Ives-perhaps intu-</page><page sequence="8">"A Grand and Glorious Noise!" 33 itively, more probably consciously-understood that in lines 7-10 the d e e d rhymes, which we grasp easily when we read the poem ("... dry/... oppressed"; "... west/... die"), are not easily caught when the poem becomes song; they can be violated with impunity. Ives uses his editorial blue pencil similarly in "Romanzo (di Cen- tral Park)" (114 Songs, no. 96), setting an odd little poem by Leigh Hunt (1784-1859).21 The verses consist only of the last words of the lines of an imagined love lyric: Grove, Heart, Kiss, Night, Prove, Blest, Rove, Impart, Bliss, Delight, Love, Rest. Ives revises the poem this way: Grove, Heart, Kiss, Rove, Impart, Bliss, Night, Love, Blest, Delight, Prove, Rest, Then he adds a subtle improvisatory reprise of the central lines (with the poem's central theme): "Heart,/Impart, /Impart, /Impart, /Love." And, though he honors the poet's stanza-order, Ives alters the "line"- order, to produce paired, rhyming couplets ("Grove, Rove, Night, Delight," and so on). These allow the listener to the song (as opposed to the reader of the poem) to grasp the conceit of the poetry far more easily than would Hunt's "Grove, Night, Rove, Delight." Ives plucks poems-or parts of them-where he finds them. One inspired plucking was from Keats's sonnet "On Seeing the Elgin Mar- bles," of which Ives used lines 1-5 for one of his chamber songs "with or without words," arranging it later as the song "Like a Sick Eagle" (114 Songs, no. 26). Ives's two deletions in Keats's verses are italicized below, his replacements for them underlined: My The spirit is too weak-mortality Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep, And each imagined pinnacle and steep Of godlike hardship tells me I must die Like a sick eagle looking at toward the sky. Ives responded to-and identified with a moment of domestic trage- dy22-the first idea in Keats's sonnet, its despondent acknowledgment of our mortality. The remaining nine lines of the sonnet have noth- ing to do with this idea: it is overriden by the poet's awestruck vi- sion of the Elgin marbles, and Ives simply omitted them. Why Ives replaced, in line 1, Keats's "My" with the impersonal</page><page sequence="9">34 Hitchcock "The" is unclear; perhaps he disliked the near-repetition of "My" and "me" in lines 1 and 2. But his replacement, in line 5, of Keats's "at" by "toward" is cunning: it adds a certain weight to the sound; it im- parts a more dynamic, yearning quality to the eagle's gaze at the heav- ens; it connects the speaker/singer and the celestial realm; and it gives the singer a more vocally grateful and gracious sound than Keats's flat "at." The poem "Heaven" by Ives's British contemporary Monica Peveril Turnbull (1879-1901), whose work had been introduced to him by his fianc6e,23 was edited by Ives much more enthusiastically; perhaps "aggressively" is a better term. He did away entirely with Turnbull's title, calling his song simply "Where the Eagle" (114 Songs, no. 94), and he cut her text by half: [1] Where the eagle cannot see, a a [2] W here t. La-I........-L -' l Lt ... .. b [3] Where cold winds can never be, a a [4] Whe r -,t sule air at vrP OU, b [5] tAbove where.... b .....l..... h. _ h, CZ [6] - Grow .. f-t a.L. . ...fainter till th.ey dIJ--f c [7] Where the sun's bright course doth glow d b [8] Very, very far below, d b [9]O- . ..... P. 4 ,%-,_ fV, g _,,__ [101M oro ..and Star- light .t..l g. e [?] [11] There, in everlasting rest, f c [12] Dwell those saints whom Death hath blest. f c The result is a skillful condensation-a distillation into simplicity and clarity of Turnbull's core idea of the empyrean where, "in everlast- ing rest, dwell those... whom Death hath blest." One can only ad- mire Ives's elimination of the pseudo-rhyme in lines 9 and 10 (". ether/... together"), not to mention the peculiar image in line 9 of "miles of quivering ether!" Another nice touch is his invention of a new and wholly audible rhyme scheme: aa bb cc. If Ives cut to the core Monica Turnbull's "Heaven," he revised through strategic repetition some other borrowed lyrics. Perhaps best- known is the spin he gives to "Beautiful River" by the American hym- nodist Robert Lowry (1826-99). In the song "At the River" (114 Songs, no. 45), Ives sets only the first stanza of Lowry's hymn, which begins with the question "Shall we gather at the river?" and ends affirma- tively with the reply, "Yes, we'll gather at the river." Ives, however, turns back at the end to the opening line and asks again, now uncer- tainly, "Shall we gather, shall we gather at the river?"-exactly as his music does, with its unforgettably tentative vocal syncopes and lack of closure or cadence (ex. 1).24</page><page sequence="10">"A Grand and Glorious Noise!" 35 Ex. 1.

Used by permission of the publisher, Theodore Presser Company.</page><page sequence="11">36 Hitchcock Clarification and focus, rather than condensation or reinterpreta- tion, seem to have motivated Ives in the song he titled "His Exalta- tion" (114 Songs, no. 46). The text is by Robert Robinson (1735-90); it is a single stanza (the second of four) of the hymn "Christ is God": [1] For the grandeur of thy nature,- a a [2] Grand beyond a seraph's thought; b b [3] For the wonders of creation, c c [4] Works with skill and kindness wrought; b b [5] F r thy ..m ..tL.. 1th2atU g&amp;overn d [6] Through thine empire's wide domain, e d [7] Wings a1 a, .L , LIda6,k ,LIIf [8] Blessed be thy gentle reign. e d Ives's omission of line 7 removes one that is opaque in meaning and that clutters the text with two new images never developed (an an- gel and a sparrow); omitting them also removes the only concrete images in the text, leaving it wholly in the realm of abstraction and generalization. Omitting both lines 5 and 7 sharpens the focus of the poem (if also narrowing its theological premises: Ives dismisses God's "providence" but maintains God's natural "grandeur" and wondrous "creations"); and he links line 6 to line 8, not back to line 5. What is left is a tightly knit torso, clear in meaning-a meaning, however, not Robinson's but Ives's. In these collaborations between Ives and others-if we can call them that, since the others knew nothing of the collaborative enterprises- we see Ives tinkering with their work, turning it to new purposes, "speaking with his own voice" (reminding us, perhaps, of the many times he treated similarly compositions of his own, reworking and reusing them differently in different contexts). He collaborated in an- other way with Charlotte Elliott (1789-1871): when he decided to make into a song some passages from his Symphony no. 3, he turned to Elliott's familiar hymn "Just as I am, without one plea," borrow- ing the subtitle of the symphony for the title of his song "The Camp- Meeting" (114 Songs, no. 47). He used only the first stanza of Elliott's hymn, but he preceded it with six lines of his own invention: [Ives:] Across the summer meadows fair, There comes a song of fervent prayer; It rises radiantly o'er the world, Exulting in the power of God! Exalting faith in life above But humbly yielding to His love. [Elliott:] Just as I am, without one plea But that Thy blood was shed for me,</page><page sequence="12">"A Grand and Glorious Noise!" 37 And that thou bid'st me come to Thee, O Lamb of God, I come! I come! Peter Burkholder has sensitively described the result: "The narrator [whom we can identify here as Ives] is not singing the hymn but hear- ing it and naming the feelings it embodies. When at the end he quotes it (or, as it were, stops speaking, so we can listen to it ourselves from 'across the summer meadows'), he invites us to hear that same ex- ultant yet humble spirit behind the words."25 Among the most touching collaborations of Ives as lyricist are those with Harmony Twichell during their long courtship (about two years). Perhaps the first was "The World's Highway," sent him by her in the spring of 1907.26 She confessed in verse, toward the end of the poem, So when one day-O sweetest day! I came to a garden small, And a voice my heart knew called me in, I answered its blessed call.... Charles left Harmony's verses virtually unaltered in his somewhat genteel-though not kitschy and indeed rather subtle-musical set- ting (114 Songs, no. 90). In the following summer (August 14, 1907), Harmony sent from Sa- ranac Lake in the Adirondacks the verses later titled "Spring Song."27 Ives must have set them immediately-not, however, without ex- changes (by letter) about the poem and its conclusion. She wrote on August 29, I like the new song ever so much-It certainly doesn't need any more words and it seems to me you have got just what I tried to put into [them].... I think that you are right about the climax of that verse being in the last line-it is-but I thought it wasn't properly led up to-&amp; I still think the verse would be better with another line that would contrast more strongly the happiness of the things that had heard the spring &amp; the longing expectancy of that which hadn't. But I don't want to change anything as you have it in the tune-I haven't half said how much I like it. A week later, Harmony to Charles: "I'm glad you agreed abt that other line being necessary to a proper contrast." The poem, as it finally was printed in 114 Songs (no. 65)-with ultimate agreement between the two that "spring" is female and must be referred to, in the last line, not as "it" but "her"-might be laid out this way: Across the hill, of late, came spring And stopped and looked into this wood, and called and called and called.</page><page sequence="13">38 Hitchcock Now all the dry brown things are answ'ring, With here a leaf and there a fair blown flow'r. I only heard her not, and wait, and wait. In mid-autumn of 1907 (letter of October 17), Harmony enthused to "Dear Charlie" about the season: "These days are so heavenly- I've always called this time of year the peace of God, to myself-the earth has done her year's work and seems to be resting and these days seem to be a smile of approval." And ten days later she had turned those thoughts into a draft of a poem: Earth rests. Her work is done And, ere the night of winter comes To close her tired eyes &amp; hush her summer's song, She looks up sweetly for the Sun to smile on her And radiantly, thro' all the Autumn's glow, he smiles And brings the Peace of God. "I wrote these lines down just as they came," she said, adding with appealing modesty, "Of course, now I have the idea in any shape I can put it into some other." Ives thought he could suggest "some oth- er"; a slightly later copy, in his hand, survives: Earth rests.-Her work is done. and ere the night of winter comes to close her tired eyes and hush her summer's song she turns her face up sweetly for the sun to smile upon and, radiantly, through all the autumn glow he smiles and brings the "Peace of God[.]" Still more polishing was to come (whether by Harmony or Charles is uncertain; probably both). The final version, as in Ives's fair ink score and as printed in 114 Songs (no. 60), invites this transcription: Earth rests! Her work is done, her fields lie bare, And ere the night of winter comes To hush her song and close her tired eyes,</page><page sequence="14">"A Grand and Glorious Noise!" 39 She turns her face for the sun to smile upon, And radiantly, radiantly, thro' Fall's bright glow, he smiles And brings the Peace of God! Occasionally, textual revisions by Ives in reprints of songs setting his own lyrics offer insights into changes in his general thinking. In the version in 19 Songs (1935) of "The Innate" (first printed in 1922 as no. 40 of 114 Songs), Ives altered his original free verse, making it philosophically less particularized, more universal, and theological- ly less exclusive, more transcendental. In the following text, the itali- cized passages are those of 114 Songs, those underlined their replace- ments in 19 Songs: Voices live in every finite being, In every Godless lifetime. Often undivined, near silence. Hear them! Hear them in you! in others! They sense truth deep in the Soul; in all life; They know the things true Christians Pilgrims stand for. Stand out! Come to Him without the things the world brings; Come to Him! As a child and as a poor man. Christians give all. Christians have all. He had all, He gave all, all. Ives's changes transform the text from being specifically Christian to one that is generically monotheistic: "Pilgrims," not "Christians," are enjoined to come to an unparticularized "Him [who] had all, [who] gave all." And the later version is newly tinged with transcendental- ist thought, with the voices "undivined" (!) but living "in every finite being"-voices that sense the "truth deep in all life," not just "in the Soul." Most of these last examples have hinted at the literary acuity of Charles Ives and the virtuosity with which he could bend, gloss, or recast poetry by others to express his own ideas. Let me turn to one of his most exquisite original lyrics, that of "Berceuse" (114 Songs, no. 93). Ives originally composed the music about 1900 as a version of the cradle song "Guten Abend, gut' Nacht," well known in Brahms's setting, which is titled "Wiegenlied" (as also is Ives's). A few years later Ives adapted his music to an English-language text of his own- still a lullaby, as the new title "Berceuse" makes clear, but owing noth- ing to the text of "Wiegenlied": O'er the mountain towards the west, As the children go to rest, Faintly comes a sound,</page><page sequence="15">40 Hitchcock A song of nature hovers round. 'Tis the beauty of the night; Sleep thee well till morning light. The moment described is that when "the children go to rest"-a sweet suggestion of twilight. Especially striking is the richness of natural phenomena-a mountain, a sound, nighttime beauty, dawn's early light. And especially evocative is the identification of that nighttime beauty with a sound, a "song of nature." This centering of the song on sound, I suggest, is quintessentially Ivesian, as is the elevation of sound itself to a height verging on the divine-but a transcendental, natural Divinity, not an anthropomorphic one. So far, in this consideration of Ives as lyricist, my attention has cen- tered on his attention to words and ideas; few of his manufactures or manipulations of those have seemed to be made for the sake of sound per se. But ultimately we find that lyric after lyric invented or borrowed by Ives, among his more than 180 songs, has to do with sounds-natural or manmade, pedestrian or otherworldly. More than half his songs evoke sounds, some of them the sounds of other songs. One striking example is "Thoreau" (discussed above), with its affec- tionate and admiring recollection of the "Sounds" in Walden; let me remind you of a few others: * The Side Show" (114 Songs, no. 134)-Ives glossing Pat Roon- ey's popular waltz song "Is That Mr. Riley?" of 1883 and (now quoting Ives's gloss) its "tune that accomp'nies the trotting-track bell"; * A Christmas Carol" (114 Songs, no. 100)-its text overmodestly categorized by Ives (in the "Index" of 114 Songs) as "tradition- al," whereas, in fact, it is a macaronic collage of English, French, and Latin that he patched together, in which we "Hear the An- gels singing:/Peace on earth, good will to men! Noel!/.../Ven- ite adoremus Dominum" (one might liken this textual pastiche to what Larry Starr, in analyzing Ives's music, has called its "union of diversities");28 * The New River" (114 Songs, no. 6)-Ives angrily snarling at noise pollution (among other kinds): "Down the river comes a noise!/ .../It's only the sounds of man:/Phonographs and gasoline,/ Dancing halls and tambourine./..."; * Walking" (114 Songs, no. 67)-the moment: "A big October morning"; the sounds: "the village churchbells/.../Now hark! something bids us pause:/(down the valley, a church-a funer- al going on)/(up the valley, a roadhouse-a dance going on)"; * And of course "The Circus Band" (114 Songs, no. 56)-the band sparking and undergirding Ives's riot of recollections of the an-</page><page sequence="16">"A Grand and Glorious Noise!" 41 nual "big circus joys" of childhood; the sound of the band, its "grand and glorious noise": [1] All summer long, we boys [2] dreamed 'bout big circus joys! [3] Down Main Street comes the band, [4] Oh, "Ain't it a grand [5] and glorious noise!" [6] Horses are prancing, [7] Knights advancing; [8] Helmets gleaming, [9] Pennants streaming; [10] Cleopatra's on her throne! [11] That golden hair is all her own! [12] Where is the lady all in pink? [13] Last year she waved to me, I think. [14] Can she have died? Can! that! rot! [15] She is passing but she sees me not!29 [emphasis added] Ives was intoxicated with sounds-as is any composer worth the name. So, in this brief glimpse of Ives as lyricist, we come around to him as composer, with song and sound as vehicle of "the composer's voice." We have perhaps also come to realize that attention to Ives's lyrics adds a new dimension to our understanding of him as intel- lectual and artist, revealing him as an original wordsmith of unique sensibilities, intelligence, invention, wit, and grace-revealing also the subtlety of his uses of others' poetry, in highly personal and often unusual ways but, always, as a lyricist who "speaks with his own voice." NOTES This article is adapted from a paper read at the 1996 annual meeting, in Falls Church, Virginia, of the Sonneck Society for American Music. I am grateful, for their reactions to early versions, to J. Peter Burkholder, Edward T. Cone, Denise Von Glahn Cooney, Janet Cox-Rearick, Jonathan Elkus, Susan Tyler Hitchcock, Siegmund Levarie, Carol Oja, Wayne D. Shirley, Maynard Solomon, and Mark Tucker. The article reflects pre- liminary work toward a larger study of Ives as author; I limit myself here to consider- ation of Ives's solo song lyrics, resisting discussion of the texts in his other vocal genres or his prose writings. 1. The following take into account, to one degree or another, the lyrics of Ives's songs, although only Burkholder delves (occasionally) into them critically: Philip Ed- ward Newman, "The Songs of Charles Ives" (Ph.D. diss., University of Iowa, 1967); Nachum Schoffman, "The Songs of Charles Ives" (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University of</page><page sequence="17">42 Hitchcock Jerusalem, 1977); J. Peter Burkholder, Charles Ives: The Ideas Behind the Music (New Ha- ven: Yale University Press, 1985); Stuart Feder, Charles Ives/His Father's Song: A Psycho- analytic Biography (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992); Larry Starr, A Union of Diversities: Style in the Music of Charles Ives (New York: Schirmer Books, 1992); and Burkholder, All Made of Tunes: Charles Ives and the Uses of Musical Borrowing (New Ha- ven: Yale University Press, 1995). 2. 114 Songs was engraved and printed without copyright as a work for hire by G. Schirmer, Inc.; it was reprinted in 1975, unaltered except for addition of notices of copy- rights acquired in the interim by Peer International Corporation, Merion Music, Inc., As- sociated Music Publishers, Inc., and, for Ives's two postfaces (explanatory notes and es- say), the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Cowell published two collections of songs by Ives as issues of New Music: Thirty-Four Songs 7, no. 1 (Oct. 1933), repr. Bryn Mawr, Pa.: Merion Music, Inc. (Theodore Presser Co.), n.d.; and Eighteen [recte Nineteen] Songs 9, no. 1 (Oct. 1935), repr. Bryn Mawr, Pa.: Merion Music, Inc. (Theodore Presser Co.), n.d. Nearing completion is my critical edition of 129 Songs (114 Songs plus 15 others)-all of Ives's solo songs except those already published in critical editions by the late John Kirkpatrick (Eleven Songs and Two Harmonizations, Sunrise, and Forty Earlier Songs). 3. These were not identified specifically as such by Ives: in the first postface of 114 Songs, he wrote, with both generosity and modesty, "Where no author is indicated the words are by Harmony Twichell Ives or her husband." The eight by his wife (but largely predating the marriage) have been identified mainly through correspondence between the couple; they include (in 114 Songs) nos. 57 ("Mists"), 60 ("Autumn"), 65 ("Spring Song"), 90 ("The World's Highway"), 104 ("Two Little Flowers"), 112 ("To Edith"); and the English texts of nos. 68 ("Over all the treetops," translating Goethe's "Ilmenau") and 97 ("The South Wind," an alternate text for Heine's "Die Lotosblume"). 4.

The title is Beach's; she got the verses from a larger work, "Rose et Noir," in Fabbri's Lyrics (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1892), according to Steven Ledbetter, liner notes for Amy Beach: Dark Garden (Northeastern Records NR 9004-CD, rel. 1988). The tenor Paul Sperry, who edited a volume of such American art songs (see note 12), recorded many of them as Songs of an Innocent Age (Albany Records Troy 034-2, rel. 1990). In his liner notes, Sperry writes, "The lyrics of a huge percentage of the repertory consti- tute an embarrassment of mediocrity or worse.... Occasionally... the poems are so bad and the settings so appropriate that the songs become hugely entertaining." 8.

See Feder, Charles Ives, particularly chap. 21 ("Autobiographies I, 1920-22"), in which he refers to 114 Songs as an "arcane and accidental autobiography... its intri- cate and subtle revelations [constituting] Charles Ives's truest 'life.'"</page><page sequence="18">"A Grand and Glorious Noise!" 43 12.

These are twelve miniatures, settings of commonplace ep- igrams; briefest is the six-second "Answer the First Rap" ("Opportunity may knock often, but it's better to answer the first rap!"). Sperry's recording of all twelve (see note 7) takes less than three minutes. 13. First published in Thirty-Four Songs, 50 (no. 16 of the reprint). 14. First published in Nineteen Songs, 44-47. I owe the identification of Ives's ulti- mate source of "Soliloquy" (and of this verse) in Emerson-a passage near the end of "Plato; or, the Philosopher" in Representative Men-to Wayne D. Shirley (letter of June 26, 1990). Ives did not acknowledge this debt; he was unconsciously echoing (not ac- tually quoting) Emerson. When he did quote consciously, Ives was punctilious in ac- knowledging his text sources, and equally so in seeking permission to use any text protected by copyright-and not using a copyrighted text without the permission. One example is "Grantchester," setting a text by Rupert Brooke published in 1912. In the first printing of 114 Songs, bound in light green, the three pages intended for this song (no. 17) were left blank. Ives had written to G. Schirmer, "On account of a technical point of copyright ... the song 'Grantchester'-Rupert Brooke #17 will have to be taken out, at least of the copies we send out this year" (Yale University, School of Music, Charles Ives Archive [MSS 14] IIIB, Box 35/11). 15. Stuart Feder paraphrased the last line as a subtitle of his "psychoanalytic biog- raphy" (see note 1), centered on the theme of what he calls the "posthumous collabo- ration" between composer Charles and his father George. The lines from Wordsworth are the last two in "The Solitary Reaper." 16. "In an age of fops and toys," Poems by Ralph Waldo Emerson (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Co., 1904), 9:207; Ives uses lines 13-16 (the last four). 17. David Michael Hertz, Angels of Reality: Emersonian Unfolding in Wright, Stevens, and Ives (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1993), 102, puts it this way: "The poem should be read in the context of the antislavery views shared by Ives' fa- ther and Emerson and passed on to the modern transcendentalist composer." The first movement of Ives's Orchestral Set no. 1 (Three Places in New England) is "The 'St. Gaud- ens' in Boston Common (Col. Shaw and His Colored Regiment)"; his Study no. 9 for piano is The Anti-Abolitionist Riots in the 1830's and 1840's. 18. Well-known examples are "General William Booth Enters into Heaven" (Nine- teen Songs, no. [1]) to the poem by Vachel Lindsay (1879-1931), known to Ives (initial- ly, at least) through a partial reprint in The Independent for Jan. 12, 1914; and "The Great- est Man" (114 Songs, no. 19), to a poem by Anne Timoney Collins printed in the New York Evening Sun, June 7, 1921. One wishes that Ives had set something by his slightly younger contemporary, the poet Wallace Stevens (1879-1955)-like Ives an Ivy League graduate (Harvard) and an insurance executive (Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company)-but Stevens began publishing poetry only in 1923, when Ives was essen- tially finished as a songwriter. (On aesthetic parallels between the two, however, es- pecially in relation to Emerson, see Hertz, Angels of Reality.) 19. This and the following quotation from Walden are from The Portable Thoreau, rev. ed. by Carl Bode (New York: Viking Penguin, Inc., 1964; repr. 1982 [with new bibliog- raphy]), 374. 20. "Ode, Pronounced at the Centennial Celebration of the Settlement of Boston, September, 1830," Writings of Charles Sprague, now first collected (New York: Charles S. Francis, 1841), 44-63. Of Sprague's 30 stanzas, Ives uses no. 19 (p. 55 in the publica- tion cited here). 21. Included in Hunt's essay "Rhyme and Reason," The Liberal: Verse and Prose from the South (London: John Hunt, 1822), 1:81-82. The poem also appears in the essay "By- ron, Moore, and Hunt," repr. in Lawrence H. Houtchens and Carolyn W. Houtchens,</page><page sequence="19">44 Hitchcock ed., Leigh Hunt's Literary Criticism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1955), 333- 34. Ives does not title his song (except, as given here, in the "Index" of 114 Songs) but precedes the score with the following preface (here lightly edited to correct obvious errors and, in the quotations from Hunt, to be more faithful to his text): Leigh Hunt, in his essay "Rhyme and Reason," says: "... Yet how many 'poems' there are ... of which we require no more than the rhymes, to be acquainted with the whole of them? You know what the rogues have done by the ends they come to. For instance, what is more necessary to inform us of all which the following gentleman has for sale, than the bell he tinkles at the end of his cry? We are as sure of him as the muffin-man." Then he quotes the beautiful text found in the song below. It is called a 'Love Song,' but this is not enough: when attached to music, it becomes a "Morceau de Coeur," a "Romanzo di Central Park," or an "In- termezzo Table d'h6te." 22. On the pencil sketch for the fourth movement of his Set #1 (1909), which he ar- ranged as the song perhaps in 1920, Ives wrote in a margin, "HTI in Hospital Sally singing 70 W 11 April 29-'09"-a reference to the hospitalization of Harmony Twichell Ives from April 20 to May 15, 1909, when, as yet childless, she had a hyster- ectomy. 23. As stated by John Kirkpatrick in Ives, Eleven Songs and Two Harmonizations (New York: Associated Music Publishers, 1968), iii. 24. Ives's treatment of another single stanza of a well-known hymn is even more provocative. This is "Watchman" by John Bowring (1792-1872), known best in its set- ting by Lowell Mason, and both borrowed by Ives in his own "Watchman" (114 Songs, no. 44; derived from the first movement of his Symphony no. 4). He transforms Bow- ring's first stanza-a simple, straightforward dialogue between a Traveler and a Watch- man, beginning "Watchman, tell us of the night,/What its signs of promise are"-into something far less matter-of-fact. Indeed, his manipulations charge the verses with ambiguity and mystery (both qualities also true of his musical setting and its modifi- cations of Mason's tune). 25. Burkholder, All Made of Tunes, 150. 26. Yale University, Music Library, Charles Ives Archive, uncatalogued box, folder marked "HT to CEI 1906-May 1908." On the other side of the leaf is an unpublished Christmastide lyric, also by her, beginning "Sweet music of the Christmastide/My heart can hear it still" (not set by Ives). Other manuscript material by Harmony Twichell cited below derives from the same source folder, unless otherwise stated. 27. The source and date of her dispatch are identified in John Kirkpatrick's Appen- dix 19 ("Harmony Twichell [1876-1969]") to Ives, Memos (New York: W. W. Norton, 1972), 277. Quotations about this poem from her letters are as transcribed by Kirkpatrick and filed in Yale University, Music Library, Charles Ives Archive, folder marked "Ad- ditional Ives Letters, mostly 1907-1908." 28. Starr, A Union of Diversities. 29. Irving Berlin conveyed the same sort of excitement over bands in several songs- not only in "Alexander's Ragtime Band" of 1911 but earlier ("That Kazzatsky Dance," 1910) and later ("A Little Bit of Everything" and "Lead Me to That Beautiful Band," both 1912; and "Follow the Crowd," 1914). See Hamm, "Alexander and His Band," American Music 14, no. 1 (Spring 1996): 65-102. Since it is not known when Ives added to an untitled piano march of the mid-1890s the title and text of "The Circus Band" (no manuscript source of the song version survives), whether his lyric was influenced by Berlin is similarly unknown.</page></plain_text>
