<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism: In Strange Way K E N N E TH  G RO S S University of Rochester In 1601, John Donne composed a satirical allegory titled The Progresse of the Soule, or Metempsychosis. Written in stanzas pointedly mirroring those of  Spenser’s Faerie Queene—nine pentameter lines and final hex- ameter, with a less interwoven, more abrupt rhyme-scheme than Spen- ser’s, aabccbbddd—this dense, apparently unfinished text of  520 lines recounts the successive transmigrations of  a nameless but deathless soul through a variety of  human and animal forms. The soul in Me- tempsychosis is a peculiar entity, a spirit of  innovation, heresy, usurpa- tion, and perverse appetite; it has a life at once human and inhuman, natural and historical. Abject, repugnant, inchoate, isolated, the soul holds a hard sort of  charm. And its homes are myriad. They include, by turns, the tree of  knowledge in the Garden of  Eden (which later, Donne adds in line with medieval legend, provided the wood for the Cross); an anthropomorphic mandrake root, whose extract can serve as both a poison and an aphrodisiac, and also as something to induce abortions; a lustful, self-wasting sparrow; several hapless fishes; a pon- derous and tyrannical whale, himself  slain by a conspiracy of  two other fish; a Machiavellian mouse, who crawls into the brain of  an elephant to kill him, and is destroyed at the same time; a wolf  and a wolf-dog (the latter the wolf ’s own child, a creature that at once guards and de- vours sheep); a rapine ape; a vice-ridden woman, the wife of  Cain; and finally the flesh of  heretics like Mohammed and Martin Luther. Donne tells us that this soul lived “where every great change did come” (line 69), that it is something which both “did teare, / And mend the wracks of  th’Empire” (lines 67–68), a principle of  order and disorder both, or of order emerging out of disorder.1 For all its relentless powers 1.

Empowered and at risk, Donne’s nameless soul sticks within creatures that are both devoured and devouring; it becomes a prey both to its own desires and to the desires of  others. This soul is a thing for which all contacts with the world seem half-conscious, violent, and usually mortal, a center of  un- settling will and responsiveness whose attempts at fulfilling its desires serve mainly to put it at the mercy of  other powers and chances. Strangely, there seems to be no other entity like it in the world. Deathless or continuous the soul is, in a nominal fashion, as befits the poem’s adaptation of  Pythagoras’s vision of  metempsychosis in book 15 of  Ovid’s Metamorphoses. But we gather only a very volatile, ab- stracted notion of  a self  or personality from within its endless cycle of changes. This soul remembers nothing of itself, neither does the world, nor can it make anything of  its deaths—a sacrifice or martyrdom, say. Moreover, this soul’s continual, unsettling rebirths leave as little room for hope, reparation, blessing, or transcendence as its endless deaths do for mourning. Donne suggests obscurely at one point that the soul at present in- habits the mortal body of  the aging Queen Elizabeth, as if  it hovered close to the center of  the political and spiritual order of  England (though almost by accident). Even more strongly does he suggest that the soul finds its current home in the solitary author himself; it be- comes an image of  that “lively spright” that inhabits his poetry, a power that guarantees his survival in time, and that, he hopes, can “make my darke heavy Poem light, and light” (line 55). Indeed the poet asks us to see, projected within this grotesque piece of  myth- making, the image of  a poetic source or cause, some anonymous, se- cret knot of  invention or responsiveness, that can sustain itself  through such a changing array of  emblematic identities, and thread together its odd assembly of  masks—as if  Donne would identify simultaneously with all of  the creatures, human and inhuman, this strange soul catches and is caught by, even as it remains distinct. Metempsychosis demands greater attention as a whole poem than I can give it here. If  there were space, I would say more about this work’s Rabelaisian wit, its wildly diffused violence, its feeling for the aberrant, endlessly surprising shapes of  physical life, and its way of intertwining both ordinary and historically fraught moments of  tem- poral crisis. I would explore more fully the decidedly heterodox, even Gnostic cosmology Donne improvises in the poem, his intertwining of  Ovidian and Spenserian ideas of  change. (You could indeed think </page> <page sequence="3"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 373 of  this poem—subtitled Infinitati Sacrum, sacred to infinity—as Donne’s ironic homage to the author of  the Garden of  Adonis and the Muta- bilitie Cantos, a poet who sought to absorb the violences of  time within a myth of  dynamic change, a vision of  mortal things kept “eterne in mutability”—a vision that Donne’s poem tries to deconstruct, or from which he exacts a more disturbing vitality.2) In the context of  this essay, however, I invoke Metempsychosis to do a more pointed sort of critical work. Donne’s account of  this soul interests me because it provides a powerful opening analogy for the larger subject in this essay, that is, the spirit that animates the difficult texts of  the Songs and Sonnets. The life of  Donne’s soul reminds us of  the volatile gestural and con- ceptual drive of  these poems—in their confrontations with change and contingency, in their ruthless toying with the language of  magic, heresy, or sedition, in their complex shifts of  partisanship (political, theological, erotic), in their movements between affection and aggres- sion, hope and paranoia, between a remarkable sense of  freedom and a sense of  constraint, between a will to mastery and a chilling aware- ness of  failure. That soul gives us an image of  something that could tie together the often violently shifting passages from stanza to stanza in these lyrics, where the end of  a poem seems often to forget its beginning. The analogy is imperfect, of  course. For one thing, the violences and ironies of  the lyric poems are subtler than those of Metempsychosis. The world into which Donne’s “spirit” is thrown in the Songs and Sonnets is just as fraught with dangers, but there is more of a desire to find a form for the poem or a voice that makes a real stay against change, loss, and entrapment. The soul in Metempsychosis is eerily passive, whereas the lyric poems stage a restless work of  making. 2. John Carey, John Donne: Life, Mind and Art (New York: Oxford University Press, 1980), pp. 148–58, brings out well the large (and largely heterodox) ambitions of  this neglected poem, as does Janel M. Mueller in her remarkable essay “Donne’s Epic Ven- ture in the Metempsychosis,” Modern Philology 70 (1972): 109–37. Neither critic really ex- plores the poem’s ironic response to Spenser’s vision of  ordered change in The Faerie Queene, something that Donne’s stanza form, among other things, makes very plain. One habitually thinks of  Donne as the most un-Spenserian of  writers, yet this satirical work engages with Spenser as sharply and subtly as Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus (ca. 1592) wres- tles with book 1 of  The Faerie Queene, or as Shakespeare’s Venus and Adonis (1593) trans- forms the central mythos of  book 3. It would be gratifying to find evidence that Donne, before composing Metempsychosis in or around 1601, had seen the manuscript of  the Two Cantos of Mutabilitie, which was not published until 1609 but which must have been somewhere available in London after Spenser’s return to the city (and subsequent death) in 1599. Still, the cosmogonic vision of  birth and rebirth unfolded in the Garden of  Ado- nis, which Donne could have read as early as 1590, provides a sufficient point of  depar- ture for his parody. </page> <page sequence="4"> 374 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y Also in the lyrics, the self ’s survival in the secular world is no longer an automatic certainty, becoming instead the object of  more troubled speculation. “Contingency” itself  takes on rather plainer, if  no less in- tractable forms in Donne’s love poems: in place of  devouring beasts, great wars, or cosmic accidents, the self  or spirit is threatened by the morning sun whose light breaks unavoidably through a window; by a woman who enters a room as one wakes from a dream; by a lover who squashes a flea or who refuses to speak. The threat, indeed, may come from the simple consciousness that there is a world outside one- self, that there are other persons who may know or judge or misjudge a person, who may ignore one’s needs and demands, or to whom one is bound without apparent reason or choice. We get the sense of  a mind always dangerously susceptible to what Donne, in “Good Fri- day, 1613, Riding Westward,” calls “forraigne motions” (line 4), alien gravitations that can warp it from its desired orbit.3 The poems un- fold a lyric drama of  the self  pitched mortally against sources of  doubt both internal and external, and without even the nominal fantasy of continuous life such as we find in Metempsychosis.4 3. See John Donne, The Divine Poems, ed. Helen Gardner (Oxford University Press, 1978), p. 30. 4. Carey, pp. 231–60, offers a useful account of  the broad sources of  Donne’s skep- tical temper. He sees this as reflecting a complex distrust of  human reason, especially of  scholastic philosophy, that manifests itself  diversely in thinkers such as John Calvin, Michel de Montaigne, and Francis Bacon. It is a distrust heightened for Donne by a sense of  the cruel and delusory purposes to which such reason may be put, and a pow- erful sense of  how much reason costs us in terms of  both human lives and human con- sciences—even if  opposing appeals to nature, grace, or the motions of  the spirit have terrors of  their own. I do share some of  William Empson’s distaste for Carey’s cynical tonality, his sense of  moral melodrama, his relentless wish to sound, as Empson puts it, “bluff  and manly” in laying bare Donne’s religious guilt, bad faith, self-loathing, and sexual contempt, rather than seeing in his conflicted writings evidence of  Donne’s risky largeness of  mind, his exploration of  new worlds of  love and loss. (See Empson, “There Is No Penance Due to Innocence,” a review of  Carey’s book, in New York Review of Books [December 3, 1981], pp. 42–50.) Taken as a whole, though, Carey’s book is wonderfully alert to the skeptical drama of  the love lyrics, their explorings of  the variety, plasticity, and limitations of  human thought, their investments in scholastic paradoxes or sacred tropes to which yet much doubt and even guilt may be attached. This critic catches the sense of  isolation and the wrestling with real and imaginative death that drives the poetry. Also helpful on Donne’s skepticism, if  more schematic, is James Baumlin, John Donne and the Rhetorics of Renaissance Discourse (Columbia: University of  Missouri Press, 1991), especially his pages on “skepticism and sophism” (pp. 230–62), which describe the struggle in Donne’s poetry between a radical doubt that would empty out all trust in the powers of  human thought, reason, or faith, and a “sophistic” trust in language’s magical, ravishing power to create alternative realities. That conflict shapes Donne’s de- ployments of  what Baumlin identifies as the two other opposed “discourses” at work in </page> <page sequence="5"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 375 * * * Let me begin by sketching in very general terms what I take to be the typical movement of  Donne’s early lyrics, their inner drama of  trope, voice, and gesture, their composition of  opposing perspectives. Rough and abstract as my description may be, it gives me a starting point for the readings of  individual poems that I will attempt in this essay. Typ- ically, the poems of  Songs and Sonnets begin by making us conscious of  a background situation of  threat or danger; they open strikingly, with some awareness of  intrusion, blockage, or loss that sets at risk a present or wished-for state of  possession or unity (usually but not ex- clusively erotic). The threat to that wish is often located in the world outside—“For Godsake hold your tongue, and let me love” (“The Can- onization,” line 1), “Busie old foole, unruly sunne” (“The Sunne Ris- ing,” line 1).5 The speaker confronts some judgmental, accusatory, or slanderous agency beyond his control, or else faces some more im- personal power of  chance and change—even though one often gets a sense that the danger reflects equally the poet’s doubt of  his own powers, and the very conflicted shape of  his own desire. The sense of threat is, in any case, overdetermined. The crucial point is that the poem itself, the unfolding sequence of  speculations, fictions, argu- ments, challenges, prayers, analogies, and hyperboles emerges out of the speaker’s desire to master the situation of  threat purely by his words. He deploys his lyric tropes to answer the intrusion, to shape some figure of  reparation or possession that might control or ratio- nalize the threat. This struggle for mastery is at once emotional, con- ceptual, and metaphysical. And there are two things to add to this. First, the attempt at mastery is liable, in any given poem, to fail or show an inescapable flaw. Whether directly or indirectly, some shadow of the initial menace will remain, or some new threat will suddenly arise to take its place. Second, each failure begets additional and often more desperate attempts at mastery; each produces further sequences of the poetry, the incarnational and the transcendental. Baumlin understands these texts as more than just “self-consuming artifacts”; his reading of  “Valediction: Of  my name in the Window” (pp. 176–84), for example, does a fine job of  showing the speaker’s volatile but unflappable desire to redefine the power of  that name. Still, his distanced, post-structuralist focus on Donne’s way of  moving among competing “discourses” keeps Baumlin from weighing the sorts of  questions Arnold Stein poses in regard to the poems’ attempts to find some sort of  resolution to their conflicts, however tenta- tive. On Stein, see n. 6 below. 5. All quotations from Donne’s love lyrics are from John Donne, The Elegies and Songs and Sonnets, ed.

One way of  put- ting this is that the poems continually generate figures of  mastery in which the reality principle and the pleasure principle seek satisfaction at the same moment.6 A fairly simple example of  this dynamic can be found in “Valedic- tion: Of  my name in the Window.” This poem is a kind of  extended farewell to a beloved (an au revoir, one may think at first, rather than a Cavalier-like adieu or a more elegaic leave-taking, though all these possibilities haunt the poem).7 It unfolds as a sequence of  anxiously compelled re-imaginings of  a slight marking of  the poet’s identity—his name inscribed on a window in his lover’s chamber, a signature writ- ten in the face of  separation and (as it turns out) a growing suspicion of  the lover’s potential for infidelity. The poem is quite literally a test- ing of  name magic. Donne insists first that his name will be a charm to make the window as hard as the diamond that engraved it, and thus an emblem of  his faith; the glass will likewise stand as an emblem of his sincerity and candor, and moreover offer a place where his love may glimpse her own reflection overlaying his in unity. In the next stanza, the scratched name becomes a “pattern” that will teach the beloved herself  fidelity. But soon, as if  the need for such a pattern conjured the spectre of  her inevitable infidelity, he sees the name no longer as a “hard and deepe” lesson in erotic constancy but rather as a “ragged bony” thing, even his “ruinous Anatomie,” a reminder only of  the death of  love and lovers (lines 19–24). But yet again, as if  this were too desperate and self-pitying an interpretation, Donne further re-reads the name as a charmed body that his lover will keep until 6. In trying to refine this story and its implications, I have been especially drawn to Arnold Stein’s great study, John Donne’s Lyrics: The Eloquence of Action (Minneapolis: Uni- versity of  Minnesota Press, 1962). Stein stresses the protean energy of  Donne’s poems: there is “no given tone, no stable attitude or defined position from which he can follow a clear development . . . things appear to be in violent motion” (p. 66). Stein also insists on Donne’s heroic generosity of  vision, his way of  holding his consciousness open to “destructive worlds within and without” (p. 79), testing the boundaries between, say, the erotic and the theological. For Stein, Donne seeks poetic forms in which he can acknowl- edge his conceptual difficulties, which unfold “a sequence of  awakening and disenchant- ment” (p. 72), forms able to contain a revised consciousness in which conflicts are not triumphally annihilated or denied but rather exposed and assimilated. My deepest debt in this essay, however, is to William Empson’s writings on Donne’s poetry, includ- ing Seven Types of Ambiguity, rev. ed. (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1949), pp. 139–47, and the various pieces collected in Essays on Renaissance Literature, vol. 1, Donne and the New Philosophy, ed. John Haffenden (Cambridge University Press, 1993), especially his sublime account of  Donne’s skeptical, exploratory poetics, “Donne the space man” (pp. 78–128). 7.

It becomes after this a magical inscription or talisman set to hold the influence of  the stars called “love” and “griefe”: So since this name was cut When love and griefe their exaltation had, No doore ’gainst this names influence shut; As much more loving, as more sad, ’Twill make thee; and thou shouldst, till I returne, Since I die daily, daily mourne. (Lines 37–42) In the next stanza the beloved is invited to “thinke this name alive”— in spite of  the speaker’s daily death—and now possessed of  the strength to fight for her love against the intrusions of  a new lover who opens the window and corrupts her heart. Subsequently, as if  in response to the fright of  this recognition, the scratched name decays into a kind of  ghost that will hide the speaker’s name in her memory, or if  noth- ing else, “flow / Into thy fancy” (lines 57–58), causing the woman un- consciously to inscribe the speaker’s name (which we are never told) on the letter she is writing to his rival. As if  he had reached the point of exhaustion with his conceit-making, the poet ends—bitterly, if  weakly, or with bitter weakness—by giving up the game, confessing that, after all, “glasse, and lines must bee, / No meanes our firme substantiall love to keepe” (lines 61–62), asking her to take the whole of  what we’ve just read as the mad, idle talk of  a dying man. The conventional if  overdetermined silence of  the beloved in a typ- ical Petrarchan love poem is here given a curious, ironic kind of  sub- stance, made pregnant as it were. (As William Empson notes, Donne always offers the women in his love poetry an equal if  still potentially dangerous power.8) It is exactly the beloved’s lack of  response that becomes the background against which the speaker’s fears emerge. One of  course has the feeling that the speaker himself  conjures up the very threats that his surmises try to master, at some moments giving those threats a wild or spectral shape, at others all too concrete a form. The delicacy of  the poem’s comedy comes from the very uncer- tainty of  the disenchanting “reality” that his conceit-making is fend- ing off; that reality, half-acknowledged as the product of  his own fear, is thus continually under revision, glimpsed at best retrospectively by reference to the fantastic images which seek to banish it. We get a slightly different version of  this variously opportunistic and defensive mode in the ritualized seduction game of  “The Flea.” This poem begins with the speaker insisting to his lover that the flea 8. Empson, “There is No Penance,” p. 42. </page> <page sequence="8"> 378 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y he has found on her body is an argument for the sinlessness of  her yielding to his physical desires: “Marke but this flea, and marke in this / How little that which thou deny’st me is” (lines 1–2). Given that the bug has sucked first his blood and then hers, and mingled that blood within its tiny body, doing neither of  them any harm, there is no reason for her to resist his demands. (The lack of  any scandal or disgust at the discovery of  this insect and the quick turn to playful casuistry makes the scene feel by turns intimate and strangely self- dramatizing, as if  all distance and scale were out of  measure, entirely negotiable.) In the second stanza, however, something changes. It be- gins with the speaker calling to his beloved to stay her hand, which had apparently—in the space between the stanzas—made a movement to kill the flea. In the face of  this threat, the speaker is now suddenly propelled beyond his earlier, quaintly materialized argument for the innocence of  sexual love, arguing that indeed the two of  them “al- most, nay more than maryed are” (line 11) in the flea she wants to kill. The speaker converts the insect’s black body into “living walls of Jet” (line 15), indeed into a marriage temple, an embowered refuge for their love, something set beyond the grudging hand of  both par- ents and, more to the point, of  the beloved herself, who had earlier tried to kill it: “though parents grudge, and you” (line 14). The flea thus becomes not so much a viable means of  persuading her to yield as a kind of  pre-emptive, fetishistic substitute for what he is being de- nied. Seeking further to save the flea, and with it his love and will, the speaker makes the creature into a weird vessel of  “three lives” whose murder will thus constitute both a suicide and a sacrilege. The third stanza tells us again of  something that happens between the stanzas: the woman, turned “cruell and sodaine,” has killed the flea, “purpled thy naile, in blood of  innocence” (lines 19–20). It is the killing of  his innocent metaphor that the speaker is partly upset about, of  course, though “innocence” is always an ambiguous quantity in Donne’s love poems. But he quickly recoups his losses by turning against the whole prior architecture of  persuasion. If  the beloved has triumphantly defeated arguments by showing that the death of  the flea has cost neither of  them any life at all, this can only demonstrate how little her giving herself  to him will cost; “Just so much honor, when thou yeeld’st to mee, / Will wast, as this flea’s death tooke life from thee” (lines 26–27). Part of  the lure of  Donne’s lyrics is in how they invite us into the courtly game, with its uneasy struggle for rhetorical and erotic mas- tery, and its endless adjustments of  intimacy. We need to weigh the play and the process of  such arguments. I have said that these poems show us the speaker’s recurrent failures of  persuasion in the face of </page> <page sequence="9"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 379 intractable silence, opposition, or fear of  betrayal, and their recur- rent attempts to answer this failure by more and more elaborate con- ceits. But given that the gestures of  persuasion are so consciously extravagant, grotesque, and quasi-magical, it’s often hard to see how they could have succeeded at all, what success would have looked like. We hence don’t even know what the failures of  persuasion themselves mean, what the failure is emblematic of. We don’t, I think, get that sense of  a self  being increasingly sickened by failure, or being forced to go painfully back over a failed or compromised conceit, such as we feel in many of  Shakespeare’s sonnets. Even when the comedy of  the situation is clear, as in “Valediction: Of  my name in the Window” or “The Flea,” it is hard to keep one’s footing as one reads, since it is hard to know the stakes of  the game, the weight of  investment behind each successive figure. So many of  Donne’s images, after all, carry an interest in excess of  their apparent use or occasion in the poem. For one thing, we are always made aware of  the diverse array of  infantile, coercive, or violent motives that can drive the brilliant pseudo-logic and transcendental analogizing. For another, there are the multiple modes of  logic that drive the persuasion, by turns legal, philosophi- cal, magical, and theological; the poems can with such fluency appro- priate, transmute, and mock so many heterogeneous spheres of  value, meaning, and experience that it is hard to see the links between them, or to know upon whom or what the satirical tonalities fall. Yet there is always something driving the poems, erotic and intellectual at once, that helps in “the electro-magnetizing of  whole fields of  ex- perience in their subtle details,” as Theodore Redpath observes.9 One thing we can say, however, is that Donne’s speakers, even in the face of  multiple failures of  persuasion, are at least always trying to keep control of  their own unstable rhetoric, trying to persuade them- selves that they have control over, if  nothing else, their own words. They keep afloat through their continuous powers of  invention. Yet even given this, the poems never collapse into solipsistic whirls of  bril- liant verbiage, since the speakers never cease to set their speech and fantasy at risk before the objects of  their desire. If  one of  Donne’s speakers manages, against all apparent odds, to keep on talking, his eloquence sustains itself  at the cost of  successively more extreme, self- mocking, and transparently defensive gestures, at the cost of  creating a poetic structure where, as in “Valediction: Of  my name in a Win- dow,” each successive argument cuts itself  off  from or obviates the pre- vious one, or where the speaker must abandon or distort the desire 9.

(New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1983), p. 13. </page> <page sequence="10"> 380 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y which moved him at the opening, anchoring that desire to alien words and images. The most powerful poems are ones in which the under- current of  disenchantment is matched by an equally powerful drive toward some more perfect or sublimated fulfillment. The ironic, embattled self-display of  the texts I have discussed so far takes on more fraught implications in a poem like “The Canoniza- tion.” This poem begins in a voice of  aggressive scorn, withdrawal, and paranoia: “For Godsake hold your tongue, and let me love” (line 1). The anger here is directed, one assumes, not at a beloved who keeps silent or kills fleas, but at some more menacing and authoritative voice of  accusation. One gets a sense that all external tongues are for the speaker intrusive, pre-emptive, judgmental, even slanderous. So Donne begins by commanding their silence. Or else, as if  aware that he can- not succeed in shutting them up, he begs that they direct their criti- cism away from his love affairs and onto his ruined fortune, his age, or his lost public reputation (for what we are not told). Or again, as if  slander and praise were all but convertible into one another, his mockers are told that they should instead lavish attention on more worthy idols, on money or place at court. “What you will, approve,” the poet says, “so you will let me love” (lines 8–9). What is remark- able is that by the end of  the poem these external voices, though not exiled or silenced, are radically and optimistically transformed. At the close, in a magnificent and eerily generous reversal, the rejected but inexcludable voices of  the outside world are invited back with a ven- geance. They are asked to speak for a world that not only approves but makes divinity of  the speaker’s love, makes of  it an ideal, world- encompassing thing, something to be invoked as a canonical pattern for all other lovers to follow. The object of  general contempt has be- come the object of  universal desire. That Donne is able to move be- tween these two equally willful and hyperbolic poles, however, only makes sense if  we see how, within the body of  the poem, Donne’s evolving fantasies of  escape are put under increasing pressure, forcing him to ever more suspect forms of  accommodation. At the end of  the first stanza, Donne continues to defend his love, arguing that the two of  them in their sealed sphere have done no one any harm, not drowned, burned, or infected anyone with the tears or fever. “Alas, alas, who’s injur’d by my love?” (line 10). But this argu- ment is itself  turned around in the subsequent strophe where, partly in response to his own rhetorical questions, Donne seeks an image to catch at and transform the idea that they have, at least, injured each other, done violence to each other, in their self-enclosed affection. This argument takes the form of  (still equivocal) predications that the speaker urgently offers to those persons who have slandered or mis- </page> <page sequence="11"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 381 judged him, as if  he would be spoken of  by them only in words he gave them: Call us what you will, wee’are made by such love; Call her one, mee another flye, We’are Tapers too, and at our owne cost die, And wee in us find the’Eagle and the Dove; The Phoenix riddle hath more wit By us, we two being one, are it, So, to one neutrall thing both sexes fit. Wee dye and rise the same, and prove Mysterious by this love. (Lines 19–27) That the speaker puns on the double meaning of  “dying” does not di- minish one’s sense that he here tries at once to confess and repudiate the idea that their love has cost them anything—for instance, a simple capacity to live peacefully in the world. The lines are stark in their assertion, resonant with a sense of  martyrdom, and yet the emphasis is on how the lovers “dye and rise the same,” a survival mysterious partly in its indifference to any idea or hope of  transcending mortal- ity, to rising not the same but differently. The speaker is trying, that is, to keep his invoked mystery grounded, modulated. But as if  even this domesticated miracle were itself  impossible to sustain, too shrill a protest against loss and threat despite its flatness, Donne in the next stanza seems ready to give up his figures of  magical rebirth: “Wee can dye by it, if  not live by love” (line 28, emphasis added). Things have altered here yet again; we get another curious intermingling of  dis- enchantment and fantasy. No longer made or re-made by his love, the speaker tries to hold onto a sense that he and his lover might at least “die” into the well-wrought shape of  sonnets or stanzas. By this point, it is as if  he had abandoned any fantasy of  his own or his beloved’s re- cuperation of  love in the present. It is indeed against the background of  this confessed loss or failure to live in love, now suddenly trans- formed into a less private martyrdom, that the poet is able in what follows to give up, or rather reverse, his opening paranoia in regard to the outside world. He imagines now his literal absence from the world, even as he invests the very public he had earlier attacked with a transfiguring power of  prayer, an ability to recreate the lovers as secular saints. It is the external others, not the poet, who now give voice to a hyperbolic figure of  the lovers’ isolated power of  survival. These others now belong to a future world which looks back at the lovers’ present with nostalgia, a future which assertively purifies their love of  the very rage that has yet, we feel, really moved the poem from beginning to end: </page> <page sequence="12"> 382 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y And thus invoke us; You whom reverend love Made one anothers hermitage; You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage; Who did the whole worlds soule contract, and drove Into the glasses of  your eyes, So made such mirrors, and such spies, That they did all to you epitomize, Countries, Townes, Courts: Beg from above A patterne of  your love! (Lines 37–45) The only spies are now the lovers themselves, lovers who are also the only idols, the only saints or relics of  everyone else’s quest. One feels the willfulness of  this, that tropes emerge out of  repres- sion or flight. It’s nevertheless not easy to measure what’s invested in the evasions. It only complicates the balance of  fascination and suspi- cion that Donne interweaves the aura of  a Popish religious practice with a description of  the lovers’ eyes as alchemical vessels that hold, by force of  mutual violence (Donne’s “drove” suggests no calm pro- cess of  distillation), the whole world’s soul within them. Distinct if still mirroring realms of  longing and doubt are thrust together here. The eyes then become glasses of  a different sort, mirrors, and yet still spies. (One wants to ask, what do the mirrors reflect? And do the “spies” look inward or outward?) Should we try to ask, rationalisti- cally, how intelligible or persuasive such a figure of  mystery is, what it tells us about what Donne believes? Empson shows the right tact, I think, when he says that for Donne the idea of  such mystical union, transfiguration, and transcendence was “always a tight-rope walk, a challenge to skill and courage, and after all it never pretended to offer any hope, only an assurance that those who called him wrong were themselves wrong”—wrong, that is, in binding him down to con- ventional standards and the rules of  religious orthodoxy (all of  whose mysteries are not only institutionalized but, Empson reminds us, made the grounds for persecuting others).10 An ending such as we find in “The Canonization” works because it offers the speaker a stay against his own doubts; it offers, if  not clear hope, then a realized vehicle for his hopeless desires, a formal gesture in which he can witness and acknowledge their fragility, even as he brings them within the orbit of other fantasies and myths, perhaps equally questionable. Arnold Stein is accurate in his sense of  the poem’s subtle, ferocious engagement with the shifting demands of  both the internal and the external world; the poet begins with a deeply felt, ascetic withdrawal from the world’s 10.

It is a progress that works to evade (in a quite startling fashion, if  one thinks about it) the blunt demand for the most ordinary work of  mourning, for sighs and tears, for all these imply about our life in time, and yet to do this without the speaker’s denying the weight, the fraught bond, of  his and his lady’s love. Recall the famous sequence of urgings in the stanzas: the wish that their separation should be quiet, like the death of  virtuous men; that so sacred a love or loss should not be announced to profane persons by any noise; that to confirm their love’s cosmic scope, its trepidations must be silent like those of the invisible spheres; that their love is, after all, really a matter of  in- teranimated minds that have no care for bodies; that their separation will in fact be no separation, but only like the thinning out of  a single piece of  beaten gold; and finally that if, after all, there is a division, it is like that of  the moving and meeting legs of  a single compass. The dramatic logic of  this movement lies partly in what’s unspoken. Con- sider what would happen if, in reading the poem, one were to posit in the silence between each stanza a recognition in the speaker of  the preceding stanza’s inability to answer the pain that starts the poem, an inability adequately to evade or transfigure the reality of  the divi- sion, a recognition which is in turn repressed or strained against in the stanza that follows after. It is a continual rhythm of  fantasy driven by tacit disenchantment, as if  between each stanza a voice said silently, 11. See Stein, pp. 171–72. Arthur F. Marotti’s reading of  “The Canonization” as both an acknowledgment and an evasion of  the costs of  his marriage to Ann More—some- thing written for the ears of  a coterie of  worldly and ambitious male friends—though it catches some of the speaker’s painful psychological ruses, studiously avoids exploring the ways that Donne in this poem is in dialogue with himself, with his own more extreme knowledge or poetic and intellectual ambitions. In Marotti’s account of  the poem, the ears of  the coterie are the only ears that count. He acknowledges that Donne’s conceits in “The Canonization” would indeed “have perplexed even the most adept member of his coterie” (a coterie that is after all a very uncertain, speculative entity). But rather than seeing this as evidence of  the limitations of  his own thesis for understanding the poet’s aims and pleasures here, he concludes that this “perplexing” quality must reflect prin- cipally the coterie’s shared understanding of  how impotent mere poetry and wit are as means to resolve their social and political dilemmas. See Marotti, John Donne, Coterie Poet (Madison: University of  Wisconsin Press, 1986), p. 163, and pp. 157–65 more generally. </page> <page sequence="14"> 384 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y in a tone of  mingled delight and regret, “ah, that trope didn’t quite work, I must try another one.” That is the work of  “forbidding” mourn- ing, each conceit struggling to take the measure of  the trope that has just been passed through and passed over, and to supply its lack. In the end, such a dramatic schema may impose on this subtly mov- ing poem an order no less rigid than the Dantesque cosmological- astrological pattern traced there with ferocious will by John Freccero.12 But it has the advantage of  reminding us that Donne’s intricate con- ceits are not simply brilliant, static paradoxes fitted to some established metaphysical belief, but working figures of  desire, tests of  desire, com- plexly motivated wishes. They are wishes that not only express a fixed desire but serve to isolate and defend desires that might otherwise come to grief  in the face of  the real, if  not in the face of  their own incoherence. T. S. Eliot is right in saying (half  in defense and half  in complaint, since he is contrasting Donne with Dante) that Donne here “is not expounding or implying any theory of  the soul in which he could be said to believe; it is never quite certain that he believes any- thing. The figure does not make intelligible an idea, for there is prop- erly no idea until you have the figure; the figure creates the idea—if gold can be beaten out thin, why should not a soul? . . . The immedi- ate experience passes into thought; and this thought, far from attain- ing belief, is the immediate object of  another feeling.” And yet, Eliot adds, “his feeling of  the thought is perfectly sincere.”13 Donne, as is clear from his own explorations of  metaphysical analogy and casuisti- cal logic in his prose, is always conscious of  the willfulness and eva- siveness of  such forms of  argument; he in fact most often uses casuistical reasoning against itself, or foregrounds its dependence on mere possibility rather than on logical or empirical certainty.14 We could say, using Aristotle’s categories, that Donne recognizes the pa- thos or will behind the articulations of  logos or logic—Eliot’s “feeling of  the thought.” Hence it is that in his great defense of  suicide, Bia- thanatos, Donne uses the figure of  thinly beaten gold to describe not the souls of  divided lovers but the endless, thinly spun arguments of 12.

We know, for instance, that Donne’s aggressive and imperious rhetorical questions—“Alas, alas, who’s injured by my love?” (“The Canonization,” line 10)—are real questions, bearing both need and doubt. Likewise we know that his grand, hyperbolic indicatives— “She’is all States, and all Princes, I, / Nothing else is” (“The Sunne Rising,” lines 21–22); “Here upon earth, we’are Kings, and none but wee / Can be such Kings” (“The Anniversarie,” lines 23–24); or “I am every dead thing” (“A Nocturnall upon S. Lucies Day,” line 13)—must be read as complex, fragile optatives. Such statements hold their truth exactly in their untranslatable and overdetermined excess. It is thus precisely wrong to say, as Brian Vickers does, that Donne’s hyperbo- les must be deliberately coded or licit “untruths” that the knowing reader reads, reverses, and decodes, in order to uncover the rational ground of  their fiction.16 This can only strip such hyperbolic utter- ances of  their moral drama. * * * One further example of  the troubled, oddly disenchanted fictions of mastery that haunt these lyrics can be found in Donne’s remarkable study of  romantic ressentiment, “The Apparition.” Here the fantasy of recuperation is sought in the modality of  curse rather than that of blessing: When by thy scorne, O murdresse, I am dead, And that thou thinkst thee free From all solicitation from mee, Then shall my ghost come to thy bed, And thee, fain’d vestall, in worse arms shall see; Then thy sick taper will begin to winke, And he, whose thou art then, being ty’rd before, Will, if  thou stirre, or pinch to wake him, thinke Thou call’st for more, And in false sleepe will from thee shrinke, And then poore Aspen wretch, neglected thou Bath’d in a cold quicksilver sweat wilt lye A veryer ghost then I; 15.

This offers the fantasy of  a lover’s posthumous revenge against the woman who in rejecting him has killed him—though the death itself  is speculative, and she is addressed as “murdresse” pre-emptively, it would seem. What is notable is that the speaker’s thought of  coming back as a threatening spirit ends up putting him into the position of  an invis- ible and impotent voyeur of  his own betrayal. The poem in this sense implicitly acknowledges the despair and abjection of  the very fantasy that frames the moment of  its utterance. It is against the background of  this acknowledgement that the speaker manages to frame a weird image of  the speaker’s “success.” He holds back from imagining him- self  as a directly effective supernatural agent of  terror, blocked per- haps by a combination of  doubt and fear; in the end his ghost seems all but unperceived by the woman he says he will haunt. As if  in com- pensation, however, he conjures up the prophetic image of  his former lover as herself  a “veryer ghost” than he—made so not by him, but rather by her own sexual anxiety and fear of  rejection, by her inabil- ity to waken desire in another (that “he” who feigns sleep to evade her call for more lovemaking). This is what causes the “cold quicksil- ver sweat” to bathe her flesh (itself  a ghost). The fantasy has bite be- cause it makes the woman’s situation a mirror of  the speaker’s, because this promised future so clearly doubles the present state of  erotic loss and fear that feeds his fantasy of  himself  as a ghost. She will come to haunt herself, as he haunts himself. The ghostliness of  the speaker’s persuasions derives from their elu- sive mixing of  demystification and fantasy, and even more so from the ghostly character of  the loss that is thus represented. It is all the harder to parse the situation if  one realizes that we don’t know quite why she stirs or pinches her lover. I have suggested it is her desire, the rejection of  which chills her, but strictly speaking this is only what her lover “thinks” is the reason, hence his turning away. Perhaps, after all, she is only frightened by the uncanny winking of  that “sick taper” (a displaced emblem of  the speaker’s desire? or his impotent revenge?), and so tries to wake him for that reason; or perhaps she “stirs” from nothing but some vague somatic impulse. Donne’s complex imagining of  the woman’s response in fact lends a subtle generosity to the lines. The poem entertains the superstition of  ghosts, but it suggests that the truth of  ghosts and ghostliness lies with the living, that it resides in our most ordinary and intimate psychic fears and abjections, and in how these affect our most ordinary bodily impulses. (In this the </page> <page sequence="17"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 387 poem echoes the truths of  Hamlet). The speaker’s revenge is that his beloved will be a human being, and in that a “veryer ghost.” In the poem’s final lines, he argues that by withholding threatening words that (in the strict terms of  Donne’s fiction) the beloved might not even hear, he is inflicting more pain, since he thus denies her the chance to repent her infidelity; this suggests his state of  loss is more precious to him than the possibility of  getting his lover back. Let me pause over a general point before going on. In characteriz- ing the complex movement of  the speaker’s voice and fantasy in these poems, I have fallen at times into a roughly psychoanalytic language of  investment, wish-fulfillment, projection, defense, mastery, evasion, and repression. This serves to catch something of how the poems work, but it may mistake their peculiar dramatic strength and strangeness. It flexes the wrong analytic muscles, or makes us expect the wrong sort of  answers. The problem is not that this approach leads to confu- sion about whether one is talking about the mind of  John Donne or that of  a fictive speaker, a question the poems themselves refuse to resolve. The issue is of  a different nature. The language of  psycho- analysis functions in essence as a language of  suspicion. It implies that these texts are driven by hidden motives, fed by agencies of  con- cealment, and in this it may compel too crude a kind of  questioning or desire to decode them. There is, of  course, a lot that remains be- yond the horizon of  knowledge in these poems, a lot that pulls our suspicion into play. Leaving aside particular verbal ambiguities, we may wonder about the actual desires of  the woman in “The Flea,” the truth of  the lover’s fidelity in “Valediction: Of  my name in the Win- dow,” or the very identity of  the occulted lovers in “The Curse” or “A Nocturnall upon S. Lucies Day.” The line between the serious and the parodic is drawn fine exactly to leave us guessing. And yet for all their duplicity, paradoxically enough, many of  Donne’s love poems are in fact little exercised by, or given to dramatizing, questions of  conceal- ment, secrecy, and deception. Nor, despite their way of  testing our feeling for the speaker’s beliefs, the passion of  his reason, do they di- rectly dwell on questions of  truth or sincerity, and how these ques- tions bear on the state of  the poet’s or the beloved’s inward self. This is what makes them feel so different from the love lyrics of  poets such as Sir Thomas Wyatt, Sir Philip Sidney, and William Shakespeare. Donne’s love lyrics are the most cerebral poems in the language, and yet they contain few pictures of  self-reflection and little explicit dis- course of  inwardness. One way of  understanding this is to see that one cannot really imagine finding in a Donne lyric such paradigmatic lines as Sidney’s “Looke in thy heart and write” (Astrophil and Stella, sonnet 1, line 14), or Shakespeare’s “Therefore I lie with her, and she </page> <page sequence="18"> 388 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y with me, / And in our faults by lies we flattered be” (sonnet 138, lines 13–14).17 Despite such clearly parodic exceptions as “The Dampe,” it is rare to find in these lyrics even the willfully illusory picture of  some inner identity, of  a self  grounded in its mirroring of  the beloved ob- ject, such as is typical in Petrarchan love poetry—even when such an image is systematically marred, mocked, and deconstructed, as hap- pens in Shakespeare’s sonnets.18 This difference may have something to do with the fact that so many of  Donne’s poems exist as fictions of immediate, dramatic utterance. The engagements of  their speakers are often bound to very local objects and contingent situations, rather than acknowledging themselves as self-reflexive acts of  writing (though acts of  writing figure prominently in some of  the poems).19 As one reads, one’s sense of  the self  or hidden intention of  the speaker is so transported by each successive argument, so thrust back and forth be- tween each fresh persuasion, that any talk of  sincerity or inwardness can seem as little to the point as it does, say, for Christopher Mar- lowe’s eloquent rebel, Tamburlaine.20 It is the moving play of  persua- sions, rather than the idea of  a fixed and hidden self, on which the poems stake their claims on our minds and hearts; it is this that gives 17. I quote from Poems of Sir Philip Sidney, ed. William A. Ringler (Oxford University Press, 1962), p. 165; and William Shakespeare, Sonnets, ed.

Baumlin (n. 4 above), p. 145, notes that the poems do frequently offer themselves to our attention in the guise of  letters, inscriptions, wills, books, and other written doc- uments. Yet even here one feels something dramatically immediate, bound to the pres- ent moment, in the way the poems’ speakers address their words to the reader, and ask him to respond to them. 20. Earlier Renaissance poets like Wyatt and Sidney (though not Spenser) also pitch their imitations of  Petrarchan love poetry in a more self-consciously dramatic vein, mak- ing the poems evolve out of  a play of  contrasting voices, masks, and situational ironies. This is apparent if  we look at what happens in Wyatt’s translations of  Petrarch’s son- nets, for instance his “Whoso list to hunt,” a version of  “Una candida cerva” (Rime sparse 190), where we end with a rhetorical challenge rather than a symbolic tableau. (See Sir Thomas Wyatt, The Complete Poems, ed. R. A. Rebholz [New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1978], p. 77.) We feel something of  this dramatic play throughout Sid- ney’s Astrophil and Stella, with the speaker’s relentlessly experimental donning, testing, and mocking of  the masks of  Petrarchan erotic address. But in Donne a feeling for the lyric as a situational and dramatic thing emerges in a more fully developed and essen- tial way. We have to imagine Donne as someone who, in his youth at least, went often to the theater, and tried to translate some of  its explosive energy within his lyric poetry. As a former friend from his days at the Inns of  Court, Richard Baker, wrote in old age, Donne was “a great frequenter of  Playes” (R. C. Bald, John Donne: A Life [Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1970], p. 72). </page> <page sequence="19"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 389 these poems, obscure as they can be, their astonishing candor. They seem to hide nothing. It is not by accident that I invoke Marlowe, since the stresses Donne puts on his speakers seem so close to what Kimberly Benston de- scribes as the sublime or Longinian strain in Marlowe’s early drama- turgy, especially in Tamburlaine parts 1 and 2. This entails an investment in rhetoric not as a mode of  simply conveying, ornamenting, rational- izing, or concealing the pre-existent contents of  a mind—Sidney’s “fore- conceit”—but rather as the vehicle of  a violent and antithetical will to mastery and self-origination. It points to a form of  utterance in which power and voice are, against all odds, identified, a rhetoric in which eloquence becomes a mode of  magic and charm, and in this a defense against the disabling, unselving, and shameful literality of  death.21 Of  course, Donne’s lyrics are dramatically exacting in their failure to sustain the mode of  sublime hyperbole. Donne never risks bathos as continuously as does Marlowe’s Tamburlaine, in his unremitting figures of  glory, mastery, and triumph, in his oscillations between im- perial expansion and imperial reduction. Donne’s speakers, for one thing, cannot convert the pleasure principle into the reality principle as Tamburlaine does. There is often a fantasy of  magical charm behind the words of  Donne’s lovers, a desire for an utterance with the power to outwit loss or menace. Yet in Donne’s poetry such attempts to match reality to desire always lose ground, even as they provoke more ex- treme or paradoxical retrenchments of  desire. We can see within the scope of  single poems by Donne, one could say, the large movement traced from Marlowe’s Tamburlaine to his Doctor Faustus, in whom the playwright’s early mode found itself  so severely qualified. (Recall here Faustus’s last speech, where, having failed as both a mastering magus and a repentant Christian, and in the face of  damnation, he tries by a kind of  negative magic to conjure himself  into nothing, or into impersonal, soul-less matter.22) What one feels in so many of  the 21. See Kimberly Benston, “ ‘Beauty’s just applause’: Dramatic Form and the Tam- burlainean Sublime,” in Christopher Marlowe: Modern Critical Views, ed. Harold Bloom (New York: Chelsea House, 1985), pp. 205–9. 22. Richard Strier, “John Donne Awry and Squint: The ‘Holy Sonnets,’ 1608–1610,” Modern Philology 86 (1989): 384, suggests tellingly that the conflicts within Faustus’s last speech can be seen as mirroring the vexed, often mis-aligned and incoherent reasoning and metaphor-making of  many of  Donne’s “Holy Sonnets.” I think the analogy applies to a good number of  Donne’s earlier erotic lyrics as well. Strier’s general argument in this essay is that the “Holy Sonnets” often fail both poetically and doctrinally insofar as they do not acknowledge their own partiality and incoherence, concealing their own willfulness and failing to keep faith with their fear. The poems in Songs and Sonnets, by contrast, perhaps because they need not confront absolutes of  faith so starkly, do more </page> <page sequence="20"> 390 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y Songs and Sonnets is not a movement between greater and lesser degrees of  sincerity or true speaking, since one never quite takes the speakers literally in the first place. Rather one is aware of  certain positional shifts in the argument that force one continually to re-evaluate both the limits of  the speaker’s power and the shape of  his desire. We watch the energy with which a given speaker tries to recoup his losses, real or imaginary, how he converts weakness into gain. * * * Many of  the poems I have examined here thrust their speakers sharply into the present tense of  argument and speculation, seduction and evasion; they speak from a place in time where past and future (both real and fantastic pasts and futures) are caught up in a particularly vol- atile mixture. This happens, for example, in those crucial lyrics where Donne inhabits and stretches out wildly, painfully, the threshold mo- ment of  “valediction.” In other poems the sort of  vexed movement of surmises I’ve examined here begins to unfold within the speaker’s account of  a recollected history, as something projected into the past; it may engage the present moment only toward the end of  the poem, as happens in “The Ecstasy” and “Air and Angels.” In “The Apparition,” by contrast, the poet displaces his fictions of  reparation into an am- biguously imagined future, though speaking out of  very present pain. Donne adapts this strategy with even greater extravagance in the last poem I want to explore, “The Relique.” Here, indeed, Donne’s lyric speaker displaces the authorship of  such fictions or surmises away from himself  and assigns it to other, anonymous persons in that imaginary future; he addresses himself  to these future imaginers only at the end of  the poem, and then as a kind of  ghost, challenging and correcting their versions of  his story by pointing to its truth in the present past. The focus of  “The Relique” is a bracelet woven of  a lover’s hair, apparently a token given to the male speaker on the occasion of  their separation, though whether that separation is temporary or perma- nent we are not told. That bracelet is the most obvious referent of  the poem’s title, but not the only one. In any case, its meaning for the lover is left unstated. Whatever we ourselves might guess about its power consistently acknowledge the willfulness and contradictoriness of  their own metaphor- ical arguments, even if  they point toward resolutions that are no less baffling and hard to fix. The larger question of  how my picture of  Donne’s skeptical poetics in the early lyrics relates to his religious poetry is beyond the scope of  this essay. </page> <page sequence="21"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 391 to conjure up a memory or touch of  the lost beloved disappears strangely with the poem’s opening, disappears (in a sense) before we have any chance to think it. Donne begins by projecting the scene of the bracelet’s survival and rediscovery, ringing the arm of  the dead lover himself: When my grave is broke up againe Some second ghest to entertaine, (For graves have learn’d that woman-head To be to more than one a Bed) And he that digs it, spies A bracelet of  bright haire about the bone, Will he not let’us alone, And thinke that there a loving couple lies, Who thought that this device might be some way To make their souls, at the last busie day, Meet at this grave, and make a little stay? (Lines 1–11) This posited future feels to me, most immediately, like a response to some present situation of  loss or violated privacy; it seems to say, that is, “This is what I feel like now, I feel as if  I were alone and in my grave, a place where ‘us’ is only me and this frail token of  you, a place which gives ground at best to desperate fantasies for getting you back.” The activity of  conceit-making thrusts in before we have had a chance to catch our breaths. We may find unsettling enough the contrast be- tween the eroticized (if  conventionally misogynistic) image of  the grave as an unfaithful woman and the sudden leap to speaking of  that bone and hair—glimpsed for a moment in epiphanic yet starkly mate- rial clarity—as a “loving couple.” But even stranger is the suggestion of  how these bodily relics will be read by that future intruder, who proves to be a rather less cynical gravedigger than we find in Hamlet. Extrapolating from the Scholastic fantasy that at the resurrection of the dead, human souls will rush through the world gathering up the scattered fragments and atoms of  their lost bodies, this gravedigger is made to theorize that the dead man’s act of  being buried with that bracelet was a mad and curious trick, a device by which the two di- vided lovers contrived to meet at the end of  time.23 It is a trick that 23. A sermon of  1627 provides a related example of  Donne’s densely materialized vision of  the fate of  the scattered substances of  human bodies at the apocalyptic mo- ment of  the resurrection of  the dead: “Where be all the splinters of  that Bone, which a shot hath shivered and scattered in the Ayre? Where be all the Atoms of  that flesh, which a Corrasive hath eat away, or a Consumption hath breath’d, and exhal’d away from our arms and other Limbs?

One humour of  </page> <page sequence="22"> 392 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y trusts their dead substance to allow them to make a “little stay” against a divine event that otherwise must dissolve that material unit of  buried hair and bone, more absolutely tearing apart the couple it so poig- nantly represents. In a perverse attempt to outwit God or Providence or Grace, the lover strives to preempt not only his own death and dis- interment but also his own resurrection, as if  both death and resurrec- tion must come upon him too quickly, as if  both were a metaphysical affront to the strength of  his mortal love. If  less explicitly than in “The Exstasie,” Donne here takes a stand against the orthodox separation of  body and soul, even as he echoes his dismissal of  the consolations of  heaven in “The Anniversarie.” But then, as if  to confess the very tenuousness of  this thought, and also as a way of  holding onto those bodily relics a little longer, the next stanza constructs a different future. This continues to pre-empt any idea of  divine immortality for the lovers, but now through a different fantasy of  their survival in human misprision, through errors all too possible in Donne’s own present time: If  this fall in a time, or land, Where mis-devotion doth command, Then, he that digges us up, will bring Us, to the Bishop, and the King, To make us Reliques; then Thou shalt be’a Mary Magdelen, and I A something else thereby; All women shall adore us, and some men; And since at such times, miracles are sought, I would that age were by this paper taught What miracles we harmless lovers wrought. (Lines 12–22) our dead body produces worms, and those worms suck and exhaust all other humour, and then all dies, and all dries, and molders into dust, and that dust is blowen into the River, and that puddled water tumbled into the sea, and that ebs and flows in infinite revolutions, and still, still God knows in what Cabinet every seed-Pearle lies, in what part of  the world every graine of  every mans dust lies; and . . . he whispers, he hisses, he beckens for the bodies of  his Saints, and in the twinckling of  an eye, that body that was scattered over all the element is sate down at the right hand of  God, in a glorious res- urrection.” See The Sermons of John Donne, ed.

Carey (n. 2 above), pp. 219–26, discusses what such texts re- flect of  the poet’s fears of  personal loss, dissolution, disintegration, and death, as well as his conviction of  the intrinsication of  human body and human soul. I have not found in the sermons the specific motivating fantasy at work in “The Relique,” which Donne there puts to such heterodox uses, viz., the idea of  individual souls rushing through creation themselves to gather the scattered particles of  their lost bodies at the end of the world. </page> <page sequence="23"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 393 The speaker explicitly calls this worship “mis-devotion,” a grotesque error of  Catholics or perhaps Anglicans (given the spiritual authority of  that King, even in creating idols). Yet again there is a hidden wish that is oddly satisfied here. Remember that the poem’s central conceit recalls a crucial fantasy in Donne. The notion of  being taken as one- self  an object of  study, worship, or love appears in various guises in “The Canonization,” “Twickenham Garden,” “Love’s Exchange,” “The Dampe,” “A Nocturnall upon S. Lucies Day,” and “The Funerall.” Some- times the speaker is converted into a pattern of  transcendent survival, at others he emerges as a type of  radical failure. This fantasy consti- tutes a kind of  dreamlike inversion of  equally common but more anx- ious images in Donne of  the self  being spied on, accused, slandered, and exposed to judgment; it puts the speaker in a position where he can control the terms by which he and others measure things, becom- ing a ground or source of  faith—however tenuous—rather than a victim of  his own and others’ doubt. Still, it isn’t clear what we are to make of  the projection of  the lover’s future relicness in this poem. In one sense it gives the lovers the sta- tus of  martyrs for love, as in “The Canonization,” but at the expense of the particular story of  their love affair being obscured. Furthermore, the terms of  the future worship, in their very obliqueness, carry a tre- mendously risky emphasis. Here the label of  “a Mary Magdelen,” in part a way of  allowing and sublimating the thought of  his lover as a whore, functions most tellingly insofar as it shapes our reading of  “a something else.” The line sounds curiously coy, but I agree with schol- ars like Achsah Guibbory that Donne wants us to hear behind that phrase “a Jesus Christ” (pace the scrupulous objections of  Helen Gardner, who argues that even those given to mis-devotion would know that Christ left no bodily relic upon earth, an argument that only makes clear how outrageous Donne’s thought really is at this mo- ment).24 Donne displaces the speaker’s blasphemy or idolatry onto those future interpreters, and thus distances himself  a bit from their error. But we lose the risky power of  the lines if  we suppose that the poet is simply mocking his own fantasies of  survival, making those anonymous others do the work of  idolizing his beloved. It is again, in Empson’s terms, a high-wire act, a fantasy that cannot be taken 24. See Achsah Guibbory, “ ‘The Relique,’ The Song of  Songs, and Donne’s Songs and Sonnets,” John Donne Journal 15 (1996): 39, and Gardner’s note in The Elegies and Songs and Sonnets (n. 5 above), p. 222. Guibbory’s essay more generally offers a nuanced account of  the balancing act within the poem between a sacramental and highly physi- calized idea of  human love and a more corrosively skeptical attitude toward any such attainment. </page> <page sequence="24"> 394 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y literally, but that challenges the reader who thinks he knows what the nature of  true devotion really is, or knows how clearly to divide the orthodox and the heretical, or knows what the limits of  sacred identi- fication are. The poem asks, implicitly, what makes you think you know what a martyr is? Or what Jesus Christ is, either in his miraculous sur- vival or (given that we hear the hidden phrase as “a Jesus Christ”) his singularity? It also asks, what makes you think that it is better to be an orthodox believer in Hell than this sort of  idolater? In this second stanza, the true facts about the lovers are still un- stated, subject to the wanderings of  surmise. The speaker goes on in the third stanza to explain them, put them into a testimony, but in a way that continues to embrace and enlarge rather than reject the ele- ments of  future mis-devotion. Turning away from the “you,” his lover, and addressing now that future audience, in which we ourselves are enrolled, Donne answers the questionable demand for miracles. He does so in a way that both reinforces the superstitious appeal to mag- ical proof  and attempts to disenchant such claims by showing that the miracle is at best figurative, secular, and private. These, he tells us, are the miracles the harmless lovers wrought: First, we lov’d well and faithfully, Yet knew not what wee lov’d, nor why, Difference of  sex no more we knew, Then our Guardian Angells doe; Coming and going, wee Perchance might kisse, but not between those meales; Our hands ne’er toucht the seales, Which nature, injur’d by late law, sets free: These miracles wee did; but now alas, All measure, and all language, I should passe Should I tell what a miracle shee was. (Lines 23–33) This defense of  a chaste love, so suddenly idealizing, may itself  feel like an act of  purification, a way of  distancing both the eerie humor and intense physicality of  the opening images. Perhaps what Donne offers here is a kind of  tonal conceit: he “yokes together by violence” not two distinct images but two opposing inflections. Granting that we may read this stanza as a bit of  pious evasion (and granting that we do not read it as the utterance of  a madman justifying his fetishism), it seems to me that these lines also ask to be read in a tone of  considerable bit- terness. The story of  the lovers’ purity would thus become something thrown back at the world of  those who suspect these lovers of  some- thing that they after all did not or could not do, something that was denied them; it is a taunt thrown back at all those who would approve </page> <page sequence="25"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 395 of  their merely ceremonial obedience to a law that the speaker him- self  thinks an injury to nature. The last line would then be uttered in scorn of  the very idea of  a miracle such as the future public seems to want. Such a reading would defend the poem’s closing lines from Chris- topher Ricks’s otherwise penetrating criticisms in his essay “Donne after Love,” where he argues that many of  the poems in Songs and Son- nets end in a disappointing, evasive, or weakly self-mocking fashion, as if  out of  a failure of  will, or from the poet’s shock of  disgust at the meaning and consequence of  his own desire.25 It may look something like that in “The Relique,” but in this case the apparent failure is part of  a more complex gesture. For in the guise of  what can seem a wholly conventional example of  the inexpressibility topos, Donne accom- plishes something very striking. He abandons the thought of  explicit praise for his beloved not simply in the face of  a miraculous object whose virtues exceed words, but also in the face of  an audience that doesn’t have any idea of  what the work of  finding words of  praise itself  amounts to, an audience hungry for miracles, but whose ways of reading human and divine value or of  dividing true and false devo- tion are seen as hopelessly in error. The poem unfolds against the background of  a true love lost, spent, and obscured, an affair conveyed to us through misleading, forgotten, or misread signs. The purported miracle of  that love is restored at the end to its purity, but at a cost, for we scarcely have any grasp of what the love affair amounted to, what the relic or relics mean, what “those meales” consisted of. The poem’s final refusal of  an answer does not sublimate their love beyond customary categories of  the sacred and the profane. Rather, it challenges readers to consider less narrowly what such categories are, to think more sharply about the nature of  idolatry and miracle, and what it means to testify to them.26 It asks us to think about how the sacred and secular interanimate each other, and about the shifts we are put to in the face of  our failure to 25. See Christopher Ricks, “Donne after Love,” in Literature and the Body: Essays on Populations and Persons, ed. Elaine Scarry (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), pp. 33–69. 26. Stein (n. 6 above) sees here an exemplary version of  Donne’s evolving processes of  thought in his poetry. In stanza 3, he suggests, two intriguing but ignorant specula- tions about the meaning of  the “relique”—the gravedigger’s private fantasy of  the lover’s trick and the more public conjectures of  a superstitious culture on the lookout for mir- acles—are replaced by the speaker’s own vision of  a subtler, more accurate, more pene- trating, also more disciplined ignorance, one neither accidental nor willful, but rather the “true, essential ignorance of  the nature of  their faithful love: ‘Yet knew not what wee lov’d, nor why’ ” (p. 138). This feels right for the balance of  the poem’s ending, but my own sense is that this invocation of  that latter ignorance still serves Donne to wind even more finely the thread of  his skeptical reflection on the lovers. </page> <page sequence="26"> 396 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y find certainties about either category. The speaker’s written “paper”— itself  a relic, a testimony to be read by those future persons (and in this a trope of  Donne’s love lyrics more generally, texts circulating in manuscript among his readers)—offers no assurance, no sacramental word, no magical sign. It may mobilize a reader’s wish to make some- thing sacred of  it, as the gravedigger and others do with the skeleton and its bracelet, but the text also offers itself  to anyone taking on the role of  advocatus diaboli, that is to say, the cleric who in Roman Cath- olic tradition must compile the case against candidates for sainthood. * * * If  there is an ironic gap in a poem like “The Relique,” it locates itself not simply, as dramatic irony does, between the situation of the speaker and the truths of  his utterance, but also between the poem and its reader. In silencing himself, Donne’s speaker draws a line around a sphere of  erotic experience in a way that makes it at once empty and full; he creates a realm of  mutuality that, sealed from our understand- ing, puts our desire to know it to the test. He demands that we take up some stance toward that sealed sphere, even in relation to other people’s skewed descriptions of  it. This occurs if  for no other reason than that “The Relique,” through figures like the gravedigger, bishop, and king, implicates us in the play of  speculative judgment. To speak broadly: the poem moves us between two equally crucial and unanswer- able questions. First, what is the nature of  the poet’s investment in his fiction? Second, what is the nature of  our investment in it? Or better, what claims does that fiction have on us, what might we be willing to invest in it? In trying to make sense of  the poem, we do not ask “Do these descriptions get the world right?” but rather, “What would it be like to believe this, what would happen if  I did?” A poem like “The Relique” makes these questions particularly difficult to answer. Read- ing “The Canonization,” we may feel as if  we know some part of  what it means to beg a pattern of  the sainted lovers; we may think we know why that spectral voyeur in “The Exstasie” will “part far purer than he came.” In “The Relique,” however, the intersection of  error and opacity in the fictive surmise, so suffused with humor and longing, suspends us before the text in a situation of  starker, more poignant doubt. This heightened feeling of  skeptical suspension recalls the situation of  the seeker after true religion addressed in Donne’s “Satire 3.” This poem lets us hear a voice caught between deep distrust of  all sects and schisms—hating their dogmatism and cruelty, their infectious and fanatic fantasies, their cowardice and blindness—and a pressing, un- </page> <page sequence="27"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 397 shaped demand to find a fixed truth that will give weight to his skep- ticism, and keep his caustic satire from yielding merely a cry of  de- spair.27 A certain kind of diligent standing in place is thus no bad thing: To’adore, or scorn an image, or protest, May all be bad; doubt wisely; in strange way To stand inquiring right, is not to stray; To sleepe, or runne wrong, is. On a huge hill, Cragged, and steep, Truth stands, and hee that will Reach her, about must, and about must goe; And what th’hill’s suddennes resists, winne so. (Lines 76–82)28 Of course, one might say that what allows the fictions of  Donne’s early lyrics to unfold so freely against the background of  such doubt—such standing in place or running in circles—is simply that these poems are secular fictions rather than sacred utterances; they are licit untruths that know themselves to be feigned. But this kind of  qualification is inadequate to poems that, at their most powerful, implicate a wide range of  theological speculation and religious skepticism within their erotic fictions. What is risky about Donne’s love poems is exactly their attempt to inhabit and map a polymorphous realm of  thought that muddles purifying dichotomies between the sacred and the profane, or between true worship and idolatry. (They know as well the idola- tries of  the iconoclasts.) There is an eerie, inchoate piety even in what some have called their blasphemies. One product of  Donne’s skepti- cal stance is a poetry of  willfully perverse and corrosive irony, like that which we find in Metempsychosis. But against this possibility one can point not only to the more resonant religious doubt of  “Satire 3” but to the rigorous and “skeptical charity” that animates Donne’s anatomy of  suicide, Biathanatos. The aim of  this book is not to offer a blanket or positive defense of  “self-homicide,” much less to offer a merely self- cancelling exercise in conceptual paradox.29 Its urgent moral purpose 27. For a probing adjudication of  the religious skepticism of  “Satire 3,” see Richard Strier’s essay “Impossible Radicalism I: Donne and the Freedom of  Conscience,” in his Resistant Structures: Particularity, Radicalism, and Renaissance Texts (Berkeley: University of  California Press, 1995), pp. 118–64. Joshua Scodel as well carefully adjudicates the satire’s pursuit of  a “skeptical mean” in his Excess and Mean in Early Modern English Lit- erature (Princeton University Press, 2002), pp. 21–37. 28. The text of  “Satire 3” is quoted from Milgate’s edition of  The Satires, Epigrams and Verse Letters (n. 1 above). 29. Both Slights (n. 14 above), pp. 137–44, and Neil Rhodes, in his introduction to his edition of  Donne’s Selected Prose (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1987), pp. 8–12, em- phasize the sheer display of  self-ironizing casuistry in Biathanatos. Neither scholar seems </page> <page sequence="28"> 398 MODE R N  PH I L O LO G Y is rather to “remove scandal,” to call false certainties into question, in particular to challenge the spiritually coercive claims of  established churches, moral codes, and legal authorities to know without a doubt what the inward state of  conscience must be that grounds the abso- lute sinfulness of  this particular human act. Biathanatos is a book in which Donne, as he does in the lyrics, seals off  a sphere of  human ex- perience from any final judgment by human beings in this world, in- deed grants it what may seem an arcane, even divine prerogative (as when he considers that suicide may witness a holy love like that of  the martyr, or even Christ himself, suggesting that “holy Men may be redy to expresse theyr Loves to one another, by violence to themselves”).30 Donne grants to that sphere of  conscience a voice that, by its very un- fathomability and opacity, cries out against any attempts to interpret or silence it, even if  we do not know what it will say; he grants it a lib- erty to know and act beyond what human language can predicate. Of  course, the distinction between inside and outside cannot be literally maintained for a dramatic lyric such as “The Relique,” even assuming such a distinction works for conscience-ridden human beings.31 What we could call the conscience of  this poem has no fixed place, but hovers in a middle distance between writer and his text, its different voices, also between the text and its reader. Indeed, to ideal- ize the poem’s secrecy, and so fix its mystery, by analogy with the space of  conscience described in Biathanatos risks literalizing one of  Donne’s most common strategic tropes, that is, a poetic speaker’s willful, insis- tent appeal to his and his lover’s unreadability, an appeal that serves as a means of  putting off  his own deep fear of  being judged by others, perhaps even by himself. The fact is that in reading these poems we ready to allow that Donne could, at least some of  the time, mean exactly what he says about the radical possibility of  human suicide being beyond external or public judg- ment, and capable of  being undertaken in absolute purity of  conscience, indeed with a divine blessing. Carey, pp. 204–9, takes Biathanatos more seriously as a key document for our understanding of  Donne’s demand for imaginative freedom and mastery, as well as his understanding of  their terrible risks. As Donne writes at the end of  the book, “I abstayned purposely from extending this discourse to perticular Rules, or in- stances, both because I dare not professe my selfe, a Master in so curious a scyence, and because the Limmits are obscure, and steepy, and slippery, and narrow, and every Error deadly” (Biathanatos [n. 15 above], p. 145). 30. Donne, Biathanatos, p. 132. 31. Stein comments sagely that Donne “has, as we know, some firm intellectual be- liefs in the limits as well as the responsibilities of  consciousness. He is not willing to solve his imaginative problems by accepting arbitrary divisions between the inside world and the outside world” (p. 172). </page> <page sequence="29"> Kenneth Gross „ John Donne’s Lyric Skepticism 399 cannot merely suspend our judgment, we cannot not become ironists and moralists. The poems’ spiritual temper demands a stance of  judg- ment or suspicion, without which one could scarcely be gripped by or take pleasure in their intricate play of  wish and will, fantasy and disil- lusionment, slander and counterslander. And yet even if  the poems compel and indulge such suspicion, they are wise enough to let us know that we cannot stop there. Love is at the limit, and a continual promise. </page> </plain_text>
