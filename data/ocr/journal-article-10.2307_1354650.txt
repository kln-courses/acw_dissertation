<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEMORY AS FORGETTING THE PROBLEM OF THE POSTMODERN IN KUNDERA'S THE BOOK OF LAUGHTER AND FORGETTING AND SPIEGELMAN'S MAUS Eric Berlatsky In one of poststructuralism's most-quoted statements, Jacques Derrida declared in his Of Grammatology that "there is no outside- the-text" (1974, 158). While Derrida (and many of his deconstructive followers) are principally interested in revealing the internal contra- dictions of foundational philosophy based on binary divisions (or at least the ways in which such philosophies have been traditionally interpreted), his above declaration also suggests the impossibility of finding truth, not merely in its transcendental philosophical sense, but also in the possibility of a material and historical referent. This assertion of the textuality of existence and the difficulty/impossibil- ity of accessing a reality outside of representation and signification were not (at least initially) applied specifically to "history" as a con- cept by Derrida, but its implications in the postmodern world still resonate, particularly, as we shall see, in the case of traumatic events and historical incidents that serve as sites of communal and individ- ual identification for oppressed peoples. Likewise, one of the most prominent philosophers of the postmodern, Jean-Francois Lyotard, asserts that postmodernism (and modernism itself)1 takes place in the realization that Enlightenment rationalism and scientific posi- tivism are not tied to objective truth and reality, but rather are merely "language games," like narrative itself, that create "the effects of real- ity," that, in a postmodern age, become "the fantasies of realism" (Lyotard 1984, 74). In this context, "realistic" fiction, "objective" his- tory, and positivist science not only become misled in their attempts to configure the world as an eminently understandable and coherent Cultural Critique 55-Fall 2003-Copyright 2003 Regents of the University of Minnesota</page><page sequence="2">102 | ERIC BERLATSKY system, they also become ideologically charged deceptive practices that posit an immanent and essentialized world where none exists (a realization that is linked to Derrida in its emphasis on textuality and "language games" rather than on reality and essential truth).2 This postmodern/poststructural emphasis on the "real" as inex- tricable from the constructed and the textual has also found its way into both historiography and historical fiction (particularly in that breed of postmodernist fiction labeled "historiographic metafiction" by Linda Hutcheon) with potentially troubling social and political repercussions. This is particularly the case because of the ways in which the historical real is a site of political contestation. In this essay, I investigate the ways in which the inaccessibility of the real and the truth as discussed above has political and social repercussions in the "politics of memory." To do so, I look closely at two works of postmodernist fiction3 that deal explicitly with the politics of memory and what Lyotard has labeled the "withdrawal of the real" (1984, 79). Both Milan Kundera's The Book of Laughter and Forgetting and Art Spiegelman's Maus propose and illustrate the traditionally central importance of both individual and collective mem- ory in advancing the political interests of oppressed peoples, partic- ularly in protecting a communality and shared identification from the effacing powers of "official" or institutional history. However, both authors also point to the ways in which memory itself (both individ- ual and collective) is inextricable from textuality and can itself be a mode of political oppression. In doing so, both authors foreground the difficulty for socially and politically oppressed peoples to par- ticipate in their own coherent and stable identity formation and rep- resentation through memory in an age identified as postmodern. Through the investigation of two texts preoccupied both with mem- ory and with a postmodern aesthetic, I will show how they reveal how postmodernism can be not only productive in its destabilization of power, but also problematic in its difficulties in offering concrete and stable counterdiscourses that do not themselves participate in oppression. Kundera's The Book of Laughter and Forgetting and Spiegel- man's Maus stage the problem of the postmodern4 in the theater of memory by foregrounding memory's necessity in resisting power, while admitting its own tenuous ties to the real and its implication in the abuse of power.</page><page sequence="3">MEMORY AS FORGETTING I 103 MEMORY AND ITS POLITICS IN KUNDERA AND SPIEGELMAN Kundera's The Book of Laughter and Forgetting opens with two scenes that foreground the importance of individual and collective memory as important political tools to fight oppression. The first scene, set in 1948, depicts the frightening ability of the totalitarian Soviet-led regime in Prague to deface, erase, and rewrite history to suit its own ideological ends. To illustrate this ability to alter history, Kundera relates the true story of Gottwald and Clementis, both Communist leaders. Gottwald gives a speech outdoors with Clementis by his side. Because it is cold and snowing, Clementis takes off his hat and places it on Gottwald's head. As Kundera describes, the moment became famous and was reproduced copiously. "On that balcony the history of Communist Bohemia began" (3). Four years later, like Trotsky in Russia, Clementis was charged with treason and eventually hanged. "The propaganda section immediately made him vanish from his- tory and, of course, from all photographs .... Nothing remains of Clementis but the fur hat on Gottwald's head" (3-4). Kundera here underlines the possibility of, and inherent danger in, the effacing of historical "fact." Where Clementis once stood as a symbol of the brotherhood and good feeling of Communism in its optimistic youth, now he is erased, no longer useful for a totalitarian regime. The novel continues to point out the ways in which history is controlled and dictated by those in power and the devastating effects that historical manipulation can have. Gustav Husak was the seventh president of Czechoslovakia, put into power by the Russians in 1969, and is named by the Kundera-narrator as the "President of Forget- ting" (217). Husak earned the name by driving 145 Czech historians from research institutes and universities (218). In response to this, a displaced historian asserts, "You begin to liquidate a people ... by taking away its memory. You destroy its books, its culture, its history .... Then the people slowly begins to forget what it is and what it was. The world at large forgets it faster" (218). When the Kundera- narrator suggests, however, that "Nothing remains of Clementis," he is clearly being ironic and disingenuous. Clementis exists, at the very least, in Kundera's memory.5 This fact is emphasized in the second scene of the novel, set in 1971 during the reign of Husak. Mirek, a resident of Prague, attempts to</page><page sequence="4">104 | ERIC BERLATSKY prevent the erasure of history through the vehicle of his own mem- ory. Mirek says, "The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting." In doing so, he attempts "to justify what his friends call carelessness," for what facilitates memory on one hand is the evidence for accusations of subversiveness on the other (4). Mirek's friends are concerned that his collections of diary, corre- spondence, and minutes of meetings will be discovered and used as evidence against him. Nevertheless, Mirek is intent on preserving and controlling his memories in the hope of resisting power. The notion of memory as an inherent bastion in the battle against political and social oppression is illustrated by, but is by no means limited to, Kundera's Book. Similar discourses have been fore- grounded in virtually all popular discussions of what is known as the Holocaust or the Shoah, the extermination of millions of Jews by the Nazis during the Second World War.6 In this discourse, the very act of memory becomes a primary constituent of a Jewish identity and is meant to ensure that a similar act of oppression never occurs again. In this context, Jewish writer Cynthia Ozick has emphasized "the necessity of memory in a time when memory begins to melt into his- tory and history is discarded" (quoted in Brogan 1998, 163).7 Indeed, the memory of the Holocaust has been seen by some to replace the other communal memories of Judaism. In observing a community seder in Texas, Phillip Lopate saw that "the Shoah was at the heart of their faith; it was what touched them most deeply about being Jew- ish. The religion itself-the prayers, the commentaries, the rituals, the centuries of accumulated wisdom and tradition-had shriveled to a sort of marginally necessary preamble for this negative miracle" (quoted in Gilman 1991, 34).8 It is the allegiance to the memory of the Holocaust that has spawned so many narratives of survival of the death camps, includ- ing the unorthodox Maus, Art Spiegelman's comic-book depiction of his father's (Vladek's) experience in Auschwitz. The desire to remem- ber and to construct a Jewish identity from that memory must have played a role in Spiegelman's desire to record (through note taking and audiotapes) and represent Vladek's story. It is also this belief in the centrality of memory that leads Artie (Spiegelman's autobio- graphical representation in Maus) to reproach Vladek for destroying the diaries of Anja, Vladek's wife:</page><page sequence="5">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 105 VLADEK: After Anja died I had to make an order with everything. These papers had too many memories. So I burned them. ARTIE: Did you ever read any of them? Can you remember what she wrote? VLADEK: No. I looked in. But I don't remember. Only I know that she said, "I wish my son, when he grows up, he will be interested by this." ARTIE: GOD DAMN YOU! YOU-YOU MURDERER! HOW THE HELL COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING!! VLADEK: Ach. (Maus, 159) Like Kundera's depiction of the propaganda machine that oblit- erates Clementis, and in doing so strikes a blow for "power" against man, Vladek has contributed (in Artie's eyes) to the forces of "for- getting" against the forces of memory. Artie's hope for a coherent remembered past from which to construct his own identity is denied by his father's destruction of the diary. The political importance of memory, foregrounded in these pas- sages, is not merely hypothetical. The prevalence of self-titled "revi- sionist historians," labeled "Holocaust deniers" by their adversaries, who deny the existence of the Holocaust, the existence of gas cham- bers, and the plan of the "final solution" itself, represent, for many, the attempt to erase and efface history in an attempt to perpetuate anti-Semitism. Kenneth Stern, of the American Jewish Committee, refers to the memory of the Holocaust as a protective force against prevalent anti-Semitism. "If the Holocaust is denied, relativized, recedes from memory with the passing of generations ... a brak- ing force against the two-thousand-year world tradition of anti- Semitism will be diminished" (1993, 24). Like Kundera's Mirek, Stern invokes the power of memory as a bulwark against power and hatred. Personal memory and witnessing are, in this case, used as one type of historical evidence, but they are also used as a counter- balance to the manipulatable documentary evidence of history. It is this centrality of memory that leads French historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet to title his book denouncing the denial of the Holo- caust Assassins of Memory. Vidal-Naquet responds specifically to the accusations of one of the primary French deniers of the Holocaust's</page><page sequence="6">106 | ERIC BERLATSKY existence, Robert Faurisson, whose 1978 article, "The Problem of the Gas Chambers or the Rumor of Auschwitz" (Vidal-Naquet 1992, xi), was one of the initial attempts to deny the Holocaust's existence (an attempt that, unfortunately, has spawned many followers and con- tinued efforts by Faurisson himself ). One interesting aspect of these pseudohistorical accounts is their refusal to allow personal memory as a means of evidence. David Cole, a Holocaust revisionist who appeared on a talk show in 1992 to discuss the subject, denied the potential verifiability of eyewitness memory: "I hear eyewitnesses and then I hear other forensic and factual evidence. What am I supposed to do?" (quoted in Stern 1993, 132). Lyotard ironically iden- tifies the deniers' position on the impossibility of reliable memory- evidence: "His argument is: to identify a site as a gas chamber, I shall accept as a valid witness only a victim of such a gas chamber; now according to my adversary, such victims can only be dead; other- wise the gas chambers would not be what it is claimed to be; thus there are no gas chambers" (quoted in Vidal-Naquet 1992, 144 nl7). Faurisson's attack on memory and its power leads Vidal-Naquet to his title, and gives Mirek and Artie ample reason, it seems, to fight relentlessly to retain their own personal memory against the poten- tial effacement of history. From these examples, we might be inclined to see both Kundera and Spiegelman operating within (rather than against) a positivist, liberal humanist aesthetic and ideology. Mirek and Artie's protests against the erasure, or manipulation, of historical fact seem to be about an epistemological problem rather than an ontological one. The implication by Mirek is that reality and truth do exist, but that totalitarian forces are working to efface them. Likewise, Artie's pro- tests seem to indicate that, given all of the documentary evidence, his mother's identity (and his own) can be recaptured. The binary of memory versus forgetting positions the institutional (historical) forces on the side of forgetting versus the personal forces on the side of memory. Nevertheless, if postmodernism is about anything, it is about the blurring of binaries and the dissolution of bound- aries. While postmodernism may declare that the past is "evacuated of history and . .. [this evacuation is] a signal of the artifice of any such account, any history" (Crapanzano 1995, 137), it does not de- clare memory as the immanent and essential replacement for history.</page><page sequence="7">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 107 Rather, like history, memory, autobiography, and memoir have been unmoored from their tenuous claims to "touching the world."9 Through their mutual commitment to a postmodern aesthetic, Kun- dera and Spiegelman place their political defense of memory into question, both by problematizing memory's own ties to referential- ity and by exposing memory's role in the administration of power. As both Kundera and Spiegelman clearly show, history, memory, and identity (including their own) are, at least partially, matters of social construction, texts not truths. The question of whether or not Mirek's or Vladek's memories can found themselves politically outside of Derrida's metaphorical text and in a material reality is a question of real political significance. In addition, (post)modernity's consistent questioning of the capacity of memory to exist independently of for- getting, or of the representation of memory that inevitably recon- figures it, destabilizes the possibility of memory being deployed as a political bulwark.10 HISTORY, MEMORY, AND COLLECTIVE MEMORY The differences between history, individual memory, and collective (or communal) memory are complex and at times difficult to distin- guish. Nevertheless, with the essential importance of memory in resisting power specified earlier, it becomes necessary to construct some working definitions. For theorists of "history" like Michel de Certeau, Michel Foucault, and Maurice Halbwachs, the practice of history in the West (or of the creation of history by Western histori- ans) is, at least traditionally, one that attempts to create a unity and an order out of the past. As de Certeau asserts, "[History] customar- ily began with limited evidence . . . and it took as its task the spong- ing of all diversity off of them, unifying everything into coherent comprehension" (1988, 78). De Certeau goes on to explain that his- tory is that which in turn gives the (dominant) society of the present a way to define themselves against that past (or in comparison to the "other" of the past). "[I]ntelligibility is established through a relation to the other; it moves (or 'progresses') by changing what it makes of its 'other'-the Indian, the past, the people, the mad, the child, the Third World" (3; my emphasis). Foucault's philosophical affiliation</page><page sequence="8">108 | ERIC BERLATSKY with the "others" of the world makes him similarly critical and at times antagonistic to the traditional (or "classical") history that de Certeau describes here. As Foucault asserts in a rare moment of direct confrontation, "The traditional devices for constructing a com- prehensive view of history and for retracing the past as a patient and continuous development must be systematically dismantled" (88). Like de Certeau and Foucault, Halbwachs concurs that the "model" history has always been one of retrospective unification, the narrativi- zing and reconciling of diverse elements into a comprehensive and comprehensible story (see Halbwachs 1980, 101-5). As de Certeau and Foucault also suggest, history always asserts its referentiality, insisting on the existence of certain events while simultaneously shaping them into an intelligible story that separates the present from the past. Certainly, we might see an extreme and twisted form of this ver- sion of history in the treatment of Clementis in Communist Bohemia. When Clementis (and his hat) are viewed as part of Czech history (i.e., when this foundational moment is part of the Czech past that is meant to help define its present), the moment is allowed to survive in the narrative of the nation. However, when the present Czechoslo- vakia has no use for this past (or when it does not fit into the unified story it presents to itself ), Clementis is obliterated from official his- tory. While this erasure is clear and obvious to anyone who remem- bers the history in which Clementis is included, theorists like de Certeau and Foucault assert that any classical or traditional unifying history that attempts to define the present by separating it from the "other" of the past, commits similar violence.11 Rather, Foucault sug- gests that "history becomes 'effective' to the degree that it introduces discontinuity into our very being.... 'Effective' history deprives the self of the reassuring stability of life and nature, and it will not per- mit itself to be transported by a voiceless obstinacy toward a millen- nial ending" (1984, 88). Here Foucault juxtaposes history as it has previously been practiced and suggests a new history (or genealogy) that dismantles, rather than unifies (one that might allow Clementis to remain in the picture even after he is no longer part of the ideology of the ruling class). Of course, rather than the "new" history that Foucault pro- poses, many theorists have suggested memory as the opposite to and</page><page sequence="9">MEMORY AS FORGETTING I 109 reparative for history. Halbwachs, perhaps most famous for his work on "collective memory," sees memory as that which retains and holds continuities and consistencies within communities rather than the dramatic changes and ruptures between the present and the past that history chronicles. History, I have said, is not interested in these intervals when nothing apparently happens, when life is content with repetition in a somewhat different but essentially unaltered form without rupture or upheaval. But the group, living first and foremost for its own sake, aims to per- petuate the feelings and images forming the substance of its thought. (1980, 85-86) If this is the case, the critiques of history by de Certeau, Foucault, and others seem to apply less to collective memory that does not seek to define the present by homogenizing the "other" of the past, but rather is content to protect and preserve shared traditions, feelings, and images. As Halbwachs discusses, all individuals are part of sev- eral communities or "collectives" and each individual's memories are constructed in relationship to those communities with no mem- ory being purely individual or outside of a group context.12 This basic (although perhaps not sufficiently nuanced) distinction between memory (particularly collective memory) and history has caused some commentators to stress the distinctions between them and to bemoan the loss of memory with the advent of modernity. Memory and history, far from being synonymous, appear now to be in fundamental opposition. Memory is life, borne by living societies founded in its name. It remains in permanent evolution, open to the dialectic of remembering and forgetting, unconscious of its successive deformations, vulnerable to manipulation and appropriation, suscepti- ble to being long dormant and periodically revived. History, on the other hand, is the reconstruction, always problematic and incomplete, of what is no longer. Memory is a perpetually actual phenomenon, a bond tying us to the eternal present; history is a representation of the past. (Nora 1989, 8) This dichotomy is similar to the one initially suggested by both Maus and The Book of Laughter and Forgetting as detailed earlier. Mem- ory, in these texts, seems to be a tie to a community and an identity that is in danger of eradication by the forces of history. Artie and</page><page sequence="10">110 I ERIC BERLATSKY Mirek at first seem to seek to retain the "continuous present" of their memory (tied explicitly to the collective memory of the Jewish com- munity and the radical Czech past) in resistance to the defacing and erasing power of a retrospective renarrativization by a dominant power (as in the totalitarian Czech regime) or the obliteration from within (as in the case of Vladek's destruction of the diaries). The definition of "history" as provided here by de Certeau and Foucault is, of course, not part of the traditional definition, but rather part of the poststructural attack on that definition (or is its own revi- sion of that definition). It is worthwhile to point out, however, that de Certeau and Foucault take part in the attempt to distance history from the real by revealing and stressing its inextricable ties to dis- course. As de Certeau points out, in French (and in English) the word for past events and their retelling are the same ("history"), highlight- ing the impossibility of direct access to a historical real that is un- mediated by discourse.13 Like Derrida, they argue, in this case, that history cannot be "outside the text," and that rather than merely pre- senting the world, it "re-presents" it, substituting (or supplement- ing) discourse for the real. As Roland Barthes puts it, "Historical discourse does not follow the real; rather, it only signifies it, endlessly reiterating that it happened, but without having this assertion be any- thing other than the obvious underside of all historical narrative" (1967, 73-74; emphasis in original). This move in historiography reflecting the postmodern "with- drawal of the real" has become fairly widespread and is reflected in much contemporary discourse. As Janet Abu-Lughod puts it, "ac- counts of social events are 'constructions' rather than descriptions isomorphic with some 'objective reality"' (1989, 112). Or in Vincent Crapanzano's words, Today, in an age that has been declared postmodern ... the ruin has been replaced by the quotation, the trace, really a pseudo-trace, a detri- tus, a referent, a carrying back to/from a past, that is so completely decontextualized, so open to recontextualization, that it... becomes at once an emblem of a past evacuated of history and a signal of the arti- fice of any such account, any history. (1995, 137) In other words, to varying degrees, Crapanzano and Abu- Lughod acknowledge and assume that no historical account can be</page><page sequence="11">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 111 said to present what actually occurred. Rather, history, like fiction, is the representation of events in a narrative form, which uses narra- tive's techniques to create an artificial text. In many ways, as Hayden White has pointed out, the presentation of history in narrative form allows for the interpretation of history as a story, a plot with inherent meaning, where the conglomeration of historical events and detritus does not (necessarily) have meaning on its own. "In this world, real- ity wears the mask of a meaning, the completeness and fullness of which we can only imagine, never experience.... historical stories ... give to reality the odor of the ideal. This is why the plot of a historical narrative is always an embarrassment and has to be presented as 'found' in the events rather than put there by narrative techniques" (1980, 20; emphasis in original). White here takes the less extreme postmodern position that reality does, in fact, exist, but that the shap- ing and presentation of that reality through language (and particu- larly through narrative) fictionalizes it, shapes it into a story that cannot have unmediated access to reality. White is one of the primary figures in what is often termed "poststructuralist historiography," asserting in his Metahistory the ways in which history and historical narration is manipulated and shaped by various modes of "emplot- ment," the shaping of found historical events into various (predeter- mined) narrative forms that govern future interpretation and the cognitive understanding of traditional historical narrative. If history, in a postmodern age, is less identifiably tied to the real because of its tendency toward emplotment, contextualization, and retrospective narrativization, attempts like Mirek's and Artie's to oppose memory to history constitute an effort to arrest the "with- drawal of the real" by adverting to the continuous present that Pierre Nora and others find as constitutive of memory rather than history. This attempt, however, falters when faced with the many theoriza- tions of memory itself as disconnected from the real. Personal memory is, of course, most clearly represented by the genres of autobiography and memoir. As Paul John Eakin observes, "The presence of fiction in autobiography . . . tends to make us uneasy, for we instinctively feel that autobiography is ... precisely not-fiction" (1985, 9). Neverthe- less, postmodern culture and poststructuralist theory have, of course, denied the possibility of a true representation of the self through lan- guage (particularly in Paul de Man's account of autobiography) and</page><page sequence="12">112 | ERIC BERLATSKY the true recovery of the self through memory. In addition, whereas some assume that autobiography is the objective representation of the self and presentation of past events, de Man suggests: We assume that life produces the autobiography as an act produces its consequences, but can we not suggest, with equal justice, that the auto- biographical project may itself produce and determine the life and that whatever the writer does is in fact governed by the technical demands of self-portraiture and thus determined in all its aspects by the resources of his medium (1979, 920; emphasis in original). This typically poststructural reversal of signifier and signified sug- gests the creativity and performativity of the self in writing. Rather than representing an essential "self," this view assumes that there is only the representation (or representations), and that memory and the self are created out of linguistic performance. It is this view of memory that seems to subvert the political effi- cacy of both Mirek's and Artie's attempt to fight power through memory. Both Kundera and Spiegelman seem, at first, to be devoted to recapturing or defending a truth for progressive political pur- poses, to prevent its effacement by totalitarian or anti-Semitic forces. In response to this conception, one might see the ideas of postmod- ernism (the "withdrawal of the real") as a danger to their political aims, a relativism akin to that of the Holocaust deniers. If, as one strand of criticism offers, "the postmodern is disqualified from polit- ical involvement because of its narcissistic and ironic appropriation of existing images and stories" (Hutcheon 1989,3), as well as its insis- tence on the incomprehensibility or impossibility of identifying a referent, it would seem to be irrelevant to the political and socially directed work that Kundera and Spiegelman are doing. Neverthe- less, both authors make use of metafictional, or postmodernist, tech- niques in their attempts to achieve their political and aesthetic goals. Certainly, from the perspective of a theorist like Fredric Jameson, postmodernism is a reflection of the decadence and narcissism of capitalist culture, not a means for active political discourse. However, for other theorists and practitioners of what we might call postmod- ernist fiction, the disappearance of the referent, the provisionality of truth, and the denial of any totalizing master narratives provide lib- eratory opportunities. In this context, the master narratives of (for</page><page sequence="13">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 113 example) patriarchy, whiteness, centrality, heterosexuality, and West- ern discourse are seen as merely fictional histories that are (particu- larly in light of Foucauldian social theory) implements of power. The power to deconstruct these narratives and provide alternative narra- tives or counterhistories is essential to the politically radical branch of postmodern thought. The ability to create the self, to re-present history, and to "play" in the newly unleashed signifiers is a political opportunity to topple, destroy, and provisionally replace the master narratives already in place. KUNDERA AND POSTMODERN MEMORY Where Mirek in "Lost Letters," the first section of The Book, desper- ately hoards items of memory in an attempt to resist power, he also attempts to destroy other items that he does not wish to include (or accept) as part of his identity. Mirek sets out on an attempt to destroy love letters he once sent to Zdena, a former lover, by reclaiming the letters from her. He does not wish them to be part of his memory, his memory collection, or his identity. Rather, he wishes to create an identity for himself out of his selected past. His connection to his life was that of a sculptor to his statue or a novel- ist to his novel. It is an inviolable right of a novelist to rework his novel. If the opening does not please him, he can rewrite it or delete it. But Zdena's existence denied Mirek that author's prerogative. Zdena in- sisted on remaining on the opening pages of the novel and did not let herself be crossed out. (15) Kundera's reputation as a master ironist is built on such moments as these; Mirek struggles against institutional power on one hand, while he attempts to construct his own identity through an act of power on the other. Kundera makes this analogy painfully clear: He wanted to efface her from the photograph of his life not because he had not loved her but because he had. He had erased her, her and his love for her, he had scratched out her image until he had made it disap- pear as the party propaganda section had made Clementis disappear from the balcony where Gottwald had given his historic speech. Mirek</page><page sequence="14">114 | ERIC BERLATSKY rewrote history just like the Communist Party, like all political parties, like all peoples, like mankind. They shout that they want to shape a bet- ter future, but it's not true. The future is only an indifferent void no one cares about, but the past is filled with life, and its countenance is irritat- ing, repellent, wounding, to the point that we want to destroy or repaint it. We want to be masters of the future only for the power to change the past. We fight for access to the labs where we can retouch photos and rewrite biographies and history. (30-31) Kundera's analogizing of "real" life to the novel, and of Mirek to the novelist, at first seems to be a convenient metaphor, condemning Mirek for confusing fiction and reality. However, as we shall see, in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting Kundera resolutely blurs the line between fiction and reality and leaves us wondering what other choice Mirek has in constructing his identity. While Mirek initially seems admirable in his efforts to preserve memory, the novel here indicates that memory, or at the very least the inevitable narrativiz- ation of memory, is itself an instrument of power and potential oppression.14 It appears that the constitution of personal identity through memory-construction is as potentially dangerous as its political mirror. In this case, Kundera foregrounds the similarities between institutional history and individual memory rather than their differences. Both are open to narrative construction, with Mirek's memory revision reflecting on the micro-level the totalitarian efforts to efface history that occur in the macrocosm of the political arena. Identity and history are both, then, like the novel, artistic and per- formative creations that do not represent truth. This passage addi- tionally seems to suggest that the rewriting of one's own memory is not a liberatory counternarrative to destabilize hegemonic official accounts, but rather a universal impulse that is politically dangerous, an unavoidable abuse of power.15 Mirek's impulse to make a novel of his life is part of a tendency toward emplotment (in White's terms) that is consistently highlighted and questioned by postmodern discourse. It is, in fact, the narra- tivity of history (and fiction) that, for many, removes history from any possibility of referentiality. History, like fiction, partakes of the conventions of narrative, "selection, organization, diegesis, anecdote, temporal pacing, and emplotment" (Hutcheon 1988, 111). It is the rep- resentation of events in a narrative form, using narrative techniques.</page><page sequence="15">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 115 While history is accused of narrativization and unification by Foucault and de Certeau (among others), for some the attraction of memory is its resistance to such emplotment. For critics like Mae G. Henderson, the importance of memory is precisely in its capac- ity to lie outside narrative. In work like Henderson's study of Toni Morrison's Beloved, memories are configured as "residual images" or "rememories [Morrison's term]" (1991, 66) that lie outside the cul- tural narrative and "haunt" the possibility of coherent meaning. This is especially so in cases of extreme trauma (as in the depiction of slavery in Beloved or in the case of the Shoah) wherein events in the past have been psychoanalytically repressed and are therefore not possessed, owned, or assimilated by the subject. "'Rememory' ... is something which possesses (or haunts) one, rather than something which one possesses" (67) or reintegrates through Hegelian recollec- tion. Possession of the cultural narrative, the administration of cul- tural history, is, for Henderson, the domain of the white man, while being possessed or haunted by repressed memories is the (at least initial) role of the black woman. This notion of the return of the repressed and the self-conscious use of ghosts and hauntings has been one way of creating a binary between the emplotted history and the repressed memory. As Kathleen Brogan has discussed, the appro- priation of the metaphor of haunting and ghosts has been central in depicting repressed cultural and ethnic narratives. However, even in Henderson's understanding of "haunting," Sethe cannot gain free- dom merely by fragmenting and denying the "overemplotment" of the patriarchal inscription of her life; she must also create "an alter- nate plot structure" (Henderson 1991, 74), a "counternarrative that reconstitutes her humanity" (79), by reincorporating the repressed event (her traumatic murder of her daughter, Beloved). In this way, emplotment is not merely the realm of the official historian, it is also essential in constructing resistant subjectivity. It is the denial of the binary separation of the narrative, institu- tional, historical emplotment that represses and the individual, inas- similable memory that "haunts" and resists the initial narrative that Kundera seems careful to avoid here. As we have seen, Kundera reveals the tendency to emplot historical events even in the recesses of personal memory. If, as Kundera suggests, it is not only political parties, but all people who fight for a past they wish to "destroy or</page><page sequence="16">116 | ERIC BERLATSKY repaint," our understanding of reality can never be true but can only be the result of a struggle for power and the access to emplotment. Clementis's hat may be present as a ghost or a haunting of the official narrative, but it is also incorporated into that narrative through ret- rospective emplotment.16 In addition, Kundera dissolves the binary that separates history (external documents, emplotment, manipulat- able evidence) from memory (internal-mental, immanent, personal, witnessing, resistance to emplotment) by proposing the presence of memory-objects (photographs, journals) as part of personal memory. While postmodern and poststructural theorization has been quick to deny the potential for full referentiality in language, Roland Barthes, a poststructuralist thinker, has been "remarkably gullible" (Rugg 1997, 11) in respect to the image, and particularly the photo- graph. Although Barthes acknowledges photography's constructed- ness in its reliance on pose and perspective, he still believes in the magic of the photograph, in its status as an "emanation ... of past reality" (Barthes 1981, 88; emphasis in original). Barthes argues that photography's "force is ... superior to everything the human mind can or can have conceived to assure us of reality" (87). The seemingly transparent ability of the photograph to refer to reality seems to be a way to arrest the postmodern "withdrawal of the real" and to use memory as a bulwark against the narrative plot of history. "[P]hoto- graphs ... represent the physical . . . principle of reintegration in autobiography and photography: subject and object, self and other, body and voice" (Rugg 1997, 21). Kundera, however, effectively denaturalizes the photograph as a representation of transparent reality and as a means of reintegrating self/other binaries. First, as we have seen, photographs are seen to be, in the postmodern age, nearly as manipulatable as language and text. Clementis can be erased from a photograph just as the Jews can be erased from the written history of Europe, or African-Americans and women can be erased from the textual history of the United States. Vicki Goldberg has detailed how the computer and the Scitex machine have made the photograph as much a creative form as a representational one (cited in Shawcross 1997, 117-18). The easy accessibility of computer scanning and computerized photographic manipulation only contributes to this sense of the photograph as merely one more system of signification that does not have direct</page><page sequence="17">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 117 access to a referent. Likewise, rather than being merely a way to mimetically recover and reconstruct memories, photographs have been seen to construct and create them. "Inevitably, the line between memory and photograph blurs, with photographic-era children un- certain as to whether their memories of childhood are memories of events they witnessed or photographs they have seen" (Rugg 1997, 23). When combined with the destabilization of the referentiality of the photograph, we can then see memory itself (or at least its Hegel- ian recollection) as a creative process, not merely within the subject, but also without, through the manipulation of memory-objects. Rather than providing for the integration of a unitary subject, we find, in The Book, subjectivity built on memory as a prosthetic pro- cess, with external (and manipulatable) items like photographs and journals being indispensable in the construction of the self. While Gottwald and Hasak operate on a macro-level, manipulat- ing memory-objects like the Gottwald/Clementis photograph to re- inscribe the nation's history, Mirek does the same work on a personal level with the desire to destroy his letters to Zdena. With The Book's denial of the immanence of memory and the referentiality of both text and image, it is no longer possible to merely see memory as something that is repressed, resistant to the emplotment of official history. Rather, memory itself is a construction that takes part in the implementation of power relations. The binary separation of history and memory that we have seen Pierre Nora and others create is here substantially questioned, leaving the political efficacy of memory in resisting power similarly in question. Mirek's attempts to preserve the powers of memory against those of historical forgetting are seen to be largely textual constructions that themselves have difficulty in accessing the real. Throughout Kundera's novel, like Mirek, the characters, in- cluding Kundera himself, search for and use memory as a means of identity construction. In "Mama," Mama remembers and envisions herself as a young girl reciting a patriotic poem in 1918, celebrating the end of the Austrian Empire and the establishment of a Czechoslo- vak republic, but forgetting the last stanza of the poem. Although the audience did not realize that the poem was not over and responded with great applause, Mama, in her shame, rushed to the bathroom in despair.</page><page sequence="18">118 | ERIC BERLATSKY Her son, Karel, points out, however, that Mama's memory is faulty, a trick. Mama had already graduated by the time the great war ended, and her poem, in reality, was merely part of a Christmas pageant. Again, Kundera clearly establishes the story of the poem as a constituent of Mama's identity. Her romantic patriotism is embod- ied in this recollection; she clings to the memory despite her internal admission of its falsehood. In an effort to "write" her identity, when asked to recite the patriotic poem she recites the Christmas poem, while never acknowledging the discrepancy between her story and her recitation. Mama seems to prefer her own version of the event to the truth, or the official version of the truth, and builds her identity, her patriotism, on her version. Karel, similarly, constructs his erotic identity on a childhood memory of witnessing his mother's friend Nora naked in a spa. This image, preserved in Karel's memory, is resurrected by Mama's asser- tion that his friend Eva looks like Nora. This assertion, combined with Karel's memory of the original event, makes Eva irresistibly attractive to Karel. For Karel, both Eva and Karel's wife, Marketa, become objectified and emptied of their identity. Karel turns them into objects rather than people. While making love with them, "he felt like a great chess player who has conquered opponents simul- taneously on two chessboards. ... he couldn't help laughing and shouting: 'I'm Bobby Fischer! I'm Bobby Fischer!"' (The Book, 67). This hysterical identity-formation comes as a direct result of Karel's access to his childhood memories. Rather than providing him with a barrier against power and ideology, it becomes an implement of gendered objectification. In The Book, memory is not merely the repressed resistance to historical, objective narrative, it is also the personal construction of identity at the expense of others. Mama's nationalism and Karel's objectification of women arise directly from their emplotment or narrative construction of their memories. Later, in "Lost Letters II," Tamina attempts to create and define her own identity through the recovery of notebooks of love letters to and remembrances of her husband. Currently living in an unnamed town in the west of Europe and an escapee of the totalitarian regime in Prague, Tamina struggles to remember her husband, who died during the escape. Tamina, like Mirek, desperately wishes to recover the notebooks left in Prague, but to preserve them rather than to</page><page sequence="19">MEMORY AS FORGETTING I 119 destroy them. For Tamina, the memory of her husband is the primary constituent of her identity. Rather than fighting to rewrite the novel of her life, she is fighting not to forget it. (Or so the narrator seems to suggest. As we have seen, however, the binary separation of these two acts seems impossible.) Tamina attempts to remember her hus- band by drawing pictures of him from an old passport photo and eventually imagines superimposing his features on every man she sees. "But all these efforts only showed that her husband's image was irrevocably slipping away" (117). As the possibility of retaining, recovering, and recuperating her memory and her notebooks re- cedes, so Tamina's identity disappears. She eventually retreats from the world altogether, to the oneiric island of children. Rather than creating an identity out of the narrative of her memory, Tamina's memory slips away, and her identity along with it. In addition to the overall thematic that all people (all characters) in the novel write, construct, or narrate their own lives into a provi- sional but constructed coherence, Kundera, additionally, draws meta- fictional and explicit attention to their fictionally constructed status as well. Kundera declares, "It is a novel about Tamina, and whenever Tamina goes offstage, it is a novel for Tamina. She is its principal character and its principal audience, and all the other stories are vari- ations on her own story and meet with her life as in a mirror" (The Book, 227). This statement within the novel, in typical postmodern fashion, attempts to break the barrier between fiction and reality. Tamina is both a clearly fictional construction and a "real" audience for the rest of the novel. She is both author and reader of her own life. This metafictional dissolution and inversion of the distinction between fiction and reality is further complicated by Kundera's res- olute refusal of genre distinctions. As Kundera notes in an interview, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting contains multiple and diffuse gen- eric categories: anecdote, autobiographical narrative, critical essay on a feminist book, a fable on angels and devils, historical narrative, the dream narrative of Tamina's death, musicological reflections, his- toriopolitical commentary, and so on (1986, 76). Kundera's blending, particularly of history and autobiography with fiction and dream, works to show the impossibility of rigid genre distinctions as well as the inherent fictionalizing of reality and the inherent reality of fiction.</page><page sequence="20">120 I ERIC BERLATSKY In doing so, Kundera does not exempt himself from his group of characters seeking and fictionally constructing identity through memory. In two autobiographical narratives, taking up parts of both sections titled "Angels," Kundera relates some of his own past, his erasure from history in Communist Prague,17 his tenure as a horo- scopist for a Communist publication and lead Communist official, and his relationship to his dying father whose memory was not erased but who became incommunicable when he lost the power of language. Kundera's father, victimized by aphasia, was reduced to the enunciation of two words, "That's strange." While Kundera does not explicitly show or comment (as he often does) on how these memories constitute his own identity, his selection of them for inclu- sion in a novel about memory's power, its seduction, and its role in constituting identity clearly asks us to read him via these anecdotes. Kundera replaces a narrative in which he was "a man erased from history" (The Book, 84), with his own account of his life. Like Mama, who chooses the memory of the poem; Karel, who chooses the mem- ory of Nora; Tamina, who "recollects" the memory of Pavel; Mirek, who wishes to erase Zdena from his palette of memories; and Artie Spiegelman, who constructs himself through his father's memories, Kundera chooses to show us his marginalization and effacement as a person and as a writer, as well as his relationship with his father and his affection for modern classical music. Kundera's identity, for the reader if not for him, is clearly constructed from these selected memories. In addition, Kundera's comments that all the stories of the novel are variations or reflections of Tamina's story reduce (or proclaim) his own story (presumably placed in what would traditionally be called real history or autobiographical memory) to be merely a vari- ation on hers. Her foregrounded fictionality does not subordinate her historiopolitical importance. Rather, she is the center around which the autobiographical, historical, and political narratives re- volve. In addition, Kundera's assertion that novelistic characters are, on one hand, "experimental selves" for the author (implying an auto- biographical element in the most fabulous of fictional creations) (1986, 31) and, on the other hand, simultaneously nothing more than a conglomeration of words18 that define their character, further complicates and subverts the reality/fiction boundary. If Tamina is</page><page sequence="21">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 121 simultaneously a fictional character, a reader, an experimental self for Kundera, and a conglomeration of words, the separation of auto- biography and fiction, reality and language, truth and narrative become impossible to maintain. Where Barbara Foley identifies the difference between truth narratives and fictional narratives in their cognitive reception by the reader, in which the reader decodes texts identified in these categories in different ways, Kundera works hard to subvert these cognitive differences by mixing genres, by fictional- izing himself, and by giving the fictionally constructed and narrated characters privilege over (in Tamina's case) historical narrative.19 Where personal memory, at the opening of The Book, seems to be a way of safeguarding, verifying, or even resisting false history, by the end it seems clearly to be a performative construction, an act of repressive power (in the cases of Mirek, Mama, Karel, and Tamina) and, in many ways, has no concrete connection to the reality it pur- ports to represent as a reparative to the effacement of history. In this way the self-reflexive, relativist use of metafictional technique and postmodernist assumptions makes it impossible to maintain the binary that Mirek (and at times the Kundera-narrator) proposes at the outset. Memory, like history, is (at least partially) a construction, prone to fictionalization that may provide a counternarrative to the official institutional history, but also may contribute to the loss of meaning and effacement of referentiality that Mirek seems bent on preventing in "Lost Letters." SPIEGELMAN AND POSTMODERN MEMORY If the effectiveness of Mirek's attempt to fight power through mem- ory is undercut by the relativizing of memory itself through Kun- dera's postmodern aesthetic, it is important to note the central role that personal and communal memory have played in the politically radical arm of postmodern thought. Because history is always writ- ten by the victors, the discourse of official history has become a central object of postmodern denaturalization (i.e., the systematic revelation of historical discourse as text, not truth). In this view, per- sonal memory is often taken to be the reparative for institutional his- tory. If institutional history is the perpetrator and perpetuator of a</page><page sequence="22">122 | ERIC BERLATSKY "master narrative" that marginalizes and confines large portions of a society, the localized and relative truth of personal (and commu- nal) memory is often seen to be a means of reconstituting identity and fighting repressive power. Some cultural studies theorists often choose to stop their analyses with the denaturalization of prevalent modes of essentializing thought through discursive analysis, while others champion the reclamation of lost voices and the reconstitution of counternarratives. While these projects are indispensable in any attempt to destabilize the discourses of bourgeois liberalism that still administer hegemonic power (patriarchy, whiteness, heteronorma- tivity), it is also important to consider how postmodernism, if taken to its logical conclusion, can present a radical relativism that may lead to political paralysis (as we can see in the destabilization of Mirek's attempts to fight hegemonic power). Where the localized, relativistic truths of personal memory may be championed as coun- terdiscursive in one context, their relativism and mutability may elsewhere be seen as oppressive. Jonathan Boyarin has observed how the postmodern attempt to delegitimate "universal history" has, at times, led to the reification of memory and the understanding of history and memory as "funda- mentally different modes of relating to the past, with the Jews as a favorite case of a 'people of memory' in opposition to history" (1992, 93). While personal memory is known to be prone to error, forgetful- ness, and to be partially constituted of creative imagination, it never- theless maintains for some, particularly in the case of a traumatic event like the Holocaust, some authority over the proliferation of tex- tuality and electronic media so prevalent in the postmodern age.20 It is nevertheless a given in the postmodern age that no modes of representation and identity formation have inherent authority and that the valorization of memory, as Boyarin suggests, may be a reification that has political ramifications. This foregrounds the diffi- culty for socially and politically oppressed peoples to participate in their own coherent and stable identity formation and representation through memory in an age identified as postmodern. As we have seen, it is often the case that oppressed groups work to re-present, reincorporate, and renarrate traumatic events that would seem to lie outside the symbolic register (i.e., seem to be beyond signification or impossible to narrate).21 The Shoah, or the genocidal elimination of</page><page sequence="23">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 123 the Jews during the Second World War, undoubtedly qualifies as a traumatic event that would seem to lie outside the possibility of narration and the plenitude of meaning. Art Spiegelman has, indeed, referred to the Shoah as "the central trauma of the Twentieth Cen- tury" (quoted in LaCapra 1998, 140). While the traumatic event often leads to the repression of memories of the event,22 as we have seen it also leads to the attempt to control, narrate, and give meaning to the event through recollection and narration.23 This may help to explain the collective Jewish impulse to "witness" through memory the events of the Holocaust. This impulse is illustrated by the Yale Fortunoff Collection of approximately 3,700 survival testimonies and the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation, which plans to record the tes- timonies of approximately 50,000 survivors (LaCapra 1998, 11). As Dominick LaCapra discusses, these testimonies of personal memory serve as a source for official history without exhausting their potential for more imaginative identity construction. This also illustrates some anxiety about the possibility that the Holocaust may be forgotten once its primary witnesses disappear. As Michael Staub observes: [T]hey reflect a general anxiety over the impending death of all concen- tration camp survivors and their living memories. When they are gone, we will have mountains of written texts, videotapes, films, recordings and other evidence. But the actual voices will be lost forever. How, then, to approximate the authority of the oral in a world increasingly suspi- cious of and unconvinced by written evidence? (1995, 35) Staub expresses a postmodern skepticism as to the mimetic possibilities of textual signification, but posits the oral and the remembered as a possible reparative to the official history of textual signification. The difficulty of maintaining this binary is clear in the thousands of memories committed to paper, audiotapes, and video- tapes in an attempt to approximate a supposed immanence and referentiality that the oral represents for some.24 The adoption of a prosthetic memory (as Mirek and Tamina do in The Book) indicates the difficulty, if not impossibility, of "touching the world" in repre- senting the experience of the Shoah. As the presence of personal memories becomes past textual history, the line between these two hypothetically opposed terms dissolves. While collective memory</page><page sequence="24">124 | ERIC BERLATSKY and its traditions theoretically survive in the continuous present as long as the community survives, the almost obsessive collection of survival testimonies, and the commitment of them to textual repre- sentations, indicates a communal anxiety about the possibility of maintaining such a collective identity without the tools of history to "fix" and eternalize the past. As Sander Gilman has shown, in the nineteenth century Jewish identity had been constructed from without by scientific discourses that constructed "Jew" as a race rather than as a religion. Eastern Jews were seen as Oriental, Western Jews were often classified as black, and both groups were seen as, irredeemably, a mongrel race, a hybrid and contaminating mixture. Likewise, Jews were identified by their flat feet, their big noses, their proclivity for sexually transmitted diseases, and above all, for men, by their circumcised penises. As Gilman explores, the traumatized male member marked the Jew as not only racialized, but also feminized and pathologized. In this sense, the figure of the Jew becomes an ideal site for the postmodern discursive denaturalization of the social text of nineteenth- (and early twentieth-) century discourse that posed scientific positivism as a master narrative. Gilman himself repeatedly has done the work of exposing the racializing, feminizing, and pathologizing discourses precisely as social text rather than as scientific truth, showing how the white, European, Christian, patriarchal dominant was able to construct an identity for Jews accepted by a large percentage of Euro- peans in the years preceding World War II (and after). In the wake of this denaturalization of imposed Jewish identity, collective memory has become increasingly important in reconstruct- ing a Jewish community. If it has become common to de-essentialize notions of "formal-race" in order to subvert oppression, an adversion to "historical race" has become necessary.25 While biological pseudo- scientific notions of racial difference (couched in positivist or scien- tific discourse) have been exposed as social construction, the material effects of those discourses have helped create a community with com- mon experiences, bound together not only by shared experiences and traditions, but also by shared persecution. While ascription from without is still a fact of racist, imperialist, and sexist cultures, the postmodern age has also increasingly allowed for people to, in</page><page sequence="25">MEMORY AS FORGETTING I 125 Morrison's words, "choose their identities. Now people choose to be Black. They used to be born Black. That's not true anymore" (quoted in Brogan 1998, 12; emphasis in original).26 Replacing the pseudoscientific conflation of racial and religious identifications, Jews (and other oppressed groups) have often turned to shared col- lective memory to reinscribe their own subjectivity. Again, however, we must observe that such reinscription is neither ideologically free from pitfalls nor unmediated in its access to and construction of a shared past. As Marc Ellis has observed, the reincorporation of a traumatic memory to build a primary identity is not necessarily liberatory or advisable in constructing a personal or religious identity. Rather, Ellis observes how it was only in the wake of Israel's 1967 war that "Jews articulated for the first time both the extent of Jewish suffering during the Holocaust and the significance of Jewish empowerment in Israel" (quoted in Rothberg 1994, 680). This in turn, claims Ellis, began to give Jewish consciousness a pri- mary identity of "innocence and redemption," building Jewish iden- tity out of the role of "innocent victims" and building the identity of Israel to be one of "messianic redemption" (Rothberg 1994, 680).27 As in the case of Kundera's novel, Ellis sees the Jewish people (or at least many of them) choosing the traumatic memory to define themselves, activating a "legitimating apparatus for Jewish chauvinism and for the Jewish state, since, within its terms, we cannot acknowledge Jews themselves victimizers, either as individuals or as a collective" (Rothberg 1994, 680-81). Like Kundera, Ellis sees the construction of identity through memory (or its recollection) as a potential abuse of power to oppress others. Memory is not merely used to create a collective consciousness or to fight off the erasure of history by Holo- caust revisionists, but also to legitimate Zionist aggression, particu- larly, for Michael Rothberg (680-83), in the arena of Israeli/Palestine relations. Memory is not an innocent remembering nor is it merely in its historical inaccuracy that it can be liberatory or dangerous; it is also a means of constructing identity that can constitute an abuse of power. It is in this context that Spiegelman embarks on his own repre- sentation of Vladek's survival testimony. Like Kundera, he partakes of a postmodern aesthetic that places the truth-value of memory,</page><page sequence="26">126 | ERIC BERLATSKY history, and identity into question, never claiming for himself the historical accuracy of truth telling that might allow for the co-option of his work into essentialist constructions of history or Jewish iden- tity. At the same time, he is committed to representing history in all of its specificity and factuality in an effort (among other things) to prevent revisionist effacement. Like Kundera, Spiegelman uses multiple generic conventions in order to separate his work from a univocal survivor's testimony or a historical document. Spiegelman's book is biography, autobiography, comic book, animal fable, oral history, and graphic novel all at once. As commentators on Maus never fail to observe, Spiegelman does not represent his father or anyone else in the world of Maus as people, but rather as anthropomorphic animals. Although the books are labeled "Holocaust/Autobiography," the supposedly real represen- tations of people are drawn in comic-book form and as animals. The Jews are mice, the Nazis are cats, Americans are friendly dogs, French are frogs, Poles are pigs, and Gypsies are, of course, moths. Spiegelman, in this way, both literalizes and denaturalizes the stereo- typical Nazi (and common European) assessment of Jews as vermin and disease carriers in order to portray the anthropomorphic mice as real people (despite their ironic appearance).28 It is also true that he does not attempt to humanize many other groups, particularly the Nazis, who remain predatory throughout. In displaying all the groups as comic-book animals, however, he is sure to distance his Holocaust narrative from any claim to actual truth. Indeed, when Maus was listed on the "Fiction" side of the New York Times best-seller list, Spiegelman complained, ironically admitting the generic prob- lematic that Maus creates: If your list were divided into literature and nonliterature, I could grace- fully accept the compliment as intended, but to the extent that "fiction" indicates that the work isn't factual, I feel a bit queasy.... The borderland between fiction and nonfiction has been fertile ter- ritory for some of the most potent contemporary writing.... I shudder to think how David Duke-if he could read-would respond to seeing a carefully researched work based closely on my father's memories of life in Hitler's Europe and in the death camps classified as fiction. I know that by delineating people with animal heads I've raised problems of taxonomy for you. Could you consider adding a special "nonfiction/mice" category to your list? (quoted in LaCapra 1998, 145)</page><page sequence="27">MEMORY AS FORGETTING i 127 Spiegelman here displays both an allegiance to history as factual, as a political necessity to refute the David Dukes of the world, and an acknowledgment that his book is not and cannot be completely non- fiction. He has created a hybrid category29 that relies on identity, history, and memory and also visually exposes them as essentialist notions. Spiegelman's allegiance to historical accuracy is referenced by his care- ful reconstruction of people, places, and events. In an interview, he ac- knowledges this attempt: "Now, my father's not necessarily a reliable witness and I never presumed that he was. So, as far as I could cor- roborate anything he said, I did-which meant on occasion talking to friends and to relatives and also doing as much reading as I could" (Brown 1988,3). Artie even asks another survivor, Pavel, for clarification on details after his father's death (Maus II, 47), and includes repre- sentations of sketches by Vladek to clarify his oral testimony (Maus, 110). Nevertheless, accompanying Spiegelman's efforts at historical reconstruction are self-reflexive acknowledgments of the futility of this attempt. In another interview, he observes, "essentially, the num- ber of layers between an event and somebody trying to apprehend that event through time and intermediaries is like working with flick- ering shadows. It's all you can hope for" (quoted in Brown 1988, 98). Indeed, Spiegelman's text both embodies and refutes positivist scientific definitions of the Jew. Maus combines two of the most threatening and overdetermined aspects of the Jewish stereotype, the Mauscheln and the Mischling. Although Spiegelman clearly uses the German word for mice in his title, he also clearly draws on Mauscheln, "the speaking of German with a Yiddish accent, intona- tion, or vocabulary" (Gilman 1991, 88). Clearly, Vladek's speech rep- resents a version of Mauscheln, taken by anti-Semites as a sign of difference and duplicity, a hidden language (88, also see 10-37), but turned here into a way of provisionally recovering a positive Jewish identity. In addition, the once derogatory concept of Mischling, the discursive construction of Jews as a hybrid, impure, and mongrel race (Gilman 1995, 14-15), is positively transformed into Spiegel- man's hybrid, literary/popular, image/text, fiction/history creation. In this way Spiegelman is able to partake in the postmodern denatu- ralization of master narratives, revealing the ways in which the body and the voice are discursively constructed in service of Nazism and broader anti-Semitism.</page><page sequence="28">128 | ERIC BERLATSKY Further, Maus is not merely the story of Vladek's survival, it is also the story of Artie's telling of that survival (and includes, partic- ularly in Maus II, a third narrative of how Artie survives the telling). In elaborating these narrative frames, Spiegelman provides himself with additional opportunities to question the truth-value of memory and the results of constructing identity out of memory, even as he relates Vladek's story in comic form. At the opening of Maus II, Artie discusses how he will draw his wife, Francoise, with her, emphasiz- ing the fictionality of his production: ARTIE: What kind of animal should I make you? FRANGOISE: Huh? A mouse, of course! ARTIE: But you're French! FRAN(OISE: Well... How about the bunny rabbit? ARTIE: Nah, too sweet and gentle. FRAN(OISE: Hmmph. ARTIE: I mean the French in general. Let's not forget the centuries of anti-Semitism... I mean, how about the Dreyfus affair? The Nazi collaborators! The- FRAN(OISE Okay! But if you're a mouse, I ought to be a mouse too. I converted didn't I? (Maus II, 11) This passage foregrounds the difficulty or impossibility of assigning essentialist racial features to an individual, but it also shows Spiegelman's representational power. The historiography of Maus is always presented through Spiegelman's representations, rep- resentations that carry the tremendous power of allegorical iconog- raphy in addition to his own choice (from his father's choices) of what "facts" to represent and how to represent them. In the scene quoted above, Artie experiments with several sketches of Franqoise, literarily illustrating the power of imagistic representation. Artie (both the character and the author) controls the ways in which we perceive Francoise (and the other historical figures in Maus), much as anti-Semitic discourse controlled perceptions of Jews in the years preceding the Shoah. Spiegelman's self-reflexive portrayal of this problematic helps provisionalize the memories he shows us. Particu- larly in Maus II, Artie begins to show an intense realization of the problems inherent in historical production:</page><page sequence="29">tT -OVREP FENCH' o WELL tiQW No90T L e?:r a.u^s wwa%; Yr aL iwMoo 5WC? bNp 6etTLiC A .

I feel so inadequate trying to reconstruct a reality that was worse than my darkest dreams. And trying to do it as a comic strip! I guess I bit off more than I can chew. Maybe I ought to forget the whole thing. There's so much I'll never be able to understand or visualize. I mean reality is too complex for comics. So much has to be left out or distorted. FRAN4OISE: Just keep it honest, honey. ARTIE: See what I mean. In real life you'd never have let me talk this long without interrupting. (Maus II, 16) The metafictional self-reflexiveness of this passage is extraordi- nary. Like Kundera, Spiegelman here foregrounds the literary pro- duction of his supposedly representational/mimetic work. Not only does Artie admit the inherent pitfalls in narrativizing history, he also subverts the binary of reality/fiction by having the fictional Artie comment on his own status as literary production. "If this was real life," he says, highlighting the fact that, of course, this representation of life is not life, while at the same time narrating the impossibility of representing life accurately. These metafictional references to the con- structedness of the text of Maus increase in Maus II, with the writing continually drawing attention to itself as writing. Another example occurs when Artie goes to see his "shrink" Pavel. "His place is overrun with stray dogs and cats. Can I mention this or does it completely louse up my metaphor?" (43). Spiegelman acknowledges the possi- bility of the metaphor getting beyond his control and freely admits its limits. His translation of memory results in unavoidable inaccuracy and highlights the metaphorical fictionality of his representations. Even the first volume of Maus contains self-reflexive attempts to illustrate the constructed nature of Spiegelman's historical project, most apparently in the comic within a comic of the autobiographical "Prisoner on the Hell Planet," a short, "obscure underground comic book" (99) that he had written in 1972. The comic presents the suicide of Spiegelman's mother, along with his own self-involved interpreta- tion of events in which he blames his mother for his own emotional death. This comic-book depiction of stylized human figures illustrates the subjective constructedness of Spiegelman's younger work, while reflecting on the depiction of the animals in Maus. The sudden depic- tion of stylized human figures in a narrative about anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="31">MEMORY AS FORGETTING 1 131 mice highlights the fact that there is a human writing/drawing the mouse Artie, who in turn wrote "Prisoner on the Hell Planet," which, at the same time, was written by the real human Spiegelman. This blurring of the distinction between reality and fiction helps to prevent the reader from ignoring the historiographic construction of Maus, despite its seemingly univocal presentation of Vladek's experiences. In addition, both "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" and Maus II con- tain realistic photographs of the characters involved, emphasizing once more the fictional constructedness of the text itself (Maus II, 134). Although here the photograph seems to be meant to provide a "reality effect," the stylized, sketched hand that holds the photo- graph in the comic helps to contribute to the sense that it is more of a "fantasy of realism" than a clear touching of the world. If a con- structed, drawn human hand is holding the picture, which is in turn part of a comic held by an anthropomorphic mouse in a comic that is held by a (presumably human) reader, the layers of reality and con- struction become truly vertiginous. The photograph itself does not provide us with any guarantee of referentiality, especially given the family's apparent happiness in the photo. This happiness is belied by the mother's suicide and the son's recent release from a mental hospital in the mise-en-scene. The posed and constructed nature of the photograph is itself revealed as a fiction. Later in the book, pho- tographs themselves are shown as drawn mouse figures, as the real is replaced by the constructed (115) before returning to photorealism in the realistic photograph of Vladek that appears near the close of the comic (134). In this way, history and memory are self-reflexively questioned even as they are presented. Where memory might initially be seen as a stable and clear way to fight social and political oppression, it soon becomes destabilized and questionable in Spiegelman's post- modern self-reflexivity. As we have seen, essentialist racial identity is questioned in the body of the text in similar ways, but is further de- stabilized by the narrative itself. Throughout Vladek's narrative, there are times when the Jews put on pig masks in order to disguise them- selves as Poles and escape Nazi persecution. As Vladek reminds us, this is easier for those without stereotypical distinguishing racial mark- ers, as some mice are depicted with tails, while others are not.30 This use of animal masks makes an initial foray into the de-essentializing</page><page sequence="32">r14R C FSP. 4' Figure 2.

Nevertheless, this use of animal masks is initially consistent with the metaphors of the narrative and does not exceed their boundaries. Later, in Maus II, Spiegelman begins to more self- reflexively exhibit postmodern notions of the dynamic performativ- ity and constructedness of identity. Chapter 2, "Auschwitz (Time Flies)," finds Artie depicted as a man with a mouse mask. Television interviewers and his therapist are depicted, similarly, as men with animal masks in this framing section, where Artie is interviewed about the first volume of Maus for television and pays a visit to his therapist. Humans then seem to choose their identity (in the way we have seen Morrison suggest) by wearing masks, while simultane- ously asking Artie what masks he assigns them. One reporter in a mouse mask asks, "If your book was about Israeli Jews what kind of animal would you draw?" (Maus II, 42). This attention to the performative construction of identity takes place in what is undoubtedly the book's most self-aware moment. Spiegelman depicts Artie worrying about the mass-market co-option of his Holocaust narrative. Artie sits at his drawing table, in front of television interviewers, discussing his own commercial success while sitting atop a pile of mouse corpses. Clearly, Artie is concerned about what Fredric Jameson might call the commodification of his art. The sense that he may be faking authenticity without realizing it, or that there can be no separation of the money-making commodity and its artistic and social significance, finds Spiegelman pointing resolutely to the constructedness of his artistic creation and the constructed- ness of himself, wearing the mouse mask for commercial gain. That this commercial gain is built on the deaths of millions of dead "mice," or Jews, is horrifically and vividly depicted. The simultaneously humor- ous but threatening depiction of the American advertiser offering a licensing deal for Artie vests ("Maus. You've read the book now buy the vest!" [42]) depicts the postmodern tendency for binaries to become nonexistent. Not only are signifier/signified and reality/ fiction barriers destroyed, but the differences between commercial product and high art are self-reflexively dissolved as well. Similarly, Spiegelman is more careful to depict the technological construction of his text in Maus II, illustrating not only Vladek telling his story into Artie's tape recorder, but also Artie listening to the tapes (47) and</page><page sequence="34">134 | ERIC BERLATSKY sitting at his drawing table in an attempt to translate oral narrative and recording into a comic-book narrative. Finally, as Arlene Wilner points out, even Vladek's oral narrative is specifically configured not only as history but also as "story" (a coupling that is unavoidable in the definitions of history provided by de Certeau, Foucault, and White), subject to the perils of emplotment that have been seen to separate history from a purely referential role. Here we can see that Staub's invocation to "approximate the author- ity of the oral" is, at least somewhat, misguided. The very transfor- mation of life into narrative, even without the comic-book format and secondhand testimony of Artie, is a construction that asserts mean- ing where none, necessarily, exists. When Vladek closes his narration by saying, "We [Vladek and Anja] were both very happy, and lived happy, happy, ever after" (Maus II, 136), the reader can only read this as a fairy tale construction of actual events, a violent unification of diverse elements. From reading Artie's frames, specifically "The Pris- oner on the Hell Planet," the reader knows that Anja commits suicide and that Vladek's later life is far from a fairy tale. His inclination to close his narrative at the end of his Holocaust experiences illustrates the danger of narrativizing reality, despite the seeming unavoid- ability of doing so. Like Kundera's Mirek, Vladek is seen to want to control his memory through narrative recollection. Just as Mirek attempts to erase Zdena's life, Vladek attempts to erase the trials of Anja, and simultaneously completely erases his second wife, Mala, from his life's narrative. It is only through Artie, whose narration is equally questionable, that we learn of Mala at all. By refusing to allow Vladek a univocal presentation of events, Spiegelman is careful not to allow traumatic memory to define Vladek, and the Jewish people in general, as victims who remain innocent. Vladek, through Artie's eyes, is seen to be a racist and a miser, someone neither Artie nor Francoise can stand. What is more, the text refuses to allow the Holocaust as an excuse for domineering and occasionally hate-filled behavior. ARTIE: I used to think the war made him that way. MALA: Fah! I went through the camps. All our friends went through the camps. Nobody is like him! ARTIE: Mm. It's something that worries me about the book I'm doing</page><page sequence="35">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 135 about him. In some ways he's just like the racist caricature of the miserly old Jew. (Maus, 131-32) Here Spiegelman shows a refusal to allow Vladek only the role of victim, while at the same time indicating anxiety over the possible narratives available to him. Vladek may be a miser, but Spiegelman does not want to participate in anti-Semitic discourses that would define Vladek as a caricature of the miserly Jew. Instead, all he can do is draw attention to the problem.31 Vladek's racism is especially telling in showing the dangers of constructing narratives out of memory. When Vladek balks at the prospect of picking up a black hitchhiker and inscribes him with familiar stereotypes, it is clear that Vladek's memory does not pro- vide him with a sense of communality for those similarly oppressed, but rather gives him a sense of entitlement. FRANGOISE: That's outrageous! How can you, of all people, be such a racist! You talk about blacks the way Nazis talked about the Jews! VLADEK: Ach! I thought really you are more smart than this, Francoise. It's not even to compare, the Shvartzers and the Jews! (Maus II, 99) Here the denaturalization of essentialized racial identities for Jews is not extended to the "Shvartzers," as Vladek calls them. Instead, the reconstruction of Jewish identity, built partially on the Shoah, reconstructs the Jew as white, as the black man's "other." While Jews themselves were often configured as black, equivalent to those of African descent in nineteenth-century racialist discourse,32 this discursive transformation of Jews from black to white allows for the transformation of the Arab in Palestine into an "other," rather than a sibling in racial oppression.33 As Edward Said has pointed out in multiple contexts, Zionism may be a positive site of communal identity formation for the Jew, but it remains a site of racist inscrip- tion for the Arab inhabitants of Israel. The Arabs are seen as "out- landish, strange, hostile" (Said 1990, 216), just as Vladek sees the black hitchhiker. Although Spiegelman may not be referencing this analogy directly in this scene, as Rothberg suggests (1994, 682), he is undoubtedly highlighting the discursive production of racial</page><page sequence="36">136 | ERIC BERLATSKY identity and the ways in which identity can be constructed at the expense of others. That memory is seen throughout Maus as a pri- mary identifier for Jews highlights its role in constructing new nar- ratives that threaten to inscribe "others." In this sense Jonathan Boyarin's advice to avoid the construction of identity based on place (specifically Zionist Israel) and replace it with identification based on memory is subtly delegitimated. It is, at least partially, the recon- struction of a narrative based on memory that allows the (over)iden- tification with the state of Israel. As Kundera comments on the irony of Mirek exerting his mem- ory's power onto Zdena, Spiegelman, through his metafictional and postmodernist techniques, continually draws attention to the construc- tedness of Vladek's narrative and its potential use as an instrument of power. Vladek's erasure of Anja's suffering in the post-Holocaust years and his one-sided portrayal of Anja counterbalance the narra- tive of the resourceful survivor of the primary narrative. At the same time, Spiegelman refuses to represent himself in a completely posi- tive light, showing Artie's lack of appreciation for his marriage and his complicity with the commercialization of the Shoah. In addition to these problematics, as we have observed, Spiegelman continually foregrounds his story as text and not as truth, showing, like Kundera, that memory, history, and identity are all largely constructions that are always part of ideological/political discourse and oppression, whether this is conscious or not. KUNDERA, SPIEGELMAN, AND THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGY While sitting on his psychiatrist's couch in Maus II, Artie Spiegelman quotes Samuel Beckett: "Samuel Beckett once said: 'Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness."' He follows this by stating, "On the other hand, he said it" (Maus II, 45). Here Spiegelman offers the double bind that the possibility of political action encounters in the postmodern world, particularly through memory-work and historical representation. Textual proliferation both foregrounds relativistic historiography and indicates the futil- ity of attempting social change. "[L]ook at how many books have already been written about the Holocaust. What's the point? People</page><page sequence="37">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 137 haven't changed. Maybe they need a newer, bigger Holocaust," says Artie (Maus II, 45). Artie's statements deny Mirek's notion that per- sonal memory can be a social and political bulwark against political oppression, and yet, like Beckett, Artie makes them. In addition, as both Kundera and Spiegelman show in their hybridized texts of fact and fiction, of memory and creation, memory cannot be seen as a security blanket against the master narrative of history, because memory itself dynamically creates history and is an implement of power or ideology. While Mirek, Mama, Karel, and Tamina cling to pasts that are at least partially of their own creation, Kundera, in a later essay, acknowledges the impossibility of main- taining the memory/forgetting binary: "We do not know [reality] as it is in the present, in the moment when it's happening, when it is. The present moment is unlike the memory of it. Remembering is not the negative of forgetting. Remembering is a form of forgetting" (1993, 128). As Kundera points out, and as the characters of The Book and Maus illustrate, memory is not inviolable, it is a series of selections and erasures that defines it as much by what it is not as by what it is. These selections and erasures earmark memory, like identity and history, as a construction. Although it is true that historical events have political, social, and bodily repercussions, it is also true that the reconstruction of those events also have sociopolitical consequences. There is no essential memory that lies outside the constructedness of discourse, at least according to the postmodern aesthetic that the work of both Kundera and Spiegelman suggest. In "The Border," the final section of The Book, Kundera comments on the problem that this simultaneously postmodern (in its "withdrawal from the real") and political viewpoint presents. "It takes so little, so infinitely little, for someone to find himself on the other side of the border, where every- thing-love, convictions, faith, history-no longer has meaning" (281). On one side of the border, as Kundera configures it, is the radi- cally postmodern,34 a world where there can be no meaning, referent, or political commitment whatsoever. The other side, however, is equally problematic. The assigning of meaning, love, faith, history, and even personal memory inevitably leads to a perpetuation of ide- ology, or in Kunderan terms, an idyll. As many Kundera critics have noted, the figure of the closed circle, the "circle dance," or the "idyll"</page><page sequence="38">138 | ERIC BERLATSKY shown throughout The Book, indicates Kundera's distaste for univo- cal meaning, the single belief of the circle dance. For Kundera, those who put their faith in communism were victims of ideological essen- tialism, as are the girls in "The Angels" who assign a single (ironi- cally semiotic and deconstructive) meaning to lonesco's Rhinoceros. They dance in a solipsistic circle, trusting in the security of their ide- ology and meaning. Kundera acknowledges the appeal of essentialist ideological discourse ("I too once danced in a ring" [The Book, 91]) but refuses it, just as he refuses a postmodern loss of meaning that is not politically engaged. Like Spiegelman, Kundera follows Beckett in saying something, despite the acknowledgment that whatever narra- tive is constructed will have tenuous ties to reality and will have ide- ological repercussions. This is perhaps most clear when Kundera identifies the idea of "justice for all" as an idyll, an impossible dream: I emphasize: idyll and for all, because all human beings have always aspired to an idyll, to that garden where nightingales sing, to that realm of harmony where the world does not rise up as a stranger against man and man against other men, but rather where the world and all men are shaped from one and the same matter. There, everyone is a note in a sublime Bach fugue, and anyone who refuses to be one is a mere useless and meaningless dot that need only be caught and crushed between thumb and finger like a flea. (The Book, 11) In typical postmodern fashion, Kundera denies any totalizing narrative, even a master narrative that is premised on equality (like that of liberal humanism), because, like liberal humanism, the closed circle of the idyll will not only exclude but also "crush" those it does not encompass. The postmodern double bind is also evident, how- ever. If a world where man does not rise against other men is merely a master narrative, then violence and oppression themselves remain inevitable. Both Kundera and Spiegelman acknowledge and emphasize the possible ideological complicity of their hybridized historical fictions. They do so not to offer their own myths or "idylls" to live by, it seems, but rather to posit "the world as ambiguity, . . . not a single absolute truth but a welter of contradictory truths . . . to have as one's only certainty the wisdom of uncertainty" (1986, 6-7). Kundera, in particular, does not allow this "wisdom of uncertainty" to lead to political paralysis, but instead seems to offer uncertainty itself as</page><page sequence="39">MEMORY AS FORGETTING I 139 something of a political goal. In this quotation and elsewhere, Kun- dera seems to conclude that it is certainty itself, not the particular ideological formations of totalitarian communism or fascism, that leads to oppression, and that the foregrounding of epistemological uncertainty, postmodernism's bailiwick, destabilizes (without elimi- nating) the possibility of the co-opting of knowledge, memory, his- tory, and identity for and by power. It is this construction of instability and uncertainty as an ethics itself that has permeated recent efforts to establish poststructuralism and postmodern fiction as ethical, despite its usual resistance to con- crete political positions. As Simon Critchley explores in The Ethics of Deconstruction (1999), Derridean poststructuralism is ethical in its insistence on seeing the "Other" (that which is outside) as "other" (incomprehensible, irreducibly different) rather than as a means of constructing meaning. Andrew Gibson likewise sees the ethic of postmodern fiction in its insistence on maintaining alterity rather than attempting to explain or make sense of its subject matter. For Gibson the ethics of postmodern fiction lies in its ability to "indi- cate[ ] the finitude of ontological discourse, its lack of purchase on the real" (1999, 63). As Charles Molesworth observes, however, Kundera's commit- ment to the wisdom of uncertainty itself constitutes something of an idyll, a unifying belief, and that is the belief in the novel itself. As Kundera asserts, "The world of one single Truth and the relative, ambiguous world of the novel are molded of entirely different sub- stances. Totalitarian Truth excludes relativity, doubt, questioning; it can never accommodate what I would call the spirit of the novel" (1986, 14; emphasis in original). For Kundera, it is not necessarily what is contained in a novel's narrative that contains liberatory opportunities, but rather the multi- vocal heterogeneity of perspective that the novel's form encompasses that creates a relativism that leads to wisdom. Throughout his novels and his books of essays, The Art of the Novel and Testaments Betrayed, Kundera continually offers the novel as that which offers the wisdom of uncertainty, that which poses questions rather than answers them. In doing so, he tries to, more or less successfully, occupy the border between univocal meaning and meaningless chaos, while paradoxi- cally promoting his own ideology of politically committed uncertainty.</page><page sequence="40">140 | ERIC BERLATSKY Spiegelman is less confident about the power of his text to have any political or social utility. Spiegelman, as we have seen, fore- grounds not only the ideological atrocities of fascism, but also the ideological dangers of reconstructed Jewish memory. In doing so, he does not seem to offer uncertainty itself as a solution, but, in Maus at times, to withdraw from representation altogether. While The Book ends on "The Border," offering an uncertain balancing between mean- ing and meaninglessness, the Maus books end with a statement of the inadequacy of representation. In the final panels, Vladek lies in bed and tells Artie, "I'm tired from talking, Richieu, and it's enough stories for now" (Maus II, 136). Richieu is the name of Artie's brother, killed during the Holocaust, whose story was never completed. At the same time, Spiegelman, via Vladek, seems to proclaim the inade- quacy of all stories, not only to explain the Holocaust, but to repre- sent them as well. Where Kundera offers an alternative to history in the novel itself (and the history of the European novel) and its poten- tial for multivocal, dialogic discourse, Spiegelman, at the close of Maus, seems less willing to offer an alternative at all. While providing a voice for Vladek, Spiegelman is never sure what political and social purpose this postmodern construction of self-reflexive narration can serve. Joshua Brown offers, "Spiegelman has created a history that is compelling in its portrayal of the Holocaust and in its consistent analysis of the hazards and holes in the reconstruction of history" (1988, 108). In the end, however, Spiegelman seems unsure of the pos- sibility of avoiding the "hazards and holes," even if these ideological pitfalls are consistently analyzed. The Book finds a measure of narra- tive comfort in its position on "The Border" between meaning and meaninglessness. Maus never offers us that comfort. The pairing of these two texts then illustrates two prevailing con- temporary readings of postmodernity in general and postmodernist fiction in particular. While critics like Gibson and Critchley find a certain ethics in the "withdrawal from the real" (similar to Kundera's "wisdom of uncertainty") found in works that stress the difficulty in attempting to find a real outside the text, others are concerned that the abandonment of ontology or a stress on the "finitude of ontolog- ical discourse" places postmodernist works outside of social and his- torical praxis. In Writing History, Writing Trauma, Dominick LaCapra questions the poststructural historiography of critics like White and</page><page sequence="41">MEMORY AS FORGETTING I 141 Frank Ankersmit, precisely because of their incapacity to acknowl- edge the real historical events (like the Holocaust) that are so cen- tral to communal identity formation or radical politics precisely as real or theoretically independent of retrospective textual construc- tion. While Kundera's and Spiegelman's novels refuse to allow an un- critical acceptance of memory as the real, and presence as opposed to the constructedness of the past through historical discourse, they also underline, through Mirek's and Artie's marshalling of memory against power, the dangers of a complete relativizing of the real or a removal of the real into the realm of the sublime or the impossible to attain. Both authors' works stress the importance of maintaining a sense of the true and the factual while acknowledging and fore- grounding how history and memory both become deeply textual sto- ries without direct access to truth. In doing so, they stress the true importance of the debate over history and memory in the postmod- ern age. While it is possible to construct a hypothetical ethics in radical alterity and the sublimity of uncertainty, when true events or historical facticity is essential in constructing a communal identifica- tion or a radical politics, such uncertainty seems unsatisfactory. If the "wisdom of uncertainty" is then untenable within social praxis, and representation is itself falsifying and prone to abuse of power, as we have seen illustrated in both Kundera and Spiegelman, these texts suggest the need for a new way to configure the real as an accessible way to found identity and fight power without proffering it as an inviolable idyll that excludes and abuses. Notes I would like to express my thanks to Susan Leonardi and Kandice Chuh for their invaluable help in the preparation of this manuscript. 1. Lyotard takes the idiosyncratic position that the postmodern actually precedes the modern. He observes that the (post)modern takes place in the realization that neither narrative nor scientific discourse can present an objective truth. The modern displays a nostalgia, or a longing, for the previous era's belief in a totalizing system by which to understand the world. The postmodern accepts (embraces?) the relativist new era. Although Lyotard's definition is far from the only assessment of the postmodern, the characteristic of a retreat from an "essential" and coherent belief system is standardly associated with</page><page sequence="42">142 1 ERIC BERLATSKY postmodernism with either positive or negative connotations (or both), depend- ing on the critic. 2. It is in this sense that I see poststructuralist deconstruction as a practice related to postmodernism as a site of theoretical exchange. Both emphasize the impossibility of accessing a foundational or essential truth. Deconstruction does so by revealing the contradictions and "supplementary" logic of the central texts of Western metaphysics (and literature), while postmodern theory in the mode of Lyotard, Baudrillard, and Jameson posit the current age as that of lost metanarra- tives (Lyotard) and the dissolution of the difference between the simulation (the textual representation) and the real (Baudrillard). Of course, these (largely Marx- ist and post-Marxist) theorists take different positions on the desirability of this historical development, with Jiirgen Habermas (fairly consistently) advocating a return to the values and philosophical approach of the Enlightenment, and Jameson (at times) displaying a nostalgia for a less fragmented and historically amnesiac time. Lyotard, of course, sees the dissolution of master narratives as a positive and necessary development, while Baudrillard (in his later work) seems to apocalyptically accept and embrace the development of signification without referent. Common to all of them, however, is the sense that, as Linda Hutcheon points out, "the master narratives of bourgeois liberalism are under attack" (1988, 6). 3. I use this term ("postmodernist fiction," borrowed from Brian McHale) as a way of suggesting some shared preoccupations with postmodern theorists, like Lyotard and Baudrillard, but not necessarily a shared discursive field. The writers I discuss are not explicitly theorizing the postmodern world, although they do share an interest in the difficulty of accessing truth, reality, and the past as a site of investigation. In their attempts to move outside the theorization of lost signification and into the realm of representing history, they call attention to the sociopolitical repercussions of the theories I have discussed (as the theorists themselves also do in different ways). 4. Defined here loosely as the preoccupation with the destabilization of the confidence in referentiality and a historical referent. 5. Although it is unfashionable to name the narrator as the author, it is also difficult in the case of The Book and Maus not to do so. Their autobiographical components make it difficult, as we shall see, to confirm these books as novels with purely fictional narrators. The distinction between fiction and reality is instead consistently challenged. If, as this article and much postmodern theory argue, reality as we perceive it is a narrative construction of sorts, the distinction becomes even less tenable. 6. The genocide also included the killing of millions of gypsies and gays. Despite this fact, however, the Holocaust has become intensely identified with the Jewish experience. 7. See the next section of this essay for a more thorough discussion of the differences between history, memory, and collective memory. 8. In this context, Gilman takes Lopate's comments to be an example of</page><page sequence="43">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 143 Jewish "self-hatred." Where Lopate critiques an overemphasis on the Shoah, Gilman insists on its centrality. Both, however, acknowledge the centrality the memory of the Shoah has had in practice in contemporary Jewish religious and communal identification. 9. This phrase is borrowed from Paul John Eakin's investigation of the art of self-representation, Touching the World (1992). 10. See Richard Terdiman's fascinating Modernity and Memory Crisis for an account of how the lost faith in the representational capacity of memory is a dis- tinguishing feature of the twentieth century. Terdiman also provides a useful analysis of the parallels between the slippage of linguistic signification (in semi- otic discourse) and the slippage of mnemonic signification. Memory, in the past century, is always seen to be inextricable from forgetting as direct access to past experience is consistently denied. 11. In other words, while Kundera exposes and discusses the obvious ways in which the obliteration of Clementis is a distortion of the historical record, Fou- cault and de Certeau assert that the erasure and silencing of facts, events, and occurrences is an unavoidable and constitutive part of unifying traditional or "classical" history. The Clementis example is merely a more obvious representa- tive of the consistent narrative violence of which all history partakes. It is in this way that the two fundamental requirements for classical history contradict one another. It is impossible for a unifying narrative to exist and also be completely referential. Rather the real and its unifying narration are incompatible, according to Foucault and de Certeau. 12. This rather extreme assertion has been contested, of course, but it does provide a useful touchstone to the concept of collective memory that is largely Halbwachs's. 13. This, likewise, ties to Baudrillard's sense of the postmodern world in which signifier and signified, simulation and the real, are indistinguishable from one another. Here the representation (history) seems identical or at least indistin- guishable from what was once considered the historical real (history). 14. We might call this narrativization inevitable in the sense that, as Derrida offers, there is nothing "outside the text." Again, the difficulty of separating the real from the representation is the key problem here, as any telling or representa- tion of his memories turns reality into discourse. 15. Here it might be helpful to advert to Hegel's distinctions between mem- ory and recollection. If memory (or the intuition) is the images and feelings that exist in our past and in "the dark depths of our inner being," recollection is that process by which these memories become "our actual possession" (1971, ?454), become integrated into the ego, and become part of the self. Here Mirek attempts to incorporate Zdena into his ego by erasing those parts of her that do not corre- spond to his image of himself. In this Hegelian conception, we might see Zdena as part of his memories, but not of his recollection. However, it seems that Kun- dera tries to break down the difference between these two Hegelian concepts as the self becomes more of a performative construction than a synthetic creation,</page><page sequence="44">144 | ERIC BERLATSKY and recollection becomes less a means of identity formation and more of a narra- tive performance that excludes and erases, eliminating memories and truth in its quest for synthetic wholeness. 16. It may be useful to understand the psychoanalytic "return of the repressed" as itself a cultural narrative that makes sense of trauma. The portrayal of ethnic and cultural haunting is already, in one sense, an emplotment (a nar- rativizing or textualizing) even before the exorcism that Sethe achieves with Beloved. Beloved, in Henderson's terms, is already part of the narrative of the Uncanny (unheimlich) and the return of the repressed. All of this, of course, refers principally to Freud's psychoanalytic theory and practice of which memory is possibly the key and vital element. Freud founds neurotic subjectivity in particu- lar and subjectivity in general substantially on traumatic (sexual) memories that have hitherto been "repressed." "We give the name of traumas to those impres- sions, experienced early and later forgotten, to which we attach such great im- portance in the aetiology of neuroses" (Freud, Moses and Monotheism, 72). The psychoanalytic process, then, is meant to move the subject from repeating (reen- acting the trauma in a different form) to remembering (recalling the trauma rather than repressing it), to working through the trauma. Although the exact way to work through the trauma is at times unclear, at least part of the process is the narration of and reintegration of the repressed event into the ego, or the subject's narrative of their own life (the talking cure). The therapeutic narration of the repressed event seems to me to be reflected by the working through that Sethe does in Beloved, reviving the repressed event of the murder of Beloved and reinte- grating it into a new story to conquer her neuroses. In The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, however, it seems the urge to renarrate and unify the ego (or the self) is an oppressive force of erasure and suppression rather than a productive work- ing through. While this (unavoidably reductive) account of Freudian psycho- analysis seems to suggest that the recovery of the truth and its narration are essential to a healthy subjectivity, the Kunderan model suggests (along with post- structural historical accounts of history and memory) that the recovery of the truth and its narration are irreconcilable and that the attempt to unify the ego, particularly through narration (as seen here with Mirek) is an oppressive and exclusionary procedure. Of course, the status of truth is already radically brought into question in Freud, particularly through the concept of screen memories, foundational (and at times traumatic) memories that may in fact be false memo- ries substituted for the true repressed memories in the unconscious. How to dif- ferentiate screen memories from true memories is never completely clear and lends itself to a (post)modern "withdrawal of the real." This Freudian relativism has additionally become a central site of contestation because of Freud's willing- ness to deny the essential truth of his patients' memories of sexual molestation. Freud's initial adherence to the facticity of the unconscious and his later increas- ing inability to separate truth and "phantasy" in it is chronicled by Terdiman (1993, 240-343). 17. "The only amusing thing about it all was my existence, the existence of</page><page sequence="45">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 145 a man erased from history, from literary histories, and from the telephone book, of a dead man now returned to life in an amazing reincarnation to preach the great truth of astrology to hundreds of thousands of young people in a socialist country" (The Book, 84). 18. In an interview reprinted in Kundera's theoretical Art of the Novel, Kundera suggests that his characters are constructed from an "existential code" made of a conglomeration of words: "For Tereza [in The Unbearable Lightness of Being]: body, soul, vertigo, weakness, idyll, Paradise. For Tomas: lightness, weight" (1986, 29). 19. Increasingly, postmodern theory has attempted to deconstruct divisions between fiction and history, nonreferential and referential narrative, as the quo- tation from de Man (1979, 920; quoted earlier) indicates. De Man, in the passage quoted, takes the most extreme postmodern position that in fact the real does not exist until it is represented in writing. Partially through de Man's influence, how- ever, it has become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to claim the transpar- ent referentiality of autobiographical narrative. In a recent effort to arrest the slippage between history and fiction, Dorrit Cohn has pointed out the generic and narratological conventions that separate the fictional from the historical, but she acknowledges that the conventions of autobiography and autobiographical novels are often indistinguishable, as in the paradigmatic case of Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu. Likewise, she is reluctant to consider closely the genre of what Linda Hutcheon calls historiographic metafiction: self-reflexive, postmod- ern, but simultaneously historical narrative like that of Kundera and Spiegelman. 20. This is particularly the case in early twentieth-century discourse about involuntary, spontaneous, or unconscious memories (as opposed to those inten- tionally brought to consciousness by the subject). The idea that spontaneous memories may be more reliable (more connected to the real) than voluntary or conscious memories is, of course, a commonplace in Proust but makes surprising reappearances in other contexts as well. "The valorization of powerful, uncon- scious, involuntary, or spontaneous memories over conscious or voluntary mem- ory by both Bergson and Proust may well constitute a strong current in the cultural unconscious of Joyce's Ulysses" (Rickard 1999, 61). Likewise, the Freud- ian return of the repressed is a corresponding type of unconscious memory. Freud is not confident in the referentiality of such returning repressed memories (see his "Screen Memories"), and the radically postmodern view would discour- age the distinction between the textual representation of conscious memory and the (supposed) reality of spontaneous memory. The first (at least in its reiteration) may be as discursive as the latter, although the distinction between them high- lights how difficult and complicated a problem memory is. Some events may, of course, be merely forgotten (perhaps because they are unimportant), others are repressed (because they are so important). The result to the conscious mind seems remarkably similar. 21. "Symbolic" is, of course, Lacan's term, and is useful here in distinguish- ing between the "Real" (that which is beyond explanation or signification) and</page><page sequence="46">146 | ERIC BERLATSKY that which is "inside the text" (to adopt Derrida's formulation). For Lacan, the "Real" is that which defies explanation, causality, and signification and corre- sponds to Freud's unconscious while adapting it to the linguistic realm (for Lacan, the unconscious is, of course, structured like a language). The "Symbolic" realm, then, is discursive, subject to emplotment, and invested with meaning. The "Real" is the sublime, beyond explanation but (as its name suggests) perhaps the most completely referential despite its elusiveness. 22. This is once again within a Freudian framework, where personal trauma leads to the repression of memories of that event. Here, I apply the idea loosely to a community that has a traumatic event that occurs to all in the community (at least metaphorically speaking) and is, therefore, prone to collective repression. 23. Again, the Hegelian definition of "recollection" is useful. See note 15. 24. Derrida's famous deconstruction (in Dissemination) of writing as "phar- makon," both poison and cure, is applicable here. Although it is often writing that is trusted and valorized in much contemporary discourse, the spoken seems to hold a reservoir of immanence for many in terms of remembering the Holocaust. 25. Here I am employing Neil Gotanda's terms, originally adopted in a legal context, but useful in separating racial identifications inscribed from without and those constructed from within a racialized group. "Formal-race" refers to the external, supposedly neutral, formal characteristics ascribed to certain racial groups by societal discourse, while "historical race" refers to the combination of societal inscription and communal identification that has "created" the race as currently constituted (1995, 257). Gotanda's use of several different terms to replace the singular term "race" helps problematize the essentialist and mono- lithic understanding of race still prevalent in contemporary society. 26. Actually, in a more radically postmodern view of identity, they were never born "Black," except in the sense that identity can only be formulated in discourse, and a discourse that denied the positivist "one drop of blood" rule common to the United States did not popularly exist. 27. This idea of historical events fitting into a previously established dra- matic plot, here one of innocence and redemption, is akin to the poststructural historiography of Hayden White who notes how historical discourse partakes of emplotment, which mediates, obscures, or obliterates historical access to the real (or to meaning) through discursive mediation. 28. Joshua Brown argues that "the Jews are not mice, the Poles are not pigs, the Germans are not cats. The anthropomorphic presentation of the characters should make that eminently clear" (1988, 105; emphasis in original). Brown may overstate the case somewhat, but it is clear that Spiegelman's appropriation of Nazi iconography is meant ironically, not literally. We must also note that Spiegel- man partakes of stereotypical depictions of the gentile characters as well, with French frogs and Gypsy moths. While this appears to be an effort to expose and concretize discursive constructions of racial identity, it only makes this an obvi- ous and political issue in the case of the Jews.</page><page sequence="47">MEMORY AS FORGETTING | 147 29. Dominick LaCapra's study of Maus in History and Memory after Auschwitz (1998) analyzes its hybridity in depth (see especially 143-55). 30. "But Anja-her appearance-you could see more easy she was Jewish. I was afraid for her" (Maus, 136). 31. Again, White's suggestion that there are only so many stories that events can be plotted into seems relevant here. In denying Vladek the narrative of messianic redemption, Artie finds himself faced with the narrative of Jewish miserliness, which is of course intimately connected with the narrative of anti- Semitism that contributed to the Holocaust in the first place. The desire to avoid emplotment does not seem like an easily attainable goal here. 32. For an account of this discourse, see Gilman's The Jew's Body (1991), 99-101,234-43. For example, "For Jews bear the salient stigma of the black skin of the syphilitic"; and "The Jews are black, according to nineteenth-century racial science, because they are not a pure race, because they are a race which has come from Africa" (99). 33. If, for de Certeau, classical history is characterized by its tendency to construct "others" of the past, we can see how collective memory is equally prone to constructing "others," only here in the politically dangerous present. 34. This is the side of the border we might associate with Baudrillard, who writes, "All Western faith and good faith became engaged in [a] wager on repre- sentation: that a sign could refer to the depth of meaning, that a sign could be exchanged for meaning and that something could guarantee this exchange-God of course. But what if God himself can be simulated, that is to say can be reduced to the signs that constitute faith? Then the whole system becomes weightless, it is no longer itself anything but a gigantic simulacrum-not unreal, but a simu- lacrum, that is to say never exchanged for the real, but exchanged for itself, in an uninterrupted circuit without reference or circumference" (1994, 5-6).
