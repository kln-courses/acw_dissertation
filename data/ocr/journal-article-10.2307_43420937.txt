<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 1 By S. ZUCKERMAN The University of Oxford Roughly speaking, there are two schools of thought in animal psychology. Those who adhere to the first, the mechanistic school, are satisfied with the statement of animal behaviour provided by proper scientific study. According to this school, it is the task of the subject to collect accurate data about the ways of animals, to classify them according to scientific methods, and to proceed to the formulation of general concepts - or what are usually styled " mechanisms " - of behaviour. This school is essentially an experimental school, for scientific hypotheses in biology, whether they be merely an economical way of stating a series of facts in the form usually regarded as " explanation," or whether they attain to the value of " predictive hypotheses," cannot, with rare exceptions, be constructed except by the use of carefully controlled experiment. Predictive hypotheses necessarily have to assume a novel quality in relation to the content of the original premises from which they are derived, for scientific analysis involves the statement of one thing in terms of other things. It is the good fortune of mechanistic students of animal behaviour, if they wish, both to be unlimited in the number of problems they investigate, and to be unhampered in their scientific progress by philosophical misgivings. In this way they have an advantage over the second, or vitalistic, school, whose adherents, being dissatisfied with " ordinary " scientific method, repeatedly raise doubts as to the philosophical validity of scientific investiga- tions. This being so, the main question under discussion - viz. the methods of animal psychology - can best be considered by examin- ing the opinion that the mechanistic point of view provides an unsatisfactory science of behaviour. 1 From a paper contributed to the discussion on " the Interpretation of Animal Behaviour," Sections D and H, British Association for the Advance- ment of Science, Aberdeen Meeting, September 1934. 639</page><page sequence="2">640 SCIENCE PROGRESS As a rule, the primary objection raised against the mechanistic approach is that it fails to take heed of the distinction between living and non-living, and that consequently the method of biology misguidedly becomes that of the physical sciences. Our president, Dr. E. S. Russell, attributes this supposed error to the influence of Cartesian philosophy.1 In considering this question, it is essential to distinguish between two issues : the first that Cartesian philosophy implies that animals are simply mechanical contrivances : the second that the method of science used in investigating living things follows the same logic as the method used in the physical sciences. So far as I can see, there is no reason for regarding these two issues as necessarily interdependent. In view of what has been said to the contrary, it is necessary to stress the point that the observational and experi- mental methods of biological science would have been the same whether or not the Cartesian doctrine of mind and matter had ever been stated. Before this matter is considered further, it is of interest to examine the view that a definable qualitative differ- ence between animals and inanimate matter is sufficiently marked to necessitate a different scientific method of investigation for each. We are told that the distinctive characteristic of the behaviour of living, as opposed to non-living things, is that it exhibits pur- pose or directive activity ; that there is always an end (in the teleological sense) to the individualised activity of an organism, and that because of this inherent purpose by which it is charac- terised, the behaviour of living things requires a type of investigation different from that employed in the investigation of the activity of a non-living system. If, however, we consider it closely, this appeal to teleology appears to argue much less against than for the investigation of the behaviour of living organisms by the methods of physical science. An immediate objection to emphasising the teleological character of the overt behaviour of living systems is the fact that the most obviously purposive systems which we know are man-made machines. It is possible to visualise a mechanical system - for a crude example, a radio-directed model of a ship - whose overt behaviour would provide analogies for almost all the usually defined peculiar char- acters of the behaviour of living bodies - a system with individualised activity, with a purpose, with one " life-cycle " if the term may be allowed - with " needs," responsive to its environment, and with protective devices. Bertrand Russell,2 in considering where the 1 The Advancement of Science , 1934, Brit. Assoc., London. 2 An Outline of Philosophy , 1927, Allen &amp; Unwin, London.</page><page sequence="3">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 641 difference lies between the perception of a living system and the sensitivity which characterises many non-living systems (e.g. photo- graphic plates), has suggested that it is in the fact that " living bodies are subject to the law of association or of the ' conditioned reflex.' " Even this, however, is no longer true. Electrical appar- atus has been constructed,1 whose behaviour provides an amazing parallel to the various phenomena of the conditioned reflex. On the whole, therefore, the appeal for a new methodology in the study of the behaviour of living organisms on the score of the teleological nature of this behaviour seems rather out of place. As Henderson has wisely written,2 " though we can readily separate the mechanical from the teleological in nature, we can on no account separate the teleological from the mechanical, if we are to think about it scientifically." It is significant that students who can face their prejudices towards teleological explanation in a relatively detached manner hold the view that scientific method and science itself have no connection with teleology. There could be no better exposition than that of Henderson 3 of the part teleology can play in a descrip- tion of the non-living world of physics and chemistry. Wherever we seek, there is purpose, wherever we look, there is adaptation. Yet Henderson gives as his opinion that " scientific conclusions are independent of the philosophical problem of teleology." And, as we all know, teleology is never resorted to in the scientific study of the physical world. " Science knows nothing of first causes," 4 and science has little, if any, business with such teleological con- cepts as purpose. Such being the case, it may be asked how the scientific investiga- tion of animal behaviour is to proceed. This brings me back to my point that the deterministic method, which is the true scientific method, bears no necessary relation to Cartesian materialism. So far as the mechanistic investigator of behaviour is concerned, the organism is a going concern. Its phenomena are investigated and classified, and laws are then devised to describe, as simply as possible, their arrangements and relationships. These laws do not rule the animal's activities ; the animal still goes on, as it would have done had no laws been made, pursuing the various pastimes that make up its life -cycle. 1 Hull, C.

TT</page><page sequence="4">642 SCIENCE PROGRESS The mechanistic method proceeds by the creation of scientific laws, and mechanism need not be taken to consist in more than these laws. In saying this, I feel no guilt in the fact that by com- pletely identifying it with determinism I am perhaps limiting the meaning which can be read into mechanism. The old notion of cause, in the sense of anthropomorphic pushes and pulls, as has been argued by Bertrand Russell,1 has no real place in science. It may still aid in the formulation of preliminary scientific laws, but philosophical validity belongs only to the view that causality subsists in " the fact that events at different times are connected by laws." Pearson has defined cause in science as " a stage in a routine of experience," and in exemplification of this view his reference to Kirchoff 's definition of mechanics may well be recalled : " Mechanics is the science of motion ; we define as its object the complete description in the simplest possible manner of such motions as occur in nature." In this definition, so Pearson holds, lies " the only consistent view of mechanism and the true conception of scientific law." 2 His opinion seems manifestly sound. Only in the sense of cause just defined need we believe that every phenomenon is the result of mechanical causation. It is difficult to escape the conviction that those who assail mechanism to-day do so in misconception of its true scientific significance. There need be nothing in mechanism which is fatal to the study of living things. And before this point is dismissed, it must be remembered that mechanism is not synonymous with materialism. Provided he does not tangle his science with his philosophy, the scientist, if he wants, can be a gross materialist, or alternatively believe that all phenomena are products of his own mind. Consequently, we may be permitted to wonder if the question asked by Dr. E. S. Russell in his presidential address - namely, what chance there is for a " real science " of animal behaviour to develop if Cartesian dualism is accepted - is relevant. The Cartesian dualism of mind and matter may be an entirely fallacious philosophy, mechanism nevertheless remains the method of scien- tific thought - because it is the method that works. In his address, Dr. Russell put the view that " modern physics has completely transformed the old conception of matter, and has little use for the notion of material determinism." This, if true, strikes of course at the heart of what I have just called " the method of scientific thought." I doubt, however, whether Dr. Russell meant his words to be taken literally. It is far from certain that 1 Bertrand Russell, op. cit . 2 Pearson, op. cit .</page><page sequence="5">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 643 modern physics has abandoned determinism. An appeal to authority is always useful in debate, and I may therefore point out that Einstein, Planck, and Rutherford, to mention a few theoretical and experimental physicists, have certainly not denied the philo- sophical implications of determinism, any more than they have turned their backs on it in the laboratory.1 It is also relevant to quote Nature on this question. In a recent editorial appears the statement : " Newtonian mechanics, so far from being in ruins, is more firmly established than ever as the form taken in ordinary circumstances by the mechanics of relativity." 2 I have indicated, I hope successfully, the reasons for my belief that there is no definable basis for the view that the peculiarities of living systems require a type of scientific investigation different from that demanded by non-living matter, and I have also tried to show that the mechanistic method of investigation may be regarded as something valid per se. This brings me to another matter, namely the question of the method's reputed shortcomings. Dr. Bierens de Haan has just affirmed that the results obtained by strictly objective analysis of behaviour are inadequate because, to quote his own words, such analysis " gives us only a number of parts, while the bond that links them is lacking." This criticism is made, not only of the analysis of living behaviour, but also of the analysis of non-living systems, and it is closely related to the basic idea of the philosophies of holism and emergent evolution, the essential thesis of which, as I understand them, is the emergence of novel and unpredictable properties at each new and higher level of the organisation of the constituent parts of things. It seems to me, as it has seemed to others before, that the objection suffers from two striking weaknesses. In the first place, the criticism presupposes that experimental science has already uncovered all the reflexes, tropisms, and other basic mechanisms of behaviour that it can ever possibly unfold, and that the books when balanced show a sad discrepancy between the sum total of the separate items, such as reflexes, that have come out of the investigation, and the primary behaviour material that was put into the investigation. This is a sad slight on an experimental science that has hardly scratched the surface in its task of exposing mechanisms of behaviour, and the fruits of whose investigations become richer and more numerous every day. If present advances are any indication of what is to be, what we now know in the 1 See Sir Herbert Samuel, " Cause, Effect and Professor Eddington," Nineteenth Century , 1933, CXIII, 469. 2 Nature , 134, 340, Sept. 8, 1934.</page><page sequence="6">644 SCIENCE PROGRESS field of the conditioned reflex, or in that of perception, or in that of cortical mechanisms of behaviour, is but a very small part of the knowledge that we shall presently have. We may well doubt whether those who make this criticism would regard explanations in terms of reflex theory or in terms of any other mechanistic concept as really inadequate to interpret the actual situations to which the concepts primarily relate. The mechanist never claims more for his views, as Hogben 1 has written, than " that as far as we can see at present his way of dealing with things leads to the most complete unanimity which it is possible to attain." This is but one weakness of the attack which uses as its weapon the argument that parts of behaviour do not make up the whole of behaviour. There is another and perhaps more significant one ; the argument is based upon a misconception of the usual direction and intention of scientific investigation. The nature of this mis- conception has been eloquently expounded by Professor Levy,2 but the argument cannot be harmed by repetition, especially in view of what has been said both by Dr. Russell and by Dr. Bierens de Haan. In our investigations of behaviour we have to begin with the whole animal as it is given to us by common sense, and from its many activities we isolate, mentally, if you like, at first, parts which we wish to examine more closely. We are careful, of course, that the isolated parts, from the point of view of the investigation of their nature, are neutral to the wider environment to which they belong. If they were not neutral they could not be investigated as unique and separable systems. So far as the original, unique, whole behaviour is concerned, this method, in Professor Levy's words, simply discloses the unique combination of isolated systems that it possesses. Every isolated system, every isolate we define, is " unique in its mode of functioning, otherwise it would not be isolated " ; every isolate is also a " unique combination of its sub- isolates " - of which one, in the field of behaviour and as the analysis proceeds, may turn out to be - let us say - a reflex. As we become concerned with the wider or narrower issues in behaviour, we widen or restrict the sphere of isolation so as to include just enough of the environment to make our system neutral for the purpose of our particular observations. The process of isolation may be continued until the limits of scientific measurement are reached. Reflexes and tropisms are some of the theoretical isolates defined in the study of animal behaviour. They are not, however, 1 The Nature of Living Matter, 1930, Kegan Paul, London. 2 The Universe of Science , 1932, Watts, London.</page><page sequence="7">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 645 isolated entities. There are no disembodied reflexes, any more than there are atoms and molecules other than those which are " the intellectual conceptions by aid of which physicists classify phenomena." 1 The larger isolate, the animal's total behaviour, is primary to the smaller isolate, the reflex, and the smaller isolate has meaning only in its unique relation to its parent isolate. It is the latter which is the prime reality, and thus from the scientific point of view it is by the whole that the parts are primarily described - not the parts which have to describe the whole. It is therefore small wonder that the gross phenomena of experience cannot be reconstructed by the recombination of hypostasised scientific isolates. A satisfactory " explanation " of a form of behaviour would be a full statement of the pattern of its usefully definable sub-isolates in their combination of interactions within it. If a statement in terms of reflexes were to prove an unsatisfactory description for any particular behaviour pattern, it would not mean that descrip- tion in terms of other behavioural isolates would also necessarily provide an unsatisfactory explanation. It would not spell the doom of the analytical method in the interpretation of behaviour. It would only mean that reflexes happened to be inadequate isolates of the particular larger system concerned. Having said this it is necessary for me to add, lest I have conveyed a false impression, that no one can doubt that the reflex is an adequate concept for the description of some types of behaviour. To say that a descrip- tion of behaviour in terms of such a concept leaves out of account the bond which makes reflexes part of the totality of behaviour is to leave unconsidered the fact that the concept received definition by the investigation of a part of behaviour which was capable of isolation, and had meaning, only because it was part of the organised whole of behaviour. So far my argument has been chiefly aimed at defending the deterministic method of science against the attacks that have been directed upon it at this meeting. It is now time to examine the measures that have been suggested to replace this method. Essentially they fall into two groups : the first relating to the proposal to use the concept of organisation ; the second to amplify objective description with terms borrowed from introspective psychology. We have been advised to follow the " organismal " approach. We have been told that the wholeness of the animal is primary and fundamental to the differentiation of its behaviour mechanisms. It has been pointed out " that early behaviour does not arise through 1 Pearson, op. cit .</page><page sequence="8">646 SCIENCE PROGRESS the addition and combination of originally separate reflexes," 1 and we have heard that wholeness runs not only through the animal's developmental life, but also through its perceptual life and through its processes of learning. No one could possibly take exception to these statements. At the same time, we may be permitted to wonder whether the doctrine of " wholeness " matters much from the scientific point of view, at any rate in so far as a change of method is concerned. The co-ordination of the activities of animals is fundamentally given in the fact of their very existence. If animals were not co-ordinated wholes they could not be studied for what they are. If their parts and activities were differently co-ordinated, they would be different animals. In short, the wholeness of animals is the point at which we begin their scientific investigation. If I correctly understand the terms as they have been used here, organisation is closely linked with adaptation, and purpose emerges as a characteristic of an animal's adapted activities within its field of experience. On their face value, I cannot see how such trite ideas add an iota to the technique of scientific enquiry, nor can I see how they could possibly change it. Indeed that is the one thing that has not been told us. We have been advised to abandon our analytical methods, and to begin as organismic students of behaviour - but, strange though it be, from the few indications we have been given on how to proceed, it would seem that having publicly declared ourselves to be organismic students we must once again start analysing. It is difficult to believe that the invo- cation of teleological ideas brings us a single step nearer to our specific scientific problem of the interpretation of organised patterns of behaviour. Assuming of course that they do not propose to content themselves with stating general teleological principles and leaving it at that, those who, in supposed opposition to the mechan- istic school, declare themselves to be organismic students are hiding from themselves the fact that any moves they might make to investigate animal behaviour will have to be along paths beaten by the mechanists. I think I am right in believing that the opponents of mechan- istic analysis have not used the concept of organisation at this meeting to mean more than a mystical something given in the initial premise of organised behaviour. I can find no indication of any other meaning in what I have heard. At the same time, it would be unfair to leave the matter at this point, for a scientific problem definitely lies in the question of the organising factors 1 E. S. Russell, The Behaviour of Animals, 1934, Arnold, London.</page><page sequence="9">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 647 themselves. Like other scientific questions, it cannot, however, be profitably examined except by the deterministic method of science. The search for " organising principles " by means of this method has yielded such fruits as the theory of the integrative action of the nervous system and the theory of endocrine regulation. If organising factors exist in overt behaviour, they will be uncovered in the same way - and so far as we now know, in no other way. It is by no means uncommon for those opposed to mechanistic abstractions such as the conditioned reflex, to regard the concept of organisation within the perceptual field - one of the central issues of " Gestalt psychology " - as something which undermines a deterministic science of behaviour. This, for example, is the opinion of our President, who has summarised his view of the matter by telling us that " the principle of the whole is as valid for the perceptual field as it is for executive behaviour." The same debating use has been made of Lashley's experiments on the relation of the cortex to learning.1 The argument is one which I fail to understand. It is a fact, amply established by experiment, that the responses of animals in some situations are responses to complexes or patterns in the perceptual field, and not to unrelated single specific things within the field. It is also established that animals sometimes react to the relations between things and not to the things them- selves. These findings, like those of Lashley, seem to me to fit perfectly well into a mechanistic view of behaviour, even though they may argue against the possibility of an exhaustive explanation in terms of point-to-point relations between single stimuli and single receptors. Some " Gestalt " and organismic psychologists attempt to persuade us, however, that the facts mean something more than appears at first sight. They see in them, as it were, a wider pattern formed by an intimate linkage of the perceiving object and the pattern it perceives and to which it reacts, and they are startled by the vision as if by a new discovery. But is it not in fact the very situation which they originally set out to inter- pret ? Is it not the problem as it occurs in nature ? Köhler 2 would have us believe that physical science takes a disorderly nature, " a world of confused experience," and out of it fashions " a world of clear and hard reality." I find it difficult to imagine this disorderly naïve universe of perception. Moreover, as a mechanist, I find it equally difficult to be impressed with the obvious fact that order and pattern do exist in the world we perceive. If 1 Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence , 1929, University of Chicago Press. 2 Gestalt Psychology, 1930, Bell, London.</page><page sequence="10">648 SCIENCE PROGRESS they did not so exist, there could be no repetition in thought, and we should be unable to construct any organised system of scientific data. In our work we do not synthesise by chance , out of a com- pletely heterogeneous perceptual world, particular patterns for examination. If in any conceivable way we did so, it is remarkable that so many of us synthesise the same elements into the same patterns in such a way that we can get together and discuss them as we are doing this morning. Because we are all fundamentally made in the same way, there is nothing more inevitable than the fact that a common type of organisation characterises the per- ceptual world each of us as it were creates. Every living organism presumably forms a whole with those parts of the external world which are significant to it. In so far as the small worlds of different organisms do not overlap, they are all presumably smaller parts of a wider and more embracing world. Each organism exists only within its own organised perceptual world, and all its reactions in it are obviously organised reactions to organised parts of it. To emphasise this fact as though it were revolutionary seems to me absurd. To do so merely points to the sad fact that once again we have been blinded by general principles, and that once again we have come back to the starting point in our interpretation of behaviour, to the point where deterministic analysis begins. Of the suggestions that have been made for the modification of the present mechanistic methods in animal psychology, only one is of any concrete significance. Both Dr. Bierens de Haan and Dr. Russell wish us, if necessary, to explain an animal's behaviour in terms of its presumed subjective experiences. I suppose no one could seriously object to the thesis that animals have subjective lives, for the question is one that is impervious to scientific statement and scientific proof. If there are students of animal behaviour who feel that a science relating to subjective experience can be established in non-ambiguous terms, it is up to them to prove their point. Introspective human psychology has had considerable difficulty from this point of view, and animal psychology can scarcely hope to have less. It cannot even have the direct aid of the animals of whose subjective experiences it wishes to learn, for unlike human beings, animals cannot tell us what they feel, and why they think they do the things they do. I should think that the best we could expect from describing animal behaviour in the terminology of introspective psychology is the enhancement of our sympathetic attitude toward animals, with a consequent increase in our intuitive understanding of their ways.</page><page sequence="11">THE INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR 649 But these things do not necessarily have anything to do with science, even though they might help to discover the kind of question regarding animal behaviour which can profitably be asked from the scientific point of view. In spite of this possible advantage, my opinion is that the re-introduction of the terminology of intro- spective psychology would be a disastrous step, calculated only to return the subject to its discredited anthropomorphic and anecdotal phase. The study of animal behaviour should be allowed to proceed, and animal behaviour should continue to be interpreted, by the one method that gives certain knowledge - namely, by the applica- tion of well-established scientific method to objectively definable data, data which can be stated without the fear of ambiguity. What real advances animal psychology has made in the past have only been made by this method, which is in no way restricted in its mode of operation. The method can operate in the usual inductive way to elucidate a limitless field of phenomena of animal behaviour. And it can also be used deductively to great effect - as it has been, for example, by Professor C. L. Hull 1 - not in mystical fashion, but by employing the general findings of experi- mental psychology as a basis for postulates which may serve for the purpose of further investigation. 1 For example, " The Goal Gradient Hypothesis and Maze Learning/' Psychol, rev., 1932, 39, p. 25.</page></plain_text>
