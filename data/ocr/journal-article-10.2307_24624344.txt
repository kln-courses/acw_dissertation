<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alison Fanous Cotti-Lowell Narrating through Comics in Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy Patrick McCabe's 1992 novel The Butcher Boy—narrated in the arresting first person voice of Francie Brady—has attained near-canonical status among con temporary Irish novels. Francie, in his early teens in small-town Ireland in the 1960s, loses his mother to suicide and his father to alcoholism, and subsequently murders the mother of his childhood enemy. In the first sentence of his retro spective account of these events, Francie divulges that "When I was a young lad twenty or thirty or forty years ago I lived in a small town where they were all after me on account of what I done on Mrs. Nugent."1 In the course of the story, we watch as he kills her with the gun that he uses to kill pigs at the local abattoir, cuts her up, and then pushes her remains around for an entire day in his meat cart. Mrs. Nugent's crimes against Francie include her smug Englishness (the Nugents have just returned from living in England) and her air of superiority to ward Francie's broken family. Moreover, Francie believes that she causes his only friend, Joe, to turn against him. The drama of social ills and violence unfolds exclusively through Francie's voice; thus, we find in The Butcher Boy the personal narrative of a murderer. The relentless narration of McCabe's novel creates an opening into the mind of a young killer that is both compelling and shocking. The first-person narrative, according to one recent persuasive reading, func tions as a commentary on twentieth-century Irish society; Francie may be best understood as a survivor of the flawed institutional system for dealing with those who do not fit the national mold of de Valéra's Ireland. He is a victim of an "ar ray of interdependent institutions... that obscured the less desirable elements attached to a number of interrelated social phenomena, including poverty, il legitimacy" and more.2 Francie is indeed admitted, or committed, three times to institutions: first to an industrial school where he is abused and molested; second to a mental hospital; and finally, he is locked away in a prison for the î.

Reading The Butcher Boy as survivor testimony thus "exposes Irish society's deployment of an architecture of containment to police and main tain the nation's nativist imaginary."3 In this context, Francie Brady emerges as a monster created by society—a product of isolation, misunderstanding, and psy chopathologies engendered by the abuses and failures of institutions in Ireland and the shortcomings of the community as a whole. Discussions of McCabe's novel within this general framework range in ap proach from cultural critique to psychoanalysis. Of the latter strain, John Scaggs argues that Francie, "like any language user," finds language "insufficient to deal with both the self and the world" beyond.4 Francie counters this linguistic in adequacy by refusing to enter Lacan's mirror stage, thus returning to a "pre linguistic space, to refuse the burden of subjectivity, and to remain in isolation from the world."5 Scaggs identifies the process of linguistic fracture as a direct result of Francie's lack of family coherence, and his recourse to repetitive role playing then occurs in lieu of performing his own "self." Scaggs's reading, there fore, still allows us to place at least some of the burden of blame upon Francie's non-nurturing familial environment and society's failure to provide successful mechanisms for support and intervention. In contrast, some remain skeptical of the idea that Francie Brady's narrative provides any coherent social commentary at all, preferring resolutely psychiatric diagnoses for Francie's problems.6 Francie Brady might be a paranoid schizophrenic or simply a misanthropic liar. Yet this unreliable narration—Francie's idiosyncratic voice—is not the simple symptom of his psychosis, but rather, the key to The Butcher Boy. His narrative is not the grid of containment to look beyond but the necessary object of analysis, for Francie's narration can be reconceived by revealing McCabe's debt to the representational strategies of the modern comic book. In turn, the language of Francie's testimony makes a cogent contribution to McCabe's com mentary on the cultural fabric of his world. He shows how the comic book, as a cultural form, can influence the construction of the human psyche and build the worldview of its readership. In short, the comic book is complicit in the creation of Francie Brady, the murderous juvenile delinquent also known as The Butcher Boy. 3. Smith, 123. 4. John Scaggs, "Who is Francie Pig?

Rüdiger Imhof, for example, writes that "Social issues are no doubt addressed in The Butcher Boy But the account is ill-equipped for diagnosing social wrongs in small-town Ireland during the 1960s or 1970s for the simple reason that all that is offered is filtered through the bewildered, sick mind of a fiendishly unreliable narrator."

In The Butcher Boy, comix exists at the level of grammar and prose style; comix influences the mode of character development; and comix helps us to understand McCabe's portrayal of the genesis of violence in the text. For example, Francie's account of the mur der of Mrs. Nugent at the climax of the narrative strongly echoes a scene from a comic book: "I lifted her off the floor with one hand and shot the bolt right into her head thlok was the sound it made, like a goldfish dropping into a bowl" (.BB 209). He lifts her single-handedly, a fantasy of strength for a boy in his very early teens, and the action is accompanied by a single-word sound effect, "thlok." Francie executes Mrs. Nugent for her imagined crimes against him, and the boy emerges from the page as a superhero eliminating a villain. The transference of the comic book into Francie's act of life-writing coexists with the develop ment of his criminality. Further, McCabe's deployment of both the comic book and comix in The Butcher Boy carefully carves out a critique of the cultural and political influence of America in twentieth-century Ireland, allowing the trans national significance of this disturbing national tale to surface. The infiltration of Francie's childhood by American cultural forms starts early in his recollection of events; he fosters his childhood friendship with Joe through games that engage with a panorama of popular entertainments including film, television, and comic books. For example, Francie remembers acting out a West ern fantasy when they "rode off out to the river" and fashioned themselves as Native American blood brothers with blackened faces and "injun" names (BB 53). Their bond also revolves around comic books. Together, they covet—and acquire—Philip Nugent's comic book collection. They "cleaned him out" al though it was apparently "only a laugh," and in so doing they cement cama raderie, exclude Philip from their private community, and assert their social dominance. The comic book even functions as a unit of capital in the social economy of childhood. Commodities aimed at children, including comics and other childhood luxuries such as the "Flash" bars that Francie craves, present a consumer-oriented allure that inducts children into the dominant social order y.

Reading comics has often been understood as a strategy of pure avoidance. Comics comprise just one segment of literature that may be termed "escapist," alongside "chick lit," horror, and other forms of entertainment "designed for mass appeal and minimal thinking."9 According to some critics of the comic book, this "escapist entertainment is all about 'hiding' from what really mat ters—namely, the real world, the people in it, and the important ideas that we should be grappling with there."10 Francie's real-world environment fails him, leaving the young boy floundering within an incoherent, inadequate family and social life in which he has no hope of thriving. In turn, he takes on alternative personas including "Mr. Algernon Carruthers Brady" and "Francie Brady—The Fugitive!" which distance him from his unpleasant reality (BB 133,41). Pictures of another life, another identity, and another reality offer Francie a venue for much-needed escapism. Play and entertainment culture are, thus, more than natural childhood di versions for Francie; they soon become a way for the troubled young boy to elude the desperation of his life—his mother's mental illness, his father's alco holism, and the systematic social exclusion of his family within the community. Algernon and The Fugitive are just two of Francie's comic book "selves," whose repeated presence indicates that Francie has begun to write himself into comic books, as well as read them. Perhaps most poignantly, he wants to become the ruddy-faced, dimple-cheeked boy on the back of one of his coloring books: "I had a name for him. I called him The Boy Who Could Walk For Ever and that was what I wanted to do now—become him once and for all" (BB 39). Francie attempts to realize this very dream when he runs away to Dublin. In this way, characters and illustrations presented by children's culture provide a means by which to enact not only a figurative but also a literal escape from his life. For Francie, the role of comics in child development extends beyond the rehearsal of consumer culture, reaching deep into psychological realms. The intermingling of fantasy with reality in The Butcher Boy brings with it a troubling underworld. Comic books contain more than cherub-faced boys; they may also contain stories of mild mischief, social transgression, and violence. The adventures and escapades of comic book characters may have pedagogical 8.

For instance, he performs ideas from these pictorial sources. He follows in the footsteps of The Boy Who Could Walk For Ever when he runs away from home. Eventually, he will commit murder in a manner that forcefully echoes a comic book superhero. The comic book's negative effects escalate, and Francie's engagement with childhood entertainments becomes increasingly inappropriate, as he grows older and as the recollected history progresses. McCabe acknowledges the passing of time when Francie returns from the industrial school and continues to play in the frozen puddle, only to find that a younger child has staked claim to it: "What are you doing here Mister he says, that's our puddle" (BB 106). Later, a boy re marks, "how can you play if you're big" (BB 212). Mister Francie is now a little older and the next cohort of young boys has quite naturally taken his place. Nev ertheless, Francie continues to re-envision his childhood days with Joe as a glit tering golden age and actively seeks to recreate those days in the present. Yearning for their lost childhood bond, Francie remembers, "I asked him to put on the cowboy voices like he used to. He said he couldn't do them any more. Go on, try Joe I said. I can't do them, he said, that's a long time ago... I couldn't stop asking him to say it again" (BB 116). McCabe exposes Francie's latent childlike outlook through his continuing desire for role-playing games. Memories of childhood exploits are a comforting vision of clarity for Francie: they "were the best days. You could see through them days, clear as polished glass" (BB 104). The allusion here to polished glass conjures not only a vision of transparency and lucidity, but also a picture of the idealized domesticity that eluded him in reality. For Francie, the comic books that originally served to create interpersonal ties eventually exclude him from his peer group; they mark him as Other when he fails to move forward into more advanced developmental stages and social relationships. Much to his frustration and dismay, Francie notes that Joe has moved on to cigarettes and sweets but "not comics he didn't read them much anymore" (BB 116). A mature reader selecting reading material supposedly aimed at children may be construed as a sign of psychological maladjustment or arrested development.13 Francie indeed remains childlike across decades, a 11.

The comics mark his physical isolation in solitary confinement as he is left to find solace and stimulation in the pages of Beano. However, they also signal his more pervasive exclusion from successful interpersonal relations. He possesses the skills to engage with his comics, but not the skills to participate fully in adult interactions. When informed that his solitary confinement is end ing soon, for example, Francie exclaims, "I felt like laughing in his face. How can your solitary finish? That's the best laugh yet" (BB 230). Francie's remark ironi cally proves that he is at least partially aware of his own limitations. This is his only moment of such clarity and it is far too late to matter. Francie's lapses into psychological problems coincide with the fossilization of his childlike outlook across time. Moreover, McCabe links Francie's multiple isolations—within society, within prison, and within the mind—and his atten dant stagnation in the mental state and cultural sphere of childhood, to his rela tionship with comic books. Importantly, Francie's psychopathology does end at social maladjustment and a slow developmental trajectory; he exhibits extremely violent tendencies as the novel progresses. The troubling progression of Fran cie's maladjustment to the real world and the rise of his violence can be traced in the development of his striking comix idiom. Francie's slippage into comix at first echoes his general confusion between reality and fantasy, which occurs long before he exhibits truly violent behavior. For example, while listening to adults talking in the living room Francie blends their words with what is happening on the television screen: Oh they're a terror the men, a terror now to the living world. All was left of John was a cloud of dust and the desert pocked with hoofmarks. I've a bit of business to do said da, you'll be alright, and handed me two bob. (BB 9) Here, dialogue and scenes lifted from the John Wayne Western on the television repeatedly interrupt Francie's version of events. Such intrusions make his narra tive difficult to interpret at times as he seamlessly integrates marginalia into the main narrative with ambiguous or absent punctuation. Eventually, he cannot make distinctions between the voices of his family and neighbors and the voices emanating from the television: It was hard to make out the other voices with the noise of the telly.... For a min ute I didn't catch on that it was me and Joe she was talking about at all, I got it mixed up with the woman on the telly. (BB 144) Francie thus fails to delineate appropriately the variety of voices in his environ ment; his imagination, alongside the visual material and soundscapes of popu lar entertainment, competes with reality. These narrative confusions and am 98</page><page sequence="7">Narrating through Comics in Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy biguities mark Francie's descent into psychopathy and paranoia; moreover, the slippage between imagination, media, and reality in Francie's experience finds further development in McCabe's pervasive use of comix in Francie's language. Comix governs Francie's speech patterns and exists in the deep structure of the scenes that he describes, as McCabe employs several graphic elements and con ventions appropriate to comic books: descriptions of static action, verbal sound effects, and word balloons. Comix is, thus, an essential framework for decoding and understanding Francie's idiosyncratic outlook on the world. McCabe transfers the static action of sequential art to Francie's language. For example, Francie observes, "Whee-hoo! cried Joe and a big shower of spiky sunlight arrows coming through the gaps in the trees when you chinked your eyes" (BB 22). Later, he sets the scene with "Big whorly clouds made of ink pow der riding the sky and the music book stuck in my back pocket. Then the school rising up out of the fields with all its yellow windows gleaming" (BB 197). These extracts, representative of the novel's narrative style at large, reveal a lack of aux iliary verbs in many of the descriptions; McCabe uses gerund-like constructions or stand-alone participles in the place of complete verbal clauses. In this way, McCabe creates text-bytes or sentences that seem to be missing active transi tions between images. Such writing mimics the movement from panel to panel in a comic book spread of sequential pictures. The reader must, as when faced with a true comic book, provide progression and movement to supplement the suspended action of Francie's image-descriptions. Francie's narration also contains sound effects that would be more likely to appear in a comic book than in a novel. In comics, words like "BANG" are used to add sound—a sensory dimension generally unavailable to the printed medi um.14 Sound effects in prose are not Patrick McCabe's own innovation, yet he includes an astonishing array of mostly monosyllabic auditory and visual code words: "bumph!" (BB 119), "swish swish" (BB 92), "Pop" (BB 98), "Twang!" (BB uo), "flop flop flop" BB (122), "Blam!" BB (134), "Ting-a-ling! whistle whistle bark bark" (BB 135), "flip" (BB 92), Flick" (BB 15) "scribble scribble" (BB 156). Suspended in the narrative, theses sounds alert the reader to influence of the sensory strategies of the comic strip. The most recognizable element of the modern comic book is the conjunc tion of word and image, which includes not just text boxes and captions but also the speech balloon. Throughout The Butcher Boy, scenery is interrupted by verbal expression that is seamlessly integrated within Francie's recollections, without punctuation, as though the words originated within the visual sphere 14. See Will Eisner, Comics and Sequential Art (Tamarac, FL: Poorhouse Press, 1985), p. 18. 99</page><page sequence="8">Narrating through Comics in Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy of his memory.15 Francie registers audible speech in unison with his other ob servations and ideas, without always demarcating them from the rest of his text and without differentiating clearly between his own voice and that of others. Indeed, the function of the word balloon within a comic book is to establish a tight "word/image unity" within the topography and cognitive experience of the page; a unity that distinguishes comics from other illustrated texts. The seamless, or confusing, cohesion of speech and observation in Francie's narrative suggests the wanton translation of such "word/image unity" into prose.16 Although speech balloons in comic books are bound up in the generation of the image-plane's meaning, they nonetheless present themselves in a different plane from the pictures: "They are neither entirely within the picture space nor outside it."17 In other words, "we would not see them if we could stand there in the picture; and usually the characters, who are standing there, cannot see them." The word balloon thus manifests a "radical indeterminacy," as it is not exactly part of the action—an indeterminacy hidden in plain sight by the automatized reading strategies that make the words and images of a comic book cohere so seamlessly in the mind of a reader.18 Francie, however, moves dangerously close to imagining the word balloon itself in his own plane of existence in reality. While watching Philip Nugent sleeping, Francie claims that "If there was a word bubble coming out of his mouth I knew what would be written in it. I love my mother more than anything in the world and I'd never do anything in the world to hurt her. I love my parents and I love my happy home" (BB 47). Francie ex plicitly imagines literalizing the verbal strategy of the comic book. Moreover, through this word bubble Francie has the power to accentuate, exaggerate, and mock Philip's smugly perfect household; a creative act that vilifies Philip further. Francie's act of supplying thoughts and words here is encouraged by conven tions of comic book storytelling, for word balloons do not guarantee the replay of every single word in a given verbal exchange or thought process. Some panels include no text boxes or word balloons at all, and the cognitive gaps between images and explicit narration or speech continually force the reader to "supply the dialogue."19 The rifts between image, word, and reader thus allow a signifi cant degree of creative improvisation; as David Carrier writes, the "meaning of a comic is determined not by the artist but by the audience."20 Francie's actions lay 15- As Eisner observes, the mixture of words and images is not new; in fact, their juxtaposition has been utilized since medieval times, with a dramatic resurgence in the eighteenth century on broad sheets and other popular publications.

Carrier, p. 7. 100</page><page sequence="9">Narrating through Comics in Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy bare the structures of representation and interpretation encountered by readers of comic books. However, Francie also manipulates those structures; in deploy ing the word bubble as he watches Philip sleep, he imagines the word balloon within the plane of the actual world rather than representational world where it belongs. He uses and abuses the convention of the speech balloon in order to see things that are not truly there—making him not only a listener and viewer but also the omnipotent creator of his environment. Francie is not merely a reader of his comic-inflected world but also the artist and author. The misrepresentation of others, and the inflammatory supply of dialogue, directly leads to Francie's error-ridden understanding of his surroundings. Start ing early in the novel, McCabe signals the preponderance of Francie's self-sup plied subject matter—the narrowness of insight that his sustained monologue allows—by setting the scene in a way that mimics the "splash page" or front cover of a comic book. The splash page functions as a launching pad for the story and establishes a "frame of reference" and narrative "climate" that directs the reader's expectations and attitude towards the events that follow.21 Tellingly, Mc Cabe foregrounds Francie's restricted point of view from inside the "hide" (BB1) at the opening of the novel, allowing the reader to extrapolate an important cog nitive insight from this first image of Francie Brady. We see not Francie himself but his panel of vision—the delimited page upon which he draws and writes— that fixes the narrow point of view of the entire narrative. His constricted per spective in this stance echoes his lack of access to theory of mind (also known as mind reading); the inadequate socio-cognitive skills that ensue allow Francie to misread and misrepresent the intentions and feelings of others. Neil Jordan's film adaptation of The Butcher Boy, with a screenplay by Neil Jordan and Patrick McCabe, picks up many of these comic book resonances. The film is framed by comic book graphics. The opening credits unfold against a background of comic book image stills, all in shades of angry red that set the tone and content of the story: there are cowboys, superheroes, and fighting men, scenes of war with tanks and explosions, and frightened faces. The last image shows an anonymous person in a hospital bed, plastered from head to toe, and then the graphics fade into the opening scene itself in which we learn that it is Francie in the bed, with only one reddened eye visible through a gap in the bandages. Here there is a literal slippage between Francie as a graphic creation, and Francie as a real boy. Furthermore, the emphasis on the sole visible body part—the eye—resonates with his singular, restricted, and restricting point of view that unfolds across the narrative. Indeed, through McCabe's deliberate and strategic linguistic choices, the representational conventions of comic books lie deep within Francie's cogni 2i. Eisner, p. 62. 101</page><page sequence="10">Narrating through Comics in Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy tive processing and translation of the world around him into narrative. Francie's comic book idiom neither exists as a mere idiosyncrasy nor amounts to a creative nod to pop culture. The comic books in Francie's immediate cultural sphere both feed into and allow him to exteriorize his mental life. As for any language user, his linguistic projections are colored by the input from the environment. Yet be cause he relies on comix, the language of the graphic narrative, Francie in some ways comprises his own linguistic subgroup. Comic books have allowed Francie to receive and to author his world in a mode unfamiliar to most of speakers in his environment, contributing to his further isolation and mental disintegration. The class issues developed in Francie's isolating, self-made world deserve more attention. In Francie's projection of Philip's self-commentary, he places himself on the latter end of the have-and-have-not spectrum, which serves to intensify his feelings of victimization. In other words, Francie's ventriloquism— his projection of speech into Philip—defines and delimits his social position in pathological ways. Nowhere is Francie's self-denigration more apparent than in his adoption of the label of "pig" Francie's array of self-produced comic book characters includes Algernon Carruthers Brady and The Fugitive; however, his most prominent role is Francie Pig, a member of the "Pig Family" (BB 5). The pig appears early in Francie's self-stylization, after Mrs. Nugent comes to com plain about the theft of Philip's comics. He hears "Nugent going down the lane and calling back Pigs—sure the whole town knows that!" {BB 4). Francie quickly internalizes the slur, calling himself the Pig Toll Tax Man and performing as a pig at the Nugents' front door: "I stuck out my face and scrunched up my nose and made my eyes as small as I could then I gave a big grunt" (BB 58). At the height of his derangement, while pushing his meat cart through the streets shortly after the murder, Francie calls out in a stream of confusion, "I am a little baby pig I'll have you all to know. Yes this is the Baby Pig Show broadcasting on Raydeeoh Lux-em-Bourg!" (BB 211). The character Francie Pig persists all the way through The Butcher Boy and marks his obsessive social paranoia: "As long as I walked the streets under them stars there'd be only one thing anyone could say about me and that was: I hope he's proud of himself now, the pig, after what he did on his poor mother" (BB 47). Francie has a knack for creating an unflattering and fixed rep resentation of himself as a pig in the eyes and words of others. The results of his own creative agency are increasing paranoia and decreasing feelings of self-worth. Although the comic book seemingly provides a powerfully contempo rary representational form, McCabe forces it to carry the burden of the past as the Irish pig stereotype continues to inform Francie's twentieth-century self-consciousness.22 Furthermore, in acting as a pig, Francie embodies, per 21. Both Donna Potts and Henry Sussman have discussed the significance of pigs in The Butcher Boy. Potts observes that by associating the Bradys with pigs McCabe "alludes to the long English tra 102</page><page sequence="11">Narrating through Comics in Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy forms, and even searches out the label that debases him and marks him as a shameful, marginal, and expendable member of society. He fashions a tradi tional Irish abjection into a mask. Once brought into custody by the police, for example, Francie reveals his tendency to look for the reflection of himself as a pig in the eyes of others. He misreads a newspaper headline: There was a drawing of me standing there and underneath Francis Brady is a pig. Fuck this I says even the papers are at it now but there was another bit I didn't see; Francis Brady is a pig butcher in a local abattoir. {BB 228) As in his creative ventriloquism of Philip's speech, Francie unwittingly manipu lates the newspaper to reflect his own self-perception and sees himself as illus tration and caption rather than flesh, mind, and speech. In this way, the comic books in Francie's immediate cultural sphere not only encourage a comix-in flected point of view, but also allow him to express his deepest social, cultural, and psychological insecurities through role-play. In other words, the representa tional strategies and limitations of the comic book provide Francie with a frame work for projecting his own fantasy, imagination, and pathology onto the real environment, which ultimately results in a motive for murder. McCabe's portrayal of violence itself in The Butcher Boy has comic book ori gins. The conventions of comic book stories allow the development of Francie's quarrel with the world into the terms of struggle between hero and villain. Al though the neglect and abuse of Francie comes from a variety of diffuse sources, the child builds Mrs. Nugent into an all-encompassing force of evil; a nemesis, or quintessential comic book "baddie." Francie's descriptions of Mrs. Nugent's face and expressions, especially with respect to anger, often allude to graphic design. For example, her pursed mouth makes her look as though she has "bits of scribbles" (BB 55) for lips and they become "so thin you really would think they were drawn with a pencil" (BB 12). Francie reports that when she opens her front door to find him standing there, a "crinkly arrow appeared over her eyes in the middle of her forehead and she said what do you want. No she said what do you want" (BB 56). McCabe also employs the close-up that so often occurs at moments of in tense emotion in comic books. While Mrs. Nugent is trying to comfort him after his mother's suicide, Francie recounts "what does she do only lean right into me dition of drawing a distinction between England and Ireland in the form of John Bull and Paddy the Pig." Donna Potts, "From Tir na nög to Tir na Muck: Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy," New Hi bernia Review, 3,3 (Autumn, 1999), 87. Sussman writes that as an "insult and internal social marker, 'pig' derives from a vision of the Irish community that, although instrumented by Mrs. Nugent, is ultimately British in origin: one starkly divided between acceptable, socialized Irish and shanty Irish, or pigs." Henry Sussman, "On the Butcher Block: A Panorama of Social Marking," New Centennial Review, 4,1 (Spring, 2004), 159. 103</page><page sequence="12">Narrating through Comics in Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy she was so close I could see the wiry hairs on her chin and the pink makeup and powder on her cheeks" (BB 46). In this moment Mrs. Nugent's face uncomfort ably intrudes into Francie's visual field; he cannot or does not hear what she is saying, he only feels threatened and sees her "stringy mouth" moving (BB 46). Eisner writes that, according to comix convention, "Facial expressions affecting the narrative require close-ups."23 The heightened emotional affect and minimal informational content of this moment is telling: Francie cannot narrate what is happening or what Mrs. Nugent is saying, but instead remains fixated on her horrifying and witchy face. Because of his social training in the pages of his comics, he interprets the potentially empathetic gesture as an aggressive act. No tably, neuroscientific research has found that even simple line drawings of facial expressions activate quick subcortical responses before slower cognitive process ing in the neocortex. Thus, facial expressions depicted in comics and graphic narratives can elicit strong emotional reader-responses before the content of the accompanying text comes into play.24 Similarly, comic books seem to have prompted Francie's misreading of the subtleties and nuances of the real social world—in this case, he misreads Mrs. Nugent's affect—in part because he is ac customed to the stylized depictions of emotional states in his comic books. The conventions of graphic representation provide yet another loophole through which Francie misreads his surroundings. The comic book gives Francie a vo cabulary to interpret and characterize Mrs. Nugent as his nemesis, which in turn helps him to direct his anger and retaliation against the world onto one manage able target. When Francie recounts the murder itself, his memory is marked by a fantasy of superhero power. In addition to his extreme strength in lifting her with one hand, and the chilling sound effect, "thlok" (BB 209), Francie even provides jus tification for his crimes by prefacing the execution with a simple accusation and judgment of her of wrongdoing: "You did two bad things Mrs. Nugent..." (BB 209). In this way, Francie neatly fits her into the paradigm of guilt and rightful punishment, and to him the murder appears as a triumphant moment when social and personal justice prevails. McCabe tellingly likens the sound of the kill, "thlok," to a goldfish dropping into a bowl. Francie previously became fixated on the fact that Joe accepted a goldfish that Philip won at the carnival; it is act of betrayal so great that "The more I tried to get the goldfish out of my head the more it kept coming back" (BB 100). The goldfish embodies Francie's loss of Joe; it symbolizes Joe's change in allegiance from Francie to Philip Nugent. At the moment of her death Mrs. Nugent has been punished for this act too, thereby 23. Eisner, p. 21. 24.

Jordan's film adaptation again capitalizes upon the novel's comic book sig nals, especially with respect to the characterization of Mrs Nugent as the vil lain. The film consistently uses a green color palette, which is further accentu ated by Mrs. Nugent. When we first meet her leaning out of a window, shouting at Francie, she wears a bright green blouse and cardigan. Next, she appears in a green translucent raincoat that almost makes her appear to be covered in a monstrous green ooze. She wears green accessories—green pearls or large green disk-shaped earrings—and she has unmistakably bright green eyes, of which the strategic close-ups ensure that we take note. Altogether, such costume choices become pervasive visual cues that contribute to our coding of her character as the ruling villain. Not only do comix and comic books inform the organizing action of the novel, and the definitive villainous nature of Mrs. Nugent that leads to her de mise, but the genesis of his violence also begins with that medium. Early in the novel, Francie lures Philip to the chicken house and attempts to beat him with a chain. His deployment of the comic book as both trap and weapon begins as follows: Then I told him about the comics I got from my Aunt in America. Comics like you never seen in your whole life, I said. Not English ones, you couldn't get these in England or anywhere, oh no—only America. You just never seen the like of them Philip I told him. I have them all stashed in the chickenhouse, Philip, I said. I went there every day and what a laugh I had reading about all these superheroes. Your man comes at Green Lantern I says. Next thing bam! a big giant hammer comes flying out of his ring and splatters him. And that's only Green Lantern. There's far more than him that could do even better things than that! (BB 51) Comics are the bait that Francie uses to lure Philip into the chickenhouse. More over, Francie's delinquent behavior can be traced to the fantasy social relations portrayed in comic books. Hajdu, for example, describes the allure of the un touchable superhero, who undermines the authority and the dignity of the or dinary man and woman and prompts fantasies of seeing other people suffer ing while remaining immune from punishment.25 Unfortunately for all those involved, Francie forgets that—outside a comic book—he is a violent juvenile delinquent rather than an untouchable superhero. The hypothesis that comic books contribute to juvenile delinquency has a long history, beginning in the 1930s in the United States when the first modern comics appeared. The potential menace of comics was a highly charged debate 25- See Hajdu, pp. 236,264. 105</page><page sequence="14">Narrating through Comics in Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy in Britain and America in the 1940s and 1950s, the very years running up to the main events of McCabe's The Butcher Boy. Early on, the medium was thought to contribute to lower reading skills in children. The psychiatrist Fredric Wer tham, for example, in his luridly titled attack Seduction of the Innocent (1954), famously accused comic books of coarsening youthful sensibilities: "Comic book readers are handicapped in vocabulary building because in comics all the emphasis is on the visual image and not on the proper word."26 When this criticism took an increasingly sociological turn in the mid-twentieth century, the opponents of the comic book in the United States vehemently argued that it led to juvenile delinquency.27 Wertham again critiqued the comic book in "Horror in the Nursery," a polemic piece published in Collier's Magazine in March 1948, in which he warned parents that comic books were linked with delinquent and disturbed children in his clinical experience.28 At the same time other experts—such as the child psychiatrist Dr. Laura Bender—established alternative stances on the social evils of comic books. In 1941, Bender claimed that the comic is "the folklore of the times, spontaneously given to children and received by children, serving at the same time as a means of helping them solve the individual and sociological problems appropriate to their own lives."29 Bender asserted that "horrible scenes" do not adversely affect well-balanced children as long as the logic and reasoning of the situation is well stated. In fact, the controversy prompted the creation of regulatory institutions to police and censor comic book distribution. By 1955, the British cabinet passed a "Harmful Publications" clause in the Children and Young Persons Act, prohibit ing horror comics and any publication that would incite violence, cruelty, and corruption among young persons. Newspapers and magazines entered the war on comics asking such questions as "Should US Comics be banned?"30 Yet, the impact of the comic book on the twentieth-century Irish childhood is under examined. While Britain bemoaned the influence of the comic book on youth culture and sought to regulate the appearance of certain comics on the shelves of newsagents and in the hands of British children, Ireland remained comparatively silent on the subject. Working within this silence, McCabe's 1992 novel does draw an important distinction between American and British comics: in effect, he indicts the former as a pollutant in Irish society. On one end of the spectrum lies the mischievous Dennis the Menace from the British Beano, who gets up to relatively benign childhood tricks such as 26.

On the other end of the spectrum we find the more vio lent American superheroes such as Green Lantern or Human Torch, who wield weapons to "splat" their enemies. Indeed, 1950s Britain was specifically con cerned with the damaging effects of American comics.31 McCabe is particularly careful to suture the American comic to violence when Francie lures Philip into the chickenhouse. In fact, an American backdrop looms large over the novel's events in small-town Ireland, and Francie shows vulnerability to the influence of American culture. For example, the extensive John Wayne and "injun" refer ences are part of a framework of American "chivalric codes of loyalty" entering his world through American artifacts of mass production and appeal.32 Even Francie's family name, Brady, is fully comprehensible only when placed against the backdrop of American popular culture; it ironizes the widely disseminated, and famously treacly television show, "The Brady Bunch."33 The American politi cal sphere also infiltrates the general atmosphere of Ireland in The Butcher Boy. A portrait of John F. Kennedy hangs on the wall of the Nugents' drawing room, and later, the Cuban Missile Crisis looms in the international background. When Francie sees a newspaper headline, "Crisis in Cuba—New Fears," he quickly channels an American superhero persona to act out his fantasy confrontation: I wanted to leap into the air like Green Lantern or the Human Torch and land at Humpty's table. Ok Humpty let's talk about your brother! I want the lowdown on these communists and I want it now! (BB187) Here, McCabe shows an awareness of the role of comic books in serving the political needs of a given moment. As Hajdu observes, Captain America was de picted "punching out Hitler himself on the cover of his first issue in March 1941" and following events at Pearl Harbor "almost every superhero stopped fighting traditional crime, abandoning murderers, kidnappers, and bank robbers to focus on saboteurs, spies, scientists working for the axis, and other domestic threats."34 Comics can serve as propaganda and provide an inflammatory outlet and ve hicle for political issues—a function that Francie acts out in his own response to the Cuban Missile Crisis. McCabe thus capitalizes upon the political potential of comics in The Butcher Boy by using them to reveal, at the social and cultural level, the far reach of American political issues in the international community. In this way, McCabe positions The Butcher Boy as a document for under 31. The early 1960s setting of The Butcher Boy is important in this context, as McCabe does not need to acknowledge the explosion of Japanese manga on the English-speaking sector of comic book culture. Japanese comics took the European market by storm in the 1990s but this is absent by default from The Butcher Boy, allowing McCabe to focus on the transatlantic market. 32. Sussman,i49. 33.

Hajdu, p. 55. 107</page><page sequence="16">Narrating through Comics in Patrick McCabe's The Butcher Boy standing the position of Ireland between English and American influences in an increasingly global system of cultural exchange. The role of the American comic book in mid-twentieth century Irish culture might have much to say about the shaping of this transatlantic cultural narrative. The Butcher Boy appears to present a small-town Irish childhood, albeit a strikingly bleak and traumatic small-town Irish childhood. But by looking more closely at the way that McCabe exploits the apparatus of the American comic book in Francie's testimony, the transnational significance of McCabe's haunting novel comes into focus. By deploying comix in Francie's act of life writing, McCabe also prompts readers to think about the potential for effective creative expression through the graphic vocabulary, asking whether the graphic form can bear the weight of the serious social and cultural issues that the novel raises. This question was close at hand at the time of The Butcher Boy's publication in 1992, when Art Spiegelman's Maus was awarded a Pulitzer Prize. Attitudes varied toward Spiegelman's comic book account of the Holocaust and its aftermath because the "genre seemed to represent a degradation of the tragic legacy of the Holocaust and its comic nature appeared to be in contradiction with the seriousness of the topic."35 In addition, the comic raised questions about genre itself; Spiegelman received a special citation Pulitzer, rather than the prize for autobiography, biography, gen eral non-fiction, or fiction. Maus traversed and complicated all the boundaries between the rubrics. Although The Butcher Boy is neither a comic book nor a graphic novel, McCabe also traverses the boundaries between forms by virtue of his narrative and linguistic strategies. More than fifty years before McCabe's novel, Will Eisner claimed that the comic strip is "in reality, an illustrated novel. It is a new and raw in form just now, but material for limitless intelligent development. And eventually and inevitably it will be a legitimate medium for the best of writers and artists."36 In 1985, Eisner once again proclaimed the medium's potential, writing in Comics and Sequential Art that the "future of the graphic novel lies in the choice of worthwhile themes and the innovation of exposition."37 McCabe subtly enters The Butcher Boy in the graphic novel's developmental trajectory. The comic book informs Fran cie's idiosyncratic worldview and his understanding of his own place in society. Comic books also provide the instruments with which he finds himself capable of committing acts of violence. Finally, they provide a linguistic mode for writ ing his story. Patrick McCabe constructs a voice for Francie Brady that attempts to contain him within a prose narrative, yet Francie's graphic mental landscape 35- Stanislav Kolâr, "The Holocaust as a Comic Book: Art Spiegelman's Maus!'

The array of conventions, vocabulary, and grammar that McCabe borrows from the comic book culminate in the emergence of a hero villain: Francie Brady, The Butcher Boy. McCabe presents a novel about child hood, mental breakdown, trauma, crime, Ireland's institutions, and the wider social fabric. Yet The Butcher Boy may be most of all about representation itself, and an intervention in the evolution of a linguistic apparatus—the language of comix—that we may ask to carry personal and national expression in the literary and artistic realm.
