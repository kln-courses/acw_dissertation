<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter Sansom We Knew We'd Live Forever Of course a poem always depends on what you bring to it, but the poems in Birthday Letters depend more than most, more than any maybe, because of what they don't say. Like the novel of a film, much of the characterisation and background is taken as read. That makes 'Daffodils' difficult to talk about separated not just from its book, but from the story we bring to the book. Not that Hughes has traded on this: he leaves things out, it s true ? because the reader knows them already ? but the reader isn't you or me. The poems after all are letters. This one opens with the familiar formula of inviting a correspondent to re live an event, or to reassess the time it brings to mind: 'Remember... ?' But the correspondent can't reply, whether she remembers or not. It brings to mind Les Murray's elegy for his mother ('Midsummer Ice') which ends, "but you don't remember. I will have to die before you remember", and is moving in the same way. As with the Murray and as the repetition in 'Daffodils' suggests, it is no idle or merely rhetorical question. Not even Hughes's daughter can remember ? corroborate? ? the daffodil picking, though she brought "armfuls, eager and happy". So it is as if it never happened. Plath's journals prove it did, and on just how large a scale: "we went in the early dusk to deliver our great weekly bouquet of daffodils ..." and, for a funeral, "Last night we picked about 150 daffodils . . "l. "Remember", repeated in the first few lines, is parallelled by repetition of "sold", making a subliminal connection between what are the twin themes of the poem. Selling the daffodiL is a sort of "sacrilege", as he says, and working at it and in the wrong spirit (as if for someone else, lines 31 33) is worse. By line 50 Hughes is explicit about this: "We sold them to wither" ? which carries the sense of 'in order that they wither' ? as if by not selling them the writers might have maintained access to "the everlasting" (25) which the daffodils represent. This in turn is connected to the writers' sense of^themselves as people who will live forever (line 24), through their verse, presumably, and it strikes me this is the real interest of the poem, a questioning of literary immortality. However that is, the poem recognises the attitude as naive: "We knew we'd live forever. We had not learned . . . ". The daffodils may offer only a "fleeting glance/ of the everlasting", but are themselves in a sense immortal, because they are 48 Poetry Ireland Review 61</page><page sequence="2">reborn, as the image in line 55 implies, "Out of the same bulbs, the same/ Baby-cries from the thaw"; which is to say they re-emerge from "the deep graves stony cold" (line 48). Each April, as the ending supposes, the daffodils "return" to remind him that they too have forgotten: but the flowers have not forgotten her, only the fact that she cut them: They return to forget you stooping there Behind the rainy curtains of a dark April Snipping their stems. Its a strong image because of the tension created by the idea of the daffodils recalling something they cant remember. Though she did pick the flowers, they're now able to return unhurt, thereby cancelling the negative image she projected at the time (and which the language now rehearses in 'rainy' and 'dark' and especially in 'stooping with its play on the sense of "lowering oneself by unworthy behaviour" [Chambers]), Though the first line is regular iambic pentameter and the rest of the poem depends on ? departs from ? that measure, 'Daffodils' is free verse governed by spoken rhythms. It has irregular line-lengths and is laid out in verse paragraphs again of different lengths, parcelled out as content demands, each stanza closed off with a full-stop. (The exception, which is important ? and is discussed briefly below ? occurs at stanza five, where a parenthesis is lent prominence as a separate quatrain.) The effect of this informal layout is to give a sense of spontaneity and plainspeaking (as opposed to the considered artifice of a patterned form); and it is supported by colloquial language and conversational idiom ("Were we so poor?"; "Besides .,.") and by short sentences ? lines 4 and 5 for instance which read like afterthoughts. Though in this way it gives the impression of someone thinking aloud, the poem is not prosey. Each and every line is tautened by alliteration or assonance and many by both, often modulating across lines, and accompanied by repetition. The monotonous effort of picking is made vivid in stanza three, for instance: You bent at it In the rain of that April ? your last April, We bent there together, .. , Here, the insistence of the Ixl sounds ("ben* a? if) gives way to the short Poetry Ireland Review 61 49</page><page sequence="3">Ill which straddles the line: "/t" to "m"; at which point the consonant is taken up: "i?" goes to "raiw" and from there, like passing the baton, the vowel becomes active when the long /a/ in "rain" recurs in "April". The word "April" takes further emphasis from another assonance, underlining the significance of its recurrence: "of that April" is rhymed with "your last April", the month of promise and renewal vouchsafed by the new-flower ing daffodils (and gainsayed by their harvesting). There are more obvious examples: stanza three's, . . . soft shrieks Of their jostled stems, the wet shocks shaken Of their girlish dance-frocks ? for instance, where the sound values are so densely interrelated it seems inevitable that assonance and consonance will throw up the occasional internal rhyme, though this one is particularly striking, arriving as a hidden (heard but not seen) tetrameter couplet, both lines closing on a spondee: "Of their jostled stems, the wet shocks) (shaken/ Of their girlish dance frocks ?". Commonly these sonic devices are in the service of anthropomorphism or as here a personification which elicits reader-involvement. Worth noting that the effect in this passage as elsewhere is more subtly achieved and more complex than it looks: the broad, watercolour strokes of those otherwise Disney dance-frocks are prepared for by the discreet personifi cation of "jostled", for instance. And stanza four's "Buckling blade leaves, limber, groping for air ..." is similarly richly textured and the picture so close-focus as to be magnified, but the language is even more muscular and active. Although the opening underplays its imagery, and though the poem avoids simile almost altogether, there is a tremendous pressure of metaphor throughout. Simile draws attention to the writer at work (making overt comparisons); metaphor by-passes the writer and seems rather to enact comparisons. The first instance of this occurs in line 8, where "Old Stoneman" is described, "his blood-pressure purpling to beetroot". The strangled energy of this image is due partly to the noun used as a verb, partly to the patterns of /b/s and /p/s marshalled into dactyls, blood-pressure/purpling to/beetroot(-). 50 Poetry Ireland Review 61</page><page sequence="4">"Purpling" is effective here too because it contradicts the common saying (which is subliminally present in the line), that someone goes red as a beetroot', Mr. Stoneman the grocer knows well enough what colour beetroots really are, or the blood pressure does. The syntax is interesting at this point in the poem, and makes the reader wonder what else the grocer knows and prefers to keep to himself. After several short, straight forward sentences, "Old Stoneman" is described through relative clauses which complicate and delay the sense till the last three words, "he persuaded us". Clearly Hughes feels they were wrong to be persuaded. There is something dodgy about Stoneman taking his "chance". The slang and singularly unattractive term, "Boss-eyed", shows he literally cannot see straight (it also carries the secondary meaning of "crooked" [O.E.D.]) He sees well enough to appeal to tradition, though, and so the stanza ends on the clinching minor sentence, "A custom of the house". Despite the parenthetic clauses in this passage, the first stanza is either endstopped or the lines break with the sense, so that when the second opens with two strong enjambements ?". , . wanted to own/ Anything" and "hungry/ To convert . . ." ? the uppercase start to each line really pulls its weight and the end words take a lot of stress. The concepts of ownership and hunger seem linked by the lineation in this way, though the second enjambement is a feint ? reading as a complete unit of sense and misleading the reader about the nature of the hunger. The writers were not hungry and, this device suggests, were mistaken in acting as though they might be: in their situation selling the daffodils seems not prudence but greed for "profit", defining themselves through money, or the safety they believe money affords. And this is at odds with the feet that they didn't wish to "own/ Anything". I think the heavy stress here on "own" signals a second meaning as in 4to confess (to)' or accept (as true)'. Its not that they deliberately committed what now "sounds like sacrilege"; at the time they simply didn't think in those terms, or didn't feel able to. For those readers who don't accept that cutting flowers constitutes "sacrilege", the poem may seem overinsistent ? the book as a whole has been criticised along these lines ? in projecting human failings onto a mumbo jumbo of fatalism, or at best may be read as an exploration of the inner life through external symbols, a way of making sense of events beyond the writers control. The fact seems to be though that for Hughes (and presumably Plath) the intuited world (glimpsed for instance through myth) was actually primary experience, as real and ordinary and amazing as poems, where they come from, what they do. Poetry Ireland Review 61 51</page><page sequence="5">Biography informs our reading of the poem, but just as important is the significance Hughes surely puts upon the flowers as living symbol Fortunately for mc, there isnt room here to look very .for into the daffodil the yellow narcissus, the d'affodil [ME], or asphodel us [L], that U the asphodel a mythical undying flower, and the Elysian fields where it was said to bloom, "a happy place where there is neither snow nor cold nor rain, and where favoured mortals pass without dying" (as the classi cal dictionary says). It is certain that the translator of Ovid and author of The Goddess of 'Complete Being will have understood the presence of myth in that flower, and what the "sacrilege" encompassed, and how it attaches to the idea of poets *liv[ingj forever'. Also therefore to the writers' unwill ingness to "own1 what they did selling the "flamy purification of the deep graves stony cold". And, though it must look tenuous spelled out, he will have registered at some level that it was a stone man who traded on the \ustom of the house". That seems as clear, to me at any rate, as the irony that they cut the living flowers with their "wedding present scissors". The scissors become a symbol by the last line that anchors itself, and what it represents* to the earth the image sinks through, powerless and vulnera ble ? "wide-open" ? because, though harmless now with rust, they cant forget, Whats more it strikes me as impossible that, in seeing those "girlish dance frocks" and "ballerinas too- early for music", Hughes wont have recognised the "host of dancing daffodils" (as the first version of that famous line ran2) like a photograph negative behind his own poem. The earlier laureates flowers, written up partly from his sister's journal, incorporate Mary Wordsworths insight that the daffodils "flash upon that inward eye/;Which is the bliss of solitude". In Wordsworths poem3, the flowers are a "host": angels who welcome and help conduct the process which, as his wife saw, is fundamental to composition, a * wealth" the writer has come to understand is the poetic "bliss" that is recollection in tranquillity. Hughes first wife may have seen it too, though if she did, while cutting the daffodils, he is alone in remembering it; at that time, his new life, his new poems, like the scissors, were wide-open, still waiting to be found* lj(mrrmk BalUtinc Boob, New York, 1982: 342 (published only in America but available in Britain). ?Hob$baum: Uftra&amp;utfrtA^ ;,wThc two best lines in it art* by Mary": 'Wordsworth to Isabella Fen wick, quoted Hobsfaum, ibid: 240, 52 Poetry Ireland Review 61</page></plain_text>
