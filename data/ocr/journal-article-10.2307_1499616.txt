<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rodeo: An Anthropologist Looks at the Wild and the Tame. By ELIZABETH AT- WOOD LAWRENCE. (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1982. Pp. xi + 288. References, index, illustrations. $19.50.) Folklorists, oral historians, and students of popular culture have recently given rodeo and ranching culture a degree of attention which might seem all out of proportion to the subject were it not that scholars, like other people, respond to popular trends. Not surprisingly, some of the more suc- cessful popularizers in the current cowboy mania have also begun to see themselves as scholars. Aaron Latham, author of the novelization- screenplay-magazine article Urban Cowboy, declares in a dust jacket blurb: "When I first walked into Gilley's, I felt, on the one hand, like a native son, and on the other, like Margaret Mead stepping ashore in Samoa for the first time."' Even scholars who address popular audiences need not ca- pitulate to such ballyhoo. Anthropology in particular involves more than pasting a good-guy-gets-the-girl plot onto new journalistic reportage. 1.

Ms. Lawrence ap- proaches the subject as a collective ritual text which can be read, after the manner of Clifford Geertz, "over the shoulders" of the participants and the audience. She traces the development of the contemporary sport from Wild West performances and contests among working cowboys, sets it in the context of ranching and the cattle industry, and draws comparisons with other stock-raising societies such as the Fulani and the Nuer. The chief focus of the book, however, is on the relationships of humans and animals in rodeo. The horse, Ms. Lawrence asserts, embodies a continuum between the wild and the tame, and thus serves "as a symbolic bridge between nature and culture" (p. 132). The nearly wild bucking broncs exemplify most fully the spirit and values of rodeo. In conquering broncs, cowboys extend the domain of culture into nature; the "outlaw" image of the broncs, however, symbolizes the freedom from social constraint with which the cowboys identify. Rodeo horses become, finally, sacrificial victims, forced into rituals of resistance so that cowboys may vanquish them. Cattle, which lack the anthropomorphic qualities of horses, serve to measure man's susceptibility to wildness. Bulls in particular impart some- thing of their savagery to the cowboys who ride them. Bull riding consti- tutes a thematic distillation of masculine frontier ritual, an overt contest between man and animal which affirms that some wildness remains to be conquered. In addition, the power and sexual attributes of bulls call forth the most strongly held opinions about the roles of men and women in rodeo. Men especially oppose the idea of women bull riders, although there are some, usually confined to all-girls' rodeos. With few exceptions, men consider bulls too dangerous for women. Conversely, "women appear to sense, with underlying alarm, the deep-seated male exclusiveness implied by this event" (p. 193). The subordination of women in rodeo and ranching cul- ture recurs as a persistent theme throughout the book. An important dimension of Rodeo lies in the author's carefully main- tained stance as a cultural outsider to her subject. Spelling out her creden- tials as a veterinarian and a former participant in formal equestrian shows, Ms. Lawrence writes about establishing rapport with her informants and preserves their anonymity in a fashion characteristic of social anthropolo- gists studying "exotic" cultures. In doing so, she tests the possibilities of anthropology in a highly visible arena of American culture. The outcome is, by and large, a positive one. The ethnological perspec- tive adds significantly to previous studies of rodeo, and the cross-cultural comparisons with the Fulani and the Nuer offer a well-placed corrective to the "All-American" myopia of some rodeo publications. One oversight is the failure to address a distinction, which frequently appears in other studies, between cattlemen-who own land and cows but seldom work</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 71 them-and working cowboys (and cowgirls) who sustain the industry. Readers may also question the interpretation of cowboy religious beliefs, which focuses on the fundamentalist "Cowboys for Christ" phenomenon within professional rodeo; and they may be troubled by the general neglect of other studies, including those by Beverly Stoeltje and Sandra Myres, pertaining to the roles of ranch women and cowgirls in the West. Never- theless this book will command attention among students of rodeo and other American festivals for the singularity of its approach. One final observation: though very well written, Rodeo might profit from a dose of Geertzian thick description, something to enlighten readers about the emotional intensity of rodeo events the way conscientious new jour- nalists report the emotional lives of their subjects. If anything, Ms. Law- rence presents herself-and American culture in general-as more distant from rodeo than is actually the case. If rodeo bull riders take to their mounts to conquer and share the bull's potency, then so do many urban cowboys on mechanical bulls. And the exclusion of women from many aspects of rodeo certainly persists in other arenas, including academic ones. Finally, in the worldwide media dissemination of rodeo one might also see the potential multivocality of its symbolism, stretching far beyond the confines of Western ranching. JAMES C.
