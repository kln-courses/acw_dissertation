<plain_text><page sequence="1">African Terra Cottas South of the Sahara AFRICAN TERRA COTTAS SOUTH OF THE SAHARA The Detroit Institute of Arts November 22, 1972-January 31, 1973 When African Terra Cottas South of the Sahara opened at the Detroit Institute of Arts on November 22, 1972, the public was initiated into a whole new dimension of African art and culture: terra cotta. Un- til recently, the attention of both scholar and collector of African art has, with few exceptions, focused on wood, ivory, and metal. Work in clay was relegated at best to the realm of decorative art, material culture, or archeological artifact, and ar- tistic creativity in terra cotta appeared to be circumscribed by the Noke-Ife tradi- tion made familiar by the studies of Wil- liam and Bernard Fagg and Frank Willett. This exhibition of African terra cottas brings into focus for the first time the di- verse and prolific nature and extent of this medium. The exhibition verges on the spectacular in both quantity and quality. Indeed, the realization that the more than 360 pieces represent only a sampling from a limited geographic range is over- whelming; one is left wondering how much lies beyond. The exhibition was made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and by support from the Ford Ex- hibition Fund of the Founders Society of the Detroit Institute of Arts. But only the Herculean efforts of the Director, Willis F. Woods, Professor Dan Mato of Wayne State University, curator, and Professor Roy Sieber of the University of Indiana, advisor, made its realization possible. They, in turn, insist on crediting the gen- erosity of the numerous lenders, many anonymous, for its success. The operational hazards involved in mounting such an exhibition offer at least a partial explanation for the historical neglect of this area of African arts. To search out, document, and bring together pieces of the greatest fragility, not only from across the United States but from European and African collections, is an undertaking of almost unimaginable pro- portions. In contrast to objects in wood, metal, cloth, or leather, the transportation of minimally-fired clay engenders the greatest danger of breakage and literally of disintegration. These same difficulties in packing and shipping unquestionably account for the limited terra cotta hold- ings in both private and museum collec- tions. Even in those instances where vi- able collections do exist, owners were reluctant to lend their most valuable ex- CEREMONIAL VASE (WATER CONTAINER) BAMBARA, MALI.

In addition to the logistics of gathering the materials for such an extensive presen- tation, those responsible for its realization faced other problems, among which one could cite the general lack of information as well as the absence of scholarship on the subject, and the spirited but meager efforts in archeological research. Despite the studies of a number of European, American, and African researchers, some dating back to the first decades of this century, many of the archeological finds have been the result of casual accident rather than deliberate, methodological ex- cavation. Another problem which it was neces- sary to come to grips with was that of the viewing audience to which the exhibit should address itself. Was the exhibit to be oriented towards the layman in a city whose population is strongly conscious of its Black heritage, or was it to be designed as a connoisseur's feast? More concretely perhaps, the necessary decision involved reaching a balance between quantity and quality. It is a credit to the exhibition that it managed to cater to both by the ingen- ious spatial arrangement of materials. The more spectacular and better-known terra cottas such as several of the Akan funerary heads and urns, the pair of heads from the Sao culture in the Chad region, the head fragment from Ife, and several pipe bowls from Bamum in Cameroon were exhibited discretely, each in its own case. By selec- tively focusing on these well-recognized examples, it was possible to establish a contrastive balance with the larger group- 66</page><page sequence="2">ings of related materials and achieve a quantitative impact. A related problem, perhaps one more crucial to future scholarship, was the es- tablishment of a system of classification for grouping the terra cottas. Traditional typologies, based on artistic geography and ethnic continuities, were inadequate for an exhibition whose subject matter spanned a temporal as well as a spatial di- mension. The problem was resolved, at least temporarily, by establishing the fol- lowing categories: Archeological, Clas- sical, Funerary, Traditional, and Contem- porary. Into the Archeological category were grouped the terra cottas of the Djenne- Mopti region of Mali, and a small group from the archeological excavations in Chad. Since some of the difficulties which confronted the exhibition as a whole can be pointed out by the group assigned a Djenne provenance, a brief attention to this particular cluster seems in order. Although there are at least three known sites which pre-date Djenne in its immedi- ate environs, there has been to date no systematic archeological investigation of them, of their environs, or of the city of Djenne itself. The superb terra cotta of a kneeling woman, familiar to many as the frontispiece illustration in Leiris and De- lange's African Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 1968), was a surface find at Ka- nafa, one of the three pre-Djenne sites. It is presumably on the basis of stylistic affin- ity to this piece, and subject matter, that a number of the pieces in the Arche- ological category were assigned a Djenne provenance: pieces "which may date to the 14th century (and) were accidentally found by farmers in Mali." It has also been gener- ally assumed in the past that in those areas which have been heavily Islamized, an- thropomorphic representation has tended to disappear. Hence, when figural sculp- ture was found in Islamized areas, it was as- sumed to pre-date Islam. It was also as- sumed until quite recently that Islam was introduced into the Western Sudan in the late 14th century. Neither of these assump- tions is valid. It has been well established that there was an active trans-Saharan trade between Islamized North Africa and the Western Sudan as early as the 9th cen- tury A.D., even though the Tarikh es-Sou- dan suggests that Djenne did not become a Muslim city until the end of the 12th cen- tury. Furthermore, anyone familiar with the nature of African Islam will recognize and acknowledge the existence of tradi- tional, indigenous cultural patterns side by side with subsequently introduced Muslim prescriptions. There is, therefore, pres- ently no basis on which to establish any datings or a provenance for these so-called Djenne and Mopti terra cottas. The nature of the terrain in the inland Niger delta (in which both Djenne and Mopti are located) also raises a number of difficulties for arch- eological research. The annual in- nundation of the delta brings with it a de- posit of alluvial soils which disturb and realign the lower strata, making stratigra- phic analysis difficult and somewhat unre- liable. The city of Djenne, like so many set- tlement sites in west Africa, has been under continuous reconstruction for centuries, so that there is no such thing as an undis- turbed tumulus. Thus, any attempt to as- sign a date or provenance to materials from the inland Niger delta is fraught with un- certainty. Only a controlled archeological investigation in the area may ultimately re- veal the nature and extent of terra cotta art history in the area. The Nok, Ife, and Benin terra cottas, grouped under the Classical heading, rest of course on a much sounder scholastic foundation. Perhaps it was for precisely that reason that they were characterized as Classical. Although few in number by comparison with the total entourage of the collection, each of the examples is of superb quality. Particularly outstanding is the head fragment from Ife, loaned by the Guennol Collection. In the style of an idealized naturalism, it shows a striking affinity to those from Ita Yemoo recorded and discussed by Frank Willet (Ife in the History of West African Sculpture, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1967) with the addition, however, of a striated surface closely following the facial contours. The Funerary terra cottas, undoubtedly the most complete collection ever to be placed on exhibit, are drawn almost ex- clusively from the Akan tradition. The most convincing argument for the per- sistence of a singular tradition in geogra- phic breadth and temporal depth is graph- ically illustrated by the presentation of such a large sampling. The Akan terra cot- tas, like the Ife and Benin pieces, also il- lustrate clearly one of the underlying qualities of African art generally: the con- tinuity of stylistic attributes in all the art ... ............................ .. . .. .- .................. - ? : t - : :.:::-...:iI4 67</page><page sequence="3">This is a picture of a Lion.

PHOTO BY KIM HERTER forms of a given cultural matrix, whether it be music, dance, visual arts, or archi- tecture. The major part of the exhibition con- sists of examples grouped into the Tradi- tional category. Within that category the pieces are arranged by geographic and/or political region, and within each region by those ethnic groups which inhabit it. The subject matter of the terra cottas is of the greatest diversity, but the underlying characteristic of all the pieces is the unity between sculptural and functional attri- butes. The integration of what in the Western world has always been segrega- ted makes categorization in this instance well-nigh impossible. Ceremonial vessels, pipe bowls, effigy jugs and lamps from west, central, and east Africa, from Eth- iopia to South Africa, leave the viewer breathless with the overwhelming rich- ness and diversity of the terra cotta me- dium. The smallest and last of the categories is the Contemporary. It is regrettable that this last category is perhaps the least im- pressive from the point of view of work- manship and artistry. Its weaker appear- ance tempts one to ask what is meant by contemporary,' since many of the exam- ples exhibited as 'traditional' are certainly of contemporary creation. Although it is common knowledge that the pottery tra- dition in Africa remains viable, the par- ticular selection used to illustrate contem- porary artistic productivity leaves the opposite impression. The ordering of the collection might be questioned theoretically and methodologi- cally, since the categories address them- selves to functionally different measures and foci. This shortcoming manifests itself in the additional need which the exhib- itors felt to classify the contents into func- tional categories such as Royal, Ritual, Household, Personal Object, and Market- place. However, questioning the theo- retical basis of the ordering of the mate- rials does not vitiate the exhibition's success in providing continuity and order to an almost infinite range of subject mat- ter whose only common denominator is the material of creation. Alternatively, the absence of a more tightly structured clas- sification system might equally well be in- terpreted as the more accurate expression of the multi-functional, multi-vocal nature of all the African arts. The presentation of so many works of art in a single medium also intensifies the interest and curiosity about the potters and sculptors who were responsible for their creation. Regrettably, only the most cursory mention is made of the artists. True, little is known of their social posi- tion or the status attached to their works, but certainly studies such as those of Rob- ert Farris Thompson suggest that the process of creativity is enveloped with a sacred quality which extends to the sculp- tor herself. There is an interesting parallel with the mason. Like much of the hous- ing, terra cotta is also a product of the Earth. Just as the mason is often held in awe and is considered to be endowed with special magical powers, so presumably is the potter, wife of the blacksmith whose skill is also validated by supernatural en- dowment and caste membership. All three skills have a common denominator: all in- volve tampering with the Earth, which for many peoples of Africa is held to be sa- cred. Such being the case, each piece of pottery or earthen sculpture carries within itself the quality of sacrality. Much of the 'decoration' found on functional utensils might be interpreted as a sym- bolism or iconography connoting that quality and conveying it to user and viewer alike. In the eyes of both creator and user, the clay utensil without such rendering is non-functional, although to an uninitiated outsider the shape of the utensil is perfectly structured 'function- ally' for its intended use. An analogy can be made with the earthen granary, which is in itself a first cousin to coil pottery. Un- less the completed granary has been in- vested with aesthetic meaning and brought to life, so to speak, through liba- tions and sacrifices and in many instances anthropomorphic representation, it will not function successfully as a storage con- tainer in the eyes of its creators. In the face of such a magnificent exhibi- tion one hesitates to voice several minimal regrets. The continuity which was at- tempted seems, to this reviewer, to have fallen short of success, but the fault per- haps lay in the dictates of the available space. Viewers moving through the main gallery of the exhibition were propelled directly into the permanent African col- lection, rather than being led into the two adjacent wings which housed some of the most interesting pieces from east and southern Africa. Secondly, the catalogue of the exhibition, originally planned to ac- company the opening of the show, is still in the press and currently unavailable. Its contents, however, promise to more than compensate for the inconvenience of its delayed appearance. Hopefully, some of the questions posed by the exhibition will be answered by the catalogue ... and that, perhaps, is as it should be. Despite the overwhelming difficulties involved in the mounting of such an exhi- bition, there is no question that its realiza- tion is not only a major and unique achievement, but a testimony to the wealth of Africa yet to be explored. African Terra Cottas South of the Sahara reit- erates and emphasizes the need for accel- erated research, research which might ulti- mately reveal in greater detail the histori- cal and spatial relationships which link all the arts of Africa together into a compre- hensive and meaningful framework within a universal matrix of Man.
