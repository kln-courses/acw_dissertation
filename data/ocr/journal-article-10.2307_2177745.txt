Gbttingen, Vanden- hoeck und Ruprecht, I905. -pp. Vii, 20I. To understand is to interpret in terms of our own experience. Our ex- perience is primarily of a self willing, i. e., of a substance causing; there- fore to understand the world is to interpret it as ' efficacious substances' and ' inevitable processes' (p. I). From this psychological starting-point, Dr. Schultz develops the basal concepts of science, assigns their philosoph- ical status, and finally offers a physical system which should unify the field of science under the substance-cause schema more completely than has yet been done. The discussion is erudite and subtle, the style is epigram- matic, the author's constructive power is unusual, and many of his analyses (e. g., of action at a distance, of motor sensations, of energetics) are strikingly original. We do not think he has succeeded in developing all his main concepts out of his starting point, but his results must certainly be heeded by all who work in the field of Na/urj5hilosoj5hie.</page><page sequence="2">2I8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XV. Understanding is anthropomorphizing, necessary because acquired through ages of inheritance ; it is more than economical description, because we feel that when our will moves our limbs we know not only the how but also the why. We get here no ontological predicates; neither are there active substances in the world nor is the self an active substance. We have rather a command, ' See things thus if you will conceive them' (p. 9). But the anthropomorphism must be consistent. Scientists may accept con- flicting hypotheses for different sets of facts, but this will not do for a phil- osophical account of science (p. I 3). Kant, who taught us the necessity of this anthropomorphism, taught also that its detailed application is determined by the nature of the given. So we find that, when we have alternative modes open to us of formulating the substance-cause schema, experience decides which one we adopt. Thus we can formulate events dynamically or kinetically. Either causes reside in the substances themselves, or they lie in the changes of substances (mo- tions). The former view, dynamism, allows force to reside in a body and to act irrespective of where the body is, and thus permits action at a dis- tance. The latter, kinetism, does not. Before the choice is made, further concepts are developed in Section 2. (i) Quantity (extensive) is used for simplicity's sake. Qualitative differ- ences leave us in the complex and are as explanations ' occult' (verborgen). We submit that this concept has not its origin in our experiences of self- willing, but is derived from external observations; it is not anthropomor- phic. (2) All change must be reduced to motion, the only mode of inner experience suited to anthropomorphism; we do not experience how it feels to be red or fragrant, but we do know how it feels to move and how a sub- stance can cause motion (p. 20). (3) Matter is a projection of the category of substance. (4) Action at a distance is a good consistent category. The axiom which supposedly contradicts it, that a body cannot act where it is not, does not tell us the meaning of ' where it is.' A body is where it exerts repulsion. Of course it cannot attract where it repels. But the axiom does not show that it may not attract where it does not repel, i. e., at a dis- tance (p. 30). We subscribe to this; but, again, this is no anthropomor- phism, for we do not ourselves attract bodies to us. It is a matter of ex- ternal observation. (5) Forces of attraction must act in a straight line; otherwise their direction is indeterminate. Here, too, we agree, but must deny the anthropormophism. We do not feel ourselves to move in straight lines, but external perception furnishes them (though as illusions). Once for all, we must say that the anthropomorphic starting-point is infertile. The subjectivity of the scientific categories does not enable us to under- stand all their variety of meaning. Another antinomy now appears. Is rest natural and motion alone to be explained, or is uniform motion natural and change of motion to be explained ? Not self-feeling, but experience, shows that the latter permits a far simpler explanation of actual motions (p. 25). The views of dynam-</page><page sequence="3">No. 2.] NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. 219 ism and kinetism are then developed. Since to the latter mass and elas- ticity remain ' occult' qualities (p. 45), the former seems, on experiential grounds, the better view. The next antinomy (Sec. 3) is between atomism and plerotism (continuism). Combining these with dynamism and kinet- ism, four alternative views appear. Dynamic plerotism does not explain the distinction of substances; kinetic atomism is inconsistent, since atom- ism must be dynamic (p. 53). The main objection to dynamic atomism rests on the dubiousness of action at a distance. Section 4 examines five possible ways of accounting for this by contact-action, and finds them untenable. As action at a distance is in itself tenable and dynamism is preferable to kinetism, we are driven to a dynamic atomism. Section 5 on " Chimaeras " disposes of all theories which assert bunches in a continuum (Klosssuj5gentheorien, p. 93). Section 6 condemns Energetics. It either banishes substance and cause, - a psychological impossibility, if we are to understand anything, - or, keeping them, fails to explain their changes as atomism does. Moreover, since energy moves, it is not so different from matter after all. The last two sections (Sec. 7 on Matter and Sec. 8 on the Ether) sketch the author's system of dynamic atomism, his Naturh ilosojh5e. Natur- fihilosojihie is a link between science and epistemology. The last states the demands to which all science must conform; it contains commands but no assertions. These have already been set forth. Science makes assertions, e. g., the atoms of chemistry exist - alas, that they are too small to be verified by sight (p. I23, I47, I48) ! Naturjhsilosoj5hie shows under what hypotheses the facts asserted by science may be construed so as to conform to the demands, e. g., the hypothesis of dynamic atomism. The atoms of this system do not exist, but are postulates or possibilities (P. I23). We have not space to outline the system; suffice it to say that it posits an atomic ether (p. I49) whose atoms are close to one another, agglomerations of which, in the form of hollow spheres, are our chemical atoms. These are practically indestructible on account of great surface- tension (p. I26). Gravitation is ultimate; affinity is a function of size and shape of the atoms (p. I28) and electrons are constituted by thinning or thickening of clouds of ether-atoms about a chemical atom (p. I57). A clear summary and a thorough and useful bibliography complete the book. W. H.
