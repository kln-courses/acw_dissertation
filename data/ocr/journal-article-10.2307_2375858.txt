<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF ETHICS. JANUARY, i908. THE MORAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIVE RACES IN SOUTH AFRICA. I. "The strength and vitality of a race, and its power of holding its own in the world," says Mr. Bryce in his "Im- pressions of South Africa," "depend less on the quickness of its intelligence than on the solidity of its character.... Its character depends upon the moral ideas which govern its life, and on the habits in which those ideas take shape; and these, in their turn, depend very largely upon the conceptions which the race has formed of religion, and on the influence that religion has over it. This is especially true of peoples in the earlier stages of civilization. Their social virtues, the beliefs and principles which hold them together and influence their conduct, rest upon and are shaped by their beliefs re- garding the invisible world and its forces. Races in which religious ideas are vague and feeble seldom attain to a vigor- ous national life, because they want one of the most effective bonds of cohesion and some of the strongest motives that rule conduct." Whether these remarks of Mr. Bryce need qualifying by ethnological and anthropological considerations I must leave to others to determine. The ethnologists and the anthropologists would probably say that when a race be- comes deficient in vitality no beliefs or principles will save it from extinction. But to this Mr. Bryce would retort that its be- liefs and principles, its solidity or its want of solidity of char- acter would be a part of, or the outcome of, its vitality as a Vol. XVIII.-No. 2.

In all questions of race, as in our individual life, there is an unknown something which defies analysis, and our necessary ignorance of which readily lends itself to vague generalities and vicious reasoning. On the other hand, an enthusiastic Christian missionary, on reading Mr. Bryce's words, would naturally exclaim: "Yes, let us give to the lower races our Christian beliefs and principles, and they will soon attain to a vigorous national life." But the problem is not so simple. Mr. Bryce himself would admit that the "beliefs regarding the invisible world and its forces," the beliefs which influence conduct, are the great world-beliefs in God, the destiny of the soul, and the daily requirements which will enable the soul to fulfil its destiny. But these beliefs are not by any means confined to Christianity. It is doubtful whether-for all men-they find their highest expression in Christianity. For us Christians, yes. But for Hindus, Japanese, Chinese, it is doubtful. God fulfils himself in many ways. It would be interesting to know what the moral effect upon the South African native races would have been had Buddhism or Confucianism estab- lished itself in South Africa instead of Christianity. Would the moral effect have been better or worse than under Chris- tianity? This question would, of course, be answered in dif- ferent ways by different people, but it is well to bear in mind that there is as great a difference, in essentials, between the beliefs of some of the missionary agencies in South Africa- say between Roman Catholicism and Wesleyanism-as there is between Wesleyanism and a high type of Buddhism or Zoroastrianism. Another factor to be borne in mind in estimating the effect of beliefs on morality, and especially on the morality of a primitive race, is this: that the primitive man cannot possibly hold a belief in the same sense in which we hold it. The great words, God, Christ, soul, sin, heaven, come to his mind with a totally different meaning from that which they bear to us, a meaning wrought out of very rich and full, or out of very poor and meagre, experiences. The primitive man simply translates these -and other great words into his</page><page sequence="3">The M1oral Development of Races in South Africa. I39 own moral and spiritual vocabulary, with sometimes astonish- ing results. To give only one instance out of many, Mr. Dudley Kidd, in his book, "The Essential Kaffir," tells a story of a lady, a missionary teacher, who was trying to teach an old Kaffir the elements of New Testament Christianity. She ultimately came to the subject of angels and "spent a good half-hour trying to knock into the head of the old fellow, who was, however, very dull, some idea as to the nature of angels. At length, after endlessly dinning the same facts into his head, she said, 'And what are angels?' The old man looked very serious, and said very slowly, with a pause be- tween his words, 'Angels-are-birds.' And on another occasion, after listening to a long dissertation on sin, which was likened to the weeds in the garden, he was asked what sins were, and he said, in the same deliberate way, 'Sins- are-weeds-in-the-garden.'" He was not far wrong in the material counterpart of the conceptions, but how dim must have been his comprehension of the moral and spiritual significance of the words! Many tribes have a dim and vague conception of an after-life, but few, if any, have any idea of eternal duration, hence, discourses on the immortality of the soul would convey little meaning to their minds. Their beliefs about God are essentially, and sometimes grotesquely, anthropomorphic. I am not urging these considerations with the object of disparaging missionary endeavor or of throwing cold water on the Christianizing of the native races. I believe the native races ought to be Christianized. But I wish to caution the reader against expecting too much from a mere surface change in theological beliefs, and against interpreting the word "be- lief" in too narrow a sense, i. e., the sense in which he may happen to hold, it. A proper attitude of mind on this matter will have far-reaching effects on both missionary enterprise and national policy. It will tend to confine missionary en- terprise to, or concentrate it upon, those peoples over whom we have assumed certain governmental responsibilities, as in South Africa. And it will tend to moderate, or make more cautious, missionary enterprise amongst those people over</page><page sequence="4">I40 International Journal of Ethics. whom we have no governmental responsibilities. It may, indeed, lead European governments to disavow all respon- sibility for such enterprise. For there is no doubt that much harm has been done by intemperate and ill-advised missionary agencies. In i9oi the leading Buddhists of Japan issued an address to all the churches of the Western world, an address in which they condemned, in strong but dignified terms, the unwisdom of Christian missionaries and missionary societies as having been the main cause of the Boxer outbreak, and some of the missionaries themselves admit that it has been a contributory cause. "Our object is simply to make it clear," says Dr. A. H. Smith, a distinguished American missionary, in his "Convulsions in China," "that we recognize the present attitude of the Christian Church, Protestant and Catholic alike, as a great bar to the spread of the gospel in China, and perhaps the most potent single cause of Chinese hos- tility;" though he qualifies this by saying later on, that "for the precipitation of the tremendous crisis which has occurred the proportion of responsibility of Protestant missions-is un- doubtedly real, but it is a small and relatively insignificant factor." Perhaps I might make the suggestion here that with regard to missionary work amongst peoples over whom we have no governmental control, it would be wise to organize periodical international conferences between the religious leaders of the various races, from San Francisco to Pekin, with a view to the formulation of an amicable policy based on mutual toleration, purely voluntary endeavor, and respect for the law and religious customs of each country. There are two pernicious and widely prevalent notions against which it is necessary to be on our guard: first, the notion that the color of a man's skin determines his superiority or inferiority in the scale of civilization, a notion which may lead to a modified form of slavery, as with alien indentured labor, and which I may call the superstition of the color line; sec- ond, the notion that because a man's religion, or rather theology, may be good for him and his race, it is therefore good for all men and all races, a notion which may lead to the fanaticism of racial and religious wars, and which I may</page><page sequence="5">The Moral Development of Races in South Africa. 14I term the superstition of the tribal god-two superstitions to which we English people, or perhaps I should say European peoples, are peculiarly prone. II. In order to bring this question of the elevation of native races through moral and religious endeavor more vividly be- fore the mind of the reader, I append a table, which I have compiled from the latest census returns for Cape Colony, showing the number of adherents of the various religious denominations, both of European and native descent. The figures refer to Cape Colony only, not to the whole of South Africa: Mixed or European. Native. Colored. Dutch Reformed Church .296,792 3I,254 7I,266 Church of England.

This table requires a little explanation, and care must be taken not to read into it more than the figures will bear. The "mixed or colored" population is composed of people of mixed European and native blood, and the offspring of these mixed European and native races are more readily adaptable to civilized customs and beliefs than are the offspring of purely native races. Again, the large proportion of natives and colored to whites in the Rhenish and Moravian bodies is explained by the fact that these are purely missionary agencies almost wholly supported from Europe. The other religious bodies, also, are very largely supported from Europe in their missionary work. It is but fair to the Dutch Re- formed Church to say that the whole, or nearly the whole, of its missionary funds are raised in South Africa, a fact which probably accounts for its smaller field of missionary activity in comparison with the number of its members of European descent. I believe it raises more money, in South Africa, for missionary work than any other church. But the most striking facts about this table are the almost total failure, in this field, of the Salvation Army, whose methods, one would have thought, would have appealed to the natives' love of sensation; and the comparative weak- ness of the Roman Catholic Church amongst the natives. On the other hand, may be noticed the great strength of Wesleyan- ism. Obviously, the natives take to Wesleyanism, while Episcopalianism, notwithstanding its wealth and imperial prestige, compares unfavorably, in proportion to the number of European adherents, with the leading Protestant sects. But the most noteworthy fact is one which does not ap- pear in the table, namely, that probably not three per cent. of the native or colored converts know anything of the doc- trinal or ecclesiastical differences which separate Episcopalian- ism from Wesleyanism, or Wesleyanism from Congregation- alism. The success and spread of any particular form of Christianity depends largely on the amount of money any par- ticular missionary agency can devote to the work and the number of workers it can put in the field. Had as much money been available for Unitarian missionary work as for</page><page sequence="7">The Moral Development of Races in South Africa. 143 Episcopalian or Wesleyan, there is no doubt that a large num- ber of natives would have become so-called Unitarians. The point I wish to enforce is this, that in the moral and reli- gious development of native races, sectarian and ecclesias- tical doctrines count for little our nothing, at least, in the early stages. It is the cardinal and fundamental beliefs that tell-God, Christ, the soul, immortality. What would be the ultimate effect on native character of an Episcopalian, as distinct from an evangelical, or a rationalistic type of reli- gion, it is, of course, impossible at present to say. We are thrown back, then, on fundamental beliefs. Nay, we are thrown back on something deeper than fundamental beliefs-on the modes of life in which beliefs find their efficacy and their justification. Here we are brought to the great question of education, and what education means. Every well-wisher of the native races in South Africa must surely be gratified at the emphatic way in which the recent Commis- sion on Native Affairs has dispelled the widespread delusion that education and Christianity have a demoralizing effect on the native. In the coast towns of South Africa this no- tion is passed from mouth to mouth with a parrot-like repeti- tion which becomes wearisome. The very words in which it is expressed-"Oh! the educated 'nigger' is no good"-shows the bias of those who hold it. Its prevalence may be accounted for in this way: the employer of labor requires natives in his business, that is, for the purpose of making profit, nearly all the unskilled labor in South Africa being done by natives or colored people. For unskilled work the uneducated native is sometimes more useful to the employer than the educated native, because, being uneducated, he is a more subservient "tool" with no nonsense about his "rights." This is the point of view from which the average employer judges. The edu- cated native is not so subservient a tool, he has more self- respect, he considers himself to be a human being, perhaps even a citizen, and in this process of moral and civic development he is apt to show a certain amount of "cheekiness." Hence, from the purely profit-making point of view he is "no good"! But he gets employment for all that, which shows that he</page><page sequence="8">I44 International Journal of Ethics. is some good after all, and, indeed, one wonders what South Africa would do without him. At any rate the commission has reported very emphatically and unanimously on this point, as may be seen from the following extract: "The consensus of opinion expressed before the commission is to the effect that education, while in a certain number of cases it has had the effect of creating in the natives an aggressive spirit, arising no doubt from an exaggerated sense of individual self-importance, which renders them less docile and less disposed to be contented with the position for which nature or circumstances have fitted them, has had generally a beneficial influence on the natives themselves, and by raising the level of their intelligence, and by increasing their capacity as workers and their earning power, has been an advantage to the community. "Testimony has been given as to the value of education as a concomi- tant of religious and moral instruction, and as to its economic effect in raising the standard of material comfort and thus creating wants. Apart from the consideration that there is a moral obligation upon the State to provide for the intellectual development of all classes of its subjects, there appear to be very sound reasons of policy for the adop- tion of a liberal and sympathetic attitude toward the subject of native education. The native, in common with the rest of mankind, does not live by bread alone, and possesses certain mental impulses and aspira- tions which demand satisfaction. . . . No policy can be complete or sound which is limited to political or economical considerations only, and which takes no account of the irrepressible forces within each individual. And it is evident that there is among the people themselves a growing desire for education, which cannot and need not be suppressed." In qualification of this, and as some justification of the popular view, I may say that the education hitherto given to the native has been, on the whole, of too bookish or intellectual a character. It has been the modern board or common school system drilled into the mind of a race which has been taken away from the structure of its own tribal life and morality, and brought into contact with the artificiality, sensationalism, and vice of town life and civilization. It has neglected native apti- tudes, and the formation of character in the deepest sense of that word; or rather, it has sought to reform it by a thin smat- tering of theological or denominational instruction. What we want in South Africa is an independent inquiry, apart from either missionary or capitalist ideals, as to the meaning and con- tent of "education," in so far as it should strive to fit the native to be both an end in himself as a responsible human</page><page sequence="9">The Moral Development of Races in South Africa. I45 being, and an efficient means to the welfare of the community to which he belongs. The commission also commends the enlightened policy of Cape Colony in the matter of native education, as compared with the other South African States, the expenditure per native scholar being as follows: Cape Colony, I5s. 9d.; 1 Natal, I4s. 4d.; Transvaal, 8s. 7d.; Orange River Colony, 5s. 6d.; Rhodesia, 9s. 3d.; Basutoland, 13s. 5d. The num- ber of native and colored children in the schools in Cape Colony is 95,306, while the number of native school chil- dren in the other colonies is, Natal, IO,I54; Transvaal, I1,683; Orange River Colony, 6,500; Rhodesia, 334; Basutoland, io,484. The percentage of native scholars to native population is as follows: Cape Colony (native and colored), 5.20; Natal, I.12; Transvaal, 1.13; Orange River Colony, 2.76; Rhodesia, .o5; Basutoland, 3.OI.2 But let us go back for a moment to the question of the relation of education to belief, and of belief to modes of life. On this question a great change in missionary opinion has undoubtedly taken place during the last twenty-five or thirty years. It is now more generally admitted that habits, work, industry, settled modes of life, and moral training, are quite as necessary as the inculcation of theological beliefs and elementary intellectual instruction, in order to influence char- acter permanently and for good. The reason is obvious. Habits of industry help to develop the moral side of personality by training in method, accuracy, patience, perseverance, the adaptation of means to -ends, and above all, by strengthening and disciplining the will, that is, in self-control and all that 1 This is but approximate, however, as detailed and separate figures respecting government grants to native and colored schools, as distinct from European, are not available. 'For the purpose of comparison, I may say that the percentage of European scholars to the total European population in Cape Colony at the present time is about I2 per cent. The proportion of school children to total population in England and Wales is, I believe, about I7'2 per cent., but education is not yet compulsory in Cape Colony, and it is the custom here for parents to send their children to school somewhat later than in England, on account of the warmer climate of South Africa.</page><page sequence="10">i46 International Journal of Ethics. makes a man. We are all-and this is especially true of undeveloped natives-we are all too ready to follow our momentary feelings, impulses, and desires. The man of weak will is often submerged by these; he easily gives way to' temptation, and is led, by sheer want of self-control, into the devious ways of vice. Now industry, and especially hand- work, does undoubtedly strengthen the will by the sustained effort that it requires, and also, by training the mind to think connectedly, helps it to bring together and to follow a complex train of means in pursuance of a definite end. That is self-con- trol. A child who makes a box not only learns how to make a box, it also gets lessons in accuracy, patience, perseverance, industry, and the adaptation of means to ends. These are the qualities that form character. These are the lessons that help to make citizens. Not only this. The inculcation of beliefs requires the use of abstract terms which the immature mind cannot fully understand. Even moral terms, right and wrong, good and bad, accuracy and inaccuracy, false and true, are abstractions which to many minds have not a very definite meaning save when applied to actual concrete instances. Now industry, the work in hand, furnishes 'the concrete instance. By passing through those nerve-centers which affect both thoughts and habits it so stamps its influence on the mind and life that that influence becomes ineffaceable. It becomes part of the life and character, and the individual is false or true, good or bad, in proportion as his work is false or true, good or bad. "By their fruits ye shall know them." Now to dump down into the immature mind of the native the intellectual results of our thousand years of civilization, without train- ing him in those moral habits which work and experience alone can grave upon his character, would be to commit a very serious mistake. The native must be scientifically trained in those habits of industry (not, I need hardly say, by the serf method of "forced labor") which produce self- respect, and which will make him a better, a more intelligent, and a more efficient member of society. In this direction nothing has yet been done in South Africa</page><page sequence="11">The Moral Development of Races in South Africa. 147 on the scale of Mr. Booker T. Washington's splendid train- ing institute at Tuskegee. But something has been done. There are now thirteen small training institutes in various parts of the colony and native territories at which over eleven hundred native youths and girls are trained either as pupil teachers or for the various industries. These institutes are managed mainly by the churches or the missionary societies, and assisted by government grants. One, however, is man- aged by the natives themselves, with the assistance of Ameri- can negroes, on Tuskegee lines. The boy apprentices serve for four or five years at carpentry, shoemaking, printing, masonry, etc., in the industrial departments, studying for the standard examinations at the same time. The girls are taught house and laundry work, sewing and cookery. The fees are very low, in some cases amounting only to 5s. per week, in- cluding board. Day scholars in the standards are in some cases admitted free, in others on payment of is. a quarter.3 There are about eighty Europeans engaged in the institute, among them being graduates of English and Scotch uni- versities, and trained teachers from the training colleges of Great Britain. The examination lists are scanned as eagerly by educated natives as by Europeans. What, then, should be done? It is obvious that with some I33,o00 native and colored children receiving elementary edu- cation in the schools, but with little provision for industrial training, the great question is, not, Shall the native be edu- cated? but, How shall he be so educated as to enable him to use his energies both for his own well-being and moral progress, and for the welfare of the State? The missionary societies and churches are obviously unable to cope with the problem. So great is the demand for higher education amongst the natives themselves, and so inadequate are the means for supplying it, that many are going to America and Europe for their education. The churches and missionary societies are inadequate to the work. They are often too conservative. 'For some of these facts I am indebted to an interesting paper read at a recent Teachers' Conference by the Rev. D. D. Stormont (Blyths- wood).</page><page sequence="12">I48 Internatfonal Journal of Ethics. They cannot meet the necessary financial outlay. Nor is it right that they should be asked to meet it. It is a matter for the State. This, then, should be done. The State should impose a special educational tax on natives, the proceeds of which should be devoted exclusively to native elementary, industrial, and higher education, and particularly to the establishment of industrial institutes. The organization and management of the schools and institutes should be placed in the hands of representative boards, to which the mission schools and institutes might be transferred. It is said by those who *are supposed to know that many of the churches would willingly transfer this work to the State in order that they might de- vote their funds and energies to other necessary work.4 But the Commission on Native Affairs expresses itself more cau- tiously. On this question of State education, its report is somewhat disappointing. It declares itself against any sys- tem "of general public undenominational education independ- ent of existing missionary organizations," but it adds, some- what inconsequently, that "it is advisable in the opinion of the majority of the commission to extend to some form of industrial training the same general support that is accorded to elementary education;" and it goes on to say that "the resources of these mission churches are limited as to men and means, and there are parts which their organizations have not reached, and in which there may be, and in places is, a local desire among the natives for means of education. With reference to such neighborhoods and elsewhere, it is neces- sary to consider and decide upon the question whether native schools established, or to be established, in full compliance with the regulation of government and under its supervision, but without European missionary control, should be recog- nized and aided or not. The commission, while admitting that there is much opposition to the view, holds that recogni- tion and aid should be given." It is therefore "of opinion 'This is the opinion of the Rev. D. D. Stormont (Blythswood) given in the paper already alluded to.</page><page sequence="13">The Moral Development of Races in South Africa. i49 that any local demand for native education not otherwise pro- vided for should be met by the creation of a fund, to be ad- ministered or not, as circumstances permit, by a local board or committee and to be raised by means of a rate levied upon the natives in the area concerned." This would obviously mean a dual system of mission and State schools, which is hardly necessary, as the native, as I have shown, is influenced by the cardinal and fundamental beliefs of Christianity rather than by its denominational or doctrinal varieties. The principle of an education rate or tax is conceded, but it might be made general instead of being confined to particular areas;" the work of education should be pushed into districts where, at present, the native is entirely outside the pale of education; and industrial or training institutes should be established to which all native students who would pay the moderate fees imposed should be admitted. The cry is often raised amongst Europeans in South Africa: "Tax the natives." So say I, but let this special native education tax be used exclusively for the bene- fit of the natives and administered by native representatives, in cooperation, of course, with advisers of European descent. I lay stress upon the advisability of inducing the native to pay more largely toward his own education, that is, through the State, or partially through the State. He is well able to do so. It is unfair to tax a comparatively small white minority for this, except to the extent of a fair proportion of the gen- eral revenue and such government grants as may be deemed advisable. Above all, the native would value his edu- cation all the more. He would feel that he himself, through his own industry, must work out his own moral and intellec- tual salvation. The process may be slow, but it will be more effective than any undue forcing system for which the energy has to be "stoked up" from outside. Neither must we expect too much under the best conditions. If it is true that nature never makes a leap it will take many generations for the native races to attain a fair level of civilization, just as it 'Such a tax is already imposed in some parts of the native territories.</page><page sequence="14">150 International Journal of Ethics. has taken Europeans many generations, nay centuries. But the task must be attempted. It is the only way. I have not the space to deal at length with the economic objections to the industrial and higher education of the native races. It is said that the skilled native will come into com- petition with the skilled white workers. But surely it is too late in the day to attempt to keep one race in ignorance for the convenience of another. The more skilled workers there are in a country the richer that country will become. It is too often forgotten that for a long time to come the chief industry in South Africa must be agriculture. But Europeans will not go on to the land in large numbers, they prefer the towns. In the native training institutes, then, training in agriculture and allied industries should occupy a leading place. It would be far better to have an intelligent population on the soil than an ignorant and a practically serf population. On the necessity for teaching hygiene in native and colored schools, to a race which is gradually adopting the customs of civilization with sometimes deplorable results I need not dwell. I need only say that while, in thirty-five of the chief towns of the colony, the death rate amongst Europeans is only sixteen per thousand, the death rate amongst the native and colored races is forty-six per thousand; and while, out of I,ooo children born of European parents, 159 die before they are a year old, out of I,ooo children born of native and colored parents, 328 die before they are a year old. In some places indeed the rate for colored children reaches 45o, and in one place it acually stands at 8oo. These figures speak for themselves. There are other questions of grave importance affecting the welfare of the native and mixed races. There is the ques- tion of the liquor traffic amongst the natives; there are grave questions affecting the future of the colored people, that is, the people of mixed European and native descent, about whose vitality, stability, intellectual capacity, and moral and mate- rial condition we have so little available data; and there is the important question of native franchise and representa- tion. But I have already exceeded my space. The reader</page><page sequence="15">The Moral Development of Races in South Africa. 151 will see that in the matter of education and genuine concern for the welfare of the native, the record of Cape Colony stands in sharp contrast to the brutality of some Australian and American States, and is far higher than that of other South African States. South Africa will never be wholly a white man's country; it will never be wholly a black man's country. It is therefore essential that all races should work harmoniously with each other, and our most fervent prayer may well be that they may never be brought into disastrous conflict. The rise of an intelligent native population will make for the desired end, and furnish, perhaps, a much-needed object lesson to the world. RAMSDEN BALMFORTH.
