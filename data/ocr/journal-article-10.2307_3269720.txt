<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXVI, Fasc. 2 ADORANTS IN PREHISTORIC ART Prehistoric Attitudes and Gestures of Prayer JOHANNES MARINGER Adorants are persons performing an act of adoration or invocation to a higher being. This act is always accompanied by a posture of the body or motion of the limbs to express or emphasize a desire or to enforce a request. According to Fr. Heiler, 1 there occur rather many attitudes and gestures of adorants in the historic and primitive world. They vary from standing, kneeling, sitting or squatting to prostrating, from inclining the head or bending the upper part of the body to raising one or both arms or extending them with the hands opened (above to the heavenly powers, down to the chthonic ones) or with spread fingers to uplifting the arms to or above the head, from clasping the hands, joining them to crossing above the breast, to touching an altar or idol to kissing them. Widely spread is also the cultic nudity, at least taking off the head- of foot-gear. All these attitudes and gestures represent a legacy of past times. They belong to forms of religion which have kept alive throughout centuries and even millenaries. Because of their being an old tradi- tional legacy the interpretation of their meaning and the discovery of their origin are not quite simple. At any rate, they include an ingenious symbolism: in the different attitudes and gestures there we find ex- pressed the special relation of man to a deity, further the elementary religious feeling of weakness, dependence or longing desire. Since analogous attitudes and gestures are found in social life, in greeting, doing homage and imploring other fellows, especially supe- riors, they are ambivalent. As to the prehistoric past, only art shows us these attitudes and gestures. But art is silent. The only help are the context of the picture and some knowledge of the then religion. The most ancient art is that of the Upper Palaeolithic (50/30, 000ooo- io,ooo B.C.), the so-called Ice Age Art. It developed in this far remote 1 Fr. Heiler, Das Gebet.

This genuine art was produced by hunters and was in the first line restricted to animals of the hunting realm, but there appear, however much rarer, also human beings and beings of the transcendant world. Some of their gestures have been interpreted by prehistorians as gestures of prayer. According to H. Miiller-Karpe, 2 all depends upon the question as to how far the cognition of dependence from transcendent beings and of relation to these in the original form of mystic vision and presen- timental experience were already conceptionally perceived. As to some palaeolithic statuettes and reliefs, we may eventually speak of attitudes of prayer or an act of offering, if we do not envisage too restricted concrete gestures of later religions, but remember that the fundamental element of prayer consists simply in the desire of a thoughtful com- munication with the divinity. Anyhow, we are permitted in face of palaeolithic human representations with raised arms, I dare say, to think of praying persons. Already the human figurines, used as pendants and grave goods express to prehistoric man more than a confrontation of the ego with the superhuman nature; they seem to reflect the perception of his creatural condition and the presentiment of his relation to the transcendental world. Miiller-Karpe points to C. Schuchhardt 3 who sees in the posture of some statues and statuettes with hands upon or under the breast 4 a gesture of prayer. There are other more probable examples. A. Marshack 5 refers to an engraved fragment of bone from Laugerie-Basse, Dordogne, with the image of a huge fish, two humanoids with upraised arms and a lone arm below the fish. The context points to an act of adoration according to him in a mythical one. Another engraved bone from the same site depicts hind legs and a phallus of a bull standing over a naked, pregnant woman who is lying on her back raising her hands. Some other engraved lines suggest that the woman may be standing in prayer, in worship or adoration. From the same site and level there 2 H.

These men raise their arms and are bent for- ward as in supplication. 6 From Isturitz, Basses-Pyrenees, there comes another engraved bone with two naked decorated females, apparently in prayer when the bone is held vertically. 7 Here should also be mentioned a fragment of engraved bone from Le Morin, Gironde, on which a right and left hand are engraved, one above the other, each with hand open as though in adoration or reverence. Above the hands is an unusual schematic image of multiple angles pointing down- ward that looks like rain or water. Both the hands and the angular series appear as symbolic elements throughout the European Upper Palaeolithic. Since each element in this engraving is one symbol in a larger story, Marshack 8 tentatively assumes that the angles were attributes or symbols in a myth and that the hands indicate the human participation in the myth. From the cave La Marche, Vienne, about 200 stone slabs with crudely engraved human heads and humanoids were collected, among them several humanoids with raised arms (Fig. Ib). These give, according to Fr. Bourdier, 9 the impression of adorants. The La Marche pictures differ so much from all other engraved figures of the Upper Palaeoli- thic that grave doubts in the genuiness have been expressed, but many renowned investigators stand up for their originality.

It remains to mention the pictures of hands in many caves of West Europe, especially in that of Gargas, Hautes-Pyrindes. 11 They were produced by stereotyping the color-smeared hand on the rock or pressing the hand against a color-smeared spot of the rock.

Kirch- ner. 13 As they cannot be explained but by ethnographic analogies, they are most probably gestures of offering or/and imploring made to a spirit or deity whose abode the cave was. Whereas the examples from West Europe belong to the Magdalenian (15i,ooo-lo/8,ooo B.C.), Middle and East Europe have yielded earlier ones, namely from the Aurignacian (30,000-20,000 B.C.). From the Aurignacian of Austria there comes the famous soft stone plastic of the "Venus" of Willendorf, a fat, abundant, faceless female with a crown of matronly waves or curls, with two thick arms and hands resting on an enourmous bosom. The statuette had been painted with red ochre, a symbolic color: blood, life and vitality. 14 The big hair crown and the faceless appearance give the impression of an inclined head and, together with the holding of the arms, that of an attitude of reverence or prayer. Probably, that may have been the attitude of prayer for women at that time. The Aurignacian site of Gagarino at the upper Don River, USSR, has yielded several female statuettes, carved from ivory; among these two or three show the same attitude 15 (Fig. Ie). The same holds true in case of a crude stone plastic from Kostjenki near Veronece at the Don-River 16 (Fig. If). Likewise Italy offers two examples, one of sandstone from Chiozza, Prov. Reggio Emilia, the other, carved in soapstone, from Mentone (Fig. Id), Ventimiglia; they also exhibit impressively the attitude of women absorbed in prayer. 17 In the first epiglacial period, the Mesolithic (lo/8,ooo-7/5,ooo B.C. the splendid art of the Upper palaeolithic hunters disappeared. The mesolithic hunters and fishermen practised a more schematizised, geo- metric art, mostly on pieces of bone and horn. Only the hunters of South Spain exercised a lifeful painting art on rocks. Famous is a picture frieze at Cogul, Prov. Lerida, which displays several animals, 12 A. R. Verbrugge, Le symbol de la main dans la prdhistoire, Courances 1958. 13 L.

A similar scene is depicted in a painted frieze of the Cueva Vieja, Alpera, Prov. Albacete, where two sorcerers with upraised arms and holding bow and arrows in their hands are conjuring the animals. 19 This gesture of magical conjuring is alike to that of prayer, both being founded in the same human request. Among the red-painted pebbles from Mas d'Azil, Aridge, there occurs a motive which gives the impression of a schematizised praying figure. H. Obermaier 20 has detected that this motive corresponds in a surprising manner to figures of adorants in the schematic rock-art of neolithic Spain. In both cases the figures were connected with the cult of ancestors (Fig. 2a). In the Neolithic (7/5,ooo-3/2,ooo B.C.) we meet with a great many representations of adorants painted as well as engraved on rocks on stones, on ceramic vessels and in form of statuettes. Thus the above-mentioned schematic rock art of Spain shows many figures with raised arms, to all appearance representing adorants. The sites are considered by H. Breuil 21 as cult places, above all dedicated to the cult of the ancestors. In this context the adorants have acted as intercessors for the living ones. The same ideology seems to have been connected with the idols of Almeria near Madrid. Likewise, in France there were found adorants on megalithic menhirs: menhir of Saint-Micaud, Sa6ne-et-Loire, with the figure of an adorant in front of a serpent. As to the serpent it was venerated in the mega- lithic world as a sacred animal, connected with the goddess of death and the chthonic earth. Similar figures occur in Arctic Art of Norway. The most impressing example, a scenic representation, was discovered in the Folsomhulen (cave of Folsom) at Leka, Nord-Trondelag. The painting in red shows at right a huge cross, measuring more than two meters in height and is Maringer and Bandi (n. 14 above) Fig. 63c. 19 Ibid., Fig. 148. 2o H.

We may see in the man dancers or/and adorants. They were surely performing a ceremonial act of veneration or supplication. Among the petroglyphs at Lake Onega in Karelia and on the banks of the Vyg River near Sereka on the White Sea, there are many figures of adorants with upraised arms. 23 Likewise in South Russia there occur many figures with raised arms among the petroglyphs. 24 Further there exist anthropomorphous stele figures having the hands joined in the gesture of prayer Fig. 2b. 25 The gesture of prayer with raised hands was also encountered on engraved rocks of Sibiria, and often so, according to A. P. Okla- nikov. 26 In the Near East there were adorants manifoldly depicted on wall- frescoes, on seals, on stone statues, and terracotta plates. In the Baby- lonic palace at Mari the fresco-paintings exhibit several so-called intro- duction and offering scenes; always an attendant with upraised arms assists to the ceremony. 27 Many seals show the same scene including the praying attendant, the hands raised up to the level of the breast or one hand upraised over the right shoulder, the other one resting on the breast or both hands raised in front of the breast. 28 Among the petroglyphs of Anatolia there occurs a kneeling person with a votive offering 29 (Fig. 2e). Egypt has yielded many votive adorants, sculptured in stone, mostly 22 G. Gjessing, Nordenfielske Ristninger og Malinger av den arktiske Gruppe, Oslo 1936, P1. L. 23 M.

Plentiful are the plastic figurines of the agriculturists in southeast Europe, especially in the Balkan peninsula. As J. Neustupn5j 33 states: "We must be aware that the cult of fertility comprised a whole set of equipment: figurines of worshippers, priestesses, devotees, zoomorphic figurines, vessels, etc.". Similarly S. Marinescu-Bilku 34 writes that especially in the Gumelnita culture of eastern Romania and eastern Bulgaria plastics are abundant and that there occur many ones with arms raised in different forms: stretched aside, raised in adoration or conjuration. Some of them, however, are interpreted by M. Gim- butas 35 as "Bee-Goddess or "Birth-giving Goddess." Further, we have some plastics of anthropomorphic figures from Moravia, Czechoslowakia, which in all probability represent adorants. Thus a female figurine in clay of 36 cm height from Hlubock6 MaSivky has the arms slightly raised and her face lifted to the sky. 36 According to E. and J. Neustupnf 37 many specimens of this kind have been found; they were probably used in some sort of cult ceremony. There exists another plastic from Sti~pnovice, belonging to the painted ceramic of Moravia, with the arms raised high up, the hands being 30 Miiller-Karpe (n. 27 above), P1. 250, 5, 12-13, 16. 31 Ibid., P1. 215.

Skutil 39 attributes to it the attitude of adoration, in time and space widely spread. The plastic from Hlubock6, the biggest one until now known, was excavated in a settlement. To E. Salm and Fr. Vildomec 40 the attitude of an adorant is clearly given. They report on another specimen from the same settlement, which served as a handle of an earthen dish. This feature seems to point that food was consumed with a gesture of requesting or/and thankgiving. Similar clay figurines were not totally alien to Middle Europe as far as it was influenced by the peasant culture of the Danube region. But they are less realistic and significant. In France, the megalithic anthropomorphic menhir-statues show often persons with the arms on the breast or womb in an attitude of reverence or adoration 41 (Fig. 2d). The Bronze Age started in the Near East already about 3,000 B.C. there being protohistoric in age. In Europe the prehistoric Bronze Age began about 1,8o00 and ended 800 B.C. A great many figures of adorants appear now in the rock art of North Europe; there occur, moreover, bronze figurines. Among the cast-bronze statuettes from Grevens Vaenge in South Zealand, Denmark, there are two figures of men with horned helmets in a kneeling posture. Likewise, there occurs in a group, found in Firdal, a small kneeling female figurine with a lifted arm in front of a winding serpent. 42 According to C.-A. Althin, 43 this is a scene of adoration of the chthonic serpent. Another statuette from the same site represents a horned pair side by side in kneeling position. 44 A similar scene with a winding serpent and a standing man with highly upraised arms exists on a rock at Vintlyke, Bohuslin, Sweden. 45 38 W.-B.

In the rock art of Norway there occur likewise figures with uplifted hands (Fig. 3d), to all appearence adorants. 47 Besides these, a rock "den stora stenhellen" at Nylende, exhibits carved arms with spread fingers, which are probably an abbreviation of the gesture of praying. Sv. Marstrander 48 has studied these carvings and sees in them a symbol of power. The question, however, is whether the hand is an abbreviation of a divine or a human being? Most frequently men with upraised arms are found among the petroglyphs of Sweden, in Bohuslan as well as in Skine. We refer here only to a few undoubted figures of adorants; we mentioned already the scene of serpent adoration from Vintlyke. At Rished in Bohuslkin two men are depicted with uplifted arms and spread fingers, one springing or dancing above a solar disk. 49 The rock of Flyhoff includes among his carvings a scene with a man who has slightly uplifted arms, the right one ending in spread fingers, the left one holding an axe; at the side is a wheel-cross (Fig. 3b), the symbol of the sun. 50 At Tanum, Bohuslan, there are several carvings of the solar disk, surrounded by adorants. 51 Another carving shows a solar disk mounted on two wheels, reminding the famous sun-cart from Trundholm, and aside a sqatting adorant. 52 At Stora Backa, Bohuslkin, there are pictured many boats, animals, men bearing solar standards, and in four cases men with raised hands. 53 Similar adorants are depicted on a solar boat at Disisen, Backa. The same motif was found at Bro and at Finntorp, both near Tanum. 54 At Hvitlycke, Tanun, there are six adorants following a big person. 55 On a rock in Bohuslin 46 E.

In the last century, J. J. A. Wor- saak 58 has proposed the thesis that all the rock carvings were picture- fixed prayers. In Middle Europe we know only of a single similar carving, deci- phered on a slab of the stone cist of Anderlingen at Bremerf6rde in North Germany. It presents three male figures, one with an axe in the raised hand, the two others at his left and right with uplifted arms like adorants of the axe-god. 59 The neighbourhood to the nordic rock-carvings explains easily the connection with the nordic religio- mythical world. Another center of rock art is found in northern Italy, in the Val Camonica near Brescia and in the West Alps around Mount Bego. There occur many representations of adorants, mostly in connection with a symbol of the sun, in form of a ring, often radiating, or with a stag, because of its rays-like antler being the able animal of the sun. A single adorant appeares at Nadro, another in the Val Camonica. A scene of prayer or of dance around the stag-god is composed by three persons above a stag, mounted by a person likewise with uplifted arms. Another scene exhibits a radiate sun with many adorants. In another scene on a rock at Naquane there is a horseman with a radiate halo, lance and shield, obviously representing the sun-god, adored by two persons. Still another picture shows the sun-god with antlers, a serpent, and below aside a small adorant with uplifted arms. On the rock of Saints there are six carved hands, probably abbreviations of adorants. 60 At Mount Bego there occurs a carying on a slab depicting a person with raised arms, clothed in a kind of tunic, 61 to all appear- 56 Kiuhn (n. 52 above), Fig. 46. 57 Sprockhoff (n. 49 above), Fig. 6. 58s J.

From the island of Sardinia there come many votive bronze sta- tuettes; some of them represent adorants, others officiating priests as well as priestesses. 62 Their offering-gesture is akin to that of prayer, because both embrace the wide range of adoration. We encounter further votive bronze statuettes in East Europe, in Camunte, Caucasus, and near Kiev, Ukraine. 63 At Helenendorf, Transcaucasia, there were excavated decorated urns. Some of them show adorants, in one case, an adorant standing behind an animal, in another case an adorant with bow and arrow below a swastika, his weapons directed against an ibex (Fig. 3e), on a third urn an unarmed man behind an indistinct animal with raised arms. 64 In all these cases we met with hunters praying for game, in one case the recipient of the prayer is indicated by the symbol of the sun. Adorants occur very often in the art of the islands of Cyprus, Crete and Cyclades in the East Mediterranean. In the necropolis of Vounoi, Cyprus, there has been excavated a terracotta representing a ploughing-scene: a team of four oxes and, standing between them, a man with raised arms. 65 The same motif has been found on a seal in the contempory Near East. 66 Statuettes of adorants are numerous in Crete. From a sanctuary in the mountains of Maza near Kalochorio there come many male and female terracottas, votary figurines with stretched or raised arms. 67 Among the finds from the cemetery of Gournia in East Crete there are also clay figurines of adorants, the left arm hanging down, the right one lifted to the breast. 68 This attitude reminds of a gesture of humble surrender, undoubtedly to a deity. Other votary clay figurines were found in tombs of Kumasa, Siteia and Heraklion, mostly female with 62 Chr. Zervos, La civilisation de la Sardaigne, Paris I954, Figs. I08-III, 125, 460. 63 M.

From the palace sanctuary of Knossos there come a group of terracottas representing a goddess together with three attendants whose hands are covering the breasts. 70 There were also found many clay-statues, about 60 cm and more high, with uplifted arms; they obviously represent idols. Since the goddess is often re- presented in this attitude it may be a gesture of divine highness, not properly of adoration. This interpretation is supported by a scene on the plate of a gold ring from a grave at Isopata near Knossos, which includes four female persons in a festival attire, portraying the goddess and her devotees or priestesses. The alleged goddess has the arms upraised, likewise two of the attendants whereas the third one has only one arm raised, the other one hanging down. 71 The whole scene seems to depict the epiphania of the goddess to her devotees. The statuettes of adorants from Crete display a variety of gestures. A bronze statuette of a naked young male, 12 cm high, from the grotto of Psychro has the right hand in front of the breast, the left one hanging down. 72 Another bronze statuette, 16 cm high, from Palai- kastro has the right hand uplifted to the forehead, the left one hanging down. 73 The same gesture is shown by a bronze statuette of 23 cm height from Tylissos, 74 likewise by a stone statuette of 8,8 cm height from the palace of Phaistos, 75 finally by a bronze statuette of 16,5 cm height from Tylissos. 76 Another bronze statuette of 8,3 cm height from the grotto of Psychro has the right arm bent up to the head, the left one bent down with the hand in front of the breast. 77 Again another of 14,3 cm height from near Phaistos shows the upper part of the body curved strongly backward, the head inclined and both arms uplifted to the chin. 78 A female bronze adorant of i3 cm height from 69 Ibid., P1. 181. 70 Sp.

In the archipelago of the Cyclades there are adorants often painted on ceramic vessels. Their gesture of prayer or adoration is rather uniform: uplifted arms with spread fingers. s81 An unique document is a fragmentary diadem or belt of silver, found in the acropolis of Halandriani, island of Syros, which exhibits a cycladic adorant in front of a solar symbol. 82 The Iron Age of prehistoric Europe has not yielded specimens of adorants worth mentioning. An exception appears in North Europe. Thus we see in the decorations of the golden horns from Gallehus several adorants in kneeling as well as in sitting posture with raised arms. 83 Another document is a tapestry found in the Oseberg ship, a ship-grave in Norway. There is one figure of a warrier, wearing a horned helmet, with upraised arms, the right hand open with spread fingers, the left one holding up a sword below a cross symbol (Fig. 3f). There is further another figure, wearing a boar mask with upraised arms addressed to a shield with a cross symbol s4 (Fig. 3g). As we have seen, representations of adorants are very old and occurring through nearly all prehistoric ages. Their gestures and atti- tudes correspond surprisingly to the different forms quoted in our introduction. It may be of some interest that the posture of crossed hands resting on the breast or womb seems to have often been repeated on the corpses as a funeral rite, still today observed as a funeral custom. 5205 St. Augustini, JOHANNES MARINGER Anthropos-Institut 79 Ibid., Fig. 453. so Ibid., Fig. 497. s81 Chr.
