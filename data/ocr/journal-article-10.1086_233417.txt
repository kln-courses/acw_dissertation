Antony Most feminists today are suspicious of any appeal to the notion of ‘‘hu- man nature’’ in normative or political theory. This partly reflects the influence of postmodernism among feminist theorists: postmodernists reject foundationalism in general and are specifically critical of theories involving the universalistic category ‘‘humanity.’’ But there is another, more prosaic explanation for this concern, and that is the fact that ap- peals to nature have been used historically, and continue to be used, to rationalize and justify the perpetuation of oppressive gender roles. Sometimes the theme is deterministic: there are things that we women cannot do because of our natures (govern, for example), as well as things that must be tolerated in men because of theirs (cheating on their wives, fighting in wars). At other times the appeal is to a sort of self-interest: given our natures, we will be unhappy, or unfulfilled, or simply ‘‘unfem- inine’’ if we pursue certain goals or engage in certain activities. Often these two types of argument are combined, for a sort of lawyerly defense of gender roles: don’t try to do X— in the first place, you can’t do it, and in the second place, if you do do it, you’ll be sorry. Consider, for example, a recent offering from syndicated colum- nist George Will, praising a new book by Danielle Crittenden,What Our Mothers Didn’t Tell Us: Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman. Crittenden, according to Will, ‘‘says that feminism’s androgyny project fails for an intractable reason: it is unnatural’’ (my emphasis). Laying on the deter- minism, he continues: ‘‘Today’s feminism manifests liberalism’s utopian * The main stimulus for the reconsideration of ‘‘natures’’ that is the subject of this article was some sharp questioning from Marilyn Frye when I delivered a lecture at the National Humanities Center, Research Triangle Park, N.C., in 1998, when she was a fellow in residence.

I presented an early version of this work at the Martha Nussbaum Named Seminar at the Humanities Research Centre of the Australian National University in Canberra, ACT, Australia, in June 1999, and I’d like to thankmy fellow partici- pants in that seminar for their very helpful feedback.

Feminism’s grand dream is to escape the bonds of anatomy and refute the idea that biology is, in any sense, destiny.’’ 1 But what exactly is the ‘‘necessity’’ that we femi- nists try vainly to eliminate? What is the ‘‘destiny’’ to which our anatomy ‘‘binds’’ us? Well, the ‘‘destiny’’ that Crittenden and Will seem to have in mind is for women to become stay-at-home mothers. To which the obvi- ous objection is that this can’t literally be destiny for all women, since many women—manifestly—have not taken this course. But here’s where we change tack: indeed, many women have abjured the natural course, says Crittenden, says Will—that’s why they’re all so unhappy: ‘‘Critten- den sides with the anthropologist Lionel Tiger, who says, dryly, that if biology is not destiny, it certainly is ‘good statistical probability.’ Ignor- ing probability brings punishment. Feminism, having established that women are human, forgot that they are women, with distinctive desires, the ignoring of which causes unhappiness.’’ Having established the gen- eral point, Will spins out the specific consequences for women: ‘‘Women who ignore the wisdom that ‘we can have it all—but we cannot have it all at once’ comprise a ‘secret agony society.’Weary women trying to ‘bal- ance briefcase and baby’ are failing to convince themselves that ‘quality time’ is a substitute for lots of time. They go to work to escape domestic worries, but instead are consumed by them.’’ 2 So while our natures don’t quite tell us what we have to do, they do tell us what we have to do to be happy. It is hardly surprising, given the ubiquity and resilience of argu- ments of this sort, that many feminists see the whole idea of fixed ‘‘na- tures’’ as threatening— insisting, sometimes to the point of absurdity, on the malleability and contingency of all human characteristics.3 But it does not serve feminist purposes well for us to embrace a dogmatic social constructivism. The question whether there is anything like human na- ture is, at least in large part, an empirical issue and is not one that can be settled either by a priori reasoning or by legislation. Failure to ac- knowledge this opens us to the charge of Lysenkoism and plays into per- nicious stereotypes of feminists as dangerous loonies, zealots advocating ‘‘politically correct’’ views at the expense of science and common sense. We see the popular resonance of these stereotypes in Will’s rhetoric: by invoking them, he is able to portray Crittenden (and, by association, himself), as a daring freethinker, a bold visionary able to cast off the blinders feminism has imposed on all the rest of us: ‘‘This indicates just how out of joint the times are: Human nature is startling news. Asserting that there is a human nature has become a radical political act, which 1. George Will, ‘‘Marry Young and Have Youngsters Pronto,’’ Raleigh News and Ob- server (February 5, 1999). 2.

This troubles Danielle Crit- tenden not at all.’’ 4 Startling? Radical? The fact that biological determin- ism has never been without powerful champions troubles George Will not at all. But the problem I’ve been speaking of is not simply rhetorical: the tactical rejection of the view that human beings have natures simply concedes too much to feminism’s opponents. We need not agree—and should not give the appearance of agreeing—that the possibility of re- alizing feminist goals depends on there being nothing about us that is, in any sense, ‘‘true by nature,’’ for in one perfectly good sense of the phrase, there’s a great deal about us that falls into this category, and it would be a sad thing indeed if feminism required us to deny it. I believe that the fear that any concession to nativism can and will be used against us largely explains the unfortunate bias of many feminist and progressive theorists toward radically empiricist, social constructivist views of lan- guage and the mind, and their correlative hostility toward nativist ac- counts of the sort proposed by NoamChomsky in linguistics and bymany in cognitive psychology. The result, in my opinion, is a truly unfortunate disjunction between empirically well-grounded work in cognitive science and feminist discussions of language and the mind.5 There’s a particular irony in feminists claiming that nativist cognitive theory is expressive of a patriarchal point of view, and that is that many, if not most, of the lead- ing theorists in developmental psychology who are pushing nativist ac- counts are women: Lila Gleitman, Susan Carey, Elissa Newport, Barbara Landau, Elizabeth Spelke, Rochel Gelman, and Karen Wynn, to name but a few. Indeed, I’d venture to say that developmental psychology is the only branch of science dominated by women. 4. Will. 5.

Linda Alcoff and Elizabeth Potter (New York: Routledge, 1993), pp. 161–86. In her monograph,What’s Within: Nativism Reconsidered (New York:OxfordUni- versity Press, 1999), philosopher Fiona Cowie tries to convict Chomskian nativism about language acquisition of guilt by association with crude biological determinist prejudices, asserting that such disturbing trends as ‘‘the growing obsession here and abroad with racial, national and sexual differences’’ and ‘‘the newly fashionable backlash against attempts to enforce ideals of equality and civil rights’’ all ‘‘find a fertile seeding ground in the New Nativism’’ (p. x). This is utter nonsense and an attempt on Cowie’s part, I suspect, to enlist her reader’s presumably liberal sympathies against a theory with which she has philosophi- cal disagreements.

But I used to go further. In an earlier essay, I argued not only that feminists had no reason to reject the notion of human nature but that they had strong positive reason to embrace it.6 The notion of human nature could, I thought, provide a needed ground- ing for feminist critiques of the subordination of women. My reasoning was this: in order to explain what is wrong with patriarchy and to put forward our positive vision of equitable and sustaining human relation- ships, we need to affirm our humanity. We need, that is, to be able to assert two things: first, that we are essentially beings of a certain kind, and second, that there are modes of treatment that are appropriate, and others that are inappropriate, for beings of this kind. If we have no essen- tial nature as human beings, how are we to understand the complaint that certain kinds of treatment are ‘‘dehumanizing’’? Something very like this line of reasoning is present in the recent work of Martha Nussbaum, who appeals to what she calls ‘‘Aristotelian Essentialism’’ as the grounding for her ‘‘capabilities approach’’ to hu- man rights and social justice.7 The capabilities approach proposes to as- sess the justice of a given society by assessing the degree to which its members are in possession of a variety of capacities for human function- ing together with the opportunities for exercising and developing these capacities. Aristotelian essentialism is invoked in the generation of the list of these capabilities, by providing ‘‘an account of the most important functions of the human being, in terms of which human life is defined. The idea is that once we identify a group of especially important func- tions in human life, we are then in a position to ask what social and po- litical institutions are doing about them. Are they giving people what they need in order to be capable of functioning in all these human ways? And are they making it possible for citizens to functionwell? ’’ (HF, p. 214). Nussbaum thus promotes the idea that we can somehow find within our common human nature the outlines of a good human life, a life that counts as a flourishing one for creatures of our kind. I have recently come to the conclusion, however, that there is no plausible notion of human nature that can do quite this sort of norma- tive work. This is not to say that Nussbaum is wrong to emphasize the enormous degree to which all human experience is conditioned by the same complement of biological and psychological characteristics. As will 6. Louise Antony, ‘‘ ‘Human Nature’ and Its Role in Feminist Theory,’’ in Kourany, ed., pp. 63–91. 7.

My current point is rather this: the fact— if it is one—that such human universals as exist are due to our nature as human beings is itself of no ethical importance. To explain, I’ll need to back up and look more closely at the argu- mentative strategies that I said havemademany feminists wary of the very notion of a ‘‘nature.’’ 8 All arguments of this type involve a premise that asserts that the possession (or lack) of some property is due to the ‘‘na- ture’’ of the individual involved: N: So-and-so possesses/lacks property by nature. But the arguments differ in the way they move from this premise to their respective conclusions. ‘‘Deterministic’’ arguments (as I’ll call them) are meant to show the outright impossibility of some course of action or state of being, while ‘‘paternalistic’’ arguments are meant to show something like its undesirability or inappropriateness. To obtain these conclusions, each argument must supplement N with an appropriate ‘‘linking’’ prem- ise. Deterministic arguments must add a modal premise: D: What’s true by nature cannot be changed. And paternalistic arguments need a normative premise: P: What’s true by nature is good for you. But in order for the arguments to be valid, the notion of ‘‘nature’’ ap- pealed to in N must be the same as the notion appealed to in D or P. This turns out to be the stumbling block. ‘‘Nature’’ is many-ways ambigu- ous. And while it is relatively easy to find senses of nature that make N true for various properties, and possible to find senses that make D or P true, it turns out to be mightily difficult to find a single notion of nature that makes N and D or N and P true together. For example, one common meaning of ‘natural’ is ‘‘independent of human agency.’’ In this sense, it is uncontroversial that some people are nearsighted ‘‘by nature’’; that is, without human intervention, these people would not be able to see very clearly or very far away. But if we plug this sense of nature into either premise D or premise P we get patent falsehoods, as the case of nearsightedness shows. Poor eyesight is hardly irremediable, and there is certainly no reason to regard it as desirable. 8. For a more extensive discussion of these and other types of arguments from na- ture, see John Stuart Mill, The Subjection of Women, excerpted in Philosophy and Women, ed. Sharon Bishop and Marjorie Weinzweig (Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth, 1979), pp. 52–59; Joyce Trebilcot, ‘‘Sex Roles: The Argument from Nature,’’ in Philosophy of Woman, ed.

The trick in constructing a rhetori- cally effective argument from nature is to make premise N appear un- controversial—to make what’s ‘‘true by nature’’ seem a matter of simple observation or an uncontroversial finding from a neutral science—while at the same time preserving the modal or normative import that the term ‘nature’ frequently carries. But these two goals are at cross purposes. The most plausible instances of N will use a notion of ‘‘nature’’ that is modally and normatively flat: notions like ‘‘independent of human agency’’ or ‘‘statistically normal,’’ or even ‘‘part of our genetic endowment’’ (much more on this below). But the more purely descriptive the notion of na- ture—and hence the less controversial the resulting premise N—the less likely that the linking premises D or P will come out true without equivocation. There is also a pragmatic peculiarity that afflicts arguments of both these types, pointed out over two centuries ago by John Stuart Mill. In both cases, the truth of the conclusion seems to obviate the argument itself. Take first the deterministic argument: as Mill notes, if something cannot be done, it is pointless to enjoin against its being attempted: ‘‘The anxiety of mankind to interfere in behalf of nature, for fear lest nature should not succeed in effecting its purpose, is an altogether unnecessary solicitude. What women by nature cannot do, it is quite superfluous to forbid them from doing.’’ 9 Similarly, if one finds a particular social role or mode of life desirable, then one hardly needs to be argued into adopt- ing it: ‘‘If women have a greater natural inclination for some things than for others, there is no need of laws of social inculcation to make the ma- jority of themdo the former in preference to the latter.’’ 10Millfinds these points so obvious that he indulges in some dark speculation as to the real motives of those who would enlist nature in these ways: ‘‘They might be supposed to think that the alleged natural vocation of women was of all things the most repugnant to their nature; insomuch that if they are free to do anything else— if any other means of living, or occupation of their time and faculties, is open, which has any chance of appearing desirable to them—there will not be enough of them who will be willing to accept the condition said to be natural to them.’’ 11 This all applies quite generally to arguments from nature. It applies, as should be obvious, to the Will-Crittenden brief summarized above, but it applies with equal force to progressive attempts to enlist the notion of human nature in the grounding of egalitarian philosophies. And herein lies the sad moral of my tale: there is no way of understanding ‘‘natures’’ 9. Mill, p. 55. 10. Ibid. 11.

In particular, Nussbaum’s appeal to human na- ture, her ‘‘Aristotelian Essentialism,’’ can’t work. Despite its far greater subtlety, her argument suffers the same liabilities as Will and Critten- den’s: they stand or fall together. 1. Externalist and Internalist Appeals to Human Nature I said above that arguments from nature tend to be plagued by internal tensions—that premise N needed a modally and normatively neutral sense of nature, while premises D and P needed a sense that retained modal or normative implications—and that this is no less true for argu- ments that appeal to ‘‘natures’’ to ground progressive political programs than it is for their evil twins. We can put the dilemma in different terms, terms that Nussbaum herself supplies. In a discussion of Bernard Williams’s writing on human nature, Nussbaum distinguishes ‘‘external’’ accounts of human nature from ‘‘in- ternal’’ accounts. An external account, the sort of account that Williams attributes to Aristotle, treats facts about what is essentially human as ‘‘matters of natural scientific fact, not of ethical value.’’ Such facts, it is imagined, can be ascertained ‘‘from the totally external standpoint of a neutral observer,’’ an observer, that is, who has no knowledge of nor any commitment to human practices or values. It follows, on this conception, that the details of the account will ‘‘not be based (or not primarily or solely based) upon . . . ordinary beliefs and conceptions’’ and also that such details will be ‘‘uncontroversial in a way that ethical questions usu- ally are not. Although the answers to such questions may be difficult to discover, the fact that they are matters for scientific inquiry means that they can, in principle, be settled in a more satisfyingly decisive way than questions of ethical value judgment’’ (HN, p. 88). An external account of human nature will thus have the rhetorically attractive features of verifiability and objectivity. Beyond that, however, an external account might appear to offer real help to ethical theory. Because such an ac- count provides a set of ‘‘fixed points’’ about what human beings are like—a set of facts neither relative to individual human interests nor subject to human choice or decision— it promises to (in Nussbaum’s words) ‘‘effectively rule out certain ethical alternatives, and perhaps also give positive support for certain others’’ (HN, p. 88). It could tell us what can and cannot be done to various kinds of beings by providing ‘‘hard, value-neutral constraints against ‘atrocity’ ’’ (HN, p. 88). In contrast, Nussbaum tells us, an internal account of human nature makes no pretense of abjuring appeal to values. It constructs its account of what is essential to a human being by drawing explicitly on the norms and values embodied in human practices, using human beings’ own judgments about what makes their lives ‘‘human’’ to sort human charac- </page> <page sequence="8"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 15   # 8 Antony Natures and Norms 15 teristics into the essential and the accidental. As Nussbaum explains in an earlier article, Such an account would say: take away properties X, Y, and Z (a suntan, let us say, or a knowledge of Chinese, or an income of $40,000 a year) and we will still have what we count as a human being on our hands. On the other hand, take away properties A, B, and C (the ability to think about the future, say, or the ability to respond to the claims of others, or the ability to choose and act) and we no longer have a human life at all. Separating these groups of properties requires an evaluative inquiry: for we must ask, which things are so important that we will not count a life as a human life without them? Such an evaluative inquiry into what is deepest and most indispensable in our lives need not presuppose an external metaphysical foundation, clearly: it can be a way of looking at our- selves, asking what we really think about ourselves and what holds our history together. (HF, pp. 207–8) Now it might be thought that an account of human nature based on what we human beings value most about ourselves is really just a different kind of external account—that instead of consulting science to see what the deep explanatory structure of the species Homo sapiens is, we might instead consult the pollsters to see what consensus we can achieve on the question, ‘‘What about yourself do you think is most important?’’ But I’m sure that this is not what Nussbaum has in mind. The upshot of such a sociological survey would yield purely descriptive information; it would carry no normative implications. Instead, I think that Nussbaum thinks it essential that the author of such a genuinely internal account of hu- man nature not be a neutral observer of human society. The author must know human life ‘‘from the inside.’’ The point of Nussbaum’s emphasis on the internal perspective is, in this context at least, to encourage us to interpret the claim that this or that aspect of human life is part of our nature as being as much an expression of the theorist’s own self-conception as a description of how other human beings conceive themselves. This is how the internal ac- count is meant to achieve its normativity, I think: for me to claim that, for example, practical reason is part of human nature is tantamount to my endorsing the evaluative judgment that the ability to consider rea- sons and to act in accordance with them is essential to a life worth living for beings like myself. With this distinction between external and internal accounts of hu- man nature, then, I can put my challenge this way: appeals to external accounts of human nature can be expected to garner interpersonal agreement that’s independent of normative judgments but, for that very reason, will not be able to generate reasons for accepting ethical propo- sitions about what human beings should or should not do. Appeals to </page> <page sequence="9"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 16   # 9 16 Ethics October 2000 internal accounts can generate ethical conclusions, but the crucial prem- ise about human nature will only be acceptable to someone who ante- cedently endorses the value judgments embodied therein, rendering the appeal itself otiose. Nussbaum, it turns out, agrees with the first part of my diagnosis but not the second. In discussing Williams’s criticisms of external accounts, focusing on attempts to generate ethical conclusions from descriptive evolutionary accounts of human behavior, she finds Williams’s worries decisive: the considerations Williams raises against sociobiology ‘‘cast doubt not only on some particular projects of giving ethics a scientific foundation, but on the whole idea that ethics could be meaningfully and convincingly grounded on an account given from the external per- spective’’ (HN, p. 90). Nonetheless, she thinks she can offer Williams— and, by implication, the rest of us who have championed externalist arguments—some reassurance: although we are right that externalist ac- counts will always be, just because of their externality, disconnected from ethics, we are wrong to think, therefore, that the project of grounding substantive ethical theory in an account of human nature is hopeless: ‘‘The external account, as Williams characterizes it, is neither necessary nor sufficient for providing ethics with a foundation’’ (HN, p. 90). Nuss- baum, in other words, wants to embrace the second horn of the dilemma I drew above: she thinks she can get an internalist account of human nature to do the work that an externalist account initially promised but cannot deliver. To evaluate this suggestion of Nussbaum’s, we’ll need to look in much more detail both at the work that she thinks an internal account of human nature can and must do and at the specifics of the account she has to offer. I will argue that Nussbaum’s account does not work; she appears to evade the dilemma only because she slides back and forth between external and internal accounts, depending on the work to be done or the dangers to be avoided. Before making my case in detail, though, let me digress briefly to say something about two kinds of ‘‘exter- nal’’ accounts of human nature that I think are plausibly available to us. The first of these concerns what I’ll call a ‘‘scientific nature.’’ On this model, which derives from Locke’s notion of a ‘‘real essence,’’ a na- ture is an underlying (and possibly hidden) structure that plays a cen- tral role in the explanation of the thing’s more superficial and manifest properties. Kripke and Putnam have argued persuasively that members of natural kinds have ‘‘natures’’ in this sense: the atomic number of elements and the molecular structure of chemical compounds, for ex- ample, serve to explain the distinctive profile of properties and disposi- tions of things of these kinds. I’ve argued elsewhere that genotype is a plausible candidate for being the ‘‘scientific essence’’ of a biological or- ganism, since the organism’s genes provide the categorical grounding for the hierarchy of dispositions that characterizes that particular organ- </page> <page sequence="10"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 17   # 10 Antony Natures and Norms 17 ism.12 This is not to endorse what’s often called ‘‘biological determin- ism’’—the doctrine that some phenotypic property or properties are fixed by an organism’s genes. As every first-year biology student knows, an organism’s set of observable features— its phenotype— is not deter- mined by genotype alone but, rather, is the causal product of a particular genotype operating in a particular environment. What the genotype de- termines is only a very complex function from environmental circum- stances to phenotypic properties—what’s called in biology a ‘‘norm of reaction.’’ 13 There are two consequences of this view of the scientific natures of biological organisms that are worth noting in this context. First, on this view it will never be strictly correct to say that any phenotypic property is part of an organism’s nature. This in itself is enough to refute most of the pernicious appeals to human nature, which typically involve a con- fusion between the disposition to display a certain property in certain circumstances, which may be fixed by the genotype, and the actual dis- play of that property, which can never be attributed entirely to the geno- type. This is not to say that we can make no sense out of claims that some phenotypic property is ‘‘genetic’’ or ‘‘innate.’’ It frequently happens that the genetic mechanisms that underlie and direct the development of some physical organ or structure are relatively insensitive to variation in most environmental variables or at least to the variation present in (sta- tistically) normal environments. This is what is meant—or what one ought to mean— in saying, for example, that it’s part of a horse’s nature to have four legs. In the case of human phenotypic traits, we tend to be particularly interested in contrasting those traits whose development is systematically sensitive to variation in our cognitive or social environments with those traits whose development is not. Whether a person acquires the pheno- typic property of playing a musical instrument or knowing the rules of chess depends crucially on whether the person has certain specific types of experience; whether a person comes to engage in what Aristotle would call ‘‘practical reasoning’’ is not so dependent. But this is not to say that human cognitive capacities are completely determined by our genes, in- dependently of all experience. Thus, when Noam Chomsky says that the capacity to acquire language is part of our genetic endowment, as he frequently does, he is not saying that every human being will inevitably speak; he is perfectly aware that a certain amount of exposure to nor- 12.

(The ‘‘critical period’’ for language acquisition, after all, is part of his theory, and not of his non- nativist rivals.) Rather, Chomsky should be understood to be saying (a) that the development of language in humans is not dependent on the particular kinds and patterns of environmental contingencies that alternative accounts of language acquisition (e.g., behaviorism) have held to be causally necessary and (b) that the acquired competence is, at an interesting level of abstraction, the same across synchronic and dia- chronic variation in human belief systems and social organization, just as are the rough outlines of human physical development. The second consequence of my view to which I’d like to call atten- tion is that, for complex biological organisms, individual natures become logically and explanatorily prior to the natures of kinds. It’s certainly true that there are many reliable regularities in the phenotypes of individuals grouped together as members of the same species. And there are also systematic differences between members of different species. Genetic similarity and variation, in these cases, explain the observed patterns. So it is not mere accident that (almost all) horses have four legs, whereas (almost all) human beings have two, nor that (almost all) human beings acquire a language by the time they are five years old, whereas no horses ever do. But this does not mean that there is anything like an ideal or even a typical genetic type that could serve to define equinity or hu- manity.14 If there is any sense to be made of the notion of ‘‘the human genome,’’ it must be done by generalizing over or abstracting from the genotypes of individuals antecedently identified as human. But in that case, what does govern the identification of individuals as human? This question brings us to the second sort of external account of ‘‘natures’’ available to us, what I’ll call ‘‘definitional natures.’’ Na- tures in this sense are the necessary and sufficient conditions for being a thing of a certain kind. If Kripke and Putnam are right, then definitional natures coincide with scientific natures for some kinds of things. But there are many kinds of things that do not have scientific natures at all, and yet it is still the case that we can say what it is to be things of those types. The most persuasive examples I can offer are artifact kinds and socially constructed kinds. To be a knitting needle to have a certain char- acteristic shape, to have been constructed with a certain function in 14. The fact that even the most ubiquitous species characteristic could fail to be ex- pressed in some as-yet-unrealized environment, together with the fact that wide ranges of variation in certain traits are present within all complex species, show the folly and, per- haps, the confusion inherent in the idea of a genetic ideal form. For discussion, see Richard Lewontin, ‘‘The Dream of the Human Genome,’’ in his Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA (New York: HarperCollins, 1991), pp. 59–83; and Philip Kitcher, ‘‘Essence andPerfec- tion,’’ Ethics 110 (1999): 59–83.

If my arguments above are cor- rect, then biological species do not themselves have scientific essences (though their members do) but have, instead, functional or historical essences, like artifacts. Indeed, they would be artifacts of a certain kind— groupings produced by human scientific interest in robust empirical regularities. It’s important to realize that, despite the fact that definitional na- tures are created, either explicitly or implicitly, by human practices and conventions, once these practices and conventions are in place, it is a perfectly objective matter what the definitional natures are. Further- more, since human practices are not necessarily transparent, even to those who engage in them, it may take empirical investigation to find out what a definitional nature is. Finally, definitional natures need not have anything to do with values or norms— it’s one thing to discover what the conditions of U.S. citizenship are and quite another to decide if you think it’s a good or a bad thing that they are as they are. For all these reasons, I think an account of the definitional nature of the kind ‘‘hu- man being’’ should be classified as an external account, according to the criteria Nussbaum gives in her discussion of Williams. It’s also important to note that definitional natures can generate only de dicto necessities and not de re necessities. The conventions of En- glish may determine that, as a matter of necessity, every mother is the parent of a child; that is, linguistic conventions ensure that if someone is a mother, then that person is the parent of a child. But it will not follow from this that any given person who is a mother had to have been the parent of a child; this will only be true if it’s necessary for that person to have been a mother, and that’s a matter that human conventions cannot determine. Another way of putting this: it may be part of the nature of being a mother to be the parent of a child; that doesn’t entail that it’s part of my nature to be the parent of a child, even if it happens to be true that I am a mother. Thus, the question of whether it is part of my individual nature to be a human being, a material object, a woman, a philosopher, or anything else is not a question that can be settled by appeal to the linguistic practices governing our use of the words ‘human being’, ‘material object’, and so on, even if those practices can settle the question of what it is to be a human being. That raises the vexed question of what, if anything, does determine what constitutes the nature, in the definitional sense, of an individual. Philosophical tradition bids us settle the matter by thought experiment: what kinds of changes could I undergo and still be me? What properties could I have lacked and still have been me? By appeal to their own— generally referred to as ‘‘our’’— intuitions, philosophers have defended </page> <page sequence="13"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 20   # 13 20 Ethics October 2000 a variety of conflicting claims about what is essential to a being like me: Descartes famously thinks it’s only necessary that I be a thinking thing, while Kripke argues that I must have had the particular physical origin that I in fact had. Some feminist philosophers have argued that my gender is essential to me; others deny this.15 Some philosophers think that my personhood is essential to me; I myself feel I can make sense of the possibility that (due, perhaps, to environmental contingencies that could have but fortunately did not obtain when I was an infant) I might have lacked the higher cognitive functions that I think are definitive of personhood. Despite the lack of consistency in ‘‘results,’’ however, the judgments elicited by these thought experiments are held to be, by those who en- gage in them, judgments of objective modal fact. And this is true whether these modal facts are taken to be ‘‘deep necessities’’ or, like definitional natures of kinds, the products of human convention. I mention this be- cause as long as we defend claims about individual definitional essences by reference to these sorts of thought experiments, we are still in the realm of external accounts of the nature of individual human beings. There’s another sort of thought experiment we can perform, however, that also tells us, in a sense, what we take to be essential to our existence, and that is to ask, instead of what changes I think I could not endure and still exist, what changes I think would make my life not worth living. A thought experiment of this sort—which, as we’ll see, is the method Nuss- baum endorses—cannot produce an external account of human nature, because it is an explicit appeal to my values. Now let’s turn to the matter of the inconsistency I find in Nuss- baum’s use of the notions of ‘‘internal’’ and ‘‘external’’ accounts. In her exegesis of Williams, as we’ve seen, she makes the distinction between internal and external accounts essentially a matter of the distinction be- tween the descriptive and the normative. Both my dilemma and Wil- liams’s concern internal and external accounts in this sense. But later in the essay on Williams, and in other work where she presents her positive ‘‘internalist’’ appeal to human nature, Nussbaum characterizes internal accounts in an importantly different way. Here’s how the equivocation comes about. In HF, Nussbaum surveys the objections that have been made to es- sentialist ethical theories (I’ll present the full set of these objections be- low) and contends that many of these are really directed against a meta- physical view that is presumed to be a necessary part of any form of essentialism but which can in fact be separated from it. She explains that this metaphysical view, which she calls, following Putnam, ‘‘metaphysical realism,’’ ‘‘claims that there is some determinate way that the world is 15. See Iris Young, ‘‘Humanism, Gynocentrism, and Feminist Politics,’’ in herThrow- ing like a Girl and Other Essays (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990). </page> <page sequence="14"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 21   # 14 Antony Natures and Norms 21 apart from the interpretive workings of the cognitive faculties of living beings. A description of the world is true just in case it corresponds to that independently existing structure, false insofar as it does not so cor- respond’’ (HF, p. 206). An essentialism that’s backed by metaphysical realism will hold that ‘‘the way the human being essentially is will be a part of the independent furniture of the universe, something the gods can see and study independently of human life and human history’’ (HF, p. 206). An essentialism of this sort, Nussbaum contends, is rightly criti- cized on the grounds that its metaphysical presuppositions are unaccept- able, perhaps even incoherent: ‘‘If the only available (or perhaps even coherent) picture of reality is one in the derivation of which human interpretations play a part, if the only defensible conceptions of truth and knowledge hold truth and knowledge to be in certain ways depen- dent on human cognitive activity within history, then the hope for a pure unmediated account of our human essence as it is in itself, apart from history and interpretation, is no hope at all but a deep confusion’’ (HF, p. 207). But one needn’t be a metaphysical realist to be an essentialist, Nussbaum argues. One can be an internalist about human essences: ‘‘One might, that is, believe that the deepest examination of human his- tory and human cognition from within still reveals a more or less deter- minate account of the human being, one that divides the essential from its accidental properties’’ (HF, p. 207). But there’s independence from human cognitive activity and inde- pendence from human cognitive activity: the debate about metaphysical realism is, as Nussbaum is careful to note, a complex one, ‘‘involving technical issues in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of lan- guage’’ (HF, p. 207). Specifically, the question is whether the fact that any thought or talk about extrahuman reality must employ human con- cepts and human terms means that we can sensibly conceive a reality that exists ‘‘prior to’’ or ‘‘independently of ’’ the categorizations we impose on it. Partisans of metaphysical realism argue that stuff in the world is what it is, regardless of what we call it; opponents challenge the partisans to say what that way of being is. But the point here is that, whatever the upshot of this philosophical debate, it cannot turn out that there is no distinction to be made between matters that are up to human beings to determine (like what the rights of citizenship are or where we go to din- ner) and matters that are quite out of our control (the age of the Earth, the amount of force exerted by a speeding car onto a concrete embank- ment). Such distinctions are, if you will, ‘‘internal,’’ in the sense relevant to the metaphysical realism debate, to our descriptions of the world— they are part of the practice of human discourse, which recognizes the tininess of the region of space-time that human beings happen to oc- cupy. (People do get confused about all this, of course. Here’s a rule of thumb: if you find yourself saying that ‘‘it used to be true’’ that the Earth was flat, then you are not [as it were] getting the rules of our language </page> <page sequence="15"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 22   # 15 22 Ethics October 2000 game—either the rules involving ‘‘the Earth’’ and ‘‘flat,’’ or the ones involving ‘‘true’’ and ‘‘used to be.’’) So it shouldn’t follow from a rejection of metaphysical realism that the distinction between that which is up to us and that which is not up to us completely collapses. The distinction may need to be characterized in some different way, some way that doesn’t appeal to ‘‘unmediated’’ or ‘‘transcendent’’ reality, or perhaps should be relativized to a particular human language or to the human ‘‘conceptual scheme,’’ but it must still be possible when all is said and done to assert truly that there were and would have been dinosaurs even if we had never evolved to name them ‘dinosaur’, while there would not have been baseball players had we never evolved to invent the game of baseball. Neither should it follow from a rejection of metaphysical realism that the fact/value distinction collapses. If antirealism entails that there is no difference between saying ‘‘mothers do want to stay home with their kids’’ and ‘‘mothers ought to want to stay home with their kids,’’ then so much the worse for anti- realism. Once again, the issue should become a matter of how certain distinctions are to be explicated, not whether they can be drawn at all. But in that case, if all the internalismofNussbaum’s account amounts to is a rejection ofmetaphysical realism, thenher commitment to keeping her account internal won’t preclude her fromdrawing elements of her ac- count from conceptions of human nature that are externalist in the origi- nal, that is, nonnormative, sense to get her ‘‘fixed points’’ but then switch- ing to a normative conception to generate the ethical conclusions. Then, too, her diagnosis of opposition to essentialist theories as misdirected op- position to metaphysical realism gives her a false sense of security about her vulnerability to the dilemma. As she herselfmakes clear, the apparent value of externalist accounts— in the original sense—derives from their independence from human values, not from their transcendental inde- pendence of all forms of human conceptualization. If Nussbaum’s ‘‘inter- nalism’’ is only the internalism of a committed antimetaphysical realist, then we have no assurance that the features of the account she offers that make it look attractive for foundationalist purposes are not the very fea- tures that will inevitably isolate it from the ethical principles and judg- ments of value it is supposed to ground. I believe that this is exactly the case: the internalist account of hu- man nature that Nussbaum finds in Aristotle, and which she offers to us as a replacement for the externalist account described by Williams, still falls prey to the dilemma. The more it invokes facts about human beings that are decidable independently of value judgments, the less the nor- mative import; but the more normative material the account of human nature builds in, the less persuasive it becomes as a foundation for any particular ethical vision. That this latter point is true will be seen when we reflect on the similarities between the arguments Nussbaum offers and those of Crittenden and Will. </page> <page sequence="16"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 23   # 16 Antony Natures and Norms 23 I turn, finally, to Nussbaum’s account. Let’s begin with the reasons why Nussbaum thinks an account of human nature is necessary at all and then consider whether her account is adequate by her own lights. She says, in general, that ‘‘I have said that we urgently need a version of es- sentialism in public life. If we reject it, we reject guidance that is crucial if we are to construct an adequate account of distributive justice to guide public policy in many areas’’ (HF, p. 229). I can identify at least three areas where Nussbaum thinks we clearly need ‘‘guidance,’’ and where she believes an account of human nature is what must provide it. Each of these areas provides the ground for one of the three main criticisms of essentialist theory that Nussbaum is concerned to address. So the adequacy of her internalist Aristotelian essentialism by her own lights is going to depend on whether the account of human nature it provides can do the work at hand while skirting the specific dangers endemic to each job. 2. A Substantive Theory of ‘‘Harm’’ Perhaps the most important thing a theory of human nature can do, according to Nussbaum, is to tell us concretely and absolutely what kinds of treatment constitute damage to a human being. Here Nussbaum is concerned to oppose a particularly pernicious form of relativism, a form that parades as sensitivity and toleration but is really expressive of a kind of alienated indifference to what should be uncontroversially recog- nized as the mistreatment of fellow human beings. She refers, by way of illustration, to a presentation by a French anthropologist at an interna- tional conference, discussing the successful British campaign to eradi- cate smallpox in India. Because the campaign led to the demise of the cult of Sittala Devi, who had been thought to control the disease, the anthropologist thought that the campaign was a good example of West- ern insensitivity to difference. An audience member, an Indian, demurs: ‘‘Surely it is better to be healthy rather than ill, to live rather than die.’’ Not necessarily at all, says the anthropologist; such preferences may simply be the result of a peculiarly Western way of conceiving the world (HF, pp. 203–4). Nussbaum is appalled: is the anthropologist mad? It is as if one were to say, ‘‘Of course, I would find it insupportably awful to have painful, hemorrhaging sores covering my body, with premature death providing the only prospect of relief, but perhaps in other cul- tures, such things don’t matter so much.’’ 16 What needs to be kept in focus, Nussbaum argues, is that we are all human beings. This entails that we are all subject to certain physical con- 16. To get a vivid idea of what the rigors of smallpox actually are, together with the amount of suffering the disease has visited on human populations, I refer the reader to Ni- colau Barquet and Pere Domingo, ‘‘Smallpox: The Triumph over the Most Terrible of the Ministers of Death,’’Annals of Internal Medicine 127 (October 1997): 635–42. Also available on the internet at http://www.acponline.org/journals/annals/15oct97/smallpox.htm. </page> <page sequence="17"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 24   # 17 24 Ethics October 2000 straints and liabilities, whatever our historical and social location. If we forget this— if we persuade ourselves that difference is unbounded and unpredictable—then we lose our ability to recognize the suffering of others. I don’t know if the following connection occurred to Nussbaum, but my mind was drawn immediately by her anthropologist case to the image of General Westmoreland in the filmHearts and Minds, reassuring an American journalist that we didn’t need to be too concerned about civilian casualties in Vietnam because ‘‘Asians just don’t value life the same way we do.’’ 17 At the same time, though, Nussbaum acknowledges the legitimacy of the concern that the French anthropologist is raising, however inaptly in the particular case. The first of the three charges that ‘‘any good inter- nalist account will need to answer’’ is thus the charge that essentialist theories neglect difference. As Nussbaum presents it, the complaint is this: ‘‘People . . . understand human life and humanness in widely differ- ent ways, and any attempt to produce a list of ‘essential properties’ is bound to enshrine certain understandings of the human and to demote others. Usually . . . this takes the form of enshrining the understanding of a dominant group at the expense of minority understandings’’ (HF, p. 208). So what we must consider is whether Nussbaum’s internalist es- sentialism can give her the tools she needs to block radical relativism about human harm and well-being, without committing her to an equally unjustified and pernicious chauvinism. 3. Justification of Normative Distinctions among People’s Actual Preferences and Desires Nussbaum wants to be able to do this because she is opposed—quite rightly, in my view—to bare utility-maximizing models of human flour- ishing and social justice, models that take no account of the ways in which oppressive conditions can shape desire and limit imagination. If we measure a society’s success in providing for the well-being of its citi- zens purely by the levels of expressed satisfaction, we risk missing serious harms. Nussbaum illustrates the point with a case from India: ‘‘A poll of widowers and widows in India showed that the widowers were full of com- plaint about their health status; the widows, on the other hand, in most cases ranked their health status as ‘good.’ On the other hand, a medical examination showed that the widows were actually suffering far more than the males from diseases associated with nutritional deficiency. The point was that they had lived all their lives expecting that women will eat less, and the weakened health status produced in this way was second nature to them’’ (HF, p. 230). A proper account of human nature, Nuss- baum contends, will tell us that the widows’ ‘‘satisfaction’’ was illusory, 17. Hearts and Minds, mm, 112 min., BBS Productions, 1974. </page> <page sequence="18"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 25   # 18 Antony Natures and Norms 25 inauthentic, or otherwise inappropriate for human beings. By telling us what makes human life ‘‘human,’’ such an account will tell us, inter alia, the amounts of nutrition a human being needs to engage in any of the projects characteristic of human life and, hence, what levels of nutrition one ought to expect. Anyone who is satisfied with less counts as an in- jured person. I agree that any progressive political theory—feminism prominently included— is going to have to draw such distinctions and that it must say something in defense of the distinctions it draws. All such theories want an objective criterion of oppression; they want the injustice of a certain social arrangement to depend on something other than the subjective states of the individuals who are subject to the injustice, since it must be acknowledged that even severely oppressive conditions do not always produce subjective unhappiness. (And, of course, the converse is even more obviously true— it doesn’t take oppression or injustice for one to be perfectly miserable.)18 They all want to allow for the possibility, at least, of false consciousness—the condition wherein the oppressed in- ternalize a theory that rationalizes and normalizes their own oppres- sion—and to show that the creation of false consciousness is itself a form of injury. Feminists, in particular, do not want to have to deny that many women are, by any ordinary measure, perfectly happy within the gender roles prescribed for them by tradition or law. We do want to emphasize the extent and depth of the misery that sexism causes in the lives of many women. But we do not want to rest there. We want also to object to the ways in which patriarchal practices constrain women’s goals and self- conceptions so that some options for being and living in the world are made, for women, practically unavailable and even unimaginable. This will require us to say something substantive about which kinds of options ought to be open to women and why. But once again, there is lurking in the background a genuine con- cern: we ought not move too quickly to discount someone’s stated pref- erences and values and should be suspicious of anyone who presumes to take over for some other individual the prerogative to define the indi- vidual’s own life. Nussbaum calls this criticism the charge of ‘‘neglect of autonomy’’: ‘‘By determining in advance what elements of human life have most importance, the essentialist is failing to respect the right of people to choose a plan of life according to their own lights, determining what is most central and what is not’’ (HF, p. 230). This charge must have resonance for any feminist, since it has been the position of most patri- archal authorities throughout history that women cannot be trusted to craft their own lives and values but must, for their own good, have these set for them by their superiors. 18. See Marilyn Frye’s discussion of this point in ‘‘Oppression,’’ in her The Politics of Reality (Freedom, Calif.: Crossing, 1983). </page> <page sequence="19"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 26   # 19 26 Ethics October 2000 4. The Extent of Our Normative Community Here Nussbaum’s idea is that an account of human nature which tells us which characteristics of human life are really essential to it can do extra duty by entailing that anyone who possesses these characteristics is hu- man. Then, since the human nature we are considering is an avowedly normative notion, to conclude that someone is human is to conclude that that individual is part of our moral community and should be ac- corded appropriate respect. Still and all, Nussbaum credits the worry that she calls the charge of ‘‘prejudicial application.’’ The complaint is that to select any set of hu- man properties or capacities and distinguish them as ‘‘essential’’ is to set the stage for denying precisely those properties or capacities to those people one wishes to keep subordinate. ‘‘If we operate with a determi- nate conception of the human being that is meant to have some norma- tive moral and political weight, we must also, in applying it, ask which beings we take to fall under the concept. Here, the objector notes that all too easily the powerless can be excluded’’ (HF, p. 209). This, again, is a charge that feminists must take especially seriously, for theorists of human nature historically have not constrained themselves to include women among the set of individuals whose ‘‘essential nature’’ is being described, and they quite sanguinely write of women’s lacking the very properties they have just finished identifying as definitive of humanity. So, finally, what is this internalist account of human nature, and how does Nussbaum get it? The details of the account are very easily given, a fact that belies the immense amount of research and reflection that clearly went into its construction. The account, as she offers it in HF, has two levels. The first is a list of factors common to all human lives, a list that includes, Nussbaum emphasizes, both capabilities and limitations. The list includes mortality, the fact of embodiment (together with the particular form of human embodiment, which itself generates a list of factors: the need for food and drink, the need for shelter, sexual desire, and the capacity for mobility), the capacity for pleasure and pain, various distinctive cognitive capabilities, prolonged neoteny, the capacity for and exercise of practical reason, the capacity and the desire for affiliation with other human beings, the fact of relatedness to other species and to nature, the capacity for humor and play, and the fact of separateness (HF, pp. 216–20). These factors define, collectively, a ‘‘threshold of ca- pability to function, beneath which a life will be so impoverished that it will not be human at all’’ (HF, p. 220). The second level of the account itemizes the factors that define ‘‘a somewhat higher threshold, beneath which those characteristic functions are available in such a reduced way that although we may judge the form of life a human one, we will not think it a good human life’’ (HF, p. 221). These factors basically spin out the consequences of recognizing the ubiquity of factors at the first level: </page> <page sequence="20"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 27   # 20 Antony Natures and Norms 27 insofar as mortality is an essential element of human life, so ‘‘being able to live to the end of a complete human life . . . not dying prematurely’’ is a level of function that is necessary for a good human life, a life that we would be satisfied to have (HF, p. 222). The methodology that produced this account is somewhat more difficult to explain, for while Nussbaum tells us that her internalist essen- tialism is Aristotelian, it is not the standard (or, at any rate, the most well- known) way of interpreting Aristotle’s views on human nature. Nuss- baum claims that the familiar passages in Nicomachean Ethics 1.7, where Aristotle presents his ‘‘human function’’ argument, are frequently mis- interpreted so as to present Aristotle as attempting an externalist ac- count of human nature, an account that will ‘‘move from natural fact to ethical value,’’ but she argues that this is not Aristotle’s aim at all. The difference between the two interpretations depends very largely on how we interpret Aristotle’s method for finding the function of the human being. On both accounts, the argument begins the same way. Aristotle wants to know what constitutes happiness, or ‘‘flourishing’’ (eudaimonia), for a human being. He points out that, in general, if we can discover the distinctive functions of a kind of thing, we can answer the question what counts as ‘‘good’’ for a thing of that kind and so we can answer the ques- tion we want by discovering what, if anything, is the function of a human being. ‘‘For just as a flute-player, a sculptor, or any artist, and, in general, for all things that have a function or activity, the good and the ‘well’ is thought to reside in the function, so would it seem to be for man, if he has a function.’’ 19 But now how do we go about discovering the function of a human being? On the received view, Aristotle recommends that we look for that activity or capacity that is distinctive of human beings, some- thing which differentiates us from everything else. This differentiating capacity then turns out to be reason, and the function of human life is, accordingly, the exercise of reason. The good human life is, then, the life organized around reason, and a diminished or base human life is a life in which reason is damaged or ill-used. Now this is clearly an externalist account of human nature in the original sense of ‘‘externalist,’’ for the method it has Aristotle recom- mending for discovering the function of the human being is one that can be applied by any sufficiently careful observer— it simply involves learn- ing what human beings can do that nothing else can do. We do not need to know anything about what any human being values in order to dis- cover the essence of a human life. A reasonable extension of this method to human beings as we understand them today might even yield an ac- count of either the scientific nature of an individual human being or the 19. Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1.7, excerpted in Leslie Stevenson, ed., The Study of Human Nature (New York: Oxford University Press, 1981), p. 71. </page> <page sequence="21"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 28   # 21 28 Ethics October 2000 definitional nature of humankind. The externality of the account, in ei- ther case, would certify both the objectivity and the value neutrality of the properties on the list. Nussbaum, however, contends that this is not the strategy Aristotle had in mind. In the first place, she argues, he never intended for us, in characterizing human function, to divorce the differentiating features of human life from all the other features that in fact make that life possible. ‘‘On this interpretation, ‘the life of E-ing’means a life organized around E-ing, a life in which E-ing is the distinctive and guiding feature that gives the life its characteristic overall shape. On this reading, an E-ike zoe might well include G and H as well. What makes the life E-ike as opposed to G- ike, is that E is in some way its distinctive organizing principle; around E the other component activities are structured, or by E they are infused. G and H are done in an E-ish way, or according to E’’ (HF, p. 113). The good for us, in that case, must involve more than just the exercise of reason, as if we might as well be disembodied spirits. It must involve all of our vital functions, presumed now to be all ‘‘infused’’ or ‘‘structured’’ by reason. This much Nussbaum takes to show that Aristotle’s conception of the human essence incorporates the whole of human existence, not just one isolated function. This will enable Nussbaum later to produce the rich list of human functions and common features that I reproduced above. But having shown this much, Nussbaum still wants to show that Aristotle’s essentialism is internalist. To this end, she argues that the next step for Aristotle is to appeal to his audience’s own sense of what’s valu- able about their own lives, rather than to the objective method of finding the differentia, to support the claim that a life without reason, a mindless or hedonistic life, would not be a truly human life. Aristotle, she says, makes this appeal by trying to show that the valuing of reason is implicit in all human activities, so that one who tried to deny the centrality of reason would stand convicted of a kind of pragmatic inconsistency: such a skeptic would betray his own commitment to the value of human rea- son simply by his engaging in almost any of the activities of routine hu- man life, not to mention his willingness to enter into rational dispute. This means, then, that Aristotle does not depend on value-neutral, exter- nal facts to establish the nature of the good human life: The mindless life is not ruled out by external facts of nature; an- thropomorphs [beings who resemble but are not really human beings] might lead it consistently, though most of Aristotle’s op- ponents certainly do not lead it consistently with the rest of their values. . . . By participating at all in Aristotle’s inquiry about eudai- monia, an inquiry that explicitly announces that its results will be drawn from the active practical reasoning of each participant, the interlocutor grants implicitly the importance of practical reasoning in a human life. . . . But still . . . the mindless life is not ruled out; </page> <page sequence="22"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 29   # 22 Antony Natures and Norms 29 what is established is the cost of the choice, and how deeply it is at odds with some of our firmest convictions concerning who we are. (HF, p. 117) At the same time, Aristotle appeals to our common judgment about how to regard others who reject what we deem so centrally valuable: ‘‘The argument establishes, furthermore, that an anthropomorph who does lead the mindless life will not be regarded by us as fully human’’ (HF, p. 117). Now I certainly am not going to presume to enter into rational dis- putation with Martha Nussbaum about Aristotle exegesis, so let’s con- cede that she is right about what Aristotle is doing. What I want to point out is that the appeal to the audience’s own values—the move that made the account internalist rather than externalist—completely obviates the reference to human nature. And this has two consequences for Nuss- baum’s view. First, it means that for those purposes that Nussbaum was looking to a theory of human nature to provide some kind of relatively ‘‘hard constraints,’’ this internalist account is going to disappoint—we needed an external account for that. Second, it means that her argu- ment for why we ought to value the human functions on her list and should expect our societies to facilitate their exercise is, on its face, just as question-begging as Crittenden and Will’s. I’ll defend these points in turn. First, let’s recall the purposes for whichNussbaumarguedwe needed some form of essentialism. The first was to set some kind of hard con- straints on what counts as harm or damage to a human being. The pseudo-Aristotelian external account, as I said, looks reasonably promis- ing on this count. After all, one and the same kind of treatment can count as damaging or as perfectly reasonable, depending on the kind of thing that’s receiving it. Many things are destroyed by being banged on by a hammer, but banging on a nail doesn’t count as damaging it—nails are meant to be banged on; that is the only way that they can perform their proper functions. So it seems sensible to see what it is that human beings are meant to do and then to count as damage anything which destroys or reduces a human being’s capacity to do that. This argument does not work, of course, because of its equivocation on the notions of ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘good for.’’ A bomb is a good bomb if it explodes when and only when its owner wants it to—that much can be read off the bomb’s distinctive function. But we reason fallaciously if we continue in either of two ways: if we say that that’s a good bomb, good things are good, and, therefore, that’s a good bomb; or if we say that keeping a bomb in a dry, good place preserves its capacity to fulfill its function, that is, explode, and, therefore, that keeping it in a cool, dark place is good for the bomb. The first equivocates between the syncate- gorematic use of ‘‘good’’ in the construction ‘‘good X,’’ which means, </page> <page sequence="23"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 30   # 23 30 Ethics October 2000 roughly, ‘‘does what an X is supposed to do,’’ and the categorical ‘‘good’’ which carries an overall evaluative price tag, often a moral one. I happen to think that whether a bomb is good or bad in the categorical sense depends entirely on the reason it’s being deployed, and by this criterion, the vast majority of bombs are bad, and certainly no better, morally speaking, for performing their proper functions well. The second infer- ence equivocates between, again, the syncategorematic ‘‘good’’ and the sense of good that means something like well-being: fiber is ‘‘good for’’ us to eat, meaning that fiber contributes to our well-being. To be the sort of thing that has a well-being to consider, an object must be some kind of conscious agent; there is, accordingly, nothing that is ‘‘good for’’ a bomb in this sense. So we get the usual result. The externalist account can give us a plausible answer to questions about what, as a matter of fact, will be the consequences for a thing or a creature of this kind of doing X, Y, or Z, but it cannot tell us whether doing any of these things, even given those consequences, will be morally good, or good for the creature in question. But what about the internalist account? The internalist account bids us answer the question, What counts as damage? by consulting our own and others’ judgments about what we would find undesirable or intoler- able, moreover, what kinds of things, if removed from our own lives, would render them significantly less worth living. And while the inter- nalist account encourages us to express these judgments in terms of what is necessary to a human life, the fact that we are animals of this sort rather than another in fact puts no necessary constraints on the kinds of an- swers we can give. Williams, I take it, wanted an account that could say something like this: an essential feature of the human animal is that certain things— fire, sharp edges, percussive blasts, or strong acid—produce pain, an in- herently aversive experience, and, typically, damage, where damage can be cashed out in terms of the compromising of some evolutionarily de- termined function. Given that such liability to pain and damage is essen- tial to human beings, the avoidance of pain is not just something we learn to do in particular cultures— it’s built into us. It follows that every- one wants to avoid pain, and since everyone wants to avoid it, it is a prima facie bad thing to cause it to someone. But here, too, the crucial work is being done by the premise that says that everyone wants to avoid pain— it is that fact, if it is one, that generates the moral imperative. And given that everyone wants to avoid pain, it doesn’t matter much why everyone wants this. The fact that pain avoidance is instinctive, rather than acquired through acculturation, gives that disposition no special moral status. And on the other hand, the mere fact that some disinclination or dislike is socially induced does not give us moral leave to disregard it. Etiology is morally unimportant. </page> <page sequence="24"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 31   # 24 Antony Natures and Norms 31 Does this mean that neither an internalist nor an externalist ac- count can do the first job Nussbaum outlined? Well, yes. Neither kind of account can give us reason to regard some particular kind of treatment as morally wrong unless we antecedently grant a thoroughly normative premise about the value of the producing consequences of a given kind. And if we have that premise granted, we don’t need anything else. Does that mean that accounts of nature have no role to play in combating the kind of relativism that would make us immobile in the face of patent human suffering? No. We can still use the normatively neutral facts pro- vided by an externalist account; we can still use the strategy Nussbaum identifies as Aristotle’s for securing agreement about issues of value. I’ll explain what I mean by this presently. For now, let’s move on to consider the second job Nussbaum wants her essentialism to do. What can the internalist tell us about inauthentic desires or merely adaptive preferences? Can it give us grounds for saying that the widows’ expressed satisfaction with the state of their health should not be taken completely at face value? The internalist will have no difficulty in secur- ing my endorsement of the importance of a certain program of nutrition for leading the kind of life I consider to be a worthwhile one. But of course, that’s not really the issue here. Remember that the challenge in constructing a substantive theory of human nature for the purpose of making normative distinctions among people’s expressed desires was to avoid paternalistic or chauvinistic treatment of others and to respect other people’s autonomy, their right to determine for themselves what makes their own lives worth living. Crittenden, after all, is making a kind of internalist appeal to me by her effusive proclamation that ‘‘the most animating aspect of motherhood’’ is that ‘‘we love our children more than anything else and want to be with them as much as we possibly can.’’ 20 To which I say, what do you mean ‘‘we,’’ Danielle? Crittenden is inviting me to endorse her conception of a life worth living for a mother, but in doing so, she gives me no reason to do so. Nor is she giving me or anyone else—except someone who agrees with her about the crucial is- sue already—any reason to think that there’s anything wrong with the structure of preferences that I do have. But what is the basis of our (mine and Nussbaum’s anyway—I should let you, dear reader, speak for yourself) certainty that the widows who do not seem to mind being chronically undernourished are still be- ing cheated—and cheated, in some sense, by their own lights? Here, once again, an externalist account in conjunction with a certain kind of internalist appeal can offer some help. The externalist account of hu- man nature tells us mundane facts about how the human body is pro- grammed to operate. This will enable us to determine various prerequi- 20. See Will, quoting Danielle Crittenden,What Our Mothers Didn’t Tell Us: Why Hap- piness Eludes the Modern Woman (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999). </page> <page sequence="25"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 32   # 25 32 Ethics October 2000 sites for the functioning of various systems of the body. Now insofar as we can find anything that the widow does value that implicates one or more of these bodily systems, we have a point at which we might, with some justification, expect the widow’s stated preferences to change. (This is, after all, a great deal of what is involved in education—not the changing of fundamental values so much as the clarification of the results and prerequisites for pursuing the values we do have.) The externalist account, then, cannot generate for us the basis for making normative distinctions among values. But if such an account can be given at all— if it turns out that a good deal of the conditions of all human lives are set by facts about the kinds of creatures we are—then it can supply us with confidence that we can always find, with sufficient patience and humility, a point of entry for making an internalist appeal. Aristotle’s bet—that the commonalities of human life mean that all such lives are apt to have implicated the same set of human functions—can bolster our confidence that some consensus on the question of what sort of human life has value can be achieved. Things are looking up. But let’s turn to the last job, which is perhaps both the most vital of the three and the trickiest, and that is the task of determining the extent of the moral community. Let’s look first at how an externalist might have tried to approach this question. The idea would be that a scientific account of human nature would reveal a set of deep and explanatory properties shared by all human beings, in virtue of being members of the same species. Since these properties would in- clude properties that grounded the possession of a number of morally important properties, like the ability to communicate and affiliate with other members of the species or the ability to reason, we could conclude that membership in the moral community coincides with membership in the species Homo sapiens. In a sense, we would be demonstrating a convergence between the explanatory nature of a biological kind and the definitional nature of a socially constructed kind. But of course, once more, the externalist account is not going to be able to deliver just what it promises. In the first place, it’s quite clear that we need the explicitly normative judgment about what properties are morally valuable in order to derive anything about the normative com- munity from natural facts about human commonalities. Indeed, the con- vergence depends entirely on our defining the ethical kind, ‘‘person,’’ in the right way. Just as the critics warned, there is serious danger of prejudicial application of this term: if we put the wrong properties on this list—that is, if we select properties that turn out not to be common to all human beings—then we will not get the desired result. Nussbaum, however, thinks that her internalist account can do bet- ter. Once again, she proposes to invoke the strategy she attributes to Ar- istotle— if I try to exclude some fellow human being frommymoral com- munity, confront me with this person in a situation in which we must </page> <page sequence="26"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 33   # 26 Antony Natures and Norms 33 interact as people and then convict me in my own behavior of recogniz- ing the humanness of the other. Nussbaum cites the research of Raul Hilberg on the behavior of Nazi functionaries toward Jews in support of the effectiveness of this strategy: ‘‘He argues that whenever circum- stances arose that made it possible [sic—should surely be ‘impossible’] to sustain this denial [that Jews were not human], what ensued was an emotional ‘breakthrough.’ . . . [These were] times, above all, when it became impossible to avoid the fact that one was interacting with a Jew- ish prisoner in a human manner: occasions of personal conversation or emotional connection that eluded the watchful protective mechanisms of denial’’ (HF, p. 226). Because the salient humanness of these inter- actions stems from our common constitutions, concerns, and—at the relevant level of abstraction—circumstances, Nussbaum argues that the notion of ‘‘humanity’’ provides certain kinds of safeguards against preju- dicial application that are not provided, or not provided as well by more purely normative notions like ‘‘person’’: Any moral conception may be withheld, out of ambition or hatred or shame. But the conception of the human being seems so much more difficult to withhold than other conceptions that have been put forward as the basis for ethical obligation. The notion of the ‘‘person,’’ for example, has sometimes been preferred to the no- tion of the human being as a basis for ethics, on the grounds that it is clearly a normative conception. . . . I have argued that the conception of the human being is itself, in a certain way, a norma- tive conception, in that it involves singling out certain functions as more basic than others. . . . On the other hand, we have far less flexibility in the application of the concept than we do with ‘‘per- son.’’ (HF, pp. 226–27) Nussbaum goes on to explain that the content of the notion ‘‘person,’’ because it is a purely normative construction, does not seem to be con- strained by anything other than common custom or legal precedent, whereas application of the term ‘human being’ is governed by functional criteria like the abilities to sense, to communicate, to form attachments to other human beings, and so on; such functions cannot plausibly be denied to people on the basis of whim or prejudice. But Nussbaum is here being very slippery about what kind of con- cept of humanity provides advantages in this regard over a purely nor- mative conception. As I pointed out above, the external account needs the normative notion ‘‘person’’ in order to obtain any normative conse- quences about the extent of the moral community. And this notion has just the kind of ungroundedness and lability that Nussbaum finds dan- gerous. But how is Nussbaum’s internalist conception an improvement? It is normative, which means that its content is not fully determined by nonnormative facts about human beings. Nonetheless, Nussbaum </page> <page sequence="27"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 34   # 27 34 Ethics October 2000 thinks that the notion’s being linked to a biological category gives some purchase. But this is a mistake. Nussbaum presupposes a link between the cate- gory constructed by asking me what I value most deeply about my life and the biological category that will classify me together with many oth- ers whether I want to be so classified or not. But it is the link itself that needs explaining. Nussbaum has the internalist press her interlocutor with the question, ‘‘What makes your life a human life, a life worth living for a human being?’’ But the question could just as well be, ‘‘What makes your life important to you, what makes it a life worth living for someone like you?’’ As the term ‘humanity’ functions in the context of an inter- nalist theory, it is either an empty honorific, used to indicate especially important or valuable aspects of our lives as we see it, or it’s not. If it’s an empty honorific, then the question is harmless, but the answer will in no way connect me to others with whom I happen to be biologically related. If the term is meant instead in its nonnormative, biological sense, then I might rightly bridle at the question, for it presupposes that my answer will cite things that are common to all human beings, and I may happen to think that different kinds of lives are appropriate or desirable for dif- ferent kinds of human beings. Again, we can see the difficulty more clearly if we compare the analogous conception of flourishing that seems implicit in Crittenden and Will’s argument. Quoting Crittenden, Will asserts that ‘‘men and women, by the very nature of their biology, have different and often op- posing sexual agendas.’’ This means, in their view, that women should not try to lead the same kinds of lives as men but should instead ‘‘ ‘de- velop an appreciation for the mutual, if differing, contributions we make to marriage as man and woman,’ and for the different compromises aris- ing from sexual differences, especially compromises involving careers.’’ 21 For Crittenden and Will, the existence of human commonalities is nei- ther here nor there; in their view, the right question to ask is not, ‘‘What about your life makes it a truly human life?’’ but, rather, ‘‘What about your life makes it a truly feminine, or a truly masculine life?’’ Actually, the Crittenden and Will argument makes vivid the conse- quences for normative theory of one aspect of the account of natures that I mentioned above, and that is the problem about the relative on- tological priority of individuals and species. I said that, on the (external- ist) account of natures that I offered, a species essence can be no more than a generalization over the genotypes of individual members of the species. But of course, the character of the generalization will be a func- tion of the individuals chosen to generalize over. There will be nothing in nature that says that we must classify male humans together with fe- male humans, black humans with white humans, or English-speaking hu- 21. Will. </page> <page sequence="28"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 35   # 28 Antony Natures and Norms 35 mans with Swahili-speaking humans—nothing, that is, beyond the fact that some groupings will enable us to capture many more useful gener- alizations than will others. There is, furthermore, no natural level of ab- straction at which to cease generalizing. We could stop well before the level of species; we could go on much further. (And of course, many animal-rights advocates argue that an ethical theory that stops at the level of theory is ‘‘speciesist.’’) Again, all nature can tell us is where we’ll get the generalizations—the rest is up to us. What this means, too, is that there is no ‘‘natural’’ sortal in terms of which I am in any way constrained to identify myself. Because nature does not tell us which groupings we ought to concern ourselves with, it won’t divide properties for us into ‘‘essential’’ and ‘‘accidental.’’ This, too, appears to be very largely up to us. Is my sex essential to me or acci- dental? If I feel that it’s essential, does that mean that my moral com- munity ought to be drawn differently than if I think that it isn’t? So Nussbaum’s internalist conception of humanity is either just the externalist conception in disguise, in which case its presence simply begs the crucial normative question, or it’s genuinely internal, in which case it provides no constraints at all on its application. Where does this all leave us? Actually, we (would-be liberals) are not as badly off as it may appear. Neither the externalist accounts Nussbaum criticizes nor the internalist account she promotes can do quite the work we wanted from a theory of human nature. But as I suggested above, we can still deploy both sorts of accounts in useful ways. The externalist ac- count can tell us two kinds of things that will be relevant to ethical think- ing: the first is that we can indeed expect lots and lots of similarity among human beings. And insofar as we determine that the really valuable things (however we manage to do this) are properties connected to the sorts of capacities Nussbaum lists in the ‘‘Thick Vague Conception,’’ we can have confidence that nearly all of our conspecifics (by purely bio- logical criteria) will possess them. Second, it might also tell us that, given the way our embodiment works, we are extremely apt to have a variety of fundamental wants and needs in common. We are all going to find that pain hurts; although many of us, on many occasions, will choose to en- dure pain for the sake of something more valuable than the mere ab- sence of discomfort, it will be overwhelmingly likely that other things equal, we’d rather not have the pain. Knowing that much, we can learn to look for that more valuable thing in situations in which some human being is clearly suffering and, in so inquiring, perhaps conceive a way for that person to preserve the value without having to endure the pain. From the internalist account we get a guide for the process of ethical engagement. The strategy that Nussbaum finds in Aristotle (I have to confess at this point that I’m inclined to give Nussbaum more credit for this than she gives herself) is a strategy that bids us always find a basis, for any value that we recommend to another, in that other person’s own </page> <page sequence="29"> Name /C1469/C1469_CH01     10/24/00 06:31AM     Plate # 0-Composite pg 36   # 29 36 Ethics October 2000 current commitments and values. It also requires that we engage with others as members of a moral community. The question, ‘‘What do we value?’’ must be asked, not with the imperiousness of the person who knows, on the basis of his or her own answer, the answer that you too ought to accept but, rather, with a sense of identification and a presump- tion of common purpose. The facts provided by the externalist account and the strategy pro- vided by the internalist account work together. It is a great good thing that each one of us complicated, intelligent, striving, discouraged, hope- ful, hurting, and celebrating creatures has so much in common with all the others. Moral community might not be impossible without powerful resemblances to facilitate our knowing and identifying with each other, but it would be vastly more difficult. The very happy fact is that our commonalities make it— if not easy, at least something well within our grasp—to figure out what we ought to do with respect to each other. All that’s left is to do it. </page> </plain_text>
