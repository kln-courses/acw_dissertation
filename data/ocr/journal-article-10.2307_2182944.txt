<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS THERE A WORLD OF ORDINARY LANGUAGE? H AVING recently spent seven months on the Continent of Europe and having conversed with philosophers in five different countries there, I was surprised to find, under wide diversities and sharp disagreements, a well-marked current moving in a single direction. Apart from members of traditional schools, the living thinkers of Western Europe are basically concerned with the human life-world, or Lebenswelt, as Husserl called it in his last published work, Die Krisis der Europdischen Wissenschaften. I am not suggesting that most European thinkers are now committed to any of the special methods and doctrines which Husserl defended at different stages of his long and con- stantly self-critical career. This is not true. Nevertheless his concern to achieve an accurate description of the concrete phenomena of the Lebenswelt, as they are experienced and expressed in ordinary language, is a constant theme of all his writings. And in this broad sense the influence of phenomenology has spread far and wide. There are no doubt other sources for this contemporary interest in the Lebenswelt. But Husserl is perhaps the focal center of this new empiricism and his influence the most widely recognized. By world Husserl meant not a thing, not any set of objects, but rather an ultimate horizon within which all such objects and the individual person himself are actually understood in the "natural attitude" of everyday life. This horizon of concrete experience is sharply contrasted with the objective horizons of 'science which attend exclusively to objects via perspectives that are partial and abstract. As over against these, the world horizon of human life is concrete, subjective, and relative to man. This analysis has now been very generally accepted, and most European philosophers would agree that the task of describing the phenomena of this life-world and of analyzing its structure is of primary importance for philosophy. The scientist, like the rest of us, lives and moves within this world, and in a sense it is presupposed in his investiga- 460</page><page sequence="2">ORDINARY LANGUAGE tions. But we cannot expect him to perform the task of analysis, since he is interested in special, abstract objects of his own. Furthermore we must also recognize that, since the time of Plato, philosophers have disregarded the Lebenswelt as a subjective region of shadowy confusion and have turned their attention rather to transcendent objects and problems. On the Continent there is now a widespread skepticism con- cerning such objects and problems, and a widespread recognition of the need for a more radical empiricism now generally referred to as phenomenology. The aim of this discipline is to describe the phenomena of everyday life as they are lived in the horizon of the Lebenswelt, and the foreign visitor is struck at once by the many philosophical studies of such concrete phenomena as laughter and tears, imagination, sorrow, the feeling of guilt, personal encounter, and so forth. In these studies abstract terms and technical language are avoided, for it is recognized that the many shades of meaning and the very ambiguities of ordinary language are themselves significant and much closer to the con- crete. Each abstract horizon of science has its own special mode of abstract speech. But to deal with the inexhaustibly open and ever-changing phenomena of the Lebenswelt, a richer, more flexible, and more far-ranging mode of expression is required. What we call "ordinary language" develops and lives in the Lebenswelt. Hence this radical empiricism has brought forth a deep and widespread interest in the modes and structures of common speech. This is of course only a brief sketch but, I believe, a true characterization of what is going on now on the Continent of Europe. After returning to this country via England and Oxford, I was deeply impressed by certain apparent similarities between the living philosophy of the Continent and the linguistic analysis which is now proceeding so widely and so intensively in the Anglo-Saxon countries. Here too I noted a similar distrust of transcendent, unobservable objects, and of the artificial problems engendered by such assumptions. One also finds a similar urge towards empiricism, a respect for what is called fact, and finally a similar recognition of the depth and fertility of that ordinary language which is presupposed in all the artificial constructions 46i</page><page sequence="3">JOHN WILD and abstract modes of speech which grow out of it. These similar- ities led me to reflect on the mistrust and suspicion which is so openly expressed on both sides of the English Channel, and to wonder if this is not somehow based on avoidable misunder- standings and misconceptions. Is not the ordinary language of daily life correlated with the ordinary phenomena of the life- world? Is it not true that the careful study of the one must require the careful study of the other? Are not phenomenology (in the current broad sense) and linguistic analysis both approaching the same thing (concrete experience) from different angles? Are they then not so much severely opposed as mutually supplementary and fructifying? I think that these questions need to be asked and that an affirmative answer is possible. But before an affirmative answer can be given, certain difficulties must be cleared away. There are, of course, evident differences between these two movements of thought. Perhaps the most basic of these is a tendency on the part of analytic philosophers to identify the world of everyday experience with the objective universe, or the facts revealed by different sciences, and thus to follow our tradition in slurring over the concrete and humanly relative phenomena of the Lebenswelt with which ordinary language is primarily concerned. In this paper I shall first of all (I) give a concrete illustration of this failure to distinguish between what we may call abstract facts of science and concrete phenomena of the Lebenswelt; second (II) clarify and defend this distinction; third (III) offer some criticisms of two recent attempts to avoid it; and finally (IV) raise a question for analytic philosophers concerning the need for a distinctive kind of empirical analysis which philosophers alone can perform. I. A REDUCTION OF FACT TO SCIENTIFIC FACT The above tendency to merge all facts together under a scientific rubric is at present very widespread in England and America owing to the prestige of science and might be illustrated from many different works. I shall choose a recent essay by G. J. 462</page><page sequence="4">ORDINARY LANGUAGE Warnock entitled "Analysis and Imagination," in the volume Revolution in Philosophy.' Warnock is considering the different tasks which he believes need to be performed by philosophical analysis. The first is to exercise a therapeutic function in revealing "the distorted character" of certain general philosophical questions (p. I I4) and "breaking down the cramping rigidities which generate some philosophical difficulties" (ibid.). No radical empiricist could possibly disagree with this recommendation, especially as the author points out that the only remedy for such misguided questions "is to put our concepts back to work again in actual examples, to observe how in concrete cases they do actually function" (p. I I4). Next Warnock turns to "the 'systematic' work of analytic philosophy" which is to "examine language in the spirit of pure research, describing and ordering its features (p. II5). The phenomenologist can only applaud this aim. After this, the "explanatory task of analysis" is considered. It is possible for the analyst to ask, "Why do we use language in this way?" (p. II7). Why, for example, do we use the concept of cause as we do? In order to answer such questions, Warnock again recommends a procedure that is thoroughly empirical and phenomenological. "To explain our concept of causation," he says, "we need to trace its connections not only with other concepts that we employ, but also with empirical facts about the course of events in the world and the ways in which we concern ourselves with these events" (p. i i8). In this passage he seems to be speaking not merely about the objective facts of an abstract scientific horizon, but concrete facts in the life-world with which we ourselves are concerned. Finally Warnock turns to the "inventive" function of analysis. How can the analytic philosopher be original? We think at once of the array of divergent systems, and as soon as metaphysics enters into the picture, everything changes. The idea that philos- ophy has any empirical function to exercise fades away. The world of fact is the same for all of us. There are no philosophic problems here. A past metaphysician like Berkeley "saw the same 1 New York, 1957, pp. I I i-i26. 463 3</page><page sequence="5">JOHN WILD world that the rest of us see, but saw it from a rather different angle" (p. 122). He may have invented a new "conceptual appa- ratus," but in claiming that he was "discovering something real" (ibid.) he was wholly mistaken. Real facts are the province of science. In this respect the logical positivists were quite correct. "It was precisely by making these claims, by presenting themselves as super-scientists, discoverers par excellence that metaphysicians drew on their own heads the formidable bludgeon of Logical Positivism" (ibid.). In claiming any access to facts of any sort not thoroughly covered by some science, philosophy sets itself "on quite the wrong ground, ground from which it is liable to be destructively expelled" (p. I23). After some reflection on these passages the reader is led to ask, does philosophy exercise any factual function or does it not? Warnock seems to give a divided answer, and this ambiguity, I believe, is significant. In dealing with the therapeutic and systematic functions of philosophy, he recognizes that the analyst is not concerned with concepts alone but also with certain facts, recalling our attention to "the concrete and the familiar" (p. I I5). Now science may begin with the concrete and the familiar but it does not end there. Indeed, to be in this condition is precisely the sign of imperfection and immaturity. Each science tries to move away from this as soon as possible to the abstract and the unfamiliar. To dwell on these familiar facts of concrete experience in the attempt to analyze them accurately and interpret them is not the function of science. If it is to be performed at all, it is the function of philosophy. If there are such philosophic facts, or world facts, as we may call them, not "covered" by any special science, then it is false to assert that philosophy is exclusively concerned with language alone or with our "conceptual apparatus." But then a few pages further on, after suggesting something of this kind, Warnock ridicules the whole idea that philosophers (now called metaphysicians) might be "discoverers" (p. I22), and asserts that any claim to factual evidence will bring them onto ground from which they are "liable to be destructively expelled," especially by Logical Positivists. This, I believe, is a confusion, to which I desire to call the reader's attention. It is in essence the failure to recognize an 464</page><page sequence="6">ORDINARr LANGUAGE important ambiguity in the English word fact, which refers not only to scientific facts such as that the boiling point of water at normal atmospheric pressure is ioo0 C, but also to worldfacts, as I shall call them, such as that this yellow pencil is now on the table at my right. I shall maintain that these two senses of the same wordfact are quite distinct, and that our constant tendency to reduce the second to the first leads to basic confusions con- cerning the nature of philosophy. I believe that this reduction of fact to scientific fact is found not only in the thought of analysts, but also in that of many other philosophers at the present time. I have chosen Warnock's essay simply as a fairly typical example of a tendency that is now widespread in English and American philosophy. Indeed this tendency is firmly grounded in a traditional distrust of the con- fused and transitory data of immediate experience which goes back to the first origins of rational thought in the West. But I am not concerned here with this historical background. I am in- terested only in showing that there is an order of world fact which is bound up with ordinary language, and which is quite distinct from the different ranges and levels of scientific fact. I shall not try to present any coherent theory of what this order is, though theories of this sort have been presented. Many of them contain features that are both sound and suggestive, but all of them are as yet very incomplete and open to serious question at crucial points. I shall be content to suggest a few characteristic marks which I believe, in the light of ordinary language, are sufficient to justify this distinction between two kinds of fact. II. WORLD FACTS VERSUS SCIENTIFIC FACTS World is a term of ordinary discourse referring to an ultimate horizon embracing all lesser areas and regions of human activity, together with the things and persons in these regions. Thus we speak with a certain qualification of the world of finance, the world of the theater, and even of the world of science, referring in an inclusive sense not merely to the theories or objects of research but to the institutions, laboratories, and activities of scientists 465</page><page sequence="7">JOHN WILD as well. The world is that ultimate horizon which includes them all. When we wish to express the most far-ranging doubt concern- ing the location of anything in any region, we say, where in the world will you find it? This last horizon includes not only spaces and places but things, persons, activities, and kinds of act. Hence when we seek to express the most far-reaching doubt concerning any of these categories we use similar expressions, saying, what in the world is this thing? who in the world will do this for you? how in the world can this be done? and what in the world are you going to do? This world horizon encompasses all that we can know by feeling, thought, imagination, and any natural power. Hence to speak of another world, or of what lies beyond this world, is to refer to what transcends our experience in the widest sense of this word. The world is the last limit of what we can feel, or know, or contact in any way. It is not a thing or any collection of things or persons, for of them it would always be appropriate to say that it, or he, or they are in the world. Thus my friend and I are in the world together. The tools in a shop are in a certain working region of the world, as are mountain ranges and continents and even stars-if spoken of concretely and not abstractly as examples of general principles or laws. We refer to Newton's law of gravitation as a law of physics, not as a law of the world nor even as a being in the world, for it is too abstract to have any being of its own. But regarded more concretely as a phase of seventeenth-century science, it certainly belongs to world history. Things, persons, and even abstractions, when considered con- cretely as parts of wider contexts to which they belong, are all in the world. Indeed, we may say that this world background is part of what we mean by a thing or a person, for if I hear someone speaking of something not in this world and question him as to his meaning, it soon becomes clear that he is referring to what is transcendent and therefore no longer a thing. All concrete entities that are actual, or even conceivable, must be envisaged in a world context. Thus the novelist, in creating the persons of his story, must also create a world to go with them. Actual things, collections, and even fictions, when considered concretely together with those who construct and sustain them, 466</page><page sequence="8">ORDINART LANGUAGE are all in the world. But of the world itself we do not say that it is in the world, or indeed that it is in anything. It is not a thing but a horizon, the last limiting horizon of human experience and ordinary language. Let us now turn to a second basic difference which we have already suggested but which requires some further elaboration. This is the difference between abstract and concrete. Science certainly begins with individual world facts. But as we have pointed out, it moves as rapidly as possible to various abstract levels where it can formulate certain hypothetical laws of the type, if A then B. As is well known, these laws do not attempt to describe the actual course of concrete events. They state rather what will happen in general under certain specified conditions. Thus, disregarding atmospheric resistance, a body will fall at such and such a rate, or at a certain pressure water will boil at such and such a temperature. These abstract generalizations are the facts of science. When a science has arrived at maturity, concrete occurrences come into the picture only in so far as they exemplify or conflict with such generalizations. The movement is away from the concrete toward the abstract. Let us now turn to a world fact such as, This yellow pencil is now on the table at my right. The pencil is now here before me as I face the world. Such facts as these are at least as certainly known and as well confirmed by critical observation and intersubjective testing as any scientific facts. But two differences need to be noted. General terms, of course, like pencil, yellow, and table, have to be used. Otherwise the fact would remain ineffable. But the fact is individual and concrete, as is indicated by the demonstrative words this and my. The universal terms are used not to express a universal connection, but to illumine an individual situation here and now which must constantly be recognized and held in mind, if this fact is to be properly analyzed and understood. Here the movement is not only from the concrete to the abstract and universal, but also from the abstract and universal back again to the concrete which is always the center of attention. Such an entity, in its full concreteness, like this pencil, or I myself, is always envisaged in the world horizon, though this is often left unexpressed. Thus I do not normally think of myself as being 467</page><page sequence="9">JOHN WILD in the solar system, or even in the Milky Way, though these statements are technically true and acceptable in certain artificial contexts. But the whole of my concrete being, to which I refer by the first person pronoun, is too rich and variegated to be included within such abstract horizons. So I say rather of myself in a concrete context that I am in the world. In the second place, while a world fact may be illumined by universal terms and by hypothetical judgments involving special movements and conditions (if I looked at it from below, it would still look yellow), it does not itself necessarily involve such special conditions or abstractions. It is simply a concrete fact that has now emerged in world history. Of course one can analyze out certain conditions, like normal light, that do in fact hold. But these conditions hold after the fact, and in it, not before. The fact is not dependent on adopting a certain abstraction, or making certain arrangements. It is simply there before me in the world. Hence it is to be described in a categorical, not in a hypothetical or universal, mode. These two further differences must be noted. The facts of science are abstract and partially dependent on special modes of approach and observation. World facts are concrete and independent of any special mode of approach. A third basic difference, clearly noted by Husserl, is that the various fields and regions of science are purely objective, and consciously removed from what is called the subjective, as something incidental and capricious. To observe something scientifically means to gain an attitude of impartial detachment and to regard it as an object that is simply there before the mind. Whatever cannot be regarded in this way is dismissed as capricious and subjective. Nonliving things cannot be examined in any other way, and probably not too much is lost in such an analysis. Every phase of human existence also can be regarded from the outside, even human thinking and action once it is finished, in its deposits and results. But something is missed by such an objective proce- dure. This is the act as it is proceeding, as lived and experienced from within. Thus it has now been shown that it is one thing to analyze the finished results of language from the standpoint of an external observer, and quite another to analyze it as 468</page><page sequence="10">ORDINARY LANGUAGE it actually proceeds from the point of view of the living speaker.2 These inner factors of lived experience may be ignored as subjective by the detached attitude which is normal for science, but they are nevertheless important to living men, and play an essential role in the world horizon, which, as Husserl said, is relative to man and subjective. This is certainly true in spite of the vast range of this world horizon. Thus it is clear that the organs of the human body map out a world pattern, and that the human infant, from the time of birth and before, is open to a world that answers positively or negatively to its needs. It is no wonder, then, that we speak of the human world in contrast to the life-fields of other animals with different organs and needs. We go even further than this, and speak of my world, and of the world of a given individual, x ory, whose pattern is quite different. Such subjective factors have no place in the objective perspectives of science. Hence we do not speak of my galaxy, nor of the Hindu solar system. It is perfectly natural, however, to speak of the Hindu world, for this horizon of concrete facts involves not only objects but also subjective factors which are normally omitted by science. That this is no mere accident of speech we can show by a brief analysis of the world fact we have chosen: this yellow pencil now on the table at my right. Physical space does not lie around a vital center and is not oriented with respect to vital directions. Hence while the physicist may have to employ the notions of right and left in manipulating the instruments of his experiment, they have no place in the finished products of his analysis. But the space of the world is an oriented space, and we would at once lose our bearings if we could not distinguish in it the vital directions of right and left. Not only is this true but the notion of the pencil being on the table refers to a subjective orientation that is wholly absent from physical space. It involves a category of above and below which is derived from the relation of my body to external objects, which cannot be conveyed by any purely geometric or physical analysis. No matter how detailed such an analysis might be, unless it 2 Cf. F. de Saussure, Cours de linguistique generate (Lausanne, i9i6). 469</page><page sequence="11">J OHN WILD surreptitiously introduced "anthropomorphic" factors, I could not tell from it alone which of the extended objects was above or below, or whether they were merely side by side.3 The objectivist will no doubt wish to say that this is merely the introduction of a distorted and biased version of physical space. But this is also to express a bias. Without begging many questions it will perhaps be fairer to say, in the light of what is now known, that world space contains many human factors which are absent from any pure geometric or physical space. This should not be understood as implying that world space, or the world, is merely subjective in the usual sense of this confusing word. If we turn to ordinary language for guidance, we find it hard to imagine any situation in which it would be reasonable to say that space is in me, or the extended things outside of me are in me, or the world is in my head. The relativity of which we have been speaking makes no demand on us to accept any such absurdities. Neither does it necessarily imply that our experience is a distorted version of things as they are in themselves. It does require that the things we know are in relation to us. But there is no reason for doubting that these relations are quite real, that we can know them at least in part as they are, and that by abstracting from these relations, science can give us some knowledge of what things are apart from them. The beings around us are quite independent. But we understand them and order them in a world horizon which is relative to us. This is a digression, however. The point we are concerned to make is that this relative world horizon is different from the more abstract perspectives of science, and that world facts, therefore, include relative factors which are absent from what we may call normal scientific facts. What are these relative factors? I shall not attempt to draw up an exhaustive list but now, as a fourth point, will make a few comments on one of the most important of these, namely value. These phenomena can, of course, be regarded from a detached point of view as value facts. In this way they can be embraced 3 M. Merleau-Ponty, Phe'nome'nologie de la perception (Paris, 1945), pp. II7- i i8. 470</page><page sequence="12">ORDINARY LANGUAGE within a scientific or objective framework. We can observe that such and such a person A has a desire for B, and that such and such a culture Y has a dislike for Z. But objective facts of this sort are quite different from values as they are directly experienced in the Lebenswelt and expressed in ordinary language. Hence the statement that science is neutral to value conveys a certain truth which needs to be spelled out. We shall take the time now briefly to note three differences. First, we have inherited from our tradition a strong tendency to think of things as substances which are prior to their relations (including value relations)-a certain kind of accident. A thing must first be what it is before it can have a value. Thus for the objective analyst, the pencil is first of all an extended substance with a certain shape and point, a certain color, and so forth, which may be used for writing. Value predicates are later additions that things come to have in relation to human desire. In the Lebenswelt, however, values are original and lie at the very core of things. Thus in ordinary conversation we would never refer to the object at my right as a thing with certain- properties adapting it to writing. We refer to it straight off as a pencil, which is not a neutral noun but a value term. This is not only true of artificial objects but of natural objects as well, like sunshine, storm, and fire. In the life-world, these objects are originally loaded with value meanings. To lose sight of these meanings is to fall into complete disorientation. In the Lebenswelt value is not a later addition. It is constitutive of the thing. Second, the realistic tradition has led us to make a similar analysis of the human agent or the human group. Good or evil desires and acts are later accidents which the agent may or may not "have." But the living agent is not separated from his acts in this way. He is a set of desires and aspirations. A human culture is not a neutral structure with approvals and disapprovals added on. It is a structure of approvals and disapprovals. To be commit- ted to a value is very different from observing this from outside. When I actually hold to a value, it becomes essential to me and affects my whole existence from the ground up. Thus in ordinary, moral discourse, as distinct from detached argumentation, we do not say that a friend of ours had courage on such an occasion. We 47I</page><page sequence="13">JOHN WILD say he was courageous. We do not speak of a person as developing attributes of slyness and greed. We say he is rapacious. Third, we have already touched on a point which needs to be developed further. This is a tendency commonly found in objective analysis to regard value as a special kind of property, or genus, or region separate from other regions. One example of this would be the traditional way of distinguishing between value and fact. More specific illustrations would be Hartmann's realm of value, and even G. E. Moore's conception of value as a very peculiar, simple, and unanalyzable property. It is difficult, however, to find concrete illustrations of this restrictive character when one turns to the life-world. Here what we refer to by the term "value" refuses to let itself be confined within any special compartment or region but seems rather to run through various regions, even getting itself involved in whatever it is that enables us to distin- guish between different regions, each of which is for some end. Thus the whole area of agriculture, farms, fields, storage plants, and slaughter houses is for food, that of medicine, sewers, food inspection, research laboratories, medical schools, and hospitals for health, and so on. In the light of these facts, it would seem to be hard to maintain that value is confined only to a single, special region of its own. It would seem rather to pervade the whole life-world. This pervasive character is reflected, as we should expect, in ordinary language where value is not expressed by any special words or forms but by all words and all forms, including the tone of voice. I believe that this is sufficient to show that there is an ultimate world horizon correlated with ordinary language which has certain features distinguishing it sharply from the objective horizons of traditional realistic thought and modern science. This world horizon is (i) concrete and (2) categorical. It also contains (3) certain "subjective" and relative factors, among the more important of which is (4) a pervasive "value" factor which cannot be understood (as it is) from the outside, but only as it is lived, so to speak, from the inside. As over against this, the horizons of realist philosophy and science are abstract and hypothetical. They also have no place for the lived experience of value and other experiences of this kind, whose pervasive 472</page><page sequence="14">ORDINARY LANGUAGE character they try to restrict, and which they neglect and dismiss as private and subjective. Hence I believe that the distinction between world facts and scientific facts is justified. World facts are in the former horizon, scientific facts in the latter. We have pointed out that the world horizon is characterized by a certain ultimacy, and that, for ordinary language, at least, what lies beyond the world possesses an unqualified transcendence which certainly does not seem to belong to any facts of science. We have also suggested not that every scientific fact, but that every type of scientific fact, can be found as an abstract aspect of some world fact. In the context of ordinary discourse we should certainly find the statement that science is out of this world as odd. These observations might seem to suggest that the various perspectives of science, or the perspective, if there is such a thing, should be regarded as an abstract horizon within the Lebenswelt. Such a view is, I think, defensible and certainly does not imply any traditional form of idealism. But it raises many basic issues which I have not touched upon. So I am not defending it or even considering it here. I am simply asserting that world facts belong to an independent world horizon quite distinct from the scientific universe, that this is the factual horizon or ordinary language, and that it deserves disciplined attention and study by philosophers. This is my thesis. III. Two WAYS OF REDUCING WORLD FACTS As we have pointed out, the central tradition of Western philosophy has been predominantly objectivist and has been marked throughout its history, ever since Plato, by a strong tendency to restrict and depreciate world facts as relative and distorted versions of reality, and finally to absorb them into a purely objective perspective. I have no time here to review all the manifold phases of this prolonged attempt to discredit ordinary language and its world. I shall single out two versions of this attempt now widely familiar for a brief concluding comment. One of these uses the distinction private versus public, the other that of subjective versus objective. Both distinctions are now commonly 473</page><page sequence="15">JOHN WILD employed as ways of restricting the world horizon of everyday speech to a very limited perspective which, in this reduced form, can be more readily fitted into the scientific universe-the last framework into which objectivist thought has crystallized. Those who make the former distinction arbitrarily cut off the human person from his world horizon and enclose him within a private world of his own. Since the sensory equipment of each individual is different from that of every other, we can understand why the sensations that arise in him must be different from their objective causes, and also different from those of another. Each individual lives in a private world of his own which he directly experiences within himself. These private worlds, though different in quality, vary in correlation with objective stimuli. Hence, if properly interpreted, they may be biologically useful and may justify the inferences of science. They appear with the human organism as a late phase of biological evolution and, as such, they may be fitted into the great public world of objects which includes them spatially as well as temporally and which is always the same for all observers. Just as the private dwellings of individ- uals are tiny parts of the public town, so the private worlds of individual organisms are tiny parts of the public universe of science. Both Russell and Broad have used the terms "public" and "private" in a reductive argument of this kind. Of this argument we need only note that while every experience arises from a private center, it always opens into a public world horizon from which it cannot be separated except by arbitrary abstraction. My world is never exclusively private. It is my private way of relating myself and my experiences to an ultimate horizon which is shared. In its very constitution it is a union of the private and the public and therefore has room within it for both. As a matter of fact, both factors are always found, as is clearly witnessed by ordinary language, for do we not only say that I myself, my body, my innermost thoughts and desires are in the world, but that the public streets, the fields, the mountains, and the stars are in the world as well? Both public and private are factually in the world. The distinction between subjective and objective has also been used to break down the integral structure of human existence in 474</page><page sequence="16">ORDINARY LANGUAGE the world and to discredit ordinary language for the sake of artificial constructions. Such attempts are subject to a similar criticism. Consciousness has a subjective center, but it is found to be always stretched out toward objects of some kind. These objects, and the way in which they are ordered, may differ from individual to individual and from culture to culture, but no self has ever been found in an objectless state. As a matter of fact, our experience is neither exclusively subjective nor exclusively objective but a relational structure to which neither term alone does justice. Concrete experience is private as well as public, subjective as well as objective. Neither can be separated from the other and reified without distorting the facts, for human existence is open to a world horizon. Man carries this "field" with him wherever he goes, and it is now clear that this is a necessary aspect of his existence. Without a world there can be no man, and without man there can be no world. Far from containing us within a special, mental region, it is precisely our lived subjectivity that opens us to an ultimate world horizon, and it is precisely this last objective horizon that requires a subjective center. In the light of these remarks, I shall now venture to suggest that the distinction of private versus public, and subjective versus objective, as they have been commonly used in traditional philosophy, are phases of an age-old effort to depreciate the world of lived experience as subjective and relative, and to discredit ordinary language as hopelessly vague and confused. IV. A FINAL QUESTION ADDRESSED TO ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHERS I began this paper by noting the present sharp separation of those phenomenological studies of the world of direct experience, which have had a revolutionary effect on the Continent of Europe, from the method of linguistic analysis which is now exerting a marked effect on Anglo-Saxon thought. In the light of the close correlation between ordinary language and the empirical world, this mutual separation and distrust seem strange, and I suggested that a study of the reasons for this mistrust of philosophy on the 475</page><page sequence="17">ORDINARr LANGUAGE Anglo-Saxon side as in any sense an empirical discipline might have something to do with the traditional tendency to disparage or at least to restrict the immediate data of experience as unstable and subjective. I then examined a recent account of analytic philosophy (I) and showed that it was characterized by a certain ambiguity in its use of the termfact which easily leads to a reduction of world fact to scientific fact, and to a denial that philosophy has any empirical function to perform. After this (II) I offered three kinds of evidence to show that there are cogent reasons for making the distinction between world facts and scientific facts, and chose two types of argument, based on the distinctions private versus public and subjective versus objective, which have recently been used to restrict and discredit immediate experience as purely private and subjective. I showed that these arguments are subject to certain criticisms, and that our subjective experience, far from being reducible to a set of impressions or inner sense data, actually opens up to a world horizon which is markedly distinct from the objective perspectives of science and traditional philos- ophy. In the light of these observations, I should now like to raise the following questions which, it seems to me, are important for analytic philosophers. Is it not true that ordinary language is concerned with facts of a different order from those of science? Is there not a world of ordinary language? Is it not likely that this world has a certain structure which is not the concern of any special science but is worthy of disciplined attention ? Such a study has been inaugurated on the Continent of Europe by the so-called phenomenologists. Is not such a study closely correlated with that of everyday discourse? Instead of being essentially opposed, are not these two approaches mutually supplementary and fructifying? In short, is there not a world of ordinary language and is not the disciplined study of this world of interest to the analytic philosopher? JOHN WILD Haivard University 476</page></plain_text>
