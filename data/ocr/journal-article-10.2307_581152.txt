<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 For Inessa Alessandra to mark her first year of life INTRODUCTION Continuity and change have characterized Sicilian archaeology during the quinquennium covered by this report. The chal- lenges it faces have remained unchanged (cf. AR 1995-96, 59), but one notices in this period a greater willingness to address them in a public forum. This trend is part of a larger dialogue in Italian archaeology as a whole, regarding method and theo- ry, institutional structures, and the protection of cultural her- itage, a trend which in turn parallels current archaeological developments elsewhere in the world - see most recently R. Skeates, Debating the Archaeological Heritage (London 2000). The incident of illegal building in Agrigento's Valley of the Temples mentioned in the previous report has been the springboard for larger lesson-learning in a recent book by G. Gucciardo, La legge e l'arbitrio: l'abusivismo edilizio in Italia: il caso della Valle dei Templi di Agrigento (Soveria Mannelli 1999). As G.P. Brogiolo, a leading Italian medieval archaeologist, has pointed out (Archeologia Medievale 24 [1997] 7-30), part of the problem surrounding illegal building lies in the bureaucratic nature of state-dominated Italian archaeology, conditions which hinder the quick passing of leg- islation to curtail it, but, as Brogiolo also notes, such delay can partly be explained by the immense increase in recent years of archaeological discoveries. Two other outcomes of this expo- nential growth have continued to plague Italian archaeology in this period: the shortage of trained archaeological personnel and the publication of finds. In Sicily, the lack of trained per- sonnel has been acutely felt in connection with, for instance, the Punic ship at Marsala and the recent discovery of the stat- ue of 'Aeolus' retrieved from the Sicilian Canal, which, after a brief stay in Mazara del Vallo, was sent to Rome for restoration (see below for further details). In the area of publication, the situation outlined in the previous Sicilian report has remained constant, but some steps have recently been taken to address the problem on an Italy-wide basis (La pubblicazione delle scoperte archeologiche in Italia: tavola rotonda (Roma, 11 dicembre 1997) [Atti dei convegni lincei vol. 144] [Rome 1998]). The illegal excavation and trade of antiquities is anoth- er commonly encountered problem, one that Italy is deter- mined to curb (cf. A.L. Slayman, Archaeology 51.3 [1998] 43-9). As a result two important conferences took place, their proceedings published in P. Pelagatti and M. Bell III (eds.), Antichitd senza provenienza I: atti della tavola rotonda, American Academy in Rome, 18febbraio 1995 [BdA suppl. to vols. 89-90 (1995 [1998])], and P. Pelagatti and P.G. Guzzo (eds.), Antichitd senza provenienza II: atti del colloquio inter- nazionale, 17-18 ottobre 1997 [BdA suppl. to vols. 101-102 (1997 [2000])]; Sicilian subject-matter appears often in these pages. None of these problems has a quick solution, but their recognition and discussion in an open and public manner is cer- tainly a positive new direction in bringing them under control. Other tendencies in Sicilian archaeology include the con- tinuing retreat from 'Hellenocentric' archaeology, with the ground left behind claimed by Sicily's native and Phoenicio- Punic populations (see below for more details). This is not a new phenomenon, but part of an ongoing process of maturation which is restoring balance to anc. Sicily's multiculturalism. It will doubtless continue, since it is evident not just in the ranks of younger scholars, where one would expect it, but also among older scholars occupying the highest offices in most institutions, and therefore most influential (cf., for instance, the self-reflexive comments of A. Di Vita in Atti Taranto XXXVII, 362). Medieval archaeology is another research area that con- tinues to develop by leaps and bounds all across Italy, necessi- tating the establishment in 1997 of a national forum, the 'Congresso Nazionale di Archeologia Medievale.' Two confer- ences under this banner have already taken place, and their pro- ceedings have been quickly and well published (cf. CNAM I-II). The proceedings of CNAM II have doubled in size since CNAM I three years before, and Sicilian representation at both conferences was strong. The growth of medieval archaeology in Sicily was also seen in 1997, when the first instalment of an international conference devoted to the archaeology of Byzantine Sicily was held in Corleone (the proceedings are being prepared for publication). The establishment of this kind of intellectual forum reflects the growing desire in the island, and in Italy as a whole, of giving scholarly due to this often neglected period of history. The Corleone conference, along with calls in this period (see below) for a more diversified approach to Byzantine archaeology (not new to the Anglo- American world: M.L. Rautman, Byzantinische Forschungen 15 [1990] 137-66), will no doubt do much to stimulate research. In general, it may be remarked that there is growing diversification in the questions and approaches to Sicily's archaeology, especially on the part of Sicilians, who naturally dominate research. In particular, such things as landscape archaeology and DNA studies readily come to mind (see below). We are on the verge of a potentially very exciting era in Sicilian archaeology. Sources of information for Sicilian archaeology have remained for the most part unchanged since the last report, although some important developments are worth noting. In respect of periodicals, Kokalos is still a prime outlet, not only because of its venerable status amongst Sicilian scholarly pub- lications, but also because it continues to publish the proceed- ings of the Palermo conferences on Sicilian antiquities. The latter still appear with the time-lag noted in the previous report (AR 1995-96, 60): the first two volumes of the 1997 proceed- ings appeared in 2000, and the remaining volume containing the reports of the various Superintendencies is still in progress as this report goes to press. Another of the standard periodicals, Sicilia Archeologica, has recently received a make-over: its editorship remains with the Azienda Provinciale Turismo di Trapani, but from volume xxxi.96 (1998 [2000]) onwards, publication has been in col- laboration with the well-known Rome publisher L'Erma di Bretschneider, which now produces and distributes it (making the volumes more accessible outside Sicily and encouraging a wider readership-welcome developments). The overall impression given by the three volumes published by L'Erma di Bretschneider is that they are less semi-popular, lengthier and glossier than before (and hence needless to say more expen- sive). Volumes xxxii.97 (1999 [2001]) and xxxiii.98 (2000 [2001]) of Sicilia Archeologica have just been published and their information will be included in the next report. The Beni Culturali e Ambientali, Sicilia has ceased publi- cation altogether; the last volume appeared as ns 34 (1993- 94). A similar fate seems to await the Quaderni dell'Istituto di Archeologia della Facoltd di Lettere e Filosofia dell'Universitd di Messina, the latest volume of which is 9 (1994 [1996]), and inside sources suspect that that may be it. There are also five new periodicals (three Sicilian and two Italian) to watch out for. Of the Sicilian ones, we may begin by noting that La Societa Ragusana di Storia Patria has had since 1995 its own publication, Archivio Storico Ibleo, pub- lished whenever there is enough material to fill a volume, as is the case with the periodicals of other Sicilian local historical societies. The first volume is dedicated to A. Di Vita, a distin-</page><page sequence="2">146 FRANCO DE ANGELIS guished archaeologist from the region, and contains contribu- tions by him and other scholars on the archaeology and histo- ry of the anc. Ragusano. The second new Sicilian periodical is Aitna. Quaderni di topografia antica, published by the University of Catania's Centro Universitario di Topografia Antica (CEUTA). This is also of irregular publication frequen- cy, and three volumes have appeared to date: 1 (1994); 2 (1996); 3 (1999). The last Sicilian newcomer is Fuorivista: storie e visioni dalla provincia. Started in 1999, this is a pop- ular magazine-type periodical, published three times a year, on the local history and culture of Agrigento province. The few issues that I have been able to consult contain material that refers mostly to people and events of more recent times, infor- mation which is nevertheless helpful in appreciating the broad- er cultural background of this important part of Sicily. In any case, the editorial in the first issue says nothing about Fuorivista having a restricted chronological focus, and so we might expect future issues to contain material that has more direct bearing on antiquity. The two new Italian periodicals made their first appearance in 1998. Minima Ephigraphica et Papyrologica is published by L'Erma di Bretschneider for the Cattedra e Laboratorio di Epigrafia e Papirologia Giuridica dell'Universita degli studi di Catanzaro, to mark the creation of this new University, formerly a branch of the University at Reggio Calabria. At least one volume appears per annum, although 2000 was something of a bumper year with two vol- umes. The other periodical, Mediterraneo Antico: Economie, Societi, Culture. Rivista Internazionale di Storia Antica, is a semi-annual out of Pisa, published by the Istituti Editoriali e Poligrafici Intemazionali. Both periodicals have the entire anc. Mediterranean basin as their focus, though some of the articles have already been dedicated specifically to Sicilian matters (see below). There are also developments to report in other regularly occurring publications. An excellent new monograph series has been established by the Palermo Superintendency. Each monograph has a standard three-part format: first, full-length publication of individual sites excavated by the Superintendency; second, the publication of collections of material; and third, briefer news bulletins of recent archaeo- logical activities in the Superintendency's jurisdiction. The first volume, by C. Greco, F. Spatafora, and S. Vassallo (eds.), Archeologia e territorio (Palermo 1997) is discussed fully below. Elsewhere the standard series continue to produce vol- umes. There are two additions (xiv-xv) to BTCGI: the first, published in 1996, covers the sites Pitigliano to Regalbuto (twenty-eight entries are Sicilian), and the second, published in 1999, contains the 1991-1995 general works by subject and author, as well as addenda to those published between 1977 and 1990. Three more volumes of Fasti Archaeologici 38-41 (1983-1986), containing the 'Annual Bulletin of Classical Archaeology', appeared in 1997. Although now irrecoverably about a decade behind in its coverage, the bulletin is still use- ful, providing brief annotations of the various publications arranged by site, region, subject-matter and period. Learned meetings and exhibitions also contribute greatly to the generation and dissemination of research, and their high frequency, both in Sicily and outside, has not changed since the last report (cf. AR 1995-96, 59-60). Details of many of these are given below, and the intention here is to outline the frame- work of such events and to discuss matters not otherwise dealt with. The learned meetings are of two kinds, regularly-occur- ring and single-occasion. Among the former, the Palermo con- ference on Sicilian antiquities noted above is the longest-run- ning such forum in the island. Each conference follows a stan- dard format, with most papers devoted to a particular theme (that of the IXth conference in 1997 was 'Ruolo mediterraneo della Sicilia nella tarda antichita'); the remaining papers give subject reviews and reports from the Superintendencies. In recent times, organization of more specialized regularly-occur- ring conferences has meant that the Palermo conferences are less comprehensive than they once were, but this is not neces- sarily a bad thing, since the development has been a stimulus to research. A case in point is the Elymian conference which happens every three years in Gibellina and other small towns in Western Sicily, with proceedings generally published around the time of the next conference (cf. Atti elimi II-III). After some difficulties, the annual conferences on Sicilian underwa- ter archaeology have resumed at Giardini Naxos (for brief summaries, see G. Boetto, IJNA 25 [1996] 153-4; E. Solinas, Archeologia Viva xv.58 [1996] 74-8; F. Cibecchini and P. Pruneti, Archeologia Viva xvii.70 [1998] 70-4; S. Bargagliotti and F. Cibecchini, Archeologia Viva xix.82 [2000] 72-3; S. Scarpa, Archeologia Viva xx.87 [2001] 84-5). The Giardini Naxos conferences now have a national equivalent organized by the recently created Associazione Italiana Archeologi Subacquei. The proceedings of its first conference, which included some Sicilian participants, recently appeared as Atti del convegno nazionale di archeologia subacquea (Anzio 1996) (Bari 1997) (reviewed by C. Beltrame, IJNA 27 [1998] 180-1). This is not the first time a national conference on underwater archaeology has been held in Italy (one was held in Rome in December 1989, and published in Bollettino di Archeologia Subacquea 2-3 [1995-96]; see below for the Sicilian papers), but certainly the first from this new initiative. Of the regularly occurring meetings held generally out- side Sicily or occasionally inside it, we may begin by noting that two more of the international congresses on Phoenicio- Punic studies have taken place: the IVth in Cadiz on October 2-6, 1995 and the Vth in Marsala/Palermo on October 2-8, 2000 (proceedings of both are being prepared for publica- tion). In association with the latter, a small exhibition, 'I Fenici delle isole/The Phoenicians of the Islands' showing in Castelvetrano and Erice, accompanied by a small and colour- ful guide, was to have run from October 8, 2000 to January 10, 2001, but has been extended by several months to the end of summer. Mention should also be made of another Phoenician exhibition shown in Cyprus, Italy, Malta and Tunisia, with a catalogue available in English, French, and Italian-the latter version appeared as E. Acquaro (ed.), Sulle rotte deifenici (Milan 1999). The Associazione Italiana per lo Studio e la Conservazione del Mosaico held its fourth meeting in Palermo in late 1996 (cf AISCOM IV), and as a result many of the contributions deal with Sicilian subject- matter (see below). One of the Cura aquarum conferences also took place in Sicily in 1998, and likewise Sicilian repre- sentation was stronger than usual (see below). Two of the recent Taranto conferences on Magna Graecia (Atti Taranto XXXIV and Atti Taranto XXXVII) also have much relevant Sicilian material in them, frequently cited below. The last conference that can be noted here is 'The Second International Roman Archaeology Conference' held at the University of Nottingham (April 11-13, 1997). The confer- ence, organized by R.J.A. Wilson, also incorporated 'TRAC '97' ('The Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference'). Numerous single-occasion meetings with Sicilian content have taken place during this quinquennium. The single largest group involved celebrations of the long careers of several well- known scholars (cf. Studi BBPC, Studi Di Vita, Studi Gullini, Studi Moscati, Studi Orlandini, Studi Pelagatti, and Hommage Vallet) and it might also be appropriate to mention here that thirty-seven of A. Di Vita's articles have been reprinted in a</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 147 single volume, Da Siracusa a Mozia: scritti di archeologia siciliana (Padua 1998). These volumes list the bibliography of each honorand, followed by articles by colleagues on topics related to his/her fields of scholarly interests (the articles rele- vant to Sicily are discussed below). Many more single meetings could be mentioned, but the remaining discussion focuses on the unpublished ones, in order to signal their presence to readers before the next Sicily report in five years' time. A day-long workshop on Central Mediterranean prehistory, organized by J. Robb and M. Pearce and sponsored by the Accordia Research Centre, took place at the University of London's Institute of Archaeology (November 13, 1999). Among the papers given were Sicilian contributions on obsidian and geoarchaeology. On historic Sicily, there are forthcoming proceedings of two conferences: 'Per servire alla storia di Gela' held in Gela (October 2-3, 1998), and 'La Sicilia dei due Dionsi' held in Agrigento (end of February 1999). A large international gathering entitled 'The Aegean and the Western Mediterranean: relations and interaction 8th-5th century BC' was held in Vienna (March 24-27, 1999); proceedings will shortly be available and papers on Sicily will be noted in the next report. Also nearing publi- cation are the proceedings (eds. C. Morgan and G.R. Tsetskhladze) of the conference 'Art and Myth in the Colonial World' held at Royal Holloway and Bedford New College in the University of London on April 20-23, 1997. Prof. B. Shefton's 80th birthday was appropriately marked with a con- ference on 'Greek Identity in the Western Mediterranean' (June 30-July 2, 1999) in Newcastle upon Tyne. The proceedings' editor (K. Lomas) has kindly informed me that the volume, soon to be published, will contain two Sicilian contributions (C. Antonaccio on ceramics and identity in SE Sicily and E. Zambon on tyrannies in HL Sicily) and a wealth of information on issues highly relevant to Sicily. Similar ammunition is pro- vided by another conference 'The Cultures within Greek Culture: contact, conflict, collaboration' held in Wellesley, MA (November 4, 2000). I have learned from its organizer, C. Dougherty (to whom I am most grateful), that there are plans to publish the proceedings, but on an as yet undefined timetable (in the meantime, for more information one can con- sult the conference website located at http://ccat.sas. upenn. edu/-josiah/wellesley. html). One final area of continuity and change needs to be addressed, and that is in regard to the preparation of this report. In January 1997, responsibility for its compilation changed hands. In so far as possible, I have attempted to maintain a level of coverage comparable to that provided by my prede- cessor, Prof R.J.A. Wilson (University of Nottingham). Nonetheless, like him (cf. AR 1995-96, 59), I have come to realize that, however hard one tries, comprehensive coverage is simply impossible owing to the difficulty of obtaining infor- mation and to the rigours of balancing a hectic university career of teaching, administration, and other research projects. In addition, a new AR compiler inevitably means that there will be differences of emphasis from preceding reports due not only to the availability of material, as just noted, but also to person- al interests and expertise. Under such circumstances, there- fore, it is simply impossible to give even treatment to all the relevant archaeological studies that have appeared in the peri- od under review. Nevertheless, for the benefit of readers, I have followed the practice of my predecessor in citing as much of the new bibliography as possible, and have been more sys- tematic in listing any reviews or commentaries known to me to give readers a fuller indication of the contents and merits of this bibliography. Readers should not conclude that works mentioned in passing are in any sense secondary-quite the contrary, for the reasons just stated. Following tradition, this report is divided into two main parts: the first deals with wider developments relevant to all or large parts of Sicily, and the second with the regional developments on a site-by-site basis. Acknowledegments. I am most grateful to certain indi- viduals and institutions for material and various kinds of sup- port without which these reports could not have been possible. To the following I extend my heartfelt thanks: R.M. Albanese Procelli (Catania), C.M. Antonaccio (Middletown, CT), the late D. Asheri (Jerusalem), W. Aufrecht (Lethbridge, AB), M. Becker (West Chester, PA), M. Bell III (Charlottesville, VA), D.J. Blackman (Athens), M. Biirge (Zurich), Casalini Libri (Fiesole), G. Castellana (Agrigento), J.-P. Crielaard (Amsterdam), M.E.

Travel and research funds which allowed me to collect additional materi- al in various Canadian and European libraries have been pro- vided over the years by the Universities of Calgary and Lethbridge. In addition, material was provided through the Inter-Library Loans Service of my past and present home institutions. For all this institutional support, I am most grate- ful. Last but far from least, two special acknowledgements must be made. I would like to extend my warmest thanks to R.J.A. Wilson, the previous compiler of these reports, for being a constant source of support and encouragement throughout their preparation. Ever since we were introduced just under a decade ago in Oxford, I have been amazed by his high academic standards and his great love for Sicily. These have served as my inspirational models. The final and most important daily debt of gratitude is owed to my dear wife, T.C. Connolly, who has endured patiently the stubborn tenacity I have clung to in preparing these reports during the past four years, and particularly during the last one, when our lives have been enriched by the addition of a new family member. I am truly fortunate that she, too, is a great believer in the advance- ment and dissemination of knowledge. Abbreviations in addition to the standard ones given on the inside front cover of this volume are to be found at the end of this article. GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS Discussion here is divided into thematic sections, which are not to be regarded as self-contained units that overlap little with others elsewhere in this report. Most of these sections fol- low a chronological and cultural order, with the exception of the first two which contain more general material relevant to all or large parts of Sicily. History of scholarship. It is with great regret that I report on the passing away of several notable archaeologists and his- torians. Sorely missed will be R. Martin, S. Moscati, P.E. Arias,</page><page sequence="4">148 FRANCO DE ANGELIS L. Bemab6 Brea, D. Asheri, and G. Nenci. These losses have received attention in the local presses; more accessible to read- ers, however, will be the accounts of the life and legacy of these individuals in learned journals. On Martin: C. Rolley, RA (1997) 129-30. On Moscati: G. Gnoli, Mediterraneo Antico 1 (1998) 575-82; G. Susini, RAL 9 (1998) 183-6. On Arias: V. Tusa, SicArch xxxxi.96 (1998 [2000]) 239-40. On Bemab6 Brea: J.-P.

Vallet and A.D. Trendall continue to appear (cf. AR 1995-96, 66-7). One of the bigger tributes to Vallet is the conference held in his memory in Rome and Naples on November 15-18, 1995 (cf. Hommage Vallet). Among the proceedings are articles by M. Gras (7-22) and J.- P. Morel (23-38) on the history of Vallet's thought regarding commerce and pottery (other papers relevant to Sicily are dis- cussed below). There are also two smaller tributes: A. Fratta (ed.), Georges Vallet (Naples 1995), and Hommage a Georges Vallet (Palermo 1997). Another important tribute to Vallet of a different kind is the-reprinting of twenty-eight of his articles in a single volume, Le monde grec colonial d'Italie du Sud et de Sicile [Collection de l'Ecole Francaise de Rome vol. 218] (Rome 1996). On Trendall, there are the following tributes: A. Cambitoglu, Mediterranean Archaeology 8 (1995) 1-8; Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies 41 (1996) 1-30; I. McPhee, Proceedings of the British Academy 97 (1997) 501-17; R. Merrillees, Annual of the British School at Athens 94 (1999) 466-7. Vallet and Trendall passed away just before the publication of an encyclopaedic history of classical archae- ology in two volumes edited by N. Thomson de Grummond, An Encyclopedia of the History of Classical Archaeology (Westport, CT/London 1996). This work, although at times too narrowly focused (cf. the review of G. Shipley, AJA 104 [2000] 127-8), contains a wealth of relevant information, with sever- al short entries dedicated specifically to Sicilian topics, includ- ing prominent scholars like K.J. Beloch, P. Orsi, and T.J. Dunbabin. These and other scholarly figures are treated in other works. M.I. Finley was commemorated with an obituary by one of his colleagues at Cambridge (C.R. Whittaker, Proceedings of the British Academy 94 [1996] 459-72). The themes of S. Mazzarino's work were revisited in a colloquium held in Rome on May 9-11, 1991, with the proceedings pub- lished in A. Giardina (ed.), Convegno per Santo Mazzarino (Rome 1998). On T.J. Dunbabin, there is a brief treatment of his wartime activities in Crete, of both a military and archaeo- logical nature (R. Merrillees, Annual of the British School at Athens 94 [1999] 460-5), as well as a discussion, on the fifti- eth anniversary of the publication of his famous book The Western Greeks (Oxford 1948), of the faulty British Empire analogy he used to model the development of the A Gr city- states of S Italy and Sicily (F. De Angelis, Antiquity 72 [1998] 539-49). It is worth noting that Dunbabin's book was reprint- ed in 1999 by Sandpiper without a preface outlining, among other things, how the work has and has not stood the test of time. On J. Bovio Marconi, excavator of numerous sites in Western Sicily, see Quaderni del Museo Archeologico Regionale 'Antonio Salinas' 2 (1996) 9-51. V. Rizzo has pro- duced a small monograph and exhibition shown in Melilli and Middletown, CT, on the life and work of the Sicilian numis- matist G.E. Rizzo in II maestro Sikelio. Giulio Emmanuele Rizzo: un archeologo del nostro tempo (Palermo/Syracuse 1999). The fiftieth anniversary of the death of E. Ciaceri, the myth and religion specialist, was marked by a small colloqui- um on his life and work; the six papers are published in Sileno 20 (1994) 8-116. P. Orsi, father of modem Sicilian archaeolo- gy, has received an entire conference on his life and work: Atti del convegno Paolo Orsi e l'archeologia del '900, Rovereto 12-13 maggio 1990 [Annali dei Musei Civici di Rovereto, sezione archeologia, storia e scienze naturali, suppl. vol. 6] (Rovereto, 1991). Also welcome is the bibliography of Orsi's writings compiled by A.M. Marchese and G. Marchese, Bibliografia degli scritti di Paolo Orsi (Pisa 2000). In addi- tion, brief treatments of the work of K. Ziegler (K. Abel and P. Pelagatti, Kokalos 42 [1996] 13945) and F.S. Cavallari (G. Uggeri, Journal of Ancient Topography/Rivista di Topografia Antica 6 [1996 (1998)] 162-8; A.M. Marchese, Aitna 3 [1999] 69-83) have appeared. Archival documents of the activities of the Sicilian Antiquities Commission before the creation of the moder Italian state are published and discussed by G. Lo Iacono and C. Marconi, Quaderni del Museo Archeologico Regionale 'Antonio Salinas' supplement to volume 3 (1997). G. Ceserani (Aeneas to Augustus, 174-93) explores the place of C Sicily amongst the modem antiquarians. Sicilian antiquarians of the 19th and 20th Cts working on anc. Anatolia, among whom were individuals (like B. Pace) working on anc. Sicily as well, are studied by G. Salmeri (CdA 26-27 [1987-88 (1996)] 187-94). We might mention here the account of an interesting episode in 1930s academic politics behind a chair in classical archaeolo- gy at Pisa, which involved, among others, B. Pace (V. La Rosa, Studi Pelagatti, 404-8). A brief and very accessible history of Italian classical archaeology into the 1990s is provided by M. Barbanera and N. Terrenato, L 'archeologia degli Italiani: storia, metodi e ori- entamenti dell'archeologia classica in Italia (Rome 1998). Also deserving mention are two histories of German classical archaeology, which was, until recently, the main intellectual influence on Italian classical archaeology: S.L. Marchand, Down from Olympus: archaeology and philhellenism in Germany, 1750-1950 (Princeton 1996), and H. Sichtermann, Kulturgeschichte der Klassichen Archdologie (Munich 1996). The future of classical archaeology is discussed by the sea- soned Sicilian researcher H.P. Isler, excavator of Monte Iato, in a lecture delivered in Vienna to mark the one hundredth anniversary of Austrian excavations at Ephesos: Klassiche Archdologie am Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts (Vienna 1997). The prelude to the Millennium celebrations in Italy, with their dramatic increases in tourism, created a large demand for guidebooks of all stripes. A fourth edition of one of the stan- dard Sicilian guidebooks has appeared: F. Coarelli and M. Torelli, Sicilia (Rome and Bari 1997). On Jewish Sicily, we have the handy overview by N. Bucaria, Sicilia Judaica: guida alle antichitd giudaiche della Sicilia (Palermo 1996). Rich in colour photographs is the work on the Greeks in Italy prepared by N. Panteleaki et al., Magna Grecia: Sicilia, Italia merid- ionale (Athens1998). There are two useful guidebooks for those planning a trip to Sicily: Sicilia: guida turistica (Milan 1998) and Club plein air BdS, Sicilia tesori nascosti: alla scop- erta dei tesori noti e meno noti della Sicilia, appunti di viaggio e suggerimenti per camperisti e amanti del plein air (Palermo 1997). There are three regional guides in the 'Perle di Sicilia' series (published in Italian, English, French and German) out of Messina by Affinita Elettive: on the SE, Avola, Modica, Noto, Ragusa, Scicli (1998); on the NW and Pantelleria, Trapani, Selinunte, Marsala, Egadi, Erice, Mozia, Pantelleria, Segesta (1998); and on the Aeolian islands, Isole Eolie (1997). Two guides to Sicily's art and archaeological museums and collections have also been recently published: R. Carchiolo, Musei e collezioni di Sicilia (Palermo 1999); A. Appiano, Musei in tasca: arte e archeologia in Italia (Alessandria 2000). The Regione Siciliana's website</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 149 (http://www.regione.sicilia.it/) also has much useful informa- tion on the island's anc. attractions. One cannot forget as well work on pre-20th Ct learned travellers to Sicily, whose observations remain valuable. General works include two by C. Ruta, Viaggiatori in Sicilia: l'immagine dell'isola nel secolo dei lumi (Palermo 1998) and Viaggi in Sicilia nel primo ottocento (Palermo 1999). On German and Italian travellers, there are: G. La Rosa, La Sicilia come mito in Goethe e nei viaggiatori tedeschi (Palermo 1996); M. Cometa, Ii romanzo dell'architettura: la Sicilia e il Grand Tour nell'eta di Goethe (Rome 1999); L. Clerici, Viaggiatori italiani in Italia, 1700-1998: per una bibliografia (Milan1999). The Sicilian countryside as viewed by foreign travellers is discussed in N. Famoso (ed.), II paesaggio sicil- iano nella rappresentazione dei viaggiatori stranieri (Catania 1999). On the travels of J. Houel in the Monti Iblei, we have the catalogue of an exhibition shown in Paris and Marseilles: F. Gringeri Pantano (ed.), Jean Houel e la Sicilia. Gli Iblei nel Voyage pittoresque 1776-1779 (Palermo 1999). NATIVE Many of the developments in later Sicilian prehistory previ- ously reported (cf. AR 1995-96, 61, 65-6) have also been reviewed by V. La Rosa, a leading authority, in two articles (Siculorum Gymnasium 48 [1995] 193-204; Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 159-85). These reviews already instilled a sense of the changing attitudes towards Sicily's native populations, which more recent developments have only highlighted further. Two events of 1997 can be considered the watershed: namely, the first conference on Sicilian pre- and protohistory held in Corleone (July 17-20), and the 'Prima Sicilia' exhibition held in Palermo. The conference proceedings are being prepared for publication. Readers who missed the exhibition can now consult a lavishly illustrated catalogue with text written by leading specialists: S. Tusa (ed.), Prima Sicilia: alle origini della societd siciliana: Albergo dei Poveri, Palermo, 18 otto- bre-22 dicembre 1997, 2 vols. (Syracuse 1997); popular accounts of the purpose and content of the exhibition have been written by S. Tusa, Archeologia Viva xvi.63 (1997) 48-59; Archeo xiv.1 (1998) 76-81. Another most welcome develop- ment is the growing awareness of the negative attitudes of past scholarship on Sicily's native populations and of the modem aca- demic and political structures that created and reinforced them (cf. the articles by F. De Angelis and E. Giannitrapani, Antiquity 72 [1998] 539-49 and 739-43, and by S. Stoddart, Antiquity 73 [1999] 703-5). There are several syntheses to report. English-language readers will warmly welcome the well-written and copiously illustrated overview by a leading specialist, R. Leighton, Sicily before History: an archaeological survey from the Palaeolithic to the Iron Age (London and Ithaca, NY 1999) (cf. also Leighton, Aeneas to Augustus, 15-40). Leighton's book has been very favourably reviewed (S. Stoddart, Antiquity 73 [1999] 703-5; M. Fitzjohn, Scholia Reviews 9 [2000] 16; C. Antonaccio, BMCR 00.02.09). Most of the remaining works of synthesis are written in Italian. From the pen of R. Peroni, one of Italy's foremost prehistorians, we have a handbook on themes in material culture (pottery, lithics, settlements, reli- gion, and so on) and a survey of regional developments: Introduzione alla protostoria italiana (Rome and Bari 1994), and L'Italia alle soglie della storia (Rome and Bari 1996). Also in Italian is another handbook by A.M. Bietti Sestieri, Protostoria. Teoria e pratica (Rome 1996), giving an overview of method and theory and a survey of regional devel- opments across the Italian peninsula; although Sicily and Sardinia are excluded from the survey, there is a wealth of rel- evant information here. A good summary of information on the later prehistory and early history of Eastern Sicily and the Aeolian islands can be found in A.M. Bietti Sestieri et al., (eds.), Preistoria e proto- storia in Italia. Sicilia orientale e Isole Eolie [Guide Archeologiche Preistoria e Protostoria in Italia vol. 12] (Forli 1995), whose Italian texts, accompanied by numerous illustra- tions, are translated into English and French. Interest in the native Elymian culture of Western Sicily continues and the dizzying pace of developments is reviewed in three papers by the late G. Nenci (Hommage Vallet, 303-14; Magna e Sicilia, 213-22; Atti elimi III, 809-21). The proceedings of the second Elymian conference (cf. AR 1995-96, 60) have now been pub- lished (Atti elimi II), as have the proceedings of the third con- ference held in 1997 (Atti elimi III). In Atti elimi II, P. Anello (41-75) considers the context for the formation of the Elymian state in the 6th Ct BC, citing political threats from the expand- ing Gr city-states as major factors; S. De Vido (549-80) also explores political and cultural issues in the 6th and 5th Cts BC, emphasizing, among other things, the usually overlooked mar- itime dimension of Elymian culture; V. Tusa (1315-28) exam- ines, mainly via art, the figural element of Elymian culture; and S. Vassallo (1378-84) provides an overview of the A native set- tlements in the Monti Sicani. In Atti elimi III, S. Vassallo (983-1008) notes a pattern of destruction, abandonment, and contraction in native settlements in the interior of Western Sicily in LA to EC times, and connects these events in the set- tlement archaeology with the well-known episodes of military expansion and violence known from literary sources; P. Anello (13-39) examines the history of the Elymian area in the 5th and 4th Cts BC, documenting the rise of Segesta and its interstate alliances; L. Piccirilli (823-48) turns to literary sources other than Thucydides to throw light on questions regarding Athens' Syracusan expedition that are little or scarcely illuminated in the Athenian historian's account; C. Michelini (777-808) investi- gates the artistic history of some Siceliot city-states, using Cicero's De Signis as the main source; and S. De Vido (389-435) looks at Elymian cities found in Cicero's Verrines. (For discussion of the more site-specific contributions, see below.) We should also note a paper by V. Tusa (CdA 26-27 [1987-88 (1996)] 37-51) restating a long-held view that the Elymians came to NW Sicily from Anatolia. On the other hand, G. Castellana (Atti elimi II, 291-302) endorses S. Tusa's theory that the Elymians came from S Italy, recently restated, this time in rather dramatic fashion, in connection with a hut from Mokarta (S. Tusa and F. Nicoletti, Atti elimi III, 963-77). The wealth of new Elymian information and interpretations have encouraged a synthetic account of admirable thoroughness: S. De Vido, Gli Elimi: storie di contatti e di rappresentazioni (Pisa 1997). Of the general works relating more widely to Italy and neighbouring regions, attention can be drawn to the following in particular. On EBA Italy, see D. Cocchi Genick (ed.), L'antica eta del bronzo in Italia: atti del congresso di Viareggio, 9-12 gennaio 1995 (Florence 1996), with five papers on Sicilian subjects. There are two more EBA Sicilian papers on luxury goods and tombs by M. Cultraro and G. Sluga Messina in R. De Marinis et al., (eds.), XIII International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences IV: the Copper Age in the Near East and Europe (Forli 1998) 205-10 and 219-26. The appearance of Central Mediterranean people and products in the LBA Aegean is addressed by M. Betteli (Studi BBPC, 461-72). On social dynamics in the prehistoric Central Mediterranean, there is a collection of papers, three devoted to Sicily, in R.H. Tykot et al., (eds.), Social Dynamics</page><page sequence="6">150 FRANCO DE ANGELIS of the Prehistoric Central Mediterranean [Accordia Specialist Studies on the Mediterranean vol. 3] (London 1999). On IA chiefdoms in many parts of the Mediterranean (though no con- tribution on Sicily itself), there is much food for thought in P. Ruby (ed.), Les princes de la protohistoire et I'emergence de I'etat: actes de la table ronde internationale organisee par le Centre Jean Berard et l'Ecole Franqaise de Rome, Naples, 27-29 octobre 1994 (Naples and Rome 1999). On the peoples of pre-Roman Italy, there is a general work by R. Guerra, Antiche popolazioni dell'Italia preromana: padani, etruschi, lucani...alle origini dell'Italia di oggi (Padua 1999), and on their artwork, one by E.M. De Juliis, Ifondamenti dell'arte italica (Rome and Bari 2000), who takes Italic art on its own merits, avoiding the overly rigid Hellenocentric yardstick of many of his predecessors. On gender and women in anc. Italy, there are volumes by R.D. Whitehouse (ed.), Gender and Italian Archaeology: challenging the stereotypes [Accordia Specialist Studies on Italy vol. 7] (London 1998), and N. Criniti, Imbecillus sexus: le donne nell'Italia antica (Brescia 1999). Broader discussions of developments in Europe as a whole are contained in A.M. Bietti Sestieri and V. Kruta (eds.), The Iron Age in Europe (Forli 1996), and in K. Kristiansen, Europe before History (Cambridge 1998), which encompasses both the BA and IA. Of the native Sicilian case studies, we may begin with matters of chronology. R. Leighton returns (cf. AR 1995-96, 61) to native Sicilian chronology in the EIA (in D. Ridgway et al. (eds.), Ancient Italy in its Mediterranean Setting: studies in honour of Ellen Macnamara [Accordia Specialist Studies on the Mediterranean vol. 4] [London 2000] 33-48). He argues that the Cassibile-Pantalica II phase, usually dated to 1000-850 BC, makes more sense when dated to 925-750 BC, and that the serpentine fibula used as a firm dating tool for the Pantalica III-South phase seems to have been used for a centu- ry longer than usually thought. The implications of these chronological shifts are also considered: Hellenization is viewed as a rather slow process, and no longer is it necessary to postulate that the Greeks encountered in many places an empty landscape. Worth noting as well is the review of radio- carbon dates for the whole of the Italian BA by A. Guidi and R. Whitehouse (Acta Archaeologica 67 [1996] 271-82), who observe, inter alia, that for the later prehistory there is an over- reliance on literary evidence for the establishment of chronolo- gies, and a study on the chronology of BA metal-work by G.L. Carancini and R. Peroni, L'eta del bronzo in Italia: per una cronologia della produzione metallurgica (Perugia 1999). In the realm of pottery, there are several important devel- opments. EBA geometric decoration and its relationship to ves- sel form is explored by S.S. Lukesh (AJA 101 [1997] 369-70; S.S. Lukesh (ed.), Interpretatio Rerum [Archaeologia Transatlantica vol. 17] [Providence, RI 1999] 1-14). Native 'pyxides' of MBA-EIA date are the subject of a study by F. Spatafora, Quaderni del Museo Archeologico Regionale 'Antonio Salinas' 2 (1996) 73-89. A review article by D. Palermo (CdA 31 [1992 (1997)] 17-22) on V. Fatta's work (SicArch xiii.42 [1980] 43-8; La ceramica geometrica di Sant'Angelo Muxaro [Palermo 1983]) argues that the pot Fatta published as a copy of a Euboian pendent-semicircle skyphos (PSC) is more at home in the MBA native Sicilian Thapsos cul- tural tradition. On painted pottery from the mid-9th to 5th Cts BC, there is important work by C. Trombi (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 275-93), who provides a comprehensive overview of shapes and decoration from across the island. T. Hodos (Aeneas to Augustus, 41-54) argues for widespread native adoption of the Gr symposium from the evidence of ceramic imports and imitations. On native settlement structures and patterns from EBA to A times, one can expect in the near future the publication of the proceedings of a conference on the subject: Distribuzione ed organizzazione dell'insediamentofra l'antica etd del Bronzo e I'eta arcaica in Sicilia: atti del convegno, Palermo, 24-25 novembre 1995. On Sicilian tholos tombs, there is the study by F. Tomasello, Le tombe a tholos della Sicilia centro meridionale, in CdA 34-35 (1995-96 [1997]), who hypothesizes that the arrival of this tomb type in Sicily was due to Mycenaean crafts- men fleeing the Aegean after the downfall of the palaces. P. Villari devotes a study to fauna and their role in the economy of LBA Eastern Sicily (La fauna della tarda preistoria nella Sicilia orientale [Palermo 1995] non vidi). On native-Greek relations, there are two works to report: J.E. Coleman and C.A. Walz (eds.), Greeks and Barbarians: essays on the interactions between Greeks and non-Greeks in antiquity and the consequences for Eurocentrism (Bethesda 1997), and, more specifically on the Western Greek area, Atti Taranto XXXVII (reviewed by A. Jacquemin, Topoi 8 [1998] 501-15). In the latter work, among many thought-provoking contributions, are: A. Corcella (43-82) on the frontier in mod- em classical historiography; C. Morgan (85-145), F. Prontera (147-66), and M. Dietler (475-501) on the archaeology and anthropology of ethnicity and identity; S. Marchesini (173-212) on the alphabet in native contexts: R.M. Albanese Procelli (327-59) on culture contact and culture change in east central Sicily; G. Tagliamonte (547-572) on the impact of mer- cenary immigration to Sicily; and C. Ampolo (451-64) on the economic role played by frontier sanctuaries. Elsewhere, in subjects similar to the latter, we may note the following arti- cles: M. Cristofani (Hommage Vallet, 345-60) examines alpha- betic writing and identity amongst the native peoples of A Italy, questioning the view that the appearance of writing signals the onset of urbanism; L. Agostiani and C. De Simone review the state of play on native Sicilian epigraphy in the Sicilia epi- graphica proceedings (1-13 and 499-507); and G. Daverio Rocchi (in U. Fellmeth and H. Sonnabend (eds.), Alte Geschichte: Wege, Einsichten, Horizonte. Festschrift fur Eckart Olshausen zum 60. Geburtstag [Hildesheim 1998] 23-48) tackles the subjects of ethnicity and territory. R. Sammartano examines Greek views of native Sicilian origins in Origines gentium Siciliae: Ellanico, Antioco, Tucidide [Kokalos suppl. vol. 14] (Rome 1998). Sikan religion is the subject of a study by F. Angelini, Sicani: miti e culti, published as a volume ofMythos 6 (1994 [1996]) (cf. the comments of N. Cusumano, Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 763-5). PHOENICIO-PUNIC AND NEAR EASTERN The upward and positive trend in Phoenicio-Punic studies pro- jected long ago by M. Frederiksen (AR 1976-77, 43) has shown no signs of diminishing. That the field continues to develop is indicated, among other ways, by further reflections on the negative attitudes towards the Phoenicians in past schol- arship (M. Liverani, Studi Storici 39 [1998] 5-22) and by pleas for a wider range of questions and approaches (N. Vella, Antiquity 70 [1996] 245-50). Of the works of synthesis, we should first note that a second edition of M. Gras, P. Rouillard, and J. Teixidor, L'Univers phenicien (Paris 1995) has appeared. There are two new syntheses as well: G.E. Markoe, Phoenicians (London 2000) (reviewed by J. Macintosh Turfa, BMCR 01.05.09); M.H. Fantar, Les pheniciens en Mediterranee (Tunis 1997). Elsewhere Fantar (Kontaktzonen, 463-75) has also attempted to define Phoenicio-Punic mental- ites, singling out, in particular, love of risk and adventure,</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 151 adaptability and pragmatism, conservatism and openess, quest for notoriety, piety (without fanaticism), and patriotism. Also of a synthetic nature are the subjects reviews in the Sicilia epi- graphica proceedings by M.G. Amadasi Guzzo (33-45) on epigraphy and R. De Simone (205-19) on onomastics (cf. also Amadasi Guzzo on both these areas in Atti elimi III, 1-12), and two others on recent archaeological research in Western Sicily's Palermo and Trapani provinces in the volume Magna Grecia e Sicilia (223-33, 235-40) by C.A. Di Stefano and V. Tusa. It is perhaps not out of place here to mention that the proceedings of the IIIrd international conference on Phoenicio- Punic studies held in 1991 have now appeared in two volumes in M.H. Fantar and M. Ghaki (eds.), Actes du II1e Congres International des Etudes Pheniciennes et Puniques, Tunis, 11-16 novembre 1991 (Tunis 1995). The city of Carthage and its relationship with other peo- ples, both dependent and independent, in the Central and Western Mediterranean is another area of research that has been strong in this period. On Carthage itself, there are syn- theses by M.H. Fantar, Carthage: la cit punique (Paris 1995), and by S. Lancel, Carthage: a history (Oxford 1995) (a trans- lation by A. Nevill of a 1992 French original). On Carthage's relations with other peoples may be noted G. Pisano (ed.), Phoenicians and Carthaginians in the Western Mediterranean [Studia Punica vol. 12] (Rome 1999): note essays by G. Garbini (9-14) on Phoenicians and 'others', pleading for stud- ies on the differences between Phoenician culture in the Levant and in Central and Western Mediterranean; S.F. Bondi (39-48) on Carthage not experiencing any '5th Ct Problem' after the battle of Himera as C. Picard had believed; A.C. Fariselli (59-67) on the impact of military preparation on Carthage; L.I. Manfredi (69-78) on Carthage's policies as reflected in coinage; and A. Mezzolani (107-22) on bathrooms in houses. Elsewhere, S. Moscati, RAL 5 (1994) 203-14 examines Carthaginian expansion in Africa, and on Carthaginian-Greek relations, we have an insightful book by V. Krings, Carthage et les Grecs, ca 580-480 av. J.-C. (Leiden 1998) (cf. also the summary by Krings in Kontaktzonen, 499-513). In Studi Moscati, we can note two articles in particular: S.F. Bondi (21-8), who argues, against the current consensus, that the pur- pose of Malchus' expeditions in Sicily and Sardinia was to force the Phoenician cities there to recognize Carthage's hege- mony, and A. Cutroni Tusa (111-5), who suggests Carthage tampered very little in Sicilian monetary policy because of the island's previous long tradition of coinage. Another noteworthy feature of recent work is the growth and development of ceramic studies. Archaeometry is becoming more common, taking its place alongside the tradi- tional approaches, as may be seen in the proceedings of two conferences: E. Acquaro and B. Fabbri (eds.), Produzione e circolazione della ceramica fenicia e punica (Bologna 1998), and P. Bartolini and L. Campanella (eds.), La ceramicafenicia di Sardegna: dati, problematiche, confronti (Rome 2000). Also very welcome is the bulky study of Phoenicio-Punic amphoras in the Central and Western Mediterranean by J. Ramon Torres, Las anforas fenicio-punicas del Mediterrcneo central y occidental (Barcelona 1995). One might also draw attention to the publication of some Punic pottery from Malta in two Australian collections (C. Sagona, Mediterranean Archaeology 9-10 [1996-97] 29-52). These studies also have major implications for questions of trade and interaction, which are discussed in the latter works and in others. In this regard, there are papers by by S. Moscati (RAL 5 [1994] 473-85) on Phoenicians in Portugal, by C. Sagona (Oxford Journal of Archaeology 18 [1999] 23-60) on Maltese textiles as an attraction for early Phoenician interest in the island, by B. Patzek on the transmission of O influences to early Greek cul- ture (Miinsterische Beitrdge zur antiken Handelsgeschichte 15.2 [1996] 1-32), and by L.-M. Gunther (Studi Moscati, 789-99) on the Phoenician part in the development of the Greek polis (on the comparative perspective in city-state development, see also M.H. Hansen (ed.), A Comparative Study of Thirty City-state Cultures [Copenhagen 2000]; cf. the notice of N. James, Antiquity 75 [2001] 197-8). On other Near Eastern peoples at home and abroad, we may note two articles on the Cypriot role in LBA and EIA Mediterranean trade and interaction by C. Graziadio (Studi Classici e Orientali 46 [1997] 681-719) and H. Matthaus (Kontaktzonen, 73-91). There is also a wealth of new infor- mation and interpretations on the foregoing chronological peri- ods in S. Gitin et al. (eds.), Mediterranean Peoples in Transition. thirteenth to early tenth centuries BCE (Jerusalem 1998), including an article by J.N. Coldstream (353-60) on the unanswerable question of who initiated the first exchanges between Euboians and Phoenicians. On Syria, from prehisto- ry to present, we have the colourful catalogue of the travelling Canadian exhibition organized by M. Fortin, Syria: land of civ- ilizations (Quebec 1999), which provides good background reading on a region which had an impact on protohistoric and A Greece and Italy (cf. most recently J. Boardman, The Greeks Overseas: their early colonies and trade, 4th edn. [London 1999] 270-2). The cultural, artistic, and economic relations between the E Mediterranean (including E Greece) and S Italy up to the HL period can now be extensively followed in A. Stazio and S. Ceccoli (eds.), Magna Grecia e Oriente mediter- raneo prima dell'eta ellenistica: atti del trentanovesimo con- vegno di studi sulla Magna Grecia, Taranto, 1-5 ottobre 1999 (Taranto 2000). GREEK Architecture and urbanism. On the domestic architecture of Magna Graecia and Sicly, a volume edited by F. D'Andria and K. Mannino, Ricerche sulla casa in Magna Grecia e in Sicilia. Atti del colloquio, Lecce, 23-24 giugno 1992 (Galatina 1996) (reviewed by M. Gras, Topoi 7 [1997] 1103-8; J.-L. Lamboley, Revue des Etudes Anciennes 99 [1997] 590-2; L. Nevett, AJA 102 [1998] 636-7; V. Righini, Rivista Storica dell'Antichita 28 [1998] 251-5), contains articles on Herakleia Minoa (see 'Southern Sicily' below) and on Sicily as a whole by E. De Miro (17-0), an update of his earlier similar work published in Philias Charin: miscellanea di studi classici in onore di Eugenio Manni II (Rome 1980) 709-37. On activity areas in A houses (especially those of Monte San Mauro), we have a brief piece by O. Belvedere (Studi Pelagatti, 58-68), and on C and HL housing in the anc. Greek world (including Sicily), we have the thorough and long-awaited study by one of the leading specialists on the subjects: L. Nevett, House and Society in the Ancient Greek World (Cambridge 1999) (reviewed by D.W.J. Gill, BMCR 00.08.25). The thesis of A. Mazarakis Ainian, expounded in numerous articles, that the architecture and religious activities of DA Greek rulers' dwellings were carried over into temples with the rise of polis, has now been thoroughly expressed in his From Rulers' Dwellings to Temples. architecture, religion and society in Early Iron Age Greece (1100-700 BC) [Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology vol. 121] (Jonsered 1997). This wide-ranging work, which occasionally mentions Western Greek developments, provides a fitting transition to the most commonly studied area of Sicilian Greek architecture, namely temples and other public buildings. The written and materi- al evidence for Sicily's bouleuteria has been helpfully assem-</page><page sequence="8">152 FRANCO DE ANGELIS bled by A. Ianello (QuadMess 9 [1994 (1996)] 63-98). On the social context of temple-building, B. Fehr (Hephaistos 14 [1996] 165-91) has stressed the contribution of less well-to-do individuals alongside the wealth and rivalries of the aristocra- cy. On the latter theme, the notes of R.R. Holloway for a lec- ture given at Washington University (St. Louis) in the spring of 1997 are published on the website of Brown University's Center for Old World Archaeology and Art located at http://www. brown. edu/Departments/Old_ World_Archaeology_ and_Art/Publications/daedalus/chapterl.html). What is known of the temples of Akragas, Segesta, and Selinous is summarized well by G. Blandi, I templi di Agrigento, Segesta e Selinunte: storia, architettura, tecnica (Palermo 2000). The final chapter of this work contains numerous reconstructions of the tools, methods, and processes used in temple-building. A detailed study has been dedicated to the Western Greek influ- ences on temple roofs in the Greek homeland (N.L. Klein, Hesperia 67 [1998] 335-74). Sicily also appears frequently in M.B. Hollinshead's article (Hesperia 68 [1999] 189-218) on the adytum and opisthodomus of Greek temples. Interior stair- cases in Western Greek temples are examined in a careful study, as we have come to expect, from the pen of M.M. Miles (MAAR 43-44 [1998-99] 1-26). Miles suggests that these staircases were used for ritual ascents and connects this feature with influences deriving from Phoenicia and the Near East. Affinities between Sicily and Anatolia in the sphere of archi- tecture and urbanism have been thoroughly investigated in sev- eral contributions (deriving from a conference) published in CdA 26-27 (1987-88 [1996]) by M. Usman Anabolu (61-9), G. Gullini (71-8), P. Sommella (79-88), N. Bonacasa (139-58), and E. De Miro (159-65). On the subject of foreign influences and hybridity in Western Greek architecture, we should also note articles by B.A. Barletta (MAAR 41 [1996] 1-67) and D. Mertens (in G. Pugliese Carratelli (ed.), Magna Grecia, Etruschi, Fenici: atti del trentatreesimo convegno di studi sulla Magna Grecia: Taranto, 8-13 ottobre 1993 [Taranto 1996] 195-219). To whet the appetite of those interested in anc. Greek urbanism, we have the proceedings of two Danish confer- ences: H.D. Andersen et al. (eds.), Urbanization in the Mediterranean in the 9th to 6th centuries BC [Acta Hyperborea vol. 7] (Copenhagen 1997), and M.H. Hansen (ed.), The Polis as an Urban Centre and as a Political Community. Symposium August, 29-31 1996 (Copenhagen 1997). The first volume contains two contributions on Megara Hyblaia and Morgantina (see the sections 'South-East Sicily' and 'Central Sicily' below), as well as an attempt to define the features of anc. Greek urbanism (M. Vink, 111-41). The sec- ond volume has two important articles, one by Hansen (9-86) and the other by C. Morgan and J.J. Coulton (87-144), on the polis as a physical entity in written and archaeological sources (there is another paper in this volume on Kamarina reported on below in the 'South-East Sicily' section). The state of play on many well-explored Greek cities can be found in a text edited by E. Greco, La citta greca antica: istituzioni, societa eforme urbane (Rome 1999), with articles on Megara Hyblaea (M. Gras, 251-67) and Himera (N. Allegro, 269-301). Mediterranean megalopoleis, from anc. to moder times, are the subject of a fittingly gargantuan volume: C. Nicolet et al. (eds.), Megalopoles mediterraneennes. geographie urbaine retrospective: actes du colloque organise par 'Ecole Franqaise de Rome et la Maison mediterraneenne des sciences de l'homme (Rome, 8-11 mai 1996) [Collection de l'lcole Franqaise de Rome vol. 261] (Rome 2000). The essays rele- vant to antiquity deal primarily with the main megalopoleis (Athens, Carthage, Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, and Byzantium, though their Sicilian counterparts make occasion- al appearances as well) from a variety of viewpoints, such as demography, food supply, monumentality, and infrastructure. There is also a volume dedicated entirely to A Gr Sicily (G. Rizza (ed.), Architettura e urbanistica nella Sicilia greca. Atti della 3A riunione scientifica della scuola di perfezionamento in archeologia classica dell'Universitd di Catania (Siracusa, 11-14 dicembre 1980), published with unrevised texts in 1994 (!) as CdA 19 [1980], and containing material already reported on by my predecessors). S. Grimaudo has devoted a study to land division amongst the anc. Greeks (Misurare epesare nella Grecia antica: teorie, storia, ideologie [Palermo 1998]). A. Wasowicz, the well-known authority on town planning, has suggested that there existed a Megarian model of town plan- ning characterized by, among other things, an orthogonal egal- itarian organization into rectangles (in M. Brunet (ed.), Territoires des cites grecques [BCH suppl. vol. 34] [Paris 1999] 245-58). The reverse situation, inequality in town plan- ning, is tackled by M. Bell (AJA 101 [1997] 382). There have also been numerous studies on individual features of Western Greek urbanism. E. Greco (Studi Orlandini, 223-9) investi- gates street names in Greek cities (which includes some dis- cussion of Kamarina). There is yet another paper by Greco (Ktema 23 [1998 (1999)] 153-8) on the large size of Western Greek agoras. A thorough re-examination of all aspects of the A and C agora across the anc. Greek world is provided by U. Kenzler, Studien zur Entwicklung und Struktur der grichischen Agora in archdischer und klassischer Zeit [Europaische Hochschulschriften Archaologie, series XXXVIII, vol. 72] (Frankfurt am Main 1999). This is a most welcome work, since the last synthesis on this topic is now out-of-date (R. Martin, Recherches sur l'agora grecque [Paris 1951], where the focus, because of the availability of evidence, is mainly on the HL period). Kenzler traces the origin of the agora back to DA Greece, and concludes that there is no certain case of a stoa used for commercial purposes in A agoras. On other functions of the C agora, attention can be drawn to the work of L. Soverini, Il sofista e l'agord: sapienti, economia e vita quotid- iana nella Grecia classica (Pisa 1998). Fortification studies have benefited from two syntheses: M. Miller, Befestigungsanlagen in Italien vom 8. bis 3. Jahrhundert vor Christus (Hamburg 1995), and a forthcoming work by R.M. Carra Bonacasa and A. Tullio, Le fortificazioni antiche della Sicilia (Rome). The relationship between empty space inside the city wall and level of population, labelled by the late G. Nenci 'la zona di rispetto', is comprehensively explored by A. Muggia, L 'area di rispetto nelle colonie magno-greche e sice- liote: studio di antropologia della forma urbana (Palermo 1997) (reviewed by F. De Angelis, AJA 103 [1999] 143-5). Nenci hypothesized that cities with densely settled territories reserved much open urban space as a retreat for their rural pop- ulation in times of crisis. Muggia tests this proposition, with a database of fifteen sites and a battery of statistical methods, and arrives at the opposite conclusion, namely that urban pop- ulation size conditioned the size of 'la zona di rispetto'. A more general work on the impact of urbanization on the coun- tryside of Gr Sicily has also appeared: E. Antonini, Problemi dell'urbanizzazione e del rapporto cittd campagna in Sicilia dall'eta arcaica all' etd di Agatocle (Macerata 1996) (non vidi). Much comparative material on the city elsewhere in Italy and in Greece can be found in two other recent works: F. Lang, Archaische Siedlungen in Griechenland: Struktur und Entwicklung (Berlin 1996), and L. Quilici and S. Quilici Gigli (eds.), Cittd e monumenti nell'Italia antica [Atlante Tematico di Topografia Antica vol. 7] (Rome 1999). On Sicilian funer- ary space, from the 9th to 1St Cts BC, there is a valuable sum-</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 153 mary by A. Iacovella and Y. Auda, Archeologia e Calcolatori 5 (1994) 69-86. An interest in chronology has been rekindled after a some- what dormant period. Unlike earlier debates (cf. M. Gras, Revue Belge de Philologie et d'Histoire 64 [1986] 11-6), this most recent work has made, in the view of the present writer, a positive contribution to this all-important field by acknowl- edging in particular its limitations and questioning what are seemingly the reliable points in chronological frameworks. This approach appears in the two studies dealing with the Near Eastern material published in this period: L. Hannestad, Acta Archaeologica 67 (1996) 39-49, and D. Gill and M. Vickers, MDAI(R) 103 (1996) 1-9. The former reviews the Near East and Greece in the EIA, while the latter looks at Bocchoris the Wise and his scarab from Pithekoussai, and argues that this may not be as fixed a point in early Gr chronology as some scholars have suggested. But not all news on chronology from Near Eastern studies is negative. J.C. Waldbaum and J. Magness, AJA 101 (1997) 23-40 present new evidence from Israel for the dating of 7th-Ct East Gr and Cor pottery. On the dating of the early Gr settlements in Sicily, there are articles by I. Morris (Acta Archaeologica 67 [1996] 51-9) and K.-K. Weber (Die Alte Stadt 24 [1997] 331-6), who, after reviewing the evidence for absolute chronology, both conclude that the present system is, despite its problems, on the whole essential- ly solid. A valuable critical overview of the last decade of work on Greek and Roman demography is provided by M. Golden, in P. Flensted-Jensen et al. (eds.), Polis and Politics: studies in ancient Greek history presented to Mogens Herman Hansen on his sixtieth birthday, August 20, 2000 (Copenhagen 2000) 23-40, who cautions against accepting average figures too readily. On Sicilian Gr demography in particular, there are rel- evant sections in works by A. Muggia, C. Nicolet et al., and F. De Angelis discussed elsewhere (see above and below). The state of Sicilian skeletal studies has been authoritatively sum- marized by M.J. Becker (Accordia Research Papers 6 [1995-96] 83-117). Becker observes that, after initial interest in the 19th Ct, the study of anc. populations by physical anthro- pology went into considerable decline until the 1980s, and that still today cremation burials are often ignored because they are thought to provide little or no potential for analysis. Becker suggests that future work could focus on cultural and biologi- cal differences between populations and on the impact of the arrival of agriculture and of rural versus urban settings on anc. populations (for work along these lines, see the sections 'Central Sicily' and 'Southern Sicily' below). Inspiration might also be sought from work in other parts of Italy (cf. J.E. Robb, AJA 100 [1996] 773-6; J.C. Carter, The Chora of Metaponto: the necropoleis, 2 vols. [Austin 1998]). On mat- ters of health, we have an article by H. Broise (Xenia Antiqua 3 [1994] 17-32) on hot bathing in HL S Italy and Sicily and an important volume by R. Ginouves et al. (eds.), L'eau, la sante et la maladie dans le monde grec [BCH suppl. vol. 28] (Paris 1994). This volume contains several relevant articles: there is a piece by M.-C. Hellmann (273-82) on written and archaeo- logical evidence for cisterns, another by S. Colin Bouffier (321-36) on marshland and malaria amongst the Western Greeks, which argues that no certain evidence of malaria as a health hazard exists, and yet another by F. Villard (337-42) on the role of disease during the C and HL sieges of Syracuse (the articles by L. Bernab6 Brea [169-81] and M. Cavalier [183-92] on the thermal complex at San Calogero on the island of Lipari have already been reported on in AR 1995-96, 83). Sicilian marshlands, especially those of Kamarina, also feature in F. Borca's article in V.M. Hope and E. Marshall (eds.), Death and Disease in the Ancient City (London 2000) 74-84 (this volume contains much food for thought on other areas of demography and health). For thorough reviews of developments in Sicily's Greek epigraphy, readers may consult: Supplementum Ephigraphicum Graecum 45 (1995 [1998]) 353-75, nos. 1341-1427; 46 (1996 [1999]) 340-55, nos. 1240bis-1301; A. Brugnone, Kokalos 43-44 (1997-98) 573-605 (covering the years 1993-97); and G. Manganaro (Sicilia epigraphica, 417-37, and in XI congresso internazionale di epigrafia greca e latina, Roma, 18-24 settembre 1997 [Rome 1999] 147-56). I will limit myself primarily to discussing general develop- ments that have occurred since the publication of these reviews, leaving the epigraphy of individual sites to the second part of this report. In an historiographic piece, S. De Vido (Sicilia epigraphica, 221-50) examines the history of modem epigraphic corpora in Sicily from the early 17th to late 19th Cts. There is much new material, as well as reflections on older material, from the active pen of G. Manganaro, Sikelika. Studi di antichitd e di epigrafia della Sicilia greca [Biblioteca di Quaderni Urbinati di Cultura Classica 8] (Pisa and Rome 1999) (reviewed by F. De Angelis, BMCR 00.07.13), and in PdP 52 (1997) 306-48 (on new lead tablets). Several articles of another active Sicilian epigraphist have been reprinted: R. Arena, Scritti filologici e linguistici (Milan 1999); the same author offers a contribution on the language and lettering of Sicilian Gr inscriptions (Sicilia epigraphica, 47-51), as well as two instalments to his corpora of A Western Greek inscriptions: Iscrizioni greche arcaiche di Sicilia e Magna Grecia V: iscrizioni di Taranto, Locri Epizefiri, Velia e Siracusa (Alessandria 1998), and a second edition of Iscrizioni greche arcaiche di Sicilia e Magna Grecia I: iscrizioni di Megara Iblea e Selinunte (Pisa 1996) (originally published in 1989). J. Curbera (Sicilia epigraphica, 159-86) provides us with an overview of his forthcoming study of curse tablets, and A. Johnston (Sicilia epigraphica, 407-15) provides another overview of graffiti. For those interested in onomastics, there is a wealth of information in P.M. Fraser and E. Matthews (eds.), A Lexicon of Greek Personal Names IIIA: the Peloponnese, Western Greece, Sicily and Magna Graecia (Oxford 1997) (reviewed by C. Tuplin, Classical Review 49 [1999] 593-4), and, less dramatic though equally valuable, in G. Manganaro, ZPE 133 (2000) 123-34 and F. Cordano (Atti elimi III, 311-6). The transmission and uses of alphabetic writ- ing in the anc. world continue to be a source of fascination in recent scholarship. Very helpful and critical reviews of the state of play on these subjects during the period of Gr overseas exploration and settlement may be consulted in G. Bagnasco Gianni and F. Cordano (eds.), Scritture mediterranee tra il 9. e il 7. secolo a.C.: atti del seminario, Universitd degli studi di Milano, Istituto di Storia Antica, 23-24febbraio 1998 (Milan 1999). Among the conclusions reached and points emphasized in this volume, attention can be drawn to the following in par- ticular: M.G. Amadasi Guzzo (27-51) considers the Aramaic origin of the Gr alphabet unlikely; M.L. Lazzarini (53-66) underlines the importance of Euboia in the spread of writing and the different uses to which different regions of the anc. Gr world put the alphabet; and A.C. Cassio (67-84) concludes that the Euboians were among the first, if not the first, to write the Homeric epics. On literacy, there are articles by G. Manganaro (Mediterraneo Antico 1 [1998] 247-70) and A.L. Prosdocimi (Sicilia epigraphica, 465-82). Western Sicily's multi-lingual- ism during classical antiquity has been investigated in an inter- esting article by the late G. Nenci, Scrittura e Civiltd 20 (1996) 7-19. There are two other works on writing in the anc. world that make reference to Sicily: G. Pugliese Carratelli (ed.), La</page><page sequence="10">154 FRANCO DE ANGELIS cittd e la parola scritta (Milan 1997), and E.A. Arslan et al. (eds.), La 'parola' delle immagini e delle forme di scrittura: modi e tecniche della comunicazione nel mondo antico (Messina 1998). Historical Topics. We may begin with the reviews of scholarship that have appeared. Some of the literature pub- lished between 1993 and 1996 has been reviewed by S. Cataldi and E. De Miro in Kokalos 43-44 (1997-98) 497-553 and 701-25. Other very important reviews, though less Sicilian in content, can be found in C.G. Thomas (ed.), Ancient History: recent work and new directions [Publications of the Association of Ancient Historians vol. 5] (Claremont, CA, 1997). Particularly noteworthy is the piece on the A and C Gr world by K. Raaflaub (1-35), who emphasizes, among other things, that studies comparing the evolution of Aegean Greek city-states and those founded overseas are needed and that Greek economic history lags well behind its Roman counter- part. Numerous general works have been published in this peri- od. Of those where Sicily is part of a larger picture, we may note that there has been a reprint, with a fresh introductory essay, of the classic book on DA Greece by A.M. Snodgrass, The Dark Age of Greece: an archaeological survey of the eleventh to eighth centuries BC (Edinburgh 2000). There is another new book on DA Greece by C.G. Thomas and C. Conant, Citadel to City-state: the transformation of Greece, 1200-700 B.C.E (Bloomington/Indianapolis 1999). Students of the Greeks overseas will be pleased that a fourth edition of another classic book has appeared: J.Boardman, The Greeks Overseas: their early colonies and trade (London 1999), with minor corrections and a new final chapter which reviews developments in the field during the last two decades. For the Greeks overseas from a literary perspective, we have the work by T. Miller, Die griechische Kolonisation im Spiegel liter- arischer Zeugnisse (Tiibingen 1997) (reviewed by G.R. Tsetskhladze, Classical Review 49 [1999] 602). Also on the early Gr period are three other books. There is a concise but penetrating thematic account by M. Gras, La Mediterranee archaique (Paris 1995), which has been translated into Italian, Spanish, and Portugese (cf. the review of the Italian edition by N. Vella, IJNA 28 [1999] 301-2). Focused more, but not entirely, on the Greek homeland is R. Osborne, Greek in the Making, 1200-479 BC (London/York 1996), and C. Baurain, Les Grecs et la Mediterranee orientale: des siecles 'obscurs'a la fin de I'epoque archaique (Paris 1997). Broader, chrono- logically speaking, is the four volume (in six parts) history of the anc. Greek world by S. Settis (ed.), I Greci: storia, cultura, arte, societd (Turin 1995-) (cf the review of the first two vol- umes by R. Osborne, JHS 120 [2000] 106-7), and the two-vol- ume work by G. Speake (ed.), Encyclopedia of Greece and the Hellenic Tradition (London/Chicago 2000). On more archaeo- logical matters, there is the ongoing updating of the Enciclopedia dell'arte antica, classica e orientale, secondo supplemento 1971-94, I-V (Rome 1994-1997). Among the general works focusing on Sicily itself, a slightly corrected reprint of R.R. Holloway, The Archaeology of Ancient Sicily (London/New York 2001; first published 1991) has appeared; an Italian edition translated by V. Caminneci and G. Zavettieri has come out as Archeologia della Sicilia antica (Turin 1995). Another standard work that has been reprinted is F. Cordano, Antiche fondazioni greche: Sicilia e Italia meridionale (Palermo 2000; first published 1986). New general works include three succinct syntheses on Sicily by H. Hartmann and C. Wetzel, Sizilien. Zeugnisse aus 3000 Jahren Kultur (Darmstadt 1996), F. Carlotta, Breve storia della Sicilia antica (Palermo 1998), and L. Braccesi and G. Millino, La Sicilia greca (Rome 2000), as well as four others on the Western Greeks and their world more generally by M.V. Antico Gallina (ed.), I Greci nel sud dell'Italia (Rome 1995); M.V. Antico Gallina (ed.), Civiltd insulari: popoli di terra, popoli di mare (Milan 1996); J.-L. Lamboley, Les Grecs d'Occident: la peri- ode archaique (Paris 1996); and V.M. Manfredi, I greci d'Occidente (Milan 1996). There have been as well some pop- ular glossy accounts of Sicily in archaeological magazines: P.G. Guzzo, I Greci in Italia (Le monografie di Archeo; April 1996); S. Moscati, Archeo xiii.7 (1997) 36-49; Dossiers d 'Archeologie 225 (July-August 1997); J. Lange, Sicilia: l 'iso- la delle meraviglie (Le monografie di Archeo; June 1998); Antiqua: rivista di Archeoclub d'Italia xxiv.3-5 (1999). Moving on to the more period-specific studies, there are several works to note on Gr activity in Sicily during the Bronze and Dark Ages. Two reviews of recent developments in M and Myc prehistory, prepared by C.W. Shelmerdine (AJA 101 [1997] 537-85), and P. Rehak and J.G. Younger (AJA 102 [1998] 91-173), both include discussion of overseas activities. On Myc connections with the Central and Western Mediterranean, we have two useful updates on the pottery by one of the leading specialists in the field, L. Vagnetti, who observes how study of the Sicilian material lags behind other regions of Italy (in S. Gitin et al. (eds.), Mediterranean Peoples in Transition: thirteenth to early tenth centuries BCE [Jerusalem 1998] 66-77, and J.-P. Crielaard et al. (eds.), The Complex Past of Pottery. production, circulation, and con- sumption of Mycenaean and Greek pottery (sixteenth to early fifth centuries BC) [Amsterdam 1999] 137-61). We also have two attempts at broader historical reconstruction, made possi- ble thanks to work undertaken by Vagnetti and others: L. Re (Studi BBPC, 405-13) notes the paucity of LH I-II pottery in the Near East as compared with its growing presence in Italy and neighbouring islands, while G. Graziadio (Studi Micenei ed Egeo-Anatolici 40 [1998] 29-76) provides a welcome overview of Mediterranean-wide trade in the Shaft Grave peri- od. (The recent exciting discoveries of Greek BA activity at specific Sicilian sites are dealt with below: see 'Southern Sicily'). On Gr and Near Eastern activity in the W from LBA to G times, we have an interesting paper by J. Boardman (Hommage Vallet, 39-50), who argues, inter alia, that the Greeks must have maintained contact with the W through the DA, despite the silence of the material record, and that, con- trary to the opinion of A.J. Graham (see immediately below), the first Greek settlers in the W could have managed easily without professional priestesses. On the faulty terminology used to describe Gr overseas set- tlement in the Geometric period, we have the following works: J.P. Wilson questioning the apoikia versus emporion distinction in this early period (in L.G. Mitchell and P.J. Rhodes (eds.), The Development of the Polis in Archaic Greece [London/New York 1997] 199-207); F. De Angelis, Antiquity 72 (1998) 539-49, involving a case study on T.J. Dunbabin's interpretative framework (cited earlier in the 'history of schol- arship' section); R. Osborne on the general inappropriateness of the word 'colonization' (in N. Fisher and H. van Wees (eds.), Archaic Greece: new approaches and new evidence [London 1998] 251-69); and the posthumous publication ofE. Lepore's 1982 Paris lectures in La Grand Grece: aspects et problemes d 'une &lt;colonisation&gt;&gt; ancienne (Naples 2000). On Corinth and Cor activities in the W, there are several important and up-to- date contributions in Atti Taranto XXXIV. On Euboia and Euboian activites in the W, most welcome is the volume by M. Bats and B. D'Agostino (eds.), Euboica: I'Eubea e la presen- za euboica in Calcidica e in Occidente: atti del convegno inter- nazionale di Napoli, 13-16 novembre 1996 (Naples 1998)</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 155 (reviewed by J.K. Papadopoulos, AJA 104 [2000] 134-5); two papers relevant to Sicily are discussed below. On the level of Euboian activity abroad, we have three articles by J.K. Papadopoulos deflating, to a certain degree rightly, some ele- vated modem opinions (Oxford Journal of Archaeology 15 [1996] 151-81; Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology 10 [1997] 191-219; Oxford Journal of Archaeology 18 [1999] 377-94), whereas J. Boardman establishes criteria for identify- ing Euboians in the material record (in D. Evely et al. (eds.), Minotaur and Centaur: studies in the archaeology of Crete and Euboea presented to Mervyn Popham [British Archaeological Reports International Series vol. 638] [Oxford 1996] 155-60). J.-P. Crielaard compares Euboian and Phoenician overseas set- tlement, and argues that they were primarily interested in, respectively, land and trade (in H.G. Niemeyer (ed.), Die Akten des Internationalen Kolloquiums 'Interactions in the Iron Age: Phoenicians, Greeks and the Indigenous peoples of the Western Mediterranean' [Mainz 1996] 235-60). The reverse position to Crierlaard's-that trade was the dominant motive in 8th-Ct Gr overseas settlement-is argued by D.W. Tandy, Warriors into Traders: the power of the market in early Greece (Berkeley 1997) (reviewed by D.M. Schaps, BMCR 98.11.01). The status of Al Mina has also come under focus in these and other studies, the various positions having become rather pre- dictable: many Gr archaeologists, with the notable exception of Papadopoulos, pretty much stand firm on the site's Greekness (see also R.A. Kearsley and J.Boardman, in G.R. Tsetskhladze (ed.), Ancient Greeks West and East [Leiden 1999] 109-34 and 135-161, and T. Hodos, in G.R. Tsetskhladze et al. (eds.), Periplous: papers on classical art and archaeology presented to Sir John Boardman [London 2000] 145-52). Near Eastern scholars, on the other hand, tend to view the matter entirely dif- ferently (cf., for instance, J.C. Waldbaum, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 305 [1997] 1-17). On the phenomenon of forced migration and clauses forbidding settlers to return home in the early Gr period, M. Moggi pro- vides a thought-provoking contribution in M. Sordi (ed.), Coercizione e mobilitd umana nel mondo antico [Contributi dell'Istituto di Storia Antica dell'Universita del Sacro Cuore vol. 21] (Milan 1995) 27-49, suggesting that such factors could have lain behind the Megarians' tenacity to found a set- tlement in Sicily (This volume also contains an article by A. Giuliani [107-24] on the forced migrations of Dionysius I). There is still much ink being spilt on women, ethnicity, and identity amongst the early Western Greeks. These three topics are brought together by K. Brodersen (Mnemosyne 47 [1994] 47-63) in a thought-provoking piece. On intermarriage with native women, A.J. Graham re-affirms an old position by examining the way women are presented in Homer's Odyssey (in B. Cohen (ed.), The Distaff Side: representing the female in Homer [New York/Oxford 1995] 3-16). T. Hodos and G. Shepherd arrive at the same conclusion, that native fibulae in burials were not acquired through intermarriage, but rather through trade (in, respectively, Oxford Journal ofArchaeology 18 [1999] 61-78, and G.R. Tsetskhladze (ed.), Ancient Greeks West and East [Leiden 1999] 267-300). Both, however, have very little or nothing to say about the distinctive native-style burial rituals widely found in the cemeteries they study. Of the works relating to the Archaic period, we may start by observing the continuing active interest in the island's tyrannies. An excellent and concise synthesis is provided by L. Braccesi, I tiranni di Sicilia (Rome/Bari 1998), who argues that Sicily's tyrannies were distinct from those elsewhere in the Greek world. We have another work of synthesis by M. Hofer, Tyrannen, Aristokraten, Demokraten (Frankfurt am Main 2000). S. Lewis (Aeneas to Augustus, 97-106) has explored the persistence and myths surrounding Sicily's Gr tyrants. The reign of Gelon, treated particularly from the viewpoint of polit- ical ideology and propaganda, is examined by G. Mafodda, La monarchia di Gelone tra pragmatismo, ideologia e propagan- da (Messina 1996). By the same author we have an article on native-tyrant relations, which the literary sources present as violent (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 313-9). The alleged Cypriot background of the Deinomenids is exposed by M. Giuffrida (Kokalos 42 [1996] 283-301) as part of the rhetoric used to establish political ties with other parts of the Greek world. The likening of Western Greek tyrants to oikists is explored by A. Jacquemin (Ktema 18 [1993 (1996)] 19-27). On art and tyran- ny, we have a general survey of the Greek world by A.J. Dominguez Monedero (in A.J. Dominguez Monedero and C. Sanchez Fernmndez (eds.), Arte y Poder en el Mundo Antiguo [Madrid 1997] 81-125). Sicilian tyrants made considerable use of mercenaries, and were probably some of the first Greeks to do so on a regular basis, as observed by M. Bettalli in I mer- cenari nel mondo greco I: dalle origini allafine del Vsec. a.C. (Pisa 1995). Sport was another area that the Sicilian Greek tyrants patronized with fervour, and it is to M. Golden that we owe an up-to-date synthesis entitled Sport and Society in Ancient Greece [Key Themes in Ancient History] (Cambridge 1998). On the Dorieus and his actions in the West, we have a new study by L. Braccesi, L 'enigma Dorieo [Hesperia vol. 11] (Rome 1999) (cf. the author's summary thoughts in Atti elimi III, 167-79). On the Classical period, there are the proceedings of a con- ference on Athenian political policy in the West published as a special issue of the journal Ostraka 6 (1997) 87-178. T. Harrison (Aeneas to Augustus, 84-96) notes parallels between Herodotus' account of the Persian Wars and Thucydides' account of the Athenian expedition against Syracuse, arguing that they are connected with Athenian representations of poli- tics and history. G. Vanotti (Kokalos 42 [1996] 327-40) inves- tigates how the Menelaos myth was given new life in the late 5th Ct by Syracuse (?) for political purposes against Athens. P. Anello (Kokalos 42 [1996] 327-40) devotes an article to the connections between Dionysius I and Athens; on the latter tyrant's use of Celtic mercenaries, we have a brief piece by D. Sinatra (Kokalos 42 [1996] 373-81). On the Greek world in the 4th Ct, there are several essays in L.A. Tritle (ed.), The Greek World in the Fourth Century: from the fall of the Athenian Empire to the successors ofAlexander (London/New York 1997), including one by R.J.A. Talbert on Sicily and S Italy. Timoleon is a constant source of scholarly fascination. M.R. Melita Pappalardo (Kokalos 42 [1996] 263-73) examines the propaganda in the earliest phase of his involvement in Sicily, while C. Mosse (Hommage Vallet, 249-56) warns against ascribing too readily all the revival of Sicily in the sec- ond half of the 4th Ct to Timoleon alone, and notes, as partial support, that Plutarch connects Timoleon's activities only with Syracuse. Hellenistic history has a new synthesis by G.Shipley, The Greek World after Alexander, 323-30 BC (London/New York 2000) (reviewed by I. Worthington, BMCR 01.03.11). Although the subject-matter of this book looks largely east- wards, there is much of use nevertheless for Sicilianists. On Sicily's relations with Egypt, we have two studies published in this period: E. Santagati Ruggeri (Kokalos 42 [1996] 275-81) turns to the Zenon archive for information regarding political, economic, and cultural contacts, and G. Manganaro (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 351-3) comments on the situation in general. On Agathokles, we have a new monograph by S.N. Consolo Langher, Agatocle (Messina 2000) (articles on particular topics contained therein have also been published in this period:</page><page sequence="12">156 FRANCO DE ANGELIS Kokalos 42 [1996] 237-62; Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 331-49). King Pyrrhus of Epirus' activities in Sicily have been investi- gated by E. Santagati Ruggeri, Un re tra Cartagine e i Mamertini: Pirro e la Sicilia [Seia vol. II.1] (Rome 1997). On the decorative and social roles of mosaics in Sicily's HL hous- es, there is an interesting paper by E. Chiara Portale (AISCOM IV, 85-106), and on the state of especially Western Sicilian mosaic studies we might also cite here M. David's contribution in Atti elimi III (357-67). Works spanning the A to HL periods can be mentioned here. On constitutions and institutions, there are four works to report: F. Sartori (II dinamismo, 43-57) gives us another update of his life-long interest in Western Greek constitu- tions; on assemblies, we can now turn to the overview by F. Ghinatti, Assemblee greche d'Occidente (Turin 1996); on gymnasiarchs, we have G. Cordiano, La ginnasiarchia nelle poleis dell 'Occidente (Pisa 1997); and on most of these areas, there is an article by F. Cordano (Sicilia epigraphica, 149-58). There are several other volumes dealing with liter- ary evidence and anc. authors: F. Carubia, Autori classici greci in Sicilia (Catania 1996); I. Concordia, La Sicilia anti- ca nellefonti letterarie I: gli abitanti e il territorio (Alcamo 1998); 'Su Diodoro Siculo: materiali per una discussione,' Mediterraneo Antico 1 (1998) 403-513; G. Avezziu and E. Pianezzola (eds.), Sicilia e Magna Grecia. spazio reale e spazio immaginario nella letteratura greca e latina (Padua 1999), as well as four more volumes of L. Braccesi (ed.), Hesperia: studi sulla grecita di Occidente VII, IX, X, XII (Rome 1996-2000) (some of the papers in these volumes are dealt with below). Land, sea and economics. P. Horden and N. Purcell's long-awaited Braudelian synthesis of the anc. and medieval Mediterranean has been published recently as The Corrupting Sea: a study of Mediterranean history (Oxford/Malden, MA 2000) (reviews by: G. Parker and P. van Dommelen, Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology 13 [2000] 226-36; G. Barker, Antiquity 75 [2001] 216-8; A.B. Knapp, AJA 105 [2001] 334-5). This is an indispensable work that will be consulted by anyone seriously interested in the historical geography of the Mediterranean. Another important general work deserving mention is the single-volume encyclopaedia of historical geography edited by H. Sonnabend, Mensch und Landschaft in der Antike: Lexicon der historischen Geographie (Stuttgart 1999) (reviewed by R.S. Bloch, BMCR 00.11.04). On Sicily's land and resources, one can turn to the excellent, but difficult to obtain, Linee: guida del piano territoriale, paesistico, regionale (Palermo 1996). On water management, we now have an excellent and up-to-date overview by R. Wilson (Cura aquarum, 5-36), as well as a collection of Sicilian case stud- ies by L. Ercoli (Cura aquarum, 57-67) (other site-specific papers amongst these conference proceedings are discussed below). The anc. Gr geographic tradition on Sicily is the focus of an article by F. Prontera (in P. Araud and P. Counillon (eds.), Geographica Historica [Nice 1998] 97-107). There has been much interest of late on earthquakes and volcanoes, to which natural forces the island was prone in antiquity, as today. The proceedings of a conference devoted to Sicilian earthquakes have appeared in G. Giarrizzo (ed.), La Sicilia dei terremoti: lunga durata e dinamiche sociali. Atti del convegno di studi, Universitd di Catania, Facolta di Lettere e Filosofia, ex Monastero dei Benedettini, Catania 11-13 dicembre 1995 (Catania 1997). Ancient views of earth- quakes are discussed in G. Waldherr, Erdbeben: das aufiergew6hnliche Normale. Zu Rezeption seismischer Aktivitdten in literarischen Quellen vom 4. Jh. v. Chr. bis zum 4. Jh. n. Chr. (Stuttgart 1997) (reviewed by H. Sonnabend, Gymnasium 106 [1999] 84-5, and H.M. Hine, Classical Review 49 [1999] 503-5). On volcanoes, we have the pro- ceedings of another conference published in N. Morello (ed.), Volcanoes and History: proceedings of the 20th INHIGEO symposium, Napoli, Eolie, Catania, Italy, 19-25 September 1995 (Genova 1998). C.F. Konrad (Historia 46 [1997] 28-63) shows convincingly that the coast and waters off W Sicily, with their stagnant and weedy characteristics, were the scene of an episode in a fragmentary papyrus involving Gaius Marius. The last twenty years of work on the character and uses of prehistoric and early historic Italian landscapes have been reviewed by G. Barker (Papers of the British School at Rome 67 [1999] 1-36). There is little in these pages on landscape archaeology projects in Sicily, and that is partly due the sec- ondary place to which such work has been relegated-an odd situation for an island famous for its agricultural capabilities and products. But the situation is changing for the better (see below under 'Southern Sicily' and 'Western Sicily'), and we can be sure that it will continue to change, as it is elsewhere in Italy (cf. most recently L. Quilici and S. Quilici Gigli (eds.), Campagna e paesaggio nell'Italia antica [Atlante Tematico di Topografia Antica vol. 8] (Rome 2000)), as a result of the pub- lication, in Italian, of valuable overviews of the methods and potential of landscape archaeology by O. Belvedere, the sea- soned Sicilian researcher, in Journal of Ancient Topography/Rivista di Topografia Antica 4 (1994 [1996]) 69-84, and F. Cambi and N. Terrenato, Introduzione all 'arche- ologia dei paesaggi (Rome 1994). Of the few general works relating to Sicilian Gr agriculture, we may cite the attempt by F. De Angelis (Papers of the British School at Rome 68 [2000] 111-48) to estimate the agricultural base of the island's main city-states in A and C times. One of his conclusions is that K.J. Beloch, the father of Sicilian historical demography, may have under-estimated the agricultural potential of the Gr sector of the island by about one-half. The article also contains some discussion of methodological problems and possibilities encountered in defining Western Greek territories. For fuller discussion of these issues, however, one should turn to the many articles from the Atti Taranto XXXVII volume cited ear- lier. Still in the sphere of settlement and territory, attention also needs to be drawn to two studies by M.H. Hansen dedi- cated to anc. Gr villages (komai) and emporia in, respectively, M.H. Hansen and K. Raaflaub (eds.), Studies in the Ancient Greek Polis [Papers of the Copenhagen Polis Centre vol. 2; Historia suppl. vol. 95] (Stuttgart 1995) 45-81, and T.H. Nielsen (ed.), Yet More Studies in the Ancient Greek Polis [Papers of the Copenhagen Polis Centre vol. 4; Historia suppl. vol. 117] (Stuttgart 1997) 83-105. Hansen makes the interest- ing observation that komai are not at all present in the anc. source material that survives for Sicily, or, for that matter, for any other area of Gr 'colonial' settlement. Also on emporia, particularly those on the S coast of Sicily facing Africa, there is a brief contribution by M. Gras in Studi Pelagatti (130-4). On political economy, especially in relation to Syracuse and its territorial ambitions between the 6th and 4th Cts BC, we can now turn to E. Galvagno, Politica ed economia nella Sicilia greca (Rome 2000), and on the economic function of the anc. Gr city in general, there is an interesting piece by J. Salmon, Greece &amp; Rome 46 (1999) 147-67. Moving on to crops, the late G. Nenci examines the often overlooked role played by millet in the diet of anc. Mediterranean peoples, and returns to the subject, which he has more fully explored elsewhere (ASNP 19 [1989] 1255-65), of the negative connotations that Sicilian Greeks intended when they called the native peoples of NW Sicily 'Elymians' (in D. Vera (ed.) Demografia, sis-</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 157 temi agrari, regimi alimentari nel mondo antico: atti del con- vegno internazionale di studi, Parma 17-19 ottobre 1997 [Bari 1999] 25-36). It might not be out of place here to mention the useful summary by C. Beltrame and G. Boetto (Archeologia Subacquea 2 [1997] 167-96) of millstones found in ship- wrecks or in isolation on the sea-bed. Various types and chronological periods are represented in this collection, and many of the specimens are published here for the first time. On the vine and viticulture amongst the A Western Greeks, we must welcome warmly the article by C. Vandermersch (Ostraka 5 [1996] 155-85), who does much to demonstrate the diversity of the region's economies. The author rightly ques- tions the idea that the Greeks brought the vine West, and con- siders the conditions, both natural and financial, needed to establish wine production. Apiculture is another area of eco- nomic activity that is sometimes too easily overlooked; the importance of the honey-bee in anc. Gr culture is underlined by F. Roscalla, Presenze simboliche dell'ape nella Grecia antica (Florence 1998). With respect to non-domesticated food sources, we have articles on hunting in W Sicily by C. Marconi (Atti elimi II, 1071-1120) and on representations of fauna and flora on coins, small bronzes, and rings by G. Manganaro (in E. Olshausen and H. Sonnabend (eds.), Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur historischen Geographie des Altertums 5, 1993: 'Gebirgsland als Lebensraum' [Amsterdam 1996] 215-22). (On economic exploitation beyond traditional agriculture, one can also refer to the paper on plants by M.-C. Amouretti, in M. Brunet (ed.), Territoires des cites grecques [BCH suppl. vol. 34] [Paris 1999] 357-69, and, more fully, to the just published volume by D.J. Mattingly and J. Salmon (eds.), Economies beyond Agriculture in the Classical World [London 2001]). The growing global interest of food and eating habits has not bypassed classical antiquity. S. Collin Bouffier considers the food culture of the Western Greeks as a component of their lux- ury (in J.-M. Luce (ed.), Paysage et alimentation dans le monde grec antique: les innovations du premier millenaire avant J.-C. Actes de la table ronde internationale (Toulouse- Le Mirail, 27-28 novembre 1998), forthcoming as a special issue of the journal Pallas). Along more general lines, we have two other works to note: P. Garsey, Food and Society in Classical Antiquity [Key Themes in Ancient History Series] (Cambridge 1999) (reviewed by D.J. Mattingly, JRS 90 [2000] 213-4), and G. Race, La cucina nel mondo classico (Naples 1999), consisting of annotated extracts from classical texts. Moving from land to sea, there is a collection of articles on Western Greek maritime life in F. Prontera (ed.), La Magna Grecia e il mare. Studi di storia marittima (Taranto 1996). One of the contributions is dedicated to fishing in Magna Graecia and Sicily (F. Trotta, 227-250). Articles discussing a variety of maritime themes can also be found in two volumes ofMEFRA 110 (1998) 7-192 and 111 (1999) 7-156, edited by C. Virlouvet. Deserving mention here is the contribution of S. Collin Bouffier (MEFRA 111 [1999] 37-50) on pisciculture (two other papers in these volumes pertain specifically to Sicilian subjects, and are discussed below). Fish and fishing in the anc. world have also been the subject of two recent vol- umes: A. Donati and P. Pasini (eds.), Pesca e pescatori nel- l'antichitd (Milan 1997-1999). The surviving verses of the poetry of Arkhestratos of Gela, largely but not entirely about fish, now have a new edition (based on a fresh examination of the manuscripts) accompanied by extensive philological and historical commentary: S.D. Olson and A. Sens, Archestratos of Gela. Greek culture and cuisine in the fourth century BCE: text, translation, and commentary (Oxford 2000). For those interested in swimming, a slim volume on the subject has been published by F. Maniscalco, II nuoto nel mondo greco-romano (Naples 1995) (cf. the brief notice in Archeologia Viva xix.83 [2000] 97). Ports, landings, and trade routes are the subject of a volume edited by G. Laudizi and C. Marangio, Porti, appro- di e linee di rotta nel Mediterraneo antico. Atti del seminario di studi, Lecce, 29-30 novembre 1996 (Galatina 1998). Also relevant in this connection is a recent work on the moder ports of Sicily: G. Simoncini (ed.), Sopra i porti di mare III: Sicilia e Malta (Florence 1997). Ancient seapower, from military, political, and economic points of view, is discussed by F. Montevecchi in II potere marittimo e le civiltd del Mediterraneo antico (Florence 1997). The complementary subject of piracy has now received the attention it deserves by P. de Souza, Piracy in the Greco-Roman World (Cambridge 2000) (reviewed by K. Simonsen, BMCR 00.10.30, and C. Ward, IJNA 29 [2000] 304-5). There is by the same author an article on thalassocracy in the early Gr world, in the volume edited by N. Fisher and H. van Wees, Archaic Greece. new approaches and new evidence (London 1998) 271-93. On the workings of trade and exchange, there are several studies to report. A. Schnapp (Hommage Vallet, 63-9) focuses on the Western Greek world, and concludes that, apart from conjec- ture, precise details are at present wholly lacking. C.J. Smith considers in particular the cultural baggage that accompanies trade and exchange (in G.R. Tsetskhladze (ed.), Ancient Greeks West and East [Leiden 1999] 179-206). L. Foxhall stresses that fashion and taste, and not just absolute shortage, played a role in the Mediterranean-wide movement of foodstuffs in A times (in N. Fisher and H. van Wees (eds.), Archaic Greece: new approaches and new evidence [London 1998] 295-309). Several important contributions can also be found in B.M. Giannattasio (ed.), Atti VII giornata archeologica. Viaggi e commerci nell'antichitd (Genova, 25 novembre 1994) (Genova 1995) (among the articles contained therein, note the pieces by M. Martelli [9-26] on luxury goods and power in the O period, and M. Cristofani [27-38] on prexis and organized trade). Some scholars have also returned to debating the existence of the pottery trade. R. Osborne (Antiquity 70 [1996] 31-4) argues in favour of its existence on the basis of variations in the patterns of Attic pottery imports to individual sites (C.J. Smith, in the article just cited, criticises Osborne for focusing too nar- rowly on economic rationality). M. Curry and J. Salmon also reach the conclusion that pottery was traded for its own sake (in G.R. Tsetskhladze et al. (eds.), Periplous: papers on classi- cal art and archaeology presented to Sir John Boardman [London 2000] 80-8 and 245-52). Some major works on the important subject of metal-work have appeared in the last few years. A conference on mining and metal-working in Italy was held in 1994, and published soon after in F. Piola Caselli (ed.), La miniera, l'uomo e l'am- biente. Fonti e metodi a confronto per la storia delle attivitd minerarie e metallurgiche in Italia (Florence 1996). Mining and metallurgical spheres in the Western Mediterranean between the 14th and 8th Cts BC have been examined by C. Giardino, II Mediterraneo Occidentale fra XIV ed VIII secolo a. C. Cerchie minerarie e metallurgiche [British Archaeological Reports International Series vol. 612] (Oxford 1995). This work has spurred its author to write an introduc- tory account of metals in the anc. world: Metalli nel mondo antico. Introduzione all'archeometallurgia (Rome/Bari 1998). On A Gr bronzes in Gr and non-Gr contexts, there is now the monograph by C.M. Stibbe, The Sons ofHephaistos. aspects of the archaic Greek bronze industry (Rome 2000). An attempt has also been made to assess the role metals played amongst the anc. Greeks by M.Y. Treister, The Role of Metals in Ancient Greek History [Mnemosyne suppl. vol. 156] (Leiden 1996), to</page><page sequence="14">158 FRANCO DE ANGELIS be read with the review by P.T. Craddock, JHS 119 (1999) 219-21. The commonly held belief that long-distance trade in metals led in large part to Phoenician and Gr overseas explo- ration and settlement is deflated considerably by a well-known authority in the field: J.D. Muhly, in S. Gitin et al. (eds.), Mediterranean Peoples in Transition: thirteenth to early tenth centuries BCE (Jerusalem 1998) 314-29. On Sicily in particu- lar, F. Jurgeit (Studi Pelagatti, 148-54) examines bronze vases from a burial obtained through the antiquities trade, and now in the Badisches Landesmuseum at Karlsruhe. Developments in myth and religion between 1993 and 1996 have been very thoroughly reviewed by N. Cusumano, Kokalos 43-4 (1997-98) 727-811. With one or two excep- tions, the aim here is to focus on works published since then. Readers interested in anc. Sicilian myth and religion will be pleased to learn that the first instalment of a new dictionary has appeared: G. Martorana et al. (eds.), Dizionario dei culti e miti nella Sicilia antica I: fonti letterarie (Palermo 1996). Similarly, a treasure trove of information is contained in F.-H. Massa-Pairault (ed.), Le mythe grec dans l 'Italie antique: fonc- tion et image. Actes du colloque international organise par l'Ecole Francaise de Rome, l'Istituto italiano per gli studi filosofici (Naples) et I'UMR 126 du CNRS (Archeologies d'Orient et d'Occident), Rome, 14-16 novembre 1996 [Collection de l'Ecole Francaise de Rome vol. 253] (Rome 1999). Sicily is the primary focus of two papers (by M. Mertens-Hor and A. Calderone), but one of the volume's great merits that it shows how myth crossed political and cultural boundaries with ease. This work provides the basis for discus- sion in the next generation. On the role of myth to mediate and form ethnic identities, we have two wonderful books by C. Calame, Mythe et histoire dans l'antiquite. La creation sym- bolique d'une colonie (Lausanne 1996), and I. Malkin, The Returns of Odysseus: colonization and ethnicity (Berkeley 1998) (reviewed by E. Cook, BMCR 00.03.22, and C.M. Antonaccio, American Journal of Philology 121 [2000] 637-41). On ethnicity more generally (including the role played by myth), we might also note here the excellent book by J.M. Hall, Ethnic Identity in GreekAntiquity (Cambridge 1997) (cf. the debates and reviews in Cambridge Archaeological Journal 8 [1998] 265-83, and S. Lewis, JHS 120 [2000] 191). In the area of religion, G. Manganaro (II dinamismo, 71-82) argues that native Sicilian religion had a minimal impact on Gr practices in the island, while G. Shepherd (Aeneas to Augustus, 55-70) demonstrates how the Sicilian Greeks used religion to express their identity. With regard to studies dedicated to deities, it is a pleasure to have a new monograph on the cult of Demeter and Kore by V. Hinz, Der Kult von Demeter und Kore auf Sizilien und in der Magna Graecia (Wiesbaden 1998). There are chapters reviewing the archaeological and written sources, and among the numerous conclusions drawn it is worth noting that the author questions the commonly held view that the expansion of the cult was largely due to the Deinomenids. The argument is that expansion was well under way from the mid-6th Ct BC, and a similar pattern of develop- ment in Gr S Italy cannot be explained in the same way as it is for Sicily. Chthonians in Sicilian inscriptions have been re- studied by J.B. Curbera (Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 38 [1997 (1999)] 397-408), who observes that the rarity of personal names derived from Demeter has nothing to do with ill omens, but with the male-dominated and elite nature of the written sources. On Hera cults across the anc. Gr world, we have the proceedings of a conference published in J. de la Geniere (ed.), Hera: images, espaces, cultes. Actes du col- loque international du Centre de recherches archeologiques de I'Universite de Lille III et de l'Association PR.A.C., Lille 29-30 novembre 1993 (Naples 1997). On Aphrodite, there is R.K. Schindler's unpublished doctoral thesis entitled 'The Archaeology of Aphrodite in the Greek West: ca 650-480 BC' (University of Michigan, 1998). J.B. Curbera (Philologus 142 [1998] 52-60) looks at river-gods and their onomastic impact, which was minimal. On sacred prostitution, not unknown in anc. Sicily, one can now consult G. Di Capua, Puttane degli dei. la prostituzione sacra presso i popoli antichi (Valentano 1998). C.M. Antonaccio examines the origins of hero cults in 'colonial' contexts (in R. Hagg (ed.), Ancient Greek Hero Cult: proceedings of the Fifth International Seminar on Ancient Greek Cult [Acta Instituti Atheniensis Regni Sueciae8 XVI] [Stockholm 1999] 109-21). On sacred space, I. Malkin ques- tions whether Greek sanctuaries, especially extra-urban ones, can be interpreted as signs of territorial domination and sover- eignty (in P. Hellstr6m and B. Alroth (eds.), Religion and Power in the Ancient Greek World [Uppsala 1996] 75-81), and G. Ragone examines sacred groves in the classical world (in C. Albore Livadie and F. Ortolani (eds.), II sistema uomo-ambi- ente: trapassato epresente [Bari 1998] 11-25). A. Cutroni Tusa, a leading authority in the field, has pre- pared a lengthy and detailed review of the Sicilian numismat- ic literature published between 1993 and 1996 (Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 625-700). That solid effort will not be repeated here; instead, the focus is to single out one or two notable items found in that survey and to highlight some works that have since appeared. From the pen of N.K. Rutter comes a general work on the coinages of Gr S Italy and Sicily (Greek Coinages of Southern Italy and Sicily [London 1997]). There is a distil- lation by Rutter of his book in F. Panvini Rosati, La moneta greca e romana (Rome 1999) 45-60. Also worth noting is T.R. Martin's attempt to discern the early need for coinage among the Greeks (Historia 45 [1996] 257-83). Numismatic enthusi- asts will also be happy to learn that G.E. Rizzo's still standard work Monete greche della Sicilia of 1946 was reprinted in 1997 by the publishing house Fori in Bologna. There is another reprint to note: N. Parise, La nascita della moneta: segni premonetari e forme arcaiche dello scambio (Rome 2000). Among the more specialized studies relating directly to Sicily, M. Caccamo Caltabiano (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 295-311) and N.K. Rutter (Aeneas to Augustus, 73-83) address questions of identity and uniqueness in Sicilian Gr coinage. A. Stazio (Hommage Vallet, 411-8) has traced through the coin evidence territorial control by the Gr city- states of S Italy and Sicily. On a related topic, Sicily's merce- nary coinage between Dion and Timoleon, there is D. Castrizio, La monetazione mercenariale in Sicilia: strategie economiche e territoriali fra Dione e Timoleonte (Soveria Mannelli 2000). For writing on coins, we have the ruminations of A. Cutroni Tusa (Sicilia epigraphica, 187-96). For new material, we can turn to two works: N.Vismara, La donazione Athos Moretti di monete dell'Italia antica (Etruria, Umbria, Samnium e Frentani), della Magna Grecia e della Sicilia anti- ca del Gabinetto Numismatico di Locarno (Locaro 1996), and an update by R. Calciati to his Corpus nummorum siculorum: la monetazione di bronzo (Milano 1983-1987) entitled Una collezione di monete di bronzo della Sicilia antica: primo aggiornamento critico al Corpus nummorum siculorum (Locaro 1995). Pottery studies have naturally been active. Of the gener- al works, we note the appearance of a third edition of R.M. Cook's standard text Greek Painted Pottery (London 1997). Six new general works have also been published, all of them containing a wealth of information: B. Sparkes, The Red and the Black: studies in Greekpottery (London 1996); R.M. Cook and P. Dupont, East Greek Pottery (London 1998); J. Boardman,</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 159 Early Greek Vase Painting: 11th-6th centuries BC (London 1998); J.-P. Crielaard et al. (eds.), The Complex Past of Pottery: production, circulation, and consumption of Mycenaean and Greekpottery (sixteenth to earlyfifth centuries BC) (Amsterdam 1999); M.-C. Villanueva et al. (eds.), Ceramique et peinture grecques: modes d'emploi. Actes du colloque international, Ecole du Louvre, 26, 27, 28 avril 1995 (Paris 1999); K. Rutter and B. Sparkes, Word and Image in Ancient Greece (Edinburgh 2000). There are also studies of individual classes of pottery to report. Two articles appeared in 1996 on Cycladic MG amphoras, both including discussion of the Sicilian finds: N. Kourou and N. Stampolidis, BCH 120 (1996) 705-19, and J.N. Coldstream, in E. Lanzillotta and D. Schilardi (eds.), Le Cicladi ed il mondo egeo. Seminario inter- nazionale di studi, Roma 19-21 novembre 1992 (Rome 1996) 171-86. Coldstream concludes that the Sicilian finds were heirlooms, while Kourou and Stampolidis leave open the pos- sibility that they may be pre-colonial. On Cor pottery produc- tion, we have three works. C. Morgan (Atti Taranto XXXIV, 313-44) addresses the problems and prospects of this area of study, emphasizing that families, and not 'the state', were responsible for production and circulation, and that workshops were small-scale and integrated into the agricultural cycle; S.P. Morris and J.K. Papadopoulos (Kontaktzonen, 251-63) argue that the Phoenicians played a large part in shaping the Cor pot- tery industry; and M. Shanks, Art and the Early Greek State: an interpretive archaeology (Cambridge 1999), dedicates a study to the meaning of PCor pottery (reviewed by N. Papalexandrou, AJA 105 [2001] 120-2). On Attic pottery, we now have the published proceedings, in CdA 29-30 (1990-91 [1996]) (edited by F. Giudice), of the Sicilian conference men- tioned in the previous report (AR 1995-96, 65). Fourth-centu- ry Attic imports in the West are investigated in B. Sabattini (ed.), La ceramique attique du 4e siecle en Mediterranee occi- dentale. actes du colloque organise par le Centre Camille Jullian, Arles, 7-9 decembre (Naples 2000). It is also worth- while noting here the publication of another conference held in Milan on the archaeometry of bg wares: P. Frontini and M.T. Grassi (eds.), Indagini archeometriche relative alla ceramica a vernice nera: nuovi dati sulla provenienza e la diffusione (Como 1998). Megarian bowls in Italy have been the subject of a monograph by P. Puppo, Le coppe megaresi in Italia [Studia Archaeologica 78] (Rome 1995) (reviewed by S.I. Rotroff, Journal of Roman Archaeology 9 [1996] 316-320). On transport amphoras and their distribution, we are thankful to P. Pelagatti (Atti Taranto XXXIV, 403-16) for an overview of the Cor material from Sicily, to R.F. Docter (Kontaktzonen, 359-73) for the distribution of the so-called 'ZitA-Amphoren' (some examples have been found at Megara Hyblaia, Motya, and Mylai), and to R.M. Albanese Procelli (Kokalos 42 [1996] 91-137; RA [1997] 3-25) for broader studies involving the full range of Greek transport amphoras (including Western Greek) from Sicily. C. Vandermersch (BdA 99 [1997] 1-12) devotes a study to depictions of Western Greek transport amphoras on rf pottery. In addition to the Western Greek transport amphoras studies just mentioned, there have also been important and welcome developments in the study of Siceliot pottery produc- tion, especially in regard to delineating styles: A. Siracusano, QuadMess 9 (1994 [1996]) 49-61, and several works by M. Denti (Studi Orlandini, 205-21; Atti Taranto XXXVII, 777-83; in M.-C. Villanueva et al. (eds.), Ceramique et peinture grec- ques: modes d'emploi. Actes du colloque international, Ecole du Louvre, 26, 27, 28 avril 1995 [Paris 1999] 323-6). We may also note here the lengthy paper by U. Spigo in Atti Taranto XXXIV (551-84) on the impact of Cor art on Sicily, and the shorter but equally insight one by C. Isler-Kerenyi (Studi Orlandini, 195-203) reminding us of the diversity of anc. Greek art. S. Vassallo (Quaderni del Museo Archeologico Regionale 'Antonio Salinas' 2 [1996] 91-113) studies the typology and distribution of Iato K480 cups, concluding that their origins are to be placed in Himera in the last decades of the 6th Ct BC. U. Spigo (Studi Gullini, 175-95) focuses on the 'cultura pittorica' of the Lipari Painter and his Group (such as the Cefalui Painter), and a study by A. De Filippis on the work of the Cefalu Painter attested at Kyme in S Italy (Rivista dell'Istituto Nazionale d'Archeologia e Storia dell'Arte 19-20 [1996-97] 21-47). There are also publications of larger and less homogenous collections of pottery. The Attic and Siceliot pottery from Catania's Museo Civico di Castello Ursino has been published by S. Barresi and S. Valastro, Vasi atticifigu- rati, vasi sicelioti (Catania 2000). M.L. Ferruzza and C.A. Nero (Archeologia e territorio, 417-45) have published the private collection of Marquis A. De Gregorio, naturalist and palaeontologist, who died in 1930. The collection consists of 892 items and includes small bronzes, glass, terracottas, coins, and pottery of various kinds (Etruscan, Cor, Attic, bg, and so on). Another private Sicilian collection has been published by M.A. Mastelloni et al. (eds.), Enrico Pirajno di Mandralisca: umanita, scienze e cultura in una grande collezione siciliana (Palermo 1997). There are two items of Siceliot rf by the Group of Syracuse and the Adrano Group in the work by O. Tugusheva, Corpus vasorum antiquorum: Russia III: Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow (Rome 1997). Also rele- vant is the catalogue of another collection of largely Italiote rf by A. Cambitoglou and J. Chamy, Ceramique de grande Grece. La collection de fragments Herbert A. Cahn (Zurich 1997). In preparation is vol. 72 of the Corpus vasorum antiquorum: Italia: Siracusa, Museo Archeologico Regionale by F. Zisa (Rome). The preceding works provide new fodder for those interested in iconography, as does the publication in 1997 of volume VIII of the series Lexicon iconographicum mythologiae classicae containing 'Thespiades-Zodiacus' and a supplement on 'Abila-Thersites'. To be noted is the piece by R.J.A. Wilson on 'Trinakros' (55). Also by Wilson is a wide- ranging study of the origins and meaning of Sicily's triskeles symbol on various types of artefacts, not just pottery (Cambridge Archaeological Journal 10 [2000] 35-61). Wilson demonstrates, among other things, that the Sicilians anthropomorphized this solar symbol by turning the hooks into legs. P. Jacquet Rimassa (Pallas 42 [1995] 129-65) devotes an article to iconographic representations of the Sicilian game kot- tabos in Italiote rf pottery. Sculpture and Terracotta. The most spectacular sculp- tural find to report is the HL bronze statue, possibly of Aeolus, netted in the Sicilian Canal by Italian fishermen in 1998, and subsequently sent to Rome for restoration after a brief period of residence at Mazara del Vallo (R. Giglio, Archeologia Viva xviii.69 [1998] 72-6; A.L. Slayman, Archaeology 51.3 [1998] 21). The statue's exact find-spot is being kept secret by the archaeological authorities for fear of illegal plundering, but is said to have been retrieved from a depth of about 400m. The piece is fragmentary, with both arms and feet and one leg miss- ing, but what survives is at least 1.63m in height. The bone inlays of the eyes are intact, but the pupils, almost certainly made of another material, have disappeared. This discovery was made too late for inclusion in N. Bonacasa's (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 259-73) overview of HL figural art in Sicily, particularly sculpture and terracottas, where the calibre of local workshops and their influences (mostly Alexandrian) are dis- cussed. Sculptural representations in vase-painting are exam- ined in detail by M. Cesare, Le statue in immagine. Studi sulle raffigurazioni di statue nella pittura vascolare greca (Rome</page><page sequence="16">160 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 1997). The Sicilian examples are four in number and all date to the period of Timoleon. With respect to terracottas, we can begin by noting the pub- lication of two museum collections. The first collection is of A and C material from the Castello Ursino museum at Catania: A. Pautasso, Terrecotte archaiche e classiche del Museo Civico di Castello Ursino a Catania (Catania 1996). This body of material is made up of two separate collections which original- ly belonged to Prince Biscari and the Benedictine fathers, and thus, like most such collections, often (but in this case not invariably) lack information in regard to provenance and con- text. Nevertheless we have here the publication of several classes of material (architectural sculpture, lamps, bronzes, pottery, etc.) which, on the whole, dates from the mid-6th Ct BC to the end of the C period. Pautasso is to be commended for making this material available, since, of the two collec- tions, only the Biscari had previously seen any publication, and then only as part of general catalogues by G. Libertini in the 1930s. The final chapter in her book (113-48) uses the mate- rial that she publishes as the springboard for a wider discussion of Sicilian terracotta production in the A and C periods. The other collection is part of an ongoing museum project, with the most recent contribution by P. Pensabene, Terracotte del Museo Nazionale Romano I: gocciolatoi e protomi da sime (Rome 1999) (reviewed by N.A. Winter, BMCR 00.09.15). Although most of the material contained in this volume per- tains to central Italy in LHL and R times, there is much rele- vant information for comparative and historical purposes. On architectural terracottas, there are two studies by P. Danner, Westgriechische Firstantefixe und Reiterkalyptere (Mainz 1996), and Westgriechische Akrotere (Mainz 1997) (the latter work is authoratatively reviewed by B. Barletta, AJA 103 [1999] 364-5). Sicilian clay sarcophagi have been thoroughly studied by C. Bonanno, I sarcophagifittili della Sicilia [Studia Archeologica vol. 91] (Rome 1998) (reviewed by A. Precopi Lombardo, SicArch xxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 241-2). One of the most important conclusions to emerge from this work is that the specimens from Kamarina, on the basis of trace element analysis, are of local manufacture, and not from Gela, as had been previously believed. Some Sicilian incense-burners are included in the monograph by C. Zaccagnino, II thymiaterion nel mondo greco [Studia Archeologica vol. 97] (Rome 1998). Also worth mentioning here is the article on early Greek light- ing practices (and often by extension terracotta lamps) by E. Parisinou, Oxford Journal of Archaeology 17 (1998) 327-43. Among the last of the late L. Bernab6 Brea's published works is a study comparing the comic masks of (particularly) Lipari and other Sicilian and S Italian sites with those described by Iulius Pollux in his Onomastikon: Le maschere ellenistiche della tragedia greca [Cahiers du Centre Jean B6rard vol. 19] (Naples 1998), with the collaboration of M.T. Lanza Carpino and A. De Filippis Rendina. The conclusion is that almost all the types found in this anc. writer can be recognized amongst the material finds. ROMAN There are two handy surveys of things R to note: in Kokalos 43-44 (1997-98) 555-72, R. Soraci discusses certain develop- ments in the history of R Sicily between 1993 and 1996, and in JRS 86 (1996) 170-89, E. Curti, E. Dench, and J.R. Patterson review recent archaeological developments for Central and Southern R Italy. The focus here will be mainly on develop- ments that have occurred since the publication of these sur- veys, beginning with the more general archaeological and historical works. E Zevi (Hommage Vallet, 315-43) traces the origins of the Siculi/Latini myth to the arrival of the first Sicilian grain shipments to Rome in the time of the tyrant Gelon, exploring as well the important mark they left on R reli- gion and eating habits. On the First Punic War and its imme- diate aftermath, we have articles by R. Marino (Kokalos 42 [1996] 365-72) on the just war in myth and practice, and J. Serrati (Aeneas to Augustus, 115-33) on the creation of Sicily as Rome's first province. R cultural and military penetration in Sicily in the 3rd Ct BC, with particular reference to Morgantina and Entella, is the topic of an article by M. Mattioli (Acme 48 [1995] 5-21). Sicily figures throughout, sometimes promi- nently, in five recent accounts of Republican history: C. Badel and A. B6renger, L'Italie et la Sicile d'Hannibal d Octavien (218-31 avant J.-C.). textes et documents (Paris 1994); N. Belayche, Rome, lapeninsule italienne et la Sicile (de 218 d 31 avant notre ere): crise et mutations (Paris 1994); P. Erdkamp, Hunger and the Sword. Warfare and Food Supply in Roman Republican Wars (264-30 BC) (Amsterdam 1998) (reviewed by J. Serrati, JRS 90 [2000] 222-4); J.-M. David, The Roman Conquest of Italy (Oxford 1997) (translated by A. Nevill from the original French edition of 1996), and by the same author, La Rpublique romaine de la deuxieme guerre punique a la bataille d'Actium 218-31: crise d'une aristocratie (Paris 2000). The passages of Diodoros relating to the 2nd-Ct-BC slave revolts have been edited and commented on by L. Canfora and M. Stefani Montecalvo, Diodoro Siculo: la rivol- ta degli schiavi in Sicilia (Palermo 1999). R.J.A. Wilson (Aeneas to Augustus, 134-60) compares Cicero's account of Sicily during the 1st Ct BC with the archaeological evidence, revealing the former to be highly rhetorical. On Sicily during the R empire, there is another lovely little work by Wilson with excellent photographs published as a supplement to Kalos 4 (1997), as well as a forthcoming Italian edition of his Sicily under the Roman Empire: the archaeology of a Roman province, 36 BC-AD 535 (Warminster 1990). There is also a book just published in Italian on the archaeology of all the R provinces: S. Rinaldi Tufi, Archeologia delle province romane (Rome 2000). Some of A. Pinzone's articles have been revised and reprinted in Provincia Sicilia: ricerche di storia della Sicilia romana da Gaio Flaminio a Gregorio Magno (Catania 1999). There has been much activity on LR Sicily. Two confer- ences have been devoted to this period: the IXth Palermo con- ference published in Kokalos 43-44 (1997-98) 1-491 (some of the articles will be treated in this section, and others elsewhere in this report), and the Catania-Patern conference on the more narrow theme of religion and society published in R. Barcellona and S. Pricoco (eds.), La Sicilia nella tarda anti- chita e nell'alto medioevo: religione e societa (Soveria Mannelli 1999). Another LR contribution worth noting is E. Caliri's (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 471-82) attempt to place Sicily in the period of Gregory the Great into its Mediterranean-wide context. The subjects of immigration and Romanization have attracted considerable attention as well. A. Pinzone and C. Anastasis (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 381-402, 403-14) consider the general implications of immigration into Republican Sicily, while G. Sfameni and L. De Salvo (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 355-80, 447-57) focus more particularly on eastern cults and contacts. On Romanization, there are four articles devoted specifically to Sicily by K. Lomas (Aeneas to Augustus, 161-73), A. Pinzone (Atti elimi III, 849-78), C. Mole (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 415-38), and I. Bitto (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 483-93), and three more general works of rel- evance: N. Terrenato, in C. Forcey et al. (eds.), Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference (Oxford 1998) 20-7; E. Fentress (ed.), Romanization and the</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 161 City: creation, transformation, and failures (Portsmouth, RI 2000); R. MacMullen, Romanization in the Time of Augustus (New Haven 2000). Developments in epigraphy have been digested by L.Bivona (Sicilia epigraphica, 113-27; Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 613-24, covering the years 1993-96; Atti elimi III, 153-66); M. Sgarlata (Sicilia epigraphica, 483-97) on the ECh material; and L'Annee Epigraphique 1995 (1998) 219, nos. 687-8; 1996 (1999) 253-62, nos. 786-811; 1997 (2000) 256-9, nos. 733-40. We can also note two more recent contri- butions that have since appeared: L. Bivona (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 439-45) on the epigraphic connections between N Africa and Sicily, and G. Bevilacqua, S. Giannobile, and D. Jordan, ZPE 133 (2000) 135-48 on magic inscriptions from Noto and Modica, and more generally by G. Bevilacqua (Sicilia epigraphica, 65-88). On coinage, note the appearance of A. Burett et al., Roman Provincial Coinage. supplement I (London/Paris 1998), of which pp. 13-14 are dedicated to Sicily. I. Bitto (Sicilia epigraphica, 89-111) devotes a study to writing on coins. M. Caccamo Caltabiano (Atti elimi III, 199-216) stud- ies R provincial coinage in W Sicily, finding little centralized policy. Turning to settlement studies, there is a stimulating piece on ideology and building in early Imperial Sicily by O. Belvedere, in L. Quilici and S. Quilici Gigli (eds.), Architettura e pianificazione urbana nell'Italia antica [Atlante Tematico di Topografia Antica vol. 6] (Rome 1997) 17-24, and another item by the same author on urbanism in Journal of Ancient Topography/Rivista di Topografia Antica 8 (1998 [2000]) 111-20. One can find discussion of Sicilian sites amongst the thematic chapters in the book by S.P. Ellis, Roman Housing (London 2000) (reviewed by T. O'Sullivan, BMCR 00.10.09). A very helpful review of research on aqueducts and water-supply in the R world, including Sicily, is provided by R.J.A. Wilson, Journal of Roman Archaeology 9 (1996) 5-29. The proceedings of a confer- ence mainly dedicated to R rural settlement in Sicily announced in the previous report (AR 1995-96, 66) have been now been published as a special issue of the journal Aitna 2 (1996). O. Belvedere returns to and amplifies some- what an earlier article on the contribution of field-survey to R rural settlement in Sicily (cf. AR 1995-96, 66) in R. Farioli Campanati (ed.), XLIII corso di cultura sull'arte ravennate e bizantina. Seminario internazionale di studi sul tema: 'Ricerche di archeologia e topografia' in memoria del prof. Nereo Alfieri, Ravenna, 22-26 marzo 1997 (Ravenna 1998) 33-59. On rural and coastal villas in Sicily, we have the first thoughts of E. Cilia Platamone (in M. Khanoussi et al. (eds.), Africa romana XIII: atti del XIII convegno di studio, Djerba 10-13 dicembre 1998 [Rome 2000] 1405-12). On a related topic, E. Joly (AISCOM IV, 33-8) studies opus signinum in Sicily. There are also various papers of relevance, though none directed specifically at R Sicily, in Du latifondium au latifondo: un heritage de Rome, une creation medievale ou moderne? Actes de la table ronde internationale du CNRS organisee a l'Universite Michel de Montaigne-Bordeaux III les 17-19 decembre 1992 (Paris 1995). G. Uggeri (Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 299-364) and L. Di Paola (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 459-69) focus attention on land and sea travel; the former writer observes that the impact of the R road-system in Sicily was not as great as in other regions, but at the same time calls for further study. The bridges along Sicily's via Valeria have been discussed by G. Pipit6 (Journal of Ancient Topography/Rivista di Topografia Antica 6 [1996 (1998)] 197-210). On pottery, we have studies on Naxian wine amphoras in N Africa (J. Freed and R.J.A. Wilson, AJA 103 [1999] 268), and on the production and distribution of local and imported LR wares (R.M. Carra Bonacasa, Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 377-95). On lamps, E. Joly studies Sicilian copies of African lamps from the Museo Archeologico Regionale in Palermo (in L. Bacchielli and M. Bonanno Aravantinos (eds.), Scritti di antichitd in memoria di Sandro Stucchi II [Rome 1996] 95-9), and M.G. Branciforti (CdA 31 [1992 (1997)] 93-105) provides a much-needed and welcome study on the lamps of the AFYPI- NAIOI. This work focuses primarily on chronology and distri- bution, and publishes for the first time thirty-nine examples from museums in Catania and Syracuse. Four stylistic groups are distinguished, and most of the finds are attested in the Centuripe-Agira-Assoro-Troina-Catania area (no example has been identified outside the island). The author suggests that a branch of this workshop may have been set up in Catania, the region's commercial hub. We might also add here R.J.A. Wilson's study (Sicilia epigraphica, 531-51) of writing on var- ious sorts of HL-R clay products. BYZANTINE AND LATER MEDIEVAL Positive developments in the fields of Byz and later Med archaeology have continued (cf. AR 1995-96, 66, 99, 102, 118), and include the appearance of several introductory and synthetic works. On Byz archaeology, there is now the intro- ductory work, containing frequent mention of Sicily, by E. Zanini, Introduzione all'archeologia bizantina (Rome 1994); each chapter is devoted to a specific theme (history of the dis- cipline, written sources, cities, and so on), the final one a plea for expanding the range of questions and approaches in Byz archaeology, a theme which the author has also pursued in other writings: in Byzantium: image, identity, influence (Major Papers for the XIXth International Congress of Byzantine Studies) (Copenhagen 1996) 437-41, and in CNAMI, 20-4. In a similarly reflective vein, C. Wickham (Archeologia Medievale 26 [1999] 7-19) reviews the last twenty years of EMed archaeology in Italy. There is yet another handbook on Med archaeology as a whole (including Byz) by another lead- ing light in the field, S. Gelichi, Introduzione all'archeologia medievale: storia e ricerca in Italia (Rome 1997). On the Arabs in Sicily, we have a very lucid synthesis by F. Maurici, Breve storia degli Arabi in Sicilia (Palermo 1999), and a monograph on Arab elements in island's place-names by A. Di Gregorio, Arabi, lingua e costumi alle origini della civilta siciliana (Catania 1999). The nine papers of a confer- ence organized by l'Ecole Francaise de Rome on castles and power in Sicily from the emirs to the barons have been pub- lished in J.-M. Poisson (ed.), MEFRM 110 (1998) 549-771. On the Normans, both in Sicily and outside, we have a new book by M. Chibnall, The Normans (Malden, MA 2000). Several works have also appeared on the Jewish presence in Sicily. A handy collection of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew testi- monia is provided by C. Gebbia, Presenze giudaiche nella Sicilia antica e tardoantica [Kokalos suppl. vol. 11] (Rome 1996) (cf. the positive comments of R. Soraci, Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 565). Three other works can also be noted: M. Cioe, Le radici semitiche della Sicilia (Syracuse 1996); S. Simonsohn, The Jews in Sicily, 2 vols. (Leiden 1997-2000); N. Bucaria (ed.), Gli Ebrei in Sicilia dal tardoantico al medioevo: studi in onore di mons. Benedetto Rocco (Palermo 1998). The nature and development of Med settlement in Sicily has been an area of discussion and debate. In G. Noy6 and R. Francovich (eds.), La storia dell'alto medioevo italiano (VI-X secolo) alla luce dell'archeologia (Florence 1994), there are</page><page sequence="18">162 FRANCO DE ANGELIS articles by A. Molinari (361-77) and J.M. Pesez (379-85) on town and country. The controversial topic of incastellamento is addressed by both authors, who express doubts as to whether this was ever a feature of the Byz landscape in Sicily. In the year following the publication of this volume, F. Maurici (Archeologia Medievale 22 [1995] 487-500), a supporter of incastellamento in Byz Sicily, responded to Molinari and Pesez, and amplified his case for the existence of the phe- iT : nomenon. It is interesting to note that Pesez's (381) call for excavations at Monte Kassar . (Castronovo di Sicilia) to test Maurici's identifica- tion of the site, from surface reconnaisance, as a '. Byz fortress has indeed been heeded, revealing evidence that supports Maurici's position (for fur- ther details, see 'Western Sicily' below). On EMed necropoleis in Sicily, an area obviously .j related to the latter questions, L. Arcifa rounds up the present evidence and suggests some possible 1. Syracus future directions for research (in G. Bermond Montanari et al. (eds.), XIII International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences V: the Roman period in the provinces and barbaric world [Forli 1998] 59-68). Elsewhere in settlement studies, H. Bresc explores the origins of the Med latifundium in Du latifondium au latifondo: un her- itage de Rome, une creation medievale ou moderne? Actes de la table ronde internationale du CNRS organisee a I'Universite Michel de Montaigne-Bordeaux III les 17-19 decembre 1992 (Paris 1995) 273-87. The field of epigraphy has also received some attention in this period. Three valuable overviews have appeared amongst the Sicilia epigraphica proceedings: A. Guillou (385-91) on Byz and post-Byz epigraphy, M.A. De Luca (197-204) on Arab epigraphy, and S. Simonsohn (509-29) on Jewish epigra- phy. SOUTHEAST SICILY Provinces of Syracuse and Ragusa For Syracuse we may begin with the general works relating to the city and territory. Various aspects of the region's geog- raphy in the Gr period have recently been investigated. In par- ticular, we should note R. Mirisola and L. Polacco, Contributi alla paleogeografia di Siracusa e del territorio Siracusano (VIII-V sec. a.C.) [Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti. Memorie, Classe di Scienze Morali, Lettere ed Arti vol. 66] (Venice, 1996). The authors argue that the marshlands around anc. Syracuse were more extensive than previously believed, and that the third river which impeded the Athenian retreat of 413 BC is not the Tellaro, which is too far S, but the present Gioi-Laufi which has subsequently diminished in size consider- ably. In the final two chapters, they put together a picture, using various kinds of evidence, of the roads that connected Syracuse to its dependent settlements in the hinterland, particulary those to the W and S. On aqueducts and hydrology in anc. Syracuse, there are three contributions in the Cura aquarum proceedings (D.P. Crouch, 47-56; L. Guzzardi, 97-101; R. Ruggieri et al., 103-4). On the river Ciane and its papyri, there is a study by B. Corrado, 11 Ciane e i suoi papiri: storia di un flume [Quademi dell'Associazione Istituto Intemazionali del Papiro, Siracusa, vol. 2] (Casoria 1994), which appeared simultaneously in English translation as The Ciane River. over the centuries a myth and a goal.

Di Natale, I1 museo del papiro di Siracusa [Quademi dell'Associazione Istituto Intemazionali del Papiro, Siracusa, vol. 4] (Syracuse 1994). On the major sites of SE Sicily from PR to R times, there is the most welcome book by G. Voza, Nel segno dell 'antico. archeologia nel territorio di Siracusa (Palermo 1999), which discusses in particular Thapsos, Pantalica, Villasmundo, Megara Hyblaia, Syracuse, Heloros, the R villa at Tellaro, Akrai, and Kasmenai, at many of which he himself has exca- vated. This well-illustrated work also includes a colourful pho- tographic essay on the Museo Archeologico Regionale Paolo Orsi, in which the finds from these sites are housed. It is also worth noting that, at various points in the text, Voza underlines the importance of archaeology as a source of evidence, given the paucity of written sources, and need to avoid Hellenocentric interpretations. Also by Voza is an article on the history of archaeological research on anc. Syracuse between 1861 and 1915 (in S. Adorno (ed.), Siracusa: identita e storia: 1861-1915 [Palermo 1998] 249-60). The results of this past scholarship are revisited in light of later develop- ments, and some of the key illustrations that accompanied those old publications are helpfully reproduced. For those interested in older representations of anc. Syracuse and region, still of value especially for topographers, there is a veritable feast in the catalogue of a baronial collection: P. Beneventano del Bosco (ed.), Siracusa urbs magnificentissima. La collezione Beneventano di Monteclimiti (Milan 1995). The 1928 third edition of L. Giuliano, Storia di Siracusa antica has been reprinted by Flaccovio in Palermo. On Syracuse's foun- dation-period, an 8th-Ct native Sicilian spearhead dedicated at the Cor sanctuary at Isthmia is thought to have been acquired in a violent encounter with the natives (in C. Morgan, Isthmia VIII: the Late Bronze Age settlement and Early Iron Age sanc- tuary [Princeton 1999] 161-2). On later history, there are two works by S.N.

Trevett (ZPE 106 [1995] 246-8), who argues convinc- ingly that Nikias was the Syracusan proxenos at Athens, which provides further insight into the relations between the two cities on the eve of their confrontation. Turning to the HL peri- od, there are some new studies on coins to report. M. Ierardi (American Journal of Numismatics 7-8 [1995-96] 1-73) examines the tetradrachms of Agathokles; M. Caccamo Caltabiano and others examine the coinage of Hieron II in Siracusa ellenistica: le monete 'regali' di Ierone II, della sua famiglia e dei Siracusani (Messina 1997); and G. Manganaro, in Rivista Italiana di Numismatica e Scienze Affini 100 (1999) 79-92, looks at various things in the coin room of the Syracuse museum. We might also mention here two final items on the technological feats during the time of Hieron II. In a persua- sive article, J. Macintosh Turfa and A.G. Steinmeyer Jr. (IJNA 28 [1999] 105-25) argue that the literary sources mentioning the massive cargo vessel Syracosia are not exaggerated. Such a vessel, weighing in the region of more or less 3,000-4,000 tons, could have existed. The ship, they also argue, was prob- ably cannibalized for materials shortly after it was given as a gift to Ptolemy III, thus explaining the lack of later references to it in the anc. sources. The other technological feat involves the BBC-led attempt to recreate the iron claws developed by Archimedes to pull ships out of the water during the R siege of the city, an event which, of course, attracted considerable attention from the local press (cf. La Sicilia for Saturday, 14 August 1999, p. 12). A respectable showing was made thanks to much perserverance and patience, together with the support of numerous volunteers and scholars (among them R.J.A. Wilson, the previous compiler of these reports, in his usual fine form), but this exercise in experimental archaeology cannot be said to have solved the riddle of Archimedes' technology. Archaeological work undertaken in various sectors of the anc. city includes that at Ortygia, where there are some excit- ing new discoveries to report. In the early 1990s the opportu- nity arose to excavate in Piazza Duomo, which the Syracuse Superintendency quickly seized and promptly published (cf G. Voza (ed.), Siracusa 1999. lo scavo archeologico di Piazza Duomo [Palermo 1999]; G. Voza, Studi Di Vita, 131-8; G. Voza, Nel segno dell'antico: archeologia nel territorio di Siracusa [Palermo 1999] 81-8). Another stretch of a N-S road has been found, providing further confirmation that Gr Ortygia had a regular town plan. This road formed the S boundary of a sacred area, whose entrance was flanked with a monumental pylon. The excavations were able to reach bedrock and found that the oldest material above it belongs to the EBA (Castelluccian) and MBA (Thapsos). 'Two pits of these PR periods contained pottery and animal bones (pig, cow, sheep/goat), indicating activity of a religious nature, which has continued into modem times. Of the Gr period are the foundations of two temples (Fig. 1). One of the temples is 16.2 x 10.5m, and dates to the 7th/6th Cts BC, and below it is the other one, 9.2 x 6m and dating to the 8th Ct BC. The latter structure is of the simple oikos variety with altar, and perhaps in antis columns. Fragments of Thapsos cups and Euboian pottery have also been recovered. New excavations have also taken place in the Prefettura, close to the site of earlier work by P. Pelagatti in 1977-1980 (C. Ciurcina, Studi Pelagatti, 86-91; cf. AR 1981-82, 87) (Fig. 2). In the small- scale excavations, the anc. layers span PR to HL-R times. Part of another stenopos has been found, and the earliest associated pottery is of the 6th Ct, causing its excavator to wonder if it was not in use as early as those found by Pelagatti. A 12m-long stretch of wall, made up of blocks as long as 1.25m, may belong to a 6th-Ct public building, perhaps a stoa. 2. Syracuse: Prefettura excavations Another public building of a religious nature is suggested by the discovery of a votive pit containing, among other things, animal bone and pottery of the 7th and 6th Cts. The existence of yet another nearby sacred area is suggested by F. Fouilland (Studi Pelagatti, 115-8) in publishing the early 6th-Ct fragments of 'Wild Goat Style' pottery dumped into a disused well (this is material brought to light during P. Pelagatti's excavations in the Prefettura). Elsewhere on Ortygia, the Ionic temple found in 1960 underneath the Palazzo Vermexio has been revisited briefly in F. Costabile et al., L'architettura samia di Occidente dalla cava al tempio: Siracusa, Locri, Caulonia (Soveria Mannelli 1997) 19-23. This re-study reinforces many of the facts already known about this temple, while adding a few new ones. The temple, which appears never to have been finished (judging from two partly-finished column drums) is very poorly preserved, possibly dismantled in antiquity with the building of the nearby Athenaion now incorporated into the Cathedral. The surviving architectural elements suggest that it was built in the last decade of the 6th Ct BC. None of the stylobate's blocks was found in situ, but its measurements were probably ca 22 x 25m. The columns may have stood to a height of about 12.5m, and there seems to have been a double colonnade along the front, with columns comprising 28 and 32 flutings. No stance is taken on temple's interior and on the divinty to whom the temple was consecrated. From Acradina we have the re-study by M. Mertens-Horn (Studi Pelagatti, 324-35) of fragmentary marble sculpture found by P. Orsi (NSc [1915] 197-8), who connected it with the presence of a small A sanctuary in the vicinity. Mertens- Horn dates all the pieces to 480-470 BC and identifies the var- ious figures as having been part of a large group depicting the abduction of Kore. L. Karlsson (Opuscula Romana 21 [1996] 83-7) has inter- preted Hieron II's monumental altar in the Neapolis as the cen-</page><page sequence="20">164 FRANCO DE ANGELIS tre of religious activity connected with the general assembly, made up of representatives sent from the various subject cities. He also argues that the altar was consecrated to Zeus, and prob- ably built along with Hieron II's rebuilding of the nearby the- atre, with which it is closely associated, in 238 BC. The older finds from Syracuse's necropoleis continue to receive new attention. R.M. Albanese Procelli (Studi Pelagatti, 32-8) focuses on the elite rite of secondary crema- tions in bronze lebes attested in small numbers in various of anc. Syracuse's necropoleis between the late 8th and 6th Cts BC. After describing the rite and accompanying grave-goods, Albanese Procelli finds parallels with Homeric burial practices also found at several other Gr sites and explains the divergence from the burial practices of mother-city Corinth by interaction in a new world and the need to belong to a wider aristocratic group. R. Frederiksen focuses on the burials with PCor pottery in the Fusco necropolis in G.R. Tsetskhladze (ed.), Ancient Greeks West and East (Leiden 1999) 229-65. He finds few patterns in the distribution of grave-goods, though notes that the graves tend generally to become wealthier with the passing of time, reflecting the increasing prosperity of the city as a whole. Frederiksen also observes that the number of graves diverging sufficiently from those of Corinth is not very high, and could be explained as due simply to different ritual behav- iour. D. Palermo (CdA 31 [1992 (1997)] 23-34) re-examines an ivory fibula with a winged female figure discovered by P. Orsi in the tomb (no. CXXXIX) of a young woman in the Fusco necropolis (cf. NSc [1895] 119-20). He begins by argu- ing that the illustrations accompanying the original publication are rather fanciful, and that the fibula, although often men- tioned in passing in scholarly works, has not received the full attention it deserves. Palermo dates the fibula to the last quar- ter of the 7th Ct BC and argues that comparanda for its iconog- raphy, depicting Artemis and a goat, can be found in Crete. But since that island does not appear to have a major ivory-work- ing area, Palermo hypothesizes that it was by a Cretan crafts- man working at one of the Artemis Orthia workshops at Sparta, although he is hesitant to eliminate altogether the pos- sibility that it was made on Crete. The different stylistic influ- ences discernible in the Syracusan specimen could be explained by the international nature of this industry. How the fibula got to Syracuse is unknown, yet Palermo underlines its uniqueness in A Gr Sicily, and by extension the tomb in which it was deposited. The ECh community at Syracuse has also received some attention in this period. On Pagans and Christians in the 3rd and 4th Cts AD, there is the work by R. Greco, Pagani e cris- tiani a Siracusa tra il 3. e il 4. secolo d.C. [Kokalos suppl. vol. 16] (Rome 1999). On the Adelfia catacombs and sarcophagus, we have the catalogue of an exhibition shown in Syracuse in 1998-99: G. Greco et al., Et lux fuit: le catacombe e il sar- cofago di Adelfia (Syracuse 1998), and on the iconography of wall paintings and mosaics more generally in Syracuse's ECh burials, one can now turn to A. Ahlqvist, Pitture e mosaici nei cimiteri paleocristiani di Siracusa: corpus iconograhicum [Istituto Veneto di Scienze. Memorie della Classe di Scienze Morali, Lettere e Arti vol. 56] (Venice 1995). Evidence for BA and EIA native settlement in the region of later Gr Leontinoi has been very helpfully assembled and dis- cussed by F. Valenti, Lestrigonia: insediamenti preistorici nel territorio dell'antica Leontini (Catania 1994). On the initial Greek-native encounter at Leontinoi and neighouring Megara Hyblaia, there is a re-examination of the question by R. Sammartano (Seia 11 [1994] 47-93) comparing the written and archaeological sources. This is an insightful and rich study, with numerous novel conclusions and suggestions. Among them we may note the following. Sammartano questions the value of Thucydides' statements regarding Greek-native rela- tions at early Leontinoi, arguing that the archaeology paints a picture of cordial co-existence till the end of the 7th Ct BC. The same position is also maintained for Syracuse. For Megara Hyblaia, the archaeology supports Thucydides' claims for good Greek-native relations, but Sammartano suggests that this ini- tial goodwill gave way to violence, as Megarian territorial expansion brought to an end life at the native sites of Villasmundo and Pantalica. He also comments on the written sources: Antikhos had a pro-Doric stance, while Ephoros and Polyainos were pro-Athenian and pro-Khalkidian. We also have another contribution on Leontinoi as a magnet for refugees, which of course has interesting implications for the study of material culture, by G. Vanotti who focuses on the 5th Ct BC, in M. Sordi (ed.), Coercizione e mobilitd umana nel mondo [Contributi dell'Istituto di Storia Antica dell'Universita del Sacro Cuore vol. 21] (Milan 1995) 89-106. Moving now to archaeological case studies, we have the just-published study (which I have yet to see) on the city's for- tifications by S. Rizza, Studi sulle fortificazioni greche di Leontini (Catania 2000). There is also the full publication of a season of excavation in the rupestrian settlement in contrada Caracausi located NE of modem Lentini, about 2km S of the road for Agnone, for years known for its lost coin hoard and burial ground (L. Grasso et al., CdA 28 [1989 (1996)]). Excavation focused mainly on six rooms cut into the rock. The oldest material belongs to the A and C periods, and consists of various ceramic productions, including 41 fragments of Attic bf and bg pottery, three fragments of ECor and LCor pottery, three fragments of Lakonian craters, and fragments of various transport amphoras. The best known phase of occupation, per- haps reflecting the site's most important moment, is the centu- ry spanning the mid-4th to mid-3rd Cts BC, to which belong such things as locally made and imported pottery, terracottas, lamps, and loomweights. The work also revealed four Med burials (13th-14th Cts) accomapanied by pottery. Closer to anc. Leontinoi itself, there is the re-study of tomb 105 in the San Mauro necropolis, which A.D. Trendall dated to about 320 BC, but which A. Montironi (CdA 31 [1992 (1997)] 61-6) thinks is excessively low, with accompanying implica- tions as well for the dating of Pagenstecher lekythoi. This is yet another instance of Trendall's chronology taking little account of the necropolis' stratigraphy. The grave-goods found in the tomb firmly date it to the first half of the 4th Ct BC. Montironi seeks further support by examining the origins and contexts of other Pagenstecher lekythoi discovered in Sicily, and finds, moreover, that a Sicilian origin for this lekythos is likelier than a Campanian one. On the city's terracotta pro- duction, which is still too little known, there is a thorough study of 220 fragments (belonging to probably 180 different statuettes) of the 4th and 3rd Cts BC by M. Frasca (BdA 91 [1995 (1996)] 1-24). The material derives from houses in con- trada Crocefisso, and consists of various types. The nearby Byz grottos have also been studied in this period by A. Romeo, Gli affreschi bizantine delle grotte del Crocifisso di Lentini [Quademi del Gruppo Archeologico Catanese] (Catania 1995), with a briefer account in Archeo xi.6 (1996) 98-105. The archaeology of the territory of Augusta has been given an important boost with the publication of two works, both intended as contributions towards what Italian archaeologists call 'la carta archeologica' (a gazeteer of anc. sites). One is the first instalment of an ongoing series by I. Russo et al., Augusta e territori limitrofi I: preistoria: dal paleolitico superiore alla precolonizzazione [Archivio Storico Siracusano suppl. vol. 5] (Syracuse 1996). This work, dedicated to prehistory, represents</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 165 the efforts of three scholars from the region, who, in addition to discussing material already known, have included some new sites. The latter belong mainly to the LR and Byz periods, when the region was densely occupied with small settlements, and for the time being they can be found in the second more general work by R. Lanteri, Augusta e il suo territorio: elementiper una carta archeologica [Distretto Scolastico 58] (Catania 1997). This fine little volume, illustrated with numerous colour photo- graphs, incorporates the valuable testimonies provided by old maps and local histories that are extremely difficult to access. These two new works provide good background reading for the foundation of later Gr Megara Hyblaia, and of the region gen- erally during classical antiquity. There are no new excavations to report from Megara Hyblaia. Instead, efforts have concentrated on two areas: pub- lishing previously excavated material, and studying further what is already in the public domain (in this regard Hommage Vallet is particularly important). On the publication pro- gramme, brief reports by M. Gras can be read in Magna Grecia (Cosenza) xxxi.1-3 (1996) 12-4, MEFRA 108 (1996) 478-80, and MEFRA 109 (1997) 482-4 (cf. also Gras, in M. Meyer and I. Roda (eds.), Ciudades antiguas del Mediterraneo [Barcelona 1998], 118). As is only to be expected, several of the new stud- ies are devoted to settlement development. F. Villard (Hommage Vallet, 133-40) argues that each of the early settle- ment's blocks was divided into four lots, thus giving every set- tler a kleros of 750-800m2 which was further subdivided into equal plots as the family developed. In another study on initial land division, H. Treziny (Hommage Vallet, 141-83; cf. AJA 101 [1997] 381) concludes that the guiding principle was also egalitarian. On the development of religious space, we have a highly interesting piece of the sort we have come to expect from F. De Polignac (Hommage Vallet, 209-29), who hypothesizes that the agora only became the central religious focus of Megara Hyblaia in the second half of the 7th Ct. In the preceding cen- tury, the various population nuclei, or quarters, that made up Megara Hyblaia each had its own local cult area, in order to avoid centralization, and hence maintain social equilibrium, in what appears to be a mixed population. On the use of space in the W necropolis, there is a study by A. Iacovella (Archeologia e Calcolatori 8 [1997] 67-102). On the port area, there is an interesting piece by M. Gras on how inhabitants from nearby Augusta came to the ruins of anc. Megara Hyblaia in the mid-13th Ct AD to obtain drinking water and building stone (in C. Nicolet (ed.), &lt;Alla signorina&gt;&gt;. melanges offerts a Noelle de la Blanchardiere [Collection de l'Ecole Francaise de Rome vol. 204] [Rome 1995] 141-66). Gras argues that these Med people drew their water from an anc. fountain of the 6th Ct BC close to the A fortifications. These anc. remains had been interpreted in the past as a 6th-Ct artificial port by P. Orsi and as a HL portico by F. Villard and G. Vallet, but their new identification seems to be the strongest. We might also mention here the wide-ranging article by P. Danner comparing the urban development of Megara, Megara Hyblaia, and Selinous, who puts forward a variety of cultural, economic, and political factors to explain the similarities and differences in their trajectories (in H.D. Andersen et al. (eds.), Urbanization in the Mediterranean in the 9th to 6th centuries BC [Acta Hyperborea vol. 7] [Copenhagen 1997] 143-65). On art and myth, F.-H. Massa-Pirault (Hommage Vallet, 103-19) examines some of the fragmentary figure-scenes on the local polychrome pottery produced in the second half of the 7th Ct, and finds represented the myths of Alkathoos and the Kithairon lion, the Argonauts, and Jason and Medea. In the territory of anc. Megara Hyblaia, the spectacular site of Pantalica continues to receive attention. The Myc impact on the formation of the Pantalica North culture is revisited by M. Cultraro, who adds little to what is already known, in N. Negroni Catacchio (ed.), Protovillanoviani e/o protoetruschi. ricerche e scavi. Atti del terzo incontro di studi, Manciano- Farnese, 12-14 maggio 1995 (Florence 1998) 301-12. For the period of the Athenian expedition against Syracuse, D. Palermo (CdA 31 [1992 (1997)] 55-9) argues in a short but stimulating note that the battle at 'Akraion Lepas' narrated by Thucydides (vii.78-9) took place on the Filiporto saddle at Pantalica. Among the arguments used to support his case, Palermo draws attention to the big C trench excavated by L. Bemab6 Brea and to the survival of the name Akrai/on in later times, including ultimately the Med name by which the site is known today. The name Akrai/on had been given to the site in the first place, he further argues, by the nearby Syracusan out- post of that name which was probably responsible for bringing to an end the native settlement. The PR necropoleis at Pantalica are connected with those at Cassibile, further to the S, for the establishment of SE Sicily's LBA and EIA cultural and chronological sequence. In this regard, therefore, it is not out of place to mention here that P. Orsi's excavations in the necropoleis have been restudied by C.M. Turco, La necropoli di Cassibile (scavi Paolo Orsi 1897 e 1923) [Cahiers du Centre Jean Berard vol. 21] (Naples 2000). Among the results obtained, we should note that Turco suggests that the necropolis was in use for a century more than usually thought, from approximately 1000-750 BC, and that little social differentiation existed in the burials. Closer to Pantalica, there is also some new material of later periods: a LR necropo- lis from around Sortino has been discovered (B. Giaccotto, Aitna 3 [1999] 139-47), and from Priolo-Gargallo, some 15km to the E, a LR hypogeum dated to the first three quarters of the 5th Ct (E.G. Picone, QuadMess 9 [1994 (1996)] 141-63). Moving to the territory of anc. Syracuse, we have a won- derful article by L. Guzzardi and B. Basile on Cape Pachino, the peninsula to the S of the anc. metropolis, which forms one of the three points of the island, and a beacon for anc. sea-trav- ellers (in F. Prontera (ed.), La Magna Grecia e il mare. Studi di storia marittima [Taranto 1996] 189-226). New explorations and the study of older ones continue to advance our knowledge of Kamarina, the splendid anc. city on the island's SE coast (cf. AR 1995-96, 69-73). The results of the new explorations, in both town and country, have been presented by G. Di Stefano in two articles (Studi Di Vita, 194-212; Studi Pelagatti, 276-87). In 1996, two more sacella (labelled A and B) and a fifth altar were found to the E of the Timoleontic stoa on the upper agora; the altar is rectangular (3.35 x 1.75m). Sacella B and C measure 4 x 8m and 3.5 x 7.5m respectively; in both cases, walls are 0.5m thick. The area behind the W stoa, constructed in the mid-5th Ct BC, where the previously-discovered fountain has now been com- pletely uncovered, could have been the meeting-place for the assembly. This was followed by the above-mentioned reli- gious structures and stoa in the last quarter of the 4th Ct. Elsewhere work is also under way in the W sector of the city along plateia B. More excavations have taken place beyond the city wall in the surrounding countryside between the rivers Hipparis and Oanis. Part of an anc. road and a fountain reservoir have been revealed and tentatively identified as some kind of roadside rest area. Two new farmsteads have also been discovered. One of them is located at Kastalia some 265m N and 210m E of the previously known farmsteads at, respectively, lurato and Capodicasa (Fig. 3). The Kastalia farmstead is of 4th-Ct-BC</page><page sequence="22">166 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 3.

Kamarina, contrada Menta: farmstead date, and is perfectly aligned with the Capodicasa one, and, like it, part of the same land redistribution scheme. The other farmstead is located in contrada Menta, some 7km from the city, in the E part of Kamarina's territory (Fig. 4). The site had already been visited by the clandestini, prompt- ing the Ragusa Superintendency to step in in 1996. The farmstead is made up of four rooms spread over two build- ings measuring 14 x 8m and 13 x 5m. The simple stone masonry is 0.7-0.8m in thickness. On the basis of the finds, room A has been identified as the kitchen, and rooms B and D for living and storage space; signs of domestic cult were found in room B. The farmstead dates to the late 5th/early 4th Cts BC; rooms E and F were added in the Timoleontic peri- od, and have a similar orientation to the other known farm- stead closer to the city. Of the studies deriving from older explorations, we may begin with P. Pelagatti's (Studi Di Vita, 173-90) tackling of various issues in the chronology of the 6th and 5th Cts. She con- cludes that there is no need to raise Kamarina's foundation- date because of the earlier amphoras re-used for burials, and raises the possibilities that the agora sacred area could have extended beyond plateiai A and B, and that the N quarter of the city, particularly the housing blocks not far from the river Hipparis between streets C and D, may date to the democratic regime installed in the city in 461 BC. On the part played by water in the history of Kamarina, we may turn to a work by F. Cordano and G. Di Stefano, in S. Quilici Gigli (ed.), Uomo, acqua e paesaggio (Rome 1997) 289-300; on aspects of the same topic, see other studies by Di Stefano in Cura aquarum, 231-9, International Journal of Anthropology 13.3-4 (1998) 195-9, and in S. Pesavento Mattioli (ed.), Bonifiche e drenaggi con anfore in epoca romana: aspetti tecnici e topografici. Atti del seminario di studi, Padova 19-20 settembre 1995 (Modena 1998) 265-73. A. Di Vita (Studi Pelagatti, 104-9) has published a new piece of architectural sculpture, the bust of a kore, found in 1961 near the SW corer of the temple of Athena. The bust is preserved, from waist to lower neck, to a height of 0.5m, and none of its left arm and only part of its right arm survive. On its roughly-worked back is a deep cutting whose only purpose could have been to secure the piece to the temple's W pedi- ment, which would have been visible from the sea. Di Vita dates this fragmentary kore to the period of Timoleon, and hypothesizes that the complete piece would have stood to a height of 1.6m. F. Giudice, along with V.G. Rizzone (Studi Pelagatti, 301-14), returns to Kamarina's Attic imports, updating and amplifying an earlier study (cf. AR 1995-96, 73). Some of these imports derive from the Passo Marinaro necropolis, which now has a guide by G. Di Stefano, Camarina: guida alla necropoli di Passo Marinaro (Ragusa 1997). We might also note that a major collaborative effort between Italian and French institutions to publish already-excavated burial evi- dence from Kamarina and Castiglione di Ragusa is under way (cf. J.-C. Sourisseau, MEFRA 112 [2000] 471-2). The study of Kamarina's epigraphy keeps moving for- ward. The lead tablets from the temple of Athena have attract- ed the attention of two notable scholars: B Helly (PdP 52 [1997] 365-406) investigates phratries, and 0. Murray ration- ality (in M.H. Hansen (ed.), The Polis as an Urban Centre and as a Political Community: Symposium August, 29-31 1996 [Copenhagen 1997] 493-504). Two new contracts have also been published by F. Cordano and A. Di Vita (PdP 52 [1997] 355-64). There is also a note by F. Cordano (Studi Di Vita, 191-3), the noted epigraphist of Kamarina, on the city's histo- ry between 461 and 405 BC. The challenges in site preservation that the archaeological authorities have encountered over the last century are dis- cussed in G. Di Stefano and P. Pelagatti, Camarina: cento anni di paesaggio storico (Palermo 1998). On Kamarina's 'carta archeologica', there is a brief contribution by G. Di Stefano in B. Amendolea (ed.), Carta archeologica epianificazione terri- torale: un problema politico e metodologico. Primo incontro di studi, Roma, marzo 1997 (Rome 1999) 213-8. On the stor- age and display of the finds from Kamarina in the local anti- quarium, also see the longer piece by Di Stefano (SicArch xxxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 209-31). Impressive finds continue to be made in the waters off Kamarina (cf. AR 1995-96, 70-3). Another 6th-Ct bronze hel- met of Corinthian-Illyrian type has been discovered near the Punta Braccetto wreck site by two sport divers who immedi- ately brought it to the attention of the Ragusa Superintendency (G. Di Stefano, Archeologia Viva xix.84 [2000] 17). Another chance discovery by a diver in 1999 has revealed a new R shipwreck, whose exact location the authorities are judiciously keeping quiet (G. Di Stefano, Archeologia Viva xix.84 [2000] 86-8). Recovered so far are several stunning bronze objects, including two containers, three lamps, and a statuette of Mercury, after whom the wreck has been dubbed (Figs. 5-7). One of the lamps is of Campanian manufacture, and another Egyptian. The objects are dated to the late 1st/early 2nd Cts AD. All these new discoveries will need to be added to G.

Di Stefano, Cava d'Ispica: i monumenti (Palermo 1997). We also have an introduction by Di Stefano to a reprinting of a 1905 work written by P. Orsi, under the pseudonym 'Siculus', for a newspaper on his travels in the area: Paolo Orsi, Cava d'Ispica, paesaggio siciliano (Ragusa 1996). On Modica, just to the W, the work by S. Minardo, Modica antica: ricerche topografiche, archeologiche e storiche (Modica 1952) has been reprinted with corrections by G. Raniolo on behalf of Modica's Edizioni Associazione Culturale 'Dialogo'. For developments in the archaeology of Modica since the publi- cation of Minardo's book we can now turn to papers in Archeologia negli Iblei by V.G. Rizzone and A.M. Sammito (15-26) and G. Di Stefano (109-14), which is more narrowly focused on the Byz period, as well as to another work by Sammito on the topography of Modica's hypogea (Aitna 3 [1999] 149-60). At Scicli to the SW, there are two more contributions in Archeologia negli Iblei, the first, by P. Militello (47-62) sur- veying the known evidence from the EBA down to the arrival of the Greeks, and the other by E. Militello (63-108) restudy- ing the substantial 19th-Ct coin collection of G Pacetto, a local cleric. The latter study helpfully brings together all the mate- rial in a single work, material which Pacetto had published in various scattered publications now difficult to obtain. Some recent work has also been done on the 'Tre Cantoni' castle (G. Di Stefano and S. Fiorilla, CNAMI, 92-6). On Ragusa to the N, there is a brief history of archaeolog- ical exploration in the urban centre (G. Di Stefano, Archeologia negli Iblei, 7-13). The only new discovery to report comes from contrada Camesala, 7km to the SW, where some LR tombs, including a single-burial arcosolium, have been found in a topographic survey (M. Canzonieri, Aitna 3 [1999] 161-72). On Comiso to the NW we have yet another guidebook by G. Di Stefano, Comiso antica: guida archeologica (Palermo 1999), as well as a brief note on the R imperial bath-building and Arab Cuba (Archeologia negli Iblei, 27-30). R. Arena (Atti elimi III, 41-6) has underlined the Elymian connections in the inscription on the Ionic B2 cup, discussed in the previous report (AR 1995-96, 74), from the native site of Castiglione di Ragusa just outside Comiso. From this same site comes a truly spectacular discovery: namely, the so-called 'guerriero di Castiglione' (or 'Castiglione warrior') uncovered by a local farmer during deep ploughing in a field around the anc. site (G. Di Stefano, G. Voza and F. Cordano, Archeologia Viva, xviii.77 [1999] 78-81) (Fig. 8). The piece is sculpted in a local opaque white limestone with the figures in low relief and full tondo, and combines Gr and native artistic traditions. The middle portion shows a horse whose mid-section is cov- ered with a round shield held by a henchman, part of whose left leg can be discerned between the round shield and horse's front legs. Above the shield is the warrior's head. The ends of the piece have a bull's head and part of its body, and possibly the hind section of a sphinx. An early 6th-Ct inscription in four lines, found just beneath the horse's nose, contains in retro- grade the name of the dedicant IIYPINOI in the dative with his</page><page sequence="24">168 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 8. 'Guerriero di Castiglione' father's name IYTIKA in the genitive. These names are accompanied by another, I9YAOI, indicated as the craftsman. The alphabet may be of Peloponnesian origin judging from the names. The 'guerriero di Castiglione' is a fascinating new dis- covery, whose importance cannot be overemphasized; it is sure to cause future debate. On Scornavacche, close to Chiaramonte Gulfi, some 1 Okm to the NE, there are three articles from the Festschrift for A. Di Vita, its excavator in the 1950s. R. Gafa (Studi Di Vita, 257-64) revisits the habitation area uncovered by Di Vita, and argues, on the basis of personal autopsy, that the site is proba- bly a little larger (about 5-6ha) than presently thought, contin- uing westwards beyond the expropriated area. E.C. Portale (Studi Di Vita, 265-82) argues that the well-known terracottas from the site date not to the period of Timoleon, but to the peri- od of Dionysios I, and makes the further general point that archaeological material is sometimes too easily and mechani- cally ascribed to Timoleon. The preliminary results of archaeometric work on Scomavac-che's pottery are briefly presented in L. Lazzarini's con- tribution (Studi Di Vita, 283-90), which reveals that local clays were used for many of the prod- ucts. On the margins of Ragusa province, still fur- ther to the N, we have the final publication of the well-known excavations conducted at the native settlement on Monte Casasia in 1966, 1972, and 1973 (F. Fouilland, M. Frasca, and P. Pelagatti, NSc 5-6 [1994-95 (1996)] 323-583; cf. BTCGI x.296-300). This material, as rightly observed by its publishers, will be invaluable in helping to define further the Licodia Eubeafacies. The loca- tion of the settlement accompanying the excavated tombs is still not certain, although it is thought that it may have lain on the highest plateau. The set- tlement's origins have been investigated by M. Frasca (Studi Di Vita, 143-7), who underlines its strategic situation and connects its establishment MARE with the foundation of Kasmenai, the Syracusan outpost. Frasca also draws attention to the Khalkidian influences in the pottery and wonders whether Leontinoi competed with Syracuse and Gela to have the upper hand in this strategic area. With the foundation of Kamarina on the coast, however, the cultural focus of native Monte Casasia shifts in that direction. G. Di Stefano (AISCOM IV, 199-21) has devoted a study to the mosaics in the R imperial villa at Giarratana and the Byz chapel at Kaukana. For the latter site, we also have a new guidebook: P. Pelagatti and G. Di Stefano, Kaukana: il chori- on bizantino (Palermo 1999) and an attempt to identify the function of its various buildings (G. Di Stefano, Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 463-91). The buildings adhere to one of two plan types: simple or complex, the former consisting of buildings of one or two rooms, and the latter of numerous rooms with court- yard and apsidal end (Fig. 9). On the basis of parallels from Syria and N Africa, building 22 is identified as a palazzo, and building 19 as a public building, perhaps a bazaar. Buildings 9. Kaukana: site</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 169 la, Ib, 3a, 4, 5, 6, 9, 14, 15, and 16, which consist of both sim- ple and complex plan, are identified as houses. Buildings 2, 7, 8, 17, and 20 are thought to have served as both residence and commerical/work quarters. There is little regular planning at Kaukana, with the exception of buildings 2, 7, 8, and 17, which are aligned with the chapel (no. 18 on the plan). The areas between the various buildings were probably planted with trees and gardens, a supposition which was strengthened after a sea- son of excavation in 1996 in these open areas. From the earlier excavations in the emporium site at con- trada Maestro (cf. AR 1987-88, 116), we have the publication of an inscription of the 6th Ct BC (possibly the second half) recording the selling of a certain quantity of grain (F. Cordano, PdP 52 [1997] 349-54). This is an important document which provides further testimony to the vibrant grain trade in which Gr Sicily was involved. In the Monti Iblei as a region, new EBA (Castelluccian) sites are discussed by G. Di Stefano, in R. De Marinis et al. (eds.), XIII International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences IV: the Copper Age in the Near East and Europe (Forli 1998) 211-8. A current overview of Greek-native relations can be con- sulted in Civilitd indigene e cittd greche nella regione iblea [Distretto Scolastico di Ragusa] (Ragusa 1996) (non vidi). There are also articles on various aspects of the classical histo- ry of the Monti Iblei in Studi Di Vita, by G. Pugliese Carratelli (125-7), G. Manganaro (149-54), F. Trotta (155-60), and L. Agostiniani (161-72). On the Med period, we have two brief summaries of the region's Byz villages: A. Messina and G. Di Stefano, CNAMI, 116-9; G. Di Stefano, in G. De Boe and F. Verhaeghe (eds.), Urbanism in Medieval Europe: papers of the 'Medieval Europe Brugge 1997'conference (Zellik 1997) 35-8. Thus far 21 villages are known; generally, they are open settlements of several hectares with little or no regular planning. NORTHEAST SICILY Provinces of Messina and Catania On the general works relating to anc. Catania, there is a wealth of information amongst the conference proceedings published in B. Gentili (ed.), Catania antica: atti del convegno della S.I.S.A.C. [to wit, 'Societa italiana per lo studio dell'antichita classica'] (Catania 23-24 maggio 1992) (Pisa/Rome 1996) (reviewed by A.J. Dominguez, BMCR 98.1.28, and M. Pagano, Aitna 3 [1999] 194-6). This most welcome work focuses pri- marily on the Gr and R periods, and considers both written and archaeological evidence for the city and its wider relations. One of the topics discussed is urbanism, which for the Gr peri- od has also been addressed elsewhere by M. Frasca (Studi Pelagatti, 119-25) in a summary of earlier excavations in the ex-Benedictine monastery (cf. AR 1987-88, 117), the likely location of the anc. acropolis. The hill appears to have been unoccupied at the time of settlement, which occurred rapidly over an extensive area, judging from pottery finds. Three NE-SW running walls follow the hill's contour. The empty spaces between them could indicate dispersed settlement, but the limited extent of the excavations might be misleading. Remains of small simple houses of the mid-6th-Ct BC were also found (Fig. 10). They may have been decorated with the tiles and palmette antefixes retrieved in their environs. There is also evidence for a possible sanctuary in the vicinity of these houses. On Catania's monuments and urban development, we might also note two more general works, the first a reprint of a 10. Catania: 6th-Ct houses still helpful history of the city by F. Ferrara, Storia di Catania sino alla fine del secolo XVIII con la descrizione degli antichi monumenti ancora esistenti e dello stato presente della cittd (Catania 1829), reprinted in S.G. La Punta (CT) by Gruppo Editoriale Brancato-Clio-Biesse-Nuova Bietti in 1993, and the other a work by S. Correnti and S. Sparta, Le strade di Catania. la storia, i segreti, l'arte, ilfolclore della cittd attra- verso una completa guida alfabetica delle sue vie e delle sue piazze... (Rome 1999). On the coastal topography of Catania and area, there is a note by E.F. Castagnino (IJNA 23 [1994] 49-52), who argues that the modem place-names of Ognina and Porto Ulisse are located on their anc. equivalents. The author also calls for proper underwater research in the port of Catania itself, where over the years numerous anc. finds have come to light through dredging and various other activities. One of the more note- worthy finds that has received renewed attention in the period under review is the marble group of Herakles and Antaios found by divers during dredging operations in 1927 and pub- lished shortly thereafter in a small article by G. Libertini (Rivista del Reale Istituto di Archeologia e Storia dell'Arte 1 [1929] 287-92). In an article devoted to the iconography of this marble group, A. Pautasso (CdA 31 [1992 (1997)] 83-91) builds on Libertini's study in the light of subsequent develop- ments, arguing that the Catania group ultimately derives from a 2nd-Ct-BC model from Pergamum. Of the new work in Catania, there is little to add to the report for the previous period. A volume of the project to pub- lish the votive deposit from the sanctuary of Demeter at Catania (mentioned in AR 1987-88, 117) has appeared: L. Grasso, Stipe votiva del santuario di Demetra a Catania. koty- lai e coppe corinzie figurate (Catania 1999) (non vidi). Excavations have also continued in the R theatre (cf. AR 1995-96, 74), and there are some more details to add to the previous report (M.G. Branciforti, AJA 101 [1997] 372). The work that has been under way since 1991 involves a complete</page><page sequence="26">170 FRANCO DE ANGELIS redrawing of the monument and systematic excavations in the orchestra. This work has uncovered that the pulpitum was dec- orated with fine sculpture and that the orchestra's floor con- sisted of marble pavement in opus sectile. Work on the scae- naefrons has shown that it too was decorated with fine archi- tectural elements. Future work on the theatre will, reportedly, focus on the E parados and the postscaenium. Elsewhere Branciforti (AISCOMIV, 165-98) has collected and studied all the known R imperial mosaics from Catania. Moving outside Catania, but still in the R period, we turn to the bath-building, once belonging to a villa, just to the W of the city at nearby Misterbianco. To this monument F. Tomasello returns (CdA 31 [1992 (1997)] 117-22; cf. AR 1987-88, 117), providing newer plans and reconstructions (on the basic features of the building, see also R.J.A. Wilson, Sicily under the Roman Empire: the archaeology of a Roman province, 36 BC-AD 535 [Warminster 1990] 210-1). Tomasello dates the main part of this structure, on the basis of its construction techniques, to the end of 2nd/beginning 3rd Cts AD, and its N extension about a century later. The author also notes that the building's plan followed a grid and suggests that the entire residential complex to which it belonged may have followed this grid pattern. There has been some new work on the wider Etna region as a whole. We may begin with the catalogue of an exhibition in Catania in 1997 on the natural and human history of the area: Etna: mito d'Europa (Catania 1997). A clay bust of a female figure from the Adrano Museum has been published by G. Falco in Numismatica e Antichita Classiche: quaderni tici- nesi 25 (1996) 83-96. The bust came into the Museum's pos- session in 1963 after being uncovered during agricultural work in nearby contrada Fossa dell'Aglio; it was found in a grave along with a lamp, duck askos, bronze grater, and trefoil-lipped oinochoe. The female figure, possibly representing Persephone, is wearing chiton and himation. The clay is a nutty red colour rich in micaceous inclusions; traces of an ivory-coloured slip also survive. The bust dates to the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC, and the workmanship can be closely paralleled with examples from Medma-Locri in S Italy. The parallels are so close that Falco suggests that pilgrims brought back to Sicily votives which were reproduced and/or reinter- preted locally. The R aqueduct around Paterno has been re-studied by G. Lamagna et al., Acquedotto romano: tratto ricadente nel terri- torio di Paternd (Santa Maria di Licodia 1997). This work contains a valuable collection of moder scholarly accounts of the aqueduct, comprising both in-passing and in-depth treat- ments, as well as an overview of the aqueduct's features and date. The more recent work on it by the Catania Superintendency aims to re-study the entire structure, includ- ing the re-discovery of previously known stretches (for exam- ple, the remains recently found again on the Corso Indipendenza in Catania), and to protect any of its remaining visible stretches from disappearing altogether. As for the aque- duct's date, little more than hypothesis can be advanced in the absence of excavation. Nevertheless, it seems safe to say that it was originally constructed in the Augustan period in con- junction with Catania being made a Roman colony, and repaired in the 3rd Ct AD, judging from an inscription men- tioning curatores found close to one of the aqueduct's cisterns in the 19th Ct. On the other side of Mt Etna, in the lovely Fiumefreddo valley, there is a handy guide on the natural and human histo- ry (including discussion of architectural and archaeological matters) by D. Boso et al., Fiume Fiumefreddo: riserva natu- rale orientata: geologia, flora, fauna, comuni, archeologia, architettura, itinerario (Turin, 1999). Further to the S, R mate- rial has been uncovered at two sites, probably farmsteads, located at Trecastagni and Viagrande some 10-12km NE of Catania (cf. A. Patane, CdA 31 [1992 (1997)] 123-33). The Viagrande site consists of two surface scatters in contrada Sciarelle and contrada Poio (covering areas of, respectively, 3,500m2 and 5,000m2). The environs of these scatters are today planted with the vine, and presumably viticulture would have been an anc. drawing feature as well. The Trecastagni site located in contrada Tremonti is about 5km to the W of the latter. Surface work has revealed occupation from the 1St Ct BC to the 6th/7th Cts AD. Among the finds are some bronze coins of the late 2nd/early 1St Cts BC, and a stamp with the let- ters CHRES on the base of a cup, the product of a workshop active in Carthage in the Flavian period. Patane calls for future excavation to supply further and more exact details, including more archaeological work in general on this region N of Catania. On the Catania Superintendency's work in the Etna region and further afield, there is a valuable overview by M.G. Branciforti (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 241-8). A second season of excavation was carried out at Valverde in 1995 and more of a wall found in 1989 was uncovered. The wall is dated no later than the mid-6th Ct BC; less certain is its cultural milieu: was this a native settlement with Gr influences, or a Gr site? The answer may eventually lie in some tantalizing data retrieved in this second season. Other walls of a slightly later date found at a higher altitude on the site are of an entirely different orienta- tion and make one think of some kind of radical cultural trans- formation. Archaeological investigations have also taken place at another hill-top located close by on Monte S. Paolillo, a strate- gically placed settlement perhaps meant to control anc. Catania's hinterland. Details are still few, but so far excava- tions have revealed PR and A Gr remains located in front of a R hypogeum. There has also been more work at the site of Pietralunga (cf. AR 1995-96, 75). Further exploration has revealed a hut destroyed by fire and replaced by a rectangular building. The hut has benches all around its interior, and on its floor was found a large quantity of carbonised grain. A late 8th-Ct-BC date for the hut has been established on the basis of the arte- facts retrieved and on radiocarbon dating of the carbonised wood. Fragments of an Aetos 666 kotyle and of a cup of pos- sibly Rhodian manufacture were discovered underneath the hut's beaten floor. The damage wrought by clandestini on the settlement at Monte Balchino, another site that appeared in the previous report (cf. AR 1995-96, 76), has become clearer thanks to fur- ther work: only a small part of the A deposits have been left, leaving little hope of fruitful results. The last site reported on by Branciforti is that of Rocchicella di Mineo (anc. Palike). Work has concentrated on the area in front of the grotto which opens up at the foot of the hill. A reli- gious building came to light in 1996. The structure, one of whose sides measures 25m, consists of pronaos and opisthodomus and dates to the second half of the 5th Ct BC. The excavators engage in highly interesting speculation, wondering whether this is the religious complex of the Palici which featured prominently in the events surrounding Douketios. Other fea- tures of the anc. city, including geoarchaeology and geomor- phology, have also been investigated in recent years (see AJA 105 [2001] 278-9). From Mineo itself, there is D. Guzzardi's study (Aitna 3 [1999] 89-106) of the anc. fortification system. What remains is a stretch of some 21.5m of wall with one semi- circular tower in pseudo-isodomic masonry, standing to a height</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 171 of at least 6.5m, with a wall thickness that varies between l.lm and 2.4m. Guzzardi has hypothesized three building phases: the first belongs to second half of the 4th Ct BC; the second to just before the Arab siege of Mineo in AD 829-30; and the third to the 12th Ct AD. We may also note here the work ofF. Valenti on the PR sites around Mineo published in Aitna 3 (1999) 83-8 and electronically on the website of the 'Notizario di Archeologia Italiana' located at http://dns.unife.it/notes/imineo.htm. The interpretation of the anc. site located on Monte San Mauro has continued in this period (cf. AR 1995-96, 75). M. Frasca (PdP 52 [1997] 407-17) has argued that the site is to be identified with Euboia, the outpost of Gr Leontinoi, mentioned in anc. sources. This identification of the site as being Khalkidian, rather than Geloan, is independently supported by E. Greco (Hommage Vallet, 281-92), who also urges that it is wrong to think in terms of a Gr site replacing a native one in neat succession. Instead, he argues for a cultural transforma- tion at the site in the late 7th/early 6th Cts BC brought about by native-Greek alliances. If this is true, then we must imagine that a good part of the native population adopted the burial rite of cremation, about which we are now better informed, togeth- er with much more, thanks to the final publicaton by M. Frasca of the early 1970s excavations in the site's necropoleis in La necropoli greca di Monte S. Mauro di Caltagirone: necropoli Saita e Primitivo (Catania 1996). This excellent little publica- tion appears to have been privately circulated, and is unfortu- nately not likely to see wide distribution (I was able to consult a copy in the National Library in Rome). Frasca's study con- tains 166 tombs, dating from the late 7th to early 5th Cts BC, with a notable concentration belonging to the first half of the 6th Ct BC. The dominant burial rite is enchytrismos at 58% (of which 32% are in pithoi, and 68% in amphoras), followed by 'a cappuccina' tombs at 16%, ustrina at 13%, sarcophagi (pri- marily built of tiles and cut blocks) at 11%, and simple pits cut into the earth at 3%. The imported Gr pottery placed in these burials is made up of the usual shapes and producers for the A period. With regard to Caltagirone and surroundings, we may note D. Seminerio's publication (Kokalos 42 [1996] 147-76) of C. Bergamini's 1930s work on the PR Castelluccian site in contrada Angeli, and the appearance of a useful guide to Caltagirone's ceramics museum by E. Cilia Platamone and A. Ragona, Caltagirone: Museo Regionale della Ceramica (Palermo 1995). Many of the fruits of the archaeological activity in Messina discussed in the last report (AR 1995-96, 78) went on public display with an exhibition entitled 'Da Zancle a Messina: un percorso archeologico' in the Teatro Vittorio Emanuele (December 1997-February 1999). An accompany- ing catalogue has been prepared, but as these reports go to press, I have yet to encounter one. These exciting discoveries and the unfortunate death of G. Vallet have done much to renew interest in the Khalkidian cities around the Straits of Messina. The result is an up-to-date collection of articles by leading specialists dedicated to Vallet: M. Gras et al. (eds.), Nel cuore del Mediterraneo antico: Reggio, Messina e le colonie calcidesi dell'area dello Stretto (Corigliano Calabro 2000). The articles either review developments on a city-by-city basis (for example, Zankle, Naxos, and Mylai for Sicily), or tackle developments from a wider regional perspective (such as reli- gious cults and the part played by the Straits in political histo- ry to the end of the 5th Ct BC). Turning to the foundation-period of Zankle, G.M. Bacci has discussed the earliest settlement pottery, in M. Bats and B. D'Agostino (eds.), Euboica. I'Eubea e la presenza euboica in Calcidica e in Occidente: atti del convegno internazionale di Napoli, 13-16 novembre 1996 (Naples 1998) 387-92. Most of the imported Gr material is Cor, with E Greek and Euboic- Cycladic (the main inspiration for local production) represent- ed as well. What is new, and perhaps not unexpected, is the presence of some Phoenician red slip pottery, which could be explained by an enclave of Near Eastern traders. On the foun- dation story of Zankle, we have a very interesting article by L. Antonelli (Kokalos 42 [1996] 315-25), who argues, among other things, that Pithekoussai, and not Kyme, as Thucydides (vi.4.5) maintains, was probably originally behind Zankle's foundation, and that the local toponyms of 'Zankle' and 'Drepanon', which can be related to the myth of Kronos, were employed by the Euboians, in behaviour paralleled in other regions of the Mediterranean, as part of the process of making the land theirs. Recent work on the wider 'Euboianization' of the Straits of Messina also deserves mention here. N. Aric6 studies the mythology and history of Cape Peloro at the very NE comer of the island in Illimite Peloro: interpretazioni del confine terrac- queo (Messina 2000). On the Rhegion sides of the Straits, there are works on the foundation-stories of Rhegion by R. Ganci, Uno ktisma, tre memorie storiche: il caso di Reggio [Kokalos suppl. vol. 13] (Rome 1998), and on the toponym 'Column of Rhegion' found in anc. sources of the 2nd Ct BC and onwards by L. Mercuri (MEFRA 110 [1998] 551-69), who argues that this toponym ultimately goes back to Euboian activity in the Straits, and not to the R period, as had been previously generally thought. Most of the new discoveries by the Messina Superintend- ency are to be found outside the city in the NE comer of the island (G.M. Bacci, Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 249-58), a strate- gic and highly commendable decision, as this is, archaeologi- cally speaking, still one of the least-known regions of Sicily. Greek-native relations are one of the areas of special attention. Bacci notes that the apparent absence of impact on the natives by the arrival of the Greeks in the later 8th and early 7th Cts BC could in part reflect the nature of archaeological work, but probably also reflects reality to a large degree. As partial sup- port for this position, it is pointed out how natives were still living in the territory of Naxos in the late 5th Ct, and how the cultural encounter at Milazzo (anc. Mylai) seems to indicate Greek-native co-existence, judging by the evidence of the necropolis excavated in the 1950s. The BA phases of this site are also better known thanks to this recent activity (G. Tigano et al., QuadMess 9 [1994 (1996)] 5-15), as is the archaeology of the waters off Milazzo thanks to an exhibition in the city in 1997 (cf. G. Tigano (ed.), Rinvenimenti subacquei a Milazzo e il relitto di Punta Mazza. Mostra di archeologia: Castello di Milazzo, Sala del Parlamento, 12 luglio-30 settembre 1997 [Messina 1997]). At Pizzolando near Barcellona to the SW, trial trenching in 1995 on a rocky spur (ca. 600m asl) revealed some PR and early Gr material. Details are still few, but of the native peri- ods, Ausonian II and EIA are represented, the latter showing strong connections with Calabria in S Italy; and amongst the Gr material, there are fibulae and cups of Ionic type. Structures are also reported, but again details are few, which simply whets the appetite for more about this newly discovered settlement. Other new work has also taken place to the SW in the ter- ritory of Tripi. In contrada or casale Piano, a site with a PR predecessor has been identified, thus providing some substance to previous claims that this is the area was once home to anc. Abakainon/Abacaenum (as in G. Todaro, Alla ricerca di Abaceno [Messina 1992], absent in the last report). Further support for this contention is provided by the excavations con-</page><page sequence="28">172 FRANCO DE ANGELIS ducted in the nearby cemetery in contrada Cardusa. Some 60 burials have so far been exca- vated, dating from the end of the 4th to possibly the early 2nd Cts BC; the spatial organization of the dead in family nuclei is also in evidence. The epi- tymbia, some of them inscribed with Greek names, are of high quality and have parallels with materi- [i al from Tyndaris, Messana, and Leontinoi. The l\ grave-goods are of equally noteworthy quality, consisting of gold jewellery, bronze objects (mir- rors and a situla), and perhaps iron weaponry. These finds have led their excavators to suspect that the dead were members of the upper class, including at least one individual of warrior status. Elsewhere, a search for new A sites in the stretch of coast between Milazzo and Himera in the Nebrodi Mountains has not been fruitful: the lack of settlement in this period may have been due to the threat of Etruscan piracy. Some new studies on the already known PR and later C sites of this area have appeared. A synthesis can be found in F. Ingrilli, Dal regno di Eolo alla contea 11. Caroni di Ruggero: citta dei Nebrodi nell'antichitd (Messenia 1996). The HL fortifications of anc. Tyndaris have been re-stud- ied by M. Cavalieri (SicArch xxxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 185-208). Two phases in its construction are recognized. The first phase comprises a wall hastily built around 393 BC, it is argued, as a response to the political turbulence of the time. The second phase dates to the last quarter of the 4th Ct (Timoleon at work?) and is more elaborate. Its design cannot be paralleled at Syracuse, as one might expect, but in the Peloponnese, partic- ularly at Messene and Mantineia, from which cities some of Tyndaris' settlers hailed. Some preliminary thoughts on the geometric mosaics from the LR bath-building in contrada Bagnoli S. Gregorio close to Capo d'Orlando discovered in excavations previously report- ed on (cf. AR 1995-96, 84) have been published by their exca- vator U. Spigo (AISCOM IV, 259-72). Some new work has also recently been undertaken at Capo d'Orlando, and Dr M.C. Lentini (Messina Superintendency) has kindly supplied the fol- lowing brief report of the preliminary results: 'A brief season of excavation took place in July 2000 at Capo d'Orlando, W of the promontory, on the W slopes of the Montevergine hill (never systematically investigated) where anc. Agathyrnum is usually located. Along with material indicating occupation of the site in the 4t-3rd Cts BC were found the remains of structures dating to the 2nd Ct BC, easily identifiable as a storeroom from the presence of numerous pithoi in situ. We are probably dealing with a potter's store- room, rather than a storeroom for foodstuffs: the pithoi appear never to have been used. In any case, both types of storerooms are characteristic of a port area, which in the present case is to be placed in the bay opposite. The most important discovery, however, concerns the identification of levels consistent with a LBA/EIA coastal settlement, the first ever found in the region, with Ausonian I-II material. Remains of a hut with hearth were found. The few traces found of the Rodi-Tindari culture leave one to think that the site had been occupied earlier. Further research is needed, but it is already clear that we have the first case of Ausonian culture along this stretch of Sicily's N coast, which, according to anc. tradition, was once part of Agathymum's kingdom.' We have another brief report by Dr Lentini of recent exca- vations at Caronia (anc. Kaleakte), further W along the coast and slightly inland: a: porticoed building 'Excavations took place between October 1999 and February 2000 at various points in and around the modem town of Caronia: on the N slopes of the hill with the castle, at Caronia Marina, in contrada Pantano, and in the area of the promontory, which extends to the E of the river and which probably forms the limit of the anc. port. Here, a few metres from the coastline, were found the E and S wings of a porticoed building (Fig. 11). Its location and typology with quadrangular partitions of simi- lar dimensions lead one to think that the complex had a utilitar- ian function as either tabernae or, more simply in the absence of structural distinctiveness, warehouses. They are dated to the end of the 3rd/beginning 2nd Cts BC, and destroyed in the mid- 1st Ct AD by an earthquake, perhaps the same one that hit Tyndaris, which caused a good part of the city to fall into the sea (Pliny, NH, ii.206). Pottery finds indicate a re-occupation of the site in the 2nd-3rd Cts AD; some structural remains, together with fragments of a small wine amphora with flat base (similar to a type distinguished at Termini Imerese), belong to the 3rd-4th Cts AD. In Caronia investigations revealed the remains of a well-built terrace wall similar to opus africanum, dated to the start of the 2nd Ct BC and abandoned in the mid- 1st Ct BC, per- haps in connection with the same earthquake that destroyed the above-mentioned building. Its foundations cut into and incor- porated a cistern, whose fill consists mostly of material of the 3rd Ct BC and a small number of fragments of the late 4th Ct BC. The lines of two more walls of the same style were encountered in the same area. Despite the paucity of evidence, it seems to document an urban terrace system, which would, in the 2nd Ct BC, have transformed the previous settlement indicated by the cistern. For the moment, phases following the city's destruction in the mid-1 st Ct AD are scarcely attested.' A colloquium was held in 1995 on anc. Halaisa, further to the W near the town of Tusa on the margins of Messina province, and its proceedings published three years later in A.M. Prestianni Giallombardo (ed.), Colloquio Alesino. Atti del colloquio tenutosi il 7 maggio 1995 in S. Maria delle Palate (Tusa) (Catania 1998). There are studies by S. Calderone and the late G. Nenci on the well-known epigraphic material (Tabulae Halaesinae), and others by A.M. Prestianni Giallombardo, G.M. Bacci, and A. Ragonese on archaeological and historical topics. A piece by Prestianni Giallombardo on the linguistics and orthography of the Tabulae Halaesinae is published elsewhere (Sicilia epigraphica, 449-63).</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 173 remains of four others (Fig. 14). These are located in paral- . .......................^ llel rows separated by narrow corridors, which raises the pos- .c i ^- sibility that the earliest town plan was characterized by dense domestic settlement, unlike the situation attested at Megara Hyblaia. The E-W orientation of the houses follows that of [5 a i_ | the house uncovered in 1954 and of that in this part of the A city. The houses consist of a single rectangular room (and not ..:^H ^ i^ ' t square as is generally the case in the Sicilian colonies). The only house explored completely has one room measuring 5.80 x 3.6m; its entrance is on the long side near the SW cor- ner and it sits in part on the foundations of a MBA hut, of which some post-holes remain. Associated with the MBA material are Thapsos cups and, more abundantly, pottery in 12. Naxos: Attic black-figure cup the Euboic-Cycladic tradition.' At the opposite end of Messina province, work continues at Naxos. There are both new explorations and the study of previously uncovered material to report. On the new explo- rations, we have two reports. The first is by Dr M.C. Lentini (Messina Superintendency): 'Between 1996 and 2000 investigations were undertaken in the urban area of anc. Naxos, particularly in the N quarter, along the slopes of the Larunchi hill (1996 excavations), and h above all on the E side of the Schis6 peninsula, where the old- est colonial settlement has been discovered. Explorations in the N quarter concentrated on the 5th-Ct- BC levels and the area immediately to the N of plateia C, bringing to light a good part of block D4's structures . Opposite block C4, already considerably uncovered (M.C. Lentini, Xenia 20 [1990] 5-22), block D4 is of the standard Naxian width of 39m and contains, as in the case of block C4, 13. Naxos: comer base in plateia A a large number of houses separated by walls. The length of the block, which cannot be determined because it is covered by modem occupation, could be helpful in establishing the extent of the city and the position of the city wall, whose course is unknown hereabouts, but must surely have included the summit of the Larunchi hill, contrary to what has previously been thought. Excavations during 1998-1999 were carried out in the E part of the peninsula, bringing to light a good stretch of the C C town plan, which joins up with crossing 11 of plateia A, as well as some houses in block A10. Later explorations (1999-2000) investigated in detail the levels of plateia A, the earliest dating to the beginning of Naxos (these are the first 8th-Ct levels to be investigated in more than forty years). Plateia A (and by extension of the whole town plan) dates to 480-470 BC; it is 9.5m wide and, as is well known, the largest of the three E-W arteries which traverse the C town plan. The investigations revealed that plateia A sits on top of - a destruction layer from the preceding town plan, dated to the end of the 6th/start of the 5th Cts BC. An Attic bf cup of the Haimon Painter was found in this layer (Fig. 12). The plateia is like others in terms of its construction, consisting of beat- en earth in the form of a donkey's back flanked by paved 1 channels. The crossing with stenopos 11 is distinguished in its customary way from the comer base by orthostats (Fig. O 13). House remains have been uncovered in block A 10, O some of them on top of the older temple C (P. Pelagatti, CdA 16 [1977 (1985)] 46-48, fig.4). One house, in NE comer of j the block, was excavated in its entirety; it measures 13.4 x 12.75m and consists of a paved central courtyard with a well (one of the few discovered at Naxos). The preceding explo- o&amp; . . - 4 rations were conducted in an area close to where a house of the late 8th Ct BC had been found in 1954. This was the only known house of this date until our work discovered the 14. Naxos: houses of the 8th Ct BC</page><page sequence="30">174 FRANCO DE ANGELIS I * 15. Naxos: ship-shed In the second report, Dr D.J. Blackman (director of the British School at Athens) reports on his work on the shipsheds: 'In October 1997 I was invited to attend the 12th Italian conference on underwater archaeology at Giardini Naxos, to speak on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage. During the weekend I visited the site for the first time and was particularly interested by four parallel walls, shown on the tourist plan, at right angles to the coast and at some distance from it. I was told that the walls had been excavated in 1982-83, and had not been fully understood, but had been pre- served from building development. Having learned that they were not horizontal and checked that they were 5.5m apart, I suggested that they might be anc. shipsheds-covered slip- ways for anc. warships which are such a distinctive feature of anc. Greek military harbours (for example, Piraeus), but had not previously been identified in Sicily. The Director of Antiquities, Dr M.C. Lentini, invited me to return and re-examine the remains, to test this interpretation. This we have done in the best preserved shipshed in four sep- arated weeks of test trenching since 1998 (Fig. 15). Under houses of the 5th century AD and other late levels and distur- bances we have found bedrock sloping seawards, with pits containing pottery of the late 5th century BC; this indicates that the shipsheds were built not long before the city was destroyed by Dionysios I of Syracuse (403) for having sided with Athens in the Peloponnesian War. Excavation is continuing on a larger scale in 2001, with two principal aims: to define the extent of the dockyard by trial trenches to north and south of the three shipsheds already located, and to excavate completely what remains of the best preserved shipshed.' On Naxos' history before the Greeks, there are some con- siderations by E. Procelli (Studi Pelagatti, 25-9) on develop- ments in the last decade since his fundamental work on the subject (CdA 22 [1983 (1991)] 9-82). On the Gr city, the study of previously excavated material continues to move along (cf. AR 1995-96, 80), given impetus by two events: the com- memoration of the long career of one of its excavators, P. Pelagatti (cf. Studi Pelagatti), and the conference marking the fortieth anniversary of the beginning of archaeological excava- tions, the proceedings of which have appeared in M.C. Lentini (ed.), Naxos a quarant'anni dall'inizio degli scavi. Atti della tavola rotonda, Giardini Naxos 26-27 ottobre 1995 (Naxos 1998). Several of the contributions to the latter volume (here- after: Atti Naxos) pertain to personal and professional reminis- cences of people and problems connected with the site, impor- tant for understanding the history of research, including a handy overview by P. Pelagatti (Atti Naxos, 39-69) of archae- ological interest in Naxos from the later 19th Ct to the present. On the foundation-period, Lentini updates an earlier sur- vey by Pelagatti of Naxos' early Euboian pottery and imita- tions thereof, in M. Bats and B. D'Agostino (eds.), Euboica: I'Eubea e la presenza euboica in Calcidica e in Occidente: atti del convegno internazionale di Napoli, 13-16 novembre 1996 (Naples 1998) 377-86. There are some ruminations as well by M. Guarducci and S.N. Consolo Langher, in E. Lanzillotta and D. Schilardi (eds.), Le Cicladi ed il mondo egeo. Seminario internazionale di studi, Roma 19-21 novembre 1992 (Rome 1996) 13-9 and 121-53. Guarducci argues that it was the Delian Apollo, over whose sanctuary Cycladic Naxos held much sway in the 8th Ct BC, who sanctioned the sending out of a settlement to Sicily, whereas Consolo Langher stresses more generally the connections of Sicilian Naxos with its Cycladic namesake. J.-P. Morel (Atti Naxos, 149-58) discusses Naxos' commercial connections throughout the city's history. On settlement development, there are several studies to report. M.C. Lentini (Atti Naxos, 71-100) provides a very helpful round-up of work conducted between 1983 and 1995. A. Di Vita (Atti Naxos, 115-24) situates Naxian urbanism in its wider Sicilian Greek context, and 0. Belvedere (Atti Naxos, 125-30) explores the numerous similarities and not so numer- ous differences in the housing of Himera and Naxos. On the fortifications, M. Gras (Atti Naxos, 101-8) studies the A ones in polygonal masonry, and connects their workmanship with E Greeks, perhaps from Lesbos. L. Karlsson (Atti Naxos, 109-13) looks at the tenaille gate in Naxos' fortification sys- tem, and wonders if this was not a Sicilian invention, perhaps even a Naxian one. Weapons found in fortification and sanc- tuary contexts are examined by M.C. Lentini (Studi Pelagatti, 155-66), who argues that the former are connected with Dionysios I's sack of the city and the latter with some kind of rite of passage ritual. On terracottas, C. Ciurcina (141-7) returns to the simas with anthemion decoration from Naxos, Syracuse, and Akrai, and M.C. Lentini (BdA 92 [1995 (1996)] 49-56) publishes two painted antefixes depicting silenoi of the later 6th Ct BC found in 1973 W of the Santa Venera sacred area. Both antefixes once belonged to the same structure, of which no traces have so far appeared. P.Pelagatti (Studi Orlandini, 313-21) re-exam- ines a purported pinax fragment with female figure given to Orsi by an antiquarian in 1912, now residing in Syracuse. She argues, following Beazley, that it originally belonged to an Attic lip cup painted by Sakonides and then goes on to study briefly the distribution of Sakonides' work in Sicily and beyond. In another study, Pelagatti (BdA 101-2 [1997 (1998)] 79-90) has delved into archival material to illuminate further the discovery of tombs N of Naxos in 1883 during the build- ing of a house, which were only briefly reported on by A. Salinas (NSc [1886] 462-3). The tombs date to the 5th-3rd Cts BC, and some of the vases were drawn by a local archaeologi-  .C·. t I . rr r - c- . . . -</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 175 cal inspector and not published till now, and include a pyxis and small bottle in Siceliot rf. These tombs can be added to the growing evidence for human occupation in the vicinity of Naxos after its destruction by Dionysios I. H. Blanck (23-38) publishes 19th-Ct documents con- tained in the archives of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome relating to two already-known archaeological events, namely the discovery in 1851-2 of a hoard of more than 2,000 silver coins of the 5th Ct BC, and the modem fakes of various sculpted items in whose authenticity S. Cavallari had believed. Elsewhere, Blanck (Studi Pelagatti, 255-60) argues that one of these fakes, the figured capital, was based on an original EHL specimen, probably from the vicinity, and, if true, adds another item to the small list of such finds in Sicily. On epigraphy, F. Cordano (Studi Pelagatti, 270-5) inves- tigates briefly the Naxios amphora stamps and personal names. The examples studied date to the 4th-2nd Cts BC, and may refer either to the name of a wine or producer. From Francavilla di Sicilia, further out in the countryside, we have some second thoughts by U. Spigo (Studi Pelagatti, 208-20) on the pinakes found there. P.G. Guzzo (Atti Naxos, 159-61) re-examines a bronze helmet with relief decoration acquired by P. Orsi in the early 20th Ct at Moio Alcantara. Nothing is known of the helmet's archaeological context, but Guzzo argues that the helmet could fit in comfortably with Sicily's political turbulence of the second half of the 4th Ct BC, during which time one finds arms commonly placed in burials. Close to Naxos at Taormina, we may begin with an inter- esting little work on P. Orsi and the antiquities trade of Taormina in the early 20th Ct (P. Pelagatti, Kalos 10.1 [1998] 20-7). One of the interesting new developments from this site is the publication by G. Bacci (Studi Pelagatti, 50-7) of two A antefixes found during excavation of the R bath-building in the early 1960s. One is of the palmette type, and dates to about the third quarter of the 6th Ct (Fig. 16), the other is the head of a black male of the last quarter of the 6th Ct to first quarter of the 5th Ct; both appear to be of Naxian manufacture. During these excavations fragments of Gr pottery from the 7th and 6th Cts were also found, which, together with the antefixes, has led Bacci to hypothesize that the Naxians occupied this strategic location overlooking their settlement in the early 7th Ct, driving away or incorporating the native residents. On coinage of the 4th-Ct BC, G. Manganaro argues that the origins of the silver litrai with female face on the obverse and Sardo legend on the reverse are more likely to lie somewhere in the area of Himera and Thermai (in U. Fellmeth and H. Sonnabend (eds.), Alte Geschichte. Wege, Einsichten, Horizonte. Festschrift fur Eckart Olshausen zum 60. Geburtstag [Hildesheim 1998] 131-42). On the epigraphic front, U. Fantasia (Sicilia epigraphi- ca, 251-79) returns to the sitophylakes and sitonia, while H. Blanck (MDAI(R) 104 [1997] 507-11; PdP 52 [1997] 241-55) publishes another fragment of an inscription found in 1969, and missed in the editio princeps, mentioning the contents of the anc. library in the HL gymnasium (on which see the piece by P. Pelagatti, PdP 52 [1997] 256-61 meant to accompany Blanck's). The new fragment makes it clear that the library's possessions included the works of Anaximander of Miletos. The next item also derives from older archaeological work at Taormina and involves a forgotten R imperial domus (lst/2nd Cts AD) that first came to light in 1977 during the con- struction of a building intended to house a hotelier school (S. Samaritano and M.C. Lentini, Archeologia Viva xix.81 [2000] 2-3). Excavations occurred in the following year, revealing a peristyle plan with flooring in opus tessellatum and opus sign- 16. Taormina: antefixes inum (cocciopesto). One of the structure's rooms contains a mosaic with Dionysiac themes, and may have been used as the triclinium. Plans are presently under way to open the site to the public. Also on the R period, we also have a lengthy article by P. Pensabene (Studi Di Vita, 213-55) on the marbles used to build Taormina's theatre. Pensabene observes that the scaenae frons was reconstructed twice in the imperial period (Trajanic-Hadrianic and Severan), a clear indication of the region's economic prosperity. In the Aeolian islands, the publication programme of L. Bemab6 Brea and M. Cavalier, together with their numerous collaborators, has continued at an admirably productive level: no fewer than four volumes of the Meligunis Lipdra series have appeared between 1994 and 2000. How the unfortunate death of Bemab6 Brea will impact on this remains to be seen. Three of the four final reports pertain to Lipari: Meligunis Lipdra VII: Lipari. Contrada Diana. Scavo XXXVI in propri- etd Zagami (1975-1984) (Palermo 1994); Meligunis Lipdra VIII.2: #e,raiv rj; 'ItaciaS Kai Trj; SIKEi;. Fontiper la sto- ria dell'arcipelago eoliano in etd greca (Palermo 1995); Meligunis Lipdra X: scoperte e scavi archeologici nell'area urbana e suburbana di Lipari (Rome 2000). For the history of archaeological research on the Aeolian islands, useful for understanding the data and their acquisition, there are several works to report. On the history of scholarship: M.A. Mastelloni and U. Spigo (eds.), Agli albori della ricerca archeologica nelle Eolie: scavi e scoperte a Lipari nel XIX secolo (Palermo 1998), and U. Spigo et al. (eds.), Dal 'constitutum 'alle 'con- troversie liparitane'. Le chiavi di lettura della storia eoliana nell'ultimo millennio [Quademi del Museo Archeologico Regionale Eoliano vol. 2] (Palermo 1996). On the Aeolian Museum: U. Spigo and M.C. Martinelli (eds.), Dieci anni al Museo Eoliano (1987-1996) ricerche e studi [Quademi del Museo Archeologico Regionale Eoliano vol. 1] (Messina 1996), and a handy guide by L. Bemab6 Brea et al., Lipari: Museo Archeologico Eoliano (Palermo 1994) (English edition published in 1996). There has also been some work on the archaeology and history of A and C Gr presence in the archipelago. On the foundation-period, there is an overview of the sta- tus quo by M. Cavalier (Hommage Vallet, 293-302), who fol- lows the anc. sources in thinking that the pre-Greek population numbered around 500, and that the archaeology supports the foundation-date found in literary sources. Cavalier also high- lights how little is still known archaeologically of the settle- ment's first century or so of existence. In another article, M.L. Zunino (Quaderni di Storia xxiii.45 [1997] 145-53) argues that the eremia of the Aeolian islands before the arrival of the Greeks is to be explained with the help of a fragment of Xenophanes (21A48 Diels-Kranz). Zunino argues that the seismic activity . I :/r I I : · -'··;r ··: .. ,1 .- .· .. I Y- V · I ' : 1</page><page sequence="32">176 FRANCO DE ANGELIS I-! i z,.( fW -,1. 7, , 1 -t " 17. Morgantina: house site in the Aeolian archipelago mentioned by Xenophanes hap- pened just before the Greeks arrived, thus opening the door to the latter for settlement. There are two articles on the early his- tory of Gr settlement in the Aeolian islands in L. Braccesi (ed.), Hesperia VII: studi sulla grecita di Occidente (Rome 1996) by L. Braccesi (33-6) and R. Sammartano (37-56). Braccesi argues that Cnidian settlement took place in 627/6 BC, when Cnidians accompanied the Megarians taking part in the settle- ment of Selinous. In another highly interesting article, A. Fouchard combines historical and archaeological sources to explain the development of Lipari's political arrangement, in F. Letoublon (ed.), Impression d'iles (Toulouse 1996) 57-67. The author begins by pointing out that the lands of the Gr set- tlers were spread out over seven islands, a situation which demanded that the citizens be agriculturalists and sailors on a rotating annual basis, and in turn caused land and sea to be cru- cial features of the constitution at all times. Pottery and coroplastic studies have also been active: an overview of the 4th-Ct-BC material from the contrada Diana cemeteries has been put together by L. Bernab6 Brea and M. Cavalier, La ceramica figurata della Sicilia e della Magna Grecia nella Lipara del IVsec. a.C. (Milan 1997). This mono- graph is intended in part to provide grist for the mill of those interested in cultural, religious, and economic history. The authors also emphasize that we should be wary that A.D. Trendall's chronologies are based primarily on stylistic, rather than stratigraphic analysis. Elsewhere Cavalier studies potters and painters on Lipari in the 1 st half of the 3rd Ct BC (in L 'Italie meridionale et les premieres experiences de la peinture hel- lenistique: actes de la table ronde, Rome, 18 fevrier 1994 [Collection de l'Ecole Fran9aise de Rome vol. 244] [Rome 1998] 191-202). On coroplastics, there is a brief article by Bemab6 Brea and M. Cavalier (Studi Pelagatti, 261-4) on rep- resentations of Euripides. The well-known Sicilian appassionato V. Giustolisi has turned some of his fervent attention to Vulcano, the neigh- bouring island to the S, in two works: Vulcano: introduzione alla storia e all 'archeologia dell 'antica Hiera (Palermo 1995), with an appendix on the antiquities of Lipari in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford by D. Gill and M. Vicker (cf. the brief notices by R. Santoro, Magna Grecia xxxi.1-3 [1996] 23, and N. Cusumano, Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 741-2), and, on rupes- trian archaeology, Atlante delle antiche strutture rupestri dell'Isola di Vulcano I (Palermo 1996). From the island of Salina further to the NNE, we have another final publication of recent work: L. Bemab6 Brea et al., Meligunis Lipdra VIII.1: Salina: ricerche archeologiche (1989-1993) (Palermo 1995). The catalogue of a photograph- ic exhibition in Palermo of the excavations at the PR site of Capo Graziano on Filicudi, another Aeolian island to the W, has recently appeared: V. Giustolisi (ed.), Gli eoli in Occidente (Palermo 1999). CENTRAL SICILY Province of Enna In 1994, after flooding caused by heavy rains, members of a local Archeoclub drew attention to the remains of a R villa site at contrada Geraci, located some dozen kilometers to the S of Enna. E. Cilia Platamone of the Enna Superintendency stepped in, undertaking excavations covering an area of about 500m2 (results published in M. Khanoussi et al. (eds.), L'Africa romana: atti dell'XI convegno di studio, Cartagine, 15-18 dicembre 1994 [Ozieri 1996] 1683-9, and AISCOM IV, 273-80). This work revealed five rooms oriented E-W, meas- uring 10 x 15m and containing a peristyle along the S and W sides. The villa was decorated with mosaics in opus tessella- tum. The villa also shows signs of re-use in the 10th and 11 th Cts AD. An archaeological survey of the Torcicoda Valley, situat- ed a few km to the S of Enna, has been under way since 1995 under the direction of E. Giannitrapani (Enna Superintendency) and M. Pluciennik (University of Wales at Lampeter). Some preliminary reports have already appeared (SicArch xxxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 59-69; Antiquity 75 [2001] 13-), and others are in progress (I am grateful to the project directors for making these available to me in advance of publi- cation). In contrada San Tommaso several disused water- mills were found, and around one at riparo 1, field-walkers recovered anc. pottery of various periods (still imprecisely defined BA, A-HL Greek, and R from the 2nd Ct AD onwards). A small trial trench was opened up in the 2000 season and revealed a good and complex stratigraphy that is still being studied. Nevertheless, it seems certain that the material retrieved includes MBA/LBA undecorated pottery. A fragment of a Castelluccian (EBA) basin was discovered in riparo 3. The project has also added another candidate to Sicily's ever-growing list of Hellenized native sites with the discovery of Monte Iuculia. Surface finds cover an area of 250 x 150m, and in addition to native material of the Licodia Eubea type researchers also found small quantities of Byz, later Med, and moder pottery. No structures are visible on the surface, but a series of low banks suggests the possibility of large animal pens. The survey has also revealed in many places a landscape covered with R material, particularly pottery and tile frag- ments. At least two large R sites have been found: one of them, measuring some 100 x 100m, is located in contrada San </page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 177 18. Morgantina: house Tomasello, and the other in contrada Riscicalla with its dark soils of high organic content and nearby olive orchard. The researchers have also noted the paucity of later Med material, which they argue is in part real (citing the rural crisis of the 13th Ct AD), and in part the result of erosion and agriculture. At Morgantina the pattern of research has not changed since the last report (AR 1995-96, 85-6): some new activities in the field have taken place alongside continued studies of already excavated material. On the new work, Prof. M. Bell III, co-director of the American work, supplies the following report: 'At the request of the Superintendency at Enna and the Italian judiciary, in 1997 and 1998 the Virginia/Wesleyan proj- ect supervised excavation of the spot where an important treas- ure of Hellenistic silver had been found clandestinely ca 1980-81. The treasure was subsequently purchased in two lots in 1981 and 1982 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Bulletin, Metropolitan Museum of Art [Summer 1984] nos. 92-106; cf. A.L. Slayman, Archaeology 51.3 [1998] 40-1). The recent excavation was supervised by Malcolm Bell as a consultant for the Superintendency; the project was directed by Lorenzo Guzzardi, director of the archaeological section at Enna. A preliminary report has appeared in Antichitd senza provenienza II (supplement to BdA 101-102 [1997 (2000)] 31-41). The findspot of the silver treasure was revealed to be a Greek house in the western quarter of Morgantina, located on the ninth stenopos W of the agora (stenopos W 9) near its intersection with plateia A (lot no. 2, insula W9/10c). The entire house had been methodically excavated room by room by the clandestini, and only a few square meters of floor deposit were left intact in the areas between their trenches. The surviving parts of the house are well-preserved, consist- ing of eight rooms around a small central court (Fig. 17). A masonry staircase in the court indicates an upper story, and the beaten earth floors suggest that the surviving rooms formed a functional basement level. The largest room (8) had its own door to the street and may have served as a stable (Fig. 18). The house was the first on its lot; a construction date in the 4th century BC is probable. Two substantial holes were discovered in the beaten earth floors, in the comers of rooms away from exterior doors (5, 7); both had been emptied in recent times and are likely to be the original hiding places of the silver (Fig. 19). At the bottom of one of the holes was a Mamertine coin minted ca 216-212 BC (cf. Morgantina Studies II, no. 233; from undisturbed fill). The house was evidently abandoned after 211 BC, when Morgantina was captured by the Romans, for no finds within 19. Morgantina, house: floor cavity or on the floors are later than the third century BC. The termi- nus post quem for the burial of the silver is thus separated from the terminus ante quem by no more than five years. The Morgantina treasure appears to be one of the most closely dat- able finds of anc. silver. A new reading of the graffito inscrip- tions on the silver indicates that it was in the possession of one Eupolemos, a name attested epigraphically at Morgantina in the third century, on a lead real estate transaction found in the same quarter of the city (PdP 44 [1989] 203-5). The house may have belonged to Eupolemos. The new house has shed light on the original form of the city plan of Morgantina, where the lot size of 17.7 x 18.6m (55 x 58.5 feet of 0.322m) has now been recognized as standard through most, if not all, of the early city. The functional two- storey house on a single lot also contrasts with the elegant peri- style houses of the third century, with their signinum and mosa- ic floors, occupying several lots of the original plan. The new house appears rather to be a link with the earlier domestic architecture of Morgantina, of which the House of the Silver Hoard E of the agora is an example. In 1999 the Virginia/Wesleyan project returned to a large and well-preserved IA hut on the Cittadella, in an excavation conducted by Carla Antonaccio and Robert Leighton, under the direction of Lorenzo Guzzardi of the Enna Superintendency (see R. Leighton, Morgantina Studies IV, 21-7 for the first phase of excavation). The hut was initially discovered in 1961 and revisited in 1962 and 1989; it was revealed in 1999 to be even larger than had been thought, with a length of at least 10.50m. A return to the building is anticipated in 2002.

Morgantina: inscribed stele A and HL architectural terracottas. In 1998 Erik Thorkildsen began work on a detailed comprehensive plan of the entire site of Morgantina, completion of which is expected in 2001.' Some new field-work on geology and hydrology has also been undertaken as part of the larger interest in the landscapes and resources of Morgantina and surroundings initiated in the early 1990s (see G. Bruno and S. Nicosia, in C. Albore Livadie and F. Ortolani (eds.), II sistema uomo-ambiente: tra passato e presente [Bari 1998] 185-96; G. Bruno and C. Elsa Renna, Cura aquarum, 69-78). The authors note the precarious hydro-geological situation of Morgantina in HL times. Of the studies based on already excavated material, we may begin by noting that a second edition has appeared of the general history of Morgantina by the local enthusiast S. Raffiotta, C'era una volta Morgantina (Enna 1996). The A necropoleis have now been published by C.L. Lyons, Morgantina Studies V: the archaic cemeteries (Princeton 1996) (favourably reviewd by J.K. Papadopoulos, BMCR 98.5.08; B.A. Sparkes, Classical Review 48 [1998] 542-3; G. Shepherd, AJA 103 [1999] 147-8). In the penultimate chapter of this work, Lyons paints an exciting picture of a multicultural soci- ety of natives, Sicilian Greeks, immigrants from all across the Mediterranean, and people of mixed heritage. An excellent overview of A urbanism is provided by C. Antonaccio (in H.D. Andersen et al. (eds.), Urbanization in the Mediterranean in the 9th to 6th centuries BC [Acta Hyperborea vol. 7] [Copenhagen 1997] 167-93), who warns against the simplistic conclusion, common in past scholarship, that a planned urban settlement is a sure sign of Gr presence and control. Elsewhere S.M. Thompson and Antonaccio (AJA 105 [2001] 279-80) have argued that this could be better explained as acculturation (cf. also Antonaccio, AJA 105 [2001] 268 on identifying Morgantina as native through the evidence of household pottery). Kamarina's control of Morgantina in the late 5th Ct BC has been addressed by M. Bell (Studi Di Vita, 291-7), who observes that Kamarina's presence is discernible in the overall plan of the agora and the position of the stoai within it. On the urban development of Morgantina in the time of Hieron II, we have another paper by M. Bell (Hommage Vallet, 257-77). Morgantina is shown to be a miniature Syracuse, and its architecture was charged with the same sort of political and ideological significance as that of the capital. Work by I.E.M. Edlund-Berry on the central sanctuary near the theatre has continued in this period (Opuscula Romana 20 [1996] 15-9). In this latest contribution, Edlund- Berry shows how, after the Roman conquest, the central sanc- tuary underwent numerous modifications in architectural plan, cult, and status of the worshippers so as. to remove anything that could have been a political risk to Rome, supporting her case with parallels of similar behaviour from other sites in S Italy and Sicily. Advances have also been made in the epigraphy of Morgantina. C.M. Antonaccio (Kadmos 38 [1999] 87-96) has published a fascinating votive stele excavated in 1961 (Figs. 20-21). The stele has no real parallel in native or Gr Sicily. A rough date for it can be established by the fact that it was built into a wall of the 6th Ct BC, which provides a secure terminus ante quem. Eight certain letters have been preserved, and the likeliest language in which they were written is Sikel, or pos- sibly Messapic, owing to parallels with Daunian stele from S Italy. Antonaccio speculates that the stele was set up to mark the grave of a Messapian warrior who died fighting in foreign lands. Elsewhere Antonaccio returns (ZPE 126 [1999] 177-85; cf. AR 1995-96, 86) to Kypara, expounding her case more fully for identifying her as a native nymph. M. Bell (Studi Pelagatti, 246-54) publishes a highly interesting stamp with the monogram of Morgantina and the sign of Tanit, which has implications for the dating of IIKEAIQTAN coinage. The splendid site of Piazza Armerina continues to attract academic attention. There are two new guidebooks to the site: L. Villari, L 'Ibla sicana e il sito della villa imperiale di Piazza Armerina (Rome 1995), and S. Guglielmino, Uno splendido monumento lasciato in Sicilia dall'impero romano: la villa romana del casale di Piazza Armerina (n.p. 1997). Of the studies devoted to certain features of the villa, we may begin with a work that interprets the villa complex as nothing more than a brothel (!): L. Centonze, Vizi, costumi e peccati nelle ville romane di Sicilia: il casale di Piazza Armerina (Palermo 1999). G.V. Gentili (BdA 98 [1996] 1-16) returns to a pet the- ory that the emperor Maximian owned the villa (but see R.J.A. Wilson, Piazza Armerina [London 1983] 86-99, who, to my mind, long ago convincingly refuted it). On the mosaics, there are articles by G. Guillaume-Coirer (Ostraka 5 [1996] 45-62) on the education of children as found in four moscaics, A. Coralini (AISCOM IV, 299-324) on Hercules victor, and S. Muth (MDAI(R) 106 [1999] 189-212) on the function of the Great Hunt mosaic. On questions of conservation, all-impor- tant in a site so well-trodden by tourists, we have two works published in this period: L. Guzzardi (AISCOM IV, 325-32) and N. Stanley-Price (in M. de la Torre (ed.), The Conservation of Archaeological Sites in the Mediterranean Region. An International Conference organized by the Getty Conservation Institute and the J. Paul Getty Museum, 6-12 May 1995 [Los Angeles 1997] 65-92). On Sofiana, there is an article by G.F. La Torre (QuadMess 9 [1994 (1996)] 99-139) published in this period of work car- ried out and reported on previously (AR 1995-96, 86-7). S. Tramontana and M.C. Cantale have published a useful round-up, with commentary, of the anc. written sources avail- able for Troina and its history: Troina: problemi, vicende, fonti (Rome 1998). The archaeology of Troina has also moved for- ward with theTroina Project begun in 1997. Dr S. Stoddart</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 179 22. Troina: region (Cambridge University), one of the project directors, has pro- vided the following report on its aims and initial results: 'The upland regions of the Mediterranean world have been long neglected, and yet are as essential to Mediterranean understanding as the coastal zones. The Troina Project was formulated to address the study of upland landscape in the region of Sicily. The region was chosen in response to an invi- tation from the Comune of Troina (Province of Enna) and the support of the Soprintendenza per i Beni Culturali ed Ambientali di Enna, the Oasi Maria SS di Troina, and the McDonald Institute (Cambridge). The little-known territory is located on the southern edge of the Nebrodi mountains and is predominantly above 500m in altitude (Fig. 22). The predom- inant geology is flysch whose sandstones have provided promi- nent natural markers and settlement locations. The project is developing a strategy of regional survey fol- lowed by selective excavation to investigate the long-term archaeological history of the region. Two principal foci have been addressed in this work. Firstly, the anc. environment from ca 100,000 BC to moder times is being investigated by a team co-ordinated by Dr Charles French of the Department of Archaeology, Cambridge. Geomorphological survey has been accompanied by detailed micromorphological investiga- tion of particular localities to understand the impact of human activity on this delicate vertical landscape. Secondly, archaeo- logical effort has concentrated on the first expansion of human populations into the upland areas from the lowland plains (e.g. Catania). Regional survey has shown that the crucial transition was between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. During the fourth millennium BC, the first permanent settlement was placed on a 650m asl shelf below the sandstone outcrop of Serro Scalvi. In the succeeding Malpasso phase, settlement appears to have expanded into more upland and lowland local- ities. A key element accompanying this expansion into the uplands appears to have been the intensification of the second- ary products of agriculture. Distinctive ceramic material cul- ture (e.g. sieves, spouts, ribbed, footed vessels) appears to indi- cate the exploitation of milk products. A central part of the project has been directed towards a well-preserved house which formed part of the Serraferlicchio settlement below Serro Scalvi (behind the 18th-Ct villa of Casa Sollima). The results of this work have been provisionally published in Antiquity 74 (2000) 471 and SicArch (in press). A 10 x 12m oval drystone wall was detected preserved under col- luvial deposits (below steep slopes and above an intensively cultivated olive grove) (Fig. 23). Hearths, pits, postholes and daub fragments have allowed the provisional computer reconstruction of this struc- ture by Fraser Sturt. This work suggests that half the oval enclosure was covered and half open, after analysis of daub fragments and distribution of finds. A stone cooking support in one of the hearths provides further evidence of the slow heat required in cheese production, and provisional results from faunal and floral analysis suggest a pastoral economy dominated by sheep, with floral remains that include cereals, beans and wild fruits. The work of the project is not devoted exclu- sively to prehistory. Work has been addressed to the formation of the territorial identity of Troina, which is likely to have taken place from the end of the Bronze Age (with the appearance of tombs), the developing relations between native and Greek populations (marked by another partly excavated settlement on the Serro Scalvi plateau), the impact of Rome and other powers in the historical peri- ods. A more comprehensive picture of other associated devel- oping themes such as genetics are given in the project web site: http://www.arch. cam.ac.uk/DEPT/troina/.' On the ponte Vecchio of Cerami and the region's anc. routeways we have A. Sorace (Aitna 3 [1999] 119-38), and in a similar vein R.P.A. Patane (Aitna 3 [1999] 119-38) considers the evidence for R routeways in the area of Centuripe. In another work (CdA 31 [1992 (1997)] 67-82) Patane has exam- ined the known evidence, literary and archaeological, for Timoleon at Agira (anc. Agyrion) and Centuripe (anc. Kentoripai). Re-reading Diodoros (xvi.82.4-5), the author concludes that the people of these cities could have been made citizens of Syracuse (including by deportation). For Agira, Patane suggests that the area presently occupied by the Swabian castle would probably have been the centre of the anc. fortified site. Accounts of the early travellers (Fazello, Houel, and Demon) are also studied to trace the course of the S stretch of city wall no longer visible. The site of the anc. theatre which Agyrion is known to have had is located in the area of the churches of Saints Peter and Augustine. He also argues that the existence of a bouleuterion at the site indicates Agyrion's sta- tus as an autonomous city (not kome, or village) under the con- trol of Syracuse. In respect of Centuripe, the possibility is raised that the city's first coins could date to after 338 BC, and not before, as is usually believed. Furthermore, the late 4th-Ct- BC busts of Demeter and Kore known from the site could be interpreted as having played a part in Timoleon's propaganda. 23. Troina: drystone wall</page><page sequence="36">180 FRANCO DE ANGELIS SOUTHERN SICILY Provinces of Agrigento and Caltanissetta Three general works on anc. Agrigento have been published in this period: P. Griffo, Akragas, Agrigento: la storia, la topografia, i monumenti, gli scavi (Agrigento 1995); G. Di Giovanni, Agrigento: la cittd dei Dioscuri [Quademi della Lega navale italiana, sezione di Agrigento vol. 5] (n.p. [Italy] 1995); P. Cilona, Agrigento, uomini nel tempo: personaggi di Akragas, Agrigentum, Kerkent, Gergent, Grigentum, Girgenti, Agrigento (Palermo 1996). Some studies on particular features of the city's history have also appeared. On the tyrant Phalaris, O. Murray tries to disentangle myth from history in L.B. Pulci Doria (ed.), L'incidenza dell'antico: studi in memoria di Ettore Lepore II (Naples 1996) 165-80. In the same volume (181-92), C. Vatin publishes a dedication by the tyrant Theron at Delphi for an equestrian victory in either 486, 482, or 478 BC. On the Emmenids and the literary tradition, there is a work by C. Caserta, Gli Emmenidi e le tradizioni poetiche e storiografiche su Akragasfino alla battaglia di Himera (Rome 1999). J. de la Geniere (Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres [1995] 1005-21) shows convinc- ingly that 5th-Ct Attic potters worked to satisfy the cultural needs of their rich Akragantine patrons. A colloquium on Agrigento's administrative and cultural features between HL and R times took place in Palermo in late 1996, and its five papers were published in Kokalos 42 (1996) 3-90. G. Fiorentini (5-14) provides a quick overview of the gymnasium and its inscriptions. E. De Miro (15-29) considers how the Romans reacted to the city plan they inherited and concludes that, apart from some changes in the Augustan peri- od to the San Nicola crossroads, they generally respected it (cf. also De Miro, Studi Pelagatti, 380-6). There are two more his- torical papers by F.P. Rizzo (75-82) on the bouleuterion and the synkletos mentioned in Inscriptiones Graecae xiv.952, and D. Vera (31-58) combining the written and archaeological evi- dence for the imperial period. The truly new archaeological discoveries are contained in the final paper by R.M. Bonacasa Carra (59-74), who reports on the latest excavations in the LR necropolis just inside the city wall (cf. AR 1995-96, 88). More tombs have come to light E of the Catacomba di Fragapane. They consist of another hypogeum (L), and some rock-cut inhumations; all of them had been heavily plundered and, in the case of the latter, re-used in Med times (11 th to 13th Cts AD) as kilns, as evidenced by potting tools, clay preparation facili- ties, and firing in the form of ashes and wasters. Numerous finished wares, especially of a domestic nature, were also found in and around the kilns. Two more hypogea (P and Q) were found in 1993 and 1996, though work has so far gone lit- tle beyond revealing their painted plastered doors, one of which, dating to the 4th Ct AD, was decorated with garland and candle. Part of an E-W running road (5m wide) was uncovered in front of these hypogea; it links up with another stretch of road previously excavated by De Miro in front of hypogeum D, which in turn is a continuation of the cardo in the area of the gymnasium. The city's astounding Greek monuments naturally contin- ue to generate scholarship. We have the hefty final publication of the sanctuaries of 'Porta V': E. De Miro (ed.), Agrigento. I santuari urbani: I'area sacra tra il Tempio di Zeus e Porta V [Bibliotheca Archaeologica vol. 28] (Rome 2000). Most of the material published there was discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, but there is also a brief account of some houses of the 6th and 5th Cts BC found in 1995-96 during more minor operations. There is some insightful work on the temple of Zeus Olympios to report. The meaning of the gigantomachy in Sicilian Gr architectural sculpture has been re-examined by M. Barbanera (in L. Bacchielli and M. Bonanno Aravantinos (eds.), Scritti di antichitd in memoria di Sandro Stucchi II [Rome 1996] 149-53). The author questions the usual inter- pretation of the gigantomachy in the temple of Zeus Olympios at Akragas as referring to Theron's victory over the Carthaginians at Himera in 480 BC. Other possible meanings are raised by considering the gigantomachy scenes at Athens and Selinous in the 6th Ct BC, where it is most likely that these images were used by the tyrants of these cities to mark their tri- umph over local political opposition. On this line of reasoning, the gigantomachy at Akragas could belong to the period of internal political turbulence that brought Theron to power. This view is supported independently by other recent studies: B.A. Barletta (AJA 101 [1997] 370) also questions the standard view that the temple commemorated the 480 BC victory, argu- ing instead that it was built slightly earlier in a different politi- cal climate. C. Marconi (Prospettiva 87-88 [1997] 2-13) arrives independently at the same conclusions and convincing- ly argues that the tyrant Theron constructed it on gaining the upper hand over his political opponents within the city. C. Zoppi (Studi Gullini, 211-20) dates the temple of Vulcano to the decade preceding the Carthaginian sack of the city and argues that the temple had been finished by that point. The Ch re-use of anc. Gr temples is explored, in a more wide- ranging way than suggested by its title, in N. Vicari, L'enigma del tempio di Giove Polieo (Palermo 1998) (reviewed by D. Barbagli, Archeologia Viva xix.79 [2000] 93). On the kolym- bethra mentioned in anc. sources, there is a study by S. Collin Bouffier (Cura aquarum, 37-43) arguing that they were a park made by the tyrant Theron, who, like other Sicilian Greek tyrants and Persian kings, also gained political capital in doing so. On HL mosaics, there are two papers in AISCOM IV, 233-6 and 237-46 on, respectively, emblemata by E. De Miro and conservation by G. Tripodi. Turning to the islands and waters off Agrigento province, we may begin with the attempt by A. De Miro (QuadMess 9 [1994 (1996)] 17-47) to interpret the curvilinear structures long known on the island of Lampedusa. There is a brief report on underwater explorations near this island and the nearby island of Lampione (G. Fiorentini, Bollettino di Archeologia Subacquea 2-3 [1995-96] 351-6). Two concen- trations of anchors have been found: one is of early modem date, while the other is of LR/EByz date, as indicated by some pottery found nearby. A field survey has been carried out in the stretch of coast between Agrigento and Siculiana (V. Di Bella and F. Santagati, SicArch xxxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 71-104). This area, of some 48km2, was intensively surveyed, with the exception of built-up areas and other off-limits places; in so far as it was possible, the surveyors distinguished between sites and sherd scatters. A total of 66 sites, sherd scatters, and small cemeter- ies have been recognized, belonging to broad chronological periods of prehistory and classical antiquity. A PR site of the Castelluccian culture was discovered at Faro Rossello on the doorstep of Agrigento, and much PR material has been noted in other places around later Gr Akragas. The sites dating to the Gr period are generally found only on the calcareous for- mations, whereas those of the R period are found all over the survey area. For the A period, no signs of permanent settle- ment have come to light, and the surveyors argue that this was due to a lack of good water supply and the proximity of the area to the city-state centre, which obviated the need for per- manent settlement. The only exception to this rule is the site at Faro Rossello, at which considerable high-quality pottery has been located. The surveyors posit that this was the site of a</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 181 25. Campanaio: building complex ularly shaped flagstones. The superstructure supported by 24. Herakleia Minoa: house block phrourion required to protect a weak spot very close to Akragas, and that the site may also have served as some kind of terminal to which agricultural products from the hinterland were sent. No sites of the late C/early HL times were discov- ered, and the landscape also appears to have been unoccupied during the first three centuries of the R period. From the 4th Ct AD onwards, sites of large and small dimensions, comprising both farmsteads and villages (the largest 1.5 ha), become numerous. Eighteen sites date from the last quarter of the 6th Ct alone. Finewares retrieved from some smaller sites could indicate rural residence. Tree crops are thought to have been the economic mainstay, judging from the location of sites. The authors also argue that the via Selinuntina probably did not fol- low the course of the present SS 115, as is usually believed, but further to the N along the shoulder of the hills along the coast. The mosaics of the R coastal villa site at Durrueli di Realmonte, on the SW doorstep of Agrigento, have been stud- ied by F. Guidobaldi (AISCOMIV, 247-58). We have more details of excavations in houses at Herakleia Minoa mentioned very briefly in the last report (L. Campagna, in F. D'Andria and K. Mannino (eds.), Ricerche sulla casa in Magna Grecia e in Sicilia. Atti del colloquio, Lecce, 23-24 giug- no 1992 [Galatina 1996] 111-22; cf. AR 1995-96, 93). The houses are located in a block of the anc. city located SW of the theatre, between stenopos III on the S and the N-S running plateia on the E (the block's N and W limits are unknown) (Fig. 24). Some rooms are of quadrangular shape, and not accessible from one another-five such rooms open to the stenopos and two to the plateia; at least two rooms (4-4A and 6-7) can be accessed from each other. The houses are of tetrastyle atrium plan of Italic or R type, with almost square courtyard (5.5 x 6m). The foundations are made up of two courses of stone, worked only on their visible faces, set side by side and held together by earth; the surrounding pavement consists of irreg- 26. Campanaio: mortarium stamp these foundations may have been made of clay or mud-brick; the columns were built of numerous unfluted pieces. The houses were constructed in the 3rd Ct BC and destroyed around 50-25 BC. Excavations at Campanaio (AR 1995-96, 94) continued in 1997 and 1998 under the direction of Prof. R.J.A. Wilson (University of Nottingham), who has kindly supplied the fol- lowing report: 'The excavations produced a wealth of important fresh detail about this HL and R agricultural village, for which seven principal phases are now known. Activity started ca 200 BC, and was intensive for two centuries in the central part of the site. A complex of buildings (area C) underwent two complete reconstructions between 200 BC and AD 25; in its last phase (ca. 50 BC) it comprised an L-shaped building some 17m long and 8.40m wide, with dry-stone walls, earth floors and mud- brick superstructure (Fig. 25). A rubbish dump outside it yield- ed much 2nd/1st Ct-BC ceramic and environmental material, with evidence for contact with Cyrenaica (brazier lugs), Greece (a Rhodian wine amphora stamped 'Agathokleus') and N Africa (including a unique mortarium stamped with an ostrich and the letters T and P) (Fig. 26). Nearby (area G) industrial activity, starting before 150 BC, is attested by two inter-connecting cisterns and a small tile kiln, 2.95m long. One cistern, 4m deep, had an inflow channel (of purpose-made pipes) and an overflow pipe (an afterthought), made up of reused Punic amphoras with their spikes knocked off (three are stamped, one with the sign of 'Tanit') (Fig. 27). The reuse of amphoras as water pipes is surprisingly rare, a phenomenon paralleled only in Graeco-Roman times at Gela, Eyguieres, Bibracte, Rome, Cagliari, Nora and Gortyn.

Campanaio: overflow pipe replaced ca 125 BC by a bigger structure on an adjacent site (4.75 x 4.25m) (Fig. 28): this was very well preserved, with flue arch intact and a curious split-level firing chamber within, a brick-revetted step marking the junction of the two levels. At this stage the Campanaio settlement was probably quite small, a large farmstead rather than a village proper, although the tile- works represents considerable estate investment. Scanty early imperial activity was followed by renewed building work in the LR period (ca. AD 375-460). Fresh structures were tacked onto the ruined HL building in area C, and more evidence of a violent destruction in the mid-5th Ct AD was found (roof tiles, one stamped CGN, and more smashed African oil amphoras). Elsewhere on the site (area H) a lime kiln has been excavated, the first in Sicily of R date. The buildings at Campanaio (apart from the kilns) are of dry-stone construction with mud-brick or adobe superstructure, demonstrating that this time-honoured construction method continued in Sicily into LR times. In the LR phase (ca 375-460) there was also evidence for iron-work- ing and possible leather production (if the huge cess-pit was used in tanning). There was also manufacture on site of tiles, mortaria and amphoras, represented by a huge dump of wasters dumped ca AD 400 in the disused lime kiln. The amphoras are variants of the flat-bottomed Keay 52, produc- tion of which is known also at Sicilian Naxos and at three sites in the toe of Calabria. All this activity came to a violent end ca AD 460, with vivid destruction levels everywhere, possibly the result of Vandal attack (attested in the sources at this date-Campanaio lies only 5km from the S coast). After this there was modest spasmodic reoccupation ca AD 500 before life at Campanaio petered out. Somewhere, however, a modest later settlement of Arab or Arabo-Norman date awaits discovery, its presence indicated by three human inhumations (lying on their sides, supposedly facing Mecca) on the eastern edge of Campanaio. One is of a juvenile (12-15 years), of indeterminate sex; teeth marks indicate sustained malnutrition before the child was seven. The other two were male, aged 25-35. One had had a tumour in his jaw surgically removed, the other had suffered chronic toothache: the teeth in the left lower mandible were much more worn than those on the other side-he had clearly been chewing all his food on one side to avoid pain. The abnormal thickness of both adult male skulls (and cavities in them) indicate that both suffered from anaemia: thalassaemia is still endemic in Sicily today. Ovicaprids are most numerous in the bone assemblages, followed by pig and cattle; horse, dog, hedgehog, hare, tortoise and duck are also represented. Of particular interest is the quantity of deer bones (second only to ovicaprids in 5th-centu- ry-AD deposits), not only of red and roe deer, but also of fal- low deer, very rare on Mediterranean sites, leading to specula- tion as to whether fallow deer were originally indigenous to southern Italy/Sicily. Interim results are published in PBSR 68 (2000) 337-69 and Antiquity 74 (2000) 289-290; a monograph is in prepara- tion.' F. Maurici (Archeologia Medievale 23 [1996] 597-602) has published two Arab tombstones discovered on the surface at Monte della Giudecca near Cattolica Eraclea and, in doing so, discusses its pre- and post-Arab history, including its life as a Byz fortress. We now have a full length history, from PR to modem times, of the hot-springs of Sciacca on the coast further to the W by the local history enthusiast and physiotherapist G. Verde, II termalismo di Sciacca dalla preistoria al XX secolo (Agrigento 2000) (cf. also his contribution in Cura aquarum, 181-4). After a five-year intermission, another season of excava- tion has taken place at Montagnoli near Menfi, a site further to the W of Sciacca, and only about 6km E of anc. Selinous (G. Castellana, Atti elimi III, 263-71; cf. AR 1995-96, 90). In 1997 work continued to the SE of hut 1 uncovered in 1991, revealing another hut (7), roughly rectangular in shape with an elongated oval annex at one end. Hut 7 is 7.85 x 6m, enclosed</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 183 by a wall 1.25-1.45m thick; in the interior, entered from the S, a cooking area and seat-like bench, in parts covered with clay, were found; traces of wall plaster have also been recovered. There is very little evidence of the roof structure, and the exca- vators are rightly hesitant to attempt its reconstruction. Fine 7th-Ct-BC native wares were found in abundance, including large amphoras doubtless meant to store agricultural goods, and a hydria with two letters (I and M) inscribed on its base. The sense of these letters cannot at present be recovered. It is hypothesized that hut 7 may have been the home of an elite member of the community and that (unspecified) political and religious activities took place under his roof. Ample signs of burning caused by violent actions were encountered all around this hut, confirming previous conclusions that the native settle- ment here was destroyed in connection with the foundation of Selinous. The evidence continues to grow for a return of pop- ulation (of Elymian origin?) to the site in the mid-6th Ct, as revealed by various finds, including a rectangular structure constructed on the ruins of hut 7. Three useful summaries of previous work at Cannatello (AR 1995-96, 89) have appeared, all by E. De Miro (Hommage Vallet, 71-81; Studi BBPC, 439-49, in E. De Miro et al., Atti e memorie del secondo congresso internazionale di Micenologia, Roma-Napoli, 14-20 ottobre 1991 III [Rome 1996] 995-1011). Similarly, the studies that have resulted from work at Milena discussed in previous reports (AR 1995-96, 89) have been handily reprinted in a single volume by V. La Rosa (ed.), Dalle capanne alle robbe: la storia lunga di Milocca-Milena (Milena 1997) (cf. the notice by S.M. Thompson, AJA 102 [1998] 460). The ground-breaking work of G. Castellana and collabora- tors on the prehistory of Agrigento province continues to pro- duce astounding results (AR 1995-96, 89). At Monte Grande, there have been some new excavations in addition to the pub- lication of older investigations. Results of the latter have now been fully published in a handsome volume entitled II santu- ario castellucciano di Monte Grande e l'approvigionamento dello zolfo nel Mediterraneo nell'eta del bronzo (Palermo 1998) (reviewed by S.S. Lukesh, AJA 105 [2001] 134-5). Castellana has also authored a useful summary stressing the site's Aegean connections in Studi BBPC (423-38). The results of the new excavations have been promptly and care- fully published in La cultura del Medio Bronzo nell 'agrigenti- no ed i rapporti con il mondo miceneo (Palermo 2000) (here- after: Cultura del MBA). In 1997 and 1998, excavations extending over an area of some 350m2 were carried out in the BA industrial zone at Baffo Calcarone, revealing seven new ovens with canals for the liquid sulphur (Fig. 29). The ovens are distributed in horseshoe fashion, taking into account the nature of the terrain. Fragments of Castelluccian and Aegean plain and coarse pottery were discovered in levels containing traces of burning. Work nearby in localita San Francesco brought to light an anc. sulphur mine on the SE slopes of Monte Grande, an area where some extremely important ceramic finds have been made. About twenty sherds of late MH wheel-turned wares were uncovered, belonging to vessels of medium-small dimen- sions, in all likelihood of open shapes, produced on Melos in the Cyclades. One of the sherds has a boat on it, for which the excavators see parallels with the representations on the Thera fresco and Minoan proto- and neopalatial seals and tablets (Fig. 30). Investigators also discovered hereabouts a retaining wall of the R period (Antonine?), together with some fragments of tegulae sulfuris. The BA settlement associated with the mine was located nearby at Marcatuzzo, where three structures have been found on a levelled area; two of these, labelled ,' .'-',. ~' ~ - ' . ' ' :' ~ tr~.I' ... 29. Monte Grande, Baffo Calcarone: sulphur oven 30. Monte Grande, San Francesco: potsherd 'megara', are rectangular (8.9 x 7.45m), whereas the third is circular (max. di. 9.1m) with 'dromos' entrance. All three structures are surrounded by an enclosure wall, outside which was found a circular hut of the Castelluccian period with some imported Aegean pottey of LH I-II date. Yet another circular Castelluccian hut with LH I-II pottery was uncovered in 1999 in contrada Vicinzina's predio Rume. All these new discov- eries, along with those previously made, provide more infor- mation on an ever-expanding chapter on trade in the Shaft Grave period with the prehistoric Agrigentino. This trade, judging from ceramic finds, seems to have been in the hands of traders from Melos and Aegina, whose pottery is known from other sites in the region. The amazing discoveries do not stop there. In contrada Capreria near Sant'Angelo Muxaro, a wealthy LBA burial, of the first half of the 12th Ct BC, has come to light in a grotto some 15-20m below the surface (Cultura del MBA, 212-37). This naturally formed karst cavity, with just room enough for a person to stand upright, contained the skeletal remains of two individuals, one a child under the age of 10 and the other an adult, physically strong, who died between the ages of 20 and 25. The grave-goods accompanying the latter consisted of two Pantalica North amphoras, two bronze bowls, two bronze swords, and a Cypriot light-on-dark cup. The bronze items are of Cypriot or Cypriot-inspired manufacture; one of the bowls has a parallel at Enkomi (Fig. 31). Given the nature of these grave-goods and their recipient's physical strength, the exca- vators have plausibly hypothesized that we may be dealing with an elite warrior engaged in trade with the E Mediterranean. In any case, this find represents valuable new evidence of the earliest phases of the tombs carved into the hillside at Sant'Angelo Muxaro. There are two further devel- opments to report on this site. A conference was held in 1996 on Sant'Angelo Muxaro and its region, with the proceedings</page><page sequence="40">184 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 0~~~~~~~~: ' , , _» MuCM 31. Sant'Angelo Muxaro: bronze bowl appearing as Natura, mito, storia nel regno sicano di Kokalos. Atti del convegno, S. Angelo Muxaro, 25-27 ottobre 1996 (Canicatti 1999). The second involves the republication by D. Palermo (CdA 24-25 [1985-86 (2000)]) of the excavations undertaken in the tombs of Sant'Angelo Muxaro by Orsi and collaborators. On the prehistory of the region, we may also note that two final publications have appeared of other projects directed by G. Castellana at Ciavolaro and grotta Ticchiara: La stipe votiva del Ciavolaro nel quadro del Bronzo Antico siciliano (Palermo 1996), and La grotta Ticchiara ed il castellucciano agrigentino (Agrigento 1997). Elsewhere (Cultura del MBA, 61) DNA analysis of the Ticchiara burials has revealed close contacts with the E Mediterranean in the 2nd millennium BC. On native settlements and cemeteries in the Platani and Salso river-valleys (with particular reference to the important sites of Polizzello, Sabucina, and Valle Oscura di Marianopoli), there are articles in the Magna Grecia e Sicilia volume by E. De Miro (187-93) and G. Fiorentini (195-201). De Miro notes how native settlements in the area adopted rec- tangular and rectilinear buildings in the late 7th/early 6th Cts BC as a result of contact with neighbouring Gr peoples. With regard to Monte Adranone, we have the catalogue of an exhibition featuring material uncovered in previous report periods: G. Fiorentini, Monte Adranone: mostra archeologica, Sambuca di Sicilia, 23 aprile 1998 (Sambuca 1998). Also by Fiorentini is a useful round-up of what is known of the site's urban and architectural development from A to HL times (Studi Gullini, 67-78). A further season of work has taken place at the anc. hill-top town located on Monte Raffe (S. Lagona, in P.L. Dall'Aglio (ed.), Terras...situmque earum quaerit: studi in memoria di Nereo Alfieri [Bologna 1999] 74-7; cf. AR 1995-96, 92). In 1995 native material of the Sant'Angelo Muxaro-Polizzello culture was found underneath previously excavated 4th-Ct-BC houses. The building labelled a basilica by a previous excava- tor (P. Griffo) is now thought to have been a public building of C date. Underneath this building, another rock-cut sanctuary has come to light, with an altar partly excavated into the rock, benches lining its sides and a poorly-preserved entrance on its S side. The votive offerings retrieved consist of statuettes of Demeter, vases, and lamps. Part of a road running E-W along a terrace was also uncovered. As regards the site's anc. toponym, G. Manganaro has suggested that Monte Raffe was home to the Kimissaioi whose ethnic is found on some silver litra coins (in U. Fellmeth and H. Sonnabend (eds.), Alte Geschichte: Wege, Einsichten, Horizonte. Festschrift fur Eckart Olshausen zum 60. Geburtstag [Hildesheim 1998] 131-42). The opening of the new museum at Licata (cf. AR 1995-96, 90) has been accompanied by a guide by P. Meli, II Museo Archeologico di Licata (Agrigento 1995). The many seasons of excavations at Monte Saraceno di Ravanusa have now seen final form in A. Calderone et al., Monte Saraceno di Ravanusa: un ventennio di ricerche e studi [QuadMess suppl. vol.] (Messenia 1996). There is also a wel- come attempt to understand the complex issue of Greek-native interaction at the site by A. Calderone (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 203-12). The author interprets the new urban quarter on the upper terrace as having been home to 700-900 people, some of whom doubtless came from nearby Akragas. Elites of native and Gr origin, moreover, are thought to have intermarried and forged ties of other kinds, creating new identities over the course of time. At first, the native elite alone adopted Gr cul- ture, which in turn increased the symbolic value of their status; then, at a later date, Hellenization spread to the other classes, forever changing the site's character. D. Adamesteanu, the excavator of Butera in the 1950s, has published some thoughts on the status of this important anc. site in the 7th Ct BC (Atti e Memorie della Societd Magna Grecia [1994-95 (1996)] 109-17). He argues that Butera was a Geloan sub-colony for a brief period, populated with settlers who had originally come from Prinias in Crete. Two glossy general surveys on Gela were published in the same year: 'Gela,' suppl. to Kalos 11.1 (1999), and G. Chiaramonte, Ai confini del mare: un viaggio di ritorno a Gela nei tempi e nei luoghi del Mediterraneo (Palermo 1999). On the native presence in the Gela area prior to the arrival of the Rhodians and Cretans, we have a succinct overview by C. Raccuia (Magna Grecia e Sicilia, 321-30). Much of the remaining material to report from Gela derives from the recent Festschrift in honour of Piero Orlandini, one of the site's long- time excavators (cf. Studi Orlandini). M. Pizzo (157-68) presents some new material relating to Gela's foundation. In 1996, during restoration work on the Benedictine monastery, situated NE of the city centre on the present-day via Damaggio, four small trenches were opened by the Caltanisetta Superinten-dency. Areas 3 and 4 in particular revealed Gr pottery (mainly cups, krateriskoi, kotylai, and hydriai) dating from the last two decades of the 8th to the mid- 7th Cts BC. Amongst this material is a fragment of a PCor kotyle with herons (Fig. 32). As Pizzo has pointed out, this provides further ammunition for the idea of a pre-colonial predecessor to Gela and adds another dimension to its earliest topography which, judging from these finds, may have con- 32. Gela: kotyle fragment</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 185 sisted of small concentrations of people spread over the entire area enclosed by the later A city wall. In another contribution, A.M. Ardovino (169-87) compares the cults of Demeter at Gela and Posidoneia, the two Western Greek sites with the most evidence, finding similarities and differences. F. Cordano (189-93) highlights the propaganda of Deinomenid origin in the 'Lindian Chronicle.' E. De Miro (307-21) pub- lishes a bf lekythos of the Gela Painter found during con- struction works in 1985, in an area of the anc. city previously recognized as belonging to a cemetery. The lekythos dates to the last decade of the 6th Ct BC, and on it is depicted a potter's workshop with six individuals engaged in clay working and firing. As De Miro notes, the painter seems to be following C conventions, as found in Aristotle (Politics i.1254a): the slaves are robust from physical work, and the others are slim and agile, with bodies not suited to hard work, but to politics and administration. Elsewhere, but still relating to pottery, the figured Cor kotylai are well published by C. Ingoglia, Le kotylai corinzie figurate a Gela [Quaderni del Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, Italia, vol. 2] (Roma 1999). J. de la Geniere (Hommage Vallet, 121-30) posits the existence of Etruscan/Campanian mercenaries in the cemeteries of Gela through the evidence of pottery. Pottery from the Navarra col- lection and the A shipwreck discovered in 1988 (cf. AR 1995-96, 98) form the bulk of the material put on display in Malta as part of an exhibition called 'Dalla Grecia a Gela a Gozo: antiche e nuove rotte' organized by the Caltanisetta Superintendency (R. Panvini, Archeologia Viva xix.81 [2000] 86-7). On the stunning Karlsruhe Nike discussed in the pre- vious report (AR 1995-96, 63), F. Gilotta (Prospettiva 98-99 [2000] 155-9) adds further arguments to W. Schiirmann's sus- picions that the piece originated in Gela. The painted ante- fixes found at Gela between 1951 and 1961 and between 1973 and 1975 have been studied by M. Castoldi, Le antefisse dip- inte di Gela: contributo allo studio delle pittura siceliota arcaica (Milan 1998). Some of the pieces contained therein had already been published elsewhere, but they are considered afresh, together with the other material. The antefixes gener- ally date to 530-480 BC, and once adorned small buildings. The material from Vassallaggi is downdated to the second half of the 5th Ct BC. Some new architectural elements (sima and geison) belonging to the temple of Athena on Gela's acropolis are studied by J. Heiden (MDAI(R) 105 [1998] 329-40), who demonstrates that they pertain to an EC structure. There are also some new thoughts by R. Panvini (AISCOM IV, 159-64) on the mosaics from the HL villa at Capo Soprano excavated in 1951 by D. Adamesteanu (NSc [1956] 343-54). For those interested in military history and topography, J. DeVoto (Ancient History Bulletin 14.1-2 [2000] 14-21) finds a more convincing explanation for the failure of some of Dionysios I's troops to cross Gela's acropolis in time in 405 BC as due not to collusion with the Carthaginian commander Himilkon, but simply to miscalculation. There are also some notes by D. Mertens (Studi Pelagatti, 320-3) on the Capo Soprano forti- fications. On Caltanisetta and environs, there are two items to report. The first is a brief article on Med Caltanisetta by S. Fiorilla (CNAM I, 36-40). The second is a longer piece on a topographic survey carried out at the hill-top site (577m asl) of Cozzo Rocca, situated some 15km NE of Caltanisetta on the right bank of the river Salso (S. Tusa et al., SicArch xxvi- ii.87-89 [1995] 39-56). This is a strategic site with a long his- tory of human occupation, from the late Copper Age to early modem times. The hill-top itself occupies a surface area of 6-7ha; a notable proportion of the ceramic and lithic material retrieved was concentrated on the W plateau. The pottery of A and C date consists of native and imported Gr wares (recog- nizable are kylikes and Attic bg). It is likely that Cozzo Rocca had been fortified in these periods, but no traces of this or any other walls from inside the presumed circuit were visible to the surveyors, although some of the stones lying on the ground almost certainly had once belonged to them. WESTERN SICILY Provinces of Palermo and Trapani On Palermo several general works which include the anc. and medieval periods have appeared: G. Blandi, Palermo: storia dello sviluppo urbanistico della cittd dalle origini all'etd con- temporanea (Palermo 1998); 0. Cancila, Palermo (Rome 1999) (2nd edition, first published 1988); C. De Seta et al., Palermo: citta d'arte. guida ai monumenti di Palermo e Monreale (Palermo 1998); R. La Duca (dir.), Storia di Palermo (Palermo 1999-) (each vol. with video and CD-ROM); G. Limonta, Palermo (Milano 1999); A. Muccioli, Le strade di Palermo. storia, curiositd e personaggi di una cittd attraverso la guida alfabetica completa delle sue vie (Rome 1998). We now also have the full catalogue from the exhibition on the Phoenicio-Punic city mentioned in the previous report (AR 1995-96, 101): C.A. Di Stefano (ed.), Palermo punica: Museo Archeologico Regionale Antonio Salinas, 6 dicembre 1995-30 settembre 1996 (Palermo 1998), containing excellent papers by the leading specialists on a wide range of topics and materials, from history of settlement to palaeoethnobotany (earlier ver- sions of some contributions have been aired elsewhere: Archeologia e territorio, 483; Atti elimi, 587-94; Studi Moscati, 679-94; Wohnbauforschung, 19-28). On the name of the Phoenicio-Punic city, G. Garbini (Studi Moscati, 201-7) investigates the inhabitants' preference for the Greek name Panhormos, and explains it by pointing out that the name pro- vided a double meaning in both the Greek and Phoenician lan- guages that had benefits for the obviously bilingual world in which this city operated. Of a summing-up nature are two works by I. Tamburello on the Portella di Mare necropolis (ASNP25 [1995] 61-85; cf. also Atti elimi III, 957-61), and on Punic-R material outside the city wall (Rivista di Studi Fenici 24 [1996] 103-17). Some more excavation has occurred in Caserma Turkory (C.A. Di Stefano, Archeologia e territorio, 483; Atti elimi III, 437-49; cf. AR 1995-96, 101-2). Excavations in 1996 and 1997 brought to light 35 new tombs, which, together with 43 found in earlier investigations, brings the total to 78 so far. Of the new tombs, 7 are chamber tombs, 13 are cremations in pits cut into the earth, 7 are inhumations in stone sarcophagi, 5 are cremations in urns, and 3 are enchytrismoi. One of the cre- mations in earth pits (tomb 66) belonged to an adult male interred with iron sword and spearhead, and several iron and bronze rings on his fingers. Oak, wild prune, and almond were used as fuel to cremate the body. The inhumations in the stone sarcophagi were reserved for children. One of these burials (tomb 63) is particularly rich, with a necklace of glass beads, two pendants in polychrome glass, an amulet, and feed- er found in it. The oldest chamber tomb discovered in this group is tomb 46 with 'dromos' sealed by stone slabs; MCor and LCor pottery was found inside it. New in the list of ceramic imports is some early Etruscan bucchero (Rasmussen type 7) and a cup with human face in Etrusco-Corinthian. Restudy of tomb groups discovered in 1953 also revealed another such cup. Some small-scale excavations took place in 1992 at Piazza Vittoria. The work was primarily intended to explore archaeo-</page><page sequence="42">186 FRANCO DE ANGELIS logically untouched areas, especially around build- ing B, and generally to get more background on the earlier excavations during the 19th and 20th Cts which revealed, among other things, the well- I- known mosaic with hunting scene (C.A. Di Stefano, Archeologia e territorio, 484-5, and AIS- COM IV, 7-18). The new discoveries include a Doric capital with plaster facing and traces of red [ t paint, perhaps belonging originally to the second column of the W flank of building B. There is also a notch cut into the capital's echinus, leading to the hypothesis that the intercolumnation of the build- ing's long flanks had been sealed with walls with windows in them. Di Stefano concludes that the mosaic with hunting scene, which is associated with this building, cannot have been made after the mid-2nd Ct BC. - We have further details of the excavations that ---- ----.. took place in 1992 (cf. AR 1995-96, 102) on Monte Pellegrino (anc. Heirkte), the promontory 33. Termir just on the outskirts of Palermo (C.A. Di Stefano et al., Archeologia e territorio, 3-24; L. Gandolfo, Atti elimi III, 533-46). Excavations in the Piano della Grotta area revealed traces of human activity from the end of the 3rd Ct BC to 5th Ct AD, with particularly intense activity in the middle to late R imperial period. The oldest phase of occupation belongs to the first half of the 3rd Ct BC, as dated by Punic coins and bg pottery; no structures associated with this phase have so far been found. To the R period belong some walls and an ovoid building, along with numerous pottery and coin finds, among them various types of amphoras (such as Graeco-Italic, possi- bly represented by Will's shapes A and D; Dressel 1B and 20; and others of N African and Ostian production) and coins of Panhormos, Tiberius, and Hadrian from stratified deposits (a first, as the excavators point out, since all previous coin finds emerged from chance or illegal discoveries). In addition to these excavations, we have another work on Monte Pellegrino's Carthaginian military camps and other anc. settle- ment remains by the energetic V. Giustolisi, Panormus III.I. Monte Pellegrino: i campi militari cartaginesi e gli altri antichi insediamenti (Palermo 1996). The so-called 'Acquasanta' Punic stele is re-examined by R. De Simone (Archeologia e territorio, 447-50), who argues that the inscription is of the 3rd Ct BC, a slightly higher date than previously thought, and of stone and style that is more at home in N Africa, perhaps more specifical- ly in Carthage, than on Monte Pellegrino, where the stone is said to have been found. If so, De Simone observes, the stele cannot be taken as evidence, as it sometimes is, for a tophet on the hill- top. Further outside the city, in the Palermitano, we have stud- ies by G. Pottino (Archivio Storico Siciliano 20 [1994 (1997)] 5-16) on the discovery of military camps of the First Punic War to the S of Punta Raisi (where the airport is now located), and by C.A. Di Stefano (Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 453-62) on LR remains from across the entire province. On Med archaeology, from both Palermo and its region, we may begin with the publication of some finds from muse- um collections and from the excavations from underneath the main post office in Quaderni del Museo Archeologico Regionale 'Antonio Salinas'3 (1997). An extremely important province-wide overview of Med settlements known from doc- umentary sources is provided by F. Maurici, L'insediamento medievale nel territorio della Provincia di Palermo. Inventario preliminare degli abitati attestati dalle fonti d'archivio (secoli XI-XVI) (Palermo 1998). There is also an article by the same author on Byz sites in the Palermitano from IjT 11f- , - -- -------- - ;y+e'ffi' -'''', ni Imerese site archaeological and written sources (Archivio Storico Siciliano 20 [1994 (1997)] 27-93). Articles on later Med remains have appeared in AISCOM IV (333-42, 343-64), Archeologia e ter- ritorio (361-74, 375-89, 391-414, 485-6), CNAM I (109-15, 181-6, 206-10, 422-7), and Atti elimi III (731-46). At Solunto some new excavations have taken place in the kilns mentioned in the last report, while the bulk of archaeo- logical activity has been devoted to the publication of the Punic necropolis explored in previous years (cf. AR 1995-96, 102; C. Greco, SicArch xxviii.87-89 [1995] 93-5; A. Termini, SicArch xxviii.87-89 [1995] 97-106; C. Greco, Archeologia e territo- rio, 487-8, Wohnbauforschung, 97-111). More and more evi- dence is coming to light that the kilns were used in the 4th and 3rd Cts BC after the site had been abandoned (C. Greco, Atti elimi III, 681-700). The ceramic material found in these new excavations consists mainly of Phoenicio-Punic wares, but there is some Gr and native material as well, which provides evidence of the range of contacts maintained. A stele re-used in one of the kilns has strong parallels with tophet contexts elsewhere in the Central Mediterranean, and it is possible that the tophet is to be found nearby, although future work in its likeliest location may prove unfruitful given its built-up nature. One or possibly two PR tombs (of the late Copper Age or EBA) have been discovered in the area of kiln Fl. The study of material previously excavated from the necropolis has been comprehensively carried out by various scholars under the direction of C. Greco in Archeologia e ter- ritorio (25-110). A. Termini's (35-55) study of the Phoenicio- Punic pottery reveals that it makes up 16% of the total ceram- ic material recovered from the necropolis, and consists of 76.5% open shapes (cups and plates the most common) and 23.5% closed shapes (unguentaria most common). Gr pottery, both imported and imitated, is also well represented at almost 30% of the total ceramic finds (V. Tardo 75-93); most of the material is bg. The Gr transport amphoras are published by C. Polizzi (95-103), who reveals that the two most frequent types are Ionic-Massaliot and Graeco-Italic, representing, respec- tively, almost 38% and 23% of the total. Two of the amphoras have inscribed signs (cross and K), and probably represent some kind of commerical values. Study of material outside the necropolis has continued. On the theatre, there is now the monograph by A. Wiegand, Das Theater von Solunt: ein besonderer Skenentyp des spdthellenismus auf Sizilien [DAI Sonderschriften 12] (Mainz 1997) (reviewed by E.R.

Despite Solunto's strong Hellenizing tendencies, as demonstrated by the latter monument, V. Tusa (Studi Orlandini, 369-75) reminds us, through an analysis of its reli- gious architecture and associated practices, that the core of the city's population was Punic. On floors in opus signinum and geometric tessellation found throughout Solunto, there is now a work by C. Greco (AISCOM IV, 39-62). Further to the SE of Solunto, along the present-day river San Leonardo, is the strategically placed native and later Punic hill-top town of Cozzo Sannita. D. Lauro (Archeologia e ter- ritorio, 349-60) reviews the archaeology of the site and includes some of her own surface work. On the summit and middle terrace of the hill there are numerous fragments of tile, undecorated pottery, amphoras, and pithoi so big that they had to be left in situ. In connection with the latter, Lauro makes the interesting observation that they testify to the site's agricultur- al roles besides the obvious strategic ones. During restoration work in 1996 in the church of Santa Caterina d'Alessandria at Termini Imerese, the opportunity arose to carry out some small-scale excavations (A. Burgio, Archeologia e territorio, 237-47). Parts of four LHL buldings, labelled A-D by the excavators, were found (Fig. 33). Building A may have had a public function. Some earlier pot- tery of the 5th Ct BC also came to light, raising the possibility that further excavations could someday provide foundation- period material. The buildings follow another orientation in the town plan and thus provide further tantalizing clues on its design. In other work, A. Burgio (AISCOM IV, 379-84) revis- its all the known classical mosaics with a useful summary of information and helpful insights, and 0. Belvedere studies the Barratina siphon of the Aqua Corelia (Cura aquarum, 105-7). At Caccamo, about 6km to the S, G. Mannino (SicArch xxxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 141-63) reviews the archaeological dis- coveries made over the years and reports on surface work which he conducted as far back as thirty years ago at various sites hereabouts. In contrade Noce and Sughero, two ECh tombs were discovered, one of them associated with a nearby settlement. Two Med sites have been also been located, one in Cozzo Casale (occupying a surface area of about 1 ha) and the other in Pizzo Pipitone, where some native pottery of the 6th5th Cts BC was also found. Further to the E on the coast is Himera, where the study of new and old material continues to enrichen our knowledge of the city. N. Allegro and N. Bonacasa (Wohnbauforschung, 55-64 and 65-80) usefully review the main features in the development of the settlement, raising two points that deserve particular attention: first, that the gap between Diodoros' foundation-date and the earliest Gr ceramic material has now been filled (cf. also S. Vassallo, Wohnbauforschung, 85-8) and second, that there is growing evidence for possibly some kind of violent destruction at Himera around 580-570 BC, on the heels of which the town plan was reorganized (cf. also Allegro, Archeologia e territorio, 251-65). The study of the city's religious monuments is also moving ahead. Three new groups of acroteria (14 fragments in all) from the temple precinct in the NE comer of the acropolis have been studied by N. Bonacasa (Studi Orlandini, 297-306, and in M.C. Lentini (ed.), Naxos a quarant'anni dall'inizio degli scavi. Atti della tavola rotonda, Giardini Naxos 26-27 ottobre 1995 [Naxos 1998] 131-40). These high-quality pieces include marine animals and an equestrian group, and date to 550-425 BC. This material will also be included in the forthcoming work by N. Allegro (ed.), Himera 111.2: le aree sacre. Campagne di scavo 1973-1989 (Rome), announced as immi- nent in the previous report (AR 1995-96, 105), but apparently still in preparation. 34. Himera site From elsewhere in the upper town, we have the publication by N. Allegro (Studi Pelagatti, 39-49) of a hoard of agricultur- al iron tools found in a hole opened by clandestini in the far eastern part of block IV near the N-S road. The hoard consists of eight items (4 ploughshares, 2 hoes, 1 double-headed axe and 1 hatchet) and was probably buried just before the Carthaginian sack of the city. After analyzing the pieces, Allegro goes on to speculate whether the rarity of iron farm tools before the mid- 7th Ct amongst the Sicilian Greeks as a whole is an indication that they came not with initial foundation but with the intense economic and demographic growth that came at this later date. More excavations have taken place in the lower town (S. Vassallo, Wohnbauforschung, 81-90). In an area 58 x 28m, some elements of the town plan were found, with blocks ori- ented N-S, including median lines, 40m across (Fig. 34). Four rooms, identified as andrones, have also been brought to light, with pavement flooring and plaster walls (on the plan, they are nos. VIII and X in the E block and nos. I and XIV in the W block). Each room could have probably accommodated four klinai. The rooms are dated to the last quarter of the 5th Ct BC (to before the Carthaginian sack of the city). Also from the lower town is an early Sth-Ct Cor palmette antefix found in 1984 in the debris of a house destroyed by the Carthaginians (E. Epifanio Vanni, Studi Pelagatti, 110-4). Another season of excavation occurred in 1996 in the Pestavecchia necropolis on the property of the Royal Imera Hotel (S. Vassallo, Archeologia e territorio, 489-90). About another 100 tombs have been discovered, mostly dating to the late 6th and 5th Cts BC, located approximately 100m away from the previous concentration. The tomb types belong to primary cremations and inhumations 'alla cappuccina', with some enchytrismoi as well. One of the inhumations 'alla cappucci- na' contained two indivduals, a male and a female (perhaps husband and wife) with their hands joined and the male's left leg on her legs, which the excavators take to represent the intense affection they had for each other in life. The publica- tion of material recovered from this necropolis is also under way: there are studies by M. Butera (Archeologia e territorio, 465-9) on the stamnoi and S. Vassallo (forthcoming in Kokalos) on the transport amphoras. In the area of epigraphy, the single most noteworthy item to report is the publication of the law on the redistribution of land (A. Brugnone, PdP 52 [1997] 262-305, Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 579-86, with comments by G. Manganaro, Atti elimi III, 748-52) (Fig. 35). It was found in the area of temple D, and was probably affixed to the door of that structure or to a 'billboard' somewhere closeby. The inscription dates to the end of the 6th/early 5th Cts BC, and deals with the redistribution of land in the context of the phratry which registered such information on behalf of the civic body. Further work on landscape archaeology is being planned for Himera's territory (O. Belvedere, Wohnbauforschung,</page><page sequence="44">188 FRANCO DE ANGELIS Five km to the NE is the hill-top town of Polizzi Generosa. On the pre-Norman history of the site, we have C. Salamone Cristodaro, Polizzi prenormanna: il silenzio storico (Palermo 1998). On the archaeological front, A. Tullio (Archeologia e territorio, 267-74) reports on five seasons of excavations in the HL necropolis in contrada San Pietro to the E of the modem town (some of this work has already been reported: AR 1995-96, 110). More than 200 tombs, all of them intact, have been explored. The main burial rite is primary cre- mation in earth fossae, sometimes crowned by epitymbia. Some inhumations and cremations in amphoras are also known amongst the earliest tombs, but the numbers are small. The tombs are oriented NW-SE, with a slight (perhaps insignifi- cant) E-W tilting for the inhumations. Heads, where identifi- able, always face SE or E. Three chronological phases have been recognized, from the mid-4th to 2nd Cts BC. Monumental burials with various types of epitymbia characterize the first two phases. Examples of the latter include tombs 34, 36, and 46, conspicuous by their rectangular platforms and large dimensions (Fig. 38). One more season of excavation took place in 1999 at the PR site of I Faraglioni (AR 1995-96, 106) on the island of Ustica (the main report has been published electronically on the web- site of Brown University's Center for Old World Archaeology and Art, at http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Old_World Archaeology_and_Art/Publications/ustica/report.html; see also R.R. Holloway and S.S. Lukesh, AJA 105 [2001] 286). Work L Restauro integr.vo 35. Himera: inscription 91-61, and in S. Quilici Gigli (ed.), Uomo, acqua e paesaggio [Rome 1997] 285-7). Meanwhile, that kind of work is being complemented by advances in the settlement archaeology, of which, for the A period, S. Vassallo (Kokalos 42 [1996] 199-223) has provided an excellent overview. Future plans to build an archaeological park and new antiquaria are outlined by N. Bonacasa (Wohnbauforschung, 55-64). The R villa at Settefrati near Cefalu, known from news- paper reports since the 1970s, was investigated by the Palermo Superintendency (cf. three works by S. Vassallo: Archeologia e territorio, 491; Kalos 9.2 [1997] 38-41; AIS- COM IV, 63-72). Some bg pottery found there suggests human activity in the HL period. Better represented is the mid-imperial period during which the villa flourished. Parts of two mosaics were recovered: one with white, black and grey tesserae, and the other polychro- matic (Figs. 36-37). In the absence of proper excavations, a tentative date of the 3rd Ct AD, or early decades of the 4th Ct AD, has been sug- gested. At nearby Cefalui, S. Vassallo (Archeologia e territorio, 491-2) returns to the megalithic build- ing on the Rocca di Cefalu explored earlier in the century by P. Marconi. Vassallo questions its iden- tification as a protohistoric structure, thinking it more likely that it dates to Med times. The city's pre-Norman mosaics have been studied recently by A. Tullio (AISCOM IV, 73-84). LR material was discovered in 1994 some 25-30km inland at the small town of Castellana Sicula during construction of a public green space (D. Pancucci, Archeologia e territorio, 492-3). The anc. material is spread over three terraces (803-821m asl). On the highest of these terraces pottery and a brickworks of the 4th-5th Cts AD were discovered. I . 0 - OOc =_ + + .+ + 36, 37. Settefrati: mosaics i ! i _ _ -.-- , . '-- -'------- 1 ' ' !

Polizzi Generosa: tombs continued on the inside of the fortifications, in the area located between the trenches opened up in pre- vious years. These investigations have brought to light parts of a supporting glacis adjacent to room 12, a house against the inner face of the fortifica- tion, and also an annex to the house, which backed onto the street and appeared almost subterranean. Room 14, another house, was discovered to the SW of the latter and is approximately 2.75m wide and 4m long; a large pithos, showing signs of repair, was found in one of its comers (both houses can be seen on Fig. 39). Trial trenching intended to explore the density of intramural habitation also brought to light a casting mould for a bronze adze. Suggestions regarding the interpretation of the site as a whole have also been put forth (R.R. Holloway and S. Lukesh, Archeologia e territorio, 455-60). The excavators see strong parallels with the Myc citadels of the Aegean, with their low population densities inside hefty walls (Fig. 40) and their cult places on heights. In connection with cult, serious doubts have recently been raised as to the authenticity of the tufo sculpture of a woman (Fig. 41); these are stated in full in G. Mannino, Ustica (Palermo, 1997). It is apparently rumoured that the sculpture is a modem forgery, a hoax by a group of youngsters; how seri- ously this rumour should be taken remains to be seen, but for the time being we may enjoy the sculpture, whatever its status, illus- trated in these Sicilian reports for the first time. In the waters around Isola delle Femmine, just off the Sicilian mainland midway between the city of Palermo and its airport at Punta Raisi, material of A to Med date, particularly amphoras and anchors, has been recovered (S. Tusa, Archeologia Subacquea 2 [1997] 65-73). One of the anchors, thought to be of the 6th Ct BC, has three holes in it and two Gr letters, I and E in ligature, and another of similar type had traces of wooden flukes still inside the holes. Another season of exploration took place in 1997 in the Skerki Bank (R.D. Bullard et al., Deep-Sea Research 47 39. Ustica: houses 41. Ustica: tufo sculpture 40. Ustica: wall</page><page sequence="46">190 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 42. Monte Iato: skyphos [2000] 1591-1620; A.M. McCann, AJA 105 [2001] 293-4). Four new wrecks (labelled 'Skerki D-G') were found: wrecks D, F, and G are of R date; wreck D is of the first half of the 1 st Ct BC. Dressel 1 amphoras are the most common find. Wreck F has the heaviest load of the merchant ships found to date, containing building stone from Aswan roughed out for columns, amphoras containing various sorts of products (wine, oil, and fish-sauce) and kitchen wares of all kinds still stacked on the sea-bed. The University of Zurich excavations at Monte Iato have continued to reveal interesting material (for the results of work conducted in the previous reporting report, see AR 1995-96, 107-9). Prof. H.P. Isler, project director, reports on the latest finds: 'There have been annual excavation campaigns at Monte Iato, each lasting five weeks, between the years 1996 and 2000. Work concentrated on the agora, the sacred area NE of peristyle house 1, the late A house with courtyard, peristyle house 2, and on a sector of the eastern HL quarter. In the SW agora, the first phase of a N-S oriented oikos temple was brought to light. The building, which consists of two parts, dates to around 470 BC. It was refurbished on the same foundations, but at a higher level, at the same time as the construction of the agora around 300 BC. The latter rests, on the S side, on an earth spoil which covers earlier buildings par- 43. Monte Iato: laconicum tially exposed by excavation. These buildings are probably single-room structures of late A date. Some rooms on the S edge of the agora were also discovered; two of them were fit- ted with opus signinum (cocciopesto) floors and walls decorat- ed with red and white stucco. It is not clear whether these rooms, which include a banquet area, belonged to the public or private sphere. Further to the W, one of the rooms was trans- formed, probably in late republican times, into a thermopolium with paved flooring in front of the trapeza and a small oven which would have been used to re-heat food. Among the most important finds of the last few years in the W quarter is a late A house with courtyard built around 500 BC and destroyed for a first time around 475 BC. In its east- ern part at least, the house is comprised of two storeys, the upper room containing a banquet area. Some of the items used for symposia were retrieved; among them are native pots, cups of colonial manufacture, and even some bf and rfAttic pottery, including a kylix with bathing hetaira, an eye cup with youths and cocks, and a skyphos (Fig. 42) of the Heron class with rep- resentation, repeated on two sides, of an Athenian citizen accompanied by his wife who is being greeted by the goddess Athena in person, in a most unusual scene. The religious struc- ture NE of peristyle house 1 is now dated to the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC, soon after the construction of the house itself. It had a predecessor dated to ca 480-470 BC, destroyed when the house was built. Excavation of peristyle house 2 is still under way. Its peristyle consists of four columns by five columns. The front part of the house, re-used in Med times, is unfortu- nately poorly preserved; on its W side, the exedra between two andrones was uncovered, its floor made of hard lime and opus signinum (cocciopesto). Two neighbouring peristyle houses in the E quarter, El and E2, are presently under investigation. They flank the paved street which led from the E city gate to the monumental centre with the agora and theatre. House E2 had a particular terraced plan and a bathing room, added later, with a laconicum of circular plan that is well preserved (Fig. 43). Burnt rocks were found in a terracotta casing located in the centre, which, when heated, would have been used to make steam. A complete bibliography on the excavations of Monte Iato up to 2000 can be found in H.P. Isler, Monte Iato: guida arche- ologica2 (Palermo 2000). Three volume of the series Studia Ietina are devoted the now complete publication of peristyle house 1.' In addition to the foregoing field-work, publication and study of previously uncovered material from Monte Iato has also been active. The 13 specimens of lithics, mainly obsidian and flint, discovered in the first 26 seasons of work are the sub- ject of a brief article by Isler (Archeologia e territorio, 451-4), as are the mosaics and other decorated flooring (AISCOM IV, 19-32). There are five articles on Monte Iato in the Wohnbauforschung volume: A. Cutroni Tusa (13-8) looks at Monte Iato's coins from a Sicilian wide perspective; Isler (29-35) summarizes the HL period; E. Kistler (37-44) and J. Fuchs (45-8) present preliminary reports on the late A and peristyle 2 houses; and D. Kach (49-54) provides a potted his- tory of pottery imports. Still on the pottery, Isler elsewhere (Studi Orlandini, 143-56) considers the oldest Greek imports at Monte Iato, which consist mainly of shapes used in the sym- posium, and argues that Selinous was the chief supplier of these wares. There is another contribution by Isler on a cup by the Painter of the Agora Chairias cups (Antike Kunst 41 [1998] 3-16). On epigraphy, there are two works to note: Isler (Sicilia epigraphica, 393-405) publishes inscribed sling-stones, and M. Biirge (ZPE 129 [2000] 84-88) publishes an inscription of the last quarter of the 4th Ct BC, on what appears to be a frag-</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 191 ment of a column krater. The inscription, surviving in nineteen letters, may be referring to Dionysos in iambic dimeter. We might also mention the glossy overview of the Monte Iato excavations, together with details of the archaeological park and museum created in recent years to accompany them, by H.P. Isler and F. Spatafora, Archeologia Viva xvi.63 (1997) 60-8. On Partinico, some 12km to the NW, there is a local histo- ry, from anc. to Arab times, written by L. D'Asaro, Nel regno di Cocalo: da Inico a Partinico, da Camico ad Al-Qamaq (Palermo 1997). As the title clearly proclaims, the author believes that Kokalos' kingdom is to be found in the region, contrary to general opinion which places it around Caltabellotta or Sant'Angelo Muxaro. Nevertheless this is a welcome work by a local enthusiast containing discussions of already known documentary sources, as well as known and unknown archaeo- logical material (mostly lithic and ceramic), some of which he and others have collected over the years (including an Attic bf fragment of an individual carrying a pot published as pl. 35 on p. 82). With reference to Alcamo, 15km to the SW, A. Filippi has put together the results of several years of topographic survey in the surrounding countryside, revealing a total of forty sites and concentrations of artefacts, particularly pottery, ranging from PR to Med times in Antichi insediamenti nel territorio di Alcamo (Alcamo 1996). The location of anc. Petra is hypothesized by M. Gargini (Atti elimi II, 799-806) to have been located on Monte Pietroso. It might be appropriate to mention here that V. Giustolisi has recently placed this same anc. toponym several kilometres to the E in the municipal district of Castronuovo (Petra [Palermo 2000], reviewed by E. Joly, Archeologia Viva xix.89 [2000] 92-3). Study of the material uncovered during many seasons of work at Entella continues. The late G. Nenci (Archeologia e territorio, 496-7) has published a synopsis of excavations that were previously reported on. As regards the now famous Entella Tablets, the most important new develop- ment to report is that tablet VII has been shown, beyond rea- sonable doubt, to be a 20th-Ct forgery (W.T. Loomis, Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 96 [1994] 127-60; G. Nenci, Archeologia e territorio, 508). Elsewhere in the epigraphic sphere, A. Bemab6 (Sicilia epigraphica, 53-63) restudies an Orphic text from a private Swiss collection orig- inally published in summary fashion (J. Frel, Eirene 30 [1994] 183-4). On the urban development of Entella, there is an overview by G. Nenci (Wohnbauforschung, 125-30). A second LA kiln in the area of the necropolis is discussed by R. Guglielmino (Atti elimi III, 701-13), providing further evi- dence of the link between the two, as with the Kerameikos at Athens. In another contribution, Guglielmino (Atti elimi II, 923-56) has examined Hellenization, which had an immense impact on such things as urbanism. The sources and nature of the stone used in buildings at Entella are studied by I. Gennusa (Atti elimi II, 845-64). C. Michelini (Archeologia e territorio, 461-3) has investigated a limestone block with triglyph motif that was discovered in 1985 on the surface before excavations commenced on the HL granary and has since disappeared. The block, she argues, is not a boundary marker from the nearby agora, but a statue base which once stood either in the open or inside some public building. The votive deposit discovered in the foundations of this HL granary has now been studied by M.C. Parra (Atti elimi II, 1203-14). In the sphere of econom- ics, M.G. Canzanella (Atti elimi II, 251-90) has published a lengthy study of the many millstones of lava-stone found at the site, and in another lengthy work meant to accompany the lat- ter, D. Daniele (Atti elimi II, 465-524) has shown, through trace element analysis, that the lava-stone came from numer- ous sources both inside and outside the island, including from as far away as the Aegean. Entella's faunal remains have been studied by E. Bedini (Atti elimi II, 957-78), who reveals among the sample several different animals (pigs, sheep-goat, bovines, equines and chicken), both wild and domesticated. Among the results we may note that, at the time of butchering, pigs were two years and older and bovines between the ages of two and four; the bovines were mainly used as work animals, while the pigs were raised for meat. S. Frey-Kupper (Atti elimi III, 479-98) examines the 203 coins (162 of them anc.) found in excavations at Entella between 1984 and 1997. On HL and Med dental wear in the surviving skeletal populations, we have a fascinating little study by P.F. Fabbri and E. Camieri (Atti elimi II, 595-612). Even the Med castle at Pizzo della Regina is now receiving attention (S. Gelichi, Atti elimi III, 635-53). The new anti- quarium at Entella mentioned in the previous report (AR 1995-96, 109) now has a handy guidebook by M.C. Parra (ed.), Antiquarium di Entella: guida del museo (Contessa Entellina 1997) (for an overview of the antiquarium and its contents, see also A. Italia, SicArch xxxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 233-8). There has been a concerted attempt to study the hill-top town of Corleone to the NE. The anc. Corleonese has a rich history which goes back deep into prehistory, as shown by recent and past archaeological research (A. Vintaloro and A. Scuderi, Corleone archeologica I: studi storico-archeologici sul territorio [Corleone 1995]; A. Scuderi et al., La preistoria e la protostoria nel Corleonese e nello Jato [Corleone 1997]; F. Spatafora, Atti elimi II, 1273-86). Excavations at Cozzo Spolentino and topographic surveys all over the anc. site have revealed a native settlement on the plateau itself (25-30ha) larger than previously thought (F. Spatafora, Archeologia Viva xv.59 [1996] 34-40; Archeologia e territorio, 498-9). The set- tlement, naturally fortified, began its life in later prehistory, and continued down to the 3rd Ct BC. An Attic rf kylix of the 5th Ct BC, with what seems to be a representation of an athlete, was recovered from a tomb in the A-C necropolis. Another Attic rf pot, a lekythos with female figure, and other imported Gr pottery (like bg) are reported as well. Excavations also revealed some early HL structures, some showing signs of destruction. One of these has thick walls and three pithoi in its interior, perhaps intended to store foodstuffs. A Byz kiln or big hearth was also uncovered, with ceramic jugs and bottles found in the vicinity. This is important evidence, as the Byz period is still poorly documented in Central Western Sicily. There is also a study of the coins from local collections and the topo- graphic survey work undertaken between 1990 and 1995 in A. Cutroni Tusa et al., Rinvenimenti di monete e circolazione monetaria nel territorio di Corleone: primo bilancio (Corleone 1997). The explorations at Montagna dei Cavalli that appeared in the previous report (AR 1995-96, 111-2) have now been pub- lished in greater detail by the team led by S. Vassallo (Archeologia e territorio, 275-335; Atti elimi II, 791-8). The only new work to report is an important field survey by P. Giordano (Archeologia e territorio, 337-48). This multi-period survey discovered 62 sites and scatters in an area of 150km2. Two new PR sites have been located, and after the abandonment of Montagna dei Cavalli, the largest and chief settlement in the region, in the mid-3rd Ct BC, the countryside starts to be popu- lated in a way not seen before. These rural sites are not situat-</page><page sequence="48">192 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 45. Montagnola di Marineo: lamp base 44. Montagnola di Marineo: fortifications ed with a view to defence, but are intended to maximize agri- cultural exploitation. With the Arab invasions, these open sites in the plains were abandoned in favour of the defensible heights. On the anc. name of the site at Montagna dei Cavalli, it is increasingly becoming indisputable that it is to be identi- fied with Hippana. G. Manganaro (Orbis Terrarum 3 [1997] 127-30) adds another piece to the toponymic puzzle in pub- lishing a kerykeion said to have been found there with the word and letters AAMOION IIA inscribed on it. Some very important new excavations have been undertak- en at Castronuovo di Sicilia, yet another hill-top site located some 15km to the E (A. Villa, Atti elimi II, 1385-98). These have revealed glimpses of native huts of the 6th Ct BC, but by far the most important discovery has been that the fortifications, previously thought to be of C date, have now been shown, through stratigraphic excavation, to have been Byz (7th-8th Cts AD). The building identified by F.S. Cavallari as a temple may have rather been a Byz military barracks. Grottos of Byz date are also known from the area, which, when combined with these new excavations, establish beyond doubt that there was Byz settlement here. F. Maurici (Atti elimi III, 755-76), the noted medievalist, has been quick to sketch out the strategic importance and uniqueness of this site in Byz Sicily. The research conducted between 1991 and 1993 at Montagnola di Marineo, another hill-top town about 26km to the N, that was briefly mentioned in the last report (AR 1995-96, 112), has been more fully published in this period (F. Spatafora et al., Archeologia e territorio, 111-56; F. Spatafora, Atti elimi III, 895-918). We now have detailed studies of the settlement excavations, including in-depth treatments of the pottery, coins, and other small finds; this material has also been admirably placed in its larger topographic and historic context. What this work reveals is that we are dealing with a strategic and natural- ly fortified site, with which no anc. toponym can yet be associ- ated with certainty, at the crossroads for N-S traffic along a nav- igable river. As such, the site was a lightning-rod for all the political thunder and lightning that swept through this part of the island in antiquity. On the hill-top, five areas have been opened up. The anc. layers are covered by later Med remains. The old- est of the anc. material is native and Gr imported pottery of the late 7th Ct BC; no structures associated with this A (or even later C) settlement have come to light. They may have been destroyed by the extensive HL town which followed, as seems likely, since all of the pre-HL material was found out of context. Various structures and a stretch of the fortification system of this town have been investigated (Fig. 44). The latter has a width varying between 1.4 and 2m, and a maximum preserved height 46. Montagnola di Marineo: Julio-Claudian glass gem of 1.7m. Some of its limestone blocks are up to im long; the various courses of the wall are separated by other grey limestone blocks, creating an aesthetically stimulating effect. The destruc- tion and collapse layers associated with this wall date to the late 4th to first half of the 3rd Cts BC. Closeby, on the inside of the wall, investigations have also been directed at a building with what seem to have been silos. Among the small finds from the settlement excavations, we might note a bg lamp on the base of which is the name Heraios, whose work was well known at Delos and at Western Sicilian sites (Fig. 45). Also noteworthy is a Julio-Claudian glass gem, one of the few anc. items later than the main period of occupation to have been found (Fig. 46). At Colle Madore, another native hill-top settlement in the environs of Lercara Friddi, the work and finds briefly mentioned in the last report (AR 1995-96, 112) have indeed been amplified (S. Vassallo, Archeologia e territorio, 499-500, and more fully in Vassallo (ed.), Colle Madore: un caso di ellenizzazione in terra sicana [Palermo 1999]). Two seasons of excavations have taken place (in 1995 and 1998), and have concentrated on the summit and south slope. Colle Madore's livelihood was most certainly derived, then as it was in later times, from agriculture in the fertile hinterland, and from the extraction of mineral resources, particularly sulphur, abundant because the site is on the margins of Nisseno's great sulphur basin. Although PR material (mainly pottery, but also moulds for metal-working) is not abundant, it suggests that human occpuation began in the EBA, and continued thereafter into the MBA and LBA. The main period of development occurs in the 7th Ct, when there is evidence on the summit for a sacred structure, possibly circular in plan (di. 8-10m), of the sort that has been found at Polizzello</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 193 /arDA 47. Colle Madore: south slope of hill (cf. AR 1995-96, 90-2). In and around this was a votive pit con- taining ash and bone (ox, sheep/goat, and pig of medium-large dimensions); the animals were probably sacrificed and cooked here. In the third quarter of the 6th Ct this structure was replaced by another circular one, in the middle of which was a rectangu- lar feature perhaps used as a roof support. Lower down the hill, on the S slope, are other buildings of the same period accessed by pathways (Fig. 47). On the lower terrace is a metal-working area, the centre of which appears to be rooms III/IV with seven small ovens of fired clay on a slightly higher platform (20-25cm) (Fig. 48). There are ample signs of burning all over, as well as large pithoi in situ and fragments of lead. Large pithoi were also found in neighbouring rooms. On the terrace above are the remains of a sacellum of rectangular plan (7 x 9m) ori- ented E-W and entered from the S. In its interior are the foundations of two stone benches, one run- ning the entire length of the N wall, and the other in the middle of the E wall, on which cult objects were placed, the most notable being the sandstone relief depicting Herakles with his foot on an amphora - mentioned very briefly in the preceding report (Fig. 49). The relief is 33cm high, on a base 19 x 11cm. Other finds made inside and outside the sacellum I include two native pithoi, four Gr transport c amphoras (Cor A, Samian, and two Western Greek), L--- a louterion, two E Greek lekythoi, and several bronze sheets and belts with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic decoration (Fig. 50). The sacellum was roofed with tiles and palmette antefixes. In general, the sacellum illustrates the progressive Hellenization of Colle Madore from various direc- tions (particularly Himera and Akragas); there was also contact with the Phoenician settlements on the coast. The multicultural world to which Colle Madore belonged is tantalizingly revealed by the dis- covery of a Western Greek amphora with a / Phoenicio-Punic inscription scratched on its neck after firing. Another work on Colle Madore deserv- .- ing our attention is the history of the site by the late local enthusiast, C. Romano, who drew Colle Madore to the attention of the Palermo Superintendency in the first place: Storia, mito e leggenda del sito sicano di Colle Madore (Lercara Friddi 1998). Study of the LR necropolis excavated by the Palermo Superintendency at S. Agata di Piana d'Albanesi (AR 1995-96, 113) continues with the publication of the glass finds by C. Greco (Quaderni del Museo Archeologico Regionale 'Antonio Salinas'2 [1996] 115-29). 48. Colle There has been further exploration and study of the native hill-top settlement on Monte Maranfusa (F. Spatafora, Archeologia e territorio, 497-8; Wohnbauforschung, 151-64). As elsewhere on the island, a change in the uses and design of native domestic space can be seen in the mid-6th Ct BC: circular huts randomly scattered throughout the settlement gave way to rectangular buildings in an organized plan, perhaps accompa- nied by social change. Two more houses have been investigated (Fig. 51). House 1, the southernmost of the excavated group, dates to the late 6th/early 5th Cts BC. It consists of three rooms (A-C), which occupy a surface area of 40m2 (of which 22-23m2 could be considered actual living space). Room A has been iden- tified as the kitchen, with a bench along its S wall and three amphoras on its floor; rooms B-C are reminiscent of the Grpas- tas house, but with obvious differences that must not be over- looked. House 2 is larger and more elaborate, consisting of at least five rooms (D-F, H, and Q) occupying a surface area of 135m2 (of which no more than 75m2 served as living space). No clay tiles have been found in this house, making it likely that its roof was made of some kind of ephemeral material. Rooms F and G contained evidence of food preparation represented by a mill-stone and round clay plates subdivided into four pie-slice parts. The latter is also found in MBA Thapsos domestic con- texts, thus providing evidence of the continuity of cultural tradi- tions over several centuries. Loom-weights discovered in room H make it likely that it was used to produce textiles. Overall, the mid-6th Ct BC at Monte Maranfusa, as elsewhere in the region (cf. F. Spatafora, Kokalos 42 [1996] 177-98), witnesses the adoption of Greek-style architectural models, perhaps associated with changes in the social and economic use of space itself.

E Elymian city (for work in the previous period, cf. AR 1995-96, 115-8). Among the more general historical and archaeolog- +j ical works, there are recent articles by F. Frisone and G. Bruno Sunseri in Atti elimi III (499-515 and 181-97) on, respective- ly, hero cult and Agathokles' attempt to transform the city into a Dikaiopolis. With regard to the toponyms 'Segesta' and 'Calatafimi', the late G. Nenci devotes a highly insightful arti- i cle (in C. Montapaone (ed.), L'incidenza dell'antico: studi in memoria di Ettore Lepore III [Naples 1996] 479-88). Nenci has noted a toponymic move after the R conquest, away from c - Aegesta to Segesta, because of the latter's overtones with region's agricultural abundance. As for Calatafimi, Nenci - ; + ..'. - agrees that its name is derived from two different sources, the Arab 'Calata' meaning castle and 'al fimi' referring to the anc. domains of a certain Euphemius. Nenci connects the latter , individual with the wealthy landowner Diocles Phimes men- tioned in Cicero (Verrines 11.3.92-3), and estimates his land holdings hereabouts to have been in the order of 515ha. Moving on to more archaeological matters, what is known of the city's anc. remains is recorded in detail in R. Camerata 51. Monte Maranfusa: houses</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 195 and Wohnbauforschung, 131-9; D. Daniele, Atti elimi III, 327-56; D. Daniele et al. in F. Guidobaldi and A. Paribeni (eds.), Atti del V colloquio dell'Associazione Italiana per lo Studio e la Conservazione del Mosaico (Roma, 3-6 novembre 1997) [Ravenna 1998] 451-64). Stratigraphic excavation seems to confirm the date proposed for it by the late G. Nenci (late 2nd/early 1 t Cts BC). A house altar and kitchen have also been identified (Fig. 52). We might also note the more gener- al work on HL decorated floors by R. Camerata Scovazzo (AISCOMIV, 107-22). There are further thoughts on the sig- nificance of the finds from Grotta Vanella by J. de la Geniere (Atti elimi II, 1029-38). Another notable discovery is a HL necropolis (probably post-Agathokles), the first of this date to be uncovered at Segesta (B. Bechtold, Atti elimi III, 79-90; Kontaktzonen, 401-9). The necropolis is located at the foot of the hill with the famous Doric temple. An area of some 10,000m2 was investi- gated in 1996 and 1997, revealing 135 burials, primarily inhu- mations, though some primary and secondary cremations have been found as well. The inhumations were in pits cut into the earth, and backfilled with the spoil, whereas the primary cre- mations were in pits and the secondary cremations in pits and urns. About 85% of the burials are oriented N-S, or in slight variations from that, and in 70% of cases the head was placed to the S, SSW, or SSE. Where known, more than 40% of cra- nia faced E, 25% faced frontally, and in little more than 20% of cases they faced W. The variety of burial rite is interpreted as having its origins in a mixed population; in any case, a full range of population was buried in the necropolis, from children to adults. More than 90% of the burials have grave-goods, with the cremations generally slightly better stocked than the inhumations. Some 1,100 objects have been recovered, of which about 1,000 are within the standard range of ceramics that one finds in burials of the time. Advances in epigraphy have also been made. L. Biondi (Atti elimi III, 135-51) publishes some new Elymian texts, and in doing so reflects more generally on the Elymian language, emphasizing its Italic base. There is a lengthy study on ampho- ra stamps (from Entella, Erice, and Segesta) by B. Garozzo in Sicilia epigraphica (281-383), and elsewhere in the same work C. Michelini (439-48) gives a brief study of Segestan inscrip- tions re-used as building material. There are also some case studies of material culture. On amphoras and terra sigillata, we have studies by M. Denaro and A. Mandruzzato, (Atti elimi II, 537-48 and 1059-70). C.A. Di Noto (Atti elimi II, 581-6) looks at the bronzes from the contrada Mango sanctuary, and A. Cutroni Tusa (Atti elimi III, 317-25) at the 'Cacciatore' coins. Two seasons (1995 and 1996) of a multi-period systematic field survey have taken place in the surrounding countryside (M. Aprosio et al., CNAM I, 187-93; S. Berardini et al., Atti elimi III, 91-133). Some 360 sites and surface scatters were dis- covered in an area of approximately 45km2. The following ten- tative results have been reached. C material is sparse and restricted to the immediate area around the city. In the HL peri- od, a dispersed population resident in the countryside in settle- ments of small to medium dimensions (not specified more exact- ly) seems to have developed. Such intensive exploitation of the countryside coincided, as the investigators have observed, with Segesta's urban development (like the theatre). In the early R period the trend was towards concentrating population in settle- ments on the valley floors and on lower hill slopes in open con- ditions. In some areas, settlement density increases in LR times with the appeareance of some new sites (one of them, probably that of a village, occupying a surface area of some 90,000m2). Byz occupation of some of these new sites is also in evidence. ',' .nf PKI .'iAS dS 11| ij1 :d 1,,„ .1,4 52. Segesta: house For the Med period, we can note the publication of A. Molinari's outstanding work on the castle and mosque in Segesta II: il castello e la moschea (scavi 1989-1995) (Palermo 1997). The place of Erice in the Elymian koinon between the 6th and 4th Cts BC has been examined by S.N. Consolo Langher (Atti elimi III, 287-310). There are observations on the A city wall by V. Tusa (Atti elimi III, 979-81) and A. Filippi (SicArch xxxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 165-84) has analysed the later fortifica- tions midway up the hill constructed during the First Punic War. On the plateau of San Matteo, Filippi's topographic sur- vey has uncovered fragments of Punic amphoras (Mafia C and D) and numerous ballista balls made of limestone. A possible fortified look-out post and tower were also found in the vicin- ity, as well as the remains of the Carthaginian camps near the landing of Crocifissello down in the plain below. The castel- lum built by the R commander Junius is located at Rocce del Calderaro. For the Med period in Erice and region, F. Maurici has a useful round-up of sites, many discovered through his own efforts, in Atti elimi II (1121-38). For the island city of Motya, there is a new history by the journalist and history enthusiast G. Servadio, Motya: unearthing a lost civilization (London 2000). Some new excavations have taken place near the G. Whitaker Museum in 'zone E' of the anc. settlement, a situation made pos- sible by the restoration work to the building's foundations (M.L. Fama and M.P. Toti, Wohnbauforschung, 113-23, Atti elimi III, 451-78; M.L. Fama, Atti elimi II, 643-54). Parts of three city blocks were uncovered in two seasons of excavation (Fig. 53). The oldest finds consist of pottery</page><page sequence="52">196 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 1 6.i *I 4 r- r~~~~~~~~~~~~. 1 0. 53. Motya: city blocks 54. Motya: limestone relief and reconstruction and burnt animal bones of EBA and MBA date (cf. F. Spatafora, Atti elimi III, 919-56), but most of the material belongs to the 7th to 4th Cts BC. Two houses with beaten earth floors, a small industrial area with small kilns, and pos- sibly a public building have been identified. There is much Phoenician red slip ware, as well as a rim fragment of an Attic SOS amphora. Among the Phoenician commercial amphoras found in the so-called 'Casa delle Anfore' in 'zone A', M.P. Toti (Atti elimi II, 1297-1304) notes a variation of the Mafia C class in respect of the profile of the lip and in the shape of the body. Domestic life in this same zone is stud- ied by G. Rossoni and P. Vecchio (Atti elimi III, 879-94). From elsewhere in the anc. settlement, A. Ciasca (Studi Moscati, 629-37) publishes a fragmentary limestone relief found in 1965 in the tophet (Fig. 54). The fragment (h. 0.27/0.28m, w. 0.34/0.35m, th. 0.08m) depicts winged sphinxes on either side of a throne; on stylistic grounds, a date in the late 6th/early5th Cts BC is put forward. The func- tion of the relief remains unknown, but it is not likely to have been used as an altar, as no burnt material was encountered in the find area. Ciasca hypothesizes that it may have once held some kind of betyl or statue. On Motya's industrial area, we have a useful overview by V. Tusa (Studi Moscati, 1003-19), one of the site's past exca- vators, and another such overview on the port by M.L. Fama (SicArch xxviii.87-89 [1995] 171-80). On the Birgi necropolis, on the mainland opposite Motya, M.G. Griffo (Atti elimi II, 909-21) expresses doubts as to whether this was a Phoenician burial ground, arguing instead that its burial practices and inscriptions indicate a Gr popula- tion. Also regarding burial, M.J. Becker (SicArch xxxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 7-12) examines a deposit of human bones from the settlement, accounting for their presence by physical relo- cation. The study of finds from earlier investigations has contin- ued. An endless source of fascination in this regard is the mar- ble statue, the so-called 'Motya Boy' (AR 1995-96, 118-9). In a small monograph, cited but unavailable to my predecessor, C.O. Pavese argues that the statue once belonged a charioteer monument set up in 476 BC by Theron, tyrant of Akragas, to commemorate his Olympic victory, and that it came to Motya as booty after destruction of the city by Carthage (L 'auriga di Mozia [Studia Archaeologica 81] [Rome 1996], reviewed by E. Bartman, AJA 102 [1998] 645-6). In other contributions, M. Bell (MAAR 40 [1995] 1-42) argues that the piece may have been made by an Athenian to commemorate Emmenid chariot victories in the 470s BC, while M. Denti (RA [1997] 107-28) strengthens the case for a charioteer by adducing numerous par- allels and speculates that the sculpture was commissioned by Hieron of Syracuse and sculpted by Onatas of Aegina. From excavations in 'zone A', we have two studies in Atti elimi II by G. Rossoni (1249-54) on an ivory with floral decoration and by P. Vecchio (1378-84) on a fragmentary scarab depicting Horus. On coroplastics, M. Albertocchi (Studi Orlandini, 355-68) studies the female divinity wearing a necklace of seeds ('col- lane di semi'), wondering if their meaning is to be associated with fecundity. There is a lengthy and thorough work on the amphora stamps from the Whitaker Collection by B. Garozzo (Atti elimi III, 547-633). For those interested in the site's mosaics, there are two papers in AISCOMIV(137-46, 147-58). To the S at Marsala (anc. Lilybaion/Lilybaeum), there is the projected three-volume history of the city and surrounding countryside (of which only two have so far appeared) by G. Alagna, Marsala (Palermo 1998-). On the anc. toponym of Lilybaion, D. Musti (Studi Moscati, 337-42) argues that the name is a Greek interpretation of a Semitic root meaning 'house of Aphrodite' or 'Aphrodite mistress of the sanctuary.' The Greeks, probably in the 5th Ct BC owing to the Athens- Segesta alliance, made an association between Aphrodite and Boutes, who was then prominent in Athenian circles. Lilybaion's tophet is placed by E. Caruso (Atti elimi III, 217-62) at 'Timpone di S. Antonio' situated to the S of the anc. city, outside the settlement area close to the sea. The site has been covered over since the mid-19th Ct, and all that survives of it today are some stelai. Most of the other work to report concerns the anc. necrop- oleis, our knowledge of which is reviewed by B. Bechtold and M. Becker (ASNP 25 [1995] 87-187). Elsewhere Bechtold has published a superb study of tombs excavated between 1987 and 1992 by the Trapani Superintendency: La necropoli di Lilybaeum (Palermo 1999). The demolition of an old building on the 'Via Massimo D'Azeglio' revealed a spectacular quad- rangular hypogeum with painted walls and mosaic floors of the R period, with six burials, entered via a dromos (R. Giglio, Lilibeo: l'ipogeo dipinto di Crispia Salvia [Palermo 19961; Archeologia Viva xv.60 [1996] 18-25; AISCOM IV, 123-36; Atti elimi III, 655-80). One of the tombs belonged to a certain Crispia Salvia. </page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 197 The last item to report concerns the famous Punic ship. The fiasco surrounding its lack of proper long-term preserva- tion has been brought to the attention of the wider academic public by L. Basch, IJNA 26 (1997) 79-81, who bids the ship adieu if something is not done quickly to reverse the present situation. The PR necropolis at Mokarta, just to the SW of Salemi, has its final publication by G. Mannino and F. Spatafora, Mokarta: la necropoli di Cresta di Gallo [Quaderni del Museo Archeologico Regionale 'Antonio Salinas' suppl. to vol. 1] (Palermo 1995). Work has resumed at the nearby hill-top native town on Monte Polizzo situated some 6km NW of Salemi. V. Tusa undertook one season of excavation here in 1970, bringing to light the remains of several rectilinear buildings (cf. BTCGI x.435). In 1996 S. Tusa (Trapani Superintendency) and K. Kristiansen (University of Gothenburg) began the Sicilian- Scandinavian Archaeological Project in the Monte Polizzo area, which under their guidance has expanded to include teams from the University of Oslo in Norway (directed by C. Prescott) and from Northern Illinois and Stanford Universities in the United States (directed respectively by M.J. Kolb and I. Morris) (a project website is located at http://dig.anthro.niu.edu/sicily/sic_home.htm). The results are being prepared for publication, and the following tentative conclusions have been reached. The Stanford team has focused its excavations on the upper and lower acropolis (areas A and B) (a preliminary report of its 2000 activities will be published in MAAR 46 [2001]). On the upper acropolis, investigations have revealed a badly disturbed ritual area used from the late 6th Ct to 300 BC. Several structures, including possibly a tower, have come to light. Alongside native pottery, there are imported Gr cups and wine amphoras, as well as Punic material (four bronze coins and a votive stele) of the 4th Ct BC. Work on the lower acropolis has uncovered several rec- tilinear structures with IA (6th Ct onwards) and Norman occu- pation. The IA structures are on the same alignment as those excavated some 70m away by V. Tusa in 1970. The Oslo exca- vations have concentrated on three points on the lower slopes in areas where bulldozing of fire-breaks by the Forestry Service has exposed archaeological remains; preliminary results of the 1998 season have appeared in a privately circu- lated document by C. Prescott et al., Sicilian-Scandinavian Archaeological Project: Annual Report 1998 (Oslo, 2001). The remains of houses and a stratified pottery sequence have been discovered. Considerable attention has been devoted to house 1 built in the first half of the 6th Ct BC, some of whose rooms show signs of burning. Much incised native IA wares were found in this house. The team from Northern Illinois University has focused its efforts primarily on a field survey of the surrounding countryside, especially in a 30km2 area between Mokarta and Monte Polizzo. Some 12-14km2 have been intensively surveyed, bringing to light many new sites and scatters (the PR survey material will be published in Antiquity 76 [2001]). The R period is particularly abundant, with kilns, quarries, and villas coming to light. The Northern Illinois team has also done some minor excavations: near Mokarta three PR burials (1 Copper Age/EBA and 2 LBA) were excavated after being exposed during agricultural works; in Salemi, a small trench (2 x 5m) was opened up in the old town during the 2001 season, revealing what appears to be a retaining wall/staircase and pottery of the 6th to 4th Cts BC (in addition to Med, Renaissance, and moder layers). It is already clear that these new archaeological explorations at Monte Polizzo and environs will provide much new informa- tion for the study of anc. Western Sicily, perhaps even throw- ing light on the location of anc. Halikyai known from written sources. For the Gibellina area, G. Falsone and G. Mannino (Atti elimi II, 613-41) discuss three rupestrian necropoleis of PR and A date. As the authors have rightly stressed, necropoleis of these periods are so far rare for Western Sicily, and so this work is a valuable contribution which takes the discussion a step fur- ther along. The final publication of earlier work at the BA site of Marcita (AR 1987-88, 143-4), W of Castelvetrano, has now appeared in a nicely produced volume by S. Tusa et al., L'insediamento dell'etd del bronzo con bicchiere compani- forme di Marcita: Castelvetrano (Trapani) (Trapani 1997). A new tombstone came to light during agricultural or road works near Campobello di Mazara, some 6km to the SW (G. Nenci, ASNP 25 [1995] 1329-31). The stone (88 x 57cm) dates to the last quarter of the 7th Ct BC. The name of the deceased is EIBEAOI, which Nenci suspects as being possibly of Elymian origin. In any case, this tombstone provides more evidence of Selinous' precocious penetration, up the Mazara river-valley into the hinterland, in the first generation of its existence. At Mazara del Vallo on the coast, R. Giglio (SicArch xxxi.96 [1998 (2000)] 49-57) reports on the small-scale exca- vations that recently took place during building works. In the Palazzo Cavalieri di Malta, close to the site of the anc. port, traces of anc. buildings of various dates, from C to EMed, have been investigated. Some of the 4th-Ct BC structures are thought to have belonged to the Punic commercial installa- tions. Elsewhere a building with mosaic flooring of late impe- rial date has also been revealed. On top of this building are others of LR date (4th-7th Cts AD), which are oriented in accor- dance with the E bank of the river Mazaro. There is also a post-hole (of uncertain date) cut into the floor of the previous building. There are new investigations and studies to report from the spectacular city-site of Selinous a further 20km to the E, as the crow flies. We may begin with the few historical works that have appeared. There is now a general work on the Gr city by S. Elia, Arte e civiltd di Selinunte: urbanistica, culti, arte, let- teratura, vita sociale ed economica dell'estrema colonia occi- dentale della Sicilia greca (Castelvetrano and Selinunte 1999). On the foundation period of the city, L. Braccesi (Kokalos 41 [1995] 339-44) examines the meaning of the verb katoikizein in Thucydides (vi.3.5). Braccesi takes it to mean 'to re-establish' or 'to re-populate' and connects this verb with two waves of set- tlement at Selinous, the first led by Pammilos and the second by an oikist from Megara Nisaia. Two foundation-dates for Selinous are, therefore, to be considered correct (a conclusion with which some earlier researchers concur: cf. AR 1981-82, 101; AR 1987-88, 144). In another interesting study, P. Anello investigates how Selinous' (and Himera's) position on the mar- gins of the Gr culture area in Sicily shaped its history in a sig- nificant way: in L. Braccesi (ed.), Hesperia: studi sulla greciti di Occidente X (Rome 2000) 99-115. On Selinous' later tyrants, we have two articles by F. Frisone (Atti elimi II, 729-53) and G. Maffoda (ASNP 25 [1995] 1333-43), both of whom put paid to any remaining doubts about the authenticity of these shadowy, yet important individuals, and go on to situ- ate them in their broader contexts, using the available archaeo- logical and written sources. L. Gallo (Atti elimi III, 517-3 1) has re-examined the relations between Selinous and Segesta, arriv- ing at the conclusion that modem scholars have built up a pic- ture of constant conflict that is somewhat exaggerated. These works show that the city's tyrants and geographical position provided great impetus to its urban and architectur-</page><page sequence="54">198 FRANCO DE ANGELIS 55. Selinous: sima al development, on which further archaeological studies have continued to shed light. There are several works on different parts of the anc. city by D. Mertens. In Hommage Vallet (185-93), he provides a summary account of his recent exca- vations in search of the anc. agora, and among the results he throws doubt on A. Rallo's suggestion of a third orientation in Selinous' town plan. In another work, he reports on the dis- covery of another mid-6th Ct-BC gate in the city wall to the N of street 6, close to what is estimated to have been street 11 in the town plan (D. Mertens and A. Drummer, Kokalos 49-50 [1993-94] 1479-91). Clear signs of the Carthaginian destruc- tion of Selinous have also been uncovered in these excava- tions. Turning to the well-known monuments on both suburban hills and the acropolis, we have two studies by C. Marconi on the political and cultural meaning of temples C and F's metopes (Rivista dell 'Istituto Nazionale d'Archeologia e Storia dell'Arte 18 [1995] 5-68; Il dinamismo, 121-34), while E. 0stby (Symbolae Osloenses 71 [1996] 9-33) puts together a group of three fragments from one of temple C's metopes to reveal what appears to be Orestes killing Clytaimnestra. Perhaps also connected with an archive of temple C are the cre- tulae dating to the 5th and 4th Cts BC (C. Zoppi, in M.F. Boussac and A. Inverizzi (eds.), Archives et sceaux du monde hellenistique/Archivi e sigilli nel mondo ellenistico, Torino, Villa Gualino, 13-16 gennaio 1993 [BCH suppl. vol. 29] [Paris 1996] 327-37; cf the summary of N. Cusumano, Kokalos 43-44 [1997-98] 775). On domestic architecture on the acrop- olis, we might also note here the paper abstract by D. Mertens (AJA 101 [1997] 381-2). Across the valley to temple E on the eastern hill, there are two studies to report from Studi Gullini. In the first, M.C. Conti (19-33) publishes a horizontal frontal sima, with surviving dimensions of 13 x 7cm (Fig. 55). The fabric is hard and compact; the clay is beige and contains some small inclusions. The decoration on the cavetto consists of leaves outlined in black and nuclei alternating in red outline and black nucleus. The piece once belonged to the right-hand side angle (looking at the E front of the temple); Conti esti- mates from this piece that the roof of the structure to which it had originally belonged was at an angle of about 17 degrees. The moder find context is of no help in dating the object, but stylistic analysis suggests 560-550 BC. In the second paper, N. Pagliardi (121-9) publishes six locally-produced A arule, possibly from a votive deposit of temple E. The volume by M.C. Conti et al., Selinunte III (Rome 1996) is mostly given to studies on temples F and C, as well as the metopes from tem- ple Y on the acropolis, sometimes also called the 'tempietto delle piccole metope.' The much-debated dedication from tem- ple G (Inscriptiones Graecae xiv.268) is revisited by A. Brugnone (Sicilia epigraphica, 129-39), who argues that it represents the outcome of direct consultation with the Delphic oracle. On the western hill, on the other side of the anc. city centre, M. Miles (AJA 102 [1998] 35-57) devotes a study to the propylon to the sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros, which, among other things, highlights the eclectic nature of its archi- tectural components. The A Cor pottery imports from this sanctuary have been examined by C. Dehl-von Kaenel (Miinsterische Beitrdge zur antiken Handelsgeschichte 13 [1994] 55-82; Atti Taranto XXXIV, 345-66), who emphasizes that these products arrived by conscious trade, and not casual- ly. The lex sacra presumably from the nearby sanctuary of Zeus Melikhios continues to attract reviews and comments. Works published in this period known to me are as follows: F. Cordano and R. Arena, PdP 52 (1997) 423-39; G. Camassa, Sicilia epigraphica, 141-8; M. Rausch, Minima Epigraphica et Papyrologica 3 (2000) 39-52; S. Scullion, ZPE 132 (2000) 163-71; W. Burkert, in P. Flensted-Jensen et al. (eds.), Polis and Politics: studies in ancient Greek history presented to Mogens Herman Hansen on his sixtieth birthday, August 20, 2000 (Copenhagen 2000) 207-16. The so-called temple M monument further N along this hillside has now received a much-needed full length study by L. Pompeo, II complesso architettonico del tempio M di Selinunte: analisi tecnica e sto- ria del monumento (Florence 1999). Despite the poor state of preservation of the monument, Pompeo heroically pushes ahead, putting forth several new interpretations. Temple M's plan is more likely to have been distyle in antis, though tetrastyle prostyle is also possible (Fig. 56). It was construct- ed in the second quarter of the 6th Ct BC, with a roof that may have been pitched at a 19-degree angle. The available evi- dence for the cult is thoroughly reviewed, and the convincing proposal advanced that temple M was consecrated to Herakles. On Punic Selinous, we can turn to another careful study by D. Mertens (MDAI(R) 104 [1997] 301-20), who shows, among other things, that this was more than just an outpost of the Carthaginian empire. A succinct overview of Mertens' many years of work on Gr and Punic Selinous can be found in K. Rheidt et al. (eds.), Archdologische Entdeckungen: Die Forschungen des Deutschen Archdologischen Instituts im. 20. Jahrhundert (Mainz 2000). Some new studies on the Gr necropoleis have appeared. We now have an important three-volume study of the Buffa necropolis by E. Meola, Necropoli di Selinunte, 1: Buffa (Palermo 1996-98). Through no fault of its author, publication of this excellent work was delayed by fourteen years, with the further unfortunate corollary that the text has not been upated since 1982. Nevertheless, a wealth of information is contained therein. Of the 1,268 graves studied, 514, or 40.5%, are cre- mations and 754, or 59.5%, are inhumations; 307 cremation graves and 582 inhumations had grave-goods, and the rest none. The pottery found in the burials consists of the usual imports (Cor, E Greek, and Attic) and local wares, and the shapes and functions also follow patterns observed elsewhere. Statuettes and metal-work are the other main items deposited as grave-goods, but they are encountered in a rather restricted number of graves. Those interested in the Buffa necropolis' potential for Cor pottery chronology will be disappointed: as</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN SICILY 1996-2000 199 Meola has pointed out, the earliest Cor pottery from the necropolis are a few Transitional pots, making it unlikely that many first-generation set- tlers were buried here. Meola has also observed that topography and other local factors could explain the differences between Selinous and Megara Hyblaia's burial practices-a subject of which much has recently been made (cf. AR 1995-96, 62). On the Manicalunga necropolis, there are two studies by D. Leibungut Wieland (ASNP 25 [1995] 189-218; Antike Kunst 40 [1997] 3-19) which provide an overview of the necropo- lis as part of the DANIMS project (cf. AR 1995-96, 62) and the local and imported pottery. The results of a small field survey have been published in R. Bianchi et al., Selinunte IV (Rome 1998). The survey area covers some 25km2 between the rivers Belice and Modione, on the E 1 and W respectively, and the Cave del Barone and '2r,31 the sea, on the N and S respectively. Thirty-seven sites were discovered, the great majority of them 56 Selinc interpreted as farmsteads and parts of the anc. city's larger cemeteries. Most farmsteads date to the LC/EHL and R periods; at some of the former, evidence of burial plots has been uncovered. Most interestingly, at seven farmsteads activity began in the 6th Ct BC, and in some cases may have been accompanied by burial plots, which, if true, indicates residence on the land.
