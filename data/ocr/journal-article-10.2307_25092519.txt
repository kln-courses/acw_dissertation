Moore DePaul University ABSTRACT: The concept of corporate consciousness is defined and discussed. In response to Campion and Palmer (1996), it is asserted that corporate conscious ness is not a construct related to conscientiousness or moral responsibility, but an entirely new paradigm, related to awareness and information processing; the concept is cognitive, not metaphysical. Corporate consciousness serves as a framework for understanding the current trend within organizations toward greater awareness of societal realities, and of the organization's impact within larger systems. This framework borrows heavily from the cognitive, social, and organizational psychological literature and can be understood from both micro and macro levels of analysis. Also discussed are the issues of why and how to study corporate consciousness, as well as implications for the organizational practitioner. The pursuit of clarity and the development of sound theory clearly are goals of any scholarly domain, including industrial/organizational psychology. In fact, those of us who were instrumental in presenting "Discovering Corporate Consciousness" as the theme of the 1994 Indus trial/Organizational and Organizational Behavior (IO/OB) Graduate Student Conference have found that this theme has been the subject of debate in regards to its need for clarity. Campion and Palmer (1996) have made a commendable attempt toward understanding the concept of corporate consciousness. However, we are concerned that the concept as discussed by these authors was not understood as intended. The pri mary purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the concept of corporate consciousness and to clarify any confusion regarding its definition. Social scientists habitually reject those constructs and concepts that Address correspondence to Keith A. Lavine, Department of Psychology, DePaul Univer sity, 2219 N. Kenmore, Chicago, Illinois 60614. 401 ? 1996 Human Sciences Press, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">402 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY do not present themselves to be readily measurable; at face value, this is wise practice. Campion and Palmer's (1996) articulation of corporate consciousness is that of a construct, and one that refers to a new state of moral imperative and/or conscientiousness that exists within today's or ganizations. Specifically, they define corporate consciousness as "a set of consciously held, shared values that motivate and guide individuals to act in such a manner that the interests of the corporation are balanced against its obligation to be responsible for the effects of its actions upon society, the environment, and the host of interested stakeholders." In essence, they speak of a metaphysical state in which corporations them selves are in the process of developing a conscience. Although personi fication of an organization is common practice, implying that an organi zation has the capability to reason and exercise moral judgment is highly abstract. This implication gives the definition a level of complex ity that would tend to make the concept of little use in either theory development, measurement, or organizational application. Using such a definition, it is little wonder that Campion and Palmer (1996) question the utility of investigating corporate consciousness. Our attempt, then, is not so much to argue the worth and utility of the construct as these authors define it, but to reframe the definition itself. We assert that corporate consciousness is not so much a measurable construct as it is a new paradigm, and that it is not so much metaphysical as it is cognitive. With such a reframe, utility should become evident. WHAT IS CORPORATE CONSCIOUSNESS? The Random House Dictionary (1987) defines the word "conscious" in the following ways: 1) Aware of one's own existence, thoughts, sur roundings, etc; 2) Fully aware of or sensitive to something (e.g., faults); 3) Aware of what one is doing; 4) Inwardly sensible of wrongdoing. Sim ilarly, Random House defines "consciousness" as 1) The state of being aware; 2) Awareness; 3) Full activity of the mind. lb further shed light on this subject, "conscious" is synonymous with "cognizant," "perceiv ing," "observing," and "discerning" (Random House Thesaurus, 1984). "Conscious" has such antonyms as "unaware," "ignorant," and "obliv ious." Thus, in discussing "consciousness," in the simplest sense, we are speaking of awareness and mindfulness, not of conscientiousness, moral judgment or social responsibility. Note again that corporate conscious ness is a cognitive concept, not a metaphysical one. Certainly, a trend in I/O psychology has been toward cognitive information processing models, theories, and paradigms (Lord &amp; Maher, 1991). A further issue brought forth by Campion and Palmer (1996) con cerns a corporation's ability to be mindful. These authors assert that a</page><page sequence="3">KEITH A. LAVINE AND ELNA S. MOORE 403 mind is something that belongs to an individual human being rather than an entity such as a corporation. In response, we argue that a corpo ration, by nature, is a collective of individuals. To borrow from Schnei der (1987), "the people make the place.* Thus, to say that a corporation is "conscious," in fact, is to say that collectively its individual members are in a state of awareness and mindfulness. With this definition in mind, we define corporate consciousness as: An organization's state of being 1) engaged in the active, mindful process ing of information, 2) aware of itself (strengths and improvement needs), 3) aware of the environment in which it exists, and 4) aware of the inter dependency of its subsystems. Note that parts 3 and 4 of this definition are derived from Open Systems Theory of organizations (Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978). However, the first two parts of the definition are less, if at all, emphasized in Open Systems Theory. Thus, corporate consciousness is a novel concept. "CONSCIOUSNESS1' RESEARCH It is hypothesized that a conscious organization is favorable. Re search from diverse areas of psychology supports this proposal. This re search examines consciousness from both an individual and a group/ collective perspective. Both of these perspectives are equally valid in understanding corporate consciousness in organizations, as an organiza tion is simultaneously a singular entity and a collective of individuals. Stereotyping and Prejudice A common view of this topic in the past has been that stereotyping and prejudice are automatic processes, beyond the conscious control of individuals. More recent research, however, makes a different conclu sion. Devine (1989) found that while stereotyping tends to be an auto matic process in all individuals, people differ in the way that stereotypes are thought about and expressed. More specifically, she found that low prejudiced persons are more likely than high-prejudiced persons to in hibit their automatically activated stereotype-congruent thoughts and replace them with thoughts reflecting equality and negations of the ste reotype. In other words, a conscious process takes place which prevents stereotypes from turning into prejudice or discrimination. The implica tion is that individuals who make themselves aware of their own unwar ranted biases can make more accurate judgments. Fiske and Neuberg (1990) present a model that shows judgments of others are made based on initial impressions and categorization. How ever, similar to Devine (1989), they demonstrate that when people pay</page><page sequence="4">404 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY attention and are aware, they are more likely to make accurate judg ments of others and less likely to use categorization to make their judg ments. Given the increasing need in organizations to attend to diversity related issues (Offerman &amp; Gowing, 1990), these studies have implica tions for the management of a diverse workforce. Prejudice and discrimi nation can hinder an organization's attempts to manage its workforce. Attentiveness and consciousness among employees may be a key to re ducing prejudice and discrimination, especially if it is driven by organi zational policy at large. Persuasion/Decision Making Research from the persuasion literature typically identifies two ways by which people are persuaded. One way, labeled the "central" route to persuasion, marshals systematic arguments to stimulate favor able thinking. The "central" route requires a rational, analytical, moti vated audience which undergoes a high degree of information processing (Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986). People are also influenced by the "peripheral" route to persuasion, which provides cues that trigger acceptance without much thought. The "peripheral" route requires little information processing. The "periph eral" route is highly effective in persuasion, if not more effective than the "central" route. Cialdini (1993) supports this idea using the case of an employee who accidentally raised the costs of some sale items to twice their original price, rather than cut the price in half (as had been the store owner's intention). Ironically, sales actually increased as a re sult. Cialdini (1993) explained that customers were engaged in very lit tle conscious information processing (i.e., peripheral route); they made an automatic judgment that what is "expensive" must be "good," and purchased the product as a result. While this type of persuasion is effective, it also points to the poten tial problems associated with not being folly conscious (i.e. aware). An individual who is not consciously processing information is more likely to make automatic decisions which are not as wise and informed as they would be if the individual was paying attention. The implications for organizational decision-making could be disastrous. In strategic planning, Rnney and Mitroff (1986) point out how orga nizations often create internal barriers which prevent them from mak ing wise decisions and plans. These barriers can remain below a level of conscious awareness; they are often automatic behaviors that are part of an organization's culture. Such behaviors may be explained by state ments such as "if s just the way that we do it around here." These au thors suggest using the "Organizational Self-Reflection" technique to</page><page sequence="5">KEITH A. LAVINE AND ELNAS. MOORE 405 help organizations come to a better awareness of their own consensual cognitive scripts and sch?mas which play a role in the success or failure of strategic plans. Note that the second part of the definition of corpo rate consciousness is relevant here, in that a conscious corporation is one which is self-aware. An organization must be conscious of its own strengths as well as its shortcomings in order to learn and grow, some thing recognized as being of central importance to tomorrow's organiza tions (Senge, 1990b). Performance Appraisal Another area of research where consciousness has been applied somewhat implicitly is in the organizational performance appraisal lit erature. In his seminal article, Feldman (1981) reviews the cognitive processes which are often responsible for the errors in judgment that are made when appraising one's own or another person's performance. Spe cific to the present topic, people frequently make automatic judgments of performance based on scripts or sch?mas. Hence, these judgments can become biased or distorted in some way. Accurate appraisals of perfor mance are important in order for organizations to make wise personnel decisions (e.g. promotion) and to provide motivational feedback to em ployees. Cognitive processes such as automaticity and stereotyping can limit a person's effectiveness in observing performance (Feldman, 1981). A fully conscious appraiser is able to make judgments based on a wide array of information and is not limited by cognitive processes. Certainly, individuals in organizations are continually appraising their own performance (Ashford, 1989) and may adjust their behavior or level of effort as needed. Accurate self-appraisals have important impli cations for employee motivation and for acceptance of performance feed back from others. Unfortunately, individuals are often not cognizant of enough surrounding performance information to make an accurate self appraisal, and there is a greater possibility of leniency bias (Ashford, 1989). Hence, just as with decision making, it is possible that greater consciousness (i.e. awareness) can lead to greater accuracy in appraising one's own or another's performance. Mindfulness I Self-Enhancement This body of research suggests that mindfulness is related to indi vidual well-being and personal success. Langer (1989) argues that most individuals are "mindless" in their everyday cognitions, to the degree that these cognitions do not necessitate active decision-making. This mindlessness, she argues, is limiting. However, through mindfulness, human potential can be expanded beyond previously accepted limits.</page><page sequence="6">406 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY Csikszentmihalyi (1990) posits that a requirement for happiness and optimal productivity is for people to be more conscious of the world around them, and to bring order to that consciousness. Thus, instead of passively experiencing life, Csikszentmihalyi (1990) suggests that active use should be made of the information that surrounds us in order to continue to grow and improve. In an organization, an individual who is continually striving to reach his/her full potential at work may be con stantly improving on the job, which will potentially yield organizational benefits. Langer (1989) describes the mindful individual as one who is in volved in active information processing, cognitive differentiation, and awareness of context. Although Langer (1989) asserts that we cannot be mindful of all things when making a decision, she points out that pre mature cognitive commitments can be avoided. Csikszentmihalyi (1990) describes the mindful person as one who continually creates new chal lenges for him/herself, from learning something new to improving pres ent task performance. Research has yet to create a substantive model of the relationship between mindfulness and eventual performance. How ever, it is nonetheless important to understand mindfulness as a facet of consciousness. Summary Interestingly, across these vast areas of research, there emerges a common theme: a "conscious" individual tends to be more effective, par ticularly when it comes to processing information and making accurate judgments. If one accepts the notion that an organization is a collective of individuals, then there is some validity to the hypothesis that a "con scious" corporation is likewise favorable. CRITERIA FOR THE STUDY OF CORPORATE CONSCIOUSNESS Campion and Palmer (1996) have provided a highly useful set of criteria for examining a constructs worth for investigative purposes. Al though, as previously defined, corporate consciousness speaks to a para digm or state of existence rather than a formal construct, it is still pro ductive to evaluate it against these standards. It is Important to Organizations In a sense, this criterion is fundamental to the definition of the term itself. The fundamental point of this dialogue is to make it clear that there is a significant trend within organizations that the scope of what</page><page sequence="7">KEITH A. LAVINE AND ELNA S. MOORE 407 is considered to be important has been broadened. To state that organi zations in general appear to be changing their values may be too broad of an assumption. What is clear, though, is that the awareness of soci etal realities that exist outside (and within) organization walls has im pacted their focus and priorities. It Provides Possibilities for Actionable Results This is an admirable goal in the study of any construct; it is also a formidable one. It would seem, though, that in organizational settings, results have already been taking place and will continue to do so. By providing a paradigm through which a variety of organizational trends and initiatives can be understood, corporate consciousness may provide a more systematic means for planning for constructive results. The re cent trends toward diversity initiatives constitute an excellent example. By bringing organization members to a fuller understanding of diversity and the nature of difference, automatic processing and stereotyping can be minimized (Fiske &amp; Neuberg, 1990), and a climate of acceptance of and value for diversity can take place (Watts, in press). Additionally, the results generated by such an initiative would likely have a positive im pact on other organizational issues such as team building, organiza tional commitment and felt equity. Numerous changes are taking place within organizations, but without a theoretical framework to provide a rationale for these changes, they may be seen as mere Up service or fruitless efforts. There Are a Number of Scholars Working on the Topic This is a controversial criterion. It is intuitively apparent that the study of any concept had an origin at some point. However, this criterion insinuates that it is only those ideas which already exist that are impor tant. Had Thomas Edison or Henry Ford fallen prey to such skepticism, the state of our modem society would be inconceivable. These two exam ples, though seemingly extreme, do serve to make a point. The role of research is not only to be construct-defining, but to be paradigm-break ing as well. The concept of corporate consciousness presents an entirely new paradigm for understanding organizational activity and policy, and it is important to note that this paradigm is neither speculative nor hypothetical. Rather, it is a means of providing terminology and a framework for a phenomenon that already exists, but without a name. Regardless of whether or not researchers ever reckon with and under stand this phenomenon, it must be acknowledged and labeled. And in fact, even if this framework is never fully developed, initiatives such as continuous improvement, diversity, work/family issues and the like will</page><page sequence="8">408 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY continue to exist but without a solid framework for understanding their common purpose. We bear a responsibility to not lag behind in our un derstanding of it It can also be argued that the concept is not new. As stated, corpo rate consciousness is a notion that borrows from other areas of psychol ogy (i.e. information processing and cognitive psychology, social psychol ogy? Open Systems Theory). With the assumption that any means of bridging the often large divides between these areas is beneficial, there is an added benefit of understanding this paradigm. It is reminiscent of the development of the understanding of organizational culture, which borrowed strongly from the literature'in both anthropology and soci ology. 77iere Are a Significant Number of Journals Which Publish on the Topic Interestingly, a sizable number of books and journals are publishing on various ideas and constructs which come under the corporate con sciousness umbrella. A great deal can be sourced in the current litera ture on such topics as systems thinking (McKenna, 1992; Senge, 1990a), globalization (Gunn, 1991; Vertinsky, Tse, Wehrung, &amp; Lee, 1990), diver sity (Cox &amp; Blake, 1991; Jackson, 1992; Powell, 1993), and organiza tional ethics (Coates, Jarratt, &amp; Mahaffie, 1990). Additionally, as the research on organizational change processes has developed, it has grown in scope to examine analyses on both the micro and macro levels. Al though corporate consciousness is not a paradigm of change, it is a para digm of continuous and active awareness. Would it not be beneficial to have a common framework for understanding this wide range of areas? It is of Theoretical Significance The paradigm of corporate consciousness is one of tremendous theo retical importance. It is about a fundamental paradigmatic shift in which organizations have progressed from being exclusive and narrow in view to inclusive and broad. This sort of a shift is major, and re searchers need to understand what it means. Campion and Palmer (1996) warn against personification in con struct definition. However, personification is actually quite common in the conceptualization of organizational activity. Often we make such statements as "organizations must change" or "their organization grew rapidly" or "that organization had to make some tough decisions." It is generally clear that the organization itself is not a living and breathing entity that can behave and react in such ways in a literal sense. Schnei der (1987) asserts that an organization cannot be more than the collec</page><page sequence="9">KEITH A. LAVINE AND ELNA S. MOORE 409 tive sum of those people who work within it. It does not have a life of its own, and this is fairly well understood by those who articulate organiza tional theory in anthropomorphic terms. The assertion that "organiza tions are becoming more aware" should not detract from the under standing of the concept. In a sense, the attribution of a state of awareness to an organization may be helpful in truly conceptualizing corporate consciousness. By examining awareness as understood on an individual level, it provides a useful starting point for conceptualizing it on an organization-wide level; it may bridge some micro and macro level issues well (Peiro, 1987; Staw, 1990). It should be noted that this concept has a strong overlap with Daff s (1992) notion of boundary spanning; again, the paradigm borrows some what from other theories. Daft explains that all organizations vary in their ability to span external organizational boundaries, as well as their need to do so. The corporate consciousness idea stems from the observa tion that increasingly more organizations are perceiving this need. It Should Lend Itself to Being Researched Nominal fallacy is the error of providing a definition for a concept as a justification for that concept's existence. This is not the case with cor porate consciousness. Facts and literal data reveal that there is a de monstrable trend of increased external awareness among organizations; as previously stated, the necessity of the terminology is to provide a broad label for the trend. Concepts such as organizational culture, orga nizational climate, and satisfaction are no less difficult to measure and research, yet their importance is rarely argued anymore. The corporate consciousness concept is important as well. Our intention should not necessarily be to attempt to measure and evaluate it immediately, but to acknowledge it, define it, and understand it properly. When this takes place, research that is sound and from a solid base of understanding can follow. It Should Be Intrinsically Interesting The attendance of over 300 graduate students and applied behav ioral science professionals at a conference with the theme of "Discover ing Corporate Consciousness" speaks to the provocative nature of the concept. Certainly the dedication of this journal volume to this concept indicates that it is something that is both intriguing to the scientific community and something that researchers care to understand further. Campion and Palmer (1996) indicate that the governing board of the Society for Industrial/Organizational Psychology had debated the defini tion of the concept at some length. We would further contend that such</page><page sequence="10">410 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY debate is mandatory in the progression of our understanding of it, and therefore dialogue should take place among those who are at the fore front of the advancement of our field. Corporate consciousness is at once a complex and a broad paradigm, and as previously stated, a new way of looking at current organizational activity. It is about organizational adaptability and response, the knowledge of which goes to the very core of our charge as authorities in workplace behavior. In some manner, we will likely be expected to have expertise in understanding the overlap of societal and organizational concerns. It Should Be Innovative Some might argue that with respect to the traditional ways by which we have researched organizational behavior, the corporate con sciousness idea is too innovative. Again, however, it must be understood that, although paradigm-breaking, it is simply a means of classifying that which already exists. It is, fundamentally, a label, but it is an inno vative way to label organizational action, and through its somewhat in terdisciplinary nature, it has become an innovative way of merging psy chological literature. It will hopefully stimulate the exploration of even more theoretical frontiers. As today's organizations are experiencing rapid evolution, the evolution of organizational research should not fall far behind. HOW TO STUDY "CORPORATE CONSCIOUSNESS" Another of Campion and Palmer's (1996) issues related to corporate consciousness concerned the question of how to study it. First to be ad dressed, however, is whether corporate consciousness can be studied as a construct. It must be again restated that, rather than thinking of corporate consciousness as a construct to be measured or treated as an organiza tional variable, it must be viewed as a paradigm, an ideology to guide research and practice in organizations. Like other concepts such as "cor porate culture," corporate consciousness plays an important role in orga nizational existence, yet it may be too abstract to adequately measure. Further, corporate consciousness may be better suited to serve as a framework for understanding constructs that are more easily measured. Its potential use as a framework, however, in no way minimizes its im portance. Though we do not advocate the use of corporate consciousness as a construct, it is still interesting to investigate the possibility of studying (i.e. operationalizing) it in the future. Certainly, Schein (1985) and other</page><page sequence="11">KEITH A. LAVINE AND ELNA S. MOORE 411 scholars have attempted to operationalize the construct of corporate cul ture, often comparing different organizations in terms of effectiveness. In fact, methods do exist for measuring organizational culture. In a sim ilar vein, it may be possible to compare corporations in terms of their levels of consciousness (i.e. awareness). For now, though, it seems that there are two key ways to go about studying corporate consciousness: 1) Study sub-topics such as globalization, environmentalism and systems thinking, or 2) Borrow "consciousness" research from other areas of psy chology to study individual consciousness as both an independent and a dependent variable. Other potential methods may be just as suitable. CONCLUSION There is a tendency to look at many new organizational practices (e.g. diversity management, 360-degree feedback, globalization, etc.) as separate entities. For this and other reasons, there is not always a clear theoretical rationale for the implementation of these practices in organi zations. For example, often organizations pay mere lip service to diver sity management because the only clear rationale for its practice is orga nizational politics (Cox &amp; Blake, 1991). Corporate consciousness is a theoretical framework that pulls many diverse practices together and provides a stronger rationale for their usage. The concept of corporate consciousness has important practical im plications. First of all, it provides a stronger theoretical foundation for the organizational practitioner to justify the implementation of different policies and practices in an organization. For example, from a corporate consciousness perspective, diversity management is important for at least two reasons: 1) It promotes an organization's attention to the ex ternal environment where reality dictates that organizations must deal with the issue of diversity in order to remain competitive; 2) Making employees more aware of their differences, as well as their biases, should hopefully foster a more cooperative climate of teamwork. Secondly, the practitioner can use different tools to increase corpo rate consciousness. Many of these tools are already used in some organi zations. Employee opinion surveys, 360-degree feedback, and the Orga nizational Self-Reflection Model (Finney &amp; Mitroff, 1986) are examples of tools that may be useful in increasing self-awareness at a micro and/ or macro level. Globalization seminars, diversity management, and ex ternal customer satisfaction surveys are examples of tools that may en hance an organization's understanding of the external environment. Job rotation, cross-functional work teams, and improved communications are examples of tools that may increase the awareness of the interde pendency of an organization's subsystems. Finally, all of the tools men</page><page sequence="12">412 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY tioned above, as well as increased employee involvement at all levels, should make an organization, overall, more mindful in the processing of information. Certainly, there are other policies and practices currently in use in organizations that may contribute to the consciousness of a corporation. No doubt there are many new tools that could be developed for this purpose. It is hoped that future research will be devoted to developing new tools and measuring the effectiveness of many of these practices. It may be worthwhile for future theoreticians to further refine the frame work of corporate consciousness to increase its usefulness for organiza tions. Perhaps, just as organizations in the past have asked themselves "How do we become a Tbtal Quality organization?" or "How do we be come leaner and meaner?," organizations in the near future will ask themselves "How do we become a conscious corporation?"
