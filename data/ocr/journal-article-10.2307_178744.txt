<plain_text><page sequence="1">Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists IVAN STRENSKI Connecticut College This is by no means the first attempt to link Levi-Strauss with Buddhist thought. It is my purpose to make it, however, the most thorough and least eccentric comparison to date. I want to set the record straight about the nature and significance of Buddhist parallels in the thought of Claude Levi-Strauss. To my mind there are both theoretical and historical values in revealing the extent to which it might be said that a common 'mind' may be seen at work in these two apparently different historical realities. On the level of theory, this comparison constitutes, in some small and preliminary way, an informal 'structuralism of structuralism.' I seek to lend further credence to the structuralist view that different schemes of thought and action may be seen as variants on a single theme, or aspects of a common code. The perception of such underlying unities in human affairs suggests one reason why certain cultural phenomena in recent times have had the kinds of disquieting effects of Buddhism and structuralism. They perhaps touch the same tender nerves of contemporary consciousness, and I Throughout this essay I shall use Theravada Buddhism as my standard representative of the Buddhist tradition. This branch of Buddhism is found today in most parts of South and Southeastern Asia. It contrasts with the Mahayana tradition of East Asia in doctrine, social organization, ritual, among other things. The chief reasons I have chosen this form of Buddhism for comparison with structuralist thought are three: (1) the ideas of Theravada Buddhism seem more closely related to Levi-Strauss's ideas than those of other forms of Buddhism; (2) only one documented account of Levi-Strauss's encounter with a Buddhist society exists, a meeting that took place in the early 1950s in Theravadin Burma; and (3) because Theravada Buddhism is in many ways logically and historically the most 'primitive' form of Buddhism we know, it serves ably the purpose of comparison. On the one hand, simplicity makes the conceptual task of comparing systems of thought, complex even under normal circumstances, all the easier. On the other hand, since in some way the classic ideas of all Buddhist traditions can be seen to develop from seminal ideas and oppositions in Theravada Buddhism as revealed in the Pali Canon, a comparison that begins with Theravada Buddhism has at least a good chance of representing the broad traditions of Buddhism. This is not however necessarily to echo the beliefs of modern Theravada orthodoxy: some forms of Mahayana Buddhism are just as, or even more, 'primitive' than forms of Theravadin belief and practice. I want only to agree with those who have made the case for the extraordinary antiquity and primitiveness of much of the Pali Canon and current Theravadin belief and practice. 0010-4175/80/1109-0100 ? 1980 Society for Comparative Study of Society and History 3</page><page sequence="2">4 IVAN STRENSKI do so in analogous ways. They transform similar proposals about human nature which both attract interest and yet repel it at the same time. If this analysis has not absolutely mined the depths of these things I will at least be glad to have stripped back some layers of the surface, and to have begun tracing some of the deep running veins enriching both Buddhism and structuralism. Without being too greatly distracted by their different 'codes,' the human sciences ought to try to understand the great ideological options entertained by human beings. Buddhism and structuralism present aspects of one of these great options. On the level of historical inquiry, I also seek to encourage students of the affairs of this century to take rather more seriously the depth and nature of what one knows as 'orientalism.' Levi-Strauss represents only one example of a leading intellectual whose thought may meaningfully be said to move in Buddhist directions. In particular, it would be interesting to consider the affinity of Levi-Strauss for Buddhism as an aspect of his location among assimilated Jewish intellectuals on the left-wing of the political spectrum of the Third Republic. Why did Levi-Strauss express his pacific tendencies in Buddhist terms? Was he alone in doing so? What of the 'orientalism' and left-wing politics of someone like Marcel Mauss? What do we know about Sylvain-Levy, the great buddhologist, in this connection? It does not seem to me that the story of the left wing in the Third Republic has been told from this standpoint. With these horizons in view, let me begin this comparison with a brief survey of some of the most prominent attempts to deal roundly and seriously with Levi-Strauss's affinity for Buddhism. Given the complexity and subtlety of both Buddhism and structuralism, it will be no surprise that balance and accuracy do not characterize these studies. In the end, each attempt to find the center of this comparison tends to slide off center, and veer out into space. I. SOME ECCENTRICS Even though Levi-Strauss devotes the concluding chapters of his autobio- graphy (to 1955), Tristes Tropiques, to an appreciation of Buddhism, the relation of these discussions to Buddhism have not been rigorously explored. This is all the more remarkable in light of recent criticism of structuralism by present-day French Marxists as ahistorical and con- templative. Still the theme lies virtually untouched. When it has been treated in print, it has been regarded only curiously or eccentrically. Robert F. Murphy's 'On Zen Marxism'2 is fairly typical. Having baited his hook as if to lure the great denizens of the deep, Murphy disappoints readers credulous enough to believe that titles of articles have anything to 2 R. F. Murphy, 'On Zen Marxism,' Man, 63, 1963.</page><page sequence="3">LEVI-STRAUSS AND THE BUDDHISTS 5 do with their contents. Murphy says virtually nothing about Zen, nor about Buddhism, and therefore nothing about the relation of Buddhism to structuralism. More responsible to his readers is the intellectual historian H. Stuart Hughes. In his otherwise severely flawed treatment of Levi-Strauss in The Obstructed Path,3 Hughes notes that Levi-Strauss believes Buddhism 'com- pletes' the material liberation begun by Marxism. This is a theme of considerable importance for understanding both Levi-Strauss and the Buddhist-Marxist syncretists of then contemporary (early 1950s) South Asia. And in this sense, Hughes has at least got his hands on a comparison with concrete historic import for both the biography of Levi-Strauss and the political life-story of modern Buddhism. The same cannot be said, unhappily, for Hughes's pseudo-theosophical misreading of Buddhism as perennially embodying 'a tone of acceptance of cosmic resignation'4-- even if this grasps the mood of Weltschmerz and decline often encountered in the meditative musings of Levi-Strauss or the image projected by the 'salon Buddhism' of the 1920s and later.5 As we will see shortly, Levi-Strauss's understanding and appropriation of Buddhism fall far short of thorough- ness. So he moves toward two opposing poles in the Buddhist tradition at the same time, perhaps without realizing this. Even if Hughes has not got these two poles in perfect focus, he has at least represented two orientations in the thought of Levi-Strauss which also are really Buddhist in certain senses: Levi-Strauss is at once thrilled by the prospect of the union of revolutionary ideology with contemplative praxis, on the one side, yet he also broods that Promethean and humanist visions are folly: 'The world began without the human race and it will probably end without it.'6 Although elements of pessimism are to be found in the Buddhist tradi- tion and structuralism, others like Susan Sontag and Robert Zimmerman,7 respectively, trace Levi-Strauss's pessimism, equanimity, and detachment to the influence of Lucretius. This at least has the dubious benefit of continuity with the intellectual tradition of the West. Levi-Strauss does indeed credit the philosopher of nature with a footnote in The Raw and the Cooked and a one-line epigram from De Rerum Natura in the opening 3 H. S. Hughes, The Obstructed Path (New york: Harper and Row, 1968), reprinted in E. Hayes and T. Hayes, eds. Claude Levi-Strauss: The Anthropologist as Hero (Cambridge: The MIT Press 1970), pp. 22-46. 4 Ibid., p. 45. 5 I have coined the term 'salon Buddhism' to describe a certain cultural vogue for Buddhist notions and practices among Western intellectual elites in the early decades of the 20th century. As far as I know, little work has been done on this phenomenon, although such studies might easily be as rewarding and informative as studies we now possess on the rage for oriental ideas and practices in the last two decades. 6 C.

By contrast, the citations of Buddhist notions as well as the grasp of Buddhist concepts rate serious attention, as we will see. Moreover, virtually any part of Levi-Strauss's 'Lucretian' pessimism, detachment, and introversion can be found in the Buddhist tradition as well. Despite the advantage Lucretius receives by virtue of his membership in the Western cultural tribe, the far-flung Bud- dhists actually seem to exert more influence on Levi-Strauss than their like-minded European counterparts-at least if we go by the evidence available in the written record Levi-Strauss provides us. To be sure, the influence of Buddhism on the thought of Levi-Strauss in no way matches that of Durkheim, Boas, Marx, Freud and others within the recent history of the human sciences in the West. The same cannot be said for the rather pale effect of the thought of Lucretius. By contrast, the imprint of Buddhist ideas, while not standing out in bold red, at least shows its modest saffron hue. Doubtless the most interesting and fruitful discussion of this subject comes from the polymathic pen of the Mexican man of letters, Octavio Paz. In a dashing tour through this territory of cross-cultural intellectual scenes, Paz provides sure, clear and steady direction: The 'similarity between Buddhism and Levi-Strauss's thought is not accidental,'9 says Paz pointing over the horizon. Along with Stuart Hughes, Sontag and Zimmerman, Paz notes the moods of sobriety, detachment,'0 and revulsion for power shared by the Buddhists and Levi-Strauss. 1 Paz then moves on to note how both structuralism and (at least) early Buddhism share relational ontologies'2- even if Levi-Strauss's focus tends toward logical matters, while the early Buddhists conceive these fundamental relations casually and materially. Buddhism and structuralism also reject certain fundamental metaphysical positions. Both dismiss the idea of a transcendental human ego,"3 since both reject substantialist ontologies. Both dismiss the idea of an ultimate meaning in history, since both reject the existence of some cosmic person or force which could give history such meaning.'4 Both finally suspect the pretentions of human ideologies, since mental constructs are no more permanent and substantial than any other, whether personal, material or otherwise. 15 Even though Paz may represent the best of those who have taken up this problem of the relation of Buddhism to structuralism, a better treatment is possible. Paz treats the relationship rather haphazardly and casually. There 8 Sontag, ibid., pp. 187ff., Zimmerman, ibid., pp. 232ff. 9 0.

What is more, there are rather serious differences between Levi-Strauss's view of the world and the Bud- dhist dhamma. Paz skates rather lightly over these and thus presents too agreeable a picture of the actual relationships between structuralist and Buddhist thought. Before presenting my own view of the positive correla- tions, let me state some significant distinguishing differences. II. SOME DIFFERENCES These distinguishing features divide into those of form and content, re- spectively. In form, Buddhism always appears as a 'religion;' structuralism does not. This is so despite what Susan Sontag says in describing the structural anthropologist as a saint-like figure 'engaged in saving his soul' 16. The principal danger here lies in the seductive power of the extravagant use of metaphor: Structuralism indeed invites us to accept a worldview, a Weltanschauung, a total anthropology, and thus to take on the global visionary ambitions of 'religions.' But if that is all that most 'religions' are, then they would have been long since reduced to what Thomas Luckmann calls 'invisible religions.'17 Religions in the plenary sense have been much more than what Luckmann describes-matters of private attitude, 'in the head,' so to speak. They have been considerably richer human phenomena than the rather thin 'religion' that structuralism is supposed to be. On top of this, even if structuralism were such an 'invisible religion,' it would be, in the opinion of historians of religion like Robert Ellwood, a 'folk religion'- and one on the brink of extinction'8-lacking the vital social and institu- tional embodiment necessary for persistence through time. In content, Buddhism and structuralism also seem to speak in different voices: Where Buddhists hold sharp views about matters of morality, Levi-Strauss seems-at least half the time-to waffle on specific matters of right and wrong. One calls to mind, for example, Levi-Strauss's cultural relativity with respect to the morality of cannibalism, as an instance of his principled unwillingness to engage the moral issues.19 Now even if it is also true (as I will argue later) that Levi-Strauss speaks as a Buddhist moralist on other issues, this does little more than present a certain paradox. In general the differences between ethical absolutism and ethical relativism remain. Besides there are other substantial points of disagreement, which can be 16 Sontag, 'The Anthropologist as Hero,' p. 191. 17 T. Luckmann, Invisible Religion (New York: Macmillan and Co., 1967). 18 R.

(2) Although I will argue that between structuralist and Buddhist psychologies much is shared in common, at least one major difference in mode ought to be noted: like those of Freud, Buddhist psychological perspectives are dynamic. Causality remains the key operative principle.21 By contrast, structuralism adopts static and gestaltic perspectives.22 (3) Epistemologi- cally, early Buddhism at least is empiricist and even positivist:23 structural- ism deliberately sets out to displace both empiricist and positivist episte- mologies in the human sciences.24 Although it is true that other forms of Buddhism are as anti-empiricist as structuralism, it is not primarily in epistemology that Buddhism and structuralism compare. It is rather in terms of general worldview that Buddhism and Levi-Strauss share similar presuppositions. It is this 'general' sense of Buddhism which cuts across sectarian lines, and makes for fruitful comparison with structuralism. III. A MEETING OF MINDS Although it may not be essential to the argument I seek to establish, it would be circumstantially useful to make historically plausible the connec- tion of Levi-Strauss's structuralism to Buddhist ideas. What do we know about what Levi-Strauss knew or might plausibly have known about Buddhism? We know for a start that Levi-Strauss did some fieldwork in Burma among Buddhists of the Chittagong area during the 1950s.25 It is notable that in the context of this episode of his life Levi-Strauss admits a pious concern for Buddhism. A key passage in his discussion of Buddhism in the concluding chapters of his autobiography, Tristes Tropiques, tells us much about the man we have seen only from the perspective of anthropological theory, Freudianism, Marxism, and other Western ideologies. While he is accompanying a pious Burmese friend to a rural Buddhist temple, a potentially awkward incident occurs: 'You need not do as I do,' said my companion as he prostrated himself four times before the altar: and I, respecting his opinion, remained motionless ... And yet, for once, I should have felt no embarrassment had I followed his example. Between that form of worship and myself there was no misunderstanding to get in the way. It was 20 C.

To those reflections my civilization could only contribute by confirming them.... For what, after all, have I learnt from the masters I have listened to, the philosophers I have read, the societies I have investigated, and that very Science in which the West takes such pride? Simply a fragmentary lesson or two which, if laid end to end, could reconstitute the meditations of the Sage at the foot of his tree.26 Whatever else one might say about this passage, it certainly establishes the point that Levi-Strauss was no stranger to Buddhism. But the origin of Levi-Strauss's knowledge of Buddhism seems out of the reach of most scholars, at least for the moment. Levi-Strauss has denied explicitly any knowledge of Buddhism.27 And we know virtually nothing about the extent and character of the popular intellectual awareness of Buddhism in Levi- Strauss's time-especially the period of the 1920s when he would have come into contact with these and other diverse intellectual influences as a student of philosophy in Paris. I prefer to call this type of Buddhism 'salon Buddhism.' Evidence of a common understanding of a vague sort of Buddhism is evident in German intellectual and popular circles of the time in question. And if this be true of Germany, why not of France? Here one thinks of Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann, Karl Jaspers, Oswald Spengler among others. Surely there are French parallels, those thinkers who might have popularized Buddhist notions among the French intelligentsia during the formative period of Levi-Strauss's intellectual life in the 1920s. At any rate, scholars might want to look here for evidence of such sources of Buddhist ideas in Levi-Strauss. Historians of thought might also follow the internal line of influence which may be traced from Levi-Strauss to Freud, and thence to Schopen- hauer,28 perhaps the first European to popularize and develop Buddhist ideas in a thoroughgoing and systematic way. Here one could trace the well-worn path from Levi-Strauss's notion of the unconscious to that of Freud's. In turn one would then have to travel the lesser known route from Freud back to Schopenhauer. Historians of philosophy have generally concurred that in Schopenhauer's general notion of unconscious mental activity the roots of Freud's equally general views about the unconscious are to be found. This connection also explains the somewhat brooding and pessimistic assessment of human rationality and consciousness that these three thinkers share and expound in their different ways. But regarding both of these historical accounts of Levi-Strauss's interest and knowledge of Buddhism I remain unenthusiastic. The line from Freud to Schopenhauer, however historically respectable, seems rather too weak 26 Ibid., p. 394. 27 Personal correspondence. 28 De Silva, Buddhist and Freudian Psychology, Appendix, pp. 171-87.</page><page sequence="8">10 IVAN STRENSKI and thin to support so much weighty and detailed speculation as revealed in the citation above. And lacking the basic research on the 'salon Buddhism' of the 1920s we are not in a very good position to locate the sources of Levi-Strauss's knowledge of Buddhism there either. At any rate, Levi- Strauss knows a bit too much (despite the denials) about Buddhism and knows this a bit too well to attribute his feeling for Buddhism to an orientalisme of intellectual fashion. To support this, consider only the things Levi-Strauss has to say about Buddhism and Marxism, again in the specific context of his field study in Burma: Buddhism has achieved something that, elsewhere, only Marxism has brought off: it has reconciled metaphysics with the problem of human behavior ... Between Marxist criticism, which sets man free from his first chains, and Buddhist criticism, which completes that liberation, there is neither opposition nor contradiction . . . Marxism and Buddhism are doing the same things, but at different levels.29 As it happens, Levi-Strauss seems to echo the words of a vocal group of South Asian Buddhist intellectuals-perhaps even without realizing it. Numbering among them many prominent Burmese, this group advocated in the early 1950s a form of political alliance, at least at the ideological level, between Buddhism and Marxism.30 I suggest that this did not escape Levi-Strauss's attention during or in preparation for his field study of Burmese Buddhism in the early 1950s. (This, I want to suggest, had a double impact on Levi-Strauss, as we will see shortly). Here, for instance, are the words of such a Buddhist-Marxist syncretist from Burma: 'In the beginning I was a Buddhist only by tradition. The more I study Marxism, however, the more I feel convinced in Buddhism ... for any man who has deeply studied Buddhism, and correctly perceived its tenets there should be no obtacle to becoming a Marxist ... Marxist theory deals with mundane affairs and seeks to satisfy material needs in life ... Buddhist philosophy, however, deals with the solution of spiritual satisfaction in life and liberation from this mundane world.'31 To most readers, these two texts would seem to be saying quite similar things. In fact Levi-Strauss may well have been paraphrasing the words of the Buddho-Marxist syncretist quoted above, so closely do they resemble one another. One need not however go this far. It matters little whether Levi-Strauss knew about Buddhist-Marxist syncretism before he went to Burma, after he returned from Burma, or indeed whether or not he ever realized what the Burmese thought about the relations of Marxism and Buddhism. What 29 Levi-Strauss, Tristes Tropiques, p. 395. 30 E. Sarkisanz, Buddhist Backgrounds of the Burmese Revolution (The Hague: Mouton, 1965). 31 U Ba Swe, The Burmese Revolution, quoted in G.O. Totten, 'Buddhism and Socialism in Japan and Burma,' Comparative Studies in Society and History, 2, 1960:301.</page><page sequence="9">LEVI-STRAUSS AND THE BUDDHISTS II matters is Levi-Strauss's view about this relation. I want at least to be consistent about my judgement that historical data is so poor in this case that it is relatively useless to stake one's claims about the relation of Buddhism and structuralism to any historical foundation at all. We simply do not know enough about the actual historical connections between Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists to say very much. Thus if there are connec- tions between structuralism and Buddhism, they are not likely to be historical, but structural themselves! If history does not seem able here to suggest why Levi-Strauss sometimes thinks like a Buddhist, then perhaps structuralism can? What we seem to have in the case of Levi-Strauss's appreciation of Buddhism and his own creation of structuralism, I want to argue, is something of the same 'mind' being worked out. Without reifying the notion of 'mind,' I believe it can be shown that Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists think about certain things in the same way because structural anthropology, broadly understood, and Buddhist 'anthropology' share a common 'mind' on certain key issues in human nature. The significance of Levi-Strauss's Burmese experience then should be clear: Imagine his astonishment: not only does he find his own modified Marxism alive and well in Buddhist Burma; he also discovers that many militant Burmese reconcile this with Buddhist piety and principles. Could Levi-Strauss have failed to make the further inference? To wit, if Buddhists perceive deep relations between their own thought and Marxism, how can structuralism, which has always acknowledged its Marxist inheritance (however little deserved) resist the connection with Buddhism? In Buddhist thought and practice Levi-Strauss seems to recognize deep similarities with the movement of his own thought. I want now to spell out these similarities and show how structuralism and Buddhism are led to many of the same problems and solutions to questions about human nature. Thus, Levi- Strauss's attraction to Buddhism does more than exemplify the grand bricoleur at play; it signals a deeper affinity on the one hand between Buddhist thought, seen in a new light through its syncretism with Marxism, and on the other hand, with structuralism, which has always paid homage to Marx. IV. LEVI-STRAUSS AND THE BUDDHISTS ON THE NATURE OF SOCIETY Sociological Individualism. The meeting of structuralism and Buddhism in a common 'mind' bears close inspection simply because they agree on the fundamental issues of human nature: the nature of society and human psychology. Let us take the nature of human society first. Early Buddhist social theory has been credited with the belief in a 'contract theory of society.'32 Buddhists have always held such a posi- 32 R. S. Sharma, Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in Ancient India. Delhi: pp. 65ff.</page><page sequence="10">12 IVAN STRENSKI tion-at least in India-in order to distinguish themselves from the Hindu tradition, which teaches the divine origins of traditional caste society. Individual men agree to make society, not the gods. Yet, Buddhists have also exhibited a keen awareness of the deeper limits and incorrigible defects of social life, however it may be arranged. Society is a worldly institution, unalterably marked and conditioned by dukkha (ill-fare), anicca (imper- manence) and anattd (non-substantiality). This tendency of the Buddhists to mistrust the ability of men to tran- scend the radical limits of their social arrangements seems to give Buddhist social theory a dogmatic conservative appearance. This in part is so. Historically speaking, the Buddhists were opposed to the new society which was then in the making in the fifth century Ganges Valley. But, there is every reason to deplore the political and social distress this new society was trying to impose upon the masses of people. A. K. Warder33 and others have argued that Buddhist conservatism functioned as a protest against exploitative changes under way in the time of Buddha. The 'otherworldly' character of Buddhist social teaching then needs to be understood relative to the kind of 'world' that was in the making at the time of the Buddha. The Buddhists were, in effect, saying that despite the social contracts worked out by this new exploitative society, certain incorrigible limits would be reached against which no maneuvers would be effective. Even the tyrant was limited by the deep conditions which governed all social arrangements. In the Buddhist case, the teachings of ill-fare, impermanence, and non-sub- stantiality warned the tyrant not to expect things to go as he may have wished. The deep nature of human social life was change, and change afflicts tyranny as much as it afflicts any other social scheme. One would not be mistaken if one read behind the lines of the dual Buddhist attitude to society a particular attitude to the individual. Although society in some sense can be treated in the Buddhist view as a. 'thing,' the Buddhists see society primarily as an aggregate of individuals. Dukkha, etc., afflict the social contract, because these limiting conditions fundamentally afflict the individual. Conversely, if one would reform society, one must begin by fundamentally reforming the individual. This sociological individualism in no small part accounts for the tradi- tional Buddhist reliance upon the 'Great Man' to bring about necessary social change and/or stability. The central place played by the Buddhist monarch, like Asoka in ancient times, and the modern political leaders of newly independent nations of Buddhist South Asia, like Thailand, is thus no historical accident. Buddhist social theory requires the 'Great Man' as much as it requires 'social contract.' Both are particular to sociological individualism. And even though the individual may, in the end, be afflicted 33 A. K. Warder, 'Early Buddhism and other Contemporary Systems,' Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 18, 1956:43-63.</page><page sequence="11">LEVI-STRAUSS AND THE BUDDHISTS 13 by dukkha, anicca, and anattd, there is no society without him or prior to him. Even though the Buddhists refused to reify the individual or honor him with the title 'substance,' it would have been far worse in Buddhist eyes to have reified or imbued with substance the social order-as traditional Hindus and newly emergent fifth century statists were wont to do. With the rise of modern states in the Buddhist world the traditional social teachings come under some stress. Both Marxist and non-Marxist states seeking to promote rapid economic development seem inevitably to put emphasis on the need to fullfil national goals, rather than purely individual ones. Moreover, even in the traditional perspective, social wel- fare and reform have had strong mandates ever since the days of Asoka at least. The common cry is that the good society inevitably encourages goodness, and thus saintliness, in the individual. The Sangha (the Buddhist order of monks), too, is the normal context of holiness, not' something added on to the individual quest for salvation. Thus, on balance, one cannot write off Buddhism as a simple-minded sort of individualistic religion. Much of the tradition is and continues to be social. This does not, however, contradict what I have said about the key ontological place of the individual in social theory. That remains. Social Life with a Hidden Face. In all this the Buddhists tried to co-opt and transcend the positivist spirit that prevailed in their day. Jayatilleke, for instance,34 notes how the Buddhists both assent to the positivist view that all knowledge must rest on sense experience, while extending the foundations of knowledge to include extra-sensory perception. ESP in the Buddhist view merely represents an extension of sensory knowledge, rather than its denial. Therefore, no great problem arose for them in this novel epistemological view. In fact, the Buddhists went on to use ESP in a perfectly positivist way to verify the central tenets of Buddhism (dukkha, anicca,...). In particular social and historical situations, this enabled Buddhists to 'see through' the events of the present moment, so to speak: Despite the apparent permanence of the new autocratic states thriving in the day of the Buddha, one could see within them the seeds of their destruction-all these states, like all individuals, were marked by the conditions of existence, dukkha, anicca,.... The nature of social life was not written on its face; that deep truth is found by transcending the limits of ordinary sense experience, by developing the proper sort of ability to 'see' beyond the flat world of everyday life. Such an attitude may also be expressed in another way: the Buddhists believed that perception, knowledge, truth, etc., could be looked on as occurring on different levels.35 Roughly, for the Buddhists these were the conventional (sammuti) and absolute (paramattha) levels. They, in turn, 34 K. N. Jayatilleke, Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, pp. 358ff. 35 Ibid., pp. 351-68.</page><page sequence="12">14 IVAN STRENSKI mirrored the dual levels of social life that we saw earlier, not to mention a broad range of key divisions within other areas of life. In fact, one might note in concluding this discussion how dualities afflicted and in fact charac- terized Buddhist attitudes to life as a whole: At once champions of the welfare state, yet all the while nagged by the ineradicable defects inherent in the human situation; at once determined to remake society along the lines of Buddhist ethical principles, yet all the while just as convinced of the preferability of leaving the world behind; at once accepting the good society as conducive to salvation, yet refusing to identify the good society with salvation. Some commentators, like Bardwell Smith, even go on to add that these apparent conflicts ought to remain part of Buddhist life, and that For Buddhists to lose this distinction is to transform their tradition into something discontinuous with its original and historic essence .... The central task of Budd- hism in the immediate future is to display the reconcilability of what often seem divergent paths.36 In his own way, Levi-Strauss offers many of the same views about the nature of society., As an avowed critic of positivism37 in the social sciences Levi-Strauss holds that although in the empirical point of view society may appear a product of convention, it is really a natural phenomenon. Social contracts are themselves governed by the unconscious and inherent struc- ture of the human brain.38 Like the Buddhists, then, Levi-Strauss is conser- vative about society's ability to transform itself by further contracts and conventions. Society can change significantly only if nature itself changes. Even for a sophisticated materialist like Levi-Strauss, basic social change would then require basic change in the structure of matter. This would most evidently be reflected in the make up of the brain, then in the 'psyche,' and finally in society. Notice finally how these moves leave Levi-Strauss, like the Buddhists, in the end a sociological individualist. We get to 'rock bottom' in society when we get down to the brain. There will, of course, be differences of nuance between the positions we have canvassed. The Buddha would probably be somewhat more ambiva- lent about whether or not changes in the structure of matter would ser- iously affect the way men think. The question of whether psychological traits reduce to or are determined by material characteristics of the human brain is hard to determine in the case of Buddhist psychology. In any event human transformation (the Buddhist Nirvana) is something Buddhists have always linked with human effort.

The Buddhists seem to play rather faster and looser with the idea of neurological constraints upon knowledge than do the structuralists. The Buddhists believe that although one might not be able to change the structures of the social world in fundamental ways, through his own moral effort, the Buddhist saint can change the cognitive and psychological structures of his own 'mind' (not necessarily identified with 'brain'). For Levi-Strauss this sort of 'direct action' on behalf of changing our own mental-neurological structure hardly seems possible. Yet, of course, both the Buddhists and Levi-Strauss still agree that the deep nature of human society remains impervious to human manipulation: There are no utopias possible for the Buddhists or Levi-Strauss. Residual Sociological Holism? Now it is true that this shared suspicion about the ability of human will and deed to transform our social arrange- ments rests primarily on a view of the individual which Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists hold. (We will see more about this in the next section.) Yet it is also true that Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists sometimes talk as if the social realm had its own laws and traits, and as if one could perhaps speak about problems particular to the social realm as such. How they are able to do so without contradicting the methodological and sociological indivi- dualism of their views of social being I am not prepared to say. It is not important, at any rate, to settle this matter here. What is important is to note that both the Buddhists and Levi-Strauss talk this way and to appre- ciate the things they have to say. For Levi-Strauss, societies seem to rest on contradictions, on kinds of typically tragic inconsistencies in their principles of organization. We discover these inconsistencies in myths. The structures revealed in myths from the far reaches of the globe show that societies nurture deep irrecon- cilable desires within their own constitutions. These contradictions are so fundamental to the existence of the societies, however, that to eliminate them would be impossible without at the same time destroying them. Again Levi-Strauss heaves a deep sigh and like a fatherly psychoanalyst broods on: 'No society is perfect. Each has within itself, by nature, an impurity incompatible with the norms to which it lays claim.... 39 No society chooses this situation. Moreover, one can do little more than try to palliate the conflict by the use of myths, rituals, and religion. Short of destroying the society thus afflicted, one cannot extract or replace these contradictions. As Levi-Strauss tries to argue, notably in his analyses of Oedipus or Asdiwal, for instance, it is in the nature of social reality that the participants in society are constrained to want things they cannot possibly 39 Levi-Strauss, Tristes Tropiques, p. 385.</page><page sequence="14">i6 IVAN STRENSKI have and to do things they cannot possibly achieve.40 Poignant evidence of this from myths from across the globe testify that those who do not observe this natural law meet the pathetic ends that Oedipus, Asdiwal, or other mythical heroes have met: knowledge that leads to blindness, or mobility that ends in stasis. Little imagination is required to cast Levi-Strauss's vision in a Buddhist light. The correspondence is remarkable, even to the way both the Bud- dhists and Levi-Strauss focus on the key problem of desires, wants, and ambitions. Yet, the differences are noteworthy: For Levi-Strauss the brain and its material structure explain finally why the mythical heroes are constrained to do this or that. The Buddha, on the other hand, accounts for the pervasiveness of the conflict and the futility of desire on the psychological level alone. Buddhists do not feel required to explain the logic of conflicted desire in terms of neurological levels of human life. Reductionism does not seduce the Buddhists (at least not until now) the way it has attracted Levi-Strauss. The Buddha was addressing problems he took to be funda- mentally psychological and moral. In response to the world, the Buddha at least tactically counseled with- drawal and finally anchoritic isolation. The Buddha did not of course hate people; nor did he hide from or cower before his enemies. Neither did he naively believe that mere geographical distance from society, whether that society were hospitable or not, would insure salvation. Yet, some degree of remove from the hub-bub of social life seemed necessary for effective psychological detachment. How striking in this regard are the words of Levi-Strauss declaring a seemingly Buddhist-like appetite for solitude and longing for privacy: 'I am by temperament somewhat of a misanthrope. . . because there is nothing I dread more than a too-close relation with my fellow man.'4' Earlier in his life Levi-Strauss would describe something of the same orientation in his description of recruits to different faculties in the university. There are 'extroverts' and 'introverts,' he notes. The first group consists in those attracted to law and medicine, the second to the humanities and sciences. In this dichotomy anthropology finds itself on the side of the introverts: 'Those who read letters of the sciences are characterized by resistance to the demands of the group. Like members of some monastic order they tend to turn more and more in upon themselves....'42 One could hardly want a more explicit statement of the kinship between the kind of work Levi- 40 C.

I want now to consider further support for my attempts to establish a pattern of similarities between the thought of Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists by turning to the matter of human psychology. LEVI-STRAUSS AND THE BUDDHISTS ON PSYCHOLOGY No Self. Perhaps the key correspondence in the psychological views of Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists is their rejection of the transcendental ego. On the whole, both adopt a certain anti-anthropocentric attitude. Human individuality does not stand up to deeper scientific scrutiny. To Levi- Strauss, this means that the 'human sciences' will paradoxically seek to 'dissolve man.'43 The trends of scientific explanation toward monism leave special explanations of human behaviour far in the humanistic past. Man can be quite adequately understood without residue by the very same laws used to explain the world of nature. Indeed, for Levi-Strauss man is a part of nature and structural anthropology a budding natural science.44 Although commonsense and ordinary experience may indicate that man is unique, the truth of things is to be told in terms of the structure of the human brain and the causal flux of natural change. There is even passion in Levi-Strauss's views about the individual: he calls the 'first-person singular . . . detestable,'45 and looks forward with bodhisattva-like vision to the subordination of the ego's 'claims to the objective will-to-emancipation of that multitude of human beings who are still denied the means of choosing their own destiny.'46 Here it seems that Levi-Strauss adopts a Mahayanist perspective in contrast to the positions he took earlier, which lie more within the Theravadin traditions prevailing in Burma and other parts of South Asia. Both traditions concur, however, and aim to overcome individualism, and really only differ here in the strategies employed to attain this end. The Burmese Buddhists, being Theravadin, seek to undermine individualism as directly as Levi-Strauss does in first rejecting the existence of a transcendental ego. The Mahayana Buddhists seek to upset the same sense of uniqueness of the individual by subordinating individual plans to the welfare of the group. For Mahayanists no one is free unless all are free. In Levi-Strauss's reflections on Buddhism in the depths of the Burmese jungle one hears an unmistak- able Mahayanist echo: 'the salvation of any one individual depends on the salvation of humanity as a whole.'47 43 C.

In Buddhist parlance it goes by the name of the doctrine of anattd, literally the doctrine of no-self. In many ways this ancient teaching con- forms to the anti-substantial and processual view of human personality Levi-Strauss shares with contemporary physiological psychology.48 For the early Buddhists human personality enjoys a mere functional unity, which proper insight reveals as a stream of fundamental constituents (khandhaD impersonally caused by conditions. The Buddhists cast the ontological net a bit wider than does Levi-Strauss, because they also hold that consciousness (vinndna) may be counted as one of these causally conditioned constituents of the human person.49 Moreover, unlike Levi- Strauss, consciousness dominates the more crudely material khandhds and controls their development and combination. Unlike the perhaps more consistently materialist Levi-Strauss, the Buddhists seem to have a greater sense of the ways mind exerts influence over matter, even as mind depends upon matter.50 No Secrets. Since both Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists share similar critical attitudes toward individualism, both also share related convictions which rise from this fundamental belief. Both, for example, feel rather little sensitivity about the privacy of mental processes or about the putative rights of 'privileged access' regarding the 'contents' of mind. Structuralists look forward, for example, to the inevitable reduction of 'mind' to 'brain,' and therefore to empirical scrutiny of the mind. As if to rub in the shortcomings of introspection and privileged access, Levi-Strauss notes the notorious fallibility of introspection and finally its inability to penetrate the deep unconscious levels of mind, from whence, he believes, conscious thought arises. These deep unconscious structural constraints upon our conscious human thought are beyond introspective powers simply because they are (for Levi-Strauss, at any rate) beyond mental power: as 'meaty' neurological entities and only susceptible to empirical analysis of the brain.51 The Buddha was, of course, no neurologist. Yet for him and others of potent mental development, the minds of others are open to a kind of 'empirical' inspection-even to the degree that ordinarily unconscious and unrecognized mental factors are concerned.52 Likewise the minds of the Buddha and the saints (arahant) are open to their own inspection, which on certain occasions is claimed to be infallible.53 This indeed makes the Buddha more the epistemological optimist, since for him introspection too 48 R.

But it must be admitted that the cognitive powers claimed by the Buddhists were rather special, and not therefore really comparable to those Levi-Strauss may have had in dismissing the cognitive pretentions of introspection. Yet, to the extent these broad epistemological views are comparable, the Buddha and Levi-Strauss share common views about the severe limits to claims of 'privileged access,' something one might expect from psychological views which place man in a fundamental continuity with the natural world. Man may be different; but persons are neither so special nor so privileged that they can evade the searching scrutiny of scientist or seer. No Violence. This abhorence of individualism in both the cases of Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists has one rather paradoxical, yet rational, outcome. In fact, the very oddity of the situation that both Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists should make the overthrow of ontological individualism the basis of an ethic of compassion speaks in another way for the legitimacy of our comparison: It is odd, and therefore noteworthy, that both Levi- Strauss and the Buddhists should think oddly in the same way! Every reader of Levi-Strauss has no doubt been impressed by the prevail- ing mood of sympathy, gentleness, and compassion found in his works. But, until this time, no one has argued that such attitudes have roots deep in the soil of structuralism's naturalist and anti-individual conception of human nature, yet, I believe, this is so. For Levi-Strauss, even our sense of individuality rests on a more primitive sense of the unity of our own species with nature, and this has certain consequences: It is because man originally felt himself identical to all those like him (among which, Rousseau explicitly says, we must include animals) that he came to acquire the capacity to distinguish himself as he distinguishes them, i.e. to use the diversity of species as conceptual support for social distinctions.54 In turn this perception of our identity with nature calls mankind to the proper sort of intellectual and ethical attitude. For Levi-Strauss this is nothing less than 'compassion.'55 It is compassion which unifies nature and culture, affectivity and intellectuality. Compassion is that all-embracing attitude which calls all things into an ecological community, into a society of all living things. Such sensitivity has been well documented in the Buddhist tradition. Early Buddhism, in particular, exemplifies how perhaps once uniquely conceived social virtues like kindness and compassion might be extended beyond the frontiers of humankind to embrace all living beings in a single community. To abolish the sharp distinction between man and nature entails that one treat what seemed alien as kin. 54 C. Levi-Strauss, Totemism (Boston: Beacon Press, 1963), p. 101. 55 Ibid.</page><page sequence="18">20 IVAN STRENSKI This however cuts both ways, it must be admitted, and explains in part the unavoidable ambivalence both Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists bring to human and natural affairs. To wit: to treat men and animals alike, let us say, may mean to treat men like pigs, or to treat pigs like men! It seems invariably true that the practical attempts to realize this sort of monist attitude produce a little of both results: Men are treated somewhat worse than they may have been; while animals come out somewhat better. This is especially true, of course, where man has been accustomed to a position of some privilege. But it depends upon the particular nature of the unity constructed. The situation might be otherwise, for example in the Christian notion of the overcoming of the division between man and God. Here, man seems to do rather better than he does in his union with the animals, since he becomes God-like, to put it rather too simply. God, on the other hand, does rather less well, having first to be crucified in the person of Jesus, before his final resurrection and enthronement in glory. In any case, my point remains that ambivalence is unavoidable when one attempts to construct unity where there was once duality. The effort may be still worthwhile, although there are likely to be considerable problems of learning to operate under the new conditions of conceptual merger. In the Buddhist tradition the perils of this sort of conceptual association are numerous. They are also instructive. Despite what I said about the focal importance of compassion, readers of the early Buddhist texts will recall many instances where the Buddha seems compassionate in a most peculiar way. Typically he is unsentimental and even cold in his delivery of kind advice and information. (One could cite the Story of Kisagotami as nar- rated by the Buddhist commentator, Buddhaghosa, for example).56 Yet, if we see this behavior in the light of its relation to the sort of conceptual merger mentioned above, we can understand why the Buddha must be compassionate in the somewhat aloof and remote way that he is. (This is not moreover merely a function of his lofty status as an enlightened being. The behavior of the Buddha is not only unsentimental in manner, but in the nature of the advice he gives). The Buddha's prevailing unsentimental comportment to men indicates that for the Buddha persons were not privileged in the way extreme individualists would believe. Buddhist indivi- dualism shows the signs of its having been moderated by counter-indivi- dualist thinking-in particular, both the rejection of a transcendental egoism and the association of human and non-human life. The other side of the coin shows how this association in the Buddhist tradition also produces particularly 'humane' treatment of animals. One could cite here Buddhist ethical proscriptions against harming animals, as well as the easy way Buddhist literature slips into anthropomorphism and the 'pathetic fallacy.' 56 L. Stryk, World of the Buddha (New York: Doubleday, 1969), pp. 173-74.</page><page sequence="19">LEVI-STRAUSS AND THE BUDDHISTS 21 Readers may be surprised to know that the literature we know as Aesop's Fables originated in the Indian subcontinent, and most probably in the early forms of the Buddhist literature now known as the Jdtakas. For Buddhists, there is no 'fallacy' in attributing human qualities to non- human beings. People are special to some degree, it is true. But the Buddhists would tend to stress the sense of degrees of difference rather than the notion of an unbridgeable gap between men and animals. In the light of these Buddhist beliefs, Levi-Strauss's remarks in a lecture, 'Structuralism and Ecology,' have clear and powerful bearing: In the long run, structuralism teaches us to love and respect the ecology, because it is made up of living things, of plants and animals from which since it began mankind did not only derive its sustenance but also, for a long time, its deepest esthetic feelings as well as its highest moral and intellectual speculations.57 No stray remark. This vision of things fits Levi-Strauss's earlier remarks on totemic distinctions, as well as the antidualist thrust of his overall thinking about human nature. In structural thinking, Buddhism would find the similar desire to undermine the differences which place man in a sovereign position of independence and domination over all fellow beings in the world. No Salvation? Let me pause here to draw together these psychological themes and connect them with the earlier discussion about the nature of society. There we saw that Levi-Strauss and the Buddhists share the view that society is ultimately governed by the same preconventional laws governing nature. Society, just as nature, cannot change beyond the limits inherent in things: no-self, impermanence, ill-fare, etc. Moreover, society is founded upon deep disquieting contradictions. Thus it is both wise and prudent for people to prefer a detached attitude to life. For the Buddhists this culminates, as we all know, in monastic life-at first cenobitic, but ideally anchoritic. The vocation of the hermit also becomes inescapable, because, as we saw, the Buddhists are sociological individualists. In effect this means that the quality of social life depends directly on the quality of individual virtue. People must first strike at their own shortcomings. It is in these personal malignancies that social problems are based. After sensitive persons have removed themselves from society, the job of uprooting the causes of ill must begin in earnest. Levi-Strauss's way of putting this ancient Buddhist viewpoint has a sharper turn to it, no doubt the partial result of his debate with Sartre: Turning Sartre's phrase 'Hell is other people' on its head, Levi-Strauss objects, saying rather, 'Hell is ourselves.'58 And further, 'In a century where man is bent on the destruction of innumerable forms of life' it is 57 Levi-Strauss, 'Structuralism and Ecology,' 14. 58 E. R. Leach, Levi-Strauss (London: Fontana, 1970), p. 37.</page><page sequence="20">22 IVAN STRENSKI necessary to insist, as do the myths, 'that a properly appointed humanism cannot begin of its own accord, but must place the world before life, life before man, and the respect of others before self-interest.'59 While in substantial agreement with Levi-Strauss, a Buddhist would go one step further. Indeed, we may make and be our own 'hells.' Deep constraints structure our thought and behavior in many ways. Yet, some form of serious transformation is possible. Call it what one will, salvation is within the reach of people who care to exert themselves to seek it. For Buddhists this occurs not sentimentally through gracious divine agency, but by rigorous self-effort. Buddhist Nirvdna consists partly in an escape from the limits imposed by individualism, an escape which is described largely in terms of the achievement of knowledge. Levi-Strauss seems often enough the pure rationalist, an heir to the tradition of enlightenment wisdom. But at this writing he has not spelled out the benefits of this knowledge in metaphors of salvation. VI. POSTSCRIPT In sum, a close comparison of Buddhist and structural views of society and self reveal striking parallels, a series of systematically arranged notions. Both bifurcate social nature and dwell on the underlying trans-social, trans-individual deep constraints that fundamentally structure human life. There is no changing these constraints; at best we escape from them. Neither the Buddhists nor Levi-Strauss really accept the possibility of utopian transformations of reality, whether politically or ontologically realized. From the ethical side, both Buddhists and Levi-Strauss show, perhaps to compensate for the incorrigibility of these constraints, the human face of compassion-but based oddly enough on a rejection of ontological individualism. This, in turn, generates in Levi-Strauss a sense of relation with the natural world; in the Buddhists, the rejection of individualism generates an appetite for Nirvdna. 59 Ibid.</page></plain_text>
