<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TRADITION OF THE THRONE VISION IN THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD: Daniel 7:9-10,1 Enoch 14:18-23, and the Book ofGiants (4Q530) The discernment of the complex textual development of the book of Daniel and the sources behind the book has proved to be a very complex task. One such difficulty can be found with the description of the divine throne and deity in Dan. 7:9-10, which is quite comparable to similar passages in 1 Enoch 14 and the Book ofGiantsofGiants (4Q530). Many disagree about the direction of dependency of the depictions of the divine throne in these roughly contemporary documents with some scholars taking a spécifié stance about their literary relationship while others suggest that there is not sufficient evidence to support any conclusion about the direction of dependence. Recently, Ryan E. Stokes has attempted to clarify the literary relation ship between these three documents by proposing that (a) 1 En 14 "depends on a vision account much like that found in Dan 7" and (b) "[t]he Book ofGiants and Daniel, on the other hand, both seem to make use of a common tradition, each adapting it in a différent way." (1) Ultimately, our discussion will focus on the attempts of Stokes and others to identify a literary relationship between Dan. 7:9-10, 1 En 14:18-23, and the throne vision found in the Book ofGiants. It is necessary to discuss both the similarities and différences between the texts in order to discern this relationship. To this end, (1) Ryan Ε.

TROTTER 452 considération must be given mainly to the corrélations of vocabulary, structure, and imagery among the three throne visions which do not seem to come from other sources, such as the previous prophétie throne visions in Ezek. 1 and Isa. 6. Even though it is not necessarily the case that ail of the imagery shared by the throne visions of Ezek. 1, Isa. 6, Dan. 7,1 En 14, and the Book of Giants was gleaned from the earlier prophétie visions, the possibility that these common features are due to the influence of these earlier visions advises against considering this shared imagery or vocabulary as decisive evidence of the relationship between the throne visions of 1 En 14, Dan. 7, and the Book of Giants. Consequently, most similarities between these three throne visions and previous prophétie visions, especially Ezek. 1, 1, will be noted where pertinent, but largely bypassed, in the attempt to discuss the nature of the unique similarities between the visions. Throughout the following analysis, I hope to show that the corre spondences and différences suggest the likelihood that the author of each vision independently made use of a similar developing tradition of interprétation about the characteristics of the divine throne. Dan.Dan. 7:9-10 and 1 En 14:18-23 The visions of the book of Daniel begin in chapter 7, which includes the appearance of the four beasts emerging from the sea. This dream sequence is briefly interrupted by vv. 9-10 describing the visionary,s observation of the divine throne in heaven. These two verses are often regarded as a citation from some older source, (2) which is an important considération for our discussion of the literary relationship of the Danielic throne vision to 1 Enoch and the Book of Giants Giants because ail three throne visions are probably older than their final literary context in these works. This fact will be confirmed throughout our study. The book of Daniel in its near final form is typically dated around 167-164 BCE, (3) and, although there is a com plex textual development for 1 Enoch, the latest portions of the Book ofWatchersofWatchers (1 En 1-36) probably were written by the end of the third century BCE. (4) So then, despite the fact that most scholars now agree that 1 Enoch antedates Daniel and given that the throne vision (2) John J. Collins, Daniel (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993), 299.

A large majority of scholarship acknowledges some relationship between the throne visions in Dan. 7 and 1 En 14. (5) On the one hand, some scholars have argued that 1 En 14 is literarily reliant on the vision in Dan. 7. Ryan Stokes is the most recent proponent of this hypothesis and mainly draws attention to the différences between the visions and their respective theological viewpoints. For example, he does not think it likely that the author of the Danielic vision would have changed the unapproachable glorious divine figure of 1 En 14 into an anthropomorphic white-haired deity. (6) He further argues that some of the différent détails in the vision of 1 En 14 can be explained best as reactions to the theologically difficult descriptions in Dan. 7, such as the deity's presiding at a divine court along with other heav enly figures, which is replaced by the comment in 1 En 14:22 that the deity "needed no counselor; his every word was deed." (7) On the other hand, other scholars have suggested that Dan. 7:9-10 utilizes the throne vision found in 1 En 14:18-23 and thus is an abbreviated adap tation of the text found in 1 En 14. (8) Representing a final position, John Collins acknowledges that the quality of the similarities between (5) For a dissenting opinion, see J. A. Emerton, "The Origin of the Son of Man Imagery," JTS 9 (1958): 225-242. Here Emerton is reacting against the proposai of T. Francis Glasson in The Second Advent: The Origin ofthe New Testament Doctrine (3rd éd.; London: Epworth Press, 1963), 17-23. For a response to Emerton's critiques, see Glasson, "The Son of Man Imagery: Enoch xiv and Daniel vii," NTS 23 (1977): 82-90. Emerton argues that the throne visions in Dan. 7 and 1 En 14 developed independently and that their similarities are only 'accidentai'. He discounts the similarities between the two passages by ascribing them to common biblical sources (Ezek. 1; Deut. 33:2; Ps. 68:17) and says that only by overlooking the différences, such as the anthropomorphic représentation of the deity in Daniel, can one posit literary dependence between the two passages. Instead he thinks that 1 En 14 developed independently with influence from passages such as Gen. 5:24, 2 Kgs. 2:11, and Ezek. 8:3 ("The Origin of the Son of Man Imagery," 229-30). However, these three verses only discuss the ascension of Enoch, Elijah, and Ezekiel to heaven and not what the figure sees or does once that ascension has taken place, and the imagery of Ezek. 1 does not provide precedents for ail of the similarities between Dan. 7:9-10 and 1 En 14:18-23, as will be shown below.

Direct literary influence cannot be ruled out, even if it cannot be decisively proved." (9) He proposes that only the relatedness of the texts can be determined. Before discussing the direction of dependence between the narra tives, first of ail, the relatedness of these two texts must be estab lished. Are there linguistic and structural similarities within both texts that suggest beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a relationship between them? One of the difficulties in answering this question is that there is not a surviving text of 1 En 14 in Aramaic to be compared directly to Dan. 7. Yet, Helge Kvanvig has rendered the appropriate portion of 1 En 14 back into Aramaic for comparison. Let us look at some of these possible parallels for illustrative purposes. (10) 1 En 14:18-23 חזית ואדיקת כרסא רם ורבותא רבתא יתבת ...לבושה חור מן תלגא רבא ומן תחות כרסא נפקין שבלץ די נור דלק נלנל כשמשא מנירא נור רב קדמוהי יקומוןיקומון ורבו רבץ קדמוהי יקומץ Dan. 7:9-10 חזה הרת עד די כרסון רמיו ועתיק יומץ יתב לבושה כתלג חור ושער ראשה כעמר נקא כרסיה שביבץ די־נור גלגלוהי נור דלק נהר די־נור נגד ונפק מךקדמוהי... ורבו רבץ קדמוהי יקומץ The affinities in Aramaic may be somewhat manufactured, but readers will still notice the prominent similarities in the spécifié imagery and in the overall structure of the throne visions. As Kvanvig points out, much of the imagery present in these throne visions is also found in the previous theophany traditions found in Ezek. 1 and Isa. 6, with the most obvious parallels being found in the merkebah vision of Ezek. 1. (11) On the other hand, Stokes draws attention to the fact that even though Kvanvig argues that 1 En 14 is more closely related to Ezek. 1 than Dan. 7, this does not determine the relationship between Dan. 7 and 1 En 14. It merely suggests that if 1 En 14 were (9) Collins, Daniel, 300. D. S. Russell also allows that both texts utilized a previous common tradition in The Method &amp; Message ofJewish Apocalyptic: 200 BC - AD AD 100 (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1964), 342.

(11) Kvanvig, "Henoch und der Menschensohn," 104-119.</page><page sequence="5">THE TRADITION OF THE THRONE VISION IN THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD 455 dépendant on the vision of Dan. 7, then the author of 1 En 14 could have used Ezek. 1 alongside the throne vision in Dan. 7 as sources. (12) Therefore, in order to discern the relationship between the throne visions of Daniel and 1 Enoch, it is necessary to explain the relation ship of their unique features that are absent from the previous pro phetic throne visions. Three of the most striking parallels between Dan. 7:9-10 and 1 En En 14:18-23 are not found in earlier prophétie traditions. First, both visions describe fire proceeding forth from the throne in the form of a river (1 En 14:18; Dan. 7:10). In Ezekiel's vision fire can be found in the middle of the cherubim beneath the divine throne (1:13), but it does not seem likely that the authors of the throne visions of Daniel and 1 En 14 would have independently adopted the same unique imagery of a river to describe this fire. Second, the throne vision in 1 Enoch Enoch describes the clothing of the enthroned figure as "[whiter than] much snow" (4QEnc 7:2; 13) (ת]לגא רב[א) while that of Daniel uses "white as snow" (7:9; כתלג חור). Finally, 1 En 14 and Dan. 7 both describe a multitude surrounding the deity by saying, "ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him" (1 En 14:22; Dan. 7:10 - רבו רבץ קדמוהי יקומוןיקומון). These three similarities, in addition to the over ail correspondences in content and narrative progression, reasonably establish a close relationship between the two texts worthy of inves tigation and explanation. Even though it is likely that both authors knew the merkebah vision in Ezek. 1, it does not seem reasonable to posit that they independently developed these unique similarities. (14) However, the acknowledgment of a relationship does not necessarily imply that one used the other as a literary source since it is possible that they both shared an unknown common source or tradition for this mutual information.

(14) Consequently, Glasson remarks, "Is it likely that two writers should inde pendently arrive at the same phrase, 'ten thousand times ten thousand', which occurs nowhere in the OT except in Dan. vii? The expression 'garment white as snow' occurs nowhere in the OT except Dan. vii.9. When we find virtually the identical expression in En. xiv among other similarities it is a strain on one's credulity to claim that noth ing but accidentai coïncidence has been at work, and that two writers who had read the OT passages mentioned should fortuitously hit upon the same phrases" ("The Son of Man Imagery," 88). (15) Kvanvig, "Henoch und der Menschensohn," 127. Here he notes, "Es last sich nicht bezweifeln, dass die Ûbereinstimmungen sehr gross sind. Es gibt aber die Môglichkeit, dass die Schilderungen des Thronsaals Gottes in beiden Fâllen von einem traditionellen Muster abhângig sind und darum nicht als Beweis direkter Beziehungen der Texte gelten konnen."</page><page sequence="6">JONATHAN R. TROTTER 456 Having established the relatedness of the visions in Dan. 7:9-10 and 1 En 14:18-23, an examination can be made into whether or not there is an identifiable direction of dependence as some have pro posed. Many arguments for a direct literary relationship note the dif ferences between the two texts and assert that one text seems to rein terpret or change the earlier text for apparent theological reasons. Some of the différences are as follows: • Dan. 7:9 mentions plural "thrones" (כרסון), whereas 1 En 14:18 has the singular, and shortly thereafter Daniel's account mentions the heavenly court (7:10), whereas the parallel por tion of 1 Enoch merely mentions that God "needed no counse lor; his every word was deed" (14:22). (16) • The deity is called "the Ancient of Days" (עתיק יומץ) in Dan. 7 in contrast to "the Great Glory" (ή δόξα ή μεγάλη) in 1 En 14, and in addition to the shared comparison of the deity's clothing to snow, both include unique aspects of the appearance of the deity. Daniel includes that his hair was "like lamb's wool" (7:9; כעמר נקא), and 1 Enoch additionally notes that "his clothing was like the appearance of the sun" (14:20; τά περιβόλαιον αύτοΰ ώς είδος ηλίου). • Twice 1 Enoch includes the effects of the glorious appearance of the deity on onlookers, which renders the speaker or other "flesh" unable to see (14:19, 21) and seems to have a similar effect on at least some of the heavenly creatures (14:21-23). • Each throne vision includes the description of the throne in différent narrative locations. Daniel places it after the descrip tion of the enthroned deity (7:9-10), and 1 Enoch situâtes it at the beginning of the theophany (14:18) immediately after the speaker notices the throne. Furthermore, 1 Enoch's sketch of the throne is more extensive including that the throne's appear ance was like ice and that cherubim surrounded it (14:18). Both of these détails not found in Daniel's vision have direct parai lelslels in Ezekiel's vision (1:5, 22). • While both accounts similarly express the multitude serving the deity, Daniel also initially includes that "a thousand thousands served him" (7:10; אלף אלפים ישמשונה), which is in parallel with the following inflation of the numbers. So the question that présents itself is whether or not it seems plausible that either of these authors used and adapted the other for his account of the throne vision and if there is any systematic or dis cernible editing process which would suggest such utilization. For (16) Translations of 1 Enoch are from Nickelsburg, 1 Enoch 1.</page><page sequence="7">THE TRADITION OF THE THRONE VISION IN THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD 457 example, Matthew Black suggests that the Danielic vision is an abridged version of the vision in 1 Enoch due to the brevity of some parallel expressions and depictions (e.g. "his raiment was white like snow"snow" instead of the longer "his raiment was brighter than the sun and whiter than any snow"). (17) However, it could be just as easily argued on this logic that the longer version is an expansion on an earlier less developed source. On the other hand, as is mentioned above, Stokes argues that it is not likely that the author of the Danielic vision would replace the unapproachable glorious deity of 1 En 14 with his "superbly anthro pomorphic gray-haired old man." (18) He also puts forth that 1 1 Enoch has intentionally altered the depiction of the divine court in the throne vision of Daniel for theological reasons, which accounts for the singular "throne" in 1 Enoch over against the plural in Daniel (19) as well as the replacement of the convening of the divine court in Dan. 7 with explicit mention of the independence of the deity in 1 1 Enoch. Stokes reasons that "it is also possible that the Enochic editor was uncomfortable with the perception of God as merely the chief justice of a heavenly court rather than the sole arbiter of judg ment. In any case, there can be little doubt that it is the Enochic version rather than the Danielic one that has made the éditorial move in this instance.'20) י) It is even more remarkable to consider the material in 1 En 14:18 23 without any parallel in Dan. 7:9-10 since it does have a seemingly consistent effect on the ténor of 1 Enoch's throne vision. The follow ing is a list of the unique elements of the vision in 1 En 14 that at the same time do not seem to be borrowings or developments from previ ous throne visions, especially Ezek. 1 : 1. 1. "And I was unable to see" (v. 19). 2. "And no angel could enter into this house and behold his face because of the splendor and glory; and no flesh could behold him" (v. 21). 3. "And none of those about him approached him" (v. 22). 4. "But he needed no counselor; his every word was deed" (v. 22).

(19) Grelot rather reasons that "Les trônes (au pluriel) mis en place pour le Dieu-Juge et ses assesseurs n'ont aucune contrepartie dans Hénoch; c'est que les assises du grand Jugement n'y sont jamais décrites, alors qu'elles constituent l'objet central de Dn„ VU" (79). (20) Stokes, "The Throne Visions," 349.</page><page sequence="8">JONATHAN R. TROTTER 458 These examples certainly give the throne vision in 1 Enoch a relatively acute emphasis on the transcendence of God when com pared to the vision of Daniel. Moreover, in addition to #4, the implica tions of which have already been mentioned, the other three could provide further evidence of Stokes's argument that the author of the vision of 1 Enoch intentionally altered the vision of Dan. 7 for theo logical reasons. However, the insertions of these détails emphasizing God's transcendence do not always parallel or comment on theologi cally difficult elements of the vision in Daniel. These three examples in 1 Enoch seem to disrupt the narrative progression of the description of the divine throne and appear to be in tension with what actually takes place according to the speaker. For example, after the description of the divine throne, the speaker curi ously notes "I was unable to see" (14:19) after which he immediately remarks, "And the Great Glory sat upon it [the throne]" and continues to describe the appearance of the deity. Even though this détail follows the description of the throne in 1 Enoch, which is differently located in Dan. 7, it still does not seem to comment on anything spécifié from the Danielic vision and is even in tension with its own account because the speaker himself sees God directly afterward. Similarly, the speaker in 1 Enoch's vision mentions that "no angel could enter into this house and behold his face because of the splendor and glory; and no flesh could behold him" (14:21) and "none of those about him approached him" (14:22). The former is located parallel to Daniel's comment about the hair of the deity and consequently could be regarded as a response to this comment as it specifically states that no one could "behold his face," but the speaker makes this comment about angels and not people, about whom his remark is much more général (i.e. "no flesh could behold him"). It does not seem that the speaker in either of these two throne visions has any problem with a human or heavenly créature seeing the deity, although the speaker in 1 Enoch appears to be more conflicted about this idea. In other words, these related addi tional comments (#1-3 above) in 1 Enoch do not appear to be theo logically motivated responses to spécifié content in the Danielic vision. Furthermore, the narrative in / En 14 seems to arbitrarily include these extraneous détails that do not appear to be connected to their narrative context in 1 En 14 in any particular way. With the removal of these four uniquely Enochic remarks, three of which have a similar theme, the two narratives are even more remarkably similar, at least in the content and order of the narrative. Still however, the proposition that 1 En 14 depended on the vision in Dan. 7 does not adequately explain the fact that the two throne visions contain common ideas and images and at the same time variable wording and ordering of the</page><page sequence="9">THE TRADITION OF THE THRONE VISION IN THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD 459 expression of those ideas and images. Very few of the mutual thoughts are expressed identically in both Dan. 7 and 1 En 14, except for part of the indication about the multitude serving around the throne (Dan. 7:10;7:10; 1 En 14:22). Relocated Daniel Text 1 1 En 14:18-23 Dan. 7:9-10 its wheels were [like] burning fire. A river of fire flowed, and went out from before him. And I was looking, And I saw a lofty throne; and its appearance was like ice; and its wheels were like the shining sun; and its &lt;guardians&gt; were cherubim; and from beneath the throne issued streams of flaming fire.

If the author of either vision were using the other as a literary source, one might expect to find closer linguistic affînities, or at least, the lack of these direct correspondences casts a significant degree of</page><page sequence="10">JONATHAN R. TROTTER 460 doubt on the suggestion of a direct literary relationship between the two throne visions. (21) Additionally, the transposition of the descrip tion of the throne in 1 Enoch (compared with Daniel's description in the third column above), which does not seem to have any apparent reason but does follow the progression of Ezekiel's merkebah vision, as well as the lingering différences in the language and imagery between the two descriptions leave the question of their direct rela tionship open. Put differently, both the position that Daniel relies on 1 Enoch or that 1 Enoch relies on the vision in Daniel does not seem to explain the following: (a) ail of the additional material in 1 Enoch does not demand to be seen as a direct reaction to Daniel's vision, which is necessary to suggest that 1 En 14 is a theologically motivated adapta tion of Dan. 7:9-10, and (b) the shared ideas with variable vocabulary and order within the two visions. However, the similarities in content, imagery, and certain vocabulary still imply some sort of relationship, which is why some scholars suggest a shared source or oral tradition used by both in writing their account. The proposai of a shared source encounters many of the same difficulties as the suggestion of a direct literary relationship. Therefore, it seems more accurate and construc tive in my mind to conclude that there was a shared oral tradition behind the throne visions of Dan. 7 and 1 En 14. As a resuit, the dif ferences between the two visions no longer need to be seen as possible reactions to the other or necessarily as reflecting the spécifié inten tions of either author since they could be earlier accretions to an already existing throne vision tradition. The différences in formulation of the throne vision in both vocabulary and order, while at the same time containing remarkable parallels, is precisely what we would expect from two works independently relying on a shared, but still slightlyslightly changing, oral tradition about the appearance of the divine throne. This also more effectively explains why each throne vision includes additional information about the characteristics of the throne or deity not present in the other (i.e. the parallel enumeration of the divine attendants in Daniel or the more lengthy description of the deity,s clothing in 1 Enoch) but also are not included or excluded for any particular reason. If ail of the unshared material in both visions is removed, it leaves the following core traditional narrative more or less : (a) A visionary (21) Although, I suppose one could argue that the différences in language are a resuit of the long transmission and translation process from the Semitic original to the Greek and Ethiopie witnesses. However, no one has made this suggestion and arguing for it does not seem fruitful.</page><page sequence="11">THE TRADITION OF THE THRONE VISION IN THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD 461 is looking and sees a throne with bright wheels from which fire pro ceeds, (b) God sits upon the throne clothed in brilliant white garb, and (c) a multitude of heavenly créatures surrounds the throne as servants of God. This again does not prove that an older oral tradition underlies both throne visions, but it is what one would expect if there were a commoncommon traditional background. It is also noteworthy that many of the détails of this core narrative do not seem to be very far removed from the earlier prophétie throne visions, particularly that of Ezekiel. Perhaps more detailed descriptions of the throne of YHWH attached themselves to and partially reshaped earlier descriptions of the divine throne during the Second Temple period. The authors of the Book of the the Watchers and Daniel attest to this tradition at différent stages and may have even contributed to its shape. Even though thus far the discussion of the possibility that both of the authors of 1 Enoch and Daniel utilized a common tradition has been spéculative, the Book of GiantsGiants (4Q530) from Qumran provides an important piece of evidence for this investigation as it may serve as another example of this tradi tion and so further substantiate the plausibility of its existence.

(25) However, the throne vision in the Book of Giants surprisingly has closer parallels to the Danielic throne vision, which will be discussed before returning to the question of the relationship of the Book of Giants to 1 En 14.

These similarities demonstrate sufficiently that a relationship exists between the passages/' (27) Yet the task still remains to establish the character of this relationship. (25) Milik, Enoch, 298. See also Martinez, Qumran and Apocalyptic, 114; Puech, DJD XXXI, 12-16. While still leaving open the spécifié possibility that the throne visions of both the Book of Giants and 1 Enoch rely on a common tradition, Stucken bruck extends this dependency of the whole Book of Giants on the Book of Watchers to the narrative contained in 4Q530 because both the Book of Watchers and 4Q530 share a unique tradition. He draws attention to 4Q530 6, 1.4 and 1 En 9:10, which although located in différent contexts, both present a human's pétition to God concern ing the destruction brought on by the giants (The Book of Giants from Qumran, 24-25).

God takes his seat for judgment, while "[A hundred hun]dreds were serving him, a thousand thousands [were worshipping] him," after which the books are opened. When comparing the throne visions of Daniel and the Book of Giants and taking into account their similari ties, two of which are différences between Dan. 7 and 1 En 14 (the plural "thrones'י and the mention of the opening of the books), it again looks like the relationship between the Book of Giants and Daniel is much closer than between the Book of Giants and 1 En 14. In order to understand the relationship between the Book of Giants Giants and Dan. 7, we also must consider the différences between the two passages, which are as follows: • While Daniel's thrones are in heaven, the location of the thrones in the Book of Giants is on earth, which is the same as Ezek. 1. • As was the case in the previous comparison between Dan. 7 and 1 En 14, the Book of Giants provides yet another name, "the Great Holy One" (קדישא רבא), for the deity. • The Book of Giants vision does not include a description of the appearance of either the deity or the divine throne. • There is a différence in the quantification of those surrounding the deity. Daniel describes that "a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand ten thousands stood before him" (אלף אלפים ישמשוגה ורבו רבץ קדמוהי יקומץ), but the Book of Giants has that "[a hundred hun]dreds were serving him, a thousand thousands [were worshipping] him" ([מאה מ]און לה משמשץ אלף אלפץ לה [סגדץ]). • After describing the heavenly attendants, the Book of Giants does not mention that these attendants had any rôle in the judgment. In the Danielic vision, the court sits (יתב) while in that of the Book of Giants they "[w]ere standing before him" .([ק]דמוהי הוא קאמץ) In light of these différences, Stuckenbruck concludes that the Danielic vision is structurally and theologically more complex than its counterpart in the Book of Giants and that it seems less likely that the author of the vision in the Book of Giants would remove détails regarding the deity or his throne. (28) Instead, it is more probable that QumranQumran Fifty Years After (eds. Stanley E. Porter and Craig A. Evans; Sheffield: Shef field Academic Press, 1997), 211-20.

TROTTER 464 the author of the throne vision in Daniel would have added these détails in consultation with Ezek. 1 and, as we have already suggested, some other tradition. In further attempt to distinguish the nature of the relationship between the throne visions of the Book of Giants and Daniel, Stokes brings attention to the différence between the descriptions of the attendants of the deity, which he sees as informative about the rela tionship between the two visions. He notes that the description in the Book Book of Giants goes in the same ideological direction as he argued 1 1 En En 14 did, which is to present the deity as the sole judge. The account in Daniel includes that the heavenly host served and stood before the deity and then sat with him in the divine court. On the other hand, the Book Book of Giants has two verbs describing the actions of the divine attendants (קאמץ ,משמשץ), the second of which is in direct contrast with the convening of the divine court by the seating of the heavenly host in Daniel. For Stokes, this is just another différence that shows the intentions of the author. He also adds that, since in the Book of Giants Giants ail the attendants stand, the initial référencé to the plural "thrones" is strange and perhaps this plural form is an unintentional leftover from the earlier tradition of which some expression is found in Dan. 7. (29) Ultimately, nevertheless, Stuckenbruck finds the différence between the numbers of heavenly attendants to be the most convincing piece of evidence against the proposai that the vision in the Book of Giants Giants relied on the vision in Daniel since it seems much more likely that these numbers would inflate rather than decrease through the development of the tradition. (30) This conclusion is in conflict with the argument that the Book of Giants relied on either Dan. 7:9-10 or 1 En 14:18-23 since both have the inflated numbers of divine attendants. The number of those around the divine throne provides yet another noticeable similarity and différence across the three throne visions exemplifying the complex literary relationship between them and the problems arising out of the identification of specifîc directions of dependence. Both the throne visions of Daniel and the Book of ing for the author of the throne vision of the Book ofGiants to present the sinful giants as having a comparable experience to the uniquely righteous Enoch or the prophet Ezekiel, which would allow that the author of the Book ofGiants actually had a more detailed version of the throne vision and excluded détails deemed to be privileged information (123).

Similarly see Stokes, "The Throne Visions," 355-56.</page><page sequence="15">THE TRADITION OF THE THRONE VISION IN THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD 465 GiantsGiants include two parallel phrases wherein the second multiplies the first, and they present the attendants performing the same action of service (Daniel - ישמשונה; Book of Giants - משמשץ לה). The account in 1 En 14 only includes a single line numbering the entourage, which is also the same content found in Daniel's second line, as is discussed above. In other words, in describing the divine attendants Daniel and the Book of Giants share narrative content, construction, and language - even though the numbers do not match - while Daniel and 1 En 14 share language and partial content. Another piece of evidence which does not fit very nicely into a fixed paradigm of direct influence is that there are three comments in the Danielic throne vision which do not have a parallel in 1 Enoch : (1) אלף אלפים ישמשונה (2) ,ושער ראשה כעמר נקא, and (3) דינא יתב וספרץ פתיחופתיחו. The second and third of these comments (omitting "the court sat") have a direct parallel in the Book of Giants, and thus it is not as easy to claim that the author of the Danielic vision generated them for the context when it does not seem that the account in the Book Book of Giants depended directly on Daniel. If we were to suggest that Daniel relied on the Book of the Giants, this would not explain the more detailed description of the heavenly attendants in the Book of Giants since otherwise Daniel's vision closely parallels the vision in the Book of Giants concerning the divine attendants. There is no apparent reason why the Danielic vision would not include further détail about the divine assembly if it were availa ble. On the other hand, proposing that the Book of Giants relies on Daniel does not explain the numerical différence. The complex nature of these différences alongside of the similarities does not lend itself to the conclusion of a simple literary relationship between these texts. It seems to me, Stuckenbruck accurately concludes, "Though it is difficult simply to maintain that Daniel borrowed the vision directly from the Book of Giants, the above considérations make it plausible that the latter work has preserved an earlier form of the throne theophany." (31) So the throne vision in the Book of the Giants does provide further evidence for the existence of the circulation and avail ability of various traditional descriptions of the divine throne. The more direct parallels between the Book of Giants and Daniel also bring some doubt about the dependency of the throne vision of the Book of Giants on that of 1 En 14, as is the case with the works (31) Stuckenbruck, "Daniel and Early Enoch Traditions in the Scrolls," 2.384. For a similar conclusion see Esther Eshel, "Possible Sources of the Book of Daniel" in The Book of Daniel: Composition and Reception (eds. John J. Collins and Peter W. Flint; Leiden: Brill, 2001), 2.387-94, esp. 2.390-92; Puech, DJD XXXI, 13-14.</page><page sequence="16">JONATHAN R. TROTTER 466 as a whole. It is especially noteworthy that little in the throne visions of 1 Enoch and the Book of Giants, other than an arguably limited ideological perspective on the transcendence of God, is remarkably similar or indispensable for explaining the relationship between these three texts. In sum, the throne visions of Dan. 7:9-10,1 En 14:18-23, and the Book Book of Giants have striking similarities in overall content, narrative progression, and vocabulary in isolated instances, some of which do not have known outside parallels. In the case of Dan. 7 and 1 En 14, despite these parallels, the différences in vocabulary and organization of these correspondences cautions against a particular conclusion about the existence of a literary relationship between the two visions. Rather, other oral traditions of the divine throne, which probably developed around the earlier prophétie theophanies, were utilized by the authors of Daniel and 1 En 14. The existence of such developing traditional material is further corroborated by the third différent throne vision in the Book of the Giants. The oral traditions underlying the throne visions in Daniel and 1 Enoch are very closely related but most likely underwent a certain degree of independent development prior to their inclusion in their respective works. Some of the particularities of each description of the divine throne may even be due to the work ings of the authors of Daniel and 1 En 14, but this is not certain. An attempt to reconstruct the original and secondary elements of this tra dition would simplify and undercut the variety of developing oral tra ditions. Concluding that there is not a direct literary relationship between these texts allows readers to see each text as part of a larger body of witnesses to scriptural interprétation during the Second Temple period rather than as one text responding to the other. If our understanding is correct and each source draws on the tradition independently at dif ferent times, then Dan. 7,1 En 14, and the Book ofthe Giants testify to a popularly held and enduring understanding of the nature and char acteristics of the divine throne during the Second Temple period.
