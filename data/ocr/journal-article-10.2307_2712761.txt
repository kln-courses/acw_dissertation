<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IMPORTANCE OF MARK TWAIN ALAN GRIBBEN University of Texas, Austin MARK TWAIN IS THE ONLY WRITER WE HAVE RECOGNIZED AS AN AUTHOR OF IM- mortal American prose after having branded him a "humorist." When in 1956 Floyd Stovall explained the selection process that included Mark Twain (along with Poe, Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, Melville, Whitman, and James) among the eight authors who deserved landmark bibliographical essays sponsored by the American Literature Group of the Modern Language Association, he could assume that "doubtless most readers will agree that at this time and for the purposes of this volume they are the most important American writers." If one adds two figures considered and then omitted-Howells and Dickinson-Twain's uniqueness is still evident. As a consequence of this reputation for humor, Twain's literary accomplishments were never taken for granted; in the beginning Howells, Brander Matthews, William Lyon Phelps, and others had to insist upon Twain's stature as a major American novelist. Yet even during Samuel Clemens's lifetime, encourag- ing signs of his rising status began to appear. In an era when universities bestowed honorary degrees less freely than some perhaps do today, three schools conferred doctorates on Clemens; the first of these, Yale University in 1901, produced a richly symbolic event: there sat Samuel Clemens, self-educated, a product of a rough-and-tumble border state and the strike-it-rich Far West, receiving the highest distinction awarded by a university whose curriculum had seemed conservative to the colonial poet John Trumbull. The cultural revolution betokened by this ceremony was probably no more apprehended by those in attendance than was the equally suggestive fact that Clemens had felt compelled to make his adoptive home the New England city where Trumbull and the Connecticut Wits had flourished. Inasmuch as Twain had found Connecticut-and the western regions where he had resided previously-to be suitable settings for his literature, the American literary independence, now completed attained, was merely being solemnized at this Yale proceeding, as it 'Eight American Authors: A Review of Research and Criticism, ed.

Norton, 1956), vi.</page><page sequence="2">The Importance of Mark Twain 31 later would be in similar ceremonies at the University of Missouri (1902) and at Oxford University (1907).2 Other tributes arrived as well. Professor Richard Burton declared in 1904 that Clemens was the "one living writer of indisputable genius" in the United States. That same year Clemens was among the first seven individuals selected by secret ballot for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The other six honorees-including authors William Dean Howells, Edmund Clarence Stedman, and John Hay-have never again been accorded that degree of public esteem, nor have most of those whom these seven people then elected, such as Thomas Bailey Aldrich and Charles Eliot Norton.3 In 1899, Brander Matthews had classed Twain with Cervantes and Moliere, and this sort of accolade, over the objections of certain dissenters in each succeeding decade, has gained many adherents. During Clemens's lifetime, Matthew Arnold, John Nichol, and Henry James were among the skeptics regarding his mounting reputation, but their reservations were balanced by the enthusiasm of commentators like Joel Chandler Harris, who in 1908 called Mark Twain "our greatest writer of fiction," and Howells, who termed him, memorably, the Lincoln of our literature. As Jay B. Hubbell has noted, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Twain's other works found admirers as eminent as Robert Louis Stevenson, Thomas Hardy, Andrew Lang, and George Bernard Shaw.4 Nevertheless, Mark Twain's literary stature has suffered, from time to time, because of his predilection for comic forms. In 1920, most notably, Van Wyck Brooks led his historic attack on Twain's credentials and achievements, though ensuing testimonials from authors, critics, teachers, and readers elevated Twain to a towering position among the masters of American literature. In the category of humor, indeed, his supremacy today is essentially unassailable, yet Jay B. Hubbell correctly observes that for the literary critic Mark Twain poses two special problems. First, he was a great humorist, and Brooks and other critics with little taste for humor have had great difficulty in assessing the value of his books. In the second place, Mark Twain was and still is enormously popular, and this disturbs the modern critics who seem to value only those writers whom they regard as alienated from society. This . . . is a main reason why they have made so much of his pessimism.' 2More than fifty years ago Vernon Louis Parrington discerned Twain's importance in this regard: "Here at last was . . . a native writer thinking his own thoughts, using his own eyes, speaking his own dialect-everything European fallen away, the last shred of feudal culture gone, local and western yet continental. . . . Yet in spite of a rare vein of humor, . . . he made his way slowly to polite recognition. For years he was regarded by authoritative critics as little more than a buffoon, an extravagant fun-maker with a broad streak of western coarseness." See The Beginnings of Critical Realism in America, 1860-1920 (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1930), 86. 3Larzer Ziff discusses some of the ironies of this election ceremony in The American 1890's: Life and Times of a Lost Generation (New York: Viking Press, 1966), 345-47. 4Jay B.

Demonstrably he bequeathed to the twentieth century a style of prose that speaks to us almost contemporarily, less impeded by outmoded linguistic locutions than that of any other humorist-or of virtually any writer, for that matter-of his day. His flexible voice even now comes through as vibrantly as though he were dictating those autobiographical recollections to us instead of to Albert Bigelow Paine and the stenographer Miss Hobby. That modulated voice emerged effectively in his works again and again, until eventually he came to believe that this narrative device alone was everything literature was about, that he could dispense with setting, dialect, manners, character development, even plot. He would progressively experiment with eliminating these other elements, one by one, in stories like "The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg" (1899) and "The $30,000 Bequest" (1904), culminating in the enchanting talk of his Autobiograph- ical Dictations, often faulted for their formlessness, but which can best be viewed as a reversion to Twain's earliest, favored form-a series of newspaper-type topical sketches and occasional columns, each perfectly intact and self-contained. Yet in spite of the distinctive "oral" style that Twain developed for his prose, he has never been the target of parodies like those that have mimicked the rhetoric of Poe, Cooper, Whitman, James, Crane, Hemingway, and Faulkner. Like these writers, Twain can momentarily seem windy, excitable, or pompous. Yet in the main, he succeeded in finding a sense of balance, forging a flexible style that conveys subtlety and density of meaning as well as the disarming fluidity of ordinary conversational speech. One of the less memorable of Twain's paragraphs in the least admired of his travel narratives, Following the Equator (1897), can still illustrate the suppleness of his delivery: In England any person below the heir who is caught with a rabbit in his possession must satisfactorily explain how it got there, or he will suffer fine and imprisonment, together with extinction of his peerage; in Bluff [,New Zealand], the cat found with a rabbit in its possession does not have to explain-everybody looks the other way; the person caught noticing would suffer fine and imprisonment, with extinction of peerage. This is a sure way to undermine the moral fabric of a cat. Thirty years from now there will not be a moral cat in New Zealand. Some think there is none there now. . . . All governments are more or less short-sighted: in England they fine the poacher, whereas he ought to be banished to New Zealand. New Zealand would pay his way, and give him wages.6 Hyperbole, anthropomorphism, the occasional idiomatic expression, and a jab at English law are evident in passages like this one. However, its ultimate effectiveness stems from the impression it delivers of a likable persona's actual speech, daringl) 6Mark Twain, Following the Equator (Hartford, Conn.: American Publishing, 1897), 285-86.</page><page sequence="4">The Importance of Mark Twain 33 punctuated with semicolons and structured around parallel phrases, then artfully frozen in print. Such paragraphs do not simply fool us, as Hemingway's dialogues and monologues succeed in doing, into erroneously supposing that people actually speak English that way (most excerpts from Hemingway's novels and short stories sound wooden and clumsy when read aloud, despite the verisimilitude they appear to exude on the page). In Twain's case, the majority of his tales and essays can be read orally without embarrassment to the reader; people may not talk in such carefully crafted units of punctuation and equipoise, but the rhythms and diction are harmoniously suited to the context and subject matter. Many of Mark Twain's verbal effects, of course, depended upon his skill in creating the form of address for one dominant speaker. Twain tinkered with vernacular approaches over and over again, often finding his way to workable combinations of story and tone, and once managing to invent a boy's monologue that ensured his place in all studies of fictional narrative. He always had an affection for this "aural" element in literary works, rehearsing oral readings of Robert Browning's verse monologues and Rudyard Kipling's ballads; his own fiction featured loquacious figures like Simon Wheeler, Uncle Mumford, Colonel Sellers, and even King Leopold. In A Tramp Abroad (1880), the comic model for travelers like Paul Theroux, which helps them chuckle at inconveniences and teaches them to acknowledge and cherish their inescapable attitudes of cultural superiority, the narrator gives the impression of an oral manner. To fully savor Twain's joke in chapter twenty-five of that work, however, a reader needs to review a typical account of chamois-hunting that appeared in Twain's day; then the subversive nature of Twain's assault on what Henry Nash Smith has variously termed "genteel bombast," "bookish phrases," "cliches of refinement and ideality," and "decadent high culture of the nineteenth century" also comes into focus.7 The following description appeared in a Philadelphia periodical a little more than a decade before Twain wrote A Tramp Abroad; I quote only a few sentences: The most courageous inhabitants of the Alps take a particular pleasure in looking for and killing the chamois in the wilds of the highest mountains. Great courage, presence of mind and perseverance is wanted in chamois hunting. With the thick-soled shoes, the iron-tipped stick, the pointed hat, ornamented with a chamois beard, and the double- barrel rifle, the hunter starts in the evening ... to surprise the chamois at their pasturages.... Often thick fogs come up, so that he can see but a few feet ahead; or a furious tempest breaks out, that threatens to precipitate the hunter into the abyss. It is no wonder that chamois-hunters lose their lives in falling down a gap in the ice, or a precipice; and, nevertheless, other inhabitants of the Alps undertake this dangerous chase.8 7Henry Nash Smith, Mark Twain: The Development of a Writer (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press/Belknap Press, 1962), 16, 17, 41; Smith, Democracy and the Novel: Popular Resistance to Classic American Writers (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1978), 119. 8"Chamois Hunting in the Alps" [anonymous], Saturday Night [Philadelphial, 7 Dec. 1867, 7.</page><page sequence="5">34 American Quarterly Twain's version of these heroics in A Tramp Abroad, a book that is currently undervalued and often out of print, comically expatiates on the vermin that infested his Swiss hotels: A great deal of romantic nonsense has been written about the Swiss chamois and the perils of hunting it, whereas the truth is that even women and children hunt it, and fearlessly; indeed, everybody hunts it; the hunting is going on all the time, day and night, in bed and out of it. It is poetic foolishness to hunt it with a gun; very few people do that. . . . The romancers always dress up the chamois hunter in a fanciful and picturesque costume, whereas the best way to hunt this game is to do it without any costume at all. The creature is a humbug in every way, and everything which has been written about it is sentimental exaggeration. It was no pleasure to me to find the chamois out, for he had been one of my pet illusions; all of my life it had been my dream to see him in his native wilds some day, and engage in the adventurous sport of chasing him from cliff to cliff. It is no pleasure to me to expose him, now, and destroy the reader's delight in him and respect for him, but still it must be done.9 His astonishing series of paired opposites in this passage, his scoffing attack on stilted "romantic nonsense," his undeterred insistence upon a mistaken identifi- cation, his confusion of mighty exploits with everyday nuisances-we recognize these as hallmarks of Twain's comic pose. They enabled him to exploit European guides, Turkish coffee, and Turkish baths (Innocents Abroad); stagecoach-travel, American Indians, and horse-auctions (Roughing It); river-piloting, Walter Scott, and Indian legends (Life on the Mississippi), and countless other materials that other writers seldom turned to their advantage. Yet in terms of most techniques that Twain employed, he was exemplary rather than unprecedented. Certainly "The Celebrated Jumping Frog" (1865), with its easily distracted monologist and his anecdote about the illness of Parson Walker's wife ("'it seemed as if they warn't going to save her"), is reminiscent of the Widow Bedott's rambling accounts of her family and neighbors, especially the recollections of her deceased husband Hezekiah: Why its an onaccountable fact that when that man died he hadent seen a well day in fifteen year, though when he was married and for five or six year after I shouldent desire to see a ruggeder man than what he was. But the time I'm speakin' of he'd been out o' health nigh upon ten year, and 0 dear sakes! how he had altered since the first time I ever see him! That was to a quiltin' to Squire Smith's a spell afore Sally was married. I'd no idee then that Sal Smith was a gwine to be married to Sam Pendergrass. She'd ben keepin' company with Mose Hewlitt, for better'n a year, and every body said that was a settled thing, and lo and behold! all of a sudding she up and took Sam Pendergrass.'0 9Mark Twain, A Tramp Abroad, Author's National Ed., 2 vols.

She could heft a bar'l of flour as easy as I can flirt a flapjack. And spin? Don't mention it! Independent? Humph! When Sile Hawkins come a-browsing around her, she let him know that for all his tin he couldn't trot in harness alongside of her." The comic plight, on the other hand, of the unwilling listener, trapped into hearing details about which he simply has no interest and gradually enmeshed in the spreading web of fact and anecdote, proved a fresh if reliable predicament in Twain's fiction. In its drollest variants he dramatizes the captive hearer's torture with tender solicitude. The offended genteel narrator who "frames" the Simon Wheeler story of "The Celebrated Jumping Frog" indignantly construes the tale as an attempt "to bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence . . .as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me," and his fate is shared by the Mark Twain character in "About Barbers" (1871), who emphasizes that he merely wants a quick shave so that he can catch a noontime train, then sits in agony while the loose-tongued barber, the prototype for Ring Lardner's dense barber in "Haircut," "lathered one side of my face thoroughly, and was about to lather the other, when a dog-fight attracted his attention, and he ran to the window and stayed and saw it out, losing two shillings on the result in bets with the other barbers, a thing which gave me great satisfaction." That last comment suggests how much Twain comes to detest this prating person who, as it turns out, owns a dog himself, and "strung out an account of the achievements of a six-ounce black and tan terrier of his till I heard the whistles blow for noon, and knew I was five minutes too late for the train. . . . The barber fell down and died of apoplexy two hours later. I am waiting over a day for my revenge-I am going to attend his funeral."'2 In chapter twenty-six of A Tramp Abroad, the situation humorously evokes the harangue that Coleridge's Wedding Guest endures: the Washington correspondent Riley pushes a captive "against an iron fence, buttonholed him, fastened him with his eye, like the ancient mariner," and proceeded to unfold the story of a government claim-seeker in the era of Andrew Jackson.'3 This habitual gambit of depicting the talkative narrator's audience as victim, "Mark Twain, Roughing It, ed.

Why he succeeded at this more lastingly and appealingly than his contemporary humorists is still a matter for discussion. In a slightly different connection, Ernest Earnest ascribes Twain's originality of style to the publishing practice for which he was criticized in his own day, and this explanation possibly has relevance here: "One reason that Mark Twain had been able to break new ground in the use of colloquial American English was that he published his books in the subscription press, that is through publishers whose salesmen took orders from door to door. He did this not in order to escape the restrictions of conservative editors but simply because he thought he could make more money. . . . The unsophisticated public who patronized the subscription publishers was less squeamish than the Anglophile editors, critics, and professors of literature." Henry Nash Smith adds: "This [subscription method] was probably a wise decision. It was a way for the writer to free himself from the dominant literary conventions. . . . He was forced to invent a new form and a new style in which to express himself.' 4 It is true that Mark Twain was one of the few humorists to avail himself of the awesome sales apparatus of the subscription-canvassing method. Yet this in itself cannot entirely account for why George Ade's clever fables and stories-even the marvelous "Dubley, '89," that amusing account of an alumnus's inappropriate speech at a dinner of the Beverly alumni-are practically forgotten today, along with the humorous productions of scores of other literary comedians like Petro- leum V. Nasby and Robert J. Burdette, while Twain reigns paramount in the field of American comedy. George Ade and the others primarily wrote their materials for specific newspapers (and newspaper syndicates)-the Chicago Record, the Toledo Blade, and the Burlington Daily Hawk Eye-as Twain did at the com- mencement of his writing career, an arrangement he was eventually able to abandon. When the newspaper wits collected their disparate columns for a pub- lisher, the resulting book often relied on repetitious devices and lacked genuine coherence and development. Bill Nye's Forty Liars, and Other Lies (1882), for example, is certainly entertaining in its way. Taking biased aim at Mormons, Ute and Sioux Indians, Chinese, newspaper editors, bandits, and the assassin Guiteau, Nye employs understatement and malapropism to advantage. The preface con- cedes: "There is a tacit admission . . . by the author that some little trifling falsehoods may have crept into the work, owing to the hurry and rush of prepara- tion.. . . I hope there will be no ill-feeling on the part of those who are mentioned personally. . . , and who are still alive, and comparatively vigorous."

Nye's remark about fashion-plate plug hats is entirely worthy of Twain's exaggerations: "In former years they used to hang a man who wore a plug hat west of the Missouri, but after awhile they found that it was a more cruel and horrible punishment to let him wear it, and chase it over the foot-hills when the frolicsome breeze caught it up and toyed with it, and lammed it against the broad brow of Laramie Peak." All the same, the miscellaneous nature of Forty Liars, despite its western flavor of tall tales and "lies," suggests the drawbacks of many such publications.'5 The fact is, the majority of American humorists-as Joel Chandler Harris proved with Sister Jane (1896) and Gabriel Tolliver (I1902)-were better equipped for the squib, the sketch, the story, or a heterogeneous collection of anecdotes and yams rather than extended fictional inventions of satire and plot. 16 Fortunately for Twain, he experimented intrepidly with numerous genres, moving from the hoax and burlesque to the travel sketch, the short story, the polemical essay, the monologue, and the novel; he was capable, as it turned out, of adequately (if haltingly) converting his talents for the purpose of lengthier efforts that needed greater control of form. In addition, he wrote voluminously; any minor author of the nineteenth century whose literary estate could successfully lay claim to even one tenth of Twain's writings would instantly be granted new respect and would duly be inserted in classroom textbooks. Our contemporary fascination with The Mysterious Stranger (1916), "The War Prayer" (1923), and other fiction and essays from Mark Twain's later phase-a departure from the taste of anthology editors of previous generations- indicates that modem readers admire Twain's courage in registering his moods and approve of the fact that his religious beliefs, social philosophies, and literary techniques must be studied in terms of different "periods" of his outlook. As a consequence, he seems engagingly honest and complex. The truth is, his late polemics and diatribes have accorded with the temper of our recent angry decades. There is an irony here, because, to take one instance, Samuel Clemens could not bring himself to copyright his favorite philosophical treatise What Is Man? (written "Edgar W. Nye, Forty Liars, and Other Lies (Chicago: Belford, Clark, 1882), 6, 199, 223. '6David E. E. Sloane notes, for example, that "after the Civil War, [Orpheus C.] Kerr, like the others, tried to write sustained fiction. The handful of novels he produced were only modestly successful." When the famous Artemus Ward died, Ward "had not attempted sustained fiction in any form, and the possibilities of American humor in that area remained untapped until the successes of Mark Twain."

Press, 1979), 24, 44.</page><page sequence="9">38 American Quarterly in 1898, published in 1906) in his own name, let alone sign the title page.17 It was not that any real harm could come to the distinguished author expressing these deterministic views about human conduct-rather, his misgivings involved the insecurity he often displayed about the public image he had created, that venerated Mark Twain persona he had projected skillfully and infallibly for so many years. Clemens the man was at odds with Twain the image in their final years, and this tension between the private and the public figure, his tragic and comic qualities, has become the dominant issue in Mark Twain commentary ever since. Alice Hegan Rice was shocked and embarrassed in August, 1909, when she visited Richard Watson Gilder and listened to Clemens lambasting the order of the universe; later she wrote, "I have an amusing recollection of Mr. Gilder leading me protectingly into the house on one of those occasions, and whispering, 'Don't listen to that blasphemous and unhappy old man!""18 Yet the disgust of Twain's associates went beyond the pall he could cast on a dinner party. They and his audience at large wanted America's foremost humorist to conclude his life with good cheer-to inspire all of us in our trudging circumstances, to set an example for the properly humorous departure from mortal existence. No doubt they hoped for an upbeat exit such as (the supposedly carefree, but actually crusty) William Saroyan tried to supply in 1981 when he telephoned the Associated Press to report, only slightly in advance, his own demise; with cheeky aplomb, the author of The Time of Our Life expressed nonchalant curiosity about the sequence of sensations he was soon to undergo. Mark Twain's mask trembled a bit toward the end, and he was not uniformly capable of jocular pronouncements. Yet he had the consolation of knowing that he had outstripped his competitors in the field of comedy, had indeed set a new record of longevity for his mass popularity. When he came to assess the reasons behind this phenomenal success, he would attribute it to the impatience with human foibles that he manifested more and more obsessively after 1895. His definitive explanation dates from 1906, when Twain dictated a screed about his fellow humorists that has become well known to literary historians. Glancing through the contents of an anthology of American humor that he had helped compile nearly twenty years earlier, Mark Twain's Library of Humor,'9 he con- cluded on July 13, 1906, that the book was now "a cemetery" and gloated about his own survival in contrast to the literary expiration of his many contemporaries: "Private secretary Isabel V. Lyon recorded on 9 May 1906: "It was this day that Mr. Clemens gave the Gospel Ms. to Mr. Frank Doubleday to take to start in on the publishing of 250 copies to be printed on the DeVinne press; not to be published in Mr. Clemens's name, not even to be copyrighted in his name."

Each and every one rose in my time, became conspicuous and popular, and by and by vanished. . . . There is probably not a youth of fifteen years of age in the country whose eye would light with recognition at the mention of any one of the seventy-eight names. Alluding to Nasby, Ward, Strauss, Derby, Burdette, Perkins, Kerr, O'Brien, Billings, and the Danbury News Man, he observed that their "writings and sayings were once in everybody's mouth but are now heard of no more and are no longer mentioned." Then he made the oft-quoted assertion that (in his opinion) accounted for his endurance: Why have they perished? Because they were merely humorists. . . . Often it is merely an odd trick of speech and of spelling, as in the case of Ward and Billings and Nasby . and presently the fashion passes and the fame along with it. . . Humor must not professedly teach, and it must not professedly preach, but it must do both if it would live forever. By forever, I mean thirty years.... I have always preached. That is the reason that I have lasted thirty years. . . . I was not writing the sermon for the sake of the humor. I should have written the sermon just the same. . . . I am saying these vain things in this frank way because I am a dead person speaking from the grave.11 Like much of Twain's autobiography, this is compelling and revelatory and quotable; for one thing, it recalls his declaration made forty years earlier (in a letter written from San Francisco to Orion and Mollie Clemens on October 19, 1865) that he had contemplated the prospect of becoming a preacher, but, lacking "the necessary stock in trade-i.e., religion," had yielded to "a 'call' to literature, of a low order-i.e., humorous."' Yet the statement of 1906 is not altogether as true as its currency today would imply. The volume to which Twain adverts contains specimens from forty-six authors, not seventy-eight. This is a minor matter, however; without question the book collected most of the humorists who were known by the 1 880s, and Twain mentally added others who had appeared on the scene in the succeeding decades. More significant is the overlooked fact that humorists like Petroleum V. Nasby, Josh Billings, and even Artemus Ward were undeniably-and frequently-serious in their writings. Whether criticizing draft-dodgers or ridiculing human avarice, they were scarcely the "phunny phellows" whom Mark Twain caricatures here. Moreover, Professor Brom Weber and others have pointed out that the Civil War humorists who elected to don "dialectal [sic] masks of semiliterates," depending on "quasi-phonetic misspelling, or eye dialect as it is termed by linguists," were inventive forerunners of realism because of this convention of "orthographic rearrangement."22 20Mark Twain in Eruption, ed.

Few of his early tales and sketches display examples of such "preaching." How much seriousness are we supposed to discern, for example, in his sketch titled "The Late Benjamin Franklin" (1870), in which the narrator complains that Franklin's maxim about "early to bed and early to rise" brought on his "present state of general debility"? "My parents used to have me up before nine o'clock in the morning sometimes when I was a boy, he avers. "If they had let me take my natural rest where would I have been now? Keeping store, no doubt, and respected by all." In the same sketch he scoffs because Franklin "was always proud of telling how he entered Philadelphia for the first time, with nothing in the world but two shillings in his pocket and four rolls of bread under his arm. But really, when you come to examine it critically, it was nothing. Anybody could have done it.' '23 It is similarly difficult to detect the "sermon" in "The Celebrated Jumping Frog," "Jim Wolfe and the Tom-Cats," "Jim Blaine and His Grandfather's Old Ram," "An Encounter with an Interviewer," "Jim Baker's Bluejay Yarn," and dozens of other tales. The fact is, Mark Twain was thinking in 1906 mainly of the literary works he had been publishing at that time. Perhaps he also had in mind the strident indictments that appeared in Following the Equator (1897). He had omitted humor to a dismal extent in "A Dog's Tale" (1903), "The Czar's Soliloquy" (1905), and What is Man? (which would be circulated in August 1906). Yet for many years most critics have taken Twain's self-analysis at face-value, principally because of his prestigious ranking in American humor; he is unquestionably preeminent among the humorists whom he names and dismisses. Also, the fervent tone of his professed dedication to "preaching" allays the inclination to look behind his words. Finally, and most important, Twain is conceptualized by teachers and critics primarily in terms of the single novel of his that they most teach and study, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885).There Mark Twain did seem to be inculcating lessons about human nature and social behavior; we readers come away from that book feeling that we have learned a good deal more than Huck has concerning our fellow human beings, their gullibility, their greed, and their strivings for fellowship and self-respect. The prominence of this novel has colored our responses to Twain's appraisal of himself in 1906, and the latter credo does not merit the acceptance it has gained. After all, he made these sweeping generaliza- tions about every American humorist he knew, and about the entirety of his own humor-and these opinions are simply the fond wishes of an elderly author rather than historical truth. Twain's reflections, however, do raise questions that have engrossed scholars for a number of years. For the most part, those who have given thought to these topics 23Mark Twain, "The Late Benjamin Franklin," in Mark Twain's Sketches, New and Old, 277.</page><page sequence="12">The Importance of Mark Twain 41 have agreed that Twain is superior to his brethren, being possibly the leading humorist whom the United States has produced in any century; but they point out that his favorite ploys-understatement, black dialect, exaggeration, burlesque, incongruity, deadpan vernacular, and others-were used by his contemporaries and those who preceded them. James M. Cox declares of A.B. Longstreet, J.J. Hooper, J.G. Baldwin, T.B. Thorpe, Henry Clay Lewis, and G.W. Harris: "All these humorists might have been forgotten had not Mark Twain, whose whole genius was rooted in the [Southern] tradition, made his way into the dominant culture." M. Thomas Inge adds: "The importance of the work of the group of writers known as the Southwestern Humorists to the mainstream of American literature received only slight critical recognition until it was observed that it furnished a literary background for and influenced much of the writings of Mark Twain."24 Indeed, these early Southern humorists' fiction is virtually as inaccessible and baffling to most American readers today as an unglossed page of Shakespeare's history plays; the dialects, folkways, costumes, oaths, drinks, and romps of Sut Lovingood, Simon Suggs, and other rustic characters seem as strange and intimidating to many present-day students as the speech and behavior of Prince Hal and Falstaff.25 Still, ephemeral Southern materials had their place in Mark Twain's development; it has often been pointed out, for example, that Twain's first famous story about the jumping frog was formerly an oral anecdote in the Old Southwestern tradition of humor, that its "frame" narrator bore resemblances to the gentlemen who introduced stories by Thorpe, Longstreet, and others, and that its dialect rests on perhaps forty years of written dialect humor.26 Mark Twain also formed part of an even larger tradition, that of "rural humor," in the company of Josiah Allen's wife (Marietta Holley), the Danbury News Man (James Bailey), Robert Burdette, Bill Nye (Edgar W. Nye), Max Adeler (Charles Heber Clark), M. Quad (Charles B. Lewis), and Peck's Bad Boy (George Wilbur Peck). C. Carroll Hollis, admitting that "there is no. . . Rabelais, no Cervantes, . . . except for Mark Twain" among the rural comedians, asks, "Why is it then that Clemens is remembered and Nye and the others forgotten?" He answers that, among other advantages, Mark Twain's subjects did not date so quickly. This point especially is worth noting. Lewis Leary has remarked that much of Oliver Wendell Holmes's "humor is so topical that, unlike his one-horse shay, it failed even to outlive its century," and Louis B. Wright has stressed something that we all know intuitively: "Humor is a very 24James M. Cox, "Humor of the Old Southwest," in Rubin, ed., The Comic Imagination, 112; M. Thomas Inge, ed., The Frontier Humorists: Critical Views (Hamden, Conn.: Archon, 1975), 266. 251n fact, there has been a recent attempt to salvage selected nineteenth-century humorous stories by preparing "modernized texts," in The Mirth of a Nation: America's Great Dialect Humor, ed. Walter Blair and Raven I. McDavid, Jr. (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1983). 26See, for instance, Kenneth S. Lynn, ed., The Comic Tradition in America: An Anthology (London: Victor Gollancz, 1958), 335.</page><page sequence="13">42 American Quarterly perishable commodity."27 Mark Twain, however, seems funny without any foot- notes supplying the historical, political, and literary contexts (as Charles Neider has repeatedly demonstrated with his scissors-and-paste editions of Twain's writ- ings). Human responses remain the same, even when customs alter; the sexually embarrassed purchaser of kid gloves in Gibraltar ("I was hot, vexed, confused, but still happy; but I hated the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in the proceedings") is ever amusing for his mortification whenever we readers open chapter seven of The Innocents Abroad (1869). Beyond erotic innuendoes, this narrator fully typifies the American reaction to all that is foreign, complicated, and assuredly elegant. Equally timeless is the anecdote in Roughing It about the liar named Markiss whom Mark Twain met on the island of Maui, a man compulsively determined to top every conversationalist's story with the tale of his own smoking chimney, huge tree, fast horse, parsimonious employer, until he acquires such a reputation for mendacity that a coroner's jury refuses to believe Markiss's handwritten suicide note, despite every evidence that he has hanged himself, and returns a verdict of "death 'by the hands of some person or persons unknown."' This lying character ruins Mark Twain's stay on the island, he would have us suppose, and indeed every such encounter, abroad or at home, illustrates how easily American naivete can be taken advantage of; but his narrator is invariably grateful for the educating experience. In Honolulu, to pick an example, he luxuriates in the abundance of edible fruits-oranges, pineapples, bananas, mangoes, guavas, melons: Then there is the tamarind. I thought tamarinds were made to eat, but that was probably not the idea. I ate several, and it seemed to me that they were rather sour that year. They pursed up my lips, till they resembled the stem-end of a tomato, and I had to take my sustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours. They sharpened my teeth till I could have shaved with them, and gave them a "wire edge" that I was afraid would stay; but a citizen said "no, it will come off when the enamel does" -which was comforting, at any rate. I found, afterward, that only strangers eat tamarinds-but they only eat them once.28 By means of such strategems, Mark Twain shouldered his way to the forefront of literary comedians, emerging from the main body of those writers boldly and permanently. Yet reasons can be found elsewhere than in his powers of absolute originality. He fared better than the rest by more skillfully blending and utilizing the range of techniques that they were already employing. Twain's writings, not 27C.

What, then, besides Mark Twain's mastery of a new dimension in oral-sounding prose, constitute his chief innovations? First and foremost, Leland Krauth seems correct in singling out the way Twain altered one of the tactics of Old Southwestern humor: "he changed the frame, that structural division between the conven- tional gentleman narrator and his vulgar heroes which created a separation between the author's world of order, reason, and morality, and the actor's life of disorder, violence, and amorality. Twain eliminated this division."29 Krauth is referring to the vernacular voice of Huckleberry Finn, but Henry Nash Smith gives this deduction a wider application: The straight character speaks in correct, even pedantic or pompous language which contrasts vividly with the incorrect but highly colored speech of the backwoods character. In Mark Twain's best writing (including of course Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) the vernacular spokesman takes over the narrative entirely; the straight character disappears and although his presence can still be felt behind the scenes or beneath the surface, the speech of the vernacular character becomes the only available narrative medium.30 Twain tried out composite "voices" in some of his early newspaper sketches; in a piece titled "The Reception at the President's" (1870), for instance, his persona is a voluble Washington visitor from the Nevada sagebrush who, intent upon describing desert scenes and personages to President Ulysses S. Grant, impedes a stately procession at the White House (another case of a storyteller's descent upon a cornered listener). Growing indignant when angry people in the line begin pressing against him from behind, the desert denizen whirls and confronts a hapless man at his rear who is being crushed by the growling mob; in high-toned, stuffy diction he reprimands the innocent, unoffending fellow: "My friend, your conduct grieves me to the heart. A dozen times at least your unseemly crowding has seriously interfered with the conversation I am holding with the President, and if the thing occurs again I shall take my hat and leave the premises." Yet it is the meek-looking man, amazed at such effrontery, who retorts with authentic colloquial speech: "I wish to the mischief you would! Where did you come from anyway, that you've got the unutterable cheek to spread yourself here and keep fifteen hundred people standing waiting half an hour to shake hands with the President?"'" Later, of course, Twain's creations like Hank Morgan would be 29Leland Krauth, "Mark Twain: The Victorian of Southwestern Humor," American Literature, 54 (1982), 377. 30Smith, Democracy and the Novel, 108.

This evolution was a significant accomplishment for American humor, and in the process Mark Twain capably modified the Old South- ern tradition of regional "dialect" until its tone, smoothed and tempered, became "vernacular" instead.32 For these contributions alone, his works merit special attention. Yet they have other characteristics that have ensured their importance to a later age. One of these traits is the tremendous range of Mark Twain's literary produc- tions. During a career spanning half a century, he tried his hand at numerous categories and subgenres of literature, including detective fiction, scatology, maxims, science fiction, and political pamphlets. The diversity of his enormous canon would have had little lasting effect if these experiments had lacked quality. Every scholar of humor (vainly) makes the point that Twain borrowed nearly every device or trick that our textbooks now glibly give him the credit for inventing, but such quibbles have had no impact on Twain's popularity. College students are aware of the river raftsmen's boasts, if familiar with such folklore at all, through the discarded chapter from Huckleberry Finn that became the nucleus of chapter three in Life on the Mississippi (1883), with its bragging by Bob and the Child of Calamity: Look at me! I take nineteen alligators and a bar'l of whiskey for breakfast when I'm in robust health, and a bushel of rattlesnakes and a dead body when I'm ailing! ... Whoo-oop! Stand back and give me room according to my strength! Blood's my natural drink, and the wail of the dying is music to my ear!33 A dozen humorists and local colorists, preceded by anonymous newspaper and magazine sketch-writers, had reported these ritualistic face-offs in comparable detail before. Yet Mark Twain incorporated them into books, books that sold well by subscription. What is more, he gradually assembled these books into a corpus that chronicles a narrator's adventures in four diverse regions of the United States and several parts of Europe. Thus the individual incidents and passages gain magnitude by their inclusion in an epic account of life in the nineteenth century, like the prodigious record of English existence that Charles Dickens left behind. Too, it must be said that this American, more than most of his fellow humorists, accepted challenges and took risks to overcome circumstances. Imagine Sam Clemens staying behind as a small-town Missouri newspaper editor. Impossible. It is even difficult to envision him as a longtime San Francisco columnist like Ambrose Bierce. That role simply does not fit our idea of his restless temperament. 32See esp. James M. Cox, Mark Twain: The Fate of Humor (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1966), 167. 33Mark Twain, Life on the Mississippi (Boston: James R. Osgood, 1883), 47.</page><page sequence="16">The Importance of Mark Twain 45 In Hannibal his family's poverty saved him from setting down roots, and imbued him with the aggrandizing wanderlust that helped him contribute an elan to our national scene. Through his travels, he came to embody an intrinsically American characteristic: refusing to be impressed when expected to be-particularly when ushered into the presence of so-called "culture." No one at the time fully apprehended his feat in bridging the West by vanquishing the codes of the East, and doing so more effectively than Bret Harte, as it turned out. Born in Missouri, schooled in the colorful regions of Nevada and California, Twain went east to master the necessary economic and literary formulas. Americans rewarded this venturesomeness by adopting him as a unifying legend for the nation as a whole. The generations of humorists who succeeded Mark Twain were largely college- educated, and they had often served on the staffs of college humor magazines rather than local newspapers-people like Robert Benchley and Heywood Broun (Harvard), George Ade (Purdue), Alexander Woollcott (Hamilton), Donald Ogden Stewart and Clarence Day (Yale), John Kendrick Bangs (Columbia College), James Thurber (Ohio State), Max Shulman (Minnesota), Frank Sullivan and E.B. White (Cornell), and S.J. Perelman (Brown). University training inevitably led American humor away from the rural or homely styles of Artemus Ward, Petro- leum V. Nasby, Orpheus C. Kerr, Josh Billings, Bill Nye, and Robert J. Burdette, though some exceptions (like Finley Peter Dunne, Damon Runyon, Will Rogers, and H. Allen Smith) survived and flourished without the benefits of higher education or ostensibly sophisticated styles. Robert Benchley, however, makes a superb example of the emerging mode that would become dominant, and some of his writings show an affinity with Twain's. There is a Twain-like tone to Benchley's "Ladies Wild," a waggish invective against parlor card games (or, for that matter, any games except regular poker): "I became the spoil-sport of the party again, and once or twice I caught them trying to slip the deal past me, as if by mistake. . . . They had finally got it down to a game where everything was wild but the black nines, and everyone was trying for 'low.' "i4 Professor Norris W. Yates notes that the most important feature of Benchley's humor was a character-type which may be labeled the "Little Man." In the nineteenth century, John Phoenix, Charles Heber Clark, and others sometimes depicted gentle, bewildered fumblers trying unsuccessfully to cope with an environment too big and too complex for them.35 Mark Twain's most analogous story in this vein is titled "Playing Courier" 34Robert Benchley, "Ladies Wild," in A Carnival of Modern Humor, ed. P. G. Wodehouse and Scott Meredith (New York: Delcorte Press, 1967), 16; previously published in The Benchley Roundup, ed. Nathaniel Benchley (New York: Harper and Row, 1938). 35Norris W.

Attempting to arrange all of the details for his family's travel between Geneva and Bayreuth, the narrator stubbornly refuses to employ a courier to assist him. A series of mishaps plagues his efforts, capped finally by his stupid purchase of lottery tickets under the impression that he is buying railway tickets. "I affected to be greatly amused; it is all one can do in such circumstances; it is all one can do, and yet there is no value in it; it deceives nobody, and you can see that everybody around pities you and is ashamed of you." When his family learns that he has additionally lost both their baggage and their hotel rooms, they are openly dismayed. They would skip over a thousand creditable features to remark upon and reiterate and fuss about just one fact, . . .-the fact that I elected myself courier in Geneva, and put in work enough to carry a circus to Jerusalem, and yet never even got my gang out of town. I finally said I didn't wish to hear any more about the subject, it made me tired.36 Few other authors besides James Thurber have employed this sort of understate- ment so efficaciously in behalf of the "Little Man." It is conceivable, if Samuel Clemens had somehow lived two decades longer, that he might have joined the set of writers associated with the New Yorker magazine-Benchley, White, Sullivan, Thurber, John O'Hara, Dorothy Parker (and later, Corey Ford, S.J. Perelman, A.J. Liebling, and the others). Would Twain have become a revered member of the Algonquin Hotel crowd, slicing away with scalpel-like wit while seated with George Kaufman at the famous Round Table? Would he have appeared in the pages of the same magazine that today carries Woody Allen's casuals? Quite likely, for Mark Twain was ever alert to the winds of comedic change. Mark Twain became, after all, "Mark Twain"; his legend grew, at his encouragement, and he grew along with it as man and writer. It is exceedingly difficult to live within the confines of expectations harbored by one's public; stage and screen personalities and even novelists like Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., and Norman Mailer, whose private lives are spotlighted relentlessly, can tire of their own aura. Yet Clemens adapted to this excruciating role, thrived in it, and died in the process of adding new dimensions to it. This is an astounding achievement, one that has not yet been adequately appreciated by his biographers. 37 The early hunger for renown by a river-village youth cannot account for the energy that the mature Clemens lavished in shoring up his public image; it is easy to understand why so many sentimental commentators have gushed about the "original" character whom he left behind for future ages. As his image came into focus, Mark Twain knew by instinct what Americans wanted and needed in the way of mythic figures, and he provided one that will evidently last as long as our 36Mark Twain, "Playing Courier," collected in The American Claimant and Other Stories and Sketches (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1898), 505-08. 37However, Louis J. Budd's recent book, Our Mark Twain: The Making of His Public Personality (Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1983), begins to address this fascinating topic.</page><page sequence="18">The Importance of Mark Twain 47 country.38 No one else had the diplomacy, talent, audacity, or the desire requisite to leave behind that majestic, white-maned, ingratiating image in our collective mind. For most students and many teachers, Mark Twain embodies what is memorable and noteworthy about the post-Civil War decades of literary realism and our national experience. Thinking about Twain's importance to American literature and humor, one finds it almost impossible to disagree with commonplaces of literary history that seem in little danger of being overturned. Mark Twain did signal the end of the American Romantic era, as survey works and textbooks announce routinely.39 Although Mark Twain's collected literary criticism has yet to appear as a volume in the Mark Twain Papers Series, a few of his animadversions against Jane Austen, Sir Walter Scott, George Meredith, and others have made known his jocular attitude about critical principles and his devotion to realistic precepts of his own time. Unfairly but magnificently malicious, and as famous as Hemingway's eulogy to Huckle- berry Finn in Green Hills of Africa, Twain's "Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offences" has become a staple of anthologies and actually helps students sense the buried resentment against preceding Romantic writers that partially motivated Twain and other realist authors. In pieces like this one and in the marginalia in his copies of Bret Harte's works ("One of those brutal California stage-drivers could not be polite to a passenger,-&amp; not one of the guild ever 'sir'd' anybody, " he groused),40 Twain revealed himself as a close observer of detail, nuance, and diction-opening the way for less stuffy approaches to essays in literary criticism. He is undoubtedly one of the chief inspirations for the small but welcome band of academic wits-among them, Hamlin Hill, James M. Cox, John Gerber, Jesse Bier, Louis D. Rubin, Jr., Leslie Fiedler (Samuel Clemens Professor of English at SUNY-Buffalo), and John Seelye-who in the 1970s and 1980s could be enter- taining in their own right when reading conference papers or writing reviews and articles about American humor. Mark Twain's tone enabled them to realize that unbroken solemnity in discussing humor is simply asking for a pie in the face, or is at least inviting another Woody Allen lampoon in the New Yorker about the hilarious obtuseness of pompous professors. Mark Twain's aggregate influence is immeasurable, but we know at least that his 38In 1981, in recognition of this fact, the University of Alabama sponsored a national symposium titled "The Mythologizing of Mark Twain"; the papers delivered there (eight of them published by the Univ. of Alabama Press in 1984 as The Mythologizing of Mark Twain) examined various features of Twain's incredibly resilient legend. 39Lars Ahnebrink declares, typically, that "an obvious mainfestation that the old school was vanishing and a new era was about to dawn was exhibited in the parodies and attacks that Mark Twain aimed at romanticism."

'42 Scholars have discerned the impact of Mark Twain on the works of Ernest Hemingway, Sherwood Anderson, Thomas Wolfe, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and William Faulkner.43 If Mark Twain had never existed, if young Sam Clemens had succumbed to an early illness, as his family expected, or had he drowned in the Mississippi River, like several of his boyhood chums, then something in our literature would be tangibly missing, and we would know it. What we professors and students and readers would find lacking would be our linkage point with the nineteenth century, especially with its humor, in the form of an actual man whom we can admire and feel affection toward. Mark Twain is one of our few symbolic means of maintaining the crucial continuity between our past cultural heritage and our present-day attitudes. He is a reference figure for all of us, citizen-readers and artist-comedians, marking the common denominator of what we want to perceive to be the American character. As a public speaker and lecturer, indeed, Mark Twain was very possibly our last performing humorist who presented himself as a "general" personage- neither an easterner nor exactly a westerner, the embodiment instead of the entire sum of national regionalism, all parts equal, none predominating. This "ge- neric" persona, so different from Will Rogers's lariat-twirling actor, is equally remote from the ethnic shtick of Woody Allen and Richard Pryor or the urban neurosis of Joan Rivers and David Brenner. He has no direct, obvious successors, only his impersonators; the humor of our contemporary nightclubs is fragmented -and typecast. The foe of humbug, explicitly rebelling against outworn Romantic forms and themes, he detested high airs and smug complacency-putting him in the progression that has led to the stand-up insults of W.C. Fields as well as Lenny Bruce. Learning from Artemus Ward and others, Twain mastered discriminative les- sons of theatricality and publicity. Among other feats, he contrived his public 4"Ahnebrink, The Beginnings of Naturalism, 103, 144. 42Hubbell, Who Are the Major Writers?, 144. 43For Hemingway, see Richard Bridgman, The Colloquial Style in America (New York: Oxford Univ.

If the current generation of nonreading Americans is less familiar than their literate predecessors with the qualities of his lesser works, and some- times even with his greatest novels, at least he is often quoted from pulpits, in newspaper columns, and at lecturns. He has gained favor with academicians while retaining his hold on the taste of the ordinary reader, something that Poe's fiction accomplished but 0. Henry's failed to bring off. Mark Twain endures because he is greater than any of his possible classifi- cations-crackerbarrel philosopher, literary comedian, world traveler, realist, Naturalist, hoaxer, novelist, vernacular humorist, after-dinner speaker-with which he might be labeled. He did practically everything that was expected of a man of letters in his age, and he generally acquitted himself well in every department. He gave his countrymen pride in themselves, their humor, their literature. And he elevated the station of his calling: among Twain's achievements, one of his grandest was his success in making literary humor seem like a respectable profession. His wealth, his Nook Farm home, his fraternal relations with the in- fluential and the lionized-these and other signs of status laid a benediction on his career so lasting that all subsequent authors of comic sketches, stories, and novels owe him a large debt. He rescued the funnyman from the smudged-print pages of Billings, Phoenix, and Nasby and restored him to the honored tradition of Benjamin Franklin, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell. Moreover, Twain mixed seriousness and comedy so subtly in works like A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that he himself did not always understand his initial intentions, and he thus educated publishers and reviewers and readers about the deeper possibilities of humor, preparing American audiences for John Cheever, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Thomas Berger, John Barth, and others. American literature would have flourished without Mark Twain's contributions. Yet it would be stuffier, less colorful, less redolent of the river and the West, less alluring. He has given us, along with rich impressions of life on rafts, steamboats, stage coaches, railroad cars, and ocean ships, a reassurance that we are not traveling into some black hole of the future, that we have a renewable and accessible past that guarantees a sane and attainable future. By finding amusement in the writings and speeches of one American figure of the nineteenth century, we assuage disturbing anxieties about our historical and cultural isolation when we contemplate with misgivings the dawning age of computer technology, biological engineering, and galactic transportation. If we can palpably touch the steamboat pilot's wheel with Mark Twain, then our grip on the spaceship controls of the twenty-first century feels surer as we extend our capacity to shuttle a supply of humor into the farther reaches of human history.</page></plain_text>
