<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vnum pro multis caput : Myth, History, and Symbolic Imagery in Vergil's Palinurus Incident Surprisingly Vergil supplies us with two apparently contradictory versions of Palinurus' death ('). In the Fifth Book, told by the omniscient poet himself, with insight into the divine world - like that of the inspired aoidoi of the Homeric world, Neptunus coolly demands from Venus a sacrificial life in return for the promise of a calm passage to Italy : unus erit tantum amissum quem gurgite quaeres ; unum pro multis dabitur caput (5, 8 1 4-81 5) (2) Somnus then approaches Palinurus with a "bough steeped in Lethaean dew" (ramum Lethaeo rore madentem , 5, 854) which lulls the victim's "swimming lights" ( natantia lumina soluit , 5, 856). Palinurus then falls headlong into the water, in vain calling on his comrades through the night. In the second account, that of the Sixth Book, the subjective viewpoint of Palinurus himself presents apparently another version : he falls into the sea, and is borne over it "violently" for three days and nights. Finally he comes to shore "grasping with bent hands the harsh heads of a mountain" (presantemque uncis manibus capita aspera montis , 6, 360). There a barbarous people run him through "with a sword, in ignorance thinking him some great prize." The puzzling divergence of the two accounts has been a crux for traditional commentators (3). However, modern existentialist and structu- ( 1 ) The core of this article was originally given as a talk for the bimillenium of Vergil's death, at Fordham University. (2) The ritualistic tone can be detected by comparison with an old Roman prayer beginning Dinom em pa cantei Dinom deivo sub plecate - deorum ilium patrem canite/ deorum deo supplicate. (Varr., ling ., 7, 27, Versus lanuti , 1), printed in G. Pighi, La Poesia Religiosa Romana , Bologna, 1958, p. 24. (3) M. Lossau, Elpenor und Palinurus, in WS , 14 (1980), p. 102-124, believes, p. 120, that we have what Vergil intended, but his argumentation - based on Vergil's care with book endings and transitions - is not altogether convincing. T. Berres, Die Entstehung der</page><page sequence="2">VNUM PRO MULTIS CAPUT 777 raiist critics should find the passages very much to their liking, for its presentation of the same reality in different ways, or for the coincidence of opposites underlying apparent contradictions in one reality. The apparently contradictory statement of the second account is particularly apt for the Sixth Book of the Aeneid where the paradoxes serve to heighten the general confusion between illusion and reality, while the surrealist horror contributes to the overall magnitude of suffering, terror, and flux in the underworld. Whatever one's approach, the Palinurus incident gives us an excellent insight into Vergil's literary and compositional techniques. Impressio- nism, deliberate ambiguity, startling originality in working with literary tradition, the defeat of expectation, the creative use of language - all trademarks of Vergil's poetry, are here in abundance. Also present is the underpinning of Vergil's outlook on life - the achievement of outward goals on a grand scale but with dubious effect on inner integrity and values, and the destruction of life on a lesser scale. Important for understanding the passage are the mythological and epic background, the reflection of contemporary events, and the creation of symbolic imagery which gradually merges the steersman and the promontory. The promontory, Palinurus or less frequently Palinurum, at a point south of the Bay of Naples is the constant backdrop for the metamorphosis of the epic figure into the geographical landmark. Linguistically, too, Palinurus suggests Paliouros ("the contrary wind"), a name given to windy headlands in the Greek world (4). Aeneis , Wiesbaden, 1982, attempts to define the "genetic composition" of the Aeneid. The chapter on Palinurus (p. 250-281) attacks Buchheiťs harmonizing approach - V. Buchheit, Von der Entstehung der Aeneis , in Nachr. der Giessner Hochschulgesellschaft , 33 (1964), p. 131-143. It is impossible to reconcile the two versions. Berres, p. 281 , holds that Vergil would have reconciled the two versions. On "genetic" grounds he holds that VI was composed before V ; and this is the evidence on external grounds from Servius, ad Aen. IV, 323, and Donatus, Vita, 31 p. 16 D. - not cited by Berres. A much discussed problem is that of Liby co cursu (6, 338). Berres would take this as a reference to a storm which occurred on the voyage from Africa to Sicily, with the Palinurus incident later moved down to the end of book V (Berres, p. 259-265). See also E. Salottolo, Palinuro , in Rendiconti della Accademia di Archeologia, Lettere e Belle Arti, 27 (1952), p. 177-200, esp. 184 ; G. Thaniel, Ecce ... Palinurus , in Acta Classica , 15 (1972), p. 149-152 ; F. Jacob, L Episode de Palinure , in Et. Class., 20 (1952), p. 163-167. Perhaps Vergil wanted to incorporate the Palinurus scene into a more "theological' 4 framework after doing the first scene in book VI. The excellence of both versions, and the different effects of each may have prevented Vergil from harmonizing the two accounts. (4) Lossau, p. 113, surprisingly understands the etymology of Palinurus as analogous to kniovpoç (" Wächter am Achterteil des Schiffes ") a name apt for a steersman, found in</page><page sequence="3">778 F. E. BRENK As a literary figure Palinurus is almost totally the creation of Vergil, a magnificent expansion over the sources. Dionysios of Halikarnassos - probably drawing on the Sicilian historian Timaios, and reflecting earlier Greek conceptions about the area, presents quite a different version. Here Aeneas on leaving Sicily crosses the Tyrrhenian sea and anchors in the "harbor Palinouros" which received its name from the death of the pilot there. (1, 53, 2)(5). He is then a shadowy figure like Leucosia, Prochyta, and Caieta, three Trojan Women whose only call to fame exists in the nomenclature of the Bay of Naples - three islands and a promontory (6). Dionysios, and presumably his sources, seem rather explicit in the distinction between promontories and harbors. Both Palinurus and Misenum were promontories in Vergil's day, but Dionysios treats them as harbors : "the harbor named Palinouros" (or Palinouron) (xazà Xißkva tòv IlaXLvovpov) ; Misenos, a doublet of Palinouros, dies in the "deep and excellent harbor of the Opikians", (sic, Xißtva ßaOöv xai xaXòv ev ' Onixoïç ) which is named after him. In contrast Caieta is a promontory (âxpa&gt;Tr)pícú KaLTjri 7, 1.53.3). The epic tradition suggested a number of elements. First, in the Odyssey , Phrontis (Mindful) the helmsman of Menelaos, died a peaceful death through disease (i.e. "by the shafts of Apollo"), "one who excelled C/L, 6, 23, 70 and R. Merkelbach, in ZPE , 9 (1972), p. 83. A. G. McKay, Aeneas' Landfalls in Hesperia , in Greece and Rome , 14 (1967), p. 3-11, supports the meaning "windswept", "dangerous" for Palinurus, and takes Misenum as similar in origin ("hateful"). (5) McKay, p. 4, believes the Timaios information came through Varro. J. Perret, Les Origines de la Légende Troyenne de Rome , Paris, 1942, p. 119, thought that Timaios was responsible for turning Palinouros into a Trojan. R. J. Clark, Catabasis. Vergil and the Wisdom Tradition , Amsterdam, 1979, asserts, more logically, that the source was Varro or Polyhistor, used elsewhere by Dionysios and Vergil (p. 68). (6) Caieta, a grave site, might have some relationship to cremation (xolíelv) though Strabo (5, 233) claimed it was the Laconian equivalent of xotkov (bay). If Strabo is right it might help explain the Homeric xrjTáteiç translated "hollow" for Lakedaimon ; it might mean "full of many bays." Another possibility is that xaihaç (Dor., xacáSaç) means "having fissures produced by an earthquake." The names in the Bay of Naples could all be physically descriptive. Prochyta (from прохитг) "poured out") was formed by eruption from Vesuvius. Leukosia should mean something like "white island." Paliouros or Palinouros would mean "windy". Misenon might be a corruption of /jleglvóç for цеощерс- vóç "the southern end" ; i.e. of the land mass at the north of the Bay of Naples but there is also a wind called Meseus or Meses - which would fit Misenum into the category of promontories named after winds. In Augustan times a conscious effort was made to exploit the funereal tradition at the place. See McKay, p. 8-9.</page><page sequence="4">VNUM PRO MULTI S CAPUT 779 in getting through a storm" (7). In this passage, much ignored by Vergilian commentators, the burial of the steersman, in spite of the inconvenience it offers, contrasts strikingly with the situation of Palinurus, who does not receive burial from his friends : U)Ç Ô flEV E'&gt;6oL ХаТЕОХЕТ, EKELYÖßEVOg ПЕр ôSoïo, ôcpp' é'rapov dánzoL xai èni xzépEa xz epígelev. (Od., 3, 284-285) (8) Presumably Phrontis would have been buried on Cape Sounion, the place of his death, thus offering a similar geographical backdrop to the promontory in the Italian Mediterranean (9). The obvious model for Palinurus in Homer is Elpenor who in the underworld meets Odysseus, and demands burial, with a threat of divine vengeance : hOa a ETiEizoL, ávaf, xèXo^at 'ivr¡oaoQai e[leÏo * fir¡ ix äxXavzov aOanzov iw ònidEv xolzclXeLuelv, vogcplgOeíç, цг] zoL zi Oew ¡хтрща ybjûù'iai, àXXà fjLE xaxxfjcu oùv zeúxeolv, äoaa ¡jloí lazi, afjfxá zé [loi xeOoll noXifjç èni divi OaXáooriç, àvSpòç SuGzrjvoLo, xai eoooiiévoloi пивкобас • {Od., 11, 71-76) (10) (7) R. D. Williams, P. Vergili Moronis Aeneidos Liber Quintus , Oxford, 1960, p. 199 sees a parallel in "through the shafts of Apollo" i.e. peaceful death, which afflicts Phrontis, and Somnus which causes Palinurus' death. As P. C. Sestieri, Palinuro , in RAA , 24-25 (1949-1950), p. 45-69, notes, Phrontis appears in Polygnotos4 picture of the underworld in the Knidian Lesche at Delphi, a painting which seems to have influenced Vergil for the Sixth Book (See my article, Most Beautiful Horror: Baroque Touches in Vergil's Underworld , in CW , 73 (1979), p. 1-9). For a pilot of Menelaos, Kinaithon or Kinados, for whom a promontory was named and in legend later identified as a companion of Aeneas see Sestieri, p. 52 (Dion. Hal., RA , 1, 50, Paus, 3, 22, 10). A. Snodgrass, Les origines du culte des héros dans la Grèce antique , in G. Gnoli and J.-P. Vernant, eds., La Mort, Les Morts dans les Sociétés Anciennes , Cambridge, 1982, notes that the earliest offerings at Sounion seem to be to Phrontis as well as to Athena and Poseidon, and that frequently the cult of heroes seems to predate that of the gods (p. 113). There was a painting of the helmsman there. See C. Picard, L 'hérôon de Phrontis au Sunion , in RA , 6 (1940), p. 5-28. (8) "So Menelaos, though straining for the journey, was detained there, to bury his companion, and give him due rites." The text used is the OCT edition of T. W. Allen, Oxford, 1908/1917, for the Odyssey and 1902/1908, for the Iliad. For the English translations R. Lattimore, The Iliad of Homer , Chicago, 1951, and The Odyssey of Homer , New York, 1965, have been used. (9) McKay, one of the few to note the Phrontis reference, does not state, p. 4, whether he regards burial on a promontory as essential to the comparison, but the place of burial is certainly important. (10) "There at that time, my lord, I ask that you remember me, and do not go and leave me behind unwept, unburied, when you leave, for fear I might become the gods' curse</page><page sequence="5">780 F. E. BRENK The geographical details would certainly have attracted Vergil's eyes. Odysseus performs the requested pious duty, heaping up a mound ( tumbos ) and a column (stele ), and planting Elpenor 's oar there on a prominent headland, "weeping we buried him, shedding a growing tear, where the headland runs farthest out into the sea" : (piTpoùç S' асфа ra/xóvzeç, ов' àxpôzaroç npóex ' àxvq, ват oßEv äxvußevot, daXepòv xazà Sáxpv xéovteç. aùràp ènei vexpóç ť ¿xár¡ xaì reúxea vexpoü, ziißßov xaì im azi)Xr¡v èpúaavzeç nrjÇafiEv àxpozázeo zúijfico eùfjpeç èpezfióv. (Od., 12, 1 1-12H") Elements of heroic death, the cutting of the trees for the pyre, ritual lamentation, burning of the cadaver with the armor, and erection of the tumulus are stated in brief and largely formulaic language. The final line with the erection of the oar seems to be an addition to the formula, which already mentions the stele, and thus is more personal, poignant, and in a sense less heroic, a break with the tradition of Iliadic burial. The model for Palinurus' swim to land surely is the epic swim of Odysseus to the island of the Phaiakians, but Vergil has cruelly inverted the model through the slaughter of Palinurus once he has reached shore. Finally, Vergil adapted the appearance of the dead Patroklos to Achilleus in the Twenty Third book of the Iliad where the hero's friend appears to him at night, begging for burial so that he can cross the river of the underworld : upon you ; but burn me there with all my armor that belongs to me, and heap up a grave mound beside the beach of the gray sea, for an unhappy man, so that those to come will know of me." (11) "Then we cut logs, and where the extreme of the foreland jutted out, we buried him, sorrowful, shedding warm tears for him. But when the dead man had burned and the dead man's armor, piling the grave mound and pulling the gravestone to stand above it, we planted the well-shaped oar in the very top of the grave mound." Line 11 - ов' àxpórazoç npóex áxzř], "the extreme of the foreland" Lattimore's translation, gives the most natural reading of the expression but it also suggests "a very high headland" especially since Homer speaks of òxrfi fy' ote xLvrjoy Nóroç (//., 2, 395). Similarly àxpozàrco wßßco translated by Latti more as "in the very top of the grave mound" suggests "on a very high grave mound." In any case there is a semantic connection between ахротатод т Oßßog and axpwqpiov (see LSJ , s.v.). Vergil bends local tradition of burial in a harbor to fit epic tradition of burial on a height. But burial on a cliff over the sea also fits the epigrammatic tradition. See W. Peek, Griechische Grabgedichte , Berlin, 1960, p. 94 t 128 - a relief from Mykonos 2nd to 1st cent. B.C. (Athen Mitt ., 56 [1931], p. 122.4 ; GV , 703) where a woman lies on a windy cliff, leaving behind a husband and two children.</page><page sequence="6">VNUM PRO MULTIS CAPUT 781 où ßtv ßev ÇùjovToç àxrjSecg, âXXà Qavóvxoç, • dáuTE ßE òtti т áxiOTa, nùXaç ÄtSao nepiqaoj.

(//., 23, 70-76) (12) Vergil closely imitates the words of Homer, while accentuating the "watery passage" and waves. Patroklos asks for Achilleus4 hand as he departs, promising not to torment him once he has been burned on the pyre and can get "beyond the river", and pass into "wide-gated Aides" : xaí ßoi Sòç tt¡v хФ &gt; oXocpöpoßdL ' où yàp et' œutlç viooßCLL èÇ ÄtSao, ènrjv ßE nvpòç ХеХ&amp;хг]те. (//., 23, 75). From Homer then come several motifs, but drastically reshaped by Vergil and given a different tone, with particular stress on the innocence and anonymity of Palinurus (13). Odysseus, at least on the grounds of time religion, had offended Poseidon deeply in blinding and taunting his son. The last attack of Poseidon on Odysseus - the huge wave overwhelming him before the landing on the Phaiakian coast, is meant to humiliate him and inculcate respect for Poseidon's power, i.e. the sea, something which Palinurus has always respected. But though Neptunus plays the role of the Odyssean Poseidon, he has no particular grudge against Aeneas and his crew (14). Other more pessimistic elements are the description of Palinurus' swim which stresses night and darkness rather than daytime, and the savage irrationality of his murder in contrast to the humane and benign reception (12) "... but you were not careless of me when I lived, but only in death. Bury me as quickly as may be, let me pass through the gates of Hades. The souls, the images of dead men, hold me at a distance, and will not let me cross the river and mingle among them, but I wander as I am by Hades' house of the wide gates. And I call upon you in sorrow, give me your hand ; no longer shall I come back from death, once you give me my rite of burning." (13) Lossau, p. 106, notes Elpenor s moral failings, which distinguish him from Palinurus. So also C. P. Segal, Aeternum per Saecula Nomen. The Golden Bough and the Tragedy of History : Part /, in Arion, 4 (1965), p. 617-657 (646) ; Salottolo, p. 196 ; and E. N. Genovese, Deaths in the Aeneid, in Pacific Coast Philology , 10 (1975), p. 22-28. (14) Lossau, p. 122, directs attention to the pervading influence of the sacrificial theme in Vergil. The Homeric epic is essentially funereal, but not sacrificial.</page><page sequence="7">782 F. E. BRENK of Odysseus by the Phaiakians (15). Moreover, Odysseus4 trial had been alleviated by divine aid (the magic veil offered him by Ino the sea goddess) where Palinurus is totally bereft of supernatural assistance. Finally, Palinurus does not receive honorable burial from his friends, like Phrontis or Elpenor, but only as propitiation through the superstitious fears of his murderers. The differences in tone and ideology from Homer are particularly evident in the Vergilian description of Palinurus4 swim to and murder on the Italian shore. In Palinurus4 relation the victim stresses night, unlike the Homeric description, though emphasizing the magnitude and cruelty of the sea. But where Homer's Odysseus harbors thoughts of danger on landing, then receives unexpected safety and hospitality, Palinurus, expecting salvation, is suddenly murdered. Night is constantly associated with Palinurus, and Vergil would seem to give it symbolic value. His swim is described in terms of the night rather than in terms of day and night as in Homer (tris Notus hibernas immensa per aequora nodes , 6, 355). The god Somnus, a creature of the night, is Palinurus4 evil antagonist, and the reader's major encounter with Palinurus is in the dark and dank underworld. Even light seems to function ironically. When Palinurus beholds Italy, awaiting his murder, it is "on the fourth light" (uix lumine quarto , 6, 356), and he appeals unsuccessfully to Aeneas to carry him across the Styx, in terms of light imagery (per caeli iucundum lumen et auras , 6, 362). Thus Vergil's choice of darkness against Homer's more luminescent scenery seems to be intentional. Further symbolic use of the external backdrop would be Palinurus' vision of Italy from the top of a wave (prospexi Italiam summa sublimis ab unda , 6, 357) and the harsh mountain landscape, which correspond to the disturbing word for Palinurus' hands (uncis manibus , 6, 360), and the symbolic word for the instrument of death (ferro , 6, 361). Vergil also seems to play delicately with sound in the passage. Lines such as : prospexi Italiam summa sublimis ab unda (6, 357) quod te per caeli iucundum lumen et auras , (6, 363) (15) Segal, p. 649, notes the cruel, individualistic framework in which Palinurus' swim is set, vs. the Odyssean one. Man's depravity rather than the sea destroys him. Moreover, one should not underemphasize Palinurus' relationship to the irrational elements of wind and water.</page><page sequence="8">VNVM PRO MULTIS CAPUT 783 seem to contrast with lines like : tris Notus hibernas immensa per aequora noctes uexit me uiolentus aqua ; ... (6, 355-356) prensantemque uncis manibus capita aspera montis ferro inuasisset praedamque ignara putasset. (6, 360-361). The last group, phonetically, is certainly harsher and more disturbing. Part of Vergil's brilliance is the subtle adaptation of the externals of the Homeric narrative, avoiding too simplistic contrasts, while at the same time radically demythologizing and detheologizing the ideological context of the narrative. While his imitation of Homer adds somewhat to the shock of the eventual outcome, and contributes to "defeating expecta- tions", Vergil also hints throughout the passage at the tragic outcome of the swim. Clear indication of his close attention to the Homeric text is the suggestion of the temporal element while slightly modifying it - three nights on the sea vs. Homer's two days and two nights (6, 355 ; 5, 388), and the appearance of land on the fourth "light" vs. the appearance of land when Dawn (Eos) brings forth the third day (5, 390). Vergil imitates the Homeric use of a huge wave lifting the hero up so he can see land (дгуаЯоу vnò xúfiaroç ápOeíç. 5, 393), summa sublimis ab urida, 6, 356). Vergil's use of the wave motif here is actually more natural since in Homer a calm has ensued, while in Vergil the wave is part of the aftermath of the storm. His use of symbolic landscape - the harsh cliffs of the shoreline, actually follows the Homeric model where there are projecting headlands, reefs, and cliffs. (ÒAA ' àxzai ~poß)S]T£c Ěoav and áSeç те näyoi те, 5, 405). However, Vergil has given hints of tragedy as well. Notably absent is the simile of the sick father whose recovery is welcome to his children - used for Odysseus' happiness at seeing land, but at least unconsciously helping to evoke the salvation of the hero (5, 395-397) and his own return to his family. The extension of the temporal element in the Vergilian narrative is somewhat ominous as well. Odysseus typically "was wandering" during this time (5, 389), but the water "carried" Palinurus "violently" (6, 356). There is an absence of calm, and unlike Odysseus, who landed in a river bed "smooth of rocks" (5, 443), Palinurus finds himself "clinging to the harsh heads of the mountain" ( capita aspera montis , 6, 361). More significant and hardly unconscious is the demythologizing and detheologizing of the passage. Recourse to the difference between the</page><page sequence="9">784 F. E. BRENK omniscient poet and the individual is invalid on the grounds of literary precedent since all three elements - the external framework provided by the poet, the simile, and the hero, work in the Odyssey on a theological level. The poet and hero are aware of Ino and the veil with magical properties to save Odysseus. The poet is aware that Athene changed the course of the waves, sent good thoughts, and finally sleep. Odysseus himself attributed his successful swim to Zeus, was aware of the anger of Poseidon, and prayed to the river god to check the current. Further demythologizing and detheologizing is the introduction of the non- anthropomorphic dawn, the absence of prayer, and the removal of Poseidon-Neptunus and Zeus-Jupiter from the Vergilian account. One can only call Vergil's creation, in terms of literary history, a shocking "Epicurean" reinterpretation of the story. Palinurus is not exactly an Epicurean himself. He frames his account with testimony to the veracity of Apollo, and the need to obtain Venus' aid for crossing the water of the underworld. But Apollo's prophecy was for him treacherous double entendre and Venus does nothing to help Palinurus. Though the texture of the omniscient poet's objective description of Palinurus' death in Book Five is more tranquil, it is still ironically cruel. The symbolic use of the calm passage to Italy is tempered by the Vergilian demand for pathos. The Fifth Book reproduces an aspect of the Homeric poems, the apparent indifference of the divine world which views human suffering from a distance, itself ignorant of the existential meaning of death, intensifying human suffering through meddling and victimization. The apparent justification for the intervention of Neptunus which causes Palinurus' death is the need for human sacrifice. But this ancient element of literary mythology was particularly repulsive to classical sensitivities, and its introduction into a "modern" work would create surprise and shock. On an emotive level, the necessity for it is undercut by the apparent tranquility of the sea at the time Neptunus' demand is made, the absence of sacrilege - as in the case of Odysseus' hetairoi , and the lack of provocation, as in the case of Agamemnon and IphigeneiaC6). Vergil's anthropomorphism then, represents the more sinister meddling of the gods in traditional epic, paralleling the "Lucretian" cruelty of a world (16) Od., 12, 377-382, where Helios demands the lives of the hetairoi for eating his cattle. The picture here is cruel too, since they are faced with starvation, offer sacrifice, and promise to build a temple to Helios when they come home.</page><page sequence="10">VNVM PRO MULTIS CAPUT 785 which can be conceptualized without gods. Neptunus appears in a nautical tableau, including in his train the goddess Ino who had once saved Odysseus on his swim. The gaiety and artificiality of Neptunus' pompe contrasts with the savage plight of Palinurus as depicted through his own eyes later, in Book Six. The use of Somnus as an instrument in Palinurus4 death is also particularly "daimonic" or even diabolical. As a divine figure the Greek equivalent, Hypnos, appears in the Iliad, once as an insignificant, partially comic figure represented as a small bird, and then as a dignified figure of large enough stature to carry with Thanatos, a great warrior from the battlefield. The Fourteenth Book in tone and content separates itself from the rest of the Iliad (17). In it, Here, dismayed by the attack of the Trojans upon the Achaian ships - designed to vindicate the honor of Achilleus, sends Hypnos to Zeus that she may seduce him and enable her beloved favorites to stage a counterattack. Within the humorous, even Near Eastern background of this book, Hypnos is hardly depicted with dignity. There is an element of daring and treachery in his style, his action is directed against the Trojans, but the result of it is the death of many Achaians as well. However, his insignificance is symbolized by the minuscule and timid form which he takes, hiding in a pine tree as "a clear-voiced mountain bird that the gods call Chalchis and men Kymindis" : hO' "Ynvoç ¡lèv EßEive nápoç Aiòç òooe iStoOai, eiç èXázrfJ àvafiàç перщщетоу, i) тот' èv "ISfl [MxxpoTárri nscpuuta Sc' rjépoç ai6ép ' ïxavsv • ev6' f}OT otpwiv izEizvxaoiLèvoç eÍXoltívoiolv, opvidi Xiyupr} bjaXíyxLoç, r¡'&gt; т' èv opiaoi xaÀxíSa XLxXrjcrxouGL deoL, àvSpsç Sè xvßivSiv. (14, 286-291) (18). (17) On the difference of tone in this book, and the ancient Near Eastern background to the book see H. Erbse, Zeus und Here auf dem Idageberge. in "Antike und Abendland", 26 (1970), p. 93-1 12, and my article, Aphrodite's Girdle : No Way to Treat a Lady (¡liad. 14, 214-2231 in CB, 54 (1977), p. 17-20. (18) "There Sleep stayed, before the eyes of Zeus could light on him, and went up aloft a towering pine tree, the one that grew tallest at that time on Ida, and broke through the close air to the aether.

BRENK Vergil's appropriation of the Hypnos passages is very slight. The only linguistic possibility seems to be "came through the mist to the aither " (Si rjêpoç aWép' ïxavEv ev9' t¡ot' 14, 288) similar to cum leuis aetheris delapsus Somnus ab astris / aera dimouit tenebrosum (5, 838-839). But in Homer the description refers to the pine tree in which the god hides, not to Hypnos himself. One cannot deny here a sinister element in the epic portrayal of impersonal sleep. In the crisis of starvation on the isle of the cattle of Helios, Odysseus goes off to pray to the gods {Od., 12, 289-373). But while the gods send "sweet sleep" Eurylochos persuades the hetairoi to sacrifice the cattle of the sun, leading to the destruction of the crew and to Odysseus' own shipwreck and isolation on a "desert island" (19). However, sleep here is not personified, much of the sinister effect comes from the formulaic style, and elsewhere in the Odyssey sleep is presented as positive, hopeful, and a peculiar function of Athene (20). This leaves us with the principal Homeric model for Vergil, the funereal portrayal of Hypnos, along with Thanatos, as the divine pall- bearer of Sarpedon. There can be no doubt that this passage - one of the (19) This passage may have influenced Vergil. "Worn out by toil and sleep" {xaßäTco á8r¡xó Tag rjSè xai unvto, 12, 281), the hetairoi demand to land at the isle of Helios. Shortly after "sweet sleep" (vrjSvßog vnvoç, 12,311) comes upon them, a tempest forces them into a cave. The poet gives an entire formulaic line to the gods sending sleep to Odysseus : o i S' ãpa fioi yXuxùv ünvov kni ßXetpäpoioiv ixsuav. (12, 338) with the epithet "sweet". Later he complains that Zeus and the other gods lulled him into ate with "pitiless sleep" : r¡ ¡ie ¡ló! ' eíç äzT]v xoiii7]oaT£ vr¡Xeí utívüj , (12, 372). The epithets are significant here. For an appreciation of ate in this line see W. F. Wyatt, Homeric " ATH , in AJP , 103 (1982), p. 247-276, who, esp. p. 264-265, links ate to overindulgence. In art there is a sinister use of Hypnos. In an Attic red figured cup, early Fifth Cent. B.C. a tiny Hypnos perches on the chest of the giant Alkyoneus, lulled to sleep so Herakles can kill him. Reproduced in E. Vermeule, A spects of Death in Early Greek Art and Poetry , Berkeley, 1979, p. 152, fig. 6. Cf. D. Buitrón, Attic Vase Painting in New England Collections , Cambridge, Mass., 1972, # 49. See B. Andreae, Herakles und Alkyoneus, in JDAI , I, 77 (1962), p. 130-210, esp. p. 130. In Theognis, 207, Thanatos replaces Hypnos perched upon mens eyelids. In art the winged demon figure is converted to Thanatos ; A. Lesky, Eine neue Talos-Vase , in/M, 1973, p. 115-119 ; Vermeule, p. 245, note 12,. (20) This responsion element is beautifully done in the Odyssey. In 19, 588 ff. Penelope speaks of the necessity of sleep to Odysseus, who in disguise has just predicted his own return to her ; then Athene "sheds sweet sleep over her eyes" (19, 633-634). This is immediately followed by Odysseus' sleeplessness, followed by the appearance of Athena, who reassures him and "sheds sleep upon his eyes." (20, 54). In each case, including the cattle of the sun incident, the sleep formula is varied. This part of the Odyssey is excellently treated by N. Austin, A rchery at the Dark of the Moon , Berkeley, 1 975, p. 200- 237.</page><page sequence="12">VNUM PRO MULTIS CAPUT 787 most famous in the Iliad , was totally familiar to Vergil. The diabolical reinterpretation of the role of Somnus becomes clearer in the light of the Homeric precedent. Within the context of the impossibility of forestalling death, even brutal and disfiguring youthful slaughter, some redeeming compensation appears, honorable burial and the remembrance among one's friends of courage and accomplishment. Though Here uses the motif of honorable burial as an inducement to achieve her end, the sacrifice by Zeus of Sarpedon, one who stands in the way of Patroklos, that Here herself, an arch enemy of the Trojans, should initiate such a prospect also reveals the profound respect that the Homeric society had for honorable burial : aùràp ènfjv Sr¡ róv ye XLnr¡ фих&gt;1 xaL «íwv, ntßnsiv ßiv Qávaróv те tpépeiv xai vqSußov "Ynvov, «V ó *£ 8r¡ Auxirjç eùpeiïji 8i)ßov í'xcovrac, h/dá è mpxúoouoí xaoLyvryvoí те ётас те wßßco те &lt;rrí¡Xfl те • то yàp yépaç iati ÕavóvTojv. " (16, 453-457) (21) The passage was so important to the epic that the poet repeated it (16, 666-667), then paraphrased it (678-683). The scene was later immortalized in art, particularly in the Euphronios vase, where Hypnos is represented as an epic warrior, distinguishable only by his wings from the other heroes, and accompanied by Death (22). The conception is similar to the Vergilian description of Somnus in the guise of Phorbas, the companion of Aeneas. But while Vergil used the form of Phorbas for the appearance of Somnus, perhaps suggested to him by the Homeric passage, there is no clear linguistic parallel. In the case of Palinurus, however, a trace appears. A possible echo is in the haunting reversal of imagery : Sleep and Death put Sarpedon in (his) "rich deme" (xárfleaav èv ... níovi 8i)ßU&gt; , 16, 684). (2 1 ) "but after the soul and the years of his life have left him, then send Death to carry him away, and Sleep, who is painless, until they come with him to the countryside of broad Lykia where his brothers and countrymen shall give him due burial with tomb and gravestone. Such is the privilege of those who have perished." (22) Euphronios vase, Metropolitan, New York, 1972, 11.10. See also Vermeule, p. 38 and 148.

BRENK Sleep hurled Palinurus headlong into the "fluidy waves" {liquidas proiecit in undas , 5, 859) (23). Here the verbs xárdeoav and proiecit contrast in gentleness versus cruelty (24). Primal elements - the stability of the "rich deme" suggesting land, the coldness and transitoriness of the moving water, distinguish the use of Sleep in the two authors. The loss of the steering oar has some haunting literary parallels for epic voyagers approaching the underworld, as does the loss of the steers- man (25). One can think of the paddles left behind by Gilgamesh, Kirkels advice to Odysseus that he will need no pilot to reach the underworld (ßrj ri т öl rjYEßovog ye тсоОг] пара vyt peXéoOcoi Od ., 10, 505), the death of Tiphys, the steersman of the Argo in Apollonios4 Argonautica , and something with perhaps sources before Vergil, the approach of Charon s boat without oars (nullo remigio) in Seneca s Hercules Oetaeus , 1072. There is then a mystic quality to the boat as it approaches the shores near Avernus, which may draw somewhat on a feeling for the otherworldly, if not on actual literary precedents. One of the most significant features of Hellenistic, and to an even greater extent, Roman literature, is the interweaving of the contemporary present with the mythical and misty past. One of the features of the Palinurus incident neglected by the commentators may be the relationship of this death by sea to the emotional recollection of the uncertain naval operations in the maritime war between 38 and 36 BC(26). The Sixth (23) On formulaic grounds niovi бщф meaning "the rich fat" seems to have slipped into nlovi 8щса) "the rich deme" (people, homeland). See M. Nagler, Spontaneity and Tradition. A Study in the Oral Art of Homer , Berkeley, 1974, p. 37-44, esp. p. 42-43. Nagler thinks there is a suggestion that Sarpedon will be consumed by fire because of the sacrificial connotations of the allomorph. But the phrase also acquires a warm positive meaning through these connotations. (24) In Berres' very convincing description of the "generative" process of the two Palinurus' passages, Vergil having written first gubemaculum multa ui forte reuulsum , 6, 349, then composed cum puppis parte reuulsa/ cumque gubernaculo 5, 858-859). Somnus' action then appears particularly ruthless and violent and stretches the Homeric principle of double causality elaborated by A. Lesky, Göttliche und menschliche Motivation im homerischen Epos , in SB Heidelberg , 4 (1961). (25) See Clark, p. 1 60. One should add though that Gilgamesh does not lose part of his boat, but discards the paddles as he goes, that Elpenor s death reflects the loss of the pilot, and that the loss of part of the Argo in going through the Symplegades has something to do with the underworld is highly speculative. (26) McKay, p. 5, notes the shipwrecks off Capo Palinuro : 253 B.C., the Roman fleet returning from Panormus (Polyb., 1, 39. 1-6 ; Diod., 23, 19) ; 41 B.C., the near escape of Horace (Od., 3, 4, 28) ; the disaster in 36 B.C.

Like the Sixth Book, these operations moved from personal loss and pathos to resolution and hope. According to the legend, Augustus was so moved by Vergil's reading of the Sixth Book, that nimio fletu he and Octavia would have demanded silence if Vergil had not declared it was the end. But the setting of the book and the particular emphasis on death at sea in the beginning of the book, should have struck a special note of pathos in Augustus and his intimates. Vergil earlier in the A eneid had depicted one storm at sea off the coast of Carthage, and gave some attention to Leucaspis and Orontes, companions who lost their life at sea, but in the Aeneid the artistic depiction of death at sea is primarily divided between Palinurus, for the depiction of death, and Misenus for the depiction of burial. These four are representative of the hundreds of tragic deaths at sea in those years, and of Octavius' own peril. The fate of Palinurus even reproduces the geography and details from that war. These events need a brief summary. In 38 B.C. Octavius' designated flagship was destroyed in a storm while on its way to Italy (B.C., 5, 80). The event was considered to have dangerous religious overtones since public opinion suspected Octavius of impiety in violating the treaty made with Sextus. Later in 38, in the naval battle off Cumae, Octavius' vessels were dashed by a violent wind against the rocks (B.C., 5, 81). The event was then repeated that year in the straits of Sicily (B.C., 5, 85). Octavius himself is said to have leapt desperately onto the rocks as he attempted to save his men thrashing in the water. The sources tell us that he surveyed his burning ships from a mountain top, watching a terrible south wind (Notos) raising violent billows in the surging, confined channel. Much of the damage took place at night, vividly described by Appian (B.C., 5, 90). His vivid description orchestrates the cries of alarm and groans of pain falling on deaf ears, those falling overboard and hurled by the waves against the rocks, the fury of the wind increasing during the night, men perishing in the darkness, repetitions of groans and calls for help through the night, those trying to lift their heads above the water, the huge surrounding mountains, the whirlpool of the deep, "the darkness of the blackest night" (wxtòç iiáltora ¡xdaívt]g, B.C., 5, 90), the rolling surges - "a tempest unsurpassed in the memory of men." In his account Octavius fell a victim to depression, even fearing the threat of assassination (B.C. , 5, 91).</page><page sequence="15">790 F. E. BRENK More important for our purpose is the disaster in 36 B.C. off the promontory of Palinurus. Octavius chose the first of July, a day in honor of Julius Caesar after whom the month had recently been named. Sacrifices were performed in which the gods were besought to turn the bad omens (ал aiata rpanrjvai) against the victims (то xadápaia) instead of the fleet. They cast the entrails into the sea while the host chanted in unison (B.C., 5, 96). Magnificent lustrations were poured to Neptune and the "Waveless Sea". But on the third day as Octavius was rounding the promontory of Palinurus, Notos blew again, then changed into a south- wester (Libos). Ships crashed against the rocks during the day and the intensity of the storm increased during the night. Octavius helped those who had swum ashore, and buried the dead. The result forced him to postpone the war. In contrast Sextus elatedly offered sacrifice to the sea and to Neptune, whose son by adoption he had suddenly become, issued a coin with the significant word Neptuni upon it, and changed his scarlet cloak for one of sea-blue (B.C., 5, 97-100). Later in the year four legions were being transported by ship from Africa when they were attacked at sea. Two legions perished. Among them the few survivors, who had swum to shore, were hacked to pieces by Sextus' cavalry (B.C., 5, 104). Something similar then happened to part of Octavius' fleet when against orders it fled for Italy. Among those lost in the disaster, many who swam ashore were slaughtered or taken prisoner. Octavius reached Abala (near Tauromenium), "shattered in mind and body ... alone and overwhelmed by misfortune for companionship having only one armor bearer." Messala, whom ironically Octavius had earlier proscribed, came to his rescue (B.C., 5, 112-113). Octavius' contemporary, Velleius Paterculus, probably reflects the Augustan propaganda of the time : "though unconquerable by man, the young Caesar received a heavy blow at the hand of fortuna" : Sed uirum humana ope inuictum grauiter eo tempore fortuna concussit. (2, 79, 3). Fortuna is repeated three times in the brief passage of 2.79 concerning the disaster at sea (27). Though naval battles tend to be stylized in classical historians, there is a certain vividness (27) The Cambridge Ancient History, edd. S. A. Cook, F. E. Adcock, M. P. Charles- worth, Cambridge, 1934, voi. X, p. 60-61, portrays Octavius as attempting suicide after the battle off Messana, and Maecenas sent to Rome to quell the superstitious fears that Sextus had the gods on his sides. This seems to be an exaggeration and confusion over Appiani, B.C.. 5, 80 ; 5, 92 ; 5, 99, and 5, 112. According to Appiani, Octavius was devastated by the battle off Tauromenium (то тс aú¡¡ia xaì tt¡v &lt;puxřjv íotoX ßb/ov) and sent Maecenas to Rome to quell rebellion (B.C., 5, 112).</page><page sequence="16">VNUM PRO MULTIS CAPUT 791 in these scenes, reflecting a sense of desperation, which goes beyond the more sober accounts of naval disasters in Polybios' history of the First Punic War. The ideological or editorial tenor of the event in the historical sources is reflected in Vergil's two accounts, in one attributing Palinurus' misfortune to the gods, in the other to blind forces. Most impressive in the historical accounts is the importance of the Bay of Naples with the promontory Palinurus, the constant appearance of night, the prevalence of the south- east wind (Notus), storms at night, men crying out in the sea, or reaching shore and being killed by the sword. In the background one finds the cruelty of Neptune - if a divine cause is given, or a cruel fortuna, or simply cruel forces of the sea. Besides the brilliant incorporation of the geographic, mythical, and contemporary background into the Palinurus incident, Vergilian language and images gradually metamorphose Palinurus from living companion, into floating corpse, to a windy promontory with a necropolis (28). From the beginning he is associated with the open sky and sea ( caelum undique et undique pontus, 3, 193)(29). The partial line used by Vergil here, with its repetition and balance, contrasts the two immense antagonistic, impersonal forces. The next lines associated with him change from mere potential disorientation to horror : sheets of rain ( caeruleus imber , 3, 194), night, storm, and "a wave shuddering in the darknesses" (inhorruit unda tenebris, 3, 195), winds, huge surging expanses, clouds, damp nights, "fire in the clouds" and "wandering in blind waves" ( caecis erramus in undis, 3, 194-200). Further disorientation is introduced through the grow- ing predominance of night over day in his life. They wander in meteoro- logical and chronological chaos : tris adeo incertos caeca caligine soles (3. 203) without even the benefit of the stars. Further association of Palinurus with night and darkness appears later in the Third Book. As Aeneas and his companions approach Italy from (28) For the antiquity of the archaeological finds, going back to the Mycenaean period, see R.

Ridgway, Archaeology in South Italy, in Archaeological Reports for ¡981-1982 (Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies) (London 1982), p. 82-83.

BRENK the east a beneficial calm prevails - corresponding to Vergils symbolic conception of land and seascape. Vergil locates Palinurus in the night : he watches the stars and "catches the air with his ears" ( auribus aera capiat , 3, 514). Though the scene is calm, he gives the signal to depart at midnight. The passage through Charybdis for the first time associates the future shade and funereal promontory with the underworld. It is a descent to the place of the Manes : subducta ad M anis imos desedimus unda (3, 565). Here the watery element (unda) frames the funereal (Manis imos). The Fifth Book echoes Palinurus4 earlier associations with sea, sky, night, and the calm at night, but also introduces in all probability the linguistic play on Fsiinurus-Paliouros (contrary wind) apt for a promontory. At 5, 9, maria undique et undique caelum is a variation on caelum undique et undique pontus (3, 193). The rain formula is repeated verbatim except for grammatical variation, olii caeruleus supra caput astitit imber (5, 10) for tum mihi caeruleus supra caput astitit imber (3, 1 94). Palinurus4 complaint about the adverse wind hindering his approach to Italy echoes the ideological substructure of the incident as delineated both by the historical sources and by Vergil : Pater Neptunus and Fortuna stand in the way. Aeneas4 echo of Palinurus4 lines may be a kind of Alexandrian play on words (Palinurus-Paliouros) : пес nos obniti contra пес tendere tantum sufficimus ... (Palinurus , 5, 20-21) iamdudum et frustra cerno te tendere contra (Aeneas , 5, 27). Further imagery and language point backward to the Third Book and forward to the Sixth. Italy itself is described as though intimately associated with the underworld (portus Auerni). Neptunus4 words sound like a ritualistic incantation : и nus erit tantum, amissum quem gurgite quaeres ; unum pro multis dabitur caput (5, 814-815). As Palinurus approaches his death it is night, his characteristic time, a night associated with sky and water : iamque fere mediam caeli Nox umida metam contigerat ... (5, 835-836), suggesting the earlier formula : necdum orbem medium Nox Horis acta subibat (3, 512).</page><page sequence="18">VNUM PRO MULTI S CAPUT 793 The description of the arrival of Somnus suggests both night and under- world with its tenebrosum and umbras : aëra dimouit tenebrosum et dispulit umbras (5, 839). Aera for uentum recalls the earlier line for Palinurus : explorât uentos atque auribus aëra capiat (3, 514). The slight hint at the underworld in 5.839 becomes explicit in 5, 854 and 855. The instrument Somnus uses touches Vergilian motifs for the underworld : bough and Lethe (ramum Lethaeo rore madentem ), and Stygian power (ui soporatum Stygia ) (30). Madentem hints of water and later is slightly echoed in Palinurus' account, when speaking of his clothing ( madida cum ueste grauatum , 6, 359) as he climbs onto the shore. In both cases water is a debilitating element. Somnus uses the power of the underworld, more precisely, the water of the underworld uique soporatum Stygia (5, 855). Pointing also in the direction of eternal night and approaching death, while recalling the earlier darkness, Palinurus4 eyes - in poetic diction "lights" - are "swimming" ( natantia lumina ) as he falls into the element irrevocably associated with him (liquidas proiecit in undas) (5, 856 and 859) (31). In the subjective account of the Sixth Book, the theological elements as well as the imagery undergo a mutation rather than a complete transformation. Palinurus denies the influence of any divine causality : no deus was involved, but only blind, impersonal forces - surgentibus undis immensa aequora , nodes, aqua (uiolens) (6, 354-356). The land was as cruel as the sea. The "harsh heads of the mountains" which he clung to with his "hooked hands" - as he put it, offered no refuge. (30) According to McKay, p. 5, song, Lethe, the Sirens, and violent winds are associated with this part of the coast. Vergil may have deliberately wanted to include two different local traditions. The ramus was not a traditional attribute of Somnus ; see J. Hubaux, Pal inu re, in Et. Class ., 3 (1934), p. 174-194. (31) Palinurus' later invocation of Aeneas, per cael i iucundum lumen (6, 363), suggests again these thematic considerations of light and darkness. Prof. William Batstone believes that the Somnus incident has a parallel in the Juno episode at the end of Book Four - analyzed by W. R. Johnson , Darkness Visible. A Study of Vergil's Aeneid, Berkeley, 1976, p. 61 , where the subjective viewpoint of the god seems to be given. The scene also has a dramatic quality, as does the end of the Fourth Book, much like the appearance of gods at the end of Euripides' tragedies. That Palinurus does not fall into the sea, but is hurled into it suggests a sacrificial action, such as the hurling of the sacrificial entrails into the sea in the lustration of the fleet ; cf. Appian, B.C., 5, 96.</page><page sequence="19">794 F. E. BRENK The association of Palinurus in death with the rugged coastal shore structurally hints at the assimilation of the two. First almost entirely associated with the sea, Palinurus now becomes more closely associated with the shore ( litora ). The imagery used for his drifting body puts him in a no-man's land between sea and land : nunc me fluctus habet uersantque in litore uenti (6, 362). It is only a short step from there to his final identification with the promontory. The final, funereal part of the incident is also a masterpiece of variation on motif. Even in the underworld water becomes his hostile foe, an inescapable and ineluctable force reaching beyond the visible world. Though he asks Aeneas to take him with him over the water : da dextram misero et tecum me tolle per undas, sedibus ut saltem placidis in morte quiescam (6, 370-371). the request must be denied. The Sibyl warns him off but predicts that through "celestial portents" the natives will give him funeral rites : prodigiis acti caelestibus, ossa piabunt et statuent tumulum et tumulo sollemnia mittent aeternumque locus Palinuri nomen habebit (6, 379-381). Palinurus' struggles in the ancient version of a brave new world are further emphasized by innovations Vergil makes in his use of the Homeric model. Nor did Patroklos understand the grim laws for the dead when he asked Achilleus for his hand (xa¿ ¡iol Sòç тг/v xdp òÀorpúpoiíai -,//.,23,75). Achilleus in turn tried to embrace the image of Patroklos, thus attempting to exceed the physical limitations which separate the living from the dead. As frequently happens, Vergil spiritualizes and enlarges the dimensions of the Homeric archetype. Since Palinurus is a shade, he has the physical capacity to cross the Styx, but the lack of burial creates a spiritual impossibility. But there is also a literal sense to the request, the hand given to bring one into a boat, or the handclasp in affirmation of a request. Physically it is impossible for Aeneas to clasp the hand, psychologically it is impossible to give him burial, spiritually impossible to take him across the river. The distance between the two here is awesome. As for the Vergilian Orpheus, psychological and spiritual difficulties in the land of the dead prove far more powerful than physical ones. Finally the denial of the handclasp is especially pessimistic when one thinks of its importance in Athenian funerary art, where the departure of the dead is often</page><page sequence="20">VNUM PRO MULTIS CAPUT 195 signified by the extended right hand, and in Roman funerary art where the clasp of right hand expresses the deepest bonds of marriage, trust, and friendship. These iconographie connotations should not be neglected when we are dealing with a hero who will eventually become a necro- polis. The circumstances of his burial by strangers, possibly his murderers, are also pessimistic and symbolic. In spite of the ancient commentators who mention a plague, the caelestia prodigio seem more like meteoro- logical fireworks than an epidemic, and storms - so closely associated with the steersman, would certainly harmonize better with the technique used consistently in the Palinurus passages (32). Just as Vergil's modification of the physical details and emotional overtones of the heroic swim to land are directed to a pessimistic statement about life, so his use of the literary background for the epic funeral, makes the burial rites for Palinurus extremely ambiguous if not cruelly ironic. No friends honor his remains as a last token of friendship and respect, but enemies driven by superstition try to keep him still. Small wonder Vergil describes his elation as only temporary (pulsusque pa rumper/ corde dolor tristi ..., 6, 382-383). Surely the parumper is emphatic. Palinurus will receive a name, in a sense become a promontory, but it will be an ambiguous name. Forever he will be a mountain headland running into the sea, buffeted by wind and storm, lashed by waves, and haunted with the shades of the eerie necropolis upon its heights, a monument of the great disaster to Octavius' fleets - simultaneously epic monumental tomb and memorial to contemporary tragedy, haunted by the memory of cries in the night and men washed upon the shore ("). This devastatingly pessimistic fate of a minor character, almost a travesty of heroic burial, is only partially ameliorated by Vergil's sublime artistry, his delight in the power and pathos of evocative language and verse. If he meant to suggest here the value of human sacrifice, the value of those lives lost at sea in the Augustan wars, he did it in a very indirect (32) That there was a plague there is supported by the archaeological evidence (See e.g. E. Salottolo, p. 81), but Vergil would not be bound to associate the plague with propitiation to Palinurus. More logically in the epic framework, propitiation to Palinurus would have originated the burial site. (33) For the archaeology of the Palinurus promontory, including photographs, see Sestieri ; R. Naumann, Palinuro, Ergebnisse der Ausgrabungen, I, Heidelberg, 1958 ; R. Naumann andB. Nevtsch, Palinuro, Ergebnisse der Ausgrabungen, II, Heidelberg, 1960 ; and McKay, p. 4-5.</page><page sequence="21">796 F. E. BRENK and curious way. It is never clear why Neptunus needed a sacrifice, and the incident is presented in brutally unsentimental terms. It is true that in wars and victories many must die, and many in inglorious and trivial ways. Perhaps some would see significance in this death. As Palinurus dies but Aeneas reached Italy, so thousands died that the Augustan impérium might be attained. On a certain level the death of Palinurus might be a consolation. But it is a meaning only potentially in the poem, not one sentimentally presented to the reader. Between the cruel divine world of the surface theology of the Neptunus incident, and the Epicurean or Lucretian account of Palinurus himself, Vergil ambiguously portrays the relationship between sacrifice and goals, divine providence, the meaning of divine communication to men, and in effect, the sanity of a real or imaginable divine world (34). The Palinurus incident is then another example of the complex and multilayered approach to literature and the interpretation of life, which has been Vergils distinctive trade- mark and influence (35). Appendix : Vergil's Use of the Anthology Tradition There is cruel irony in Vergiťs use of literary precedents from the sepulchral epigram as well as from the epic tradition. We have many epigrams in the Greek Anthology which treat burial at sea, and there can be no doubt that consciously or unconsciously they influenced Vergil. According to Servius and Probus, Vergil did not himself end the Fifth Book where it now closes, but this was the decision of his friends Varius (34) The title of the Fordham talk which led to this article was Palinurus and the Epicurean Vergil. W. R. Johnson, Darkness Visible , esp. p. 142-144 and p. 150, asserts his belief in a Vergil profoundly influenced by the Lucretian vision of the world. At the Fordham meeting both Johnson and Gordon Williams stressed the Epicurean component in Vergil. H. Naumann, War Vergil Epikureer ?, in Sileno, 1 (1975), p. 245-257, following L. Alfonsi, L'epicureismo nella storia spirituale di Virgilio , in Epicurea In Memoriam Hectoris Bignone , M. Untersteiner, ed. Genoa, 1959, p. 167-178, taking a contrary view, seems to treat only the surface of Vergil. Alfonsi held that starting out with a materialistic Epicurean conception, Vergil moved to a "scientific ideal which was fideistic, with poetry offering a hope of peace ( ataraxia ) and immortality." (p. 178). (35) Thanks are due to Profs.

The termination of the book has more of an epigrammatic than epic feel to it : "O nimium caelo et pelago confise sereno, nudus in ignota, Palinure, iacebis barena." (5, 870-871) (Зб). One misses the pentameter in the final line, but it is suggested by the clear break at the pentameter caesura after nudus in ignota (37). Since, too, the name of the deceased normally falls in the hexameter verse, the position of the name contributes to the epigrammatic effect. Moreover, the lines, spoken by Aeneas, the friend and father-figure of the deceased, reflect one of the most prominent themes of the anthology - a shipwrecked body lying naked on a foreign strand ; and it is generally a friend or close relative who in the epigrams addresses the dead (38). Though the Sixth Book on both external and internal grounds seems to have been written - or better, completed earlier than the Fifth Book, Vergil's play on the literary precedents of the sepulchral epigrams in the Sixth Book is more subtle and complex. While the Fifth picked up only a few themes - nakedness, the foreign land, and the beach (lack of burial is implied), the Sixth takes up more themes and emphasizes the ideas of rest and burial. In the Anthology the lack of burial is the most prominent element, while the subsidiary themes of the aimlessly floating body and the empty tomb vividly underscore the tragedy. One should recall Ovid's Ceyx and Alcyone, where the distraught heroine, pleading with her husband not to sail over the deep evokes the dread sight of tombs which have "names but not body" : et saepe in tu mul is sine corpore nomina legi (Met ., И, 428). (36) The sentiment of 5, 870 does not seem to appear in the Greek Anthology or in W. Peek, Griechische Grabgedichte , Berlin, 1960 even though it would seem very natural. (37) Actually many of the Latin epigrams consist only of hexameters, and they tend to be short and simple. P. Waltz, Anthologie Grecque , IV, Paris, 1938, p. 27, comments that the most ancient funerary epigrams are brief and in hexameter, citing Preger, Inscr. Graec. Metr., xiv ; IGA , 466, 149 : IG 2, I, 466, 468. (38) E.g. AP , 7, 497 (Damagetos) : yuiivòç en' àÇeivou xeißEvog aiyiaXoù ; AP, 7, 286 (Antipater) : хешас Srj Çeivfl yufzvòç hri t¡lóvl ; AP, 7, 277 (Kallimachos) : ... evdáSe vexpòv í гире [L en' aiyialoiç, ... ; AP, 7, 501 : uoXuxXùgtco yußvov en' -qïôvi and AP, 7, 278 : OùSè véxuç, vaurjyòç èni xdóva Gfjpùç ¿Хааве1д xÙ[icloiv, àypîmvojv XŤ]aoixai j]Côvojv. Strangely in the epigrams given by W. Peek, Griechische Grabgedichte, Berlin, 1960, the sailors having in their career escaped death by drowning died on shore by a natural death (# 35, 145, 419). The first two are early (6th-5th and 3rd ВС). But Lattimore, 200, cites a late epigram from Erythrai (EG, 230, 1) where the empty tomb and body in the sea theme appears ( Themes in Greek and Latin Epitaphs, Urbana, 1942).</page><page sequence="23">798 F. E. BRENK Murder after escaping from the sea does not occur in the epigrams, but in one the survivor is killed by a wolf, in another by a serpent (39). The motif goes back to the Odyssey : on landing on the isle of the Phaiakians Odysseus is afraid that if he sleeps on the ground a wild animal might kill him. Thus the murderers of Palinurus can be seen as wild beasts, or, in a more general framework, men can be seen as more savage and cruel than the wild animals (40). The themes of the restless body and the name on the bodyless tomb receive more complex treatment in Vergil. He combined the epigramma- tic motif of the body floating restlessly in the sea, with the epic one of the soul seeking restlessly to obtain burial so it might cross the Styx (41). The heavily epigrammatic feel to Palinurus4 words can be seen in his expression sedibus ut saltem placidis in morte quiescam (6, 371) - where perhaps the sibilants are meant to express the sound of the body washing in the sea, compared with the Palatine Anthology 7, 278 : oùSè вауш Xeij] xèxXífjiaL rjavxiji- Palinurus4 body is actually floating in the sea - in the epigrams, more precisely, washing up against the shore : nunc me fluctus habet uersantque in litore uenti (6, 362) ; which is very similar to an actual epigram from Corcyra in the Roman period : хеЕцас S' èv IxzpW пара 6eïv' âXòç rj)j£fxóeGaav (EG , 186, 5-8) (42). The Vergilian presentation of the death of the steersman also strikes resonance in another thematic area of the Anthology tradition, the impossibility of the dead sailor's soul finding rest in its burial spot near its (39) AP, 7, 289 (Antipater of Macedonia). The shipwrecked Antheus swims to the mouth of the river Peneus, and is slain by a wolf. Antipater exclaims that the waves were less treacherous than the land. AP, 7, 290, the person is killed by a serpent "on the Libyan strand" after escaping from the sea. (40) Od ., 5, 473 : ... SeíScü nr¡ Otìpeoglv eXojp xai xùppa yÉvùjpcu. The word xvpßa seems popular in the epigrams, e.g. АР, 1 , 273 : xàyaj ßkv uóvtoj ScvEtjßEvog, ¿xOúdt xüpßa, осхщас • феиатщ 8' ouroç etzeotl XíOoç. There seems to be a close link between the Odyssean passage and this part of the Anthology. (41) Here again Vergil merges Homeric and Hellenistic themes and forms. As Waltz points out (A nthologie Grecque , IV, 29-31) the epigrams like to affect narrative, especially if the death is accidental or dramatic ; often the underworld is the place of the scene ; and they like to use direct address. There are 1 1 examples of the dead addressing a person, 6 where friends address someone, and 1 5 where a dialogue takes place between a dead man and another person. (42) Cited in R. Lattimore, Themes in Greek and Latin Epitaphs , Urbana, 1942, p. 200.</page><page sequence="24">VNUM PRO MULTIS CAPUT 199 enemy, the sea. Considering Palinurus1 constant fear of the sea while still alive, and the dangerous geographic perspective of the promontory in the wild coastline, with the necropolis on top, the theme of the shipwrecked shade unable to obtain rest near the sea contributes greatly to the general impression of the Palinurus scenes. In an epigram by Archias of Byzantion (AP , 7, 278), cited above for the line oùSè вауш Ыг] хЫщои r}wxífl, we the sentiment : Near the dreadful roar of the billows even among the dead in Hades I cannot get repose. The sentiment is not incidental, but repeated with variation in each distich. The Vergilian adaptation of sine corpore nomina is also a brilliant, even playful jeu d'esprit with the literary tradition, though with macabre overtones. In the epigram tradition the name on the tomb is a pessimistic incongruity reminding one of the body floating in the sea (43). The inverse is burial in a foreign land without a name for the tomb - anonimity and oblivion. Vergil brings these dichotomies into structural resolution, in which the more obvious optimistic meaning of the Sibyls words struggles against the pessimistic literary precedents. Palinurus receives the promise of an eternal name - though naturally the natives have no idea of his history, and in reality one feels that he has been created to explain the name. The somewhat ambiguous reaction of Palinurus to the Sibyl's words thus reflects the literary situation. A further Vergilian modification of the thematic content of the sepulchral epigrams is the burial of the bones. With his usual tendency to exploit in a complex way a number of literary traditions for a new situation, Vergil combines the theme of unburied bones and foreign burial, centered on ossa piabunt (6, 379). The theme of unburied bones is prominent in the Anthology , often combined with the added horror of a cadaver devoured by fish. In the epigrams the deceased may be buried either by a murderer driven by the desire to disguise his guilt, or by a kindly stranger. Vergil does not exclude the possibility that the murderers and the ones who performed the rites were the same (gens crudelis , 6, 359). There is a Lucretian touch to the description of the murderers who seem to be a substandard variety of the human race. They do not bury the (43) AP , 7, 271 (Kallimachos) : vüv 8' ó ßb eiv áXí пои угретой vkxuç, âvzi 8' exeívou ouvoßa xaì xeveòv afjßa ларерхоцева. AP , 7, 272 (Kallimachos) : ...

BRENK body to conceal the crime as in AP , 7, 310, but either themselves, or innocent people living in the region, act out of superstitious fear. The motif seems to be new with Vergil. By excluding the motif of human kindness as the explanation for the burial, Vergil again gives a very pessimistic tilt to the literary tradition. Thus gaudet cognomine terrae (6, 383) is a reversal of expectations. Quite remarkable in these lines is Vergiťs emphatic postioning of parumper : aeternumque locus Palinuri nomen habebit. his dictis curae emotae pulsusque parumper corde dolor tristi ; gaudet cognomine terrae (6, 381-383). Not the locality, but Palinurus "rejoices in the name" - a name which in the literary tradition evoked curae and dolor rather than the opposite. Finally it is possible that the epigram tradition explains a crux in this passage. Vergil begins by relating that Palinurus, the steersman was on a Libyco cursu : Ecce gubernator sese Palinurus agebat, qui Libyco nuper cursu, dum sidera seruat, exciderat puppi mediis effusus in undis (6, 337-339). The literary precedent and typology for much of the Palinurus incident is not epic at all, but the Anthology tradition of the shipwrecked sailor. If Notos formed a strong part of that tradition, our suspicions would be aroused, but even more so if the Libyco cursu formed a part of the epigram tradition. In an epigram by Leonidas of Tarentum С 4P, 7, 273), the location of the sailor's death is the "Libyan sea" (Лфихой ßkoca веш nEXâysvç). In both Vergil and the Leonidas epigram similar ideas of storm and darkness appear (xai vùÇ xai Svocpepfjç xvßara navSvaí-qç) as well as stars and the Libyan course. Much of this would be common to epic as well (44). In (44) A. S. F. Gow, D. L. Page, The Greek Anthology. Hellenistic Epigrams , II, Cambridge, 1965, p. 369 explain, following Strabo, 2, 122 ff., that Libykou meant from the western extremity of the Mediterranean as far as to Aigyption pélagos . In AP, 7, 290 (Flaccus), after escaping from the sea, the victim dies from a serpent bite on the Libyan strand after he falls asleep. Notos does not seem to appear in the extant epigrams. In Odysseus4 swim to the Phaiakians, Euros, Notos, and Zephyros attack him (5, 295) but in 12, after the shipwreck which destroys his companions, he is first driven on by Zephyros, then Notos drives him back to Charybdis. There is some verbal similarity : Notus ...II uexit me uiolentus aqua ; (6, 355-356) : rjXde 8' eni Nóroç (Lxa, cpèpojv щф ãkyea dußto, / Tiavvúxioç (pepoß-qv, äßa S' г}еХ1со âvcóvTi (12, 427-429). Notus is needed to bring Palinurus to Italy, but it also fits the idea of Libyco cursu.</page><page sequence="26">VNUM PRO MULTIS CAPUT 801 Leonidas it is Euros, not Notos, which brings the sailor down. Still Notos figures heavily in the shipwreck tradition, and Vergil, as an Italian, would probably be thinking in terms of the violent scirocco, the bringer of so many storms to Italy, and of the general framework of his epic in which Africa is a source of irrational and unpredictable evil. Thus the epigram tradition may have suggested Líby co cursu, even though the more obvious meaning of the phrase would be "on the voyage to Africa", not "on the voyage from Africa." Frederick E.
