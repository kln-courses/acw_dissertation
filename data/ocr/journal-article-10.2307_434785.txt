<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERMINAL: DRAMA AND DRAMATIC STRUCTURE MARTIN KANES OF THE many realist and naturalist novels adapted for the stage in France, no case is more interesting than that of Germinal.' In itself the play is of small interest, and has been deservedly relegated to the vast and desolate storage rooms of nineteenth-century melodrama. But its production raised great storms of controversy that strike the contemporary reader as curious indeed. Presented to the Commission d'examen (Censor's Office) in October, 1885, as the work of William Busnach, the play was banned because of its Socialist overtones and its appeal to civil disobedience.2 Its interdiction quickly became a cause celhbre, one of the most colorful battles of the Third Republic, in which Zola himself took an energetic part. For three years and through eight changes in government, the novelist used the press, the Chamber of Deputies, the influence of friends, and every other available weapon to force the government's hand. He eventually won his battle, but it was a bitter victory: the play was a commercial and artistic failure, running only from April 21 to May 6, 1888.3 One wonders at the fact that Zola took such interest in a play whose authorship he denied, or that he allowed the battle to hamper work on L'Oeuvre, La Terre, Le Reve and La Bete humaine. It was the only time he ever allowed a secondary effort to interfere with creative work in this fashion. The explanation will lead us straight to the origins of the novel Germinal itself: for the play was not written by William Busnach, nor was it an adaptation in the true sense of the word. There was but one Germinal project, and its origins go back to L'Assommoir, when Zola realized that the novel about Gervaise Lantier could not contain many social and political matters he wished to touch upon. Active work began in 1883-84. The first reference of any sort to a play on the theme of the mines appeared in the Gaulois for April 17, 1884, when the gossip-writer "Frimousse" announced that William Busnach, Zola's usual adapter, was to turn the forthcoming novel into a play. On that date, if he followed his usual pace of three pages a day, Zola had written only forty-five pages of the novel which he had commenced on April 2. He had barely finished the documentation, and indeed, there may well have been parts of it that were not done until later. The source of the press "leak" was Zola himself. Among the letters written by Busnach to the novelist, and now in the Bibliotheque Nationale, there is preserved the dramatist's pleased reaction to the information, which establishes that the whole idea was Zola's: "Vous savez que vous m'avez de vous-meme parle de la piece. Le sujet me plait infiniment. Avez-vous commence votre roman ?" 1 All references to Zola's work are to the Oeuvres complOtes, ed. Maurice Le Blond (Paris, 1927-29). The letters from William Busnach to Emile Zola are now catalogued in the Biblioth~que Nationale as Nouv. acq. fr. 24513, 24514 and 24515. Where the letter is undated, I have supplied the relevant manuscript and folio numbers assigned by the Biblioth~que Nationale. Since this article was written, Prof. E. M. Grant has published his Zola's "Germinal": A Critical and Historical Study (Leicester, 1962). Grant excluded from his study the question of the play; my observations here will therefore complement his excellent work. 2 In five acts and twelve tableaux, it presented the arrival of Etienne at the mines, the misery of the miners and their strike, the defeat of the miners, and their return to work. It also contained a musical comedy subplot developed from the miners' Ducasse. The censor's manuscript is now in the Archives Nationales, S6rie F18, No. 981. a When several of Zola's friends, Berthelot and Lockroy among them, reached positions of influence, the matter was settled on the basis of a few face-saving changes in the text of the play. Lockroy's role may have been somewhat less crucial than Le Blond indicates in his notes to Germinal (p. 552), since the censor had actually made a favorable report in October, 1887 (Busnach's letter of October 29, 1887). Casting and rehearsals were begun in December. All this took place before Lockroy entered the government in April, 1888. For details see Emile Zola, Lettres inedites d Henry Ceard, ed. Albert J. Salvan (Providence, R.I., 1959), pp. 131-35 and 153. [MODERN PHILOLOGY, August, 1963] 12</page><page sequence="2">"GERMINAL": DRAMA AND DRAMATIC STRUCTURE 13 (24513/506 verso). Zola evidently planned a play on the miners even before he had written the novel, considered the project sufficiently important to inspire a "leak" in the press and-as always when he was deeply involved-kept his work hidden from his friend Busnach. Not only was the play Zola's own idea, but it was later composed almost entirely by him. This again emerges from the correspondence, where one finds a letter from Busnach containing the following passage: "Une migraine abominable... Si je suis mieux, nous ecrirons ensemble les scenes de 2 h. a 4. si besoin est. Je pr6f"re cela de beaucoup t faire seul ce travail. Avec vous qui avez 6crit toute la piece, cela ira beaucoup mieux" (24515/271).4 The se- quence of events shows that Zola planned a play before the novel but wrote it after, so that the play represents a step in the creation of Germinal.5 An examination of the dossier should reveal the effect of this dramatic concept on the composition of the novel. At the beginning of the Ebauche (always the first document in the dossier), the dramatic tone is set: "Prendrai-je un patron qui personnifie en lui meme le capital, ce qui rendrait la lutte plus directe et peut-&amp;tre plus dramatique?" (fol. 402). The criterion by which Zola judged the various possibilities of his Ebauche was always one of directness and visual appeal. Although he conceived of the large mining company as a "dieu vivant et mangeant les ouvriers dans l'ombre" (fol. 403), an imaginative con- struction typical of the sort that appealed to him, he did not pursue the abstraction but turned instead to the creation of a dramatic mechanism by which this obscure struggle had to be rendered direct, visible, one might say "stageable": "La lutte visible reste par consequent entre les houilleurs et le directeur, avec son per- sonnel . . . Je montrerai le directeur chez lui ... dans sa maison, dans son jardin, j'opposerai son int6rieur a peindre (apres notes prises) ... un drame peut-etre, une fille s6duite, etc, de fagon "t dramatiser ce c6te de l'action et a obtenir un denoue- ment i la fin" (foll. 404-5). It is hardly necessary to underscore the visual ap- proach, the abundant stage terminology, which led him, in summing up this passage, to conceive of it as a unified action in a single decor, as a "tableau" in its strict nineteenth-century stage meaning: "Du reste, quelle que soit cette action, j'ai toujours le tableau de cette famille perdue au milieu de la r6volte ... Peur, drame, maison attaqu6e" (foll. 405-6). From this beginning, it is easy to follow the develop- ing visual techniques of the Ebauche; when, a few pages later, Zola tried to sum up his first thoughts, he enumerated not the chapters, nor what he later called the Parties of the novel, but the "scenes" of his story: "Une scene dans la mine, une scene dans un interieur d'ouvrier, une scene chez le directeur, une scene chez le patron.... La grave 6clate ... nouvelle scene chez le patron, nouvelle scene chez l'ouvrier" (foll. 412-13). It is significant to note that Zola enumerated "scenes" before he knew what they were to contain. This emphasizes a point which must be kept in mind when analyzing the documents pertaining to 4 The passage to which Busnach refers here was the musical interlude in the scene of the Ducasse. But even here, he wrote under the close supervision of Zola. The text of the play abounds in easily recognized Zolaisms ("la fatalit6 du travail," "te jeter encore dans cette abomination," "Tout ronflait"). More significantly, the scene of the Ducasse in the censor's manuscript is in a hand other than that of Zola's copyist, which may again indicate that the men divided work at this point. 6 In composing Germinal, Zola followed his consecrated system of sketches, planning, and documentation. The first document was, as usual, an Ebauche. That it preceded the Personnages and the Plans is shown by the fact that Chaval is called Antoine, and the Maheu family is called Durand. A very brief section at the end of the Ebauche (foil. 498-99) refers to Chaval and consequently postdates the Personnages and possibly much of the documentation. The Ebauche was followed by elaborate documentation, then by a 6-page Plan par parties of the plot and finally by two Plans. Upon completion of the Plans, Zola undertook the redaction of the text itself.</page><page sequence="3">14 MARTIN KANES Germinal: Zola had no clear idea of what he meant by "drame." There is here a subtle and perhaps even unconscious play on the word which Zola used freely in both literal and figurative senses. "Drame" meant, of course, visual perception, whence the constant use of stage terminology. But it also suggested violence, contention between opposing forces, crises, sharply delineated characterization. These con- cepts were implicit in his use of "scenes" and "tableaux," and remained, as we shall see, guiding principles in the whole Germinal project.6 This orientation is fundamental to the development of the plot, to which Zola turned after preliminary generalizations. In this sense "drame" was conflict, and Zola quite logically realized that "pour obtenir un gros effet, il faut que les oppositions soient nettes et poussees au summum de l'intensit6 possible" (fol. 420). The whole conception was for him a tissue of conflicting opposites: "le pauvre contre le riche, la faim contre la satiet6. Les hommes contre le repas du directeur, les femmes contre le luxe et la toilette de la directrice . ... Les deux maisons opposees, celle des Durant [Maheu] et celle du directeur" (fol. 422). It was quite natural, then, that when he came to sum up the main lines of the developing story, he should see it as divided into two distinct parts which again he called "tableaux": "Au debut, j'ai maintenant toute la famille Durant [Maheu] dans le puits de la grande mine . . . . Etienne peut loger chez les Durant .... Puis Catherine disparait . . . . La greve 6clate. Premier tableau" (foll. 437-38). Opposed to this was an entirely distinct level of narrative: "Maintenant, reste la partie superieure, les personnages bourgeois representant le capital. Ils doivent fatalement tenir une place assez grande. Mais je tacherai que leur drame soit le plus simple possible" (fol. 441). As starkly as possible, this primitive plot of Germinal sets bourgeois against worker, industry against indolence, Good against Evil. Nowhere does the shadowless light of the early Ebauche fall more crudely than on the emerging characters, who appear stiff, one-dimensional, and strangely akin to the consecrated protagonists of the boulevard stage. Most easily sketched in black and white configurations were the villains of the story, Chaval and Souvarine. In the first of these we find a typical boulevard traitor: "Je fais d'Antoine [Chaval] le traitre. La veille dans le bois, il a pu crier contre le patron, dire qu'il faut arreter le travail" (fol. 468). Charac- teristically, he is said to be obeying a "personnage enigmatique" and it is he who urges the miners on to violence and revolt: "Antoine pousserait a l'attaque, a l'arret du puits. Cela me donne un chef pour lancer le mouvement de la quatrieme partie, Antoine poussant puis se derobant et allant prevenir les gendarmes" (fol. 468). As a reward for his treason, Chaval is to be given the post of foreman, and the rest followed logically: "S'il liche Catherine dans ces conditions, c'est parce qu'il ne veut pas l'6pouser et qu'un porion ne peut vivre en collage. Voila donc tout Antoine trouv'" (fol. 469). Despite some brief misgivings on Zola's part, Chaval remained a classic traitor to the end of the Ebauche. It is not the tension of the situa- tion but his treason which, although described only indirectly, causes the violence: "je crois qu'il suffirait de le montrer, derriere les soldats" (fol. 476). If Chaval remained in the Ebauche a more or less conventional traitor, Sou- 6 An index to the dramatic terminology of the Ebauche would show the constant recurrence of the words "drame," "dramatique," "scene," "d6nouement," "action," "d6cor" and so forth. While it may be granted that individually they need not imply the idea of stage techniques, it must be admitted that collectively and in the context of what we know about the play Germinal, the suggestion of a work of dramatic art cannot be escaped.</page><page sequence="4">"GERMINAL": DRAMA AND DRAMATIC STRUCTURE 15 varine was a villain of another class altogether. He first appears in the Ebauche as a former friend of Etienne, but neverthe- less shrouded in mystery: "Un ami "a Etienne. Un nihilist, un petit russe, m6canicien, un russe refugi6, et les con- versations du soir" (fol. 417). Throughout the Ebauche Souvarine hovers in the background like a malevolent demon, object of only very brief references, for he was created with two simple aims in view: to represent anarchism in the spectrum of the novel's political symbols, and to sabotage the mine. The first was amply taken care of by the "conversations du soir"; the second was to constitute the denouement of the work: "On pourrait inventer tout un drame: l'ami d'Etienne, Nicolas, le nihiliste, celui qui veut faire tout sauter, peut a la fin de la greve aller preparer le puits, scier des douves, deplacer des planches, par un prodige de courage, de fagon a preparer l'accident" (fol. 434). The excessive simplification of Souvarine permitted some strange inconsistencies, especially his horror at discovering that Etienne is trapped in the sabotaged mine. Indeed, Zola pursued this theme to the point of Souvarine's suicidal self-sacrifice: "Quand a mon nihiliste.. . tout coule "a l'abime. Son ami est au fond, et il peut ^tre une des premieres victimes, se faire attacher pour aller reconnaitre, et y rester. Cela froidement . . Quand il descend: Mais c'est la mort-Je le sais" (fol. 489). We smile at such inexplicable motivation. Yet there is a certain consistency in the first portrait of Souvarine which arises not from his nihilist psychology, but from the necessities of a melodramatic crisis: "C'est la mort-Je le sais." The whole elementary sketch of Souvarine is designed to lead to this mot. Deeper levels of Zola's thought are reached in connection with Etienne, who had been destined for this novel ever since the writing of L'Assommoir. The particular importance which Zola attached to this character is underscored by the fact that he is the only member of the Rougon- Macquart family intended for multiple appearances in vital roles. He appears in this Ebauche on the Marchiennes road where "il rencontre mon mineur, qui le voyant accabl6 de fatigue, lui apprend qu'on cherche des rouleurs, des hercheurs" (fol. 449). But Etienne's most important trait, the one with which he had been labeled ever since the establishment of the family tree, was his homicidal tendency. This quality in Etienne presented no little difficulty, and Zola was at constant pains to retain it: "Ne pas oublier que j'ai fait d'Etienne dans la famille un maniaque de l'assassinat. II faut que je termine en indiquant cela. . . (I1 faut absolument qu'il agisse, et sur la famille du patron ou du directeur)" (fol. 417; Zola's italics). The frequency and strength of these reminders to himself indicate how hard Zola found the integration of homicide and political education, once he began to develop specific items of the plot. On folio 430 he decided to have "Etienne tuant l'inspecteur comme defense person- nel"; but three pages later he was un- certain: "D'autres ouvriers avec eux, l'inspecteur peut-&amp;tre, un duel (?)." By folio 448, Zola frankly admitted to himself that "Je n'ai pas encore m~16 mon Etienne a l'intrigue d'une fagon logique"; having evoked logic he soon found that the only solution was to reserve Etienne's criminal tendencies for later treatment: "Enfin il faut le faire sortir de la mine, encore plus r6volt6 qu'il n'y entre, le preparer pour le crime de mon roman sur les chemins de fer et surtout pour la Commune" (fol. 452). Actually, then, there is no "preparation" in the Ebauche. Etienne here is a crusading leader of men; he is selfless and generous; he loves Catherine but will not forcibly</page><page sequence="5">16 MARTIN KANES take her; he fights with Chaval for her sake but releases him after a beating; finally, his homicidal tendency remains extremely vague and uncertain except where Zola reminds himself not to forget it. It is easy enough to see why this happened. The principal interest of the Ebauche was a "drame social," not the person of Etienne himself; psychology-or even "analyse" as Zola liked to call it-had no place in a boulevard drama. Just as anonymous modern Capital had to be rendered visible in the person of the director, so the revolt of the miners had to be symbolized by Etienne. The workers' growing awareness of their desperate plight was to be expressed through Etienne's increasing political so- phistication; thus, "il doit rester sinon le centre, du moins le lien du livre" (fol. 480). The "linking" was his Socialist education; and this view of Etienne as the conscience of the miners remains constant through the Ebauche: "Donc il faut logiquement que la colere monte peu " peu en lui, et qu'a la fin il soit un ennemi irreconciliable du capital bourgeois" (fol. 480). It is quite consistent, then, that as a political symbol emptied of almost all psychological content, Etienne should share the political theme with two other quasi-anonymous figures: Souvarine, often referred to as "mon nihiliste," and Rasseneur, who is never named in the Ebauche but simply called "l'internationaliste." It is only because he was a Lantier that Etienne was graced with a name from the very beginning. At the end of the Ebauche, Zola considered the possibility of breaking down the hero's facile symbolism by condemning him to death: "A la rigueur, je puis ne pas faire envoyer Etienne. II resterait dans la mine" (fol. 494). The ease with which he con- templated this alternative indicates the extent to which Etienne had become a mere cog in a wheel, so easily disposed of despite long-standing plans for his future use. In the end, Zola decided to allow Etienne to survive Souvarine's sabotage-not neces- sarily because he would be needed for later novels, but because the social symbolism had become too important to be separated from the character: "11 travaille mais ne pas le faire tuer. Ne doit-il pas vivre pour representer l'6ternelle menace contre le capital, contre la societ6 ? Cela devient plus possible parce que cela entre dans un drame logique" (foll. 434-35). So Zola returned to the idea of a "logical," social drama in which Etienne would be the counterpoising element to the director Hennebeau.7 Just as the characterizations of the early Ebauche make constant concessions to a melodramatic premise, so does the plot. Ostensibly Germinal was to be a social drama, and yet political considera- tions were already hopelessly confused. Why should Etienne, the reasonable reformer, constitute "l'6ternelle menace"? On the other hand, why should Souvarine -the true menace-die ? Why is Catherine, designed as an innocent victim, not con- demned to death in the Ebauche? Might one not find here faint echoes of Zola's conversations with Busnach, who might well have pointed out that in a good play for popular consumption, the hero always wins, the villain is always punished, and the heroine always lives happily ever after ? For it should now be clear that in its first and most elementary form, Germinal appears as a typical boulevard melodrama, complete with an admirable hero, a pathetic heroine, a traitor, a villain (all reduced to stock symbols), a conflict of sensational violence in a striking decor 7 The same one-dimensional configurations can be observed in the other characters. Maheu is from the beginning the symbol of the upstanding worker, "l'ouvrier sage"; la Maheude represents the eternal feminine capacities for renewal and resourcefulness. Catherine is the symbol of passive, oppressed womanhood, and it is significant that in the third partie where she is to engage in some motivated action, Zola complained "Je ne la vois plus" (fol. 466). Despite her physical resilience and the brutishness of her life, Catherine as a pitiful victim has more than one sister among the vapor- ous heroines of Victorian melodrama.</page><page sequence="6">"GERMINAL": DRAMA AND DRAMATIC STRUCTURE 17 with Good and Evil clearly defined and possibly leading to a happy ending. Behind it all, one senses Zola's search for simple and contrasting motivations, un- complicated characterization, and clear action. These are the qualities of the Ebauche. Missing are all those obsessive motivations and living abstractions which have come to determine for us the power of Germinal. In several instances, Zola attempted to "situate" his characters by expressing mood and tone as a factor of milieu. He had two phrases which expressed these con- cepts in the Ebauche. One was "le dieu capital"; the other was "l'inconnu social." Normally Zola needed no more than a few such striking formulas to set him on the track of the peculiar anthropomorphic creations around which so much of the beauty of his novels tended to gather. Here, however, every time he attempted to evoke the poetic milieu in which his characters were to move and his action unfold, he found himself forced back upon the visual concept: "la grande mine reste alors le decor, le fond, le drame se passe dans la petite mine .... Mais il ne faut pas que la grande mine soit un simple d6cor, il faut qu'elle ait dans le plan une importance au moins 6gale et meme un peu plus grande que la petite mine" (foll. 410-11). What was this "greater import- ance"? Not once in the Ebauche was Zola able to express this concept. The best he could do was to reiterate his formulas, but nearly always linked to the concept of "logic": "Donc tout cela logique, partant de petits faits, de la misere et de la souffrance premieres, dont la cause est g6ndrale, remonte i l'inconnu social, au dieu capital, accroupi dans son temple, comme une bate grasse et repue" (foll. 422-23). Zola's insistence on "logic" indicates a trend of discursive thought that prevented the poetic mood, the "importance plus grande" from being expressed in the Ebauche. There was nothing particularly logical about the "dieu accroupi"-on the contrary. But a certain kind of logic-perilously close to outrageous coincidence as it may have come-does lie at the basis of a nineteenth- century boulevard scenario, and this is precisely what the Ebauche is. Zola's next step was the gathering of documentation, followed in turn by the redaction of the Plan par parties, Plan I, Plan II, and the final text. However, to complete the analysis of the melodra- matic elements in the composition of Germinal and show their role in the total process of creation, we must skip ahead several years and briefly discuss the play. The justification for this slight violence to chronology is that when Zola eventually came to write the play, he did not adapt from the novel at all; he merely went back to the Ebauche and wrote the melodrama he had originally sketched out there. In mood and atmosphere as well as in specific incidents, the play lies in close relationship to the Ebauche. It, rather than the novel, represents the literary fulfilment of that early document. We may pick up the characters we have analyzed in the Ebauche and show how the protagonists of the play are their lineal descendants. Souvarine is introduced in the first act by Bonnemort with many vague, mysterious references that reflect the quasi-anonymity of the Ebauche. As in the Ebauche, he turns out to be an old friend of Etienne's. Once he has taken his place in the political spectrum of the play, he remains quietly in the background until the moment of the sabotage arrives in the eighth tableau. He then slinks on and off stage brandishing a large axe which he proceeds to sharpen at the forge while Etienne and La Maheude discuss their return to work. In the ninth tableau, he</page><page sequence="7">18 MARTIN KANES commits suicide as had been contemplated in the Ebauche by walking into the col- lapsing mine before the horrified eyes of the onlookers. He does not even do it to rescue Etienne (Zola had apparently seen the inconsistency of such a deed); he does it simply because of the compelling force of a melodramatic formula that required Evil to be punished and all crises resolved by the flamboyant gestures so dearly beloved of the boulevard." Chaval also corresponds to the portrait in the Ebauche. His role as traitor is naively established in the sixth tableau where Etienne, Rasseneur, and Souvarine are discussing the impending arrival of Belgian strike-breakers. The scene is in Rasseneur's cafe; Chaval and Catherine enter: ETIENNE (bas aux autres): Plus un mot, n'est- ce pas? Cet homme qui est parmi les plus violents parmi les grevistes, a toujours des pieces blanches dans ses poches. RASSENEUR (bas): Un mouchard, tu crois ?9 In the seventh tableau, Chaval con- summates his traitorous action. Together with N6grel, he has woven a web of intrigue in which the miners will be trapped: HENNEBEAU: Quel est cet homme ? NEGREL: Cet ambitieux dont je vous ai parl6, ce mineur qui est avec nous. A few moments later, Chaval reveals the miners' secret rendezvous.Catherine, mean- while, has overheard Chaval's betrayal ("le miserable!"), and she emerges to warn the miners of their peril. But Chaval whips up the workers' taste for vengeance: "Qu'importe, la mort est pref6rable, et si le fort des forts h6site, je vous conduirai, moi, puisque notre chef a peur." The situation is thus principally Chaval's creation, and Etienne finds himself forced by his rival's maneuvering to lead the miners to certain bloodshed. In short order the miners return carrying with them the wounded Bonnemort, and the bodies of La Mouquette and Maheu. Etienne's final word in the scene underscores Chaval's role: "C'est ce Chaval qui nous a trahis ... je me souviendrai puisqu'une balle ne m'a pas fait la grace de me casser la tete." The Etienne of the play also shows a much closer connection to the ideas of the Ebauche than to the hero of the novel. He arrives on the scene if not as an experienced political fighter, at least aware of politics, and the play is essentially the story of his rise to leadership among the miners. The rise is rapid indeed; by the third tableau he has achieved sufficient stature to make a major speech, part of which Zola took from the very last pages of the novel: "h present, le mineur s'6veille au fond, germe dans la terre ainsi qu'une vraie graine; et l'on verra un matin ce qu'il poussera au milieu des champs! Oui, il poussera des hommes qui naitront pour la justice. C'est le beau printemps de la grande r6volution, c'est Germinal, comme ils disent, lorsque les bl6s grandissent." True to his role in the Ebauche, Etienne sways the miners by sheer eloquence and force of intellect. There is no tavern meeting and no Pluchart to help mold the temper of the men. All extraneous considerations have been removed from the single-line development of his character. His feelings for Catherine are reduced and dismissed by the evocation of a former love: "Et je l'aime pourtant! Ah! que n'ai-je donc le courage de chasser le souvenir de l'autre!" His ultimate failure in the strike is clearly not due to his incapacities, nor even to the force of circumstances, but simply to 8 In his anxiety to establish Souvarine as a thorough-going, cold-blooded villain, Zola also made him tell N6grel that he had no idea of what was going on when the mine collapsed. These scenes struck Busnach as being much too crude: "c'est horrible d'entendre Souvarine r6pondre qu'il n'en sait rien. Vous verrez que cela sautera a la plume. Cruaut6 inutile et dangereuse" (24513/546). 9Rasseneur had originally called Chaval "un agent provocateur," but this was changed to the more colorful term.</page><page sequence="8">"GERMINAL": DRAMA AND DRAMATIC STRUCTURE 19 Chaval's betrayal. Far from being some- what confused and upset by his failure, he retains excellent control of himself through- out. Above all, he is by no means an alcoholic monomaniac. Alcohol, as a matter of fact, is never mentioned. Telling Catherine of his dismissal from Lille, he does not attribute his attack on his fore- man to drink, but rather implies that it had its origin in a rationally considered situation: CATHERINE (stupdfaite): Menace ton chef! Est-ce possible! ... jamais ga n'arrive. ETIENNE: Si tout de meme. Mais dans les mines je vois qu'il faut de la patience.'0 In all these respects, as in many others, the play Germinal is the predictable development of the intentions of the Ebauche. Indeed, no better phrase could be found to describe it than the one Zola himself used, "un drame logique." The fact that naturalist aesthetics could have led to melodrama should be no cause for surprise. If tragedy, as Grierson has point- ed out, results from "what characters feel and think and in consequence do," from what evolves rather than from what happens, then surely melodrama is the reverse of this: a dramatic action based upon what happens rather than upon what develops.11 Indeed, naturalist aesthe- tics led all too easily to such a concept of the stage. Plot tends to move forward oblivious to characterization (here, e.g., the dismissal of Etienne's love for Cather- ine); characters are reduced to monolithic symbols; crises are brought on by some artificial device such as Chaval's betrayal or Souvarine's sabotage. And if dramatic emotion in a melodrama can be evoked only by the external sequence of events, then surely it was reasonable for such great emphasis to be placed upon staging the collapse of the mine, with the heighten- ing of horror for its own sake symbolized by the senseless suicide of Souvarine. Truly, one must agree with contemporary critics who labeled the play for what it was: a melodrama of the more blood-curdling sort. Had Zola implemented the Ebauche as it stood, he would have written a novel with the same plot, and more important, the same melodramatic qualities as the play. Given the somewhat uneven nature of his gifts, and the methodical manner in which each step of composition was based upon what had gone before, such a likelihood is not inconceivable. The prem- ises of the Ebauche could have led to noth- ing else. Yet they did not. Let us return now to Zola at the moment when he completed the 1bauche which implicitly contained the later melodrama. He was to complete the novel in four major steps: a six-page Plan par parties, a detailed Plan I followed by an even more elaborate Plan II, and finally the manuscript itself.12 Clearly, there was not very much adjust- ment to be made in the plot of the Ebauche; basically the "monstre," as he liked to call it, resembled the eventual novel. But the vast importance of these few alterations, operating in the context of a strongly established melodramatic trend, was one of the solid bases upon which the power of the novel rests. 10 Other less obvious factors link the play closely to the Ebauche. The extensive use of characters as symbols and the preoccupation with conflict which characterized the Ebauche is immediately apparent. M. Hennebeau, e.g., is made to function as the symbol of anonymous capitalism by the simple device of referring to him in the first tableau: ETIENNE: C'est d M. Hennebeau, la mine ? BONNEMORT: Non, il n'est que le directeur g6n6ral, on le paie comme nous. The parallel exchange in the novel contains no reference to M. Hennebeau; in the play his symbolic opposition to Etienne was necessary to the construction of a drama. This is further stressed in the second tableau, where Hennebeau himself, not N6grel, threatens the m;nzrs for their poor shoring operations. 11 H. Grierson, Criticism and Creation (London, 1949), p. 12. 12 The long process of documentation intervened between the Ebauche and the text, and it may quite possibly have sup- plied some poetic elements. This would not alter my point that these elements did not enter the process of composition until after Zola had completed the Ebauche.</page><page sequence="9">20 MARTIN KANES As he went through the steps of the redaction, Zola realized that his characters as sketched in the Ebauche would not do. They were too pat, perhaps too neat; one suspects that Etienne's "Socialist educa- tion," whatever its eventual value in a play, was rather too thin a motif around which to build a novel. Changes of significance began to appear in the succeeding docu- ments. The Plan par parties condemned Catherine to death, and it also eliminated Souvarine's flamboyant gesture of self- immolation. These changes at once altered the whole complexion of the work. The problem of Etienne was somewhat more difficult, but the de-emphasis of his poli- tical symbolism allowed the re-emergence of his more personal traits, especially his monomania. Plan I toys with the idea of his killing Chaval, an entirely new concept: "Si je laissais Chaval dans l'accident, je pourrai le faire tuer par Etienne, le [illegible word] il voit rouge, il le tuerait, avant ou apres la mort de Catherine. Avant" (fol. 356). But the act was far from decided upon, and the uncertainty reflects Zola's need to see more in his protagonists than mere stage puppets: "Etienne doit-il tuer Chaval la, ou meme a la fin? (Son besoin de meurtre satisfait, alors quoi dans 1'6tude sur les chemins de fer ?)" (Fol. 385). The monomania which was Etienne's original, fundamental trait once more emerges: "La tous les doutes d'Etienne sur sa physiologie (s'il n'a pas tu6). Et lui qui n'a pas tu6. Il s'en va pour ne pas tuer ("a voir)" (fol. 398). Not until Plan II, that is, at the very last moment, was the murder of Chaval decided upon: "Et faire revenir dans la tete d'Etienne l'id6e du meurtre. Son besoin de tuer. . . Predestination au meurtre" (fol. 371). The movement away from melodramatic premises had another much more striking result. Zola's interest in milieu (which in a play would be reduced to questions of d6cor) was now given free rein.13 In the actual redaction of the manuscript, the novel acquired a protagonist which the Ebauche and the play never had: the mine itself. The whole of the first Partie of the novel contains but two elements drawn from the Ebauche: Etienne's arrival at Marchiennes and a reference to the "Dieu capital." Both are reduced in the text to a bare minimum. Etienne's arrival is covered in the opening passage of some twenty-five lines of text, plus a few additional lines halfway through the chapter. When he meets Bonnemort, two more lines inform the reader that he is a machinist and is named Etienne Lantier. The "Dieu capital" is evoked only once, when Bonnemort, in response to Etienne's question, "designait dans l'ombre un point vague, un lieu ignore et recul6, peupl6 de ces gens, pour qui les Maheu tapaient a la veine depuis plus d'un siecle" (p. 18). The remainder of the chapter deals with other elements, principally the living qualities of the Voreux mine. At his first view of the mine, Etienne is "pris de crainte" (p. 10); in the darkness it seems like a malevolent beast: "de cette apparition fantastique, noyee de nuit et de fumee, une seule voix montait, la respiration grosse et longue d'un echap- pement de vapeur, qu'on ne voyait point" (p. 10). The rising dawn gives the Voreux "un air mauvais de bate goulue, accroupie la pour manger le monde" (p. 12). These were precisely the terms in which the Ebauche had described nineteenth-century French capitalism; the transfer of the ritual phrase gives a clue to the power of the new protagonist. By the end of the chapter the note of terror and the unknown has come to dominate completely the initial social drama which the Ebauche had proposed: 13 The d6cor of the play did indeed absorb much of his time and energy, especially the scene in which the collapse of the Voreux was staged. I have discussed the significance of d6cor in Zola's plays in my article "Zola and Busnach: The Temptation of the Stage," PMLA, LXXVII (March, 1962), 109-15.</page><page sequence="10">"GERMINAL": DRAMA AND DRAMATIC STRUCTURE 21 "Aucune aube ne blanchissait dans le ciel mort, les hauts fourneaux seuls flambaient, ainsi que les fours a coke, ensanglantant les t6nebres, sans en 6clairer l'inconnu. Et le Voreux au fond de son trou, avec son tassement de bete m&amp;chante, s'6crasait davantage, respirait d'une haleine plus grosse et plus longue, I'air gen6 par sa digestion penible de chair humaine" (pp. 18-19). Described time after time, from all points of view, the Voreux plays a role in the novel which is nowhere indicated in the Ebauche (with the sole exception of the remark that the mine must be "something more than mere d&amp;cor"). Forever lurking in the background, even when not actually evoked, its presence provides the "lien," the thread, which Etienne could not really furnish. One notes that whereas in the first descriptions of the mine it "seems" to have the qualities of a ravenous beast, by the end of the chapter the statements be- come direct, and the mine "is" a ravenous beast. In moving from the dramatic sketches of the Ebauche to the fully written novel, the poetic center of the work shifted from plot and characterization to mood and milieu. The mine displaced the miner.14 Once the new protagonist had been introduced, it began to grow and dominate the novel to an extraordinary degree. In the third chapter Etienne wanders about the buildings of the Voreux, waiting for Dansaert the chief foreman. Through his eyes, and through the speeches of several miners, the operation of the mine machin- ery is explained. But laid over this necessary introduction is a patina of evocative mate- rial. Etienne finds the buildings "pleins de trous noirs, inqui6tants avec la complica- tion de leurs salles et de leurs 6tages" (p. 31). Before him in the darkness he sees lamps-"deux yeux jaunes, 6normes, trou- erent les t6nebres" (p. 31). Confused by the dantesque activity, Etienne understands only one thing: "le puits avalait des hommes par bouch6es de vingt et de trente, et d'un coup de gosier si facile, qu'il semblait ne pas les sentir passer" (p. 33). Zola was able to find infinite varia- tions on the mood of the mine: "Pendant une demi-heure, le puits en d6vora de la sorte, d'une gueule plus ou moins glou- tonne... toujours affame, de boyaux geants capables de digerer un peuple. Cela s'emplissait, s'emplissait encore, et les tenebres restaient mortes, la cage montait du vide dans le meme silence vorace" (p. 34). When Etienne is finally hired and returns to the mine buildings in the company of the Maheu family, the mine once again appears to him as a threatening beast: "Les cages montaient, descendaient avec leur glissement de bete de nuit, engouffraient toujours des hommes, que la gueule du trou semblait boire" (p. 38). The emergence of the mine as one of the chief elements of the novel meant, of course, that the superficial melodramatic qualities of the work were disappearing. The very nature of the new protagonist precluded any such simple tale as had been foreseen by the Ebauche. As the mine supplanted the miner, as the original melo- dramatic struggle of the Ebauche became a more oppressive struggle of man against his fate, the milieu of the Voreux became the main narrative substance of the work. The suffocating presence of the Voreux confers upon the text its dense poetic texture, chiefly through the repetition of key descriptive expressions such as "masse lourde," "tas sombre," "fosse tass6e," "bate goulue, accroupie," the well-known "avaler" and the "respiration grosse et longue, soufflant sans relche, qui 6tait comme l'haleine engorg6e du monstre." These obsessive repetitions in Zola's prose 14 Whence much perplexity on the part of Busnach who did not find the melodramatic elements he was led to expect. He wrote, on February 25, 1885, that in the first feuilletons he could not find "'Tombre de I'ombre d'une piece."</page><page sequence="11">22 MARTIN KANES always indicate where the poetic center of gravity lies. Although they did not appear until the final moment of composition, the qualities of the mine became the single most important factor of the novel. This is an aspect of Zola's creative imagination which has not been sufficiently elucidated: the extent to which his com- position depended upon the elan of the very text he was composing. It would almost seem as if in putting aside his Ebauche, his documentation and his notes, Zola made a clean break with all that had been done; as if months of preparation notwithstanding, the creation of a text, of an "oeuvre," was an agony with which slices of life had little to do. In the Ebauche Zola groped for some larger significance in the idea of the mine, without being able to put his finger on it. Not until he actually began to write his text did the true meaning of his own vague phrase become clear. The "dieu vivant" crouching in his lair was converted from mere decor into a poetic metaphor. There is no evidence that Zola deliber- ately attempted to oppose the poetic weight of the new text to the dramatic elements of the Ebauche, yet this is essen- tially what happened.l5 The delicate juxtaposition can be identified most clearly by examining, finally, the manner in which the melodramatic premise affected the general structure of the novel. The problem was one of novelistic organization. Despite surface indications, the naturalist novel as Zola practiced it had no set formulas. The difficulty of putting together incidents, of fleshing them out with poetic substance, in short of creating a piece of prose that was recognizably a natu- ralist novel, was a new one with each work. In searching for the primitive form of Ger- minal-that of the Ebauche and the play- Zola kept circling about the idea of logic. We have seen that logic, in a melodrama, meant visual sequences, believable tab- leaux, simplified action, a series of events. In moving from the Ebauche to the text, the elementary logic of the melodrama became a matter of the organization of the novel into Parties and chapters. The very exis- tence of such a document as the Plan par parties testifies to his preoccupation with "logical" organization. This sheaf of papers consists of a series of highly condensed statements of the contents of each part of the novel. One page is devoted to each Partie, broken down into chapters which are in their turn broken down into their essential elements. The second chap- ter of the first Partie, for example, is headed "Chez mon mineur"; this general topic is then subdivided into: "Coron s'6veillant. Ceux qui se levent. Ceux qui restent. La maison. Toute la famille. Misbre, mecontentement. Poser d6jh ce que la femme doit aller faire aux courses a la 2e partie. Credit pos'" (fol. 1). The effect is like that of impressionist painting, with the major themes and actions broken down into their smallest possible constituent parts. The significance of the Plan par parties, from the point of view of composi- tion, is that the phraseology is nominal- hence static. It presents the novel as a series of synoptic spots, and so reflects and continues the visual preoccupations of the Ebauche. For Zola had by no means for- gotten his original, dramatic intentions. When he added a marginal note to the Plan par parties to indicate that the ob- stinacy of the miners was to be described indirectly in the fourth Partie, he wrote 15s After the first descriptions of the Voreux, it practically disappears from the text, leaving Etienne free to act out his role as the "thread" of the novel. We no longer read of the "bate qui avale" although it continues its daily routine. Etienne himself hardly glances at the forbidding buildings once he has grown used to them. Through the summer during which he develops his plans, the Voreux is not so much as mentioned, even though there reigns in its bowels an "6ternel hiver." At times it becomes a positively benevolent landscape, bathed in a "poussibre d'aurore" and with its escaping cloud of steam "toute rose" (p. 149). The moment the acts necessary to start the progress of the plot have been carried out, the Voreux reasserts itself characteristically in an accident which kills Chicot and nearly kills Jeanlin.</page><page sequence="12">"GERMINAL": DRAMA AND DRAMATIC STRUCTURE 23 "Pas en scene." And in Plan I and Plan II which came between the Plan par parties and the text, he was still telling himself that Etienne's fall from popu- larity was to be consummated in "une scene dramatis6e" (fol. 329); that there was to be "la grande scene dramatique entre Etienne et Chaval, devant Catherine" (fol. 299); that in the final accident he must "peindre l'6pouvante des bandes" (fol. 350); that the collapse of the mine was to be a "tableau 6pouvantable" (fol. 352); that he must not forget to resolve "le drame de Hennebeau et de Paul" (fol. 368). This is perhaps one of the most profound ways in which the dramatic intention influenced the conception of the novel: Zola consistently thought in synoptic spots which upon full development naturally became dramatic tableaux. The transfer of such an approach to the discursive texture of a novel meant that his typical chapter had to respond to two kinds of purposes, and that it therefore had to have two kinds of existence: one as part of a sequence of chapters in which themes and moods are carried forward from one to another; another as a visual semi-auto- nomous unit, as a "tableau." What Zola was groping for, then, in moving from the Ebauche to the text, was a way in which to preserve sharp, dramatic lines within the context of what can only be described as poetic evocation. He achieved this by the use of what one might call "ending techniques" designed to im- plement, at the level of the text itself, the synoptic spots of the Plan par chapitres.16 The most common of these was the use of a subsidiary theme which, by its counter- point, tended to show a fragmentation within the continuous line of the main action. In the fifth Partie, for example, we find a rising level of tension moving toward the inevitable clash with the army. It begins with the first direct description of the strike: the awakening of Deneulin early in the morning by the arrival of his foreman who announces the refusal of his miners to work, and rises to the damaging of the Jean-Bart mine, the wild rampaging of the mob through the countryside, the near-murder of C6cile, and finally the death and mutilation of Maigrat. That the ascending curve of action could not pos- sibly end here is obvious; the sixth Partie will continue it till the shooting by the army. But at the same time, this section has a distinct sense of completion in itself, a quality that is conferred upon it by the secondary theme of eating. Deneulin has difficulty in eating a hasty breakfast at the very opening of the section; Mme Henne- beau has invited his daughters and C6cile Gr6goire to lunch out (a near-fatal excursion when they stop to drink milk) and then to dinner at her house that eve- ning; the mob gradually picks up the cry "Du pain! du pain! du pain!" while the Hennebeau's cook laments the failure of the baker to deliver her vol-au-vent shells through the rioting crowd; Maigrat's store is attacked by the starving miners and then he himself is horribly mutilated by the women who remember his unspeakable bargaining over food supplies; finally the section is closed by a last view of the road cleared by the gendarmes, behind whom ar- rives the baker's boy, "qui se mit d'un air tranquille ia d6 ballerles crofites des vol-au- vent" (p. 386), thus ending Mme Henne- beau's anxiety and the theme of the "diner des bourgeois." Another device was the use of a striking character or incident at the beginning of a chapter or Partie, intro- duced merely to render possible its evocation at the end, thus inducing a kind of return movement. This technique can be seen in the sixth Partie where the essential 16 See R. Bayer, "Structure du drame," Recue d'esthetique, XIII (Janvier-Mars 1960), 3-12, for a theoretical discussion of the process of dramatic fragmentation.</page><page sequence="13">24 MARTIN KANES theme of increasing violence (Etienne's fight with Chaval, the murder of the soldier Jules, the clash with the army) is framed by the presence of the Abbe Ranvier. He had been introduced at the very beginning, a "pr6tre maigre aux yeux de braise rouge" (p. 391); he reappears briefly in the middle of the Partie when La Maheude is anx- iously awaiting Dr. Vanderhaghen as Alzire lies dying; and he appears again at the very end repeating his dire prediction of the beginning: "la prochaine exter- mination de la bourgeoisie par le feu du ciel, puisqu'elle mettait le comble ia ses crimes, en faisant massacrer les travailleurs et les desherites de ce monde" (p. 452). Again, the first Partie uses the landscape of the Marchiennes road, comparing what Etienne sees as he arrives in the night with what he sees in the afternoon light of the following day; it contrasts the gesture of Bonnemort ("il designait dans la nuit le village dont le jeune homme avait devine les toitures" p. 11), with the sight of the plain in the day ("Il s'6tonna, il ne s'&amp;tait pas figure l'horizon de la sorte, lorsque le vieux Bonnemort le lui avait indiqu6 du geste, au fond des tenebres" p. 77). Using a number of such techniques, all designed to emphasize the autonomy of the chapter, or its nature as a tableau, Zola fashioned his chapters and Parties, making them part of a larger whole, yet endow- ing each with a sense of completion, giving each a rise and fall of tension, and ending each on a note of finality where action ceases and decor changes.17 Such a method was much closer to dramatic than novel- istic organization. Zola did not pursue the implications of this method of composition, being a notoriously bad theoretician. But it underlay his whole approach to the novel in a far deeper manner than one would suppose at first glance. For the dramatic organization of Germinal was merely the most obvious instance of a tendency that went back to Zola's very first meditations on the novel form. As early as 1868-69, in his "Notes gen6rales sur la nature de l'oeuvre," he had foreseen his use of broad, powerful chapters based on a concept of "logic": "Ecrire le roman par larges chapitres logiquement construits; c'est-a-dire offrant par leur succession meme, une idle phases du livre." But at the same time, he wrote, "Chaque chapitre, chaque masse doit tre comme une force distincte qui pousse au denouement."18 And most significant, the complex "logic" of which he was writing was expressed even at this early date as a function of visual and dramatic structure: "Voir ainsi un sujet par quelques grands tableaux, quelques grands chapitres ... au lieu trop multiplier les scenes, en choisir un nombre restreint et les 6tudier ia fond et avec etendu."19 To a greater or lesser degree, this method underlies the construction of all of Zola's novels.20 As evidence of this continuing attitude, there is the regularity with which Zola drew up synoptic summar- ies for his novels with the almost inevitable result that a half-dozen were turned into plays. Unlike any other novel written by Zola, Germinal passed through a lengthy pre- liminary stage in which it acquired dra- 17 This is one of the principal "differences entre Balzac et moi" which Zola himself noticed. Where Balzac's chapters are short, tending to open and close in the middle of actions or even of conversations, Zola's chapters are never so, but can be removed from the novel and understood as self- contained sequences in much the same fashion as an act of a play. This fundamental difference accounts for Zola's diffi- culties with the feuilleton to which his massive chapters were ill-adapted. Another implication of this approach is the additional density it lent to Zola's already heavily charged prose. His long pages of uninterrupted narrative, his solid alignment of paragraph upon paragraph with almost no dialogue (although Germinal, because of the dramatic premise, is an exception in this respect), places his technique curiously closer to Proust's than to Balzac's. This is a question which would require much longer development than is possible here. 18 Quoted in H.

Anyone familiar with Zola's deep-seated obsessions with fire, dark, physical possession, death, love, and destruction, will appreciate how easily their juncture in Germinal might have made of the novel a haunted night- mare. All the more so, since these elements were not part of the planned conception of the work, but arose in the elan of com- position. "Cela s'6tablira en 6crivant," wrote Zola in the Ebauche, in a moment of clairvoyance. As it was, the two tend- encies, melodrama and poetry, odd though the juxtaposition may seem, serve to establish the delicate balance that makes Germinal the oppressive yet powerful novel that it is.
