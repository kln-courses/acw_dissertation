<plain_text><page sequence="1">69 AFRICA Margret Carey This talk had been planned to cover North, East and South Africa including Zambia. This area was just about all that was left over after Bill Fagg had pre-empted the art-producing areas of West Africa and the Congo Basin. As the new girl, I had to lump it. In Nottingham, I found that I was the only Africanist speaker present and so I rapidly re-drafted my talk to cover all Africa. Except for a very few titles, I have not expanded the bibliography. The trouble with Africa is its size and the diversity of its culture. 'Out of Africa comes always something new' and this seems to be the philosophy that causes the Museum of Mankind to bung almost anything unidentified into Africa. General Principles Don't be afraid to have a vague attribution like East/ South-East Africa or even Africa flUlf. Better a large pigeon-hole than the wrong one. Remember the former British Empire. This can mean for example that anything collected pre-1914 is more likely to have come from an adjoining British-held territory than Tanzania, Namibia or Cameroon. If the collector was known to have been a missionary, army man or in the colonial service, this can help in location. A lot of things come from battlefields. Stately homes tend to have sunbursts of weapons in the hall - the Museum of Mankind has some 78 Zulu assegais which must have been picked up after Ulundi and were later presented to the British Museum by Lady Bartle Frere, widow of the former Governor-General of Natal. Never ignore any possible clues like old labels which should always be kept. Even old auction numbers can help with an attribution if you can trace the catalogue or you know something about the dealer - if nothing else it can give evidence of age and maybe authenticity. Materials may help - ostrich egg-shell does not occur in West Africa or the Congo Basin, for example. Smell can be useful - tobacco, rancid butter, honey, can all indicate the purpose or even location of an object. Remember things move around as trade items or diplomatic gifts. For example, a Masai spearhead, collected among the Bemba of Zambia, was used embedded in a log for killing elephants. 'Airport art' can be fairly easy to recognise and even locate.</page><page sequence="2">70 There is an escalating trade in 'reproduction1 African art, some excellent, some grotesque. If a carving is earlier than about 1920, it is probably all right, otherwise one may have to be careful. I do not plan to discuss African art as such. For identification, Elsy Leuzinger's two books are as good as any. What follows is in note form - it was padded out ad lib in Notting- ham, and in probably quite different order. Metals Gold; mainly from former Gold Coast region, now Ghana, and Ivory Coast (Asante and Baule) . Rings, disc ornaments, gold-embellished standards, umbrella tops, etc. Large earrings fromWolof, Gambia. Silver: mostly as jewellery, N. Africa, Swahili coast. Silver-ornamented shields from Ethiopia, little pendants on Ethiopian baskets. Copper: connect with Katanga region of Zaire and adjacent areas. Currency ('Katanga crosses1), copper strip on spear shafts, copper spearheads and axe blades for chiefs in Zaire (e.g. Mangbetu) and Zambia. Copper and copper goods in trade. Bronze and brass: Benin bronzes, Asante goldweights, gracile genre figures from Abomey. All cast by the lost-wax process. Large disc anklets, Ibo, Nigeria. Wire leg, arm, neck ornaments, often from telegraph wire. Wire-drawing over much of East and Central Africa. Fine plaited-wire ornament on axe handles etc., from Shona of Zimbabwe. Stools from Kamba, Kenya with inlaid coiled-wire ornament on surface, three circular legs. Iron: just about everywhere. Iron-smelting less common than iron-forging. Bowl-bellows in W. Africa and the Congo Basin area, skin bag-bellows in S. &amp; E. Africa and Zambia, perhaps because fewer suitable large trees? Weapons When elaborate, ceremonial, or emblems of royalty or office. With spears and arrows, often diagnostic if heads tanged or socketed. Spears of Masai distinctive - long iron blade, short wood handgrip, long iron spike counterpoise. Very long spears, up to 8 feet + - Sudan. Etched sword-blades, S. Sahara, Sudan. Heart-shaped iron standards with etched Arabic writing - Dervish, Sudan. Bone arrowheads, sometimes bone fore- shafts - Bushman; small arrows, leaf flights - Pygmies; small bows for</page><page sequence="3">71 both. Cross-bows - Gabon. Throwing-knives in a band roughly from Sudan to S. Sahara and south-west into Gabon. Textiles - see Picton &amp; Mack. Barkcloth and Bark; If white, likely to be Ghana, otherwise a sort of tobacco brown, thicker than Oceanic since made of Ficus sp. rather than paper mulberry. Rarely larger than 6 feet across. Black on brown geo- metric ornament - Uganda. Raphia embroidery - Zambia, also used in masks in W. Zambia and Angola (Tshokwe) . Circular bark boxes, said to be derived from European hat-boxes, more or less along line of Arab trade route from Swahili coast to Tetela country in Zaire, especially in S. Tanzania and N. Zambia. Anthropomorphic bark boxes with wooden heads and feet, Mangbetu, Zaire. Matting: Narrow strips (c. lj in.) in N. Africa and Swahili areas, sewn together to make carrying bags, mats. Swahili mats distinctively poly- chrome, rectangular, finely made. Similar technique, broader strips, Luangwa valley, Zambia. Tent covers in Horn of Africa. All these made of split and plaited palm leaf. N. Zambia has split cane joined by transverse invisible stitching. Congo Basin area and its peripheries (around L. Victoria, W. Zambia) matting of split cane or palm leaf in natural and black, used for house partitions and walls as well as floor covering. Shields made in matting technique, or of wood faced with matting in the same areas. Basketry: Coil-sewn the commonest technique. Very fine, black and natural colours, around L. Victoria, often with conical lids. Closely sewn, light brown, leather or leather and cowrie trim, wooden top with stopper, often chip-carved, Horn of Africa, typically Somali. Often waterproofed by inner blackish coating which is dried milk, smoked (smell!). Similar, without wooden top, more cowries, Sahara. Poly- chrome coil-sewn dishes in Sudan, Horn of Africa, E. Africa, S. Sahara, N. Nigeria - sometimes food covers doubling as dishes. If colours include acid green and purple, think of Ethiopia. Pottery: Maybe wheel-turned in N. Africa, otherwise in N. Africa and Swahili coast turntable used; rest of Africa, by hand. No glaze except in Egypt. Alger ian pottery varnished, polychrome, black and coral on white or cream ground. L. Victoria area, metallic burnished black (plumbago), often in gourd-like shapes. Two-tone red and cream from the Shona of Zimbabwe, Lozi of Zambia. Low-temperature firing - c. 900 C</page><page sequence="4">72 as against 1200 -1500 C, the paste tends to be coarse and include pounded potsherds, chopped grass, etc. Slightly porous, the surface enhanced and sealed by pebble-burnishing. Other decoration - rouletting with carved or plaited fibre roulettes, combing, incised pattern, raised surfaces, slips, splashing with bark infusions while still red hot from the firing. Representational pottery pipe bowls - large and elaborate from Cameroon, usually black; smaller, red with white fill in the lines, Asante, Ghana; reddish-brown or black, often an antelope's forequarters , Zambia. These tend to be roughly modelled and more finely carved when the clay is leather hard. Small red pipe bowls from Morocco and Algeria for hemp; larger red ones with flaring base, Egypt and Middle East including Turkey. Water-pipes for hemp-smoking, usually a gourd with a short reed stem and a clay, pottery or soapstone bowl - in Zaire, Zambia, S. Africa. Similar, but with long stick, small gourd, Sudan. Soapstone pipe bowls, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Multi-bowl tobacco pipes, usually wood, often with white metal inlay, Bantu, S. Africa. Gourds: In most places. Carved, or carved and painted, Yoruba, Nigeria; covered all over with strung beads, Yoruba or Cameroon; in S. Africa, smaller gourds covered all over with beads strung or in open pattern; in E. Africa gourds with beads and cowries on leather strips; S. Sahara, gourds can be wholly covered in cowries. Incised ornament: Zaire, W. Africa, E. Africa, the Horn. Pokerwork, Nigeria, esp. N. Nigeria, often with red colouring. Skins and Hide: Horn of Africa for circular shields: small «- Eritrea; larger, c. 15-18 in. - Somali; larger, velvet and silver trim, Ethiopia. Other hide shields: large, pale, with black central motif - Tuareg; painted, oval, bound edge - Masai; oval, ox-hide with stick up centre back - Zulu and other Ngoni peoples. Little tanning except in N. Africa and Sahara (morocco type), brownish with black or cream, or red, acid green, cream and black. E. and S. African skins generally treated with fat and red ochre, whole skins worn as clothing, the legs used as ties. Sometimes fine bead ornament, e.g. Iraqw, Tanzania, Sotho and other S. African peoples who also use brass or white shirt buttons. Bushman skins very soft, greyish brown. 'Tanduf - use of inner skin when raw and sticky to make small bottles for snuff or antimony, often with strips of skin with the hair on; also little animals similarly made - Hausa. fMud and bloodf snuffboxes in shape of small gourd or an ox - Zulu. Similar technique used to make</page><page sequence="5">73 large flasks, c. 12-15 in. in India, called 'camel bottles'. Elaborately plaited camel- trapp ings with tassels and bells - Sudan and Sahara. If leather is brown rather than naturally darkened by the light, and morocco-type tanned it is more likely to be S· and W. Sahara, while the Sudanese leatherwork is less shiny. This sort of thing could go on and on. At the end of the day I can think of no good substitute for the handling of numerous specimens. In my first year at the British Museum I was put on to cataloguing a seven- year backlog of African accessions, and did about 4000 with little sketches! Also I helped to sort out the material evacuated during World War II on its return and later the Wellcome collection.
