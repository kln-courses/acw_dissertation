This completely redesigned permanent exhibition, which opened in 1989 and is titled Change and Continuity , surveys the interactions of Native Americans with outsiders, noting how many aspects of Indian life were affected by contact with Europeans, as well as the influences of native populations on the col- onists. The exhibition's approach emphasizes the malleability of cul- tures and regards peace pipes and tomahawks as examples of tradi- tional forms that were adapted to suit a changing world rather than simply as artifacts produced by ex- otic peoples. This focus on the interactions be- tween the cultures is an idea that took shape as political and social changes in the 60s affected both an- thropology and the museum world. The effects of European culture on native lifeways has become a fairly popular theme in temporary museum exhibitions, but according to Ian Brown, curator of the Peabody in- stallation, this is the first perma- nent exhibition to keep the theme before the public. It is also splendid to look at. At the entrance to the exhibition, a large copy of an 1832 painting by George Catlin- "Wi-jun-jon (also known as Pigeon's Egg Head or The Light) Going to and Returning from Washington"- announces what's to come. Wi-jun-jon went to Wash- ington wearing buckskin shirt and breeches and a feather headdress, but he returned in a frock coat with gold epaulets, sporting a top hat and gloves, a fan and umbrella, his .pockets full of whiskey bottles. Not all contacts produced such dramatic changes, but some were far more drastic. Native populations were decimated by disease and killed off by hostile Europeans. That Indians had an almost equally profound effect on the colonists is less well known. One scholar has argued that the experience of a common enemy 60 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="3">A Kwakiutl raven mask opens up to reveal an anthropomorphic face with a hooked beak.

The mix of continuity and change as cultures met head-on resulted in innovations that are highlighted in the exhibition. Among these are tomahawks (unknown before the colonists introduced metal), elabor- ate ornaments for horses, an animal new to Native Americans, saddle throws woven by Navajo women for their future husbands once horses became essential, and beautiful coats of commercial cloth for Indi- ans whose supply of hides dwindled after guns were introduced. Also displayed are beaded christening caps, clearly the work of Christian- ized Indians. Change and Continuity is a small exhi- bition, about 600 objects of astonish- ing design and craft selected from the museum's collection of some 23,000 artifacts. There's a green and pink Seminole turban, ringed by a circlet of beads and topped with a jaunty egret plume. There's a roach (headpiece), probably Cheyenne, of purple-dyed moose hair, trimmed with a porcupine quillwork pen- dant, feather-tufted streamers, and the dyed hair of a horse's tail, that makes the brilliantly dyed Mohawk haircuts of rebellious youth today look tame. A Southwest Alaskan Eskimo mask in the exhibition is so burdened with invention it fairly puts the Surrealists to shame. The lower part represents a walrus, its mouth stained with blood. Two arches form the eyebrows and face; close inspec- tion reveals the arches to be seal effigies. The mask's eyes are covered by goggles, for this cluttered, writh- ing face is an evil spirit in disguise, a spirit capable of shuttling between the spiritual and material worlds and looking into both. Atop its head five hunters sally forth in individual kayaks. For visitors with the time to read, there is much to be learned. The exhibition is divided into cultured areas, and preceding each one is a time line. Although the background colors can make these hard to read, they rattle off a succession of little- known facts: "1650 - Funds solic- ited by President Dunster to erect a building at Harvard College for Indian students . . . 1868 - Indians are denied the right to vote as a re- sult of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . 1868- The Commission of Indian Affairs estimates that Indian wars in the West cost the government one million dollars for each Indian killed . . . 1987 - Sam Eastman's paint- ing of an Indian scalping a white man is removed from the House of Representatives Committee Room.

Large wall plaques in each area home in on intercultural effects: In the Northeast, once the fur-bearing animal population declined from over-exploitation, the Indians turned to trading quillwork boxes and wood- splint baskets, no longer made for their own use but only for tourists. In southern California the Spanish had absorbed or culturally destroyed many Indians (and killed others) in an attempt to save their souls. In northern California the Yurok, Hupa, and Karok remained largely undisturbed, and their cultures stayed intact; little was exploitable but land and timber, so the settlers generally ignored the natives. Dioramas displayed at the Pea- body earlier this century are reused in the present exhibition to illustrate how perceptions of Indian life have changed. In one particularly telling display, an old diorama of Seminóles entirely free of European influence, wearing native dress and using na- tive pottery, is juxtaposed with a photograph taken around the same time that shows the Seminóles in garments cut from European cloth and surrounded by metal pots of Eu- ropean manufacture. The anthro- pologists who created the diorama clearly preferred their own notions of ethnographic purity to the cross- cultural influences that had already affected Indian life. The Peabody Museum, established in 1866, was the first anthropological museum in America and probably the first in the world. It contains some rare objects and collections of the sev- enteenth century and archaeological finds of the eighteenth century. The Peabody has important artifacts from each of the cultural areas in every part of the continent, from Florida to the Arctic and from Maine to California. According to Ian Brown, no other museum, not even the few with so wide a range, has attempted to pre- sent such a complete overview of cul- tural interactions in one exhibition. The Northwest cannot be prop- erly studied without viewing the Peabody collection. It is here among the Haida and Tlingit and Kwakiutl that the exhibition ends, between towering house posts with wide-eyed figures sitting on beasts, and masks of preternatural vigor. Between these brooding presences sits a startling image of transformation: a Kwakiutl raven mask that opens to reveal yet another mask within, the open wings surrounding it like the rays of the sun. The Peabody went to great lengths to prevent Change and Continuity from becoming yet another one-sided view of Native American cultures. The planning and opening of the exhibi- tion itself provided opportunities for cultural interaction. Five Native Americans were among the consul- tants to the project. Several days be- fore the hall opened, two religious men, one the Commissioner of In- dian Affairs for Massachusetts, spent the better part of a day blessing the displays with burning sage-grass and appropriate rituals. An effort to at- tract local Native Americans to the opening, however, failed; many did not attend for lack of formal attire. A second, less formal opening coincided with a conference of female Indian chiefs in Boston, which measurably raised Native American attendance. Those who travel to Harvard Square today have plenty of visual pleasure in store and perhaps a new way to regard Native American cultures. ■ Vicki Goldberg has written on art and photography far a variety of maga- zines.

A Collection Goes Home More than a century ago the Peabody Museum acquired the Sacred Pole, the central and most holy object of the Omaha Nation, regarded as the symbolic center of their existence. It was due to be buried with Yellow Smoke, its last keeper. But in 1888 Alice Fletcher, an anthropologist on the Peabody^ staff, and an Indian named Fran- cis La Flesche convinced bellow Smoke to transfer the pole and a number of sacred objects to the museum. The Omaha Nation sur- vived, and in 1988 representatives came to honor the pole for the first time in a hundred years and to request the return of the sacred objects. Harvard University did not rush to comply. It was quite pos- sible that the artifacts were still in existence only because the museum had preserved them. The records, carefully sifted, in- dicated that the artifacts origi- nally might have been acquired by loan, which meant that their return would not set a precedent for the return of other collections. It was decided that the sacred and secular objects would be given back, in order to forestall any claims that sacred objects should automatically revert to a tribe. The museum photographed each item and prepared extensive conservation reports to ensure that future scholars would have some- thing to study. Ian Brown says that the Peabody also wanted to be cer- tain that the collection would be properly maintained and available for both public view and tribal reverence. When the Omaha indi- cated they wanted to build their own museum, the Peabody ar- ranged for the returned collection to be stored at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln until the mu- seum was built; in the interim, the objects remain available at the university for viewing and for cere- monial use by the Omaha.- V.G.
