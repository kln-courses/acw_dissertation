University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles 1986. $65.00. Islam has played an important role in the history of West Africa over the last thousand years. In fact, West Africa is one of the areas of the world in which Islam has been extremely successful. Yet the material aspects of its presence, with only a few exceptions, have been virtually ignored by Islamicists and Africanists alike. Haiumere: Islamic Design in West Africa is a very welcome addition to a sparse literature. It is the first study that attempts a "global" survey of the role of Islam in the arts and architecture of West Africa—a survey that lays the foundation for the presentation of a number of provocative theories. The title of the book, Haiumere, as Prussin explains it, is derived "from the Arabic term khatem or seal, used in reference to the amulets written in the form of squares and applied to a range of behavioral situations and contexts in North Africa. The Fulbe term haiumere ... has developed into a generic reference to many aspects of self-conscious design in the West African environment." The book is divided into two parts, one dealing with spatial and the other with temporal aspects of the man-built environment in West Africa. The first attempts to place a variety of material traditions in three basic contexts—physical, behavioral, and conceptual. Its introductory chapter includes an interesting survey of early European accounts of architecture in West Africa as well as an informative discussion of architectural his toriography. The second part explores the historical development of four architectural traditions—the urban architecture of medieval West African empires (Ghana, Mali, and Songhay), the architecture of the Islamized Mande and Islamized Fulbe peoples, and finally the architecture of the Islamic-influenced (but non-Islamic) Akan. Haiumere provides a good overview of previous studies of West African material culture. Prussin successfully draws upon a large body of diverse sources—European travel accounts, translated Arabic chronicles, the an thropological and archa;ological literature, as well as her own field research in Ghana, Mali and Guinea—to formulate her historical reconstructions. She offers a number of provocative theories pertaining to "Islamic" archi tecture in West Africa. For instance, she perceives a dichotomy between "sedentarism and male ownership" and "transhumance and female owner ship." Another set of ideas concerns the evolution of the man-built envi ronment in West Africa (under the influence of Islam) from an indigenous (African) subjective space associated with anthropomorphic imagery to an Islamic objective space associated with geomorphic imagery. MESA Bulletin 21 1987</page><page sequence="2">Humanities and Research Tools The book represents the culmination of nearly twenty years of research and writing about the architectural traditions of West Africa. Those famil iar with Prussin's previous work will find in reading Hatumere many of the ideas she has presented in numerous articles and essays written during the last ten years. It is nice to see these thoughts brought together under a single cover. The text is profusely illustrated with black-and-white and color pho tographs as well as line drawings of architectural plans. Noticeably lacking are photographs of interior spaces. The reproduction quality of the pho tographs is mediocre (due primarily to the color of the paper on which the book is printed). The book is a sumptuous production—large format (8 1/2x11 in.), rich cream-colored paper, color photographs. At $65, Ha tumere is a book that only libraries and a handful of specialists will buy. This is regrettable, for it would have made an excellent textbook for an architecture or art history course. Nevertheless, it is still a book highly recommended for those interested in the material, historical, and concep tual aspects of Islam's presence in West Africa. There is little doubt that Hatumere will stimulate debate for many years. Raymond A. Silverman University of California, Santa Cruz</page></plain_text>
