Preface : Who are the aZandé ? Geopolitical ly, the aZandé have about two generations ago emer- ged from the stage of a well-organized nomadism on open or gallery- forested savannah lands. And they may not inaccurately be classed as a dominating, if not an 'imperial', ethnic group. Perhaps akin to the Fulani (Peuhl) and coming more recently from a direction east-south-east of Lake Chad, within the last generation the aZandé, under the Vongara family, have moved south and given their language and organization, on terms of full equality, to a confederation of at least thirteen peoples. Today the paZandé language predominates from the 23 to the 30° long. E. and from the 6 to the 3° lat. N. And Zande speech is understood from the 1 Z anclé is the singular and aZandé the plural form.

Into the Great Forest they seem to have had no desire to penetrate beyond the limits necessary to procure the oily-red zali- powder for their magic remedies or their divination. Linguistically, paZandé is of the Western Sudanic, and not of the Nilotic, group of tongues. In the Zandé lingua franca of the Eastern Sudan- section of this confederation, the two general terms used to describe a European, as opposed to an Egyptian or African, still remains alternatively bolomo or turku. The term Turk naturally has a particular application to a European of the officer or governing classes. Ethnically, the aZandé are negroid 'red-men'. Their country represents t the half-way house situate between the Semitic-speaking Moslem Arab and the baNtu-speaking Animist Black. Geographically, the Zandeised group of peoples are widely spread in the French, Belgian and Anglo-Egyptian zones of Africa. The observer speaks the Zande language, and these anthropological observations have extended to each of all three of these ethnically-arbitrary divisions. It may in passing be noted that it is only in the ex-Turko-Egyptian Sudan that the nickname of 'Niam-niam' was applied to the aZandé by their more backward Black Negro neighbours. Demographically, the group is estimated (by the missionary Père van den Plas in 1918) as "between three and four millions". From their lofty outlook among the resonant rocks of the bare outcrops of the western Congo-Nile Divide, Elders of the now assimilated peoples, such as the (baNtu) baPambiya, can still point out the trails between the tributary rivers where they witnessed, from the high caves, the first waves of the aZandé columns streaming over from the north Congo watershed into that of the Nile. This was the great tide of the aZandé sweeping down towards the more fertile lands of the South. Among their armament or weapons, then a 'secret weapon' novel to the southern peoples, were the swooping bird-like Casting -Javelin, as well as the flat and deadly little sharp iron trumbash, which is a kind of boomerang. The need, and therefore the use, of these two weapons is now already dying out. They are the only living people known to me who possess the courage and the skill to measure themselves against the elephant, outside forests and on foot, armed only with a lance. These records have been made by quiet and direct observation - by watching without seeming to be interested, and by overhearing prayer and conversations - of Animist aZandé speaking no language but their own. No system of direct enquiry or questioning was used. No interpreter was employed. To build up a record by such a method is a very slow and gradual process. It does not always produce such a pleasantly coherent picture. But this passive participation in a people's life presents certain advantages in that these are the results of patient, unobtrusive observation of spontaneous actions, seen and heard in their own natural setting.</page><page sequence="3">An African Culture of Today. 195 Explorer's Record of the aZandé. Dr. George Schweinfurth, the careful German explorer, writing in 1873 has recorded his impressions of the aZandé. "I have seen (he says) the wild Bishareen and other Bedouins of the Nubian deserts. I have gazed with admiration upon the stately war-dress of the Abyssinians. I have been rivetted with surprise at the supple forms of the mounted Baggara. But nowhere, in any part of Africa, have I ever come across a people that in every attitude and every notion exhibited so thorough a mastery over all the circumstances of war or of the chase as these 'Niam-niam'. Other nations in comparison seemed to me to fall short in the perfect ease - I might almost say, in the dramatic grace - that characterised their every movement. Historical record of the aZandé. A thousand miles south of Khartoum, Rejaf, the terminal port of Nile navigation and occupied by a Dervish army, fell into the hands of Colonel Chaltin, coming from the west, in 1897. On the 17th February 1897 at the decisive battle of Rejaf, the decisive factor in the victory of the nordic Europeans, over the fanatical and slave-raiding armies of the Semitic and Messianic Mahdi, was gallantly admitted by Colonel Chaltin to have been his conscripted Zandé contingent under the aVongara, Bafuka and Renzi, their feudal chiefs. These men were warriors, not soldiers. They were untrained in European methods of warfare. They were un- mounted. They were unequipped with firearms. They had no reason to love Europeans. "La fusillade Mahdiste pleuvait depuis quelque temps, et nos hommes ne bron- chaient pas, quand Chaltin constata que l'ennemi ébauchait un mouvement de flanc sur sa gauche. . . Il est huit heures. La fusillade dure toujours et le mouvement tournant des Mahdistes s'accentue. . . De notre côté, Sarolea vient de tomber. . . Peu avant de faire sonner la charge, Chaltin avait envoyé à gauche, à l'extrémité de sa ligne, les 580 lanciers de Renzi et de Bafuka qui arrivaient à temps ; car Becker était sur le point d'être tourné. Les aZandé bondissent, franchissent la rivière, tournent l'ennemi, jouent du couteau et de la lance. Ils font un massacre de derviches. Le résultat ne se fait pas attendre. L'aile droite des Mahdistes est bousculée et se disloque . . . L'ennemi, délogé des rochers, s'enfuit en débandade vers le nord, vers le Nil, vers Rejaf, abandonnant armes, drapeaux 2 et munitions, et l'on se met à sa poursuite." (Rejaf et son histoire. By L. Lotar. Published in 1932.) The author was an eye-witness of the battle. This short prefatory note will serve to show some of the salient features of the African people to whose religion these notes refer. Foreword and Framework. In order to form a frame in which to present, in proper perspective, an outline of this spiritual cult, it is necessary first to create for it its proper background. For this purpose, there are certain preliminary questions which must inevitably arise. And they must first be answered as clearly as may be. The aZande, are they Totem-ists ? Yes, but among the aZandé there is no visible tendency for the clan- totems or the tribal spirits to transform themselves into local gods or, by the most facile of human conceits, to be portrayed in the outward form of man. Among the aZandé, anthropo-morphism of the Spirit would arouse a feeling corresponding almost to what in Europe would pass for blasphemy. 2 The Mahdist flags are to be seen in the Musée de l'Armée, Bruxelles.</page><page sequence="4">19G Tracy Philipps, [41-44, 1946-49] The aZandé, are they Animists ? But, here, in order to clear the ground, round this essential question, we must first try to dispose of a parallel question which often obscures or confuses the foreground of the picture. Let us then first ask The aZandé, are they Fetish-ists ? The answer is that the aZandé make to themselves no graven image or painted personification as an object or instrument of religious cult. Their religious conception remains more spiritual. After the comparison, for the purpose of definition, of the term Animism, we are better able to reply to the essential preliminary : The aZandé, are they Animists ? Indeed the Zandé has not yet had the advantage of contact enough with Europeanism to have created god in his own image. An Islamic conception of god is, at this stage of his evolution, more intelligible to an untravelled and unsophisticated Zandé. Before the Christian conception was bruited abroad round Zandé-land, at first contact with it the average Zandé was deeply shocked by any mundane materialization or anthropo-morphic representation of a Great Spirit. Their religious beliefs would indeed lead this people to subscribe wholeheartedly to the pure doctrine that "God is a Spirit . . . nor hath any man seen God at any time". His very language, unconscious and faithful reflection of his thought- processes and mind, makes for the Zandé a clear distinction between the animate and inanimate realms. To express himself, the Zandé uses four genders. 1. The masculine gender includes only people of the male sex. 2. The feminine gender includes only people of the female sex. 3. The animal gender includes all the animals, whether male or female. 4. The neuter gender refers to all inanimate objects. It includes, for example, trees, rivers, plants and mountains. Each gender has its separate possessive adjectives and distinct pronouns. So distinct are the neuter objects from those whose greater perfection lies perhaps in their faculty of sound or movement, that this people have evolved a separate gender to distinguish them beyond all doubt. Beyond mankind, the Zandé does not attribute life on the Earth to other creation than the anima-1. Exceptionally, among visible and moving objects which are neither in or on earth, but seem to him to influence mankind, the moon (which is male), the stars, the rainbow and the lightning (which, when unleashed, is a savage beast) are brought within the animal category of gender. In regard to spirits, the aZandé people do not share with modern Europeans the formidable and often fantastic fear of larvae, of anthropo- morphic phantoms or of visible night-ghosts of the dead. Nevertheless, affection or respect for the dead dictates a simple but careful burial of man.</page><page sequence="5">An African Culture of Today. 197 In most of the units of the Zandé confederation, a married person is not expected to accompany his or her companion to the grave. Graves are rectangular and are oriented in the sense north-south. If the dead is female, she is interred in a transverse alcove facing east. If the dead is male, he is set in the alcove on his left side and facing the setting sun. 'He has Gone West/ He has gone to his Long Home, and the mourners will mourn for half a year. Bangiliko MU. Ko 'ga fwe topé. "His eyes are darkened. He has returned (to earth) behind the hoe (the hole-maker)." 1. The Supreme Spirit (Mboli). a) Beliefs concerning the Supreme Spirit. The existence of a Supreme Spirit known as Mbõli, or among the Zandé outlanders of the Nilotic Sudan as M bori, is universally recognized and accepted by the Zandé people. Mbõli makes himself felt to the Zandé in every phase of his daily activities. He is not, as are so many African deities, so much a-god-to-be- propitiated. He is rather to be prayed to in order to avert evil, inflictable or inflicted by spirits. His is a "Fixed power divine which moves to good", though haltingly. His general tendency is felt to be benignant. But, if he is slow to anger, he is slow also to good. His response to prayer is sluggish. He needs to be constantly reminded of the good disposition or merit of the human individual in order that his benignant potentialities may be stimu- lated and put into action on the individual's behalf. But, woe betide the Zandé who calls casually or overweeningly to the Supreme Being, or who represents himself to be practising virtues or merits which he does not in reality possess. Hence it is to their negative virtues that would-be supplicants most frequently draw attention in protestation or in prayer. Mbõli appreciates the moral virtues as they are conceived by the community, who feel themselves consciously to be beneath his ubiquitous and absolute domain. He intervenes frequently in daily life to chastise ößpic by the stroke of illness, or to loose the bolts of death upon those who have neglected or inadvertently laid shame upon the manes of their clan. No trace of any anthropomorphic conception of Mbõli has come before my notice. Nor is any Zandé believed to have seen the Supreme Spirit incarnated under any guise. The usufruct of earth, air, fire, water and the animals of the chase are consciously held to be conceded to man by Mbõli, whom the majority of aZandé consider to have caused them to be brought into existence. Among aZandé completely ignorant of European or Arab usage, I have not been able to remark any idea of a specific dwelling-place of the Supreme Spirit, nor any conception of a celestial or chthonic abode of the disembodied</page><page sequence="6">198 Tracy Philipps, [41-44, 1946-49] dead. One would naturally not base on this merely negative result a denial of the possibility of existence of such conceptions. I have had eager and even elaborate pictures of such ideas offered to me by Christian and Moslem aZandé, but, among untravelled villagers, I have not been able to observe any such formulated ideas. The Zandé would appear to feel a conscience (whether clear or sinful) in regard to Mbõli. During the sudden and devastating thunderstorms and tornadoes which sweep along the Congo-Nile Divide and down the valleys of the Ubangi and the Uele, the people in the fields will gladly seek the covering fly of a stranger's tent, or huddle with him in a friendly hut. One may observe thus, at one's ease, an alarmed and unselfconscious crowd. In the short silence which follows some particularly earth-shaking crash of thunder, one may frequently hear a voice from among the crouching figures invoking protection of Mbõli against the Gutnba, or lightning-beast, that strikes with the "blinding death". The voice or prayer protests audibly but quietly its innocence of offences held to be repugnant to Mbõli or likely to attract a physical manifestation of his displeasure, at whose leash the dreaded Gumba ever strains, at whose nod it is released8. The remarks actually reproduced are those most fre- quently overheard in the mouths of different aZandé on some dozen occasions. Mi adinga ga boro ohe te - "I have not stolen things of any man". Ga Mbõli pai du! - " Mbõli' s affair it is !" Ka Mbõli aidanga te, ka mi kpinga háleme ya! - "If Mbõli doth not desire it, (then) let me not die today!" From a moral and political standpoint the influence of Mbõli may generally be said to be a healthy one. There exist to my knowledge no legends regarding Mbõli which would lead one to classify him in the lower grade of apotheosized heroes such as exist among most of the agricultural baNtu-speaking, or the pastoral Hima, peoples. The whimsical and popular national hero of the Zandé is Tule. Tule could perhaps best be described as "a card". The collection of the aSangbwa Tuie or tales of Tule form the daily fairy-tale and Folk Lore literature of the people. His position nearly corresponds to that of Kabundji of the Lulua, whose stories I have heard with delight over camp-fires in the Kasai. Neither names have fear or reverence, though they may have a tolerant admiration, attached to their characters. Indeed, the very mention of their names brings an expectant smile to the lips of the people, who always hope to hear some sly new exploit or some brave fantasy about them. The position of Mbõli among the aZandé is rather comparable to that of the Supreme Being Imana among the monotheistic peoples of Ruanda 4. 8 In the Zandé language, similes and picturesque imagery are very frequently derived from the use of dogs in hunting and of spears in war. Indeed the aZande often actually say : Gumba du ko-yo du Mboli ni, wa gako ango - "The lightning is there where Mboli is, as if his dog". 4 See Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, April 1923.

But Mbõli often causes or permits death to supervene. Against Mbõli no magic may avail. But, first divination must be invoked to ascertain whether death be due to an evil-eye of. the evilly-disposed. If the reply be negative and no indications against the living are announced, then the death must be accepted with resignation. "Mbõli has let the heart-beats fade." Ko hingt (they say) bangiliko bili - "He is lost ... his eyes are blackened (i. e. obscured)." Or, Ko ga fwe topé - "He is returned (to earth) behind the spade (the hoe, the hole-maker)." The Zandé speaks of human death in periphrases. He seldom employs the bald term kpyo, "death", and never in reference to his own relatives. Ko nyesi, "he is finished". Mbõli has let the heart-beats fade, but he has galvanized the dormant soul into activity. He has taken it forth into the ambient spirit-world, active and invisible. Henceforth the soul is an entity to be reckoned with. It is beginning its period of real activity. Previously it could be kept in order by the family and neighbours through the tangible and controllable body in which it dwelt. Mbõli alone can be sure of controlling it now. Mbõli appears to be continually present in the Zandé subconsciousness. Indeed, the idea of the presence of Mbõli seems to hover at the edge of the Zandé consciousness more strongly than that of the occasional, though dreaded, spirits who, though more acutely active, appear to fill only a secondary rôle in Zandé life. In peasant genealogies, vaguely dating back over nearly two centuries, combinations of the word Mbõli crop up frequently in family names. Ga~ Mbõli-Pai (of god-affair). Mbõli-Mangi-le (god-made-me). Cf. Ganda, Na- Katonda-Yankola (mother-god-made-me), and compounds of Asapani in some Mangbetu nicknames. The small point concerning the early date of the occurrence of Mbõli in tribal names is only mentioned here because in some African countries the promotion of a mere genius loci, or a relatively unimportant member of the heroic or spirit hierarchy, to do service for the idea of the Christian God has recently produced a temporary crop of modern (usually female) names compounded with that of the favoured hero, thus creating a fictitious idea of his real place in the tribal religion. The reverence and respect shown to Mbõli appear to be universal and to date from a period considerably anterior to European occupation. b) Practice of the Cult of the Supreme Spirit. a) Prayer. Professional rain-makers, as they are understood among many Nilotic tribes, do not exist among the aZandé. Prayers are addressed to Mbõli, accompanied in grave cases by communal offerings, such as in times of prolonged drought. Graven images of man of magico-religious significance are not made by the aZandé, with the exception of the secret society of the Intani, which is of foreign origin and produces, for specific and secular purposes, small</page><page sequence="8">200 Tracy Philipps, [41-44, 1946-49] wooden doll-like images. I have also seen rare specimens of these in ivory, specially designed for chiefs, and sometimes also in clay for women. Many houses, however, possess external mural decorations consisting of human figures representing friends or notables in quite good perspective and tasteful colouring. These possess no religious significance. The audible use of prayer to the Supreme Being is more frequent among the aZandé than among any African race of whom I have direct or indirect knowledge. I would hazard the opinion that the average untravelled Zandé of the bush seldom passes a day of his life without a spoken prayer to Mbõli. The true Zandé is by nature a clean creature. He washes wholly usually twice a day. He does not by preference live in village communities, but isolated in individual families in the bush. "Le Zandé", says Beaufaict (1915), "a l'horreur des agglomérations. Chacun vit isolé avec sa famille." The usual site is on a slope in the shade of big trees which fringe the numerous tributaries of the Uele-Congo, the Sueh-Nile and the Mbomu- Ubangi. (Such a combination of shade and water has facilitated the infection and eastward spread of the Tsetse palpalis which has been decimating the central aZandé with Sleeping Sickness for the past twenty years.) Living with water at his door, and offering up a prayer very frequently after his ablutions, it is not surprising that the motions of his prayer should be connected with his last act of habitual ablution, namely the cleansing of his mouth with water. He takes a mouthful of water, drinking from his hands. He expectorates it on the ground near by, using one of the many variable formulae according to occasion. One may cite a typical prayer which one very frequently hears if one sits and smokes a pipe unobtrusively with them by a twilight fire. Bangile, aboro wene nga yo dunduko. Kina Io, Mbõli, nikasapa ga aboro gbwanga ni lengo - "In my eyes, all men are just (to me). Verily it is thou, Mbõli, who art just a judge over us." The Zandé calls Mbõli to witness : "I hate no man. I am not a disturber of my brethren's peace. O Mbõli, thou art my judge and witness. Let no evil come to me from ill-disposed men or spirits." Again, not so long ago, I was travelling on foot some seven days from Doruma (Sultan Ndorumo) to Diingu (Uele) together with nine aZandé conscripts for the Congo Moto goldmines. Though labour conditions in Moto are good, the lads were very depressed at the prospect of three months' hard labour outside their tribal area, that is, in what was to them a foreign land. After crossing a river of any size, they washed and, filling their mouths with water (to cleanse the mouth before prayer passed through), spat it out groundwards in a shower. And each in turn said with a quiet and simple reverence : Mbõli, ka mi kpinga ku Watsayo y ai " Mbõli, may I not perish in Watsaland !" (Watsa is the distributing centre for the Moto mines.) ß) Offering. No shrines, altars, or sacrifices are made to Mbõli. Such appear reserved for ceremonies of propitiation to the lesser lights of the hierarchy, the disem- bodied spirits. One may, however, see at times, usually early in the dry sea-</page><page sequence="9">An African Culture of "Today. 201 son, that is, at the time of the opening of the staple harvest, fruits and ears of corn in artistic little bunches, apparently individual gifts, placed upon the bare rock surface of the great limonite outcrops which are a conspicuous fea- ture of Zandé-land. Of these dutiful collects and offertories on these altars, and upon their graves, Europeans are apt to ask why the heathen leave good food about as if the dead could come and eat it, or for a God who only lets it rot. But an Animist African would not find need to ask us why we bring pumpkins to church at Harvest for our God to eat, or why we put decorations on our Lord's table only to fade. Nor would he suppose that we put flowers on a grave because we expect the dead to come up to enjoy the smell. And, here, within these lofty resounding domes of smooth round rock there is reputed to be the presence of the holy spirit in the midst of them. And from within many of them the sources of great rivers spring. Such an apparent waste of food, before the season of plenty is fully come, cannot fail to attract the attention of the most casual passer-by. It is thus that one of the few manifestations of communal tribute to the Supreme Being first came to my notice. It was in a season and in an area in which the people, for sleeping- sickness precautions, had not only had to be moved from their natural and spacious habitats, in shade along the gallery-forested rivers, to comparatively sterile ground and into villages along open roads, but had also suffered a simultaneous shortage of rain. Moreover they had then, owing to a previous miscalculation, been moved again in the same season and lost their seed-time by the road-making and forest-clearing entailed. The people's humble offering to M bolt of the fruits of His earth was, one gathered, conceived in this case in honour, and in order to bring about, through His Mediation, a softening of the hearts of the alien kings, princes, and governors who were altering the allocation of the land, and to ask M boli, Lord of the Soil (zandé or sande), to sustain them through the coming scarcity, and to activate, through His powers over nature, the goodwill of the new ground they were to break. The bearers of the offering of first-fruits had, in this instance, been called forth by the chief amid the approbation of the people in increasing procession from house to house. Thence they moved, with simple cadenced song, towards the open table-rock which gives birth to the source of a river and looks out over the whole countryside. The songs or hymns appeared to consist of chorused invocations of a grave liturgie repetition, with phone and antiphoné response. Considerable alarm and despondency were created during our stay at the neighbouring village by a bursting storm which, occurring during the night, washed off a large proportion of the offerings into the stream below. Passing next morning about dawn on my way to hunt marauding game, I was an attentive witness and hearer of the impromptu meeting held on the spot by the earliest passers-by. The communal offering is not necessarily a seasonal 5 or regular affair. 6 The ceremony is not habitually held more than once in a Zandé year, that is, a season. It most usually, but not necessarily, takes place in the month of Banduló, which corresponds roughly to our month of December, and is compounded of the two words Ba-nduló ■■= father (of) mist.</page><page sequence="10">202 Tracy Philipps, [41-44, 1946-49] It is organized as a Service of Intercession as occasion or events demand. It is usually made on the initiative of the Archdivine-r of the senior 'royal' Vongara representative, but there would appear to be no specific offices held in connection with it. The offering is in the nature of an insurance against defective productivity, and also perhaps is a tangible recognition of the power of Mbõli to concede or to withhold the earth's full usufruct. The ceremony is commonly known in the northern area as that of Beléti, which is contracted from the words Ba-eleti signifying 'father-(of)- cultivated- fields'. This may not unreasonably be taken as an attribute of Mbõli, one of whose principal functions consists in acting as the spiritual land-Lord of the A-zandé (sandé, sende), 'users-of-the-soil'. The aZandé are essentially an agricultural people. They possess no cattle, sheep, or goats of any kind, nor do they appear to recollect ever having owned any in these lands. Dogs and poultry are their sole live stock. There remains little doubt in my mind that this dignified and simple ceremony is carried out exclu- sively in honour of Mbõli, the national divinity, the Supreme Being of the Zandé race. 2. Souls (ambisimo) and Ghosts (atólo). a) Concept of soul. The Zandé recognizes the existence of a soul, mbisimo, as part of the composition of every human being. Further, the conception would not appear to be limited to man, but applies also to certain honoured animals, notably those of chief importance in the eyes of the people. The notion, however, is distinct from that involved in the word kilimo, the human (or other) shadow, which appears to have little or no psychological significance. The seat of the soul is within the human body, but opinion is apt to differ as to its precise location. The similarity of the word vusé (stomach) in its compounded declensions, e. g. vuru(-ko: his) stomach, and the adverb of place (probably of the same root) vuru, signifying, in a general sense, inside, may just possibly have caused some slight confusion in the minds of some enquirers who have felt no doubts as to the definite location of the Zandé soul in the gastric region of the body. Thus (mbisimo) kina ku vuru-ko-yo : "is in his stomach" ; but (mbisimo) vuru boro du: "is within a man". The use of the uncompounded nominative : (mbisimo) du vuse-yo: "is in a stomach", would make clearer a detail upon which I feel some hesitation, though the latter and more definite view is certainly held by some of the alien peoples over whom Zandé influence and suzerainty prevails. b) Survival of the human spirit after death. In order to try to avoid even unwitting misrepresentation, or the mis- reading of any interpretation influenced by alien or preconceived ideas as to the survival of the soul after death, I think it safer and more practical</page><page sequence="11">An African Culture of Today. 203 to reproduce here, to enable it to be weighed up and checked by readers, a précis of numerous statements made in the course of casual conversations with French and Sudan aZandé taken down in each case within an hour of their utterance. I should not care to commit myself to an opinion as to how far these conceptions are as yet shared by self-styled or bilingual aZandé (e. g. ba- Pambiya, baHima, baGuru or aMbomu, etc.), who form nearly a majority of the Zandé confederation in French and Sudan territories. The translation is as literal as I have been able to make it, and the nuances of the tenses have been given their full value. One witness was heard to explain to his young son : Ka boro kpi, mbisimo-ni ki ninané n'ani - "When a man has-just-died (that which was) his spirit is wont-to-remain with us (i. e. in the vicinity)." Akaya-ni ki nandù ku zegi-yo - "His corpse fares forth without (i. e. to the grave)." Another Zande remarked : Ku-sayo, akaya nasa tihe rogo gumba - "Later, the body transforms itself into (the space of) a lightning-beast", singiya rogo gani na dunduko - "Or (transforms itself) wholly into (the space of) his beast (? his totemic animal) 6. Tolo-ni ninané be M boli - "His disembodied-spirit is- wont-to-stay (in the) hand (of) M boli" Si nakaraga tihe ko-no du ani ni - "It turns itself back to-here where we are." Ki namanga rani nga agutneni, ni rengo - "And works (on) us who are its kinsfolk, in truth." Of the human spirit, another Zande observed : Ni-ba-sa-sa si nagu ko-no du ani ni - "At times it flits to here where we are." Pai sa, si ninalá- alá be Mbõli dedede - "But (lit. one thing) it just-dwells-habitually (in the) hand (of) Mbõli al- ways." These statements, being a medley of the most persistently recurring phrases of differing types and sexes, are for us perhaps neither very coherent nor very precise. But they are at least a faithful reflection of the natural working of the Zandé mind on a question about which it is intimately though, as it were, shyly concerned. On such a subject, they feel neither desire nor need to be meticulous or precise. The delicacy and patience necessarily expended in eliciting intimate statements in the form of casual or spontaneous expression, and without cross-questioning, seems to me amply rewarded by the higher degree of credibility which may be attached to the results. It should incidentally be added that none of the people whose conver- sations on this subject I recorded had, as far as I could in each case ascertain, any acquaintance with Sango, Arabic or baNgala, which are the respective commercial languages of the three European-political divisions. Any know- ledge of these languages usually points to the individual having to some extent come under outside influence. In the Zandé's belief that the ghost is with, or "in the hand of", Mbõli. 6 That is, it transforms into, for instance, the lightning-totem or into whatever else his totem-animal may be. The lightning {gumba) and the rainbow (wango) are usually referred to in the animal gender, so as to imply that they are potent anima-ls. In this guise they are common totems of the aZandé people.</page><page sequence="12">204 Tracy Philipps, [41-44, 1946-49] I have not found any definite indication of any physical limitation by the assignment of any "place" to Mbõli. When travelling with aZandé outside their own country, I have more than once remarked that they tend to attribute misfortunes experienced abroad to the direct intervention of the offended spirits of kinsfolk buried at home as much as a month's trek from our line of march. In one instance the sufferer went so far as audibly to specify his views of the causative factor. His wife, he surmised, had committed misconduct. His father's atólo were probably evincing simultaneous displeasure on all three persons of the triangle. They would be, so to speak, radiating and publishing a tele-pathic warning so that the wife should make propitiatory offerings and that he himself should return home to supervise both the wife and the propi- tiation for her sin, which at that time he had no desire to do. But this is only a single instance. That was accepted by other aZandé as the interpretation thereof. This would seem to point to a wide sphere-of-influence of the atólo, namely, one that is not confined to the vicinity of the grave, to the home, or even to the tribal area. But I am be inclined to suspect the latter to be commonly regarded as the normal limit of activity of the nation's Spirits. It will not be irrelevant to the wider aspect of the question to record in this connection the similar views of a native of Tanganyika (Káragwé), with whose processes of thought I was very familiar, while in Europe (Spain) with me some years ago. He spoke no European language and had main- tained a quite remarkable reverence for his totemism and his tribal cult. While thus removed entirely from the sights and sounds of African life, there befell him a small but unexpected misfortune of a kind which is normally, among his people, attributable solely to the malevolence of disembodied spirits. He repeatedly expressed great astonishment that this kind of thing could occur in Europe, where the white gods hold sway outside the black zone in which at the utmost they could be expected effectively to operate. The supposed persecutor in his case had, he held, usually been his deceased father's brother who had survived, held the heritage with injustice, and recently died. In the case of the totem-beast into which the physical strength and energy of the dead man is believed to pass 7, no emotion of either fear or surprise is felt at an appearance of the animal concerned in the vicinity of the burying-place. Occasional uneasiness is evinced by unusually frequent visitations at periods of crisis, such as during births or illnesses in the family. The greater nocuous beasts, such as the lion and the leopard, constitute the totems of the aristocratic clans Bokunde (Bakinda), Kulangba, and Vongara. In outlying parts of the confederation these animals are differently regarded by these clans as regards the details of totemic practice. 7 I am under the strong impression that the Zandé does not believe that the dead man is simply and entirely transformed into a (clan) beast, or that his soul enters into a beast, but rather that his store of energy or vital spark goes back into the common fund of vital energy which enables man and beast (of the clan) to persist and thrive.</page><page sequence="13">An African Culture of Today. 205 3. Ghosts, of Ancestors (atólo-abá). The practice of the cult. The phrase atólo-abá, 'ghosts (of) fathers*, is plural. I have not myself heard it used in a singular form. I am not, however, prepared to assert that it is never so used. Atólo-abá is almost more than a mere plural. Its use seems rather intentionally collective as if referring to ancestral ghosts en masse, or to ancestral-spiritdom either of the clan or, in a larger sense, of the Vongara chieftainship which is the unit of Zandé population. Even when reference is clearly to the ghost of a father or mother very recently deceased, and to whom attentions may be overdue, it is the plural form which is habitually employed. Apart from the impression which one thus receives, the atmosphere of the Zandé world seems impregnated with a tacit acceptance of the conviction that each individual is living in a world of spirit-ambience composed of the collectivity of ancestral ghosts who demand respectful attentions in proportion to the recentness of their entrance into the spirit-matter. It is very seldom that the ghost of an individual of more than a generation older than the oldest living head of the house is felt to retain sufficient individuality to merit specific mention or separate physical attentions. In Christian countries, the same might be said of the attention, to the dead as manifested in the care of their last resting place. The expect a%- tion and demand for attention would thus seem to subside proportionately as individuality fades, becoming less imperious as the progressive process of immergence in the spirit-matter proceeds. The stronger the character or the influence of the deceased in life, the more refractory his memory and ghost may be to the swamping and merging of its personality in the spirit-ambience of the clan which enwraps, guides, and guards the interests and destinies of the Zandé family. Rago, says the Zandé, sala háleme kiya - "There is some- thing extra-ordinary in the air today." (Rago is 'atmosphere', ambience, 'air'). On this last point I do not feel competent to put forward more than a tentative suggestion to indicate a line of investigation. Few peoples in the mass are themselves conscious of the significance or origin of their own ideas on such elusive articles of faith. The above are merely spontaneous impressions derived from direct observations in the field. Manifestations of the active physical observances performed by the living Zandé towards his ancestral spirits are chiefly obser- vable during the preparations for war or hunting, at the establishment of a new home, at the construction of new buildings, at the first meal on the new home-site, at the establishment of the first cultivations, and at the harvesting of the results. In short, at any new phase of activity of his life, the Zandé wishes to avert the chance of disapproval ; to tranquillize, and to have the approbation and goodwill of, those of his nearer ancestry in the spirit-world who may still be in a position to exert an influence. Living isolated as the Zandé appears to have done since his appearance relatively recent in these wooded savannah-lands, he has however not developed the spirit of the baNtu-speaking village-groups, whose lives and actions have had first and foremost to be subservient to the good of the community as a whole. The</page><page sequence="14">206 Tracy Philipps, [41-44, 1946-49] Zandé has a very developed sense of Human Rights and of the individual. He is exeptionally devoted to his wife. He is an individualist who expects to (and does) fend for himself. At the establishment of a new home, the simple Zandé erects, usually near the central entrance to the circle of his huts, an "altar" for offerings to the atólo. It is usually constructed from the wood of the tree sasa, of which a stout pole is planted in the ground. The upper part of the pole is either selected for its natural multiple embranch- ment, or is split up so as to form artificially a kind of round and capacious basket. Ashes from the newly established hearth are rubbed upon the lower end of the pole before it is planted in the ground. The height of the basket receptacle from the ground is normally about five feet. The altar is known as tuka or, more fully, tuka-atólo. In the houses of the Vongara aristocracy one often sees the basket with a cover of the same wood placed over it or, in the gbwanga or court (called 'of justice') of an influential territorial chief, a "doll's-house" shrine, about three feet broad and high. The single pillar in such cases is sometimes increased to four, in accordance with the size of the erection which it has to support. The height of the altar from the ground remains usually about the same. As the harvest of maize, potatoes, millet, etc., ripens in the respective seasons, the owner of the house and crops will usually place some of the first fruits upon the tuka as an offering to the atólo, before the family has partaken of any part of the crop for their own food. Certain signs and passes, which give the impression of hands being raised to or over the altar, are made close by the altar before the offering is actually placed in position. I have witnessed this ceremony on several occasions and no uneasiness has seemed to be caused by my presence. The bearer of the offering has, in cases I have witnessed, been a man. He has held in his hand a bunch of the leaves bambili. The preliminary movements of his arms are in an up and down direction. The attitudes recall the motions action of a man in winnowing or sieving. Hence probably the etymology of the phrase to describe the 'Service' may be derived. When on the first occasion, in the Bas-Uelé in the dim mists which immediately succeed the dawn, I came upon a Zandé going through these evolutions before a domestic altar, and asked him politely at the conclusion what they might portend. The answer I received was : Mi ninapeka atólo - "I am winnowing the atólo (or, perhaps, for the atólo)" , that is, I am conducting my service of propitiation. It may be that these motions are used as typical of the acts prelimi- nary, in Zandé-land, to the preparation of the staple food of man. For the word, as I came later to learn, is that usually employed in the term peka moru, "winnow grain" 8. The phrase usually used to describe the propitiation of the atólo in general is voha (or vuga) atólo. Chiefs, perhaps as more responsible for the community in the eyes of the people and of the atólo, are accustomed to cause their offerings to be made daily, about dawn. Nor will a succulent morsel from the "chiefs-right" portion of the meat of the chase - the liver 8 Moru or molu, a species of small millet, commonly known in Arabic as telebun.</page><page sequence="15">An African Culture of Today. 207 or the kidney - be withheld by a pious Vongara. Incidentally, it may be noted that a Vongara is always apt to be more taciturn or deliberately mis- leading on the question of religious observances than the simple Zandé. The a Vongara have lost much and gained little by European occupation. If the atólo are neglected or deprived of the attentions which are their due, the stroke of ill-fortune or the bolts of disease must be expected by the impious. Sores on the feet or in the lips or mouth are among outward and visible signs of the displeasure of atólo. Invisible signs are most often revealed in dreams. In cases of illness attributable, or attributed by diviners, to the atólo, it is a near male relative who at early dawn and in the presence of the patient will make the introductory supplication before the altar. The patient will then cause to be prepared a fowl of white plumage. This he will eat seated close by the altar, most often with its shade cast athwart his shoulders. Others are not encouraged to be near, and a propitious silence is the order of the day. Chattering among the attendant women or children of the household is sternly repressed, usually by the same master of ceremonies or officiant who has already made the preliminary supplication. Spectators are not encouraged to approach within the immediate zone of operations. This is done in order that the full flow of the influence and Virtue', which unbind and release the malady from the patient, may be concentrated upon him and not be diverted or diluted, as might occur if other and distrac- ting persons were near by. No inconvenience or uneasiness, however, has seemed to be felt when I have asked leave to be present with the anxious relatives in the far background. On such occasions one naturally endeavours to repay the courtesy and confidence of the congregation by conducting oneself at least as unobtrusively and as respectfully as would a true belie- ver. The fowl is first offered, perhaps it might be said 'sacrificed', before the altar by a similar winnowing motion, and with a brief set-invocation for the "lifting" of the disease. In cases I have been privileged to witness, the officiant has been a man. I do not, however, think that this is by any means invariable. In instances where the atólo are believed to be of the female side of the family, say, those of a mother and grandmother causing sterility to a daughter of whose marriage or husband they, as is common, may have disapproved, the mediator, is, I understand, sometimes a near female relative. The fowl is in any case usually plucked and prepared by a woman. 4. Spirits, malignant (agilisa) 9. There is no cult, dignity, reverence or ceremony accorded by the a- Zandé to the dreaded agilisa. Yet they are, it is true, described by some aZandé as : Gbibíta atólo nga agirisa - "Evil atólo are the agilisa." 9 From religion flows the code of morality and human conduct. The religion of the aZandé will be seen to differ in detail from the cults and codes-of-conduct of the generality of the peoples, for example, of Eastern Africa. These differences illustrate the danger of generalization on 'The African' by those who are unacquainted with the funda-</page><page sequence="16">208 Tracy Philipps. [41-44, 1946-49] There appears, then, to exist a certain recognized affinity between the aguisa and the atólo or ghosts of men and of the higher animals, but : Pai sa, bangirani ni gu he kiya - "Nevertheless, in our eyes, it is a different thing (in action)." Legbo agirisa kiya - 'The character of the aguisa is not the same." There are certain peculiar Zandé phrases (for the language consists very largely of set-pieces of diction) whose occurrence and repetition in connection with the aguisa never fails to make one start, and jog one's memory into recollections of similarly striking expressions denoting similar experiences in other African tongues : Agirisa namelesa 10 boro ti n mvwo - "The aguisa put a man to flight in the jungle." Agirisa naziya boro aziya ti mvwo na ngara - "The aguisa (just) seize a man with violence in the bush." Agirisa naziya boro aziya ti mvwo ki ninamanga ko na gbibita pai - "The aguisa just seize a man with violence in the wilderness and are- wont-to-do him harm (or, to maltreat him)." Again : Ni ba sa sa agirisa nata boro 12 ata ti mvwo - "Sometimes the aguisa beat a man in the bush." Again : Gu-boro-le nahinga gine, ki naia ko yo gbwe, nay ala hebe - "The man is lost, and remains out there many (days) wandering dazed." Again : K'ani agumeko nandù fwe ko ku mvwo yo ki bi ko, ko ninandu ki li wa ña - "When we, his relatives, go forth to search for him in the bush and find him, he behaves and eats like a beast of the field." Here, then, we have a limited description of the aguisa 13 which is not explicit in detail and is far from coherent. For the Zandé mind does not find it necessary to push his conception of the spirits to the length of phy- sical or comprehensive definition which our more material and logical occi- dental minds demand. mentals, which are susceptible of comparison. Between Africans there is more diversity than exists between Europeans, for instance between Swedes and Greeks or between Poles and Portuguese. Some generalizations are of course applicable to Africans in their common stage of material evolution and where there is common environment. 10 Al elesa. Mela, the intransitive form of the verb, is, for instance, very frequently used of wives who consider themselves ill-treated and run away from home in fear. 11 Ti mvwo, "in the jungle", as opposed to ku mvwo yo, "into the jungle". 12 The Zandé always seem to use the singular form boro, man, rather than aboro, men. In effect, no instance of alleged possession by spirits of more than one single individual at a time has come to my notice. In Belgian Mandated Territory. I have however observed instances of ventri-loquism and hypnotic suggestion effectively exer- cised by priestesses upon limited human assemblies. 13 Azandé, when referring to aguisa in the third person plural {they), will most often use the pronoun ami, which is almost exclusively used of the animal creation as opposed to the three other genders which have reference to neuter things or to man. I have known of cases where epileptics have, by occasional similarity of beha- viour, come to be loosely referred to as aïragtlisa (a-ira-agilisa), "possessors of agili s a" , or, in our inverted parlance, demonic possession by spirits. They are not treated with any particular deference, and are thus presumably not considered capable of spiritual harm. In their periods of calm succeeding any stormy bout of supposed relations with aguisa, they are in some parts held to be prophets of (evil) things concealed from the normal man, but not necessarily of the future. Prophet is here used in its sense of 7rpocp7)T7)ç or 'one who speaks forth'.</page><page sequence="17">An African Culture of Today. 209 What data then have we at our disposal in the actual limited state- ments from the mouth of the Zandé himself ? The agirisa are by some identified with evil atólo. We may then at least assume them on this view to be ghosts of human beings, but not necessarily of any particular epoch, parentage, or class. While of the same general origin, they are clearly marked oñ by a fundamental difference of temperament and intention. They are definitely malignant in manifestation. They do not give evidence of indivi- duality in their activities, but appear to act collectively. No defined set of characteristics nor any human actions of a specific nature are known to draw upon man the sudden bewildering acts of violence to which, in Zandé belief, the healthiest may become victims when alone in certain (haunted) localities in the Bush. Both an access of physical violence is experienced by the victims and also the complete and sometimes permanent overthrow of the mental equilibrium, by which the man appears to be flung back reeling into the beast. There is, of course, a bare possibility in such cases that the physical injuries may be self-inflicted under the influence of mental deran- gement. But the physical position of such injuries, in the several cases which I have observed, does not tend to bear this out as a general theory. Certain definite physical features of the countryside are closely asso- ciated in the mind of the Zandé with the presence of aguisa. A Zandé will, for instance, avoid, especially if unaccompanied, passing over very many of the great rounded smooth rock-out crops known as munga, often a mile square in extent, which are such a peculiar feature of his country, even if such avoidance entails a long and wearisome detour. The Zandé looks particularly askance at those amunga u from whose resounding depths a river springs. In this connection we may compare the nature and choice of the open-air place of offering to the National Protector, the Supreme Being, M boli (see above). Here attention may usefully be drawn to the existence of a Zandé verb munga, which signifies a state of being stupefied or dazed. A further point to be noted is the fact that it is unusual for cases to be believed to occur of a man being subjected to any violent action on the part of the aguisa in his own home. The phrase commonly employed, and already recorded above, is definite in specifying that a man first comes under the violent influence of the aguisa in the wilderness [ti mvwó). Here he is then driven headlong until exhausted. Then he wanders dazed and aimless until death supervenes, or he is found. I have never heard it suggested that the aguisa are seen in human form, nor that the marks of violence on the body of a victim gave any impression of having been inflicted by wild animals. The instances which have directly or indirectly come to my notice appeared to have occurred in broad daylight. The aguisa in the eyes of the Zandé would seem to be remarkable by an apparently insensate odium fiumani generis. An interesting statement of opinion was made to me by one' Ngbwa- zegi-no, a French subject, to the effect that he surmised them to be the disincarnated ' spirits of the murdered and the wronged. 14 Amunga is the plural form of munga. AntLroros XLI-XLIV. 194G-1949. 14</page><page sequence="18">210 Tracy Philipps, [41-44, 1946-49] Incidentally, to interpolate a parallel, the banya-Ruanda of Belgian East Africa believe in and foresee such an eventuality. I have attended on two occasions, in the Ruanda 15, the (cave-) burial of murdered baTutsi 'aristocrats'. Burial was, as frequently, by night. As the body was lowered by torchlight through the mouth of the cave on to the lava ledge below, the eldest male relative placed a sheepskin round the body with the spoken formula : "When thy spirit return, may it come unto us mild as a lamb of thy flock/' Ngbwa-zegi-no (mouth-out-here) is old, courteous, and unsophisticated. After many days, over an evening pipe, he confided to me an experience which had befallen his father by the agency of aguisa. On the completion of his narrative, I commented on the experience as "rare and extra-ordi- nary". He assured me that it was not. His father had walked out early one morning on to a munga, within half an hour of their home and overlooking the Ubangi River, to try to descry the position of a hunting-party operating in the neighbourhood. His father was at that time in perfect mental and physical health, nor had he any experiences in the past in which the influence of the aguisa could be suspected. At the time of the evening meal he had not returned. As the hunting-party was still absent, he was presumed to have joined it, and no alarm was felt at home. At dawn of the next day, however, he had not returned, whereas the hunters had come back in the early part of the night and had not seen anything of the missing man. On the following morning, one of his wives, who had gone out to collect firewood, came upon her husband's spear lying in a small rocky depression on the further side of the munga, about a quarter of a mile from the base of the outcrop. The position of the spear, with one side partially blunted, showed it to have been suddenly thrown carelessly or dropped ; irregular footsteps showed signs of a hurried departure. No trace of other tracks were visible. The woman ran back to the home. A hue and cry was raised. A hasty offering was made to the atólo. A search party of relatives hurried off to the scene of the discovery. It was not until the following day, about sunset, that they came up with the missing man. He appeared to be wandering aimlessly away from the direction of his home. He was obviously exhausted and hobbling painfully. He was badly battered and bruised about the eyes, the feet and the small of the back. He was quite unable to give an account of his condition. He appeared terrified of the members of his own family, of whom he showed no signs of recognition. When approached, he endeavoured to escape. When unable to do so through weakness, he fell on the ground and began to chew the grass. He was wrapped in a rough sleeping-mat and carried home. Despite every effort to calm his inexplicable fears, he never properly recovered his faculties, and "died a broken 'man before two moons had waned". No further facts transpired. No mystery was suspected. It was just the aguisa. In 1921, at Utiandumbu, in the Congo forest, where the people of the 16 The word ruanda comes to signify the 'realm'.</page><page sequence="19">An African Culture of Today. 211 region are baNtu-speakers, I had the fortune, by chance to witness what appeared to be a similar case of a man who had just been found wandering far from any habitation in a dazed condition, and was being brought in by his relatives from the forest, where he was alleged to have been seized and possessed by spirits. Unfortunately I did not speak the tribal language, though I had acquired just that sufficiency which so often gives rise to misun- derstandings. There was, however, no difficulty in communicating with the people in the commercial lingua franca of the Congo. The subject was a young man who was stated by his relatives never to have been previously anything but healthy. His condition and appearance were quite pitiable. His whole body was bruised and lacerated. His mouth was flecked with foam. The swollen eyes goggled half open with a kind of stricken stare. He appeared to be in a state of trembling terror, which oddly enough did not manifest itself so much when I approached him as it did towards his own relatives,, who seemed to be doing everything in their power to calm and nurse him. When approached by them, he threw himself on all fours with his face on the ground. He gnawed at grass and leaves. He made motions with his already bleeding hands as if wishing to burrow underground, perhaps to hide himself. The fleeting impression on my mind was of seeing a creature possessed by a demon, of a human being being recently invaded by the nature and instincts of a beast of the field. I recollect that at the time there passed through my mind the experience of one Nebuchadnezzar, who "was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagle's feathers and his nails like bird's claws." The only rational suggestion that I could make to myself was that,, following on some aggression or imprudence of his own, the man had been set upon by some of the larger anthropoid apes, which we had ourselves frequently heard and occasionally seen in the forest. But the people would have none of it. They were apparently in no doubt as to the cause : Ndoki abulaki ye kuna na jamba - "An evil spirit did him harm there in the jungle." Ndoki asir' apiki ye, na kubuka tanyo naye nyoso - "An evil spirit has assaulted him and broken his mind entirely16." 16 The language is baNgalla (HNgala).</page></plain_text>
