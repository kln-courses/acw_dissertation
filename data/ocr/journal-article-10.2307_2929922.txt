<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Following Tributes Were Offered at the Memorial Service for Paul de Man Held at the Yale University Art Gallery on January 18, 1984. We have gathered here today to honor Paul de Man, his accomplishments and his influence. The ten friends, colleagues, and students of Paul de Man who will each say a few words about him can hardly be said to be "representative." Paul de Man would have smiled ironically at that idea and have murmured something about the aberrancy of synecdoche. Each of us speaks for herself or himself. After this ceremony is over there will be an informal reception in the Comparative Literature Library on the eighth floor of Bingham Hall for those who want to greet Mrs. de Man and one another. I want to speak not about de Man's power as a teacher and as a writer, but about the extraordinary intellectual authority he exerted on his friends and colleagues, at least on me. Paul de Man much disliked words like "power," "force," or "authority," especially when applied to the academic world. He would have smiled ironically again and more than a little scornfully at the idea that he had what those words name, though obviously he did. What was the source of this authority? Though it was surely in part his extraordinary person- al charm and his imperturbable good humor, a kind of radiant joy in the posses- sion of intellectual mastery, these do not quite account for it. I suggest that Paul de Man's intellectual power sprang from a double orientation toward the situation of the reader which was fundamental to his thought. On the one hand he assumed and tirelessly demonstrated that most students of literature, even the most renowned or distinguished, are aberrant readers. Each of us most likely dwells in a wandering state of delusory belief in a whole set of interlock- ing mistakes about particular authors and about literary history. De Man was fascinated by the question of why this should be so. He saw it as related to the broadest questions of epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, the institutionalizing of knowledge, politics, the life and death of culture. As he said once to me this past fall, speaking of the current polemical situation in literary studies, "the stakes are enormous." On the other hand, this calm assumption of almost universal aberrancy was not only held in the name of an attainable truth but even held in the belief that all of us are in the truth, even speak the truth, without necessarily knowing it and yet without being able to do otherwise. As he says in one of his last and as yet unpublished essays, "Whatever truth may be fighting, it is not error but stupidity, the belief that one is right when one is 3</page><page sequence="2">4 Yale French Studies in fact in the wrong" ("Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," p. 4). Far from holding, as he and his associates are sometimes said to do, that interpreta- tions are free-floating, Paul de Man held that they are to be measured by a truth which is at least a possibility of "the negative knowledge of error."2 Who would wish to be stupidly aberrant when one might at least know that one is in error? The other part of Paul de Man's authority, then, was his ability to per- suade one to believe that one is in spite of everything, in the truth. Even the most naive paraphrase of a poem repeats the disruptions and discontinuities which are the truth of the text and which the paraphrase is intended to cover up. Far from placing authority in some will to power of the critic, as, once more, he and his colleagues are sometimes, quite falsely, said to do, Paul de Man placed the ultimate source of power and authority where in fact it is, in the words on the page. De Man's clearest statement of this is in the "Foreword" to Carol Jacobs' The Dissimulating Harmony. If I may dare to say so, the future of literary studies depends on reading Paul de Man as best we can, on being true to his example as a reader and as a continuator of the long tradition of literary study to which he belonged. Here are his words in a characteristically rigorous and elegant formulation: "Understanding is not a version of one single and universal Truth that would exist as an essence, a hypostasis. The truth of a text is a much more empirical and literal event. What makes a reading more or less true is simply the predictability, the necessity of its occurrence, regardless of the reader or of the author's wishes. 'Es ereignet sich aber das Wahre' (not die Wahrheit) says Holderlin, which can be freely translated: 'What is true is what is bound to take place.' And, in the case of the reading of a text, what takes place is a necessary understanding. What marks the truth of such an understanding is not some abstract universal but the fact that it has to occur regardless of other considerations.... It is not a matter of choice to omit or to accentuate by paraphrase certain elements in a text at the expense of others. We don't have this choice, since the text imposes its own understanding and shapes the read- er's evasions." This general confidence in our ability to get it right as readers, after all, was the other half of Paul de Man's authority over those he touched. J. HILLIS MILLER I imagine that over the past weeks many of us have been remembering the moment when we first "discovered" Paul de Man. For me, that discovery took place twenty-five years ago, when as a college senior I walked into a room in Sever Hall, in the Harvard Yard, to have a look at a course called "Valery, Rilke, and Yeats." The class had already begun when I entered. The teacher was sitting at the desk, with Yeats's Collected Poems open before him, talking, and as he talked his hands would move upwards from the page, as in a gesture of 1.

It was as if I had come into the presence of a magician, working the spells from some old grimoire, taking what turned out to be that peculiar early poem of Yeats, "The Wanderings of Oisin, " and by the newest and least under- standable of alchemies freeing from it the shape of a passionate and perplexing allegory of reading. To be given to understand that there was this kind of drama available in the reading of texts, that what was at stake in the study of literature was as difficult and demanding and unsettling as philosophy or any other mode of discourse-this was an enthralling revelation. I recall that during the year following that class with Paul de Man-when I was supposed to be reading history in England-I found myself puzzling over Mallarme and Proust in a kind of muddled homage to what I construed to be the questions he had raised. I blame it on Paul that I decided to go back to Harvard for graduate study. Alas, when I got there he had moved on to Cornell. It was not until another ten years had passed that I would make the still more important discovery of Paul as colleague and friend. The image of the magician didn't entirely disappear, but now the magic included that remark- able generosity, patience, and understanding, that gift for attentive kindness, that made any meeting with Paul-even the meeting of a committee that included Paul-full of moments of rare humor and warmth and fellowship. From the array of memories that come to mind on this occasion, I'll mention only one, which concerns a trip Paul and I made to the headquarters of a corporate foundation in New York, in search of a grant for the Literature Major. This potentially dismal venture became in Paul's company an improbable and festive outing. When at last we sat in an office high above Park Avenue, amidst the symbols of American corporate might, I found myself watching the face of the foundation officer, at once bemused and slightly alarmed, as Paul explained that it was entirely legitimate to consider the entire epistemology of the sci- ences of man to be founded in a lie superimposed upon an error, and then went on to instance the kind of error that the foundation officer would have commit- ted had he named his son "Achilles" in the expectation that this would make him act like a lion. The outing had suddenly improvised a sumptuous intellec- tual picnic. And somehow even in this alien context the power of that mind and its unanswerable, unsettling logic made itself felt. We in fact got the grant. Let me close by remembering for one more moment that course on Valery, Rilke, and Yeats that marked my own discovery of Paul. I have not forgotten the poem he gave the class to explicate on the final exam; it was Yeats's "At Algeciras-A Meditation on Death," which, you may recall, ends with the lines: Greater glory in the sun, An evening chill upon the air, Bid imagination run Much on the Great Questioner; What He can question, what if questioned I Can with a fitting confidence reply.</page><page sequence="4">6 Yale French Studies Paul was himself eminently the great questioner. We who were privileged to be present at his questionings, and to feel the intellectual and the human warmth they generated against the chill air of their implications, can only feel how much we miss him. PETER BROOKS A tremendous light for humane life and learning is gone and nothing for us will ever be the same. I think of Paul de Man always in terms of lucidity, as a radiant presence. "Brilliance" is a word that takes on a special and full meaning when it is associated with him. To find special and full meaning was Paul's profession and way of life. He had absorbed and not abandoned all that Europe could teach a spacious and effortless mind-all that literary culture and science and the upheavals of the twentieth century had to say, and then he saw, from his oblique and direct perspective, what more there was. He parsed complexity in all things to find the root of simplicity. He was impatient with easy complications. He wanted to find the beginning, where the light started. He was a man who could never be surprised and yet who was never indif- ferent. He maintained the highest standards in all things and believed no task or chore was beneath doing with elegant dispatch. A university was his natural home; he and a university were instinctively congenial to each other. How fortunate we were that he was with us here, although he and Yale really held each other in trust for the benefit of those everywhere who cared for humane learning. His students were his public joy, the enduring human links to our common civilization. His family was the center of his life, and there his wisdom, his humor and his radical human touch shone brightest. He knew that of all the things that pass, and all things do, human affection lasts longest and sweetest. I shall always see his shy and candid smile. It was luminous, and word- lessly encouraged us to be better. A. BARTLETT GIAMATTI A month has passed, but a month is nothing; and the wound that thought gives, that memory enforces, remains fresh. "The set is broken"-that phrase, Word- sworth's when he heard of his youngest brother's death, came involuntarily to my mind, so close did I feel to Paul; so close, I assume, everyone of his col- leagues felt; and that he was the oldest, not the youngest, was only a sem- blance, for, in fact, we knew him to be the one who had most the resistance to time, a vigor, a vigilance, a stability that went far beyond what the emigre, the uprooted person, usually carries within. So, in the space war of the theorists, he became the Yoda figure. From the</page><page sequence="5">IN MEMORIAM 7 beginning, those remarkable essays in Critique, which during the 1950s meant so much for us, expressed a sense that there were no sublime monuments, only perplexed readings, or that, as he put it with a poetic and aphoristic gift akin to a Hegel he was always seeking to disenchant: "Substance itself . .. is the abyss." Nevertheless, he viewed each essay in poetry or philosophy as a "su- preme wager" within and against language, as if it could achieve a sort of clarity, at least a clearing in which the work of thought became a working thought rather than a consolation. It is that very clarity which, separated from Paul, we now need. Nothing can console us except his writings, however unseduced and un- comforting they are. They have more of a personal stamp than we may present- ly see; and to claim them, to interpret them, is a natural form of grieving. They are so consistent, yet so unpredictable; in them every sentence goes to the mark, we see it and don't see it, like a curve ball right in over the plate. Yet I cannot say at this moment that there is no bitterness, when one thinks of what was left unfulfilled. It is hard to believe that he and Pat-who was always a presence nearby-came to Yale less than fourteen years ago. It was Paul's intellectual passion that sustained the teaching of literature at Yale, and never allowed false polemics to divert attention from the pedagogical task. He had wit, he had judgment, the classical virtues; and he put them where they were needed-in the service of the Romantics, for instance, who had been mistaught, praised or despised, canonized or decanonized, for the wrong rea- sons. And perhaps it was no accident that he was drawn to writers who recog- nized "cold mortality" without ceasing to be, in Shelley's words, "a mirror of the fire for which all thirst." If Paul's clairvoyance, his mirroring of that fire, was a trouble, it was so not only to others, but also to himself. He made his mind increasingly more severe, and those who remember him listening fixedly to lectures by students or visitors know he could always spot the vulnerable point which turned the monumental thesis into a mortal project. Yet, however uncompromising he seemed to be, he was the most gracious of persons, never dismissive, even if he knew "de Trut," the most considerate and engaged teacher, the most agreeable conversationalist. Who will forget his smile, which remained with him almost to the end? The last time we taught conjointly was at the School of Criticism and Theory in the summer of 1982. He was already ill. Yet the day before his illness obliged him to return to New Haven, he saw every student in his seminar till late at night, to discuss their ideas, or simply to chat and so tide them over. We had come back from a platform performance a few days earlier, and these things etch themselves in the mind: someone there in the audience tried to break down Paul's gentle, unrelenting exclusion of self-reference, his version of Pas- cal's "Le Moi est haissable." This challenger from the audience pointed tri- umphantly to Paul's own presence-why are you here, in person, if you believe as you do-and Paul's smile became a glint of steel, as he replied: the text matters, what you write matters, everything else is vanity. His text matters;</page><page sequence="6">8 Yale French Studies and I believe I am following his own lesson when I say that his example made a difference, that all who heard him, as teacher, friend, or colleague, changed their relation to the written word. GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN Wednesday afternoon-this very hour-was throughout the years the time reserved for Paul de Man's class. It is fitting that we should today recall him in his teaching time, for his teaching now recalls us, and will never cease to summon us. Today-a Wednesday-Paul would spend the morning in the library, have lunch with a colleague, and in the afternoon, would take the elevator to the eighth floor of Bingham Hall, where a crowd of students would await him. (I remember: as his young colleague, I myself used to attend some of his classes, for I felt that through him, through his works and through his person, some- thing extraordinary spoke.) He would come to class, put down on the table his always far too heavy brief-case, take out some books in English, German, French, and would invariably-in his self-effaced and unexpected manner- make a joke, make the waiting of the class explode with laughter; and his jokes would always be in some sophisticated manner joking at his own expense, pedagogically disclaiming, in a Nietzschean manner, his own authority: Verily, I counsel you: go away from me and resist Zarathustra! ... Perhaps he deceived you.... One repays a teacher badly if one remains nothing but a pupil.. You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra? You are my believers-but what matter all believers? ... Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have all denied me will I return to you.3 Paul disclaimed his own authority, yet none had more authority than him. He did not seek leadership, yet he was naturally at once an intellectual leader and a human guide. I remember having lunch with Paul de Man right after my father died; I remember Paul facing my silence, my incapacity to talk, and gently talking then to me, for the first time, about the people he had lost-about his own experience of surviving death-speaking of himself only so as to enable me to speak, to break out of my silence. There couldn't be a more delicate means of telling me that the way death-or the loss of those we love-is inscribed in our life, even while it 3. Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, tr. Walter Kaufman (New York: The Viking Portable Library,) first Part, 3, 190.</page><page sequence="7">IN MEMORIAM 9 disrupts our words, should also be that out of which we talk: that out of which we talk to one another. As a friend, as a colleague, as a thinker, as an educator, Paul was an infi- nitely giving person. He was generous with his time; he was generous with his ideas; he was generous with his suffering; he was generous even with his own mortality. When he learned he was terminally ill, his first concern was not so much about his own death as about Yale's welfare. I will never forget how, from his hospital bed in which he was recuperating from his first emergency operation, he addressed us (visitors, colleagues and friends) with the question: who should replace him? Who would be best for Yale after his departure? I remember how I wanted to protest-because I was myself too plunged in his and my own pain, too overwhelmed with the grief of his mortality-I wanted to protest and say to him: just now, Paul, all I care about is you, just yet I couldn't care less about what will happen after you, who will replace you, don't you see that a person like yourself, with this kind of generosity and courage even in the face of death, is irreplaceable? But he was wiser, and his own concern was, as always, transcendent to his own pain, transcendent to his own anxiety and to his own self-centered in- terest: his own concern, then as always, was tied up with life: the life beyond his own; the work that would go on beyond and after him. His concern was- our own survival. Such was the power of his extraordinary mind. Such was the power of his extraordinary heart: the liberating power of his generosity and courage; for in his thinking, in his teaching, in his being in the world, he was above all this: a liberator. On his deathbed, he became, thus, all the more a giver, all the more a teacher: transforming his own death into a life-lesson. He was teaching us how, even in the face of death, mortality can be experi- enced, consummated, and assumed in creativity, how life can be asserted in acts of intellectual and human kindness. Thank you, Paul, for having taught us, even through the process of your loss of life, how life can triumph. May we live up to your precious memory. May we, through the loss of you, learn how to live up to your triumph. SHOSHANA FELMAN It feels strange to go against the grain of Paul de Man's own vocabulary, and to feel compelled to use, in speaking about him, the very words that he was most</page><page sequence="8">10 Yale French Studies suspicious of-words like integrity, honesty, authenticity, generosity, even seductiveness. The last thing he probably would have wanted to be was a moral and pedagogical-rather than merely intellectual-example for generations of students and colleagues, yet it was precisely his way of not seeking those roles that made him so irreplaceably an exception, and such an inspiration. He never sought followers; people followed him in droves. He was ironic toward disci- pleship; the country is dotted with his disciples. His impact was so profound and so specific that it is possible to determine from people's work not only that he was their teacher but also when he was their teacher-what he was working on when they passed their time beside him. He was the implied reader driving literary critical pens in every university in the country. Yet when given an essay or a chapter of one's thesis or of one's life, he would respond as Melville describes Billy Budd responding to the chaplain's benediction: "He received, but did not appropriate. It was like a gift placed in the palm of an outreached hand upon which the fingers do not close." This left his students immeasura- bly free-free from the fear of embarrassing him or the desire to reflect him, free to make fools of themselves in their own way, free to differ from him without making an issue of it-free, but never without his support. He lived and worked as much without waste as without haste, as much without compromise as without complacency. His unflaunted generosity and efficiency and singleminded pursuit of his own path were made possible, I think, because he spent so little time looking in the mirror. He did not try to charm away the consequences of the rigor and honesty of his thought, but neither did he glory in the resistance he encountered. Faced with systematic misinterpretation, he would say only, with ironic and moving pseudo-resigna- tion, "I have all the fewer illusions about the possibility of countering these aberrations since such an expectation would go against the drift of my own readings." Reading, indeed, was the one imperative on which he unfailingly insisted-reading in the literal as well as in the broadest sense as the most taken for granted, the most difficult, the most urgent, and the most passion- ately resisted imperative of human life. In a profession full of fakeness, he was real; in a world full of takers, he let others take; in a crowd of self-seekers, he sought the truth, and distrusted it. Although he will never be other than alive to those who have known him and loved him and learned from him, nothing can make up for our loss as we now face a world without Paul de Man. BARBARA JOHNSON Countless students owe their continued presence in the university, and the course that their career has taken, to the support and the teaching of Paul de Man. I was one of those students. On anyone who knew him, or took the time to read his work, he exercised a powerful fascination. On those of us who took</page><page sequence="9">IN MEMORIAM 11 his courses, who read him avidly, who sat for hours in his office, the fascination was particularly strong. It was first attached to the man-to his gait, to the shrug of the shoulders, the set of the head, the quizzical smile. But it had as its truer source a moral trait: what we sensed to be as complete a detachment from the claims of subjectivity or individual personality as was possible. Such a divestment of personal stakes meant that he wielded an un- paralleled strategic skill in the institution. He took each institutional encoun- ter away from the murky plane of the personal, and made it appear to us in its proper light, as a practical question. Free from any hesitation born of the fear of others, he could engage upon and pursue a course of action without a backward glance. We all profited, both materially and by example, from his ability to call our attention away from the shadowy motives we imagined behind each turn of the cogs in the administrative process, or from the games of seduction played out in the classroom. Rather than seeking out the agents responsible for a problem, rather than retreating behind the rules or the deadlines, he asked himself instead whether a question required his intervention, how to give it most effectively. The issues were entirely pragmatic: how was a student to find the money to continue his or her studies? Which would be the proper place to send his letter of recommendation? How and where was a neophyte professor to be given his or her chance to profess? Would his intervention help or hinder? How and when should he intercede? His care was all the more eagerly sought by his students because it hid no suspect pity, voyeuristic kindness, or self- love: he did not need to care about us personally, we thought, because he cared for us, practically, professionally. Women gained by his detachment especially, since in seeking to dispense with the level on which intersubjective dispute might occur, he was effectively seeking to dispense with the kinds of accusations to which they are custom- arily subject. He had himself no time to waste being seduced, disquieted, or threatened by women. And thus no time to waste vindictively barring them from effecting a full entry into the profession. He seemed to have no time to waste barring anyone from entering the profession. His time was devoted to giving us time, to work. His detachment, and our fascination with it, made it possible for us to profit practically from his teaching too. We learned the tools of the trade from him because, as we could hear his detachment, his words could carry weight with us, could ring much truer than ours. If he said in an aside one day that we ought to read Hegel's Aesthetics, we read them, in order to understand why we must read them. If he said that the first draft of Rousseau's Social Contract was more interesting than the second and more polished draft, we spent weeks comparing them. We poured for hours over the little checks he made in the margins of the papers he returned to us. We waited, after a conference, for his question-and discussed it avidly, referred back to it for years. We were not foolish; we were fascinated, and we were learning how to interpret, how to go about gaining interpretative skills.</page><page sequence="10">12 Yale French Studies But while he was able so to divest himself of personal claims as to become an entirely effective teacher in these practical ways, the real tour de force was in the way he unmasked our fascination, explaining in his dryest and most impersonal manner, why his own detachment was necessary. -In the first place, no one can know with any certainty what others' intentions might be- that went almost without saying. But, and here he spoke more insistently, that first question hides another: in seeking to interpret intentions, he suggested, we are avoiding the question of whether intentions are determined by subjects, or by language as figures in texts. The stake of such a doubt was subjectivity, and subjectivity included the moral trait of detachment that we ascribed to him. We found the source of our fascination, his power to speak truth, dis- missed by him as a strategy of our self-love. Our fascination was but one of the illusions he was systematically undoing. We wanted to attribute to him an authority equal to the knowledge that he brought us, an authority from which he was always, with irony, with a shrug of his shoulders, detaching him- self. Finally, what he taught us then was that we could not, fixing our eyes on him too closely, follow him, that we must divest ourselves of our personal investment, our studenthood, if we wished to understand him. But that means that, in a way, he was teaching us how to begin to lose him, how to begin to lose the man and his teacherly qualities: his strategic skill, his keen gift for speak- ing truth, his ear for the unspoken and unthought in our words, his willingness to give of his time, his intellectual rigor. What he could not teach us is how to begin to accept the loss of his ironic stance, that ironic stance that he had achieved over and over toward his own eventual disappearance. Piety toward the work or toward the man capable of such strong irony seems as inevitable as it would be wrong. We ought, to be true to his spirit, to resist that piety as hard as some have resisted his theories. But how can we? How can we begin to mourn what we would need to have still-his irony-in order to mourn him properly? E. S. BURT Five years ago, I remember, in the course of giving an undergraduate lecture on Shelley's "The Triumph of Life" Professor de Man spoke at length about the words "thread" and "tread," and the importance of their difference to the poem. His reading was made considerably more difficult by the fact that he pronounced the two words exactly the same way-as "tread." After some fifteen minutes of tread and tread, he paused, somewhat nonplussed, to look at the audience: "My whole argument is based on the difference between tread and tread, and I can't say the difference. " A moment-of "parabasis, " he might have called it-due, one felt sure, not to any accident of birth, but to a necessity of language, words and their lack. There is certainly no lack of words to say the difference his life made,</page><page sequence="11">IN MEMORIAM 13 especially for those of us who stayed, first in graduate school, then in the profession, simply because of him: his teaching and his reading. There is much to say about his teaching. Always pointing beyond himself, Professor de Man was one of those rare teachers who do not make their own limitations the limitations of the student-a teacher who thus puts the student in an all the more difficult position, for, after all, everyone wants to be such a teacher. "Be like me," says the double bind of such teaching, "but (like me) only in my difference from myself." Those who learned the lesson he had to teach learned not to read like him but like him to read. They learned to listen for and to reread a whole lexicon of new words, not the ones that now serve as the currency of academic journalism, nor just the names of tropes that came and went over the years like harried and somewhat dishevelled Greek gods-cata- chresis, chiasmus, parabasis, metalepsis, anacoluthon, prosopopoeia-but other, more invisible and yet more insistent words that were there from the beginning. On the one side, words like negativity, rigor, terror, aberrant-all the words serving to unmask the unwarranted claims of false immediacy and the easy totalizations of apocalyptic or utopian historicist schemes. On the other side, words like pathos, monumentalization, aesthetification, trivial, reassuring, comfortable-all the words that conjure up the spectacle of cheap imitations of Greek art or leave a sweet taste in the mouth. But what kept these words from being generalized into a system and what kept his reading from being rigidified into a merely negative method was the word "death" which he used as often as, but differently from, the others: more like a punctuation mark or a syntactical break than a semantic unit of mean- ing. This is the word that kept the others honest, that allowed his reading both to demystify a lack of rigor and to account for the necessity of the mystifica- tion. This is the word that served as the mark of articulation between the rigor of reading on the one hand and the inevitable falling back into aesthetic monu- mentalization on the other. It is the word he taught us to read. But precisely because he taught us to read it, it is also the word that makes it so difficult to say the difference his death makes now. Here the word is particularly lacking. And yet this particular lack of a word presents a challenge to the understand- ing, as he would put it, that demands to be read in its turn and thus opens up a space in which we may work to come to terms with his absence-a space in which we may mourn him, however improperly, thanks to his forgiving rigor. ANDRZEJ WARMINSKI Pardonnez-moi de parler dans ma langue. C'est la seule que j'aie toujours parlee avec Paul de Man. C'est aussi celle dans laquelle il a beaucoup enseigne, ecrit, pense. Et je n'ai pas le coeur aujourd'hui de traduire ces quelques mots et d'y ajouter, pour vous et pour moi, la souffrance et l'eloignement d'un accent etranger. Nous parlons moins pour dire quelque chose, aujourd'hui, que pour An English translation of this tribute will be found below, on pp. 323-26</page><page sequence="12">14 Yale French Studies nous assurer, par la voix et par la musique, que nous sommes ensemble dans la meme pensee. Nous savons combien il est difficile de parler en un tel moment, quand une parole juste et decente devrait s'interdire de ceder a aucun usage, toutes les conventions paraissant intolerables ou vaines. Si nous avons, comme on dit en franqais, la mort dans l'ame, c'est d'etre desormais voues a parler de Paul de Man au lieu de lui parler, voues a parler du maitre et de l'ami qu'il reste pour tant de nous, alors que le desir le plus vivant, et en nous le plus cruellement meurtri, le plus interdit desormais, serait de parler encore a Paul, de l'entendre et de lui repondre. Non seulement en nous- memes, comme nous continuerons, comme je continuerai de le faire sans cesse, mais de lui parler et de l'entendre nous parler, lui, lui-meme. C'est la l'impossible, et de cette blessure nous ne pouvons meme plus prendre la mesure. Parler est impossible, mais se taire le serait aussi, ou s'absenter ou refuser de partager sa tristesse. Simplement je vous demande de me pardonner si je n'ai aujourd'hui que la force de quelques mots tres simples. Plus tard j'essaierai de mieux dire, et de faqon plus sereine, l'amitie qui me lie a Paul de Man (elle fut et reste unique), ce que je dois, comme tant d'autres, a sa generosite, a sa lucidite, a la force si douce de sa pensee, depuis ce matin de 1966 oui je l'ai rencontre a Baltimore, lors d'un colloque, a une table de petit-dejeuner oui nous avons parle, entre autres choses, de Rousseau et de 1'Essai sur l'origine des langues, texte alors peu frequente dans l'universite et sur lequel nous travaillions chacun de notre cote sans le savoir. Depuis, rien ne nous a jamais separes, pas l'ombre d'un dissentiment. Ce fut comme la loi d'or d'une alliance, celle d'une amitie confiante et sans reserve, sans doute, mais aussi le sceau d'une affirmation secrete, une sorte de foi partagee dans quelque chose que, aujourd'hui encore, je ne saurai pas cerner, delimiter, nommer (et c'est bien ainsi). Vous savez que Paul etait l'ironie meme et que, parmi toutes les pensees vivantes qu'il nous laisse, qu'il laisse vivre en nous, il y a aussi une enigmatique pensee de l'ironie, et meme, selon le mot de Schlegel qu'il lui etait arrive de citer, une "ironie de l'ironie". Au coeur de ce qui m'a toujours attache a lui, il y a aussi, justement, un certain au-dela de l'ironie qui reflechissait vers la sienne une lumiere de tendresse, de generosite, de compassion souriante pour tout ce qu'il eclairait de son infaillible vigilance. Sa lucidite fut parfois terrible, sans concession ni faiblesse, mais elle n'eut jamais rien de cette assurance negative dans laquelle se complalit parfois la conscience ironique. Plus tard, donc, j'essaierai de mieux parler de ce que son amitie sut donner a tous ceux qui eurent la chance d'etre ses amis, ses collegues, ses etudiants; mais aussi de son oeuvre, de l'avenir surtout de son oeuvre, l'une sans doute des plus marquantes de ce temps.4 Son oeuvre, c'est-a-dire son enseignement et ses 4. Jacques Derrida publiera prochainement un essai en hommage a Paul de Man (University of Minnesota Press) et un ouvrage sur l'oeuvre de Paul de Man (Columbia University Press), serie de conferences prononcees a l'Universit6 de Californie a Irvine en avril 1984 (note de la redaction).</page><page sequence="13">IN MEMORIAM 15 livres, ceux qui sont deja publies et ceux qui le seront bientot, car jusqu'au dernier moment, avec une force, une ferveur et une gaiete admirables il a travaille, multiplie les conferences, les projets de textes, il a etendu et enrichi encore les perspectives qu'il avait deja ouvertes pour nous. On sait deja, et on en prendra de mieux en mieux conscience, qu'il a transforme dans l'universite et hors d'elle, aux Etats-Unis et en Europe, le champ de la theorie litteraire et feconde tout ce qui l'irrigue. II y a impose, en meme temps qu'un nouveau style d'interpretation, de lecture, d'enseignement, la necessite du polylogue et de ce raffinement pluri-linguistique dont il avait le genie, celui des langues na- tionales, le flamand, le franqais, l'allemand, l'anglais, mais aussi celui des idiomes que sont les litteratures et les philosophies, renouvelant la lecture de Pascal aussi bien que de Rilke, de Descartes et de Holderlin, de Hegel et de Keats, de Rousseau et de Shelley, de Nietzsche et de Kant, de Locke et de Diderot, de Stendhal et de Kierkegaard, de Coleridge, Kleist, Wordsworth, Baudelaire, Proust, Mallarme, Blanchot, Austin, Heidegger, Benjamin, Bakhtine, et tant d'autres, contemporains ou non. II ne se contentait jamais d'ouvrir de nouvelles lectures, il donnait a penser la possibilite de la lecture- et parfois de sa paradoxale impossibilite; et ce qui fut son engagement reste desormais celui de ses amis et de ses etudiants, qui lui doivent et se doivent de poursuivre ce qui fut par lui et avec lui engage. Au-dela de ce qui nous est visible dans les textes publies, les siens et ceux qui en appellent aux siens, je puis temoigner, comme tant d'autres, de ce qu'est aujourd'hui le rayonnement de sa pensee et de sa parole. Aux Etats-Unis d'abord oui tant d'universites sont reliees entre elles et vitalisees par la grande communaute de ses disciples, la grande famille de ses anciens etudiants ou collegues qui sont restes ses amis; mais aussi en Europe dans toutes les univer- sites oui j'ai eu, comme ici, a Yale, la chance et l'honneur de travailler avec lui, souvent grace a lui qui m'y invitait: je pense d'abord a Zurich oui tant de fois nous nous sommes retrouves, avec Patricia, avec Hillis; je pense naturelle- ment a Paris, oui il a vecu, publie, partage des responsabilites editoriales ou universitaires (par exemple celles de Johns Hopkins ou de Cornell a Paris-et ce fut pour nous l'occasion de tant de rencontres). Je sais aussi les empreintes qu'a laissees son passage dans les universites de Constance, de Berlin, de Stock- holm. Et je ne dirai rien de Yale, parce que vous le savez mieux que quiconque et parce que ma memoire est trop endeuillee aujourd'hui de ce que je partage ici meme avec lui depuis dix ans, des moments de la simple quotidiennete aux moments les plus forts du travail qui nous liaient tous deux et qui nous liaient a d'autres amis, etudiants et collegues qui le pleurent ici tout pres de moi. Je voulais seulement temoigner, comme le ferait cette sorte d'observateur admiratif que j'ai aussi ete a ses cotes dans le monde academique americain et europeen. Ce n'est pas le moment ou le lieu de ceder a l'indiscretion des confi- dences ou des souvenirs trop personnels. Je m'en abstiendrai donc, j'en ai trop, comme certains d'entre vous, et ils sont trop bouleversants pour que nous ne preferions pas nous enfermer avec eux. Mais permettez-moi d'enfreindre la loi</page><page sequence="14">16 Yale French Studies de cette pudeur pour evoquer deux souvenirs, seulement deux parmi tant d'autres. La derniere lettre que j'ai reque de Paul, je ne sais pas encore comment lire la serenite ou la gaiete dont il y faisait preuve. Je n'ai jamais su jusqu'a quel point il l'affectait dans un mouvement de noble et souveraine discretion, pour consoler et epargner ses amis dans leur inquietude ou leur desespoir; et jusqu'a quel point au contraire il avait reussi a transfigurer ainsi ce qui pour nous reste le pire. Les deux sans doute. I1 m'y disait ceci, entre autres choses, que je me permets de lire parce que, a tort ou a raison, je l'ai requ comme un message a moi confie pour ses amis dans la peine. Vous y entendrez une voix et un ton qui nous sont familiers: "Tout cela, comme je vous le disais [au telephone] me semble prodigieusement interessant et je m'amuse beaucoup. Je l'ai toujours su, mais cela se confirme: la mort gagne beaucoup, comme on dit, a etre connue de plus pres-ce 'peu profond ruisseau calomnie la mort"'. Et apres avoir cite de Mallarme ce dernier vers du "Tombeau de Verlaine," il ajoutait: "J'aime quand meme mieux cela que la brutalite du mot 'tumeur"' "et qui est en franqais, en effet, plus terrible et insinuant, menaqant que dans toute autre langue. Le deuxieme souvenir, je le rappelle parce qu'il dit quelque chose de la musique. Et seule la musique me parait aujourd'hui supportable, consonnante, a la mesure de ce qui nous rassemble dans la meme pensee. Je savais depuis longtemps, bien qu'il en parlat peu, la place que la musique occupait dans la vie et dans la pensee de Paul. Or cette nuit-la, c'etait a Chicago en 1979, et encore a l'occasion d'un colloque, nous roulions en voiture apres un concert de jazz. Mon fils aine m'avait accompagne et il parlait de musique avec Paul, plus precisement d'instruments de musique; ils le faisaient tous deux en experts qu'ils etaient, en techniciens qui savent nommer les choses. Je me suis alors aperqu que Paul, qui ne me l'avait jamais dit, avait une experience d'instru- mentiste et que la musique avait aussi ete pour lui une pratique. Et le mot qui me le fit savoir, ce fut le mot "ame", quand Pierre, mon fils, et Paul parlerent familierement de "l'ame" du violon ou de la basse et m'apprirent que "l'ame" de ces instruments, c'est en franqais le nom de la piece de bois, petite et fragile, toujours tres exposee, menacee, qu'on place dans le corps de l'instrument pour soutenir le chevalet et mettre en communication les deux tables. Je ne savais pas pourquoi j'en fus si bizarrement emu sur le moment meme, obscurement bouleverse par la conversation a laquelle j'assistais-sans doute a cause du mot "ame," qui nous parle toujours a la fois de vie et de mort et nous fait rever d'immortalite, comme l'argument de la lyre dans le Phe'don. Et je regretterai toujours, parmi tant et tant d'autres choses, de n'en avoir jamais reparle a Paul. Comment pouvais-je savoir qu'un jour, de ce moment, de cette musique et de cette ame je parlerai sans lui, devant vous, qui me pardonnerez de le faire si mal a l'instant oui deja tout fait mal, si mal? JACQUES DERRIDA</page><page sequence="15">YVES BONNEFOY Paul de Man La premiere rencontre, vers 1955, au College de philosophie qu'animait, a peu pres seul, Jean Wahl qui fut un peu (sinon beaucoup) notre maitre. La con- ference portait sur "la poesie, le devenir". J'etais venu pour le sujet mais aussi parce que cela m'etait presque une habitude, en ces annees, d'etre a six heures dans la salle poussiereuse de l'Institut de geographie, place Saint-Germain-des Pres, pour ecouter Massignon ou Pierre Jean Jouve, Levi-Strauss ou Georges Bataille.-J'etais venu pour le sujet, et j'en repartis avec une amitie naissante, qui allait se faire bientot admiration, affection. Et pour cela il avait suffi de cette tete au front en avant, penche sur un grand sourire soudain, au dessus duquel filtrait le regard tres bleu; d'une parole presque a voix basse qui, aux moments importants, baissait encore ou s'en- trecoupait d'un petit rire. Ce rire etait malicieux, avec quelque chose de presque enfantin, en tout cas de tres juvenile: il semblait proposer de ne plus penser a l'idee qui venait d'etre avancee, a ce projet saugrenu qu'un jeune penseur mi-critique mi-philo- sophe (ce double choix etait encore assez rare) s'etait donne ce jour-la, d'avoir des idees a propos de la poesie. Mais ce n'etait pas pour autant un rire de derision, un de ceux ou l'on sent la peur et oui s'annonce le dogmatisme qui va faire suite a l'instant de doute. Je sentais dans ce brusque deni du serieux de l'heure a la fois la joie de comprendre, profondement, et l'ironie qui nait de la perception lucide des limites, que ce soient celles de la philosophie tout entiere ou plus immediatement les difficultes d'une pensee personnelle encore fragile, malgre ses intuitions magnifiques. Et etincelaient aussi dans cet enjouement la nostalgie des annees de jeu et la memoire, pouvait-on croire, d'une dou- leur,-avec deja ce detachement, deja cette serenite d'un esprit tout a son travail quelle forme qu'ait prise l'existence, que nous avons vu, quelques-uns, s'approfondir et muirir, se faire ironie pure, et sagesse, pendant tout le reste de ce destin.

Une presence s'annonqait la, avec tout le mystere qui accom- pagne ce qui merite ce nom; c'etait a l'horizon du probleme qui m'importait, qui m'avait requis ce jour-la, une region tout d'un coup plus claire (pas la clarte d'une explication, cependant, ni meme celle d'une methode, plutot celle d'un feu qu'on percevrait a distance, sur une plage, on sent que quelqu'un repare la- bas son filet, recout le ciel a la terre); et ce fut un bonheur pour moi, deux ou trois ans plus tard, quand je vins pour la premiere fois aux Etats-Unis, a Har- vard, pour un de ces grands etes ou l'on va en blanc comme en Inde dans l'humidite accablante, sur l'herbe silencieuse, de retrouver Paul, a Cambridge. I1 vivait alors a Boston, Beacon Street, dans un petit appartement sous les toits, sa fille naissait. Je le revois a la premiere rencontre, approchant sur le yard la tete penchee, souriant de loin, la couleur etonnante du regard deja repandue autour de lui, sous les arbres: il etait midi, l'heure oui s'effacent les ombres. Nous primes l'habitude de dejeuner dans les petits restaurants franqais de Harvard Square, ou de Berkeley Street a Boston. Mais ce n'etait plus pour parler de la poesie et du devenir, tout au moins de faqon suivie, Paul aimait trop l'activite poetique pour s'y referer trop directement et, en somme, s'y etablir, preferant, comme en ses ecrits, evoquer plutot les poetes que la poesie elle- meme, et plutot les critiques que les poetes. Ce n'etait pas s'eloigner de l'essen- tiel, cette faqon de marquer, cruellement, gentiment, les limites d'une metho- de ou les insuffisances d'une lecture, c'etait pratiquer, avec encore ce rire bref et comme lointain qu'il tournait aussi contre soi, une sorte imprevue de the- ologie negative. Et surtout il me racontait l'Irlande, qu'il aimait, parce que, me dit-il une fois, on ne peut pas y distinguer un homme d'une bete ou d'une plante (sans doute parce que le langage n'y est pas separe du sol, par la vertu des mythes et de l'admirable musique populaire), et il evoquait Gott Island oui je regrette de n'avoir pu ni cette annee-la ni d'autres le rejoindre. L'le est au large du Maine, elle n'avait que deux ou trois petites maisons, dans la lumiere. Et elle fut dans la vie de Paul de Man, recommencee tard en Amerique, le centre qui avait si longtemps manque, la justification, parfois le refuge: toujours en tout cas le preuve de l'existence, sinon de Dieu, du moins de cette force unifiante qui, par dessous les tristesses, les nostalgies, remonte, irresistiblement chez certains, pour alleger leur angoisse, comme l'eau le fait sous celui qui plonge. Paul aima en effet, aima passionnement le monde naturel comme il est, prairies et forets, vagues qui bouillonnent parmi les pierres, ce monde de l'im- mediat et de l'eternel dont il ne cessait pas de constater, avec joie au plus vif de son inquietude, qu'il etait et demeurerait inaccessible au langage et meme d'ailleurs a la poesie. Lui qui travaillait sur la particule verbale de faqon si intellectualisee, si mediatisee par la culture-disons, d'un mot: si "seconde", mais il est vrai qu'il ne touchait qu'a des fragments de parole charges deja de l'energie poetique et metaphysique la plus intense, comme s'ils etaient les surgissements d'un feu de l'esprit aussi elementaire et aveugle que celui qui</page><page sequence="17">YVES BONNEFOY 19 mene les astres-il recherchait la grande plage deserte qui s'etend dans les choses de la nature entre nous et la lumiere la-bas, dans l'evidence silencieuse. II s'avanqait vers cet horizon, a tous ses moments de solitude, c'est de la, quand la vie des villes le reprenait, qu'il revenait avec ce courage que nous avons admire en lui, et capable des lors de cette attention comme lavee du souci qu'il savait accorder au plus fugitif etudiant tout autant qu'aux pensees les plus difficiles. Et il n'aima, bien su'r, et avec raison, que les oeuvres de poesie oui paralit, oui est meditee-oui manque, parfois, mais de faqon reconnue par le poete, et douloureuse pour lui-cette lumiere. Wordsworth, Holderlin, Yeats. Et Mallarme, aussi bien. La parole qui se porte dans des hymnes, les derniers de notre tradition religieuse, ou dans simplement des fragments, signes de notre misere, vers ce qui transcende la parole; et qui, s'elanqant ainsi, dit peut-etre autre chose, dans l'economie du langage, que ce qu'elle croit faire entendre, ce qui retint Paul, on le sait. Mais la plus grave erreur qu'on pourrait faire sur Paul de Man serait de penser qu'il aima pour elle-memes, par simple gouit de la verite, ces syncopes de la signification, ces ruptures qui sourdement retentis- sent dans le sens que de grands poetes ont tente de donner au monde. II suivait des yeux, a la surface diapree des enonces poetiques, le jeu des intuitions, des meconnaissances, longue houle jamais brise oui s'echangent sans fin-et pour qui, on ne sait, dans la derive des siecles-la realite, comme l'on dit, et le reve. II se portait, dans ces instants d'attention extreme, au coeur de ce rire de moine zen qu'il avait toujours eu par pressentiment qu'il n'est pas de Dieu, meme au plus profond du langage. Mais s'il regardait ainsi se faire et se defaire l'ecume autour des flottaisons qui viennent de l'amont du fleuve, qui glissent vers l'estuaire, c'est parce que ce qui brille dans les figures et les images quand on les prend ainsi par l'infini de leur signifiance dans la matiere du texte, c'est la lumiere toujours, l'indifferente et sainte lumiere. C'est parce que regarder la derive elargit le ciel, aussi vide demeure celui-ci. Longue serie de rencontres trop espacees, derive-la encore-des projets, des empechements, des chances soudain offertes, parfois saisies: ecoulement des annees qui passent en deplaqant les lieux ou l'on se retrouve, Cambridge longtemps, Ithaca, Zurich, la Provence, le Connecticut, la Californie. Voiture qui s'arrete, tres en retard, devant le Clark Institute, a Williamstown-c'est le musee le lieu choisi pour le rendez-vous, a cause du Piero della Francesca-et Paul et Patricia et les enfants en descendent, ce sont des jours de vacances qui vont se poursuivre ainsi, oui? hors du temps, me semble-t-il maintenant, hors du monde. Autre voiture, incroyablement chargee de bagages qui, etonnee d'arriver dans ce lieu sans route, s'immobilise devant la maison de Valsaintes: et les enfants ont grandi, et dix minutes n'ont pas passe que nous descendons dans le ravin, sous la chaleur, Patricia toujours en avant par la vertu de son pas de chevre. C'est dans le bureau de Paul, a Woodbridge, qu'une certaine petite fille, un dimanche, se risque soudain a aller debout. Quinze ans plus t6t, sur une plage du New Hampshire, Paul faisait un grand feu de bois d'epaves, y</page><page sequence="18">20 Yale French Studies posait des pommes de terre et la viande, c'etait deja la nuit, je me defendais avec des brandons enflammes contre les assauts d'une epee semblable qu'un petit garcon de six ans agitait avec l'agilite gauche de l'enfance. Et la derniere fois ce fut a Irvine, j'habitais pour quelques semaines une petite maison dans les dunes qui sont au bout du campus, et Paul qui etait venu en Californie pour un colloque vint revoir ce lieu oui il avait vecu l'annee precedente lui-meme, ou il avait ete heureux, je le voyais bien. Apres quoi il y eut les deux ou trois rencontres-ici, au bord de la mer, la chez des gens qu'on ne connait pas, c'est le soir, il y a un diner dehors, on s'attarde a parler dans le jardin, sous des lampes-qui sont, sans qu'on le sache, la fin. J'avais ecoute Paul, dans le colloque, evoquer Jauss, presenter sa pensee critique, mais com- me de loin, comme s'il etait dans un autre monde que ces discussions ou cette salle: tant il semblait retire dans l'analyse de quelques mots d'un poeme de Baudelaire qu'il ne suivait pas eux-memes jusqu'a l'extremite de leur sens, revant ce sens, eu't-on dit, si bien que j'avais pense qu'il parlait la de lui-meme, qu'il se parlait. "Je suis deux etres distincts", me dit-il, a peu pres, a la sortie de la conference. Quand la visite prit fin, nous avons conduit, John Naughton et Pn.. .. i i Paul de Man wihhsdagtr</page><page sequence="19">YVES BONNEFOY 21 moi, notre ami au petit aeroport de Orange County. C'etait une apres-midi, il faisait tres beau et tres chaud, comme d'habitude. Et la derniere minute etant arrivee, ou presque, Paul a empoigne sa valise, nous ne sommes pas sortis de la voiture, c'est en silence, c'est invisiblement-comme si souvent-que la vie a fait tourner en cet instant-la un de ces grands praticables dont elle peut leurrer des annees notre affection, notre reve.</page></plain_text>
