<plain_text><page sequence="1">November 2000] Page 21 Lloyd Burton University of Colorado at Denver Wild Sacred Icon or Woolly Cow? Culture and the Legal Reconstruction of the American Bison Introduction Once upon a time (actually, the end of the last Ice Age), great horned beasts roamed the valleys and plains of the northern hemisphere in herds almost too large to imagine. This is the story of two such species: the aurochs and the American bison. Poachers killed the last surviving aurochs in northern Europe about four hundred years ago. But by then they were no longer of much use to humans anyway. Through selective breeding, for the previous six millennia humans had gradually been transforming captive herds of this huge, once-revered wild animal into the smaller, fatter, slower, dumber domestic cow. Today, cattle ranchers in the United States are beginning to do the same thing to bison, which are also commonly known as the buffalo. It is happening biologically, and it is happening legally. In recent years, some western state legislatures have begun to transfer regulatory jurisdiction over bison from their wildlife management agencies to their departments of agriculture, thus trans forming them in the eyes of state law from wild animals into livestock. The distinction is more than academic and legalistic. In the unusually severe winter of 1996-97, it was agents of the Montana Department of Livestock and private ranchers who stood with hunting rifles just outside the north entrance to Yellowstone National Park, killing over a thousand buffalo (a third of the herd) as they migrated down out of the deep snows in the high country in search of forage (Intertribal Bison Coop. v. Babbitt, 25 F. Supp. 2d 1135, 1137 (D. Mt. 1998)). The state government rationale for this action was that the bison might infect cattle herds with brucellosis, a disease known to cause miscarriages in cattle. However, bison-to-cattle transmission of this infection has never been demonstrated to have actually occurred in the field, and cattle are susceptible to the disease only during the late spring calving season, by which time the Yellowstone herd migrates back up into the park's protected pastureland (Fund for Animals v. Clark, 27 F. Supp. 2d 8, 14 (D.D.C. 1998)). It has likewise been those same state officials who have been capturing and slaughtering Yellowstone bison just outside the park every winter since then. These actions have not gone uncontested. A coalition of American Indian tribes and environ mental conservation groups has organized to oppose state efforts to legally transform bison into woolly cows. The tribes see the future biological and legal status of the bison as inextri cably linked to their own cultural survival, while for environmental groups the legal re definition of wildlife as livestock for state management purposes represents extreme commercial intrusion into the manipulation of the very life forms that comprise American wilderness (Torbit and Heckert 1999). This article begins with consideration of the aurochs' and bison's ancestral relationship to their neighboring human populations in Europe and North America, then moves to an analysis of human cultural and legal conflict over the bison-human relationship in the present-day United</page><page sequence="2">Page 22 [PoLAR: Vol. 23, No. 2 States. In so doing, it will demonstrate how state legislative efforts in some areas of the American West to legally reconstruct the bison from wildlife to livestock bespeak a much more fundamental conflict. It goes to the far deeper question (explicitly cultural in nature) of how different groups perceptually construct their environment and ascribe significance to it. For to legislatively reconstruct the bison in this way is also to de-sacralize it. As the analysis in this article will demonstrate, as environmental groups work in consort with various Plains tribes to stop the destruction of the Yellowstone bison herd when it migrates out of the park during the winter months, their actions are based on a world view much more closely aligned with their indigenous partners than with the Euro-American state legislators and bureaucrats who are doing the legal reconstructing. Thus the struggle to preserve the bison reflects not only an effort at cultural survival on the part of the Plains tribes; it also exemplifies a powerful conflict over the ascriptions of significance to Nature within American society as a whole. In seeking to chart a course through this essentially intra-cultural conflict, the article closes with the suggestion of policy alternatives which will avoid the default policy option of, as one tribal herd manager warns, killing the buffalo while keeping the meat machine alive. From Sacred to Satanic: Horned Beasts in European Religious History In the European imagination, wild horned animals have undergone quite a metamorphosis since the last Ice Age. Among the oldest known works of art in all of human history is the depiction of the aurochs and other horned game species (archeological evidence reveals that these Stone Age artists ate as well as admired them) on the walls of the caves of Lascaux, France. Horns of the aurochs and their domestic progeny surrounded the altars to the goddesses of the Neolithic civilizations of the Near East, and the animal figured prominently as the male half of the fertility equation in many of the pre-Christian nature-based spiritual traditions of early Western civilizations (Eisler 1987:22). But at about the same time that their domestication firmly took hold, so did their de-sacral ization by the Judeo-Christian monotheistic traditions. Celtic deities like the horned god Cernunos were later to be imbued with a very different persona. In the third century C.E. Christian theologian Origen observed, "The world of flesh is the world of demons. Gross matter ... is the domain of Satan." And the Christians' icon for evil incarnate was soon to become a half-man, half-beast who sported cloven hooves, a tail, and horns. The sacred no longer existed in nature itself—not in flowing water, not in groves of trees, and certainly not in animals, either domestic or wild. Instead, there was a vertical Great Chain of Being (a Christian appropriation of a neo-Platonist formulation), with God in the heavens above, strug gling humans suspended on Earth below (afflicted, according to Genesis, both by self knowledge which set them apart from the animals and animal instincts which set them apart from God), animals below them, plants below the animals, and vile demonic human/beasts inhabiting the dark nether regions of the Earth itself. Salvation and spiritual purity resulted from rising above our "animal nature" rather than reveling in it (Kinsley 1994:119). The Bison's Path, Part 1—Out of the Past Early European immigrants to North America's Atlantic shores brought along both a burgeoning enthusiasm for the manipulation of nature, and a deeply ingrained religious antipathy to all things wild. What they encountered was a physical environment and a diversity of indigenous cultures unlike anything they had ever known. When they crossed over the</page><page sequence="3">November 2000] Page 23 eastern mountains into the Great Plains, what the immigrants found were sixty million buffalo (Nabakov and Loendorf 1999). They also discovered indigenous peoples who had been living with and off of these vast herds for at least ten thousand years. Bison had not suffered the same fall from grace in North America as had the aurochs and its domestic progeny in Europe. Tribes from Canada to Mexico depended on the animal to varying degrees for sustenance and revered it in their religious practices. It was perhaps most central to the lifeways of the tribes of the western Great Plains (Josephy 1968:58). In addition to being almost the entire basis for their subsistence, bison were (and are) also crucial to indigenous religious beliefs. They are understood to be important intermediaries between humans and the spirit world. The gift of the Sacred Pipe to the Sioux from White Buffalo Calf Woman,who appeared to hunters first as a woman but reverted to the form of a white buffalo on completion of her mission, remains as one of the most enduring teachings in Sioux spiritual traditions (Brown 1953:3). The Plains Indians' reliance on the buffalo for every aspect of their physical and cultural survival was a lesson not lost on the Euro-American immigrants who would eventually fight them in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Fierce and feared combatants, the most effective (and safest) long-term strategy for making war on the Plains tribes turned out to be making war on the buffalo. Representatives of the Interior Department testified before Congress in 1874 that it would be impossible to "civilize" the Plains tribes as long as the buffalo remained in existence (Cong. Record 1874). The enormous migrating herds of bison also made impossible the "civilizing" of the soil by newly arrived settlers and played havoc with railroad operations along the just-completed transcontinental rail lines. Railroads hired hunters like Buffalo Bill Cody to start decimating the herds; he claimed to have killed over four thousand alone in his year as a Union Pacific employee. Passengers were also encouraged to shoot them from moving trains as a form of entertainment. Bison were being killed at the rate of about five million per year by the early 1870s. Congress actually managed to pass a Buffalo Protection Act in 1874, but President Grant blocked its enactment by allowing it to succumb to a pocket veto (Boradiansky 1990:715). By 1899, only a thousand buffalo were known to still exist in all of North America—two hundred of them having sought refuge in the theoretically safe haven of Yellowstone National Park. Poaching in the park was a problem, however. Despite legislation passed to protect buffalo in 1894, the population decline continued until by 1902 the herd size in the park was down to about twenty-five. Once the poaching law started to be enforced, the herd made a gradual comeback. By 1995, the Yellowstone herd was estimated to number about 3,900 animals (Nabakov and Loendorf 1999). Contested Legal Reconstruction Once the Yellowstone buffalo herd had survived its extinction crisis and grown to the status of a viable, self-sustaining population, it also re-established its seasonal migration patterns down out of the park when winters were especially harsh and forage scarce, then back up into the high country in the spring. Though much of the rangeland to the north and west of the park is federal land managed by the U.S. Forest Service, most of that pasturage is leased to private cattle ranchers. Thus, migrating bison are doubly resented by ranching interests: first because</page><page sequence="4">Page 24 [PoLAR: Vol. 23, No. 2 of an as-yet unsubstantiated risk of brucellosis transmission, and second because of compe tition for water and forage on the public range. The Yellowstone bison represent the largest free-ranging non-commercial wild buffalo herd in the United States. But collectively, the greatest number of buffalo in the country now reside on commercial ranches. The ranchers in southern Montana and elsewhere in the West are not trying to eradicate buffalo altogether. Far from it: as both demand for beef products and their prices continue to fall, commercial bison ranching may well provide a crucially important economic boost to this sagging industry. The concern of some (but by no means all) ranchers is with wild buffalo; that is, bison populations which left to their own devices would happily re-inhabit much of the federal rangeland which is now being leased to private ranchers. Different states have taken different approaches to regulating bison populations within their borders. The citations in Table 1 show that some simply define them as wildlife and others solely as livestock, while still others define them to achieve different policy objectives: as wildlife for the purpose of regulating hunting and prosecuting poaching and as livestock for the purpose of food regulation and animal disease control. Among these "dual designation" states, the Montana statute calls for coordination between the department of livestock and the fish and game commission regarding the status of wild buffalo but gives pre-emptive authority to the livestock department whenever disease control or estray control is implicated. Montana law also indemnifies from prosecution under the state's poaching statute any rancher who kills a wild buffalo on the rancher's private land. Being oblivious to political borders and property boundaries, when bison set foot outside the border separating the sanctuary of Yellowstone National Park from other federal lands in Montana, or the sanctuary of Grand Teton National Park from other federal lands in Wyoming, they unknowingly cross over into a different and far more dangerous, uncertain situation than just the climatic extremes of these high country parks. As of this writing, whether or not they survive depends less on the suitability of the winter habitat than it does on which federal judge has been chosen to decide their fate. For as the following comparison of two recent district court decisions demonstrates, some judges find it far easier than others to see bison as woolly cows rather than as wild sacred icons and to allow them to be treated accordingly. In November of 1998, a federal trial court in Montana handed down its decision in Intertribal Bison Cooperative v. Babbitt in which it turned aside an effort by several dozen American Indian tribes and conservation organizations to prevent the continued killing of Yellowstone buffalo when they exited the park in search of winter forage. In 1985 the Montana legislature had authorized the issuance of buffalo hunting licenses to the public for the purpose of killing Yellowstone bison if they attempted winter migration; a federal judge in Montana later upheld the state's power to do so in a suit brought by a wildlife conservation group (Fund for Animals v. Lujan, 794 F. Supp. 1015 (D. Mont. 1991)). But "hunting" bison is hardly as romantic or challenging as it might sound. Given their size, approachability, and usually calm demeanor, hunting most bison requires little more skill than hunting a cow. What does require skill is to kill one quickly and cleanly, with one shot. One of the problems with the public bison hunts of the late 1980s was that many of the "hunters" did not have that skill, resulting in an even gorier public spectacle than the one televised in the winter of 1996-97, when it was department of livestock marksmen rather than weekend sportsmen gunning down bison as they left the park.</page><page sequence="5">November 2000] Page 25 Table 1 Constructing the Bison State Statutory Citation(s) As Wildlife Only Arizona A.R.S. § 17-101.B.2, 3.

Stat. § 11-20-124(1999) In 1995, the State of Montana sued the federal government in an effort to compel control of the Yellowstone herd size and to prevent its winter migration out of the park. The two parties negotiated a settlement which allowed the state department of livestock to continue killing migrating buffalo in "emergency" situations (ITBCv. Babbitt, ibid., p. 1137), and the following winter over a third of the herd was killed. This prompted the suit by the Intertribal Bison Cooperative and the Greater Yellowstone Coalition to enjoin continued implementation of the "Interim Management Plan" and continued killing of the Yellowstone herd. Even though the state was unable to prove that brucellosis had ever actually been transmitted from a bison to a cow, the court nevertheless found that it was within the state's police powers to protect the public health and safety by "removing possibly infected YNP bison that migrate into Montana" (ITBC v. Babbitt, ibid., p. 1136). The court also characterized the history of Table 1 Constructing the Bison State Statutory Citation(s) As Wildlife Only Arizona A.R.S. § 17-101.B.2, 3.

Thus, the ITBC v. Babbitt decision framed the entire dispute as one of the federal government failing to comply with state estray and animal disease control statutes. In short, they had negligent livestock management. Another rationale this court offered for support of the continued destruction of YNP bison by the state was its repetition of the finding of a district court decision in 1991, to the effect that the carrying capacity of Yellowstone National Park for bison is approximately 2,400 animals. This finding made it possible to support the park superintendent's discretion to allow all animals in excess of that number to be destroyed on exiting the park, as YNP's interim management plan negotiated in settlement of the 1995 suit acknowledged the state's authority to do under emergency conditions (Lujan, p. 1018). However, a research report commissioned by the National Academy of Sciences and published in 1998 has determined the winter carrying capacity of Yellowstone to be "about 3,000 bison" (National Research Council 1998). This report also found the risk of bison-to-cattle transmission of brucellosis to be so low as to be unquantifiable. In order for the ITBC court to find the destruction of "excess" animals a reasoned exercise of discretion, therefore, it had to rely on a seven-year-old court decision rather than the latest evidence from the most authoritative governmental source of scientific information. Lastly, the ITBC court upheld the Yellowstone superintendent's Finding of No Significant [environmental] Impact occasioned by the bison kill. Having made this finding relieved the park superintendent of the necessity of preparing an environmental impact statement prior to agreeing to the kill, as would otherwise be required under the National Environmental Policy Act. Just a week earlier, another federal trial court at the opposite end of the country had heard another case raising remarkably similar issues but had reached opposite conclusions on nearly every major point. In Fund for Animals v. Rappaport (27 F. Supp. 2d 8 (D.D.C. 1998)), the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against implemen tation of a bison management plan on federal lands adjoining Grand Teton National Park which would have allowed the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to kill buffalo to control herd size. Two important reasons the court gave for this action were that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act in authorizing the hunt and had likewise failed to demonstrate the likelihood of brucellosis transmission from the Grand Teton herd to neighboring cattle if the bison hunt was not allowed to go forward. In reaching this latter conclusion, the court agreed with the position taken in the National Academy of Sciences study, holding that a remote and speculative possibility of brucellosis transmission was not enough to warrant the bison's destruction. This was in sharp contrast to the Montana U.S. District Court's finding in the ITBC decision that if the state concluded there was a brucellosis threat, that was all that was needed to justify killing bison if they migrated out of Yellowstone. The D.C. District Court in Rappaport also agreed with expert testimony that there was "virtually no risk" of human infection by the disease—again, a different conclusion from the ITBC decision. In both the ITBC and the Rappaport cases, federal agencies were defendants, because in both cases these agencies had entered into intergovernmental agreements authorizing state agencies to kill members of federal wild bison herds on federal lands. At issue in both cases was</page><page sequence="7">November 2000] Page 27 whether the federal agency in question had adequately evaluated the environmental impacts of these kills (NEPA compliance), whether the scientific evidence pertaining to bison-borne brucellosis was sufficient to support the destruction of wild herd members, and the degree of state agency authority over the control of wild bison on federal lands. And in both cases, the federal agencies sided with the states. For the plaintiff groups concerned with the future well being of wild bison in the United States, both agencies failed and are continuing to fail in their responsibility to steward this resource. De-Sacralizing the Bison: Law, Culture, and Identity In the context of wildlife management in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, conflict over cultural beliefs is occurring in multiple dimensions. The most obvious is between the American Indian tribes in the region, who regard animal species such as the buffalo and the wolf both as relatives and as sacred intermediaries to spiritual dimensions of their universe, and commercial livestock operators who see these same animals as direct threats to their own economic survival and way of life. But what has been largely unseen, because of the ways the issues have been framed, is the persistence of powerful conflict between different groups within Euro-American society. Customarily, conflicts between resource extractive industries and environmental conservation groups in American society have been cast as struggles between competing political interest groups, because their contests are usually played out in political or legal arenas. But something far more fundamental is at stake. Environmental conservation groups and western ranching interests experience political and legal conflict in part because they are proceeding from profoundly differing understandings of what the appropriate relationship between humankind and other living creatures ought to be. In this dispute, different groups are seeking to conceptually construct and thus to treat wild bison in radically different ways. If, as Renato Rosaldo (1989:26) asserts, culture "refers broadly to the forms through which people make sense of their lives," and that "all human conduct is culturally mediated," one conclusion to be drawn from the research described here is that the variation in legal constructions of the bison as depicted in Table 1 reflects differing cultural constructions of the same species of animal across these jurisdictions. My own field work in this area1 as well as the study of other recent data gathering on the role of culture in managing the YNP bison herd2 has led me to conclude that among the three principal stakeholder groups featured in this study (American Indian tribes, conservationists, and ranchers), the perception of and relationship to the Yellowstone bison herd on the part of the conservation community more nearly resembles that of the tribes than it does that of the ranchers. This, in turn, is what has led to conservationists and the Inter-Tribal Bison Cooperative making common legal cause in this ongoing controversy. What this suggests is that a much better grasp of the cultural complexities and variations in the bison management conflict is a necessary precondition to federal land managers' ability to make better decisions in the field and federal judges' ability to make better decisions in the courts when reviewing agency actions. "Better" in this context means tribes, ranchers, and conservationists all sensing that the survival of their respective cultural identities as well as the respective herds of homed, hoofed animals they care about so deeply (albeit for different reasons) will be met at a satisfactory threshold level.</page><page sequence="8">Page 28 [PoLAR: Vol. 23, No. 2 A rich ethnographic tradition documents the centrality of the buffalo to the spiritual identity and practices of the Plains tribes (e.g., Brown 1953; Steltenkamp 1993), just as—in contrast— a rich historical record documents nineteenth-century Anglo-American religious teachings depicting wilderness and the wildlife within it as made subordinate to Man by God, and subject to absolute human dominion (Nash 1967). But what is only now beginning to come into focus is a better understanding of the spiritual (if not overtly religious) dimensions of the Euro American conservation movement, and the increasing frequency with which reverence for life arises in the vision statements as well as the advocacy discourse of these groups. Ethnographer Nurit Bird-David (1999) challenges head-on the modernist perspective of animism (i.e., the perception of the sacred or at least the venerable in non-human forms) as a "savage" religion and failed epistemology. Instead, she posits animism as a sophisticated system of relational knowing: humans and their behavior as integral (though not central) to the natural order rather than distinguishable and separate from it. Based on her own and others' historical and contemporary work in this area, she goes on to propose that such intuitive self understanding, which includes seeing oneself as an intersection in a seamless relational network rather than a separate observer/manipulator of "Nature"—may be a much more common human trait than has previously been acknowledged (Bird-David 1999:S79). While others have alternately lauded and derided some contemporary environmental discourse as the "new animism" or the "new anthropomorphism," Bird-David recommends study of this increasingly evident feature of the post-modern environmental movement as an emergent phenomenon which should be taken seriously. She suggests that it would be interesting to compare hunter-gatherers' animism with some current environmental thought. Schools such as deep ecology, social ecology, and eco feminism envisage an all-encompassing moral community constitutive of humans and non-humans. Some radical environmentalists even call for a paradig matic shift in not only our view of nature but our view of the self, for example, from "ego" to "spirit," understood as a self not split but differentiated from others within relationships (Bird-David 1999:S89). Such a shift is precisely what leading environmental author Barry Lopez (much closer to the center than the radical fringe of the contemporary environmental movement) is describing when he writes that "it may be more important now to enter into an ethical and reciprocal relationship with everything around us than to continue to work toward the sort of control of the physical world that, until recently, we have aspired to" (Lopez 1998:1). The essay from which this quotation was taken develops the position that re-establishing personal, relational knowledge of the environment within the macro-cultures of the first world is as critical to long term sustainable human existence on a planetary scale as it has traditionally been to indigenous peoples regionally. In the realm of Western philosophy, Heidegger has described this process of personal, intuitive, extra-rational, relational knowing of the other (whether the "other" is other human beings, other lifeforms, or the entirety of one's surroundings) as "contemplative" thought, as distin guished from "calculative" thought (rational, linear thought, including the scientific method). In the context of indigenous American spirituality, Dennis and Barbara Tedlock find evidence of contemplative, relational knowing in this quotation from Keresan Larry Bird: "You watch, and wait, and listen and the answer will come to you. It's yours then, not like in school." They</page><page sequence="9">November 2000] Page 29 go on to comment, "What we learn in school is never ours; lectures by experts can never produce the light in us which comes when, suddenly and all at once, we know" (Tedlock and Tedlock 1975:xxi). This contrast between contemplative and calculative ways of knowing is one of the principal delineating features between the sacred and the secular in conventional constructions of Western thought, which is why it should come as no surprise that there is growing emphasis on spiritual affinity with nature as a motivating principle among several member organizations in the Greater Yellowstone Coalition. Relational knowledge also features prominently in ways they have described their relationship to the bison in ethnographic research on the subject (see note 2), as well as in court. At around the same time coalition members were focusing public attention on the 1997 YNP bison herd slaughter, Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope acknowledged that, "We discovered a very large number of people in the Sierra Club who in church were closet environmentalists and in the Sierra Club were closet members of their churches. They felt they had to keep these two aspects of their souls separate." At a 1997 Symposium on Religion, Science, and the Environment, he went on to admit, "The environmental movement for the past quarter of a century has made no more profound error than to misunderstand the mission of religion and the churches in preserving the Creation" (Lowy 2000). This focus on relational knowing, in combination with and in some ways indistinguishable from the environmental movement's re-discovery of its nineteenth-century spiritual origins (per the writings of Thoreau and Muir; see Nash 1967), has also begun to gain recognition in the institutions called upon to translate the discourses of cultural self-identification into the language of the law. In Fund for Animals v. Rappaport (27 F. Supp. 2d 8 (D.D.C. 1998); discussed below) the federal judge granted plaintiff conservationists standing based in part on what he termed their desire to "commiserate" with the Grand Teton bison herd. "Commiserate" was an interesting and important choice of words by this judge, in that its standard American English dictionary definition is "to feel or express sorrow or compassion for, to feel or express sympathy, to condole" (Websters' 9th New Collegiate Dictionary 1991:265). These are interpersonal terms, reflective of plaintiffs' assertion of a personal relationship with the Teton bison, and of the court's willingness to recognize this extra rational, relational status to the bison as a grounds for granting conservationists legal standing to advocate on the herd's behalf. Nor is this emphasis on the need for renewed spiritual relationships with nature confined to what detractors have labelled the "new anthropomorphists" of the environmental movement. One of the more significant developments in contemporary American religious affairs has been the 1993 founding of the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, an umbrella organi zation of mainstream religious denominations that disseminates teaching materials on celebra ting the divine in nature and lobbies Congress for more protective environmental legislation. Its member denominations are now beginning to appear as co-plaintiffs and amici in several major lawsuits mandating enforcement of the Endangered Species Act and supporting indigenous peoples in the preservation of sacred sites on public lands (Lowy, ibid.; Burton 2000). I am not arguing that all the conservation groups in the Greater Yellowstone Coalition are imbued with deep relational knowledge and motivated solely by spiritual affinity with the bison; just as I am also not maintaining that none of the ranchers in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem feel a personal affinity with and deep affection for the rural environments in which</page><page sequence="10">Page 30 [PoLAR: Vol. 23, No. 2 they live and work. These two groups are not monolithic, and there is a tenuous continuum of thought within as well as between them. Indeed, in his book Community and the Politics of Place, former Missoula, Montana mayor Daniel Kemmis (1991) maintains that both groups have strong feelings about their relationship to their land and all it holds; they simply see that relationship quite differently and thus try to compel government institutions to act in accor dance with their conflicting visions. But in the words and deeds of advocacy organizations that these groups comprise and support, strikingly different constructions of their respective world views are clearly evident. The construct of the hierarchical Great Chain of Being western settlers inherited from neo Platonists and early Christians, via the New England Calvinists and Latter Day Saints, still dominates much western rural thought and thus lawmaking in the legislatures of many western states (such as the ones that construct bison äs livestock). The purpose of Creation is to serve the needs of Man, and any other environmental policy goal must remain subordinate to that anthropocentric prime directive. In equally clear distinction, among conservation groups in networks such as the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, the growing emphasis on a capacity for relational knowledge of self in-nature, as well as a re-discovered appreciation for the divine in nature, is creating a strik ingly different sense of self-identity among them, as well as a strikingly different moral vision of what ought to be humankind's relationship to the natural world. The Christians among the conservationists are reviewing and re-defining their religion's teachings on the divine in nature, while others in the movement are just as intent on re-discovering and revitalizing the pre-Christian, Acknowledging or Ignoring Cultural Difference in the Courts Whether this state-by-state effort in the American West to culturally and legally reconstruct the bison will succeed depends to a considerable extent on which federal court is handling the issue, and what that court's views are on questions of federalism and cultural pluralism. The ITBC and Rappaport cases discussed earlier provide some dramatically differing perspectives on whether this reconstruction effort is likely to succeed, growing out of their widely varying perspectives on the interests plaintiffs were trying to assert and the relative responsiveness of the federal agencies involved to the assertion of those interests. In the Rappaport case, individual plaintiffs were seeking (and were granted) standing based simply on their desire to see and be among wild bison in their natural habitat. The court noted that the individual plaintiffs "enjoy observing, photographing, and generally commiserating with the animals"; and that to allow a state-organized hunt outside Grand Teton National Park of the sort that had earlier been conducted outside Yellowstone "would cause them [the plain tiffs] to suffer an aesthetic injury" (Rappaport, at 14). This "aesthetic injury" (i.e., severance of connection with the environment's wilderness heritage experienced through contact with its wildlife) was an important enough interest in the view of this court to warrant a preliminary injunction against a state-administered bison "hunt" pending a trial on the issues of compliance with National Environmental Policy Act (through preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement), and on the defendant agencies' ability to carry the burden of proof of demon strating that the threat of bison-to-cattle brucellosis transmission was significant enough to justify the wild buffalo's destruction. In this decision, the judge was clearly unwilling to</page><page sequence="11">November 2000] Page 31 sacrifice the interests of one community of interest for the sake of another's—at least not until all the facts were in. Neither the plaintiffs nor the bison fared so well in the ITBC decision. Both the Inter-Tribal Bison Cooperative and the National Wildlife Federation are member organizations of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition (although the ITBC is always careful to distinguish its own cultural interests from other member organizations). While the two organizations' respective reasons for participating in this legal action differed in some important regards, they have acknowledged shared interest in one common outcome: that Yellowstone's wild bison herd be treated with respect in the way it is managed (Torbit and Heckert 1999), to the extent that some form of management is needed at all. It was precisely this "aesthetic sensibility"—a cultural interest in conservation and management of the Yellowstone bison as free, wild animals—that the ITBC court went out of its way to declare as non-existent. Two years before eventually dismissing the case, at the outset of this litigation the court denied preliminary injunctive relief to plaintiff Indian tribes and the Greater Yellowstone Coalition. It held that there were no "environmental, emotional, and aesthetic interests" on the plaintiffs' part that would be irreparably injured by allowing the state bison slaughter to continue until a trial could be held on the merits (Greater Yellowstone Coalition et al. v. Babbitt, 952 F.Supp. 1435, 1445 (D.Mont. 1996)). The judge went on to observe that even if the National Park Service decided to manage the bison within Yellowstone National Park exactly as if they were a herd of cattle, it was within that agency's discretion to do so, and there was little either the tribes or the conservationists could do about it. Two years later, in dismissing the case by granting the defendant federal and state government agencies' motion for summary judgment, the same judge found that, to the extent that the tribes and conservationists actually had "aesthetic, emotional, religious, and cultural interests" at stake concerning Yellowstone's wild bison herd, they would be unaffected by the continued destruction of brucellosis-positive bison until such time as the National Park Service and the State of Montana came up with a different approach to the problem (ITBC v. Babbitt, at 1140). Thus, in this case, the court's failure to recognize the role of religious and cultural significance of wild bison to either the indigenes or the conservationists was an important and ultimately discriminatory act of cultural disregard, as well as an open-ended future death warrant for all brucellosis-positive bison in Yellowstone National Park who have the misfortune to follow their instincts down out of the high country in a winter migration. In terms of cultural pluralism in American society, the federal courts clearly have the authority either to accommodate or to subordinate the culture-based interests being advocated before them. It is perhaps not surprising that a federal judge in the heart of cattle country and the American West's historic ranching-based aura of self-identity chose the latter, while another judge in the District of Columbia chose the former. But as the concluding section of this article suggests, perhaps both the nation's remaining wild bison and the various groups affected by their status would benefit from a more comprehensive, culturally-informed, and accom modative approach to the issue than simply depending on a roll of the dice as to which judges in which federal courts around the country will be called upon to address these issues. The Bison's Path, Part 2—Alternative Futures At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were sixty million buffalo in the United States; by its end, there were barely a thousand. Like so many species before, it seemed that</page><page sequence="12">Page 32 [PoLAR: Vol. 23, No. 2 human "progress" was inexorably herding them over the cliff of extinction. But their plight roused the conscience of Congress, and a federal poaching statute in combination with wild herd augmentation by concerned stewards opened up another path for the bison, away from the brink of oblivion. This rescue so thoroughly embodied the nation's newfound commitment to preserving its endangered natural heritage that the American bison's likeness became the centerpiece of the official emblem of the Department of the Interior. What irony, for a bureau cracy whose own icon celebrates it proudest conservation achievement now to be assenting to its degradation and possible destruction. For multiple forces are once again herding the America's wild bison to the edge of existence. The difference between the threats at either end of this century is that, in the new millennium, extinction may be accomplished not by exterminating the animal, but by genetically and legally transforming it. Many (although not all) commercial livestock operators are doing this in three ways. The first is by selective breeding (and eventually, inevitably, artificial insemi nation) of captive herds, in combination with feed enhancement and various drug supplements. The second is by deliberately inter-breeding buffalo with cattle (as in Texas). The third is by doing everything possible to sharply limit the continued existence of wild herds on federal lands. If these interests have their way—in Congress, in the federal bureaucracy, and in the courts—by the end of the twenty-first century the American buffalo may well have gone the way of the aurochs. As in the caves of Lascaux, the wild bison may linger on in the great seal of the Interior Department and in the remembered religious traditions of the Plains Indians, but it will no longer exist in the flesh anywhere on Earth. But once again, just as at the end of the nineteenth century, another path may have opened, away from oblivion and toward a future of more peaceful co-existence with cattle ranchers, government officials, and other wildlife on the public lands. And just as a hundred years ago, making way for survival of the wild bison will involve a combination of political will, cultural cooperation, and mindful wildlife management. One possibility, admittedly remote in the current Congress, is passage of a federal statute granting wild bison herds the same protection from state slaughter on federal lands that Congress extended to wild horses and burros a generation ago. Surely this ancient icon, so central to the religions of America's indigenous peoples for the last ten thousand years, deserves the same measure of respect and protection as the imported feral livestock that got away from Spanish soldiers and gringo prospectors one to three hundred years ago. Short of legislative protection, the same goal of assuring the continued viability of wild bison herds could be accomplished if federal agencies simply managed more assertively and protec tively the wild bison entrusted to their care. There is no shortage of national public support for such an approach, even if there is sometimes intense local political opposition. In 1998, the Interior Department released its draft environmental impact statement on future management of the Yellowstone herd, several options within which included continuation of state destruction of bison on federal land; the state's preferred option including the killing of bison within the park itself. By the fall of that year, however, the department had received 67,000 comments on the DEIS, over 47,000 of which rejected all of its options in favor of an alter native "Citizens' Plan to Save Yellowstone Buffalo." The plan was crafted under the leadership of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, one of the unsuccessful plaintiffs in ITBC v. Babbitt, the Montana federal district court decision upholding the continued destruction of Yellowstone</page><page sequence="13">November 2000] Page 33 buffalo until the EIS and long-term management plan are finalized. As of this writing, the draft plan and its Citizens' Plan alternative remain "under consideration." Whether or not the danger of brucellosis transmission to cattle is "remote and speculative," the fear of it among cattle ranchers grazing herds on lands bordering Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks is very real. Bison can harbor the brucellosis pathogen but generally are not as seriously affected by the disease, which can devastate whole herds of cattle. While there is no reliable vaccine against brucellosis in bison, an effective one does exist for the protection of cattle. In an effort to make their proposed management alternative more acceptable to ranchers, in the spring of 1999 the National Wildlife Federation started offering free brucellosis vacci nations to any of the cattle herds being grazed within fifty miles of the Yellowstone herd if they exit the park. Whether this gesture will be enough to build support for—or at least lessen opposition to—the Citizens' Alternative among Montana's political leaders, state agency officials, and ranchers remains to be seen. In drawing up its final Environmental Impact Statement on wild bison management in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, it will be incumbent on the U.S. Department of the Interior to put forth a great deal more effort than it has up until now to fully document the anticipated social and cultural impacts of the various management alternatives it is contemplating. That the National Park Service has up to now has been so willing to cooperate with the Montana Department of Livestock in the capture and killing of possibly brucellosis-positive wild bison at the entrance to Yellowstone bespeaks a relative lack of attention to this dimension of the problem, at least insofar as the impact on neighboring Indian tribes and the conservationist community is concerned. In a different realm altogether, more attention must be devoted to the general cultural compe tence of the federal judiciary, whether it be by those on the trial bench reflecting on their intended actions, by higher courts reviewing trial court decision making, or by those members of the executive and legislative branches involved in the judicial appointment process. For a judge to rule that the religious interests of neighboring Indian tribes will be unaffected by the state slaughter of wild bison at Yellowstone's north gate is akin to telling orthodox Jews that their religious interests will be unaffected by the presence of anti-Semitic graffiti on Jerusalem's Wailing Wall. There is probably no more profound act of desecration to the living religion of the Plains Indians than the state actions the court is condoning at Yellowstone; and to pretend this is not the case is to ignore one of the American West's most enduring—if painful—cultural realities. Many Indian leaders are now coming to see that their tribes' future cultural survival and the wild bison's physical survival are intimately related, which accounts in large part for the growing number of reservations now hosting their own wild bison populations. Herd size and management approach vary, depending on reservation conditions and tribal leadership decision making. In this effort, they have found common cause with the conservation community, which sees the survival of wild, free bison as essential to the ability of Euro-Americans to learn from their own environmental mistakes. Archeological evidence suggests that pre-Christian Europeans once revered animals such as the aurochs in somewhat the same way that contemporary indigenous peoples of the United States still regard the bison. As ethnographers (such as Bird-David) and paleobiologists (such as Paul Shepard 1998) alike are suggesting, if we look far enough back in time, we may</page><page sequence="14">Page 34 [PoLAR; Vol. 23, No. 2 discover that the deepest roots of Euro-American and indigenous American cultures are less different than we have traditionally been led to believe. At a 1999 convocation of Inter-Tribal Bison Cooperative leadership, ITBC co-founder and Wind River Sioux herd manager Fred duBray emphasized the similarities between the historic treatment of his people by the Euro-American culture, and the plans of some western ranchers for the future of the bison. He reflected on how Indian children had been taken from their families hundreds of miles away to missionary and government boarding schools, forbidden their own culture, and force-fed the dominant one. "They tried to kill the Indian while saving the red man," he observed. "Now they want to kill the buffalo while keeping the meat alive." In that reflection, he was giving contemporary Sioux voice to views shared by American nature philosophers from Henry David Thoreau to Gary Snyder: a sense that the roots of our environ mental crisis lie in the Euro-American culture's historic efforts to dissociate the spirit from the flesh, the scientific from the sacred, and the wise from the wild. Perhaps that last aurochs did not actually die without purpose, and the lesson of its passing will not be lost after all. Perhaps all of us sharing stewardship of public lands and resources—our national commons—can come to understand that it is actually quite an honor to have in our midst an unbroken lineage of ten-thousand-year-old wild animals on whose existence the survival of entire human populations once depended. Preservation of wild bison is clearly and closely linked to the cultural survival of lineage descendants of those ancient indigenous peoples. Perhaps, in ways we are just now coming to appreciate, it is linked almost as closely to the cultural identity of Euro-American peoples as well. Notes My earliest life experience with this study subject came at the age of 6, when my mother killed a buffalo with one clean shot in a federally supervised hunt at Ft. Huachuca, Arizona. Being a family of very modest means, we subsisted off that animal for nearly a year. Later, as a teenager, I found spring and summer work on one of the few remaining ranches in Pima County, Arizona. During 1998 and 1999, I attended convocations of the Inter-Tribal Bison Cooperative in northern Colorado, where I made note of proceedings and interviewed tribal herd managers on the role bison were playing in the revivification of their traditional cultural practices and teachings. During this period, by invitation I also attended ceremonial obser vances on some ITBC-member reservations. Interview material was also gathered during several conversations in 1998 and 1999 with Steven Torbit, Ph.D., director of the Bison Recovery Program of the National Wildlife Federation, Boulder, Colorado field office. During 1999,1 served as a consultant for the Social Science Division of the National Park Service, in the capacity of peer reviewer for comparative ethnographic work then being conducted (including interviews with respondents from all three stakeholder groups which are the subject of this article), preparatory to issuance of Yellowstone National Park's Bison Management Plan. As of this writing, this work remains in unpublished draft manuscript form, still undergoing review, amendment, and augmentation.</page><page sequence="15">November 2000] Page 35 References Cited Bird-David, Nurit 1999 "Animism Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology."
