<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CONCLUSION We are now in position to draw together the main results of this study and  clarify how Ibn Taymiyya is similar to and different from others in the Islamic  tradition. What emerges out of the shaykh’s sundry theodicean writings is an  optimism that is consistent but not always fully worked out. Over against  Ash≠arī voluntarism and the Mu≠tazilī free-will theodicy, Ibn Taymiyya main- tains that God in His perfection creates everything in existence, human acts  included, according to His wise purpose and, ultimately, in the best possible  way. This places Ibn Taymiyya in the company of Ibn Sīnā, al-Ghazālī in his  I!hyā±, and Ibn ≠Arabī on the central theological question of theodicy, even  as he differs with these figures on other key matters. Ibn Taymiyya’s optimism is readily apparent in discussions linked to the  first type of his three-fold evil attribution typology examined in Chapter Five.  To review these three types briefly, the first attributes evil to the generality  of God’s creation. The second type ascribes evil to the creature or second- ary cause. The third type is the rhetorical courtesy of eliding the agent of  evil—presumably God—and putting the relevant verb in the passive voice;  Ibn Taymiyya’s discussion of this type is limited to citing examples from  the Qur±an. Attribution of evil to the generality, the first type, is understood in three  ways in Ibn Taymiyya’s discourse, each clearly echoing Ibn Sīnā. First, evil is  harmful only to particular persons while being to the greater benefit of the  whole. Everything that God creates, both good and evil, is good by virtue of  His wise purpose. Ibn Taymiyya supports this with quranic verses such as,  “Who made good everything He created” (Q. 32:7), and “We did not cre- ate the heavens and the earth and what is between them except with truth”  (Q. 15:85), and the hadith, “Good is in Your hands, and evil is not [attrib- uted] to You.” In texts examined in Chapter Six, the shaykh also speaks of  the goodness of all that God creates in terms of God’s justice (≠adl) that puts  everything in its place. Justice in this sense does not indicate pure retribution  but God’s wise purpose and beneficence in creation. Second, evil is intrinsic to the perfection of some things. In Jabr Ibn  Taymiyya explains that God is subject to logical constraints. God cannot  create the impossible, and God in creating good must also create the evil that  is necessarily concomitant to it. The shaykh then implies that God creates  the best world that He can with an assertion of the necessary perfection  © Jon Hoover, 2007  This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/. </page> <page sequence="2"> 230 conclusion of God’s attributes of wisdom, power and mercy. He makes this optimism  explicit in ≠Ādil, a text dealing with God’s justice, by rooting God’s creation  of the best possible world in the exigencies of God’s perfection and gener- osity and endorsing al-Ghazālī’s aphorism, “There is nothing in possibility  more wonderful than what is.” Lest this imply limitation to God’s power  and freedom, Ibn Taymiyya affirms that God can do other than what He  in fact does. Third, and finally, attributing evil to the generality means that evil is  quantitatively insignificant. The shaykh notes in (Hasana, for example, that  the Messenger brought great profit even though some were killed in the  course of his mission. At times, Ibn Taymiyya states that God’s wise purpose in the creation  of evil cannot be known and that it is only important to believe that God  has a wise purpose in all that He does. At other times, however, he does  specify that evil has particular educational or religious benefits for human  beings, which echo similar notions in Mu≠tazilism and Sufism. The un-  belief and destruction of Pharaoh, for example, serve as a lesson and a  deterrent against tempting the same fate. Illness and sin provide occasions  for humble turning to God that would not be possible otherwise. Oppres- sion under an unjust ruler expiates sins and motivates turning to God to  ask forgiveness. Even though Ibn Taymiyya supplies educational and religious reasons for  evil, he does not exploit two other explanations for evil adopted by some  Muslim optimists. First, unlike al-Ghazālī, Ibn Taymiyya does not explain  that evil is necessary for knowledge in the sense that things are known only  by their opposites. For al-Ghazālī, health is known through illness and the  blessing of Paradise from the punishment of Hell. Second, unlike Ibn ≠Arabī,  Ibn Taymiyya does not readily invoke the principle of plenitude, which  maintains that evil is necessary in order for God to display the full diversity  of His names and attributes. The principle of plenitude would seem to be  inherent in a fully worked out best-of-all-possible-worlds theodicy, and Ibn  Taymiyya does suggest that creation reflects the diversity of God’s names. As  already noted, he even goes so far as to say that sin leads to good things not  otherwise possible. However, the shaykh does not say explicitly, as does his  disciple Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, that God is dependent upon the existence  of human sin and disobedience for the exercise of some of His attributes,  and he does not explore and elaborate the paradoxical interplay of God’s  attributes in the fashion of Ibn ≠Arabī. Rather, he is greatly concerned to  avoid implicating God in evil and so affirms the complete goodness of all  of God’s names and attributes. </page> <page sequence="3">  conclusion 231 With regard to the second type in Ibn Taymiyya’s evil attribution typol- ogy—the attribution of evil to the creature—it seems probable that there  was development in his thinking. In several texts, as in Minhāj for example,  the shaykh establishes a basis for retribution with the principle that acts are  attributed not to their Creator but to the human substrate in which they  are created. With this, God is just to reward and punish the human deeds  that He creates. This way of explaining the origin of sin and evil is more  at home in the world of Kalām theology than in a full orbed best-of-all-  possible-worlds theodicy. Also, it implies that God is ultimately responsible  for bad acts insofar as He creates them. In (Hasana, which contains Ibn Taymiyya’s fullest discussion of evil, he  goes beyond the substrate principle to root evil in nonexistence (≠adam)—a  notion employed by Ibn Sīnā and Ibn ≠Arabī for metaphysical and mystical  ends, respectively—to strengthen the foundations of retributive punish- ment by clearing God of responsibility for creating human disobedience.  Ibn Taymiyya claims in (Hasana that two affirmations in Q. 4:78–9 are not  contradictory: “Everything is from God,” and, “Any evil thing that comes  to you is from yourself.” To make sense of this, he traces the origin of bad  human acts back to the failure of humans to do that for which they were  created. This failure is a lack which is by definition nonexistent, and so God  is not responsible for it. The evil deeds that God creates are then retribution  for this initial failure, while good deeds come strictly from God’s unmerited  grace and blessing, having no ground in human virtue and achievement.  When faced with the question of why some people are created more prone  to initial failure than others, the shaykh falls back on God’s wise purpose in  the creation of all things. In Fāti!ha, which is likely a later treatise, Ibn Taymiyya similarly upholds  retributive punishment for evil deeds but drops retributive reward for good  deeds. He asserts that the blessings of good deeds, their rewards, and entry  into Paradise have no basis in human merit but occur strictly by the grace  of God. God is the only source of all good, and, in this case, piety calls  for acknowledging God’s grace for all good while maintaining full human  responsibility for all evil, which arises ultimately from nonexistence. Going beyond the interpretation of good and evil, Ibn Taymiyya uses  ideas found also in Ibn Sīnā to make sense of God’s self-sufficiency. At the  core of the shaykh’s theodicy is a causal model of God’s wisdom. God acts  on account of causes, which are His wise purposes. To Ash≠arī Kalām theolo- gians, this implies that God is perfected by acting on account of a cause and  was imperfect beforehand. This compromises God’s sufficiency apart from  the world. Both Ash≠arī and Mu≠tazilī Kalām theologians seek to avoid this  </page> <page sequence="4"> 232 conclusion problem with the doctrine of God’s creation of the world in time ex nihilo.  This assures that God is fully God apart from the world by positing a point  at which the world did not in fact exist. The Mu≠tazilīs still try to affirm that  God creates the world for purposes, purposes that benefit the world only and  have no impact on God. But the Ash≠arīs—and Ibn Taymiyya—reject the  Mu≠tazilī solution as irrational. Ibn Taymiyya affirms fully that God acts in  a rationally self-interested sense for the sake of His own wise purpose. This  strongly suggests that God needs creation in order to work out His wise  purposes and manifest His perfection. To meet this objection, Ibn Taymiyya  employs the Avicennan notion that God’s love for Himself is essential while  the world is an accidental and secondary—even if necessary—product of  God’s self-love. Even though there has always been a world, this does not  mean that God would be less fully God without it. Ibn Taymiyya argues as  well that God is sufficient apart from the world inasmuch as He needs no  help in creating all that exists. Creatures have no impact on God since it is  God Himself who creates their acts. While both Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Sīnā posit God’s origination of the  world as necessary, they differ on a key point. For Ibn Sīnā, this world is a  necessary emanation of the eternal and timeless essence of God. Ibn Taymiyya  responds that positing the world as the effect of a timeless and motionless  First Cause completely precludes movement in the world, which manifestly  contradicts our experience of events originating in time. To overcome this  problem, Ibn Taymiyya rejects the timeless ideal of God’s perfection and  introduces movement into both God and the world. He also discards Ibn  Sīnā’s emanation cosmology and replaces it with God’s voluntary, but per- petual, creativity. For Ibn Taymiyya, it is of the necessary concomitants of  God’s perfection and essence that He act and create by means of His will and  power from eternity. Putting it more succinctly, God creates voluntarily by  necessity. Ibn Taymiyya does not normally speak of time or originating events  subsisting in God’s essence. Rather he speaks of the perpetual dynamism of  God in terms of God’s voluntary attributes and acts, whose ongoing exercise  according to God’s wise purpose brings about their effects in the temporally  created world, and, even though God could do other than what He does,  what God does create at each point in time is the best possible for that time.  With respect to creation itself, Ibn Taymiyya denies that anything in the  world is eternal. Each individual created thing is preceded by nonexistence  in time. Yet, there have always been created things, and the genus or species  of created things is eternal. Ibn Taymiyya’s conciliation between the providentially necessitating God  of Ibn Sīnā and the dynamic, personal and historically involved God found in  </page> <page sequence="5">  conclusion 233 his plain language reading of the Qur±an and Hadith is unusual and possibly  unprecedented in the Islamic tradition. The shaykh achieves this conciliation  by abandoning the ancient Greek philosophical ideal shared by medieval  Kalām theologians, Muslim philosophers and philosophically-minded Sufis  alike that the ultimate perfection of God consists in unchanging and motion- less eternity. The perpetual and voluntary activity that is both necessary and  essential to God’s perfection is what most fundamentally distinguishes Ibn  Taymiyya’s optimism from the optimisms of Ibn Sīnā, Ibn ≠Arabī, al-Ghazālī  and their like. When Ibn Taymiyya turns his attention to the relation of God’s action  to human action and accountability, he is most concerned to distinguish  the two spheres clearly and give each its full due. That is, God is Creator of  all existents including human acts, and human beings freely choose and are  accountable for the deeds that they commit. The shaykh rejects any attempt  to resolve the tension between these two spheres by limiting God’s power on  the one hand (Qadarīs and Mu≠tazilīs) or limiting human responsibility on  the other (Sufi antinomianism and theologies such as those of al-Juwaynī and  Ibn ≠Arabī that allegedly undergird it). He also denies that the two spheres  are contradictory, and he is unsympathetic to Ibn ≠Arabī’s understanding of  reality as fundamentally paradoxical and ambiguous. As shown in Chapter Three, the shaykh uses his divine action/human  accountability or creation/command hermeneutic to bring order and sense  to a wide array of quranic and theological terms. On the side of creation are  also God’s determination, decree and ontological words, while on the side of  command are God’s love, good pleasure, and legislative and religious words.  Parallel to creation and command are also divinity and lordship, inspiration  and piety/immorality (Q. 91:7–8). In this last set of terms, inspiration indi- cates creation, and the contrast between piety and immorality corresponds  to legislation, that is, command and prohibition. Moreover, a number of  quranic terms such as will, judgment, writing and authorization carry an  ontological, determinative sense in some instances and a legislative or religious  sense in others. At times, Ibn Taymiyya finds it necessary to clarify that terms  often associated with one sphere may carry senses appropriate to the other,  as when he specifies—against Ibn ≠Arabī—that ‘decree’ carries a legislative  sense in the verse, “Your Lord has decreed that you serve none but Him”  (Q. 17:23). The shaykh’s concern throughout is to undermine interpretations  that he believes lead to antinomianism, especially al-Juwaynī’s equation of  God’s love with God’s ontological will. It is particularly in Minhāj, writing against the Mu≠tazilī polemic of  the Shī≠ī Ibn al-Mu$tahhar al-(Hillī, that Ibn Taymiyya seeks to defend the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 234 conclusion plausibility of adhering fully to both creation and command by offering  illustrations from human affairs. In one type of illustration, Ibn Taymiyya  observes that God may will to create what opposes His command for the  sake of something else—some wise purpose—that He loves, as when a sick  person takes medicine to attain health. In another kind of illustration, the  shaykh distinguishes the will of an agent to perform an act himself (creation)  and his will that someone else perform an act (command). He observes,  moreover, that an agent may have a wise purpose in commanding someone  to do something without helping him to do it, as for example in the quranic  story of the one who advised Moses to flee but did not help Moses in order  to avoid detriment to himself (Q. 28:20). While Ibn Taymiyya recognizes  that such examples do not apply perfectly to God, he argues that, if it is  possible that commanding but not helping is at times wise for creatures,  such wise intentions are a fortiori possible for God. Ibn Taymiyya’s creation/command hermeneutic extends as well into his  treatment of the human act. On the creation side, God creates a power,  capability, decisive will or some combination thereof in the human being to  necessitate or preponderate the existence of the human act. This view of God’s  creation of the human act by means of power or will is essentially that of  Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī. Its roots lie in the preponderance (tarjī!h) terminology  of the Mu≠tazilīs and in Ibn Sīnā’s language of causality, but neither al-Rāzī  nor Ibn Taymiyya subscribe to a causal chain theory into which God cannot  intervene. Both al-Rāzī and Ibn Taymiyya dismiss the early Ash≠arī doctrine  of acquisition (kasb) as meaningless. Yet, while al-Rāzī openly identifies his  view as compulsion ( jabr), the shaykh wishes not to speak of compulsion lest  it be confused with coercion (ikrāh), which nullifies human will and choice  entirely. For Ibn Taymiyya, God cannot be said to coerce because He creates  the will and free choice by which human beings act voluntarily. Corresponding to the realm of command is the human power or capability  that is anterior to God’s creation of the act and constitutes the bodily sound- ness rendering a human being accountable to God’s legislation. Similarly,  on the side of command and human action are the secondary causes, which  include, among other things, God’s guidance and the human will. From this  perspective, humans live in a predictable world of apparently natural causes  and conditions, and involuntary human acts are distinguished from voluntary  acts inasmuch as the latter come into existence by means of the human will.  However, God can break the natural order of the causes whenever He wills,  and, from the side of God’s creation, it is God who employs the secondary  </page> <page sequence="7">  conclusion 235 causes as instruments and raw materials according to His wise purposes to  originate all that occurs. Al-Rāzī sometimes maintains the compatibility of God’s preponderance or  creation of the human act with human accountability, but at least once—in  his Tafsīr—he rigorously spells out how they contradict one another. By way  of contrast, Ibn Taymiyya consistently denies contradiction between God’s  determination of the human act and human free choice, and on occasion  he presents their compatibility as the golden mean between the extremes of  compulsion ( jabr) and denying God’s all-comprehensive power. Neverthe- less, he does encounter rational difficulties. In response, he simply affirms  that God has a wise purpose in all that He creates, or he diverts his reader’s  attention from the divine perspective to the human. A clear example of the  latter is his response to al-Rāzī’s claim that God obligates humans to do the  impossible. Al-Rāzī argues that God obligated Abū Lahab to do the impos- sible when God commanded him to believe because God’s foreknowledge  necessitated that he not believe. Although Ibn Taymiyya cannot deny that  this is so metaphysically, he sidesteps al-Rāzī’s conclusion by switching to  the human ethical perspective in which belief was indeed obligatory for Abū  Lahab. Moreover, the shaykh argues, God did not inform Abū Lahab that  He already knew that he would not believe. From the above, it is apparent that Ibn Taymiyya’s theodicean writings  constitute a concerted attempt to exegete and rationalize the relevant texts  in the Qur±an and the Hadith into a consistent perpetual optimism in theo- dicy and compatibilism in the human act. In order better to understand the  underpinnings of this, Chapter One sought out texts beyond the theodicean  writings that provided clues to Ibn Taymiyya’s theological methodology.  This showed that Ibn Taymiyya’s theological work may be characterized as  a juristic exercise dedicated to finding the most praiseworthy way to speak  about God and that this is part of the shaykh’s wider practical and juristic  effort to ascertain how correctly to worship God in all aspects of life. Basic  to Ibn Taymiyya’s theological jurisprudence is the principle—grounded both  in rational considerations of causality and in the quranic verse, “To God  is the highest similitude” (Q. 16:60)—that God has an a fortiori right to  ascription with the highest human perfections and to exoneration from all  imperfections. With this principle in place, Ibn Taymiyya affirms the full  reality of all attributes ascribed to God in the Qur±an and the Hadith, while  also affirming that both God’s perfection and the verse, “There is nothing like  Him” (Q. 42:11), dictate that the modalities of these attributes be wholly  </page> <page sequence="8"> 236 conclusion unlike those of creatures. Within this framework, the shaykh explicates the  significance, coherence and faithfulness to tradition of his plain language  reading of the theological data in the revealed texts, and he makes and seeks  to demonstrate the apologetic claim that independent reason rightly exercised  leads to speaking about God in the same way. Ibn Taymiyya’s approach to God’s attributes and theological language  differs from a number of others in the Islamic tradition. Unlike the Kalām  theologians, the shaykh sees no need to reinterpret corporeal attributes  such as God’s hand and God’s sitting to give them meanings allegedly more  fitting to God. He typically tries to interpret God’s attributes according  to their linguistic and contextual senses and to show how these meanings  fit together. He avoids anthropomorphism by maintaining that it is of the  perfection of God’s perfection that all of God’s attributes be wholly unlike  their counterparts in creatures, except in name. In contrast to the Muslim  philosophers and Ibn ≠Arabī, Ibn Taymiyya’s approach is also distinctively  egalitarian. Unlike the philosophers, he does not draw a distinction between  a superior intellectual apprehension of the truth by the elite on the one hand  and the imaginal reports of God’s messengers adapted for easy apprehen- sion by the inferior masses on the other. And while Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn  ≠Arabī share in rejecting Kalām reinterpretation (ta±wīl) of God’s corporeal  attributes, the (Hanbalī jurist distinguishes himself from the Sufi theorist  by drawing a sharp line between the Creator and the creature. He affirms  the ontological reality of God’s names and attributes, leaves no room for  the illumined gnostic to see created things as God’s very acts, and refrains  from esoteric interpretation. Additionally, Ibn Taymiyya breaks with the  unreflective traditionalism of H( anbalī forbears such as Ibn Qudāma. Instead,  he engages in interpretation of the meanings of God’s attributes and makes  the apologetic claim that his views accord with reason. For Ibn Taymiyya,  reason and revelation lead to the same truth, and this truth about God is  equally available to all ordinary people of right mind. With the basic elements of Ibn Taymiyya’s apologetic theological jurispru- dence in view, his theodicy provides an important case study in its imple- mentation. Here, several features of his methodology become apparent. The  quranic and rational imperative to ascribe to God the highest perfection or  similitude means avoiding terms that may carry negative connotations in  ordinary speech and/or whose usage is not required by revelation. Thus, Ibn  Taymiyya speaks not of purpose (ghara#d) but of wise purpose (!hikma), not  of compulsion ( jabr) but of creating and making ( ja≠l), and not of originat- ing events in God’s essence but of God’s voluntary attributes and acts, this  even though the respective terms mean the same thing metaphysically. More  </page> <page sequence="9">  conclusion 237 substantively, giving God the highest similitude involves Ibn Taymiyya in  clarifying the characteristics of God’s perfection and identifying why compet- ing theodicies are wrong. With reason and the revealed tradition interpreted  by the Salaf as his stated authorities, the shaykh takes God’s perfection to  consist in willing and creating things in the world for wise purposes from  eternity in the best possible way. He criticizes the Mu≠tazilīs and the Ash≠arīs  for failing, each in their own way, to ascribe to God the highest similitude  or perfection. The imperative to ascribe perfection to God also entails a  rationalism for Ibn Taymiyya that seeks to resolve or at least find plausible  ways to understand rational difficulties such as the origin of evil and the  conundrum of creation and command. In the end, Ibn Taymiyya’s best-of-all-possible-worlds theodicy is testimony  to a deep conviction that proper worship of God requires making laudable  sense out of the revealed tradition and showing that this accords with rea- son. His perpetual optimism constitutes an apologetic rationalization of a  close ordinary language reading of what Islam’s foundational texts say about  God’s moral relationship to the world. The present study has been devoted  primarily to elucidating the contours of this apologetic rationalization and  showing how it works. This hopefully sets the stage for further exploration  in three directions. First, other aspects of Ibn Taymiyya’s theology await more  detailed exposition and analysis, especially his doctrine of God’s attributes  surveyed in Chapter One. Second, much work remains to clarify how Ibn  Taymiyya appropriated the thought of those he read, especially Ibn Sīnā, Ibn  ≠Arabī and Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, as well as Ibn Rushd and Abū al-Barakāt  al-Baghdādī. The latter two figures have received comparatively little atten- tion in this study, but they may well be no less important to Ibn Taymiyya’s  intellectual formation. Third, the strong modern interest in Ibn Taymiyya  warrants extensive research into how and why his theodicy, and his theology  more generally, have been appropriated by successors, both late-medieval  and modern. It seems likely that Ibn Taymiyya’s egalitarian and non-esoteric  approach to interpretation combined with his rationalization of the theologi- cal evidence in Islam’s source texts is one reason many Muslims have been  drawn to him in the rationalistic and egalitarian age of modernity. </page> <page sequence="10">  </page> </plain_text>
