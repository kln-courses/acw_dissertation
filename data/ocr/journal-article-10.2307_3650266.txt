AMBLER AND SIR KENNETH MURRAY, F.R.S. Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, University ofEdinburgh, Darwin Building, King's Buildings, Mayfield Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JR, UK Martin Rivers Pollock was born in Liverpool on 10 December 1914. He came from an old legal family, being the great-great-grandson of Sir Jonathan Frederick Pollock, Bt. (1783-1870), a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, barrister, MP for Huntingdon, Attorney General in Peel's first administration and Chief Baron of the Exchequer from 1844 to 1866. His father, Hamilton Rivers Pollock, also went to Trinity College, qualified as a barrister but never practised, and in 1914 was with the Cunard Steam Ship Company, before spending World War I with the Liverpool Regiment and the Royal Air Force. His mother was Eveline Morton Bell, daughter of Thomas Bell, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. After the war his father inherited a fortune from an uncle, and the family moved to Wessex, where they lived first at splendid Anderson Manor, Dorset, and then Urchfont Manor, Wiltshire, his father living as a country squire and JP. Pollock had a conventional upper-class education, beginning with a nanny, followed by West Downs School (1923-28) and then Winchester College (1928-33). His first scientific enthusiasm was for astronomy, but he decided he was insufficiently mathematical to pursue it further (his mathematics master was Clement Durrell, author of some famous texts including Advanced algebra), so he then decided to study medicine. His Wessex schooldays were influ- enced by the nearby Powys brothers, the youngest (Llewelyn') having been a Cambridge friend and contemporary of his father. Through Sylvia Townsend Warner2 he met her cousin Janet, daughter of Arthur Llewelyn Machen3, who eventually, in 1979, became his second wife. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1933, having done his first MB and the first part of his second MB while still at school, and opting to do the two new half-subjects (Pathology and Biochemistry) that had just been instituted-he remembered thinking at the time that biochemistry was going to be the key subject for medicine in the future. Already while at school he had become a theoretical Communist, and as an undergraduate worked very 359 ? 2002 The Royal Society</page><page sequence="4">360 Biographical Memoirs hard, both at his medical studies and in political activity (such as selling the Daily Worker) for the Party-and knew most of the soon-to-be notorious Cambridge Communists of the time, including Guy Burgess4 and Donald Maclean5. He was now a Senior Scholar, and graduated BA first class in 1936; he started to spend a fourth year reading Part II Biochemistry. He decided in April 1937 that he had spent too long at Cambridge, so moved on to his clinical studies at University College Hospital. He also felt he should try to become qualified before what he saw as the inevitable war started, although he was nearly distracted into joining the International Brigade and going off to Spain-he had been a friend of John Comford6, who did go to Spain and wrote and died there, and of Norman John (but widely known as James) Klugmann. A CAREER IN MEDICINE OR SCIENCE? Pollock spent a last wintry family Christmas at Urchfont Manor in 1939, during the phoney war. In June 1940, just after Dunkirk, both his parents died while he was doing his house jobs in London and expecting the hospitals to be inundated with casualties from the Blitz. He was now with Jean Paradise, a talented pianist, whom he married later in the year. During his time in London, Pollock concluded that he was not cut out for clinical work, but had already dis- covered a fascination for investigation, and the more academic side of medical science. So instead of joining the Royal Army Medical Corps, Pollock contacted friends who were already working with the Emergency Public Health Laboratory Service, which was being run by the Medical Research Council (MRC), and was posted to Leicester in February 1941. The job required giving priority to bacteriology in the isolation hospital-Salmonella and typhoid, diphtheria and haemolytic streptococci-and being prepared for any crises that would result from bacteriological warfare. This left a lot of spare time for research, which was positively encouraged by the MRC, concentrating on trying to understand the rationale for the way in which selective media worked in isolating particular bacteria. This work was at once successful. It was already known that medium containing tetrathion- ate (Na2S406) was effective for the isolation of Salmonella from faeces, but Pollock, Gell and Knox (1)* now realized that Salmonella (but not other coliforms) could reduce the somewhat toxic tetrathionate to the much less toxic thiosulphate (Na2S203), so having selective action. Pollock recognized that the enzyme that reduced tetrathionate was not manifest in the absence of the substrate but became present adaptively when tetrathionate was added (2), and showed that the enzyme was probably formed by adaptation (what is now called induction) in all cells, rather than arising by mutation in a cell line. Pollock became fascinated by this problem, and it proved the beacon for most of his research career. THE WAR YEARS AND INFECTIOUS HEPATITIS After the development of some 4000 cases of jaundice in British troops in the Mediterranean area in 1941-42 and 12 000 cases in 1942-43 as well as a large-scale outbreak among American troops arriving in Northern Ireland in 1942, the MRC appointed a Jaundice * Numbers in this form refer to the bibliography at the end of the text.</page><page sequence="5">Martin Rivers Pollock 361 Committee in 1943 at the request of the Ministry of Health and the War Office. A Jaundice Research Team was formed under the general direction of Professor L.J. Witts that for admin- istrative convenience, and to avoid transmission experiments (in both animals and human vol- unteers) being performed in epidemic areas, was located in the Department of Pathology at Cambridge. After nearly two years with the MRC Group in Leicester, Pollock moved to Cambridge to join the Jaundice Research Team, where he became concerned with the bio- chemistry of liver function and attempts to develop a reliable method for the detection of infectious hepatitis at the subclinical stage (3, 4). In the course of this work he was sent to the Front in Italy to study cases of jaundice in an epidemic affecting the Eighth Army, but all his notes were stolen from the truck in which he was travelling and, in his own words, the mis- sion achieved nothing of significance. However, jaundice was made a notifiable disease in Civil Defence Region 4, which had a population of around 2.5 million, included Cambridge, and provided sufficient clinical material for the Research Team's studies. Pollock's principal objective was essentially to use biochemical analyses to map the course of liver damage in cases of infectious hepatitis. He addressed this through serial measurements of serum bilirubin levels and hippuric acid synthesis in patients with infectious hepatitis, who were usually admitted to hospital within three days of the appearance of jaundice. His com- prehensive analyses included a comparison of the currently used methods for measurement of bilirubin in both serum and urine which showed that, contrary to views held at the time, serum and urine levels were relatively independent. Because liver damage preceded serum bilirubin elevation, the serum level was not a satisfactory index or measure of liver function and so Pollock used the more complex intravenous hippuric acid test, which could only be conve- niently performed on hospitalized patients; this clearly showed a progressive increase towards normal levels of hippuric acid during the course of disease and was accompanied by a regres- sion to normal levels of bilirubin in the serum samples during recovery of the 81 patients in the study group. Overall, the analyses indicated that maximum liver damage most commonly occurred before the admission of patients to hospital in the pre-icteric stage of the disease (i.e. before the onset of jaundice), and that treatment of the disease would remain dependent on accurate biochemical methods for diagnosis early in the pre-icteric stage. Such methods were to await the emergence of antigen-specific antibody reactions and the discovery of a range of specific enzyme reactions associated with liver functions. Further work on infective hepatitis by the Jaundice Research Team (with C. Wilson and A.D. Harris) involved therapeutic trials of methionine and cysteine (5); although these compounds did not progress into routine use, interest in possible applications of derivatives of cysteine in the treatment of serum hepatitis, or hepatitis B as it is now described, has been revived quite recently (Weiss et al. 1998). These and other clinical aspects of his work at Cambridge might well have been the basis of his con- tinuing interest in chemotherapy (16). TWENTY YEARS WITH THE MRC: THE CHEMICAL BACTERIOLOGY UNIT AND MILL HILL At the end of the war Sir Paul Fildes7, F.R.S., invited Pollock to join the MRC Chemical Bacteriology Unit at the Lister Institute, London, and made sure that he would be able to con- tinue studying enzyme adaptation with tetrathionate reductase, nitrate reductase and, later, penicillinase. In the winter of 1946 he made his first visit to the Pasteur Institute in Paris to</page><page sequence="6">362 Biographical Memoirs see A.M. Lwoff (For.Mem.R.S. 1958) and met J.L. Monod (For.Mem.R.S. 1968) for the first time, a visit that confirmed his belief in the importance and potential of his main research fas- cination. Monod arranged an invitation for him to go to the 4th International Congress in Microbiology, Copenhagen, in 1947 (7), where he met S. Spiegelman , another major player in this area, and Max Delbriick, already proselytizing the potentiality of bacteriophage in bac- terial genetics. At Fildes's suggestion Pollock also started to study factors needed for growth of Haemophilus pertussis, and found that growth was inhibited by long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (6, 8). However, he found it difficult to work on two such different projects concurrently, and in summer 1948 had three months' leave at the Pasteur, where he fell firmly under the influence of Monod. Shortly afterwards, Pollock started work on penicillinase, as an enzyme that-like 3-galactosidase, the system being studied intensively in Monod's laboratory--was simple to assay and represented the activity of a single factor. Fildes retired from the directorship of the MRC Chemical Bacteriology Unit in 1949, and Pollock was appointed Acting Director. The group soon moved to the new National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) at Mill Hill, and he became Head of the Division of Bacterial Physiology (1949-65), although in a position of less authority than in a separate Unit, with Sir Charles Harrington8 as Director of the Institute. P.B. (later Sir Peter) Medawar9, F.R.S., became Director of the NIMR in 1962. Busy from now on with the Bacillus cereus penicilli- nase system (9-13), Pollock spent 1952-53 at the Pasteur, with Monod's influence becoming even stronger. The long-standing ambition of understanding biology in chemical terms was now rapidly becoming reality, because F. Sanger (F.R.S. 1954) had shown that each protein has a unique structure, and J.D. Watson (For.Mem.R.S. 1981) and F.H.C. (later Sir Francis) Crick (F.R.S. 1959) had deduced the feature of DNA structure that enabled it to function as the genetic mate- rial, and much of intermediary metabolism had been worked out. However, the way in which proteins were synthesized and biological functions were controlled remained a mystery. The most attractive systems for study were bacterial or fungal 'adaptive enzymes', enzymes that were not synthesized continually but were made only when required. The favourite system for study was the 0-galactosidase of Escherichia coli, an enzyme that could be switched on when necessary to metabolize the milk sugar lactose. The demonstration that adaptive enzyme formation involved synthesis of the protein de novo was regarded as essential-Monod, M. Cohn and D.S. Hogness did this with P-galac- tosidase, and Pollock and A.M. Torriani, pursuing a similar objective with penicillinase, iso- lated and crystallized the enzyme (13). From now on, Pollock was helped by Joan Fleming (see, for example, (27)), whom he described as 'an extremely intelligent woman but with rather limited theoretical knowledge, and was for me practically the perfect assistant in every way'. She stayed with him until his retirement, when the University of Edinburgh awarded her an honorary degree. In some ways the penicillinase system proved disappointing for the study of enzymic induction or adaptation. Although 'constitutive' mutants in which the enzyme was synthesized continuously were produced, and these made biochemical studies of the protein feasible, the bacilli were at that time only just becoming genetically accessible (20). The synthesis of com- pounds related to penicillin that might prove to be inducers, but not substrates, was very dif- ficult, and the multiple forms of the enzyme were hard to understand, but they were useful in investigations of extracellularity in bacterial enzymes and proteins (17, 18). The enzyme was</page><page sequence="7">Martin Rivers Pollock 363 found to be extracellular; however, some enzyme was also attached to the cell, and in some cases could be released by chemical treatment. Much effort was necessary to determine whether these various forms were the products of different genes or different post-synthetic modifications. In different bacilli each of the possibilities was found, including the occurrence of mechanistically (and so evolutionarily) different 'penicillinases'. Another interesting phe- nomenon was the discovery of stimulating as well as inhibitory antibodies for penicillinases (19). Other aspects of the penicillinase system were explored and proved very rewarding to Pollock and his associates. These included studies initiated by Richard Novick and Mark (now Sir Mark) Richmond (F.R.S. 1980) on the nature of the instability of a bacterium's capacity to produce penicillinase, which showed that the gene was carried on a plasmid in Staphylococcus aureus and the enterobacter. This work is reviewed in (31), and, in a more light-hearted mood, in some of Pollock's cartoons reproduced in figure 1. The amino acid sequences of penicilli- nases from several diverse organisms were determined and although most were similar, some totally different penicillinases were recognized (32), and the tertiary structures of penicilli- nases were (at last) determined. The penicillinases were some of the earliest enzymes for which both the amino acid sequence of the functioning protein and the DNA sequence of the gene were determined, and these data identified the leader sequences necessary for protein export. Through the characterization of P-lactamases (as the enzymes are now better called) from many different organisms, it has become clear that an original gene has spread widely through the bacterial world. Because a penicillinase gene enables a bacterium to grow in the presence of penicillin it confers a basis for selection. Subsequently this has had a major role in the development of vectors, such as pBR322, for the cloning and analysis of DNA. Pollock was elected to the Fellowship of The Royal Society in 1962, to his own surprise and that of Monod, about whom Pollock wrote the plaudit for his Nobel Prize for Nature (22), and an obituary (34) and also a very revealing chapter on 'An exciting but exasperating per- sonality' (37) in a tribute volume to Monod. In another chapter in this volume Melvin Cohn includes the cartoon illustrated in figure 2, which was drawn by Pollock in 1953 and on which Cohn comments as follows ((37), p.81): However, why we were so insufferably sure of ourselves is not clear to me. Given what we know today one might say that we had not advanced very far. Justifiably annoyed by our arrogance, Martin Pollock produced a cartoon in 1953 which at the time was upsetting to me but brought pleasure to Monod. Pollock's cartoon shows Monod standing over a starry eyed American (myself) symbolised by an out- landish tie, to whom he is saying 'Bravo my fine fellow! You have made remarkable observations-naturally without having done or understood anything--but nevertheless spectacular. Bravo! Continue the good work.' In the wastepaper basket are the papers of Pollock on penicillinase; on the wall is a depiction of 'Who killed cock robin (Sir Cyril Hinshelwood)?', above that is Max Delbriick smiling approval; next to Max is plotted Monod's temperature as a function of Sol Spiegelman's publications (notice how normal it is after the Benzer experiment); Monod's law AZ/AB is inscribed on the French tricolor behind us; and on the left was Pollock's evaluation of our accomplishments; we had destroyed all existing so-called facts, replacing them with nothing he was willing to believe (faits confirmis); and we had produced nothing but wild theories. This is how Pollock saw us in 1953. [He had a personal piece of advice to me which did not escape my notice, sym- bolised by the mouse in the left corner. Go back to the study of antibody synthesis in mice! In fact long before molecular biology could influence immunology Pollock proposed as the key, the study of the clonal distribu- tion of antibodies (one cell-one antibody).] Today, I understand Monod's reaction of pleasure because such understanding could only have been the consequence of profound friendship.</page><page sequence="8">364 Biographical Memoirs (a) w d30 YO plw4x(b) L "E.Y'LL L fSCoffalt A C VAN N 4R curr .I ,,I ,,:,, l 1PENICII.SIH?

The bacterium at the bench is frantically working with 'Gene', 'Selection', 'Mutation', etc., although his (very sick) colleague says, 'It looks hopeless'. (c) A sick bacterium in delirium has 'plasmid dreams' (1967). Pollock was always concerned with scientific ideas that had been generally discounted but which he thought contained unappreciated truth. Among these were the ideas of Sir Cyril Hinshelwood, F.R.S. (P.R.S. 1955-60), in The chemical kinetics of the bacterial cell (Oxford University Press, 1946) and the phenomena that M. Kramer in Hungary had observed with intermediates in penicillinase synthesis (14). He wrote both definitive (15, 24) and general (for example (31)) reviews of bacterial penicillinases, and was very interested in the question of their origin and the significance of their range and variation (25, 26). A NEW UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT AT EDINBURGH From about 1960, Pollock had 'begun to want to teach for some time after I had really started to run out of ideas'. He realized that biological progress would be made by a combination of the skills of biochemistry, microbiology and genetics, and through his friendship with Bill</page><page sequence="9">Martin Rivers Pollock 365 ~~e~cr FAiTS u Atst Figure 2. Impression of Monod's laboratory at the Institut Pasteur, drawn by Pollock in 1953. Hayes (F.R.S. 1964; then Director of MRC Microbial Genetics Research Unit at Hammersmith Hospital) they together set about looking for a niche in which to establish such a teaching department. This was the heady Robbins time of expansion and new universities, and the short list came down to Brighton or Edinburgh. The development of molecular biology was already apparent in some of the departments at Edinburgh thanks to the activities of Peter Walker (MRC Genome Unit in the Department of Zoology), C.H. Waddington, F.R.S. (through his subdepartment of Epigenetics, with Max Birnstiel, John Bishop and Ken Jones), Ulrich Loening (Department of Botany) and others. Strongly encouraged by both M.M. (later Lord) Swann, F.R.S., and Waddington, Pollock and Hayes submitted a proposal to the MRC in 1963 for the establishment of an Institute of Molecular Biology (administered by the MRC separately from the University) with about 30 scientific staff (an increase of about 50% on their combined groups at the time), who would have honorary teaching titles and some teaching responsibilities, mainly to senior undergrad- uate and postgraduate students, in a suitable adjacent university department. The overall pro- posal was certainly an ambitious one, and although the MRC declined to fund the project as proposed, it did provide extensive and very necessary financial support for a new University Department of Molecular Biology based on Pollock's MRC Research Group on Bacterial Enzyme Variation, which involved five scientific staff, and the transfer of the majority of Hayes's MRC Microbial Genetics Unit from the Hammersmith Hospital. Pollock considered that this to all intents and purposes ended his research career, but dur- ing the next 10 years he wrote and talked extensively about the scope and potentialities of</page><page sequence="10">366 Biographical Memoirs molecular biology (21, 28, 29) and inspired all with whom he came into contact. His Inaugural Lecture ('What is molecular biology?' (23)) provides a vivid example of the thoroughness and rigour behind his restless intellect, and his discussion of the exchange of DNA between organ- isms and the role of viruses and plasmids in transduction, conjugation and transformation in this process was indeed perspicacious. In this lecture he also expressed his belief that the ease with which this occurred in the laboratory meant that, given evolutionary time, exchange (and fixation) between different species was likely and as a result we would find 'networks of diverging and reassociating lines of development' superimposed on 'evolutionary trees'. This prediction has at last been abundantly confirmed now that complete genomic sequences have been determined. And so, after 24 years with the MRC, Pollock moved with his group from Mill Hill-John Collins, Joan Fleming, Sue Hewlett, Peter Thompson and Mark Richmond (who played a prominent role in planning teaching courses and major changes to a new building to accom- modate the expanding department before leaving three years later for a chair in bacteriology at the University of Bristol). This was the vanguard that, reinforced with new university staff appointments to lead initiatives in protein chemistry (R.P.A.) and electron microscopy (Peter Highton), and two members of the former Biophysics Unit (a subdepartment of the Department of Physics), laid the foundation for the development of the new Department of Molecular Biology. The merger with the genetic elements followed when the eventual com- pletion of a new building in 1968 (which the university named in honour of Darwin-Pollock had suggested that calling it the Monboddo Building1o would be more suitable, remembering Darwin's comments about his year of medical studies at Edinburgh) allowed the long- expected movement of Bill Hayes with his MRC Bacterial Genetics Unit from Hammersmith Hospital to be realized. In retrospect this could perhaps be regarded as a forerunner in the aca- demic sphere of the now well-known, indeed sometimes almost rampant, merger and acquisi- tion activity of the business world, and although not initially received with enthusiasm throughout the entire faculties of science and medicine it served as a successful example for more extensive structural changes that developed subsequently. Meanwhile, four additional university staff appointments had been made (including Bill Brammar and K.M.) to broaden the more molecular end of the department's activities and to reinforce the connection between the bacterial physiology and microbial genetic groups so that the department was ready to assume its full role in teaching and research in the academic year beginning in October 1968. Two of the new lectureships were made as short-term career development appointments (three to five years) to provide a continuing opportunity for intro- ducing new research into the department, a policy that proved effective and was extended through a number of cycles over several years. Pollock's political conviction was apparent in the way that he built and ran his department; he did indeed believe that one should practise that which one preached, and was at pains to involve colleagues at all levels in the recruitment of new staff and research students, and in developing departmental policy-but was exasperated if they grumbled without having read the background papers he made available. The integration of the MRC Unit, now renamed the Molecular Genetics Unit, within the university department was handled very sensitively by Pollock and Hayes (who now held a personal chair in the university) to generate a real sense of unity or cohesion of the two components, which were of similar size. The department's teaching activities had begun with postgraduate research students on its formation in 1965; its commitments to undergraduate teaching began in the academic year 1968/69 with two courses</page><page sequence="11">Martin Rivers Pollock 367 to third-year students, one in microbial genetics-organized and given principally by the members of the MRC Unit-and the other in molecular biology, which was largely the respon- sibility of the university staff members. The honours molecular biology degree courses were introduced in the following year, and their design and prosecution was also shared by both uni- versity and MRC staff. Similarly, prospective postgraduate students could choose to work in areas under the auspices and supervision of either MRC or university staff, and there was no formal geographical separation of laboratories between the two components of the depart- ment. On the basis of experience with these courses, Pollock became involved in The Open University's Foundation Course in Molecular Biology (30). Five years elapsed between the formal opening of the Department of Molecular Biology and the graduation of its first honours BSc students, but its recruitment of research students for the PhD degree began within the first year of its existence. Obviously these came from elsewhere and from other subjects because this was the UK's first university department of molecular biology. Selection of these students and their allocation to topics or supervisors were openly competitive and based primarily on the students' interests rather than on any type of quota system. This policy was widely perceived as being in everyone's best interests and was the basis of a subsequent consensus-based decision that the department's own honours graduates would not be eligible for places as PhD students in the department but would be strongly encouraged to continue their education and training elsewhere, preferably at a differ- ent university. It was perhaps an extension of these ideals that led Pollock, with John Scaife and Andrew Coulson, to propose and indeed initiate the so-called Mini UCCA (Universities Central Council on Admissions) Scheme for postgraduate student positions nationally. Pollock was a strong advocate of interdepartmental collaboration at all levels of activity. He was a staunch supporter of the Biology Teaching Unit, introduced in 1966 as an inter-fac- ulty organization under the direction of Ron Kille to coordinate the undergraduate teaching of biological subjects in the Faculties of Science, Forestry and Agricultural Ordinance. He was also the prime mover in the foundation of the School of Biology (and the first Chairman of its Working Party) in 1973 (Birse 1994). This was a loose federation of all departments involved in teaching biological science in the Faculty of Science and Engineering, the Faculty of Medicine and the Department of Psychology (Faculty of Social Sciences); it was to have an increasingly important innovatory role in the design and reorganization of teaching and, sub- sequently, of research activities and physical resources in the years ahead. It was also the pred- ecessor of the Faculty of Science's Division of Biological Sciences (comprising three Institutes: Cell and Molecular Biology; Cell, Animal and Population Biology; and Ecology and Resource Management) resulting from an extensive regrouping and reorganization of the faculty's seven biological departments in 1990, and in which the affiliation of academic staff with a particular Institute was governed mainly by research activities, but teaching commit- ments could be made where most appropriate in the Division. The new department soon became established within the circle of biological science, both locally and nationally, through interdepartmental teaching programmes, participation in inter- national courses and workshops, and numerous collaborative research activities at a more indi- vidual level, the last being catalysed by the rapidly increasing excitement in nucleic acid biochemistry universally, which was itself enjoying the synergy generated through combina- tions with microbial genetics. The appointment of Barrie Marmion (with whom Pollock had worked at Leicester many years earlier) to the Robert Irvine Chair of Medical Microbiology at Edinburgh at about this time (1968), an appointment in which Pollock played a substantive</page><page sequence="12">368 Biographical Memoirs role, proved to be a very significant local development, because in the wake of a serious out- break of serum hepatitis (as hepatitis B was then described) at Edinburgh in 1969 he initiated a research programme on the virus and its serology that provided the basis for valuable col- laborative molecular biology a decade later. Pollock's interdisciplinary interests and activities extended beyond the normal range of bio- logical sciences. His interactions with Donald Michie, Richard Gregory (F.R.S. 1992) and Christopher Longuet Higgins, F.R.S., of the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception, led to his role as a co-founder and first Steering Committee Chairman of the School of Epistemics. This was established in the Faculty of Science in 1969 to bring together those having 'a common concern with the nature of knowledge and understanding and the means whereby knowledge and understanding may be achieved'. He continued to travel widely in pursuit of his various academic and political interests and maintained active links with colleagues throughout the world, including his involvement in nuclear disarmament campaigns and the Pugwash Conferences. He also had an active and enthusiastic interest in the arts, with talks and articles on arts and science (for example (36)) and an involvement in the annual exhibition of paintings by the university staff at the Talbot Rice Centre. One of the well-known local contemporaries in this area was Edith Simon (the wife of Eric Reeve in the Department of Genetics), whose drawing, entitled 'Microcosm', of members of the Department of Molecular Biology under the watchful eye of the head of their department (in 1974) is reproduced in figure 3 with her kind permission. Another reminder of his interest in art is the large mural by another local artist, George Garson, which filled one wall of the foyer on the entrance level of the department in the Darwin Building. The introduction of recombinant DNA opportunities and methods, in which the department had a leading role, was about to revolutionize research in biology more generally and open a range of new opportunities in both basic research into fundamental biological processes and applications in the pharmaceutical and other biology-based industries. These were readily appreciated by Dr Tom (now Sir Tom) McKillop and Dr Ed Dart in the ICI Corporate Laboratory at Runcorn (but less obviously so in other industrial and government sectors in the UK at the time), and their proposal to establish one of the company's new Joint Research Schemes as a collaborative genetic engineering project with the Department (involving Bill Brammar, Noreen Murray (F.R.S. 1982)-a member of the MRC Unit-and K.M. and their groups) was very positively welcomed by Pollock and was significantly beneficial to the development of gene cloning methods in the department. Biological sciences generally had reached a particularly exciting and stimulating phase at Edinburgh by the early 1970s, but for the Department of Molecular Biology storm clouds were approaching. First came the 'Winter of Discontent' arising from the second and protracted confrontation between Heath's government and the trade unions, which caused a frustrating series of strikes and random power cuts, which in turn led to many significant delays in criti- cal experiments-it was not amusing to find the ultracentrifuges stopped midway through key purification steps of preparations of bacteriophage or DNA fragments. But far more serious was the decision by Hayes to leave Edinburgh for an appointment at Canberra in 1973. The MRC, perhaps persuaded that microbial genetics was indeed now a mature subject, if not yet quite a closed book, decided to follow its practice of closing its research units on the retirement or departure of their director, in spite of a strongly supportive report in this instance after a review and a site visit the previous year. This was indeed a cri- sis for the department, which Pollock managed very successfully. Through discussions with</page><page sequence="13">Martin Rivers Pollock 369 4[ Figure 3. 'Microcosm', a drawing by Edith Simon of members of the Department of Molecular Biology after the closure of the MRC Unit of Molecular Genetics in 1973. the Dean (Norman Feather, F.R.S.) and Pollock, the MRC reaffirmed its support for molecu- lar genetics and its intention to assist the university in maintaining a strong centre of molecu- lar biology. This was eventually accomplished by enlarging the university's Department of Molecular Biology through incorporating into it all the tenured scientists from the MRC unit who so wished at the time of disbanding (six), together with supporting technical and secre- tarial staff, as a Molecular Genetics Group. In addition to reimbursement of the university for the costs associated with these appointments, the scientific staff involved were also free to apply for additional research grants from the MRC or other sources in the usual way. These splendid salvage arrangements came into effect in 1974 and continued for many years until the number of the remaining scientific staff declined to three, whereupon their positions became the financial responsibility of the university. Meanwhile, Pollock continued to be an enthusiastic apostle of his subject, pursuing further, broader interactions nationally, internationally and professionally. On the immediate scientific front he engaged positively in the wide-ranging debate on genetic engineering, emphasizing the likely benefits from its applications (development of new vaccines, for example) while rec- ognizing the need for caution over much-publicized potential biohazards (hypothetical would</page><page sequence="14">370 Biographical Memoirs have been a better word); he insisted that the latter could be evaluated through experiment and contained by appropriate existing physical containment facilities if necessary, and recognized potential application in the area of biological weapons and warfare as a problem worthy of more serious analysis. His wider contributions in this area were made through discussions on BBC radio broadcasts (in a discussion on the Moratorium on Genetic Engineering in the John Maddox 'Scientifically speaking' series, September 1974, and a more broadly based pro- gramme 'Where are you taking us?' with Jeff Watts and Michael Bright, January 1975), a con- cise, focused letter in Trends in Biochemical Sciences (35), and through several lectures. Locally, his support and advice enabled his department to establish suitable physical contain- ment facilities at a very early stage so that delays to some leading research projects were mini- mal. His more important invited lectures include the third Griffith Memorial Lecture in 1970 (28), the Huxley and Bernal Lectures (33) in 1975, and several more politically orientated con- tributions at international meetings, several of which are included in the full bibliography. RECREATION AND RETIREMENT Pollock enjoyed adventurous travel in warm climates. In 1961 he and his wife and their four children (then in their late teens) travelled the length of South America, from Uruguay to Mexico, in a motorized caravan, and then shipped the vehicle to Cuba and presented it to Fidel Castro for use as a mobile library. In 1972 he made a six-month African trip with some friends, and his son Jonathan, across the Sahara into the Middle East and then back to Europe through Turkey. He was also an enthusiastic yachtsman, presenting one boat to the NIMR when he left to move to Edinburgh, and getting another one for the north. Pollock retired in 1976, frustrated by the desertion of Hayes for sunnier climes (and no administration) in Australia, the policy of negative feedback applied to his successful depart- ment by the university, and by the Scottish climate. A valedictory letter of 10 August to his department expressed his feelings about the physical climate very clearly, and he would undoubtedly have agreed with Robert Louis Stevenson's introductory comments to Picturesque notes on Edinburgh made almost 100 years earlier (Stevenson 1879): But Edinburgh pays cruelly for her high seat in one of the vilest climates under heaven. She is liable to be beaten upon by all the winds that blow, to be drenched with rain, to be buried in cold sea fogs out of the east, and powdered with the snow as it comes flying southward from the Highland hills. The weather is raw and boisterous in winter, shifty and ungenial in summer, and a downright meteorological purgatory in the spring. The delicate die early, and I, as a survivor, among bleak winds and plumping rain, have been sometimes tempted to envy them their fate. He continued to keep in touch with penicillinase, attending his last scientific meeting on the subject at the Escorial in 1982. He was now spending more time on his own painting (he had left a mural above his office door on departure), and organized a meeting on 'Common denominators in art and science' (38) as his last academic contribution to Edinburgh. He and Jean had divorced in 1974, and he married Janet Machen in 1979. He hoped to spend the rest of his life painting-he moved to a seventeenth-century farmhouse in Dorset-and writing books for children, but had a minor stroke in 1985 that badly affected his confidence and belief in his own continuing creativity. Pollock's last visit to his old department was in July 1996, when the Duke of Edinburgh opened the Swann Building linked to his own old Darwin Building. This at last gave his sub-</page><page sequence="15">Martin Rivers Pollock 371 ject adequate space and facilities-The Wellcome Trust, which provided substantial financial help (together with The Darwin Trust, The Wolfson Foundation and a contribution from the University) described it as a 'Business Class' laboratory, certainly an apt comparison with the Darwin Building which although planned in the halcyon days of the early 1960s was con- structed under conditions of progressively and rapidly increasing austerity later in that decade. One wondered what he thought as he viewed the changes in his old department and the pro- found impact (which he had predicted) of the subject over the previous 30 years. Of one thing we can be quite sure: Martin would never have been satisfied with the department that he, with Hayes and Swann, had created-nor should his associates and successors be--but one hopes that he derived some pleasure from his scientific legacy. Those of us fortunate enough to work with him and benefit from his warm friendship, his restless personality, his probing intellect and even (perhaps especially) his impatience will always be grateful for his leadership and the example he gave of the imperatives of both intellectual and personal integrity, of the need to challenge and debate ideas, of a balance between democracy and authority, of the importance of commitment, of open-mindedness, of maintaining a sense of proportion, of personal and professional values and, perhaps above all, of fairness to others, whatever the circumstances. He died on 21 December 1999 in Shaftesbury, in the heart of the Wessex he loved. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are most grateful to Martin's younger son, Dr Jonathan Pollock, for making available to us the biographical mem- oir written by his father in 1984 (the source of several of our quotations), to him and Martin's widow, Janet, for reviewing this manuscript, and to Janet and to Edith Simon for their kind permission to reproduce the drawings. We also thank the other members of Martin's family, and our colleagues, Professor Barrie Marmion, Professor Peter Sneath, F.R.S., Professor Paul Broda, Professor John Phillips, Professor Aubrey Manning, Dr Des Truman and all oth- ers who participated in the Happening in the Swann Auditorium at King's Buildings on 8 September 2000 in appre- ciation of Martin's role in the development of research and teaching in Molecular Biology at Edinburgh.
