<plain_text><page sequence="1">Action. By D. G. BROWN. (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin. 1968. Pp. xii + 150. Price 45s.) This is a nicely written, elegantly produced, and sometimes exciting addition to the analysis of human action. Brown calls his work a "theory ", but it is not so much that as an interesting picture of our ways of thinking about human deeds : it does not generate new questions and problems and provides no way of resolving disputed cases; the presentation is lucid and loose, full of such ideas as direct vs. indirect explanation, "nuclear ", " parasitical ", " attenuated ", " degenerate " cases and " stretched senses ", explained only by cases currently being distinguished or relegated; Brown becomes disappointingly vague just where an answer is promised having to do with the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 289 provision of psychological explanation, in terms of " reasons, intentions, purposes, and the like " (p. 135). The book consists of short sections grouped into four chapters entitled " The Point of View of the Agent ", " The Agent and His Body ", " The Origin of the Idea of Agency ", and " The Attribution of Effects ". In the first chapter, Brown claims to isolate a category of things which it makes sense to consider doing. His main thesis here is that, " the question of what to do is not the question of what some particular person is to do (which might be anyone's question) but some particular person's ques- tion of: what to do " (p. 24). In Chapter 2, Brown proposes what turns out to be more than an analogy between animate and inanimate action. He then observes a lack of parallelism in the consideration that some cases of animate action may occur which do not require a " mode of operation " by which an affect is produced. In Chapter 3 Brown argues that the idea of agency seen from the agent's point of view seems " brute " and irreducible, and is so represented in the "empiricist " theory (against which he protests) as an introspected, simple idea of reflexion. As a preliminary to this, Brown supplies a welcome and valuable criticism of the widely held and seemingly plausible view that our idea of inanimate action is the result of the anthropomorphic projection of the introspected idea of agency. To set things right, we must come to see action from the position of a spectator and that is the theme of Chapter 4. I think that what Brown is proposing here is that the spectator can see animate action as something that could be explained from the agent's point of view by reference to reasons bearing on deliberation. The action is viewed as one of settling a question of what to do, or as the carrying out of a decision that settled the question, or as action upon the realiza- tion that a consideration settled the question. I liked the beginning of the book better than the end. The starkly economical picture of human action adumbrated in Chapter 2 makes a strong initial impression which is lost in Chapter 4, which seemed to me to be little more than a darkening of the lines. The book was obviously a long time in preparation and, despite its considerable merits, was dated and substantially refuted before it was finished. Brown's style of thought is a subtle continuation of the tendencies of the '50s' : the book is shot through with the now suspect division between empirical and conceptual questions, and it trades heavily on the now discredited distinction between reasons and causes. Brown is consequentially insensitive to the recently much noted " opacity " of the concepts with which he deals. His idea that facts seen from the agent's point of view are different from facts seen from the spectator's point of view is one unfortunate result, and his distinction between persons and their bodies is another. Most seriously of all, Brown's account of explanatory attributability is ruined by his neglect of opacity. To say " The room was lighted because the switch was thrown " is not to say " The switch was thrown because the room was lighted ", even though illuminating the room and throw- ing the switch may be one and the same event or fact. This shows that explanatory attributability is not a relation, as Brown seems to want to maintain. Looking more at specific points: Brown explains the agent's point of view, ex- pounded in Chapter 1, first by reference to a breakdown in parallelism between animate and inanimate action as viewed by a spectator, then in terms of non-causal psycho- logical explanation and, finally, as being due to the relative complexity of the pheno- mena. Although his main concern is with deliberative human action, he rightly stresses the " primacy " of inanimate action. He claims to find a differentia in the fact that there are primitive if rare sorts of animate action, of which blowing and head-nodding are prime examples, which, unlike inanimate action, have no assignable "mode of operation ", thereby showing that " the availability of a mode of operation is not a necessary condition of the attributability of motion to a person " (p. 133). But that surely must be a mistake. We can speak of the boiling action of the water-which is inanimate-although there is no immediately assignable mode of operation. Brown prefers non-causal psychological explanation, given in terms of the exercise of capacities, " intentions, reasons and the like ", over the notorious acts of will, to fill in for the alleged missing mode of operation. I am not sure what the difference comes down to in the end. Anyway, Brown needs a more firmly based distinction be- tween causal and non-causal factors than he has provided. His concluding speculation, that we can account for the existence of non-causal explanation and for its relevance to causal explanation as a device of ignorance forced upon us by complexity of organic phenomena, is as desperate as it is unconvincing. The causally exponible physics of perception (for example) is no less intricate than the physiology, if indeed they differ at all. Brown must finally simply rely on the alleged fact of the agent's point of view, with which he began and which he does not succeed in explaining. In the course of reading the book, I became convinced that the agent's point of view is an illusion. The relegation of non-deliberative, non-human deeds, which stress</page><page sequence="3">290 BOOK REVIEWS on the agent's point of view requires, is, to say the least, suspect. I would prefer them for my " nuclear " cases for, first, self-consciousness is not the commonest thing even in the human world and, second, I don't discern any ambiguity between saying that the dog is eating or seeking attention and saying that the guest is. In concentrating so much on deliberation (instead of on the observed effects of belief), Brown is unable to find his way into the position of a spectator, and therefore does not achieve the re- sults he desires. Perhaps there is a way out of the fully self-conscious case, for eating is the sort of thing which it makes sense to consider doing. Brown refuses that helping hand. Any action full-blown is, as he sees it, the result of deliberation whose occurrence effectively defines a point of view: " One can discuss a question of what to do, notice how it arose, or give advice about settling it, when it is someone else's question. But if one is actually to consider such a question itself, it must be one's own question, and must concern what one is to do oneself" (p. 8). But can I not wonder what Napoleon or Natasha should have done ? Brown argues for the distinctiveness of the agent's point of view on the grounds that it precludes a certain kind of complexity. He says, for example, that "I cannot wonder whether to betray a secret unintentionally, or absent-mindedly, or accidentally " (p. 24). But if I were to consider the question of what you should do, I wouldn't consider whether you should do it "accidentally ". Only actual done deeds, as against contemplated actions, are done accidentally. The difference is not over who can ask a question, or of comparative logical simplicity, but over what we are talking about. Brown's line, with its stress on deliberation, reason, and answers to a question "why ? ", is Anscombian, as he points out. But how far does he want to go ? He says the outcome of deliberation (the action ?) is "action in accordance with reason ". That may mean that action is something done for a reason. But he seems to hold the stronger but implausible view that our separate deliberations cannot issue in the same (sort of ?) outcome if we act for different reasons. So, is "the category of things " which it makes sense to consider doing a category of deeds done, behavioural sorts, or actions contemplated ? And could the same action have been done for different reasons ? I can't tell. The opacity, created by defining the alleged " category " in terms of a considered question, makes it thoroughly dubious. In a footnote, Brown confesses sliding " past difficult questions about the individuation of things which one can con- sider doing and the individuation of actions and the relation between the two " (p. 28), as if he could discharge an obligation with a disclaimer. Finally, I should observe that Brown's stress on points of view with its suggestion of a double criterion for action, naturally leads him to a Strawsonian conception of a person, as something dependent upon but " categorically distinct" from his body (see, e.g., p. 44). I think this must also be reckoned a mistake. Brown's appeal to a difference in sense between "having a body" and " being a body" does not carry the day unless the tree, whose body turns into stone when it is petrified, is something categorically distinct from its body, perhaps enjoying its own special point of view.
