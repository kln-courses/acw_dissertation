<plain_text><page sequence="1">Avicenna's Philosophical Approach to the Qur'an in the Light of His Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas Daniel De Smet &amp; Meryem Sebti CNRS, Paris As one of the most outstanding philosophers (falasifa) in the Muslim world, Avicenna (Ibn Slna, d. 428/1037) showed a great interest in the Qur'an and in Islamic religion in general.1 Although in most of his works he quotes ay as from the Qur'an, the way he uses and interprets them has not been studied thoroughly until now.2 Modern research mainly considers Avicenna as an Arabic Aristotelian, whose thought reflects an Alexandrian, Neo-Platonic reading of Aristotle. True as this may be, the Islamic elements in Avicenna's writings are all too often bypassed as mere superficial and secondary concessions to his religious and cultural environment. In order to clarify Avicenna's approach to the Qur'an and to establish the nature of his philosophical reading of the Qur'anic text, we are currently preparing an annotated French translation of his six small treatises on Tafsir.3 As a preliminary result of our research, the present article raises the question of the relationship between Avicenna's metaphysics and the Qur'an, based on his Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas (Q. 112). Avicenna's Risala al-adhawiyya ft amr al-macad contains a passage about the aims of tafsir al-QurDdn, which serves as a perfect introduction to his philosophical reading of Surat al-Ikhlas. He claims that the task of the philosopher when interpreting the Qur'an is to assert tawhid: the absolute unity and uniqueness of God. The numerous ayas describing God in anthropomorphic terms are to be taken in a metaphorical sense: they are only images meant for the common people, who would be confused and led astray by a theoretical exposition of tawhid, as their minds are unable to understand it. Avicenna then gives the following definition of tawhid:4 To acknowledge that the Creator is one, that He is sanctified above the how many and the how, the where and when, position and change, so Journal of Qur'anic Studies 11.2 (2009): 134-148 Edinburgh University Press DOI: 10.3366/E1465359110000847 ?

[However,] it is forbidden to expose this to the common people. Next, Avicenna argues that the Torah and the Qur'an, when speaking about the essence of God, had to use anthropomorphic expressions, since they are the only ones accessible to the common people. The aim of any philosophical reading of the Qur'an is therefore to restore pure tawhld by interpreting, allegorically, the figurative language of the Prophet.5 Applying this general principle as exposed in his Adhawiyya, Avicenna devoted a tafslr to Surat al-Ikhlds, which comprises one of the longest of his Qur'anic commentaries.6 This treatise is particularly important for our present purpose as Avicenna uses here his main metaphysical concepts - such as huwiyya, wdjib al-wujud, mumkin al-wujud, lawazim, muqawwimdt - in order to interpret the revealed text.7 However, if the tools used by Avicenna are philosophical, his aim is theological: it is to establish the radicality of tawhld by a philosophical analysis of every word of the sura. Although this sura - also known as Surat al-Tawhld and al-Samadiyya - is generally considered as the purest expression of God's unity and uniqueness in the Qur'an, the text still needs, according to Avicenna, a philosophical exegesis in order to prove that what is said about God in the four ayas of the sura is in no way contradicting His absolute simplicity. The author's main point is that in the first two ayas, only huwa refers to the Necessary Existent in Himself, whereas all the remaining words (Allah, ahad, al-samad) are necessary concomitants (lawazim) caused by the Necessary Existent. As we shall see, this radical interpretation, which is at variance with all previous commentaries on Surat al-Ikhlds,s although being in line with Avicenna's general conception of the divine attributes,9 raises some startling questions. Without entering into all details of the complex argumentation developed in this very condensed text, Avicenna's interpretation of Q. 112 can be summarised as follows. Qul huwa Alldhu ahad (Q. 112:1) Avicenna takes the word huwa as referring to the 'absolute He' (al-huwa al-mutlaq), whose 'ipseity' (huwiyya) is not dependent on another being, as 'He is He by His own essence' (huwa huwa li-dhdtihi). This is the Necessary Existent (wdjib al-wujud) whose quiddity (mdhiyya) is identical with His existence (wujud): His essence is that He exists. The absolute huwiyya cannot be expressed by any name (ism); it can only be explained (shark) by the concomitants (lawazim) that necessarily follow from His</page><page sequence="3">136 Journal of Qur'anic Studies being,10 and not by His constituents (muqawwimat), since He has no constituents at all, His essence being absolutely one.11 As the ipseity of the Necessary Existent is in itself unknowable, it can only be approached by its concomitants:12 The ipseity of the first principle (al-mabda3 al-awwal) has a great number of concomitants, but these concomitants are disposed in a certain order (mutarattaba); moreover, the concomitants are caused (maclulat). From that which is the One, the True, the Simple, in all aspects, only one thing can proceed (yasdur), be it in a descending order, from Him onwards, vertically and horizontally (cala'l-tartib al-nazil min Hndahu tulan wa-cardan), so that the close concomitant (al-lazim al-qarlb) is more able to make known (ashaddu tacrifan)13 (the first principle) than the distant concomitant (al-lazim al-bacid). This passage obviously describes the emanation of the chain of beings, starting with the cosmic Intelligences, one by one (as from the one only one can proceed, according to a well known Neo-Platonic principle), in a descending hierarchical order. Although it is not clear what Avicenna means by 'tulan wa-cardan\u the doctrine contained in this passage is truly Avicennian. According to the Neo-Platonic inspiration of Avicenna's cosmology, based on emanation, all 'creatures'15 necessarily proceed from the perfection of the Necessary Existent: so they are His lawazim or necessary concomitants. Being unknowable in His ipseity, the Necessary Existent can only be known through His 'creation', i.e. through the hierarchy of beings that proceed from Him. The higher a being is situated in 'the great chain of being' (to use Arthur Lovejoy's famous expression),16 the more it is able to 'make known' the Necessary Existent.17 Besides close and distant concomitants, Avicenna furthermore distinguishes in his Tafsir relative and negative concomitants:18 Among the concomitants, some express a relation (idaftyya) and others a negation (salbiyya). The relative concomitants are more able to make known (ashadd tacrlfan) than the negative. But what makes known in the most perfect way is the concomitant that is both relative and negative. This distinction between 'relative', 'negative' and a 'combination of both' is generally used by Avicenna in his classification of the divine attributes: besides negative attributes which express God's otherness from creation and relative or positive ones which express His relation to creation, there are attributes combining both negative and positive aspects.19</page><page sequence="4">Avicenna's Philosophical Approach to the Qur'an 137 Indeed, turning in his Tafsir to the next word of the Qur'anic ay a, Allah, Avicenna states immediately after the passage translated above:20 This is why this ipseity is called Allah, as the deity (al-ilah) is the one with whom all the other beings are in relation, whereas he is not related at all to them. The absolute deity (al-ilah al-mutlaq) is the one who is disposed in such a way to all beings: the fact that others are related to him expresses a relation (idafi), the fact that He is not related to something else, expresses a negation ... So we have shown that the name Allah encompasses both [i.e. relation and negation], without any possible doubt. The aya thus continues by mentioning Allah, as what reveals the meaning of the word huwa and explains it. Therefore, 'the divinity' (al-ilahiyya) is the first concomitant of the Necessary Existent, as it expresses at the same time a negative and a positive relation: it is a negative concomitant in so far as it denies that the quiddity of the Necessary Existent is distinct from his existence; it is also a positive concomitant, as it implies that the Necessary Existent is the first principle (al-mabda3 al-awwal)'?1 The first principle has no closer concomitant than the necessity of existence (la yalzamuhu lazim aqdam min wujiib al-wujiid). Hence it is the Necessary Existent. By means of His existence, it belongs to Him that He is the principle of all that He is not (bi-wasitat wujudihi yalzamuhu annahu mabda3 al-kull ma cadahu). The addition of these two things is the divinity (wa-majmuc hadhayn al-amrayn huwa al-ilahiyya). In other words: the unknowable essence of the Necessary Existent manifests itself by its closest concomitant - 'the divinity' - expressed by the name Allah. Such is the meaning of the first two words of the sura:22 As He indicates by His word huwa that the pure and simple ipseity is a reality that cannot be expressed otherwise than [by saying] that He is He, and given the fact that the only way to make it [i.e. this ipseity] known, is by one of its concomitants, He mentions immediately after this the concomitant which is the closest to it: the divinity, that combines two concomitants, a negative and a positive one. From the preceding passages it appears that Avicenna applies in his Tafsir the term 'concomitant' (lazim) both to the beings proceeding from the Necessary Existent and to His attributes, or at least to the name Allah and the property of 'divinity', which are explicitly designated as concomitants of the absolute huwiyya. Next, the aya states, according to Avicenna's interpretation, that the Necessary Existent's inaccessible essence, manifested through its concomitant Allah, is 'one'</page><page sequence="5">138 Journal of Qur'anic Studies (ahad). This means that His essence is absolutely one in itself, having no constituents, while its multiple concomitants are all caused. As 'He is He by His own essence', there is no kind of division in Him. He can only be said 'one' in an analogical way (bi'l-tashklk),23 as His unity, distinct from the numerical one, transcends the different forms of unity which are peculiar to the beings caused by Him.24 After this lengthy philosophical analysis of the first aya of the sura, which takes up two thirds of the whole Tafsir25 Avicenna is now able to explain the remaining three ay as. AMhuyUamad (Q. 112:2) Relying on the current interpretation given to the problematic word al-samad by the mufassirun, who understand it in two quite different ways, as meaning either 'what has no hollowness' (la jawf lahu) or 'the master' (al-sayyid)26 Avicenna takes the term in both senses. As a concomitant of the same kind as al-ilahiyya, its first sense is negative - the Necessary Existent has no quiddity which is distinct from His essence - and its second sense is positive: the affirmation that He is the principle of all beings (mabda3 al-kull). In this way, the word al-samad confirms the meaning of the name Allah, which expresses the same negation and affirmation.27 The first two ayas thus refer to the unknowable huwiyya of the Necessary Existent, which is revealed by its closest concomitants: Allah and al-samad. Lam yalid wa-lam yulad (Q. 112:3) This aya, according to Avicenna, states that the Necessary Existent is the principle of all beings, but without affecting His absolute unity. All things proceed from His liberality (jud) by emanation (fayd), but it is impossible that something similar to Him proceeds from Him, as nothing can participate in His quiddity nor can share the same quiddity with Him. The quiddity of the Necessary Existent is identical with His existence, whereas the possible existents proceeding from Him have a quiddity distinct from their existence. Hence, He has no 'children', as 'He has not begotten' (lam yalid). 'He was not begotten' (lam yulad), as 'He is He by His own essence', and does not depend on anything else.28 Wa-lam yakun lahu kufu?an ahad (Q. 112:4) The last aya of the sura contains the logical conclusion of what precedes. The Necessary Existent has no equal: nothing shares the same quiddity with Him; nothing is equal to Him in the necessity of existence. He is the only Necessary Existent by Himself; hence He is absolutely one and unique.29</page><page sequence="6">Avicenna's Philosophical Approach to the Qur'an 139 After summarising his interpretation of Surat al-Ikhlas, Avicenna concludes his Tafsir with the following statement:31 As the ultimate aim of those who pursue the sciences in their totality is the knowledge of God's essence and attributes (sifat) and the way His actions proceed from Him, and as this sura refers to the path which reveals and points to all that concerns the study of God's essence, it is certainly equivalent to a third of the Qur'an. This is exactly the goal of any philosophical reading of the Qur'an, according to Avicenna, as he clearly expressed it in his Risdla al-adhawiyya. *** However impressive Avicenna's reading of Surat al-Ikhlas may be, his interpretation of the first two ayas raises a doctrinal problem. Throughout his Tafsir, he repeats time and again that Allah and 'the divinity' (al-ilahiyya), along with al-samad, are close concomitants of the Necessary Existent, that are 'making known' His ipseity which is unknowable in itself, in the same way as His ipseity is 'made known' by the hierarchy of beings emanating from it by necessity. In other words, the Tafsir presents as concomitants, caused (maclul) by the Necessary Existent, both the multiplicity of emanated beings or 'creatures' (which is common Avicennian doctrine) and of divine attributes such as al-samad, even going as far as to qualify the name Allah and 'the divinity' as caused concomitants of the Necessary Existent. Or, to put it in still other terms: Avicenna seems to introduce an ontological distinction between, on the one hand, huwa - which refers to the uncaused ipseity of the Necessary Existent - and, on the other, Allah and al-samad, the closest concomitants of the Necessary Existent which, as concomitants, are caused by Him. This observation initially led us to have some doubts about the attribution of the text to Avicenna. But after closer study, these doubts have almost entirely disappeared, although a main difficulty subsists. The manuscript tradition is unanimous in ascribing the Tafsir to Avicenna. According to one of its editors, al-Khatib, and also to Mahdavi, there are no less than 39 manuscripts,32 the oldest dated one being MS Chester Beatty 3045, copied in 699/1299.33 There exist several commentaries on the Tafsir (for instance by Jalal al-Din Muhammad b. Ascad al-Sadiqi, d. 918/1512); furthermore, the treatise was translated into Persian, Turkish and Urdu.34 All manuscripts, translations, commentaries and editions present it under the name of Avicenna. Even stronger than this external evidence is the internal evidence we obtained by a close study of the contents of the treatise: the terminology is undoubtedly Avicennian; moreover, we were able to trace for almost every passage of the Tafsir, parallel</page><page sequence="7">140 Journal of Qur'anic Studies passages in the main works of Avicenna, such as the 'Logic' and the 'Metaphysics' of the Shifa\ the 'Logic of the Orientals', the Ishdrdt and the Tacllqdt. Of all this, we can only briefly present here some samples. The main arguments of Avicenna's reading of Surat al-Ikhlds are summarised at the beginning of the fourth chapter of Book 8 of the 'Metaphysics' of the Shifd3, but without any reference to the Qur'an. Avicenna states here that the Necessary Existent is one, that nothing is sharing with Him an equal rank and thus that nothing other than He is a necessary existence:35 He is the principle (mabda3) of the necessitation of the existence of everything, necessitating (each thing) either in a primary manner or through an intermediary. If the existence of everything other than Him derives from His existence, He is (the) first'; 'The Necessary Existent does not become multiple in any respect whatsoever and His essence is utterly unitary, pure truth'; 'What we mean by our statement that He is one in essence and does not become multiple is that He is as such in His essence. If, thereafter, many positive and negative relations (iddfdt Ijdbiyya wa-salbiyya) become attendant on Him, these are necessary concomitants of the essence that are caused by the essence (lawdzim li'l-dhdt maclula li'l-dhdt); they exist after the existence of the essence, are not constituent of the essence (laysa muqawwim li'l-dhdt), and are not parts of it.' In this passage of the 'Metaphysics', Avicenna uses his doctrine of the concomitants in order to establish the absolute unity and uniqueness of the divine essence, just as he does in the Tafslr. Although the notion of concomitants is central to Avicenna's logic,36 as it is to his metaphysics, it is mainly in his TaHlqdt that he applies it to tawhid, in a way which closely resembles the Tafslr. Thus, he writes in the Tacllqdt:37 The nature (kunh) and the essence (haqlqa) of the First cannot be grasped by human minds. He has an essence (haqlqa) for which we have no name. The necessity of existence is either the explanation (shark) of the name of this essence or one of its concomitants. In fact, it is the most particular (akhass) and the first of its concomitants, as it belongs to it without the intermediary of another concomitant. As to all the other concomitants, some of them exist through the intermediary of the others. In the same way, oneness (al-wahda) is the most particular of the concomitants [of this essence], as it is the real oneness that belongs to it, whereas all the other [kinds of oneness], have necessarily a quiddity [distinct from] existence. But [real oneness] belongs to the most particular of its attributes (sifdt), as nothing shares with it in existence and trueness, existence and trueness being interrelated.</page><page sequence="8">Avicenna's Philosophical Approach to the Qur'an 141 This is indeed very close to what Avicenna says in his Tafslr: the absolute huwiyya of the Necessary Existent cannot be expressed by a name (ism); it can only be explained (shark) by its concomitants (lawazim); 'there does not belong to Him a closer concomitant than the necessity of existence' (Ha yalzamuhu lazim aqdam min wujub al-wujud')?* In another passage of the Tacllqdt, Avicenna states that:39 The concomitants of the First proceed from Him, as they are not present in Him. For this reason, they do not introduce any multiplicity in Him, as He is their principle (mabda3) ... The concomitants of the First, in so far as He is their principle, proceed from Him; they are not linked to Him from something else, nor are they present in Him. His attributes (sifat) are concomitant to His essence (lazima li-dhatihi), in so far as they proceed from Him, not in so far as they are present in Him. For this reason, He is not multiplied by them, as He is the one who makes them necessary. These concomitants and these attributes are concomitant to His essence as He is He, what means that He is their cause (sabab), and not something else ... The concomitant of the First can only be one and simple, as from the one only one can proceed. The next concomitant is the concomitant of His [first] concomitant; the third concomitant is the concomitant of [the second] concomitant, and so on. The multiplicity of the concomitants of the First appears in this way. This again is very close to the argument developed in the Tafslr,40 Explaining further in the Tacllqdt that there is no plurality in the Necessary Existent by Himself, Avicenna states that there cannot be a diversity of attributes in His essence: if this were the case, the attributes would be constitutive parts of His essence, so that His essence would be dependent on these parts and would no longer be one. In consequence, all the attributes are concomitants of his essence:41 The oneness in the First proceeds from Him (canhu) and is in Him (fi-hi) as it is one of His concomitants. As we have seen, Avicenna establishes in his Tafslr Surat al-Ikhlds, with philosophical arguments taken from his metaphysics, God's absolute unity and uniqueness, which is not hampered by the multiple concomitants proceeding from Him. At the same time, he states that God's essence, unknowable in itself, is revealed to the human mind by its concomitants. This notion of 'concomitant' is central to the treatise, whereas the term sifat ('attributes') only occurs once, at the very end of the Tafslr.42 Nevertheless, if we read the text carefully, it is clear that Avicenna means here by 'concomitants' both God's attributes and the beings proceeding from Him.</page><page sequence="9">142 Journal of Qur'anic Studies The parallel passages from the Tacliqat confirm this: all the attributes are concomitants, but not all the concomitants are attributes. Although this selection of passages taken from the 'Metaphysics' of the Shifa0 and the Tacliqat, which could be easily multiplied,43 sufficiently proves that the doctrine exposed in the Tafsir is genuinely Avicennian, there still remains a major problem: the author states explicitly that Allah and 'the divinity' (al-ildhiyya) are concomitants of the Necessary Existent proceeding from Him and thus caused by Him. The unknowable huwiyya of the Necessary Existent reveals itself by the name Allah and 'the divinity;' the latter, as a concomitant expressing at the same time negative and positive relations, seems to encompass all the divine attributes. By establishing an ontological distinction between huwa and Allah, Avicenna's Tafsir seems at variance with the previous interpretations of the aya, which all place the two terms somehow on the same level, huwa being considered as a pronoun introducing Allah.44 Avicenna's exegesis on the contrary, aims at establishing a radical tawhid, devoid of any form of tashbih: even the name Allah and 'the divinity' cannot be applied to the huwiyya of the Necessary Existent. We know of no other texts by Avicenna in which Allah or 'the divinity' are qualified as concomitants or attributes of the Necessary Existent45 Jules Janssens has rightly noticed the absence, in the Tafsir, of any reference to creation: the concomitants proceed from the Necessary Existent by emanation (fayd, sudur). Rather than being an indication in favour of the fact that the Tafsir was written at a very early stage in Avicenna's life, as Janssens assumed,46 we would suggest that the absence of creation could be explained in the light of Avicenna's interpretation of the sura. If he had claimed that all concomitants and attributes, including Allah and 'divinity', are 'created', Avicenna would have been very close to contemporary Ismacill theology. According to Ismacili authors, such as Abu Yacqub al-Sijistam (d. after 361/971) and Hamid al-Dln al-Kirmam (d. after 411/1020), the name Allah and all the divine attributes do not refer to the Creator (mubdic), but to the first created being (al-mubdac al-awwal), the Intellect.47 Of course, this is not Avicenna's opinion! Nevertheless, his Tafsir implies that God, as He reveals Himself in the Qur'an, is 'caused' by an emanation proceeding from the Necessary Existent. This seems at first sight a daring statement and it is perhaps for this reason that Avicenna avoided using the term 'attributes' in his Tafsir.48 However, it is more likely that this assertion should not be understood too radically, as becomes clear from the post-Avicennian tradition. Some mufassirun, posterior to Avicenna and manifestly under his influence, introduce a 'gradation' within the three words which form the first aya of Surat al-Ikhlas. This is the case in Fakhr al-Din al-Razi's Tafsir, according to which the three terms refer to three different 'stations' (maqamat) among 'those who seek (the divine knowledge)' (al-talibun). Hamza and Rizvi summarise al-Razi's text as follows: 'huwa signifies the</page><page sequence="10">Avicenna's Philosophical Approach to the Qur'an 143 undifferentiated one essence that alone requires existence through itself and through whom all other essences are brought into existence, at the level of huwa there is no existence except God. The next term is that of differentiation: God exists - the Lord over His creation which also exists. The third level is that of re-uniting multiplicity to the One.'49 In a similar way, the Sufi cAbd al-Razzaq al-Kashani (d. 736/1336), a disciple of Ibn al-c Arabi, 'uses the terms huwa and Allah to denote different aspects of the divine being. Thus huwa is "an expression for the pure unitive reality, for the essence qua essence without consideration of the attributes," while Allah signifies "the essence with the totality of the attributes".'50 The same distinction is made by Mulla Sadra (d. 1050/1640):51 Huwa Allah is one single reality and one essence. What is expressed by the two [terms] is on the one hand the necessary existence (al-wujud al-wajibi) and the unique essence (al-dhat al-ahadiyya), on the other hand what encompasses the totality of the attributes of perfection and the most beautiful names. The object of the two approaches we mentioned is a unique simple reality, which is, according to the first approach, ipseity (huwiyya), and according to the second, divinity (ilahiyya)', in the same way it is, according to the first expression, existence (wujud), and according to the second, name (ism) and attribute (sifa). This is probably the key leading to a correct understanding of the ontological distinction Avicenna introduced in his interpretation of the first aya of Surat al-Ikhlas: the unknown and unknowable huwiyya of the Necessary Existent reveals itself through the attributes of His divinity. Avicenna could therefore be considered as a main source of what was to become a major topic in later Sufi and Twelver Shici theology: the distinction between the Deus absconditus and the Deus revelatus, to use Corbin's terminology.52 Further investigations are needed before we will be able to fully measure the influence of Avicenna's philosophical reading of the Qur'an on later tafsir. Much further research is also necessary before we may answer the question raised at the beginning of this article: to what extent Avicenna's metaphysics were influenced by his reading and understanding of the Qur'an? For the time being, our study of his Qur'anic commentaries clearly shows that the references to the Qur'an occuring in his philosophical works are not just superficial and secondary 'foreign' elements in his thought.

Except for a few references taken from Goichon's Lexique and Distinction, neither of these authors make use of Avicenna's Tafsir. 10 Ibn Sina, Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas, p. 106. In Avicenna's technical terminology, the 'concomitant' (lazim, pi. lawazim) is 'that quality which necessarily attaches to the</page><page sequence="12">Avicenna's Philosophical Approach to the Qur'an 145 essence - by virtue of the essence - yet without being a constituent of the essence' (Shams C. Inati, Ibn Sina. Remarks and Admonitions. Part One: Logic (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1984), p. 17). In other terms, the lazim is a 'necessary attribute of a given quiddity'; cf. Tiana Koutzarova, Das Transzendentale bei Ibn Sina. Zur Metaphysik als Wissenschaft erster Begriffs- und Urteilsprinzipien, Islamic Philosophy, Theology and Science: Texts and Studies, 79 (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2009), who translates lazim as 'notwendiges Attribut der Washeiten': 'Fur die Begriffsinhalte "Seiend" und "Eines" verwendet Ibn Slna im allgemeinen, d.h. bei der Bestimmung ihres Verhaltnisses zu den Washeiten als solchen ... den Ausdruck lawazin, der als "Attribute" oder "untrennbar folgenden Bestimmungen" wiedergegeben werden kann' (p. 123). In this first part of his Tafsir, Avicenna thus states that the Necessary Existent cannot be named and known in Himself, but only through the concomitants that by necessity proceed from Him. 11 Ibn Sina, Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas, p. 107. This is common Avicennian doctrine: the Necessary Existent has no constituents as He is free from any kind of composition, such as matter and form, genus and differentia, etc.; cf. Wolf son, 'Avicenna', pp. 143-4. 12 Ibn Slna, Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas, p. 107, lines 16-19. 13 On the technical meaning of tacrif in Avicenna's writings, see Goichon, Lexique, p. 221. 14 This puzzling sentence has an exact parallel in the Kitab al-isharat, ed. Sulayman Dunya, Dhakha3ir al-cArab, 22 (4 vols, Cairo: Dar al-Macarif, 1985), vol. 3, p. 278 Cfl silsilat al-tartib al-ndzil min cindahu tulan wa-cardan") where it appears in a similar context related to the emanation of a hierarchy of beings (including the cosmic Intelligences) out of the Necessary Existent. Naslr al-DIn al-Tusi comments on this passage as follows (also p. 278): 'the science of the First is an act that belongs to Him by His essence and this science encompasses the totality of the existents. He apprehends intellectually what succeeds to Him in the order of being, namely the first caused existent, which, in its turn, is the cause of what succeeds to it in the order of being. Knowing a cause perfectly means to know all the concomitants that necessarily proceed from this cause. Thus, the First apprehends intellectually all the things caused by the first caused existent, because all these things belong to a chain of beings that proceed from the first caused existent and end at it. This descending chain can be either vertical (tulan) or horizontal (cardari).y By 'vertical', al-Tusi means the chain of the caused beings that are put in an order ending at the first caused existent. By 'horizontal', he means the chain of accidents (hawadith) that are put in an order not ending directly at the first caused existent, but nevertheless related to it insofar as this chain of accidents needs the first caused existent in order to exist. This need is like a transversal link that establishes a kind of equality between all the elements of the horizontal chain with respect to God. Thus, for al-Tusi, the contingency of the accidents is reduced by this horizontal link between the accidents and the first caused existent. The whole passage should be taken into account when interpreting Avicenna's theory of God's knowledge of the particulars. It has to be noticed that al-Tusi does not use here the term acrad for 'accidents', but rather hawadith, obviously in order to avoid confusion with cardan (as have some modern scholars; cf. Janssens, 'Avicenna and the Qur3an', p. 188). The distinction between a vertical and a horizontal emanation was later adopted by al-Suhrawardi in his doctrine about the emanation of light; see his Kitab hikmat al-ishrdq, ed. Henry Corbin in Suhrawardi.

Neoplatonisme et gnose ismaelienne dans Vceuvre de Hamid ad-Din al-Kirmani (Xe/XIe s.), Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta, 67 (Louvain: Peeters, 1995), pp. 35-6, pp. 177-80, pp. 195-6. An anonymous IsmacIlI ta?wll of Surat al-Ikhlas, published by Rudolph Strothmann (Gnosis-Texte der Ismailiten (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck, 1943), pp. 39-40) goes even further by affirming that the whole sura does not refer at all to the Creator (mubdic), but only to the first created being (al-mubdac al-awwal), i.e. the Intellect. 48 Avicenna has devoted another of his works to cilm al-tawhid, namely the Risala al-cArshiyya (ed. Ibrahim Halal (Cairo: Jamicat al-Azhar, n.d.)), written for 'some people' who had asked him to compose a treatise about the truthfulness of cilm al-tawhid. The doctrine he developes here about God's attributes is different from the one exposed in his Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas. In the cArshiyya, God's attributes are described as 'not being added to His essence' Csifatuhu la takuna za Jida cala dhatihV, p. 21). He next states that if the attributes were added to the essence, they would be in potentiality and the essence of God would be a cause for them, thus preceding them. He concludes that all the attributes are either 'negative', or 'relative' or 'a combination of both' (p. 23). However, he does not seem to make an ontological distinction between God's ipseity and His attributes. Rather than supposing a shift in Avicenna's doctrine about the divine attributes, it seems that the discrepancy between the two works is due to a difference of perspective. In Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas the perspective is strictly ontological, as is proved by its terminology: Avicenna uses here philosophical terms such as 'ipseity' and 'concomitant', without mentioning 'creation' at all, whereas in the cArshiyya he uses the terms 'essence' (dhat) and 'attributes' (sifdt) and refers to 'creation.' Avicenna appears here to have a more 'traditional' approach, aiming to show that there is no multiplicity in God's essence, as His attributes are all related to His knowledge of creation. In consequence, we cannot reach His essence through His attributes. 49 Hamza and Rizvi, Anthology, p. 493; see al-RazI, al-Tafsir al-kabir, vol. 32, pp. 164-5, and the translation in Hamza and Rizvi, Anthology, pp. 543-4.</page><page sequence="15">148 Journal of Qur'anic Studies 50 Hamza and Rizvi, Anthology, p. 493; see Ibn cArabI (to whom the text was traditionally attributed), Tafsir al-QurJdn al-karim, ed.
