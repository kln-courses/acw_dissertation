<plain_text><page sequence="1">VICTOR WITTER TURNER: A BIBLIOGRAPHY (1952-1975) Henry G. Barnard, compiler Library School, National Library of New Zealand INTRODUCTION This bibliography was originally developed for students of the anthropological study of religion at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand and at Auckland, Massey, and Otago Universities. Although all of Victor Turner's major publications and many of his minor ones between 1952 and 1975 have been included in this bibliography, it is possible that some of his shorter re views have been overlooked. The principal method of compilation was bibliographic coupling; that is, working from the references in one source to those in another. Sources consulted included The Social Sciences Citation Index, Sociological Abstracts, the So cial Sciences and Humanities Index, Abstracts in Anthropology, Current Anthropology, and the Book Review Index (for reviews by and about Victor Turner). In addition, the indexes of a number of journals in anthropology and the comparative study of religion were examined. Whenever possible, reviews of Turner's major works by other authors have been included. This list of reviews is by no means comprehensive, and is meant only as a guide. Abstracts of arti cles and references to reprinted works have been included whenev er possible, although these are likewise not necessarily compre hensive. The arrangement of the main section of the bibliography is chronological by date of publication. Although this format is meant to show the development of Turner's ideas and the changing nature of his interests, it must be treated with caution since delays in publication, reprinting, and other factors have result ed in an imperfect chronological framework. A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO VICTOR TURNER'S WORK The work of Victor Turner is now recognized as among the best arising from the discipline of anthropology in recent de cades. Although Turner's influence has been principally in the study of religion, his works on political anthropology have also been the basis of wide discussion. Victor Witter Turner was born in 1919 in Glasgow, Scotland. In 1949, he completed an honors undergraduate degree in anthro</page><page sequence="2">208 ANTHROPOLOGICA N.S. 27(1-2) 1985 pology at the University of London under Professors Daryll Forde and Meyer Fortes. Between 1950 and 1954, he was a Research Offi cer at the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute in Rhodesia (now Zambia). During that period, he conducted fieldwork among the Lunda-Ndembu people in northern Rhodesia. In 1955, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Manchester, and in 1957, his thesis was pub lished as a book titled Schism and Continuity in an African Soci ety: A Study of Ndembu Village Life. From 1954 to 1960, Turner worked at the University of Manchester, first as a Senior Fellow and later as Senior Lecturer. During that period, Professor Max Gluckman, a former Director of the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute whose theories influenced Turner, especially in the initial stages of his work, was head of the Depaartment of Anthropology at Manchester. Around Gluckman grew up what came to be known as the "Manchester school" of British social anthropology. Members of this school included John Barnes, A. L. Epstein, Clyde Mitchell, and Dorothy Emmet as the school's "mascot" philosopher. Turner was first identified with this school, and his later interests and ideas continued to be linked to the school's influence. In 1961, Turner was appointed a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, Califor nia. This opportunity was used to write The Drums of Affliction: A Study of Religious Processes Among the Ndembu of Zambia, pub lished in 1968. Although Turner returned to the University of Manchester a year later, he remained deeply attracted to the free-wheeling, multi-disciplinary atmosphere of American academic life. In 1964 he accepted a position as Professor of Anthropology at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and remained in this post for four years, conducting three months of fieldwork among the Gisu of Uganda (July-September, 1966). In 1969, Turner joined the six-member Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. Colleagues on the committee included the novelist Saul Bellow, the philosopher Hannah Arendt, and the art critic Harold Rosenberg. In 1977, Turner was appoint ed William R. Kenan Professor of Anthropology at the University of Virginia, a post which he held until his death in December 1983. During the 1970s, Turner also conducted fieldwork on pil grimage in Mexico and Ireland. His latter years were devoted to studying the interplay between ritual and contemporary drama theory. This brief sketch of Victor Turner's academic and profes sional career is meant as an introduction to the major themes which developed in his work. The origins of these themes were multifarious, and were as much related to his personal history as to the influence of his background. First, there is the theme of "society" as an evolutionary mechanism which exists to combat humankind's "innate and universal drives whose complete gratifi cation would result in a breakdown of (social) control" (The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual 1967:37). Turner also</page><page sequence="3">Barnard BIBLIOGRAPHY: 1952-1975 209 spoke of the "forces of disorder that . . . inhere in man's mam malian constitution" (The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti Structure 1969:93). This Hobbesian view of bellum omnes contra omnes is a theme which pervades his work and is more often than not implicit. This is not to say that Turner consistently thought through the consequences of this idea. Indeed, since the conse quences of the idea were taken for granted, they evaded his sci entific scrutiny. The result is that at times, he seems to sug gest that "self-interest" is a significant factor in understand ing capitalist societies, and that at other times it is signifi cant for all societies. But he also sometimes suggests that it is society itself that is disruptive. In this vein, he speaks of the "failure ... of the secular mechanisms to redress and absorb conflicts that arise in and between local and kinship groups" (Schism and Continuity in an African Society: A Study of Ndembu Village Life 1957:289), and of "the social forces working in the opposite direction" from that of societal unity (ibid.:295). This idea culminates in his statement that "structural differentia tion, both vertical and horizontal is the foundation of strife and factionalism" (The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Struc ture 1969:179). The second theme that runs through Turner's work is related to the first. Turner saw ritual as one of the principal mechanisms that society has evolved for maintaining the social order. He stated that "in the course of a ritual, symbols and verbal behavior are manipulated so as to discharge tensions in the social system" (Schism and Continuity in an African Society: A Study of Ndembu Village Life 1957:316), and that "ritual is situated near the apex of a whole hierarchy of redressive and regulative institutions that correct deflections and deviations from customary prescribed behavior" (The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual 1967:45). To discover how ritual ful fills its function, Turner explored various methods of analyzing rituals and ritual symbols. This exploration suggested a number of other themes. Victor Turner stressed not only the need to analyze rituals and ritual symbols by looking at their external forms, observable characteristics, and sociological contexts, but also the need to take into account the interpretations offered by native special ists and laymen?that is, native exegesis. By using all of these data, Turner discovered three properties of ritual symbols: (1) condensation?the ability of ritual symbols to "stand for" or "represent" many things and actions in a single formation; (2) unification of disparate significata?or the idea that very dif ferent categories and actions are often held together in one sym bol by the common possession of analogous properties; and (3) polarization of meaning?how the various "meanings" of a symbol can be spread out on a spectrum or fan from a normative pole to a sensory or orectic pole* The meanings of a given symbol at its normative pole are seen as usually connected with principles of</page><page sequence="4">210 ANTHROPOLOGICA N.S. 27(1-2) 1985 social behavior, while the meanings of symbols at their sensory poles are usually seen as physiological characters. It is this last propaerty of ritual symbols which provides Turner with another of the major themes in his work, namely, the ability of ritual symbols to unite intimately the moral and the material by conflating the normative with the sensory. Thus "an exchange of qualities may take place in the psyches of the parti cipants under the stimulating circumstances of the ritual perfor mance, between orectic and normative poles; the former, through its association with the latter, becomes purged of its infantile and regressive character, while the normative pole becomes charged" with the power of the grossly physiological (The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual 1967:54-55). Turner was interested in analyzing both the semantic and sociological dimensions of rituals and ritual symbolism. Since he saw ritual as a phase in social process, he developed a "drama tic" mode of analysis which stressed the "processual" nature of social life. This analysis was an especially strong theme in Schism and Continuity in an African Society: A Study of Ndembu Village Life (1957), where he attempted to extract the formal properties of ritual processes, including breaches of norms, crisis resolution or dissolution, and other such categories. Turner's emphasis on "process" also led him to examine the "processual" nature of rituals themselves, leaning heavily at the start on Van Gennep's "rites of passage." Following Van Gennep, Turner discerned three phases in rituals: separation, margin (or limen), and aggregation. Concentrating on the liminal phase of rituals, Turner described and evaluated the common symbolic fea tures of rituals. His concern with the properties of "liminal" phenomena provided the major theme for such works as The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure (1969), and Dramas, Fields, and Metaphors: Symbolic Action in Human Society (1974). Eventual ly, Turner moved from an analysis of the symbolism of the liminal phase of "primitive" rituals to the analysis of liminal phases in such broader social processes as millenarian movements and pil grimage processes. Here, he discerned similar structural and anti-structural characteristics and was led to the development of the concept of communitas, or society seen as a relatively un structured, undifferentiated commitatus, community, or even communion of equal individuals. Since the themes which occupied the focal point of Turner's interests were "liminal" and "communitas" phenomena on a world wide scale, he eventually sought these themes not only in social processes, but also in art and literature.</page><page sequence="5">Barnard BIBLIOGRAPHY: 1952-1975 211 AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF VICTOR TURNER (1952-1975) N.B.: Unless otherwise noted, the following works were authored by Victor Turner. 1952 The Lozi Peoples of North-Western Rhodesia.

Muchona was Turner's best informant on these matters, and Muchona's descriptions were enhanced by his obvious de light in speculating about his own religious world and the meanings of its symbols. Muchona's wit found a ready re sponse in Turner, who spent eight months in exhilarating, quick-fire talk with Muchona and an Ndembu school-teacher named Windson. In this article, Turner also describes Mu chona 's social and psychological background as a marginal man and tries to explain why Muchona became a diviner.

Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. For Ndembu diviners, the items of their divining appa ratus are more like signs than symbols, and the diviners' knowledge of the meanings of the items are more esoteric and conscious than those of ordinary laypersons. In this case, a sign is an analogous or abbreviated expression of a known thing, whereas a symbol is the best possible ex pression of a relatively unknown fact which is neverthe less recognized or postulated as existing. The Ndembu diviner discloses what has already happened and does not foretell future events. He is a member of society who is called upon in moments of crisis to isolate the physical and social causes of misfortunes. As an agent of redress and social adjustment, he locates tensions in the contem porary social structure. By exonerating and accusing in dividuals, he brings moral norms to the surface and re states them, and also prescribes actions which will dis sipate tensions that have accumulated in the social structure. Turner exemplifies these ideas with detailed case studies of divinations which he observed. 1961 Ritual Symbolism, Morality and Social Structure Among the Ndembu.

Symbols make beliefs, ideas, values, sentiments, and psychological dispositions that cannot be directly per ceived visible, audible, and tangible. Symbols are also multivocal, standing for many things at the same time. The meanings of symbols can be spread out on a continuum or fan from the orectic (biological and emotional) pole to the cognitive paole. Turner considers this polarity to be a universal feature of ritual symbols of any semantic com plexity. Through this polarity, an exchange of qualities takes place between the two poles of a symbol: (1) the orectic pole is purged of its anti-social elements through its association with the cognitive and normative; and (2) the normative pole is charged with the biological and emo tional effects of the orectic. In brief, a single symbol represents both the obligatory and the desirable, a union of the moral and the biological.

Here, in concentrating on the various performers, the objects used, and explanations which the performers give for both their actions and the objects they use, Turner gives a step-by step account of the ritual. Unlike his other analyses, he does not go into the social setting of the ritual, but in stead concentrates on the content of its meaning. He iso lates Kavula, one of the male nature-spirits, for special attention and explores the meaning and function of Kavula in his ritual setting. Then, through a cross-cultural com paarison with other isolates from different cultures, such as Jesus and Moby Dick, he attempts to give a theological explanation of the ritual.

For the Ndembu, hunting is a religious activity in ad dition to a search for food which is given an importance far beyond the physical needs which it fulfills. Turner analyzes various ritual symbols, especially the chishinga, and reveals the multivocal nature of these symbols from three levels of interpretation: (1) the exegetical; (2) the operational; and (3) the positional. These symbols act as unitary powers which conflate all the powers that are inherent in the activities, objects, relationships, and ideas which they represent.

"In his seminal essay The Rites of Passage, Arnold Van Gennep characterized a class of rituals with three succes sive and distinct moments in ritual time: separation, mar gin, and aggregation. Working within Van Gennep's frame work, Turner concentrates on the properties of the hither to neglected, and supposedly amorphous, period in rites of passage, the marginal or liminal period. Initiation rites have particularly well-marked liminal periods, where neo phytes typically are removed, secluded, darkened, hidden, without rank or insignia; in terms of social structure, neophytes are invisible. In effect, the initiate is 'be twixt and between,' neither here nor there, no longer a child and not yet an adult. During this period of transi tion between states symbolic themes characteristically concern death and decomposition, or gestation and parturi tion, referring to the culturally defined person the ini tiate has been and will become. Because of the economy of symbolic reference, the opposed states?the having been and the becoming?may be represented by a single object, act, or phrase.

Reprinted in 1967 in The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual by Victor Turner, pp. 299-358. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. The Ndembu conceive of disease as a species of misfor tune caused by mystical forces which are directed by con scious agents. To counter these forces, diviners are em ployed to diagnose and recommend curative rituals. Mis fortune is considered to be a black state, and the rituals which are used to restore a normal state of affairs are full of the symbolism of color. This article includes an inventory of diseases and their treatments for everything from bilharziasis and leprosy to backache and abscesses. An analysis of the symbolism of these rituals shows how they are influenced by ultimate and axiomatic values of Ndembu religion and ethics. A major point of the paper is how their beliefs about diseases and cures give the Ndembu a false sense of confidence about their ability to cope with disease. 1964 An Ndembu Doctor in Practice.

Turner states: "Emotion is roused and then stripped of its illicit and antisocial quality, but nothing of its intensity, its quantitative aspect, has been lost in the transformation. Ndembu social norms and values, expressed in symbolic objects and actions, are saturated with this generalised emotion, which itself be comes ennobled through contact with these norms and val ues.

This is one of Turner's major statements on the study of ritual symbolism. Ritual is prescribed, formal behavior for occasions not given over to technological routine, and it refers to beliefs in mystical beings or powers. Symbols are things which the general consensus regards as natural ly typifying, representing, or recalling something either by possession of analogous qualities, or by association in fact or thought. Ritual symbols can be analyzed from the standpoint of three classes of data: (1) the external form; (2) the native interpretation; and (3) significant contexts worked out by the anthropologist. These symbols can be further classified by their properties: (a) conden sation or multivocality; (b) unification of disparate sig nificata; and (c) polarization of meaning. Rituals adapt and periodically readapt the biophysical individual to the basic conditions and axiomatic values of human social life. Because of their properties, ritual symbols make the obligatory desirable. Since rituals are part of broad so cial processes, they should be studied as forces in a field of social action, and not merely as part of an ab stract unitary system. Turner eschews psychological inter pretations of ritual symbolism not because they are irrel evant, but because he thinks that an anthropologist cannot pass judgment "in a field of inquiry in which he has nei ther received systematic training nor obtained thorough practical experience."

Two types of analysis are applied to both systems, one concentrating on the ideological structure of religions, and the other on social situations where religious beliefs and practices significantly affect behavior.

This paper was first delivered as a contribution to a conference on "New Approaches in Social Anthropology," sponsored by the Association of Social Anthropologists in 1963. The revival of interest in primitive forms of class ification is paointed out. Turner found that among the Ndembu of Zambia, every form of dualism was contained in a wider, tripartite mode of classification relating to the colors white, red, and black. He describes the use of these colors in rituals among the Ndembu, Ngone, and other African societies, and extracts the meanings of these colors in those societies. Turning to comparative materi als from Africa, Malaya, Australia, North America, and India, as well as to data from archaeological literature, he points out the universality of the meanings of these colors. He also attempts to link the cultural meanings of these three colors with their "natural" symbolism in a socio-physiological hypothesis. "By representing forces or strands of life by colour symbols in a ritual context, men have felt that they could domesticate or control these forces for social ends, but the forces and the symbols for them are biologically, psychologically, and logically prior to social classification by moieties, clans, sex totems and all the rest."

Chicago, Illi nois: Aldine Publishing Company. Society is a process with some systematic characteris tics rather than a closely integrated system. Disputes in society have a life cycle, successive situations of this cycle being characterized as "political," "ritual," or "economic," depending on the routines, procedures, and symbols used in the situation. A social situation is a critical point or complication in the history of a group, and intervening situations leave their imprint on subse quent patterns of behavior. Turner demonstrates these ideas by describing the struggle between two factions of a vicinage to fill the role of senior circumciser at a per formance of the Mukunda circumcision ritual. He shows how when the situation was defined politically, it was the modernist group that seemed to have the upper hand, where as when the dispute entered its ritual phase, the tradi tionalists became paramount. 1966 Sorcery in Its Social Setting: A Review Article. African Social Research 2:159-164. In this review of M. G.

However, Marwick is criticized for his tendency to use the case method as "apt illustration" rather than to probe the properties of spatio-tempaoral continua. Marwick has failed to provide an in-depth study of the vicissitudes of life in one community over an extended period of time. Never theless, this work marks the culmination of a passing epoch in anthropological research. 1966 The Syntax of Symbolism in an African Ritual.

This article was delivered as a contribution to a sym posium titled "A discussion on ritualization of behavior in animals and man." Here, Turner once again describes the analytical tools he has developed for the study of reli gion, the various dimensions of significance (exegetic, operational, and positional), and the way the meaning of symbol is built up in the exegetic dimension (on the nomi nal, artifactual, and substantial basis). He demonstrates the use of these concepts in an analysis of the mukula tree, which exudes a dusky red gum from cracks in its bark. Using this analysis, he demonstrates the complex re lationship between innate human propensities and cultural mechanisms.

Verrier Elwin's book, The Religion of an Indian Tribe, is criticized for its lack of a sociological dimension in its analysis of Saora ritual. Elwin sees Saora religion "as an attempt to make the mystery and horror of the un seen more bearable." Turner states that this explanation might be adequate for the theologian or the psychologist, but not for the anthropologist. Using Elwin's data, he tries to extract the social elements of Saora religion, but is hampered most of the way by the lack of relevant material in Elwin's work.

This article is the only new piece in Turner's collec tion of essays titled The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual (see above). It is another detailed, step by-step account of one paarticular ritual?in this case a life-crisis ritual, which is to be distinguished from rituals of affliction. Unlike Turner's analysis of Chihamba ritual (see Chihamba, the White Spirit: A Ritual Drama of the Ndembu 1962, above), he returns to a socio logical explanation of ritual behavior and symbols. The social background of the ritual performance and detailed genealogical and spatial studies are provided.

This article is a brief review of main trends in the development of theories about religion, from evolutionist hypotheses (Tylor, Frazer, Freud, and Durkheim) to func tionalist and current hypotheses. The "meaning of reli gion" is stressed, and there is a brief discussion of some of the principal religious ideas and practices in primi tive societies, including cults of the dead, the High God, and polytheism. Attention is given to the development of Judaism as a unique religion and as a precursor of Chris tianity. 1968 The Drums of Affliction: A Study of Religious Processes Among the Ndembu of Zambia.

This work begins with a discussion of ritual in the broad terms of its symbolic structure, its aims, and its implications for social relationships. Some background information about Ndembu cosmology, social structure, and the dynamics of social cohesion and conflict is provided. This is followed by an extended description of the basic concepts of Ndembu divination (for more detail, see Ndembu Divination: Its Symbolism and Techniques 1961) by which the Ndembu determine the various causes of misfortune, and hence the kind of ritual to be used in removing this. The main body of the book is divided into two sections. The first section describes a set of rituals of affliction in the context of an extended case history of those in volved.

International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences 10:576-582. David L. Sills, ed. New York: Macmil lan. The liminal aspect of myths has two dimensions: (1) they are often narrated and are most effectively known in liminal situations of rites of passage; and (2) they them selves refer to passages, of "how things came to be what they are." They are not merely charters of the social or der in positive or negative ways; rather they are "deep mysteries which put the initiand temporarily into close rapport with the primacy or primordial generative powers of the cosmos." Turner points out that many authors, in cluding Malinowski, Jung, and Eliade, have each stressed the reality of myths in their own way. 1968 Religious Specialists: Anthropological Study.

Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. In the Dogon mythico-cosmological system, every element is interwoven with every other in a fine tapaestry of sym bols and ideas. This tapestry is the result of a set of correspondences between "the human form divine" and the rest of the universe. As Calame-Griaule says, "Man seeks his reflection in all mirrors of an anthropomorphic uni verse." Calame-Griaule's work stresses the order to be found in process and structure. Turner says that the so cial order he sought and found through his own fieldwork was seen as the result of social action rather than of knowledge, the latter varying with social situations. He confesses that he might have been extreme in his stress on the systematizing effect of social processes and admits that he has now found more order and consistency in Ndembu expressive culture. However, he suggests that Calame Griaule has gone to the opposite extreme, and by stressing the cognitive or intellectual level of Dogon culture, has neglected the study of the social processes which make "day-to-day social adjustments possible." 1968 Review of Thresholds of Initiation by Joseph L.

In this article, Turner returns to themes raised in previous articles, principally his work on color symbolism and liminality. First, from a comparison between symbols used by a traditional Zulu diviner in a ritual performed on one side of a river with those employed by a Zulu Zion ist prophet in a ritual at the same time on the other side of the river, Turner abstracts the common properties and meanings of the symbolism of the color white and of water. He then compares these to similar symbols in ancient reli</page><page sequence="21">Barnard BIBLIOGRAPHY: 1952-1975 227 gions. This comparison points out a remarkable constancy in basic values ascribed to the symbolism. Three questions are raised, discussed, and tentatively answered: (1) Why does whiteness, which represents, interalia, purity, and purification, also have connections with sexual and bodily fluids such as semen and maternal waters? (2) What connec tion, if any, does symbolism maintain with social struc ture? and (3) What is the relationship between clusters of symbols used in traditional religious systems in stable societies and in similar clusters of symbols in new reli gious movements where societies are undergoing rapid change? 1969 Forms of Symbolic Action: Introduction.

Seattle, Washington and London, Eng land: University of Washington Press for the American Ethnological Society. This introduction to a symposium on symbolic action is one of Turner's most complete statements on his theoreti cal position regarding the analysis of ritual symbols. His method of analysis in previous articles is once again pre sented here. Society is seen as existing to counter the forces of disorder that are inherent in the mammalian con stitution of humans?Hobbes' bellum omnes contra omnes* Rituals put these very forces of disorder at the service of order, uniting the normative and the orectic through key symbols. There is also a discussion of the various papers presented at the symposium.

Moving from detailed analyses of rituals among the Ndembu of Zambia to a discussion of millenarian movements, marginality, rituals of reversal, communes, and much more, Turner introduces and expands the themes of liminality and "communitas"; that is, society when it manifests itself as a relatively unstructured, undifferentiated comitatus, community, or even communion of equal individuals. These are themes which Turner briefly touched on in previous works, and which occupied the central position in the de velopment of his ideas from the moment they were published here. This book is full of briefly-stated theories about the symbolism, dialectics, and meaning of the concepts of</page><page sequence="22">228 ANTHROPOLOGICA N.S. 27(1-2) 1985 liminality and communitas.

London: Tavistock Publications (distributed in North America by Barnes and Noble, New York). A comparison of key symbolic features of the rites surrounding male circumcision in two widely-separated Bantu-speaking societies, the Gisu of Uganda and the Ndembu of Zambia. Turner uses data from his own fieldwork among the Ndembu and from Dr. Jean La Fontaine's studies of the Gisu. He compares the ritual employment of "two symbol triads": finger millet yeast, chyme, and mud by the Gisu; and three species of trees, with their typical ex cretions, by the Ndembu. As is the case elsewhere in Tur ner's work, the meaning of these symbols must be found by "considering them in their operational social settings," and as indices and agents of social change. Turner care fully analyzes the circumcision rites of the two societies and the symbols they use in the context of contrasting social tensions. He concludes that Gisu circumcision rites serve to assimilate all other principles, including prin ciples of consanguinity, affinity, and territoriality, to the central Gisu principle of patrilineality. At the same time, these rites liberate the novice from specific paater nal authority. Among the matrilineal but virilocal Ndembu, circumcision rites sharply separate bonds between men from bonds between men and women. Ndembu circumcision rites stress paternity of a "maternal" rather than an authori tarian kind as a mediating link between local family ties (such as a matrilineage) as well as between the broader unities of vicinage and tribe.

The relationship between cultural themes and ritual symbols is discussed with particular reference to an Ndembu hunter's burial ritual. Once again, the character istics of ritual symbols and ways of analyzing them are presented.

Dorothy Emmet is a philosopher who was very involved with the seminars of the anthropology department at Man chester University in the 1950s while Turner was there. Turner was influenced by her, and relied on her for philo sophical justification of his own excursions from the mainstream of anthropological theory. Her formulation: "A society is a process with some systematic characteristics, rather than a closely integrated system like an organism or a machine," was particularly congenial to Turner's own thought, since he had rebelled against contemporary struc tural-functionalist approaches to the study of society. 1972 Passages, Margins, and Poverty: Religious Symbols of Com munitas.

This article can be regarded as the ultimate synthesis in abbreviated form of Turner's work on African rituals. Rituals are pervasive in Africa and can be classified as: (1) seasonal or (2) contingent, including (a) life crisis and (b) rituals of affliction. Each African society has its own finite number of rituals drawn variously from these categories. Symbols in the rituals have the follow ing attributes: (1) multiple meanings; (2) unification of apparently disparate significata; (3) condensation, where many things are represented simultaneously; and (4) polar ization of significata, where the meanings are on a con tinuum from a normative or ideological pole to an orectic or sensory pole. These symbols may represent a number of themes. Symbols that are extremely multivocal and central to a ritual are called dominant symbols, and tend to recur from ritual to ritual. Whichever of the many meanings of a symbol is the theme of a particular ritual depends on its relation to other symbols in the whole situation. Actors in a given ritual experience symbols as powers and mean ings. These symbols have three dimensions: (1) the exege tic; (2) the operational; and (3) the positional. They also vary in the degree to which they correspond with each other from culture to culture. Among West African cultures such as the Dogon, everything is a symbol of everything else. However, social action in response to material pres sures is always the systematic and systematizing factor. These ritual symbols are still efficacious in contemporary culture, as is witnessed by the imagery to be found in the writings of modern African novelists and in the rhetoric of politicians. 1973- Symbol, Myth, and Ritual Series.
