Schomburg-Scherff Abstract. - People of different cultures European as well as non-European ascribe most incredible powers to images, which seem to transcend the material attributes, the dead matter of pictorial representations. How can one tentatively explain the seductive, suggestive, "magical" power of images anthropo- logically, from the point of view of image producers and perceivers? There are several approaches possible: analyzing widespread conceptions of power, of souls, of the "magic" of similarity, and the cognition and perception of the identity of representation and represented.

People of different cultures, past and present, have ascribed and still ascribe most incredible attri- butes, abilities, and effects to images (paintings, sculptures, masks, photographs). South American Indians believe, for example, that anthropomorphic figures carved from wood are living beings as Zer- ries has noted (1973/74). In North America among Algonquin groups certain wooden sculptures can hear. As Harrington (1921:45) has shown these wooden sculptures understand what they are told, have the power to ensure the health of their owner, and are pleased to be given gifts. Art historians like Freedberg (1991: 33) or Bruneau (1999: 26 f.) inform us that in the early days of ancient Greece cult images were regarded as the residence of the deity. Their main task was to guarantee the presence of the deity and they were worshipped as such themselves. These wooden figures were capable of mobility. To keep them from leaving and thus withdrawing their protection they were chained, fixed to a base in the temple, or repre- sented without feet. In many parts of the world images are treated like living beings: They are looked after, washed, cleansed, anointed, dressed, fed, nursed, and kissed. Roy (1997:117) gives an example from Africa: Among the Yoruba in Nigeria if twins are born and one of them dies a so-called twin-figure (ibeji) is carved from wood and taken care of by the mother in the same way as the living child. For instance, the mother feeds the wooden image, dresses it, presents it with gifts, dyes its hair blue-black, rubs red oil on its "skin," and decorates it with ornaments until the surviving child is old enough to look after his twin-figure himself. Very often supernatural powers, spirits, gods, or saints are inherent in images which thereby are endowed with special powers, e.g., to influence growth, fertility, or heal- ing, to work wonders, to make wishes come true, or to cause harm. Images are capable of moving spectators to tears, giving comfort, rousing sexual desires, or giving rise to militant and destructive actions. Images perspire, bleed, weep, secrete milk and semen. They are said to have the power to steal the soul of human beings, to frighten and terrify people, or to cause their death. For fear of their power images are manipulated, censored, changed, veiled, attacked, pulled down, even destroyed.</page><page sequence="2">1 90 Sylvia M. Schomburg-Scherff By what means and why have images been in the past and are still being today vested the world over with powers which seem to transcend their material attributes, their dead matter? Which theories of images, which conceptions of power or magic underlie the belief in the efficacy of images? How are images made to function, how are they vitalized, and in which contexts are they used? These are, in my opinion, extraordinarily interest- ing questions but there are hardly any satisfying answers to them. The raw material to be found in European and non-European histories of images is enormous, varied, seemingly insurmountable but has not been investigated much by anthropolo- gists. Of course, since the 1960s there exists a growing amount of field studies which concentrate on images of specific societies and which could serve as detailed, contextual bases for comparative research. But as far as I know such a systematic study transgressing cultural boundaries has not yet been tackled. Former Approaches to the Anthropological Study of Images Before I turn to new approaches to the anthro- pological study of images I shall roughly sketch and comment on former ones. In the short his- tory of anthropology as an academic discipline spanning hardly one century the study of images has never been at the centre of research interests. Art and aesthetics, as the topic has been named conventionally during the last decades, constituted - in the words of Anderson (1990:6) - "an unexplored territory," a liminal region between anthropology and art history. This situation has changed a little since the 1960s, 1970s. Quite a few field researches have been carried out, mostly in Africa. Anthropologists have studied art, aesthet- ics, and criticism in non-European societies, the relationship between art and society, the role of the artist, etc. Nevertheless, the study of images has remained rather marginal, of secondary importance within mainstream anthropology. Representatives of political or social anthropology - subdivisions of the discipline that seemingly are concerned with more solid facts - hardly ever refer to research results from the anthropology of art, as Coote and Shelton (1992: 3) have argued recently. Yet, the very materiality of pictorial representations offers a unique approach to the study of social, political, or spiritual phenomena. As several stud- ies of the last two decades have been able to demonstrate,1 images can be used as a means to begin a conversation with different members of a specific ethnic group. Images can be used to explore the ways these members, differentiated for instance by gender, age, or status, perceive an image, react to it, give it meaning, use or produce it - in different places and at different times. As Morphy (1994: 662 f.) has pointed out, with the aid of visual representations anthropolo- gists are in a position to uncover the structure of systems of knowledge, power, and meaning. To give only a few examples: Nancy Munn (1973) and Howard Morphy himself (1991) successfully used this method in the context of Australian Aborigines, Susan Vogel (1980) among the West African Baule, Barbara Keifenheim (1987, 1998) among the Kashinawa of Peru. There are many reasons why things we classify as "fine arts" did not receive much attention by academic anthropology during the most part of the 20th century, mostly of an epistemological and methodological nature. As they are discussed in almost every introduction to the anthropology of art,2 I do not analyze them here in any de- tail. One of the main reasons, I think, - and I take up a point suggested by Ingold (1994:331) and developed further by van Damme (1996: 39- 134) - has to be seen in the dominant tendency not to define anthropology in terms of its both cross-cultural, comparative as well as contextual, holistic perspective but in terms of its object: be it the study of non-European societies, of strange or exotic cultures, of differences, or of the "Other." This tendency is subject to the danger of constructing or stylizing "others" as "totally different others" - "ganz andere" in the words of von Kittlitz (1994:9) - and of contrasting their ways of living with "Western" forms. We do not have to go back to cultural evolutionist discourses of the 19th century which constructed "savages" in contrast to "civilized people" and which conceived for example masks or ancestral figures from other parts of the world as "curious pieces of evidence of the world of the primitive," as Benzing has noted (1978: 23). Until today dichotomies like, on the one hand, "our scientific thinking," on the other "their religious beliefs," "our technology - their magic," or "our art - their cult objects" substantiate the discursive separation between the West and the rest of the world. 1 For example Munn 1973; Morphy 1991; Rouch 1982; Keifenheim 1987, 1998; Behrend 1990; Wendl 1998. 2 See, for example, Van Damme 1996; Morphy 1994; Coote and Shelton 1992; Schomburg-Scherff 1986. Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="3">The Power of Images 1 9 1 The tendency to define anthropology as the study of foreign, non-European, or non- Western cultures has also led anthropologists till very re- cently, with a few exceptions,3 to ignore European art, the art of white America and the so called "fine arts" of Asia as a potential object of anthropologi- cal research. But only an anthropology of Western art also, i.e., fundamentally of all art worlds, can be, as Wolbert (1998: 193) has emphasized, considered as the basis of a symmetrical study of an art which is no longer called "primitive art." An important premise of such a symmetrical study is to accept that phenomena we observe in the Western world can principally occur in the non- Western world too, and vice versa, to accept something we know from the non- Western world as being principally possible in the Western world too. New Approaches to the Anthropological Study of Images Most recently quite a few anthropologists have adopted the first approach and explored phenome- na we know from the Western world in non- West- ern contexts. Behrend (1990), Behrend and Wendl (1998), and Meyer (1998), to refer only to some empirical research done by German anthropolo- gists during the 1990s, have studied "processes of globalization," for example the appropriation, integration, and transformation of so-called "new" visual media (photography, film, and video) in West and East African cultures - media which are associated with ideas of "modernity." For a long time both art historians and anthropologists were not prepared to acknowledge the contempo- raneousness and the modernity of the "Other" - Fabian (1983) has called our attention to these mechanisms of "othering." Therefore, as Wendl (1998: 21) has noted, they had difficulties appre- ciating new images of the "Other" produced by "modern" media. The reverse perspective was adopted by the South African art historian Freedberg (1991) who assumed that attitudes towards images known from the non- Western world would also occur in the Occident. Freedberg explored the attributes, abil- ities, and efficacies - in short: the power - as- cribed to images in various Western contexts since antiquity. For instance he studied the functions and uses of images of gods, saints, and votive pictures, the myth of the absence of images in great monotheistic religions which from the theological point of view give preference to the Divine Word and the Holy Scriptures over religious images. Freedberg not only analyzed the great iconoclastic movements in European history but also the de- struction of paintings and sculptures in contem- porary museums of art. Like the German anthro- pologist Kramer (1990:45), who understood the perception of images as the interaction between the object and the perceiver,4 Freedberg not only took an interest in what spectators do in consequence of their relationship to images but also in the kind of efficacy and vitality they ascribed to the images themselves, Inspite of modern "ideologies of enlighten- ment" as scientism, rationalism, or materialism Freedberg was able to demonstrate that in the Occidental history of images evidences of the power of images and the fear of the power of images were and still are abundant. The same is true for non-European histories of images in which the myth of the disenchantment of the world has not played any role. In the following I shall focus on only a few examples from very different contexts, illustrating the power of images. Undoubtedly, readers will be able to add more examples from their own regional studies, research experiences, or reading. It goes without saying that images have very specific meanings in the cultures they are produced in and that conse- quently perceivers are motivated by them to very specific actions. This has been shown by many detailed and subtle anthropological studies of the last decades concerning the art of non-European societies.5 My main concern at present, however, is to describe conceptions and actions which seem to transcend historical, geographical, social, and cultural boundaries. Therefore, I shall outline the particular contexts in which the beliefs in the power of images are imbedded only in so far as this is necessary for an understanding of the attitudes and efficacies attributed to specific images. The Power of Images in Religious Contexts The Abelam, a group of tropical gardeners in the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea, are well- known as superb image makers. We know them 3 See, for example, Banks 1997; Ericson 1988; Sullivan 1995. 4 In this context see also Keifenheim 1998. 5 For a recent and informative overview of anthropological studies in the arts of non-European societies see for example Van Damme (1996). Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="4">1 92 Sylvia M. Schomburg-Scherff mainly from the studies of the British anthropo- logist Anthony Forge6 who worked among them in the 1960s, and from the works of the Swiss anthropologist Brigitta Hauser-Schäublin7 who studied the Abelam art almost 20 years later. Abelam images - plaited masks, anthropomor- phic wooden sculptures, and large paintings - are produced by men and can be classified as sacred images. They are partly overt, partly covert - accessible only to initiated men - representations of gods and spirits: representations of the divine creator, of deified clan ancestors, of spirits of the dead, spirits of the sacred yams, and of cosmológica! forces. During the dramatically staged religious cele- brations the sacred images of the Abelam come alive. Masked dancers embody the spirits of the dead, sacred yams, and clan ancestors. Even the large wooden ancestral figures and sculptures of yam spirits which are kept hidden in the dark interior of the men's house are animated. Under the instructions of a renowned artist initiated men wash and renovate the statues, remove residues of the old colour, and paint them with fresh sacred colours. Thus made to function and vested with new energy the vitalized images are entertained and fed to obtain their benevolence, their help in the growth of the young yam plants and to ensure a rich harvest. Before being planted the seedlings are rubbed on the sacred statues in order that the powers of the ancestors and the yam spirits may enter the yam tubers and make them grow large. During the later phases of the yam cultivation the newly painted and vitalized sculptures are carried from the cult house to the huts at the edge of the gardens in order to enable the ancestors whom they embody to watch and aid the growing and ripening of yams in close proximity. At the yam harvest festival the largest tubers are also vitalized. They are adorned with freshly painted facial masks, dec- orated with symbols of dignity reserved for the so- cially most influential "big men," and given names of celebrated ancestors. These big yam tubers, which now look like ancestors returned from the dead on a visit to their descendants, are displayed in front of the cult house. The harvest festival culminates with the dance of the magnificently adorned, masked, and painted yam cultivators, who because of their body decoration also look like animated ancestral statues. In this way the powers of the ancestors are not only represented but also presented. They become visible, tangible and can be experienced. Yet, among the Abelam as among other groups the visible cannot only make things or conceptions visible. The visible - to put it paradoxically - can also keep the invisible hidden. As Nooter (1993) has noted it "conceals and reveals" at the same time according to the knowledge the perceivers have of understanding cosmological allusions concealed and contained in the visible forms. In a summarizing overview the late German anthropologist Otto Zerries (1973/74) has depicted the very common conception among Indian groups in South America that anthropomorphic wooden figures are living beings. If in the planters' life and worldview of the Abelam yams play a powerful and central role, among South American Indian groups it is the tree that is a dominant symbol. Trees, for example huge palm trees, are considered to be living beings who in mythic times were able to move about and who can become mobile again any time they want to. They tower to the sky, are connecting links to the other world, and mediators dealing with the supernatural beings living there. Trees live eternally, embody invisible forces, and carry fruit important for nourishment. They are related to human beings because in times of old a divine creator or ancestor had carved anthropomorphic wooden figures which then came alive and became the first humans. The conception that human figures carved from wood are living beings is expressed in the production and worship of anthropomorphic wooden figures - be they in the shape of simple posts, wooden logs decorated either with ornaments or clothes, rude wooden figures, or finely carved sculptures. The Brasilian Xingu Indians for instance cel- ebrate a festival (kuarup) in honour and remem- brance of deceased family members. On this oc- casion the men animate and vitalize wooden logs by painting and decorating them with gender spe- cific ornaments. These kuarup posts represent the deceased as Zerries (1973/74: 376) has elaborated. Some groups not only honour recently deceased family members by erecting an image but also remote ancestors still known by name. During the festival these ancestors return to their descendants from the dead to participate in the form of the posts, to welcome the newly deceased and to conduct them safely to their village in the upper world. Besides, they want to be present at the weddings which take place simultaneously with the festival, kuarup time is marriage time. The presence of the ancestors in the images ensures as is commonly believed not only the safe voyage 6 Forge 1962, 1967, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974. 7 Hauser-Schäublin 1979, 1980, 1982, 1983. Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="5">The Power of Images 193 of the deceased to the realm of the dead but also the continuation and growth of the group (Zerries 1973/74: 376). Conceptions that powers are inherent in images, that images have abilities and efficacies, that they possess a soul and are alive, or that they can be animated and made to function are to be found in many parts of the world. The power of images seems not to be dependent on their form - that is whether the images are rudely or elaborately, figuratively or geometrically shaped. The Austra- lian anthropologist Howard Morphy (1991, 1992) describes the geometrical patterns painted by men of the Yolngu who live in Northeastern Arnhem Land on the coast of North Australia. These patterns are believed to be the most sacred and powerful paintings within a gérontocratie system of secret knowledge. In contrast to the overt figu- rative representations of clan ancestors the power of geometrical patterns consists in their ambiguity and ability to produce multiple relationships to the dreamtime, the ancestors, different forms of landscapes, and mythical events which took place there. In the course of his life a man obtains increasing access to the secret knowledge of his clan and continually learns to interpret geometrical patterns in multiple ways. During the last phase of creating the pattern is animated or empowered by light cross-hatching which gives it an intensive brilliancy. This brilliancy is regarded not only as beautiful but also as resembling the ancestral past. It emanates from the ancestral beings, gives the image the power of the ancestors, and makes it the embodiment of the ancestors, themselves. Geometrical patterns represent the ancestors and at the same time are part of the ancestral power itself.8 The West African Nupe offer another example for the non-anthropomorphic, geometrical shaping of religious images. In the 1930s, when the British anthropologist Siegfried F. Nadel carried out his field research in Central Nigeria, the Nupe had masks called ndakó gboyá which were unlike any other masks used in the cults of Nigerian ethnic groups. The name ndakó gboyá was "employed for the ritual performance as such, for the masks appearing in it, and for the 'spirit' the masks were thought to represent." According to Nadel the masks bore "no similarity to human or animal features; each mask [consisted] of a long tube made of white cotton cloth, just wide enough for a man to stand inside, which [was] suspended from a wheel-shaped bamboo frame fixed to the top of a tall pole, about twelve feet in length. The man representing the spirit [stood] inside the cloth tube which [came] down to the ground, holding the pole in his hands" (1954: 190). When the dancer inside the cylindrically shaped mask moved about with varying speed, occasionally jumping and run- ning, lifting and lowering the pole, making the cloth tube swing and sway, the mask's unearthly, eerie appearance had a frightening effect on the spectators as Nadel has reported (1954: 189-206). The name of the mask meant "Grandfather" or "Ancestor Gboyá" but had no ancestral conno- tation, indicating merely a show of respect. The dancing mask which was the representation and embodiment of a mystical force appeared during the main initiation ritual of the Nupe, during the vigil in the bush, to frighten novices, warn the youths to obey their elders, and whip offenders. It reappeared later, during the public phase of the ceremony, to frighten all women, to discourage would-be witches, and to weaken, by its very pres- ence, the evil powers of witchcraft. According to Nadel (1954: 191), once the performer was inside the mask, he was inseparable from the thing he "represented." He was the ndakó gboyá, the people insisted. Nadel tested this statement and, during a ceremony, offered food and drink to the "man in the mask," suggesting that he must be in need of refreshment after his exhausting performance. But his offer was ridiculed and he was told that "spirits do not eat." In many cultures masks are literally brought to life by a human dancer who carries, moves, and thereby animates the mask. Is, therefore, the spirit only present through the mediation of a living performer? It does not seem to be that simple. An image, the mask ndakó gboyá of the Nupe for instance or the already mentioned paintings and statues of the Abelam, Xingu, or Yolngu, often gets its abilities and efficacies not until it has received sacrifices, been consecrated and vitalized in a particular way. At least, in many cases the powerful potential inherent in images is only then activated or reinforced. In order that a dancing mask becomes the mystic force it represents, in order that it is no longer merely a material object, 8 Another ethnographic example for the power of geomet- rical representations is to be found, for instance, among Trobriand islanders. As Gell (1992) has pointed out, the spirally carved and painted planks at the bow of kula trade canoes are said to bewitch and confuse trade partners, to make them loose their willpower, their reason, and their self-control so that they trade more valuable shells and necklaces than they would offer if they could keep their wits about them. Keifenheim (1998) has studied geometrical ornaments among the Kashinawa in Eastern Peru which are said to have equally strong suggestive powers. Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="6">1 94 Sylvia M. Schomburg-Scherff but the thing itself which it signifies, it has to have not only a particular form or a particular appear- ance but also has to be prepared and manipulated in a special way. Only then can it become the residence of a spirit or a force, become the thing it represents. As soon as the image is consecrated it must be treated with respect and awe. Insulting the image is equivalent to insulting the force it represents. The examples mentioned so far make plain that attributes, abilities, and efficacies of images are activated, reinforced, or put to function by acts of consecration. Images are set in particular contexts, formed, worked on, washed, anointed, wreathed, painted, made the centre of special rites and sacrifices to animate them and to rouse their complete forces. As we are informed by Freedberg (1991: 82 ff.), in Ancient Egypt and Babylonia the transition of the status from an image made by the human hand to a sacred image of god was performed with the aid of a whole set of rites identifying the image with the deity and filling it with the life of this deity. When, for instance, a sculptor had finished his work on a statue, the working ground was cleaned in a first step. Then the sculpture was washed, anointed, perfumed, incensed, offered sacrifices, and sprinkled with holy water. Its mouth was ritually opened, and the statue was given food and drink. In a next step the image was dressed in white cloth and decorated with the insignia of power. Finally, the eyes of the image were opened, for example, by painting them with colours. Now the statue was alive because the eyes were that part of the image which most strongly signified life. It was erected in a consecrated place and worshipped as the visible body of the deity. During all of these ritual phases the image was addressed as god himself. The rites aimed at transforming dead matter to life, inducing the deity to take residence in the image and to fill it with life and powers. Another indication of the power of images is that in many cultures people ascribe sacred, almost divine attributes to the producers or creators of images. Artists/artisans are thus believed to have abilities other members of the society do not have and which cannot be acquired by mere learning. The prerequisites for artistic activity are often a spiritual vocation, particular secret knowledge, and working in seclusion. In many societies it is incumbent upon artists to perform special rites, make sacrifices, and follow certain taboos. Artistic creation is therefore seen as the result of close contact with transcendental powers. For example, Abelam "artists-priests" are considered to be spe- cial mediators dealing with the the spirit world. They have the ability to make invisible forces visible in the images they create and to ensure the continuous presence of the dead and absent ancestors among the living. With the aid of the ritual painting of the wooden statues with sacred colours they are able to endow them, again and again, with renewed powers and animate them. Among the Gola in West African Liberia artists are often charismatic, divinely inspired, and ec- centric personalities as Warren d'Azevedo (1973) has pointed out. As soon as the masks they have carved have left the workshop, been consecrated, and offered sacrifices, they, as many other African sculptures and masks,9 are no longer thought to be images created by the human hand but living embodiments of spiritual forces. To give anoth- er very recent example from Africa, in Ghana, as Meyer (1998) reports, local filmmakers who take up religious themes, depicting for instance occult forces threatening young women and their ultimately successful struggle to get away from these powers of darkness, understand and present themselves as visionaries. In interviews Meyer learned "that many filmmakers first 'saw' the film they eventually set out to make in a dream and they regarded this experience as a divine gift and felt challenged to visualize these dream images" (1998: 3). Popular Ghanaian filmmakers and their public think of these visions as being similar to those provided by religious prophets and preach- ers. From collections and translations of ancient Greek legends - see for example Schwab (1958: 68 f.) - we know the legend of the famous Dae- dalus, the most ingenious craftsman of his time, inventor, architect, and sculptor at once. People said of his statues that they were alive and able to see and regarded them as animated beings. Daedalus was the first to sculpture his statues with open eyes, with outstretched arms and with the feet stepping forward whereas the eyes of the sculptures of former sculptors were closed and their arms hung down limply because they were attached to the sides of the body. Daeda- lus was supposed to be a sorcerer who created statues of stone which appeared to be living be- ings and had to be fixed lest they ran away as 9 See, for instance, the sculptures of the Yoruba in Ni- geria (Lawal 1974:245), the Zande in Zaire (Burssens 1962: 125), the Fang in Gabun (Fernandez 1971:362), or the masks of the Mende (Hommel 1974: Introduction), the Okpella (Borgatti 1982: 28, 34), or the Nupe (Nadel 1954: 190 f.). Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="7">The Power of Images 195 Freedberg has pointed out (1991:36, 76). The ability to capture the likeness of a person in an image or, to put it in Gell' s words (1992:51), to bring about a mysterious "transubstantiation" of the materials used into something different is transculturally thought to be some kind of "mag- ical" power, as it were, of the artist, transcending the ability of ordinary human beings. Kris and Kurz (1980) have devoted a whole book to this theme. The Power of Images in the Context of Magic Images were and are still used the world over to shame and punish, to cause harm to or to heal, to kill or to lead astray the people represented therein. Most examples for public varieties of this image magic come from Europe between the 14th to the 17th century when it was a common practice of jurisdiction and punishment through- out Europe to sentence and publicly punish the absent miscreant by punishing his representation by public disfigurement, mutilation, or hanging as we are informed, for instance, by Freedberg (1991: 246-260). To be able to punish absent mis- creants so-called "images of infamy (the German Schandbilder is a better term) were made. They represented the delinquent and his crime very accurately so that the wrongdoer was definitely recognizable and present in the image. In addition, an inscription naming the condemned was placed on the image to avoid any confusion. Thereafter, the whole execution machinery came to bear on these images of infamy. Both two- and three- dimensional images were publicly and formally not only insulted and shamed but also pilloried, mutilated, burnt, quartered, stoned, even hanged, and decapitated. "One could hardly overempha- size the shame of this form of punishment. . . . People in positions of power strained to have the images of relatives or political allies removed; and men condemned in this way sometimes preferred to submit to what to us would appear severer punishment - in at least one case, that of hang- ing - than to have their names and reputation so visibly and publicly besmirched" (Freedberg 1991:251). Other, more individual forms of image magic for negatively or positively influencing the repre- sented person are known from all over the world and since antiquity. Images of animals, persons, spirits, or deities were made from most different materials. These representations were beaten, bur- ied, pierced, powdered, mutilated, or destroyed in order to punish, injure, or kill the represented. Or conversely, the image was cared for, nursed, fed, perfumed, or worshipped in other ways in order to make sure of the love, recognition, or benevolence of the represented. In these forms of image magic - just as with the images of infamy- it was absolutely essential that the identity of represen- tation and represented was assured either by using special substances, by naming the represented or by resemblance, lest confusion with another person should be possible. In many different cultures anthropologists have encountered the belief that if one has the represen- tation of a person in one's possession one has pow- er over the represented himself. Consequently, fear of being portrayed and resistance to portraits were widespread, as Gell has pointed out (1992: 51). In this context photographs are of particular impor- tance. Barbara Keifenheim (1987) reports, that the Peruvian Kashinawa traced the death of many of their relatives back to the taking of pictures and shooting of films by a German anthropologist who visited them in the 1950s. In the viewfinder of his camera the Kashinawa had seen diminutive images of themselves. They were convinced that the anthropologist had robbed the images of their relatives and had thereby caused their death. In the 19th century among Indians of the North American Plains the term "shadow catcher" was widely used to signify a photographer. It refers to the idea that a photo catches the shadow, the soul, a part of the essence of the represented person and gives the photographer power over the person whose picture he has taken, as Lomosits (1999: 87) has pointed out in an overview on the Lakota and early photography. In many African societies the realistic representation of a person was avoided until most recent times, as the Af- ricanists Kramer (1987) and Behrend (1990: 569) have noted, because the magic of likeness gave the person who created the image power over the represented. When photography was introduced to Africa during the last century "local beliefs about stealing souls and shadows made for considerable resis- tance to photographers. Picture taking was feared because it was thought to make people weak or their blood thin. In many African languages, the word for 'negative' is the same as for ghost or dead spirit, and cameras were often literally referred to as 'shadow-catching machines'" as Behrend and Wendl (1997: 411) write in an essay on social and cultural aspects of African photography. However, the initial fear seems to have abated quickly. Today photographs and films belong to the canon of Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="8">1 96 Sylvia M. Schomburg-Scherff African pictorial traditions. Photographs have been integrated into ancestor worship. In the context of migration they serve as substitutes for absent persons. They are used for healing and harming. And in love magic they are widely "worked on" to bring back a beloved (411). Photographic and cinematographic images have become integrated components of local imagery worlds. Today, African photographers are image magi- cians of a different kind (cf. Behrend and Wendl 1997, 1998). Their pictures serve not only the purpose of ensuring the presence of the absent, of keeping the dead under the living, they also serve the purpose of preserving memories of happy times and of successful and beautiful persons - even creating them. The studios of these image magi- cians are places of staging. They resemble a stage with props, ritualized operations and sceneries. Photographic models strip off their everyday self, enter an imaginary pictorial space, and, with all the necessary attributes, they are changed into chiefs and kings. Or customers may be photographed in front of fantastic, more or less realistically painted backdrops showing landscapes or urban scenes, status symbols of the middle-classes or bourgeois living room interiors filled with the icons of advertizing and seductive objects of desire as TV, refrigerator, etc. By retouching black and white photographs African photographers are able to beautify and make their customers look younger. With the aid of photomontage they improve the social standing of their models. For example, in the case of an ordinary migrant worker they mount his passport photograph on the body of the photograph of an elegantly dressed man. Practicing magic with photographic images is not at all unfamiliar to us. We know it especially from political propaganda, consumer advertizing, television, and photographic report. An exhibition captioned "Images that lie" (cf. Buchsteiner 1998) shown at the "Haus der Geschichte" in Bonn, Germany, documented both the power of photo- graphs to create realities as well as the fear of their suggestive powers. One of the most famous exhibits was the photo of a soldier of the Red Army, who in May 1945 hoisted the Soviet flag on the destroyed Reichstag building. Berlin had already capitulated, the red flag flapped long since in the wind when a photographer of the news agency TASS restaged the scene. However, he had to change the staged picture once more before So- viet authorities released it because on the original photo one of the soldiers wore two wristwatches - these traces of plundering were not allowed to be shown. Tentative Explanatory Approaches How can one tentatively explain the seductive, suggestive, magical power of images anthropo- logically, from the point of view of image pro- ducers and perceivers? One of several possible explanatory approaches is offered by widespread conceptions of power summarized by the Ger- man anthropologist Müller (1987: esp. 170-198). As Müller points out, assumptions that some kind of power penetrates the whole of nature underlie all cosmological systems. This force is ultimately traced back to a divine creator or creating deities. But it is not evenly distributed - neither in the human body nor in society, nature, or the cosmos. In the human body power is concentrated, for instance, in the eyes and in the look, in soci- ety in special persons like the artist, in nature it is to be found in special plants like essential crops or in such with special attributes like the tree. Every phenomenon perceived as being ex- traordinary, strange, or bizarre is believed to be vested with special powers. Images, therefore, are cross-culturally thought to have power because they are, for instance, of a special origin: some images of gods or saints are supposed to have fallen down from the sky; some ancestral figures are supposed to have come from the realms of the dead. In addition, the efficacy of images is partially caused by the special substances they are made of, for example, particular stones, woods, or colours. Moreover, images have special powers because they are of a striking shape or form, of a very special appearance, because they are the result of good craftsmanship or artistic formation. In this respect, however, images do not differ from other striking objects, be they natural or made by human hand. Suhrbier (1998), rightly, speaks of "the power of objects." But what is it that constitutes the particular power of images? Which role does the figuration play in making objects effective? As the examples given illustrate the belief in the efficacy of images is based on the idea that images participate in the power and life of the being they represent and on the perception that the visually represented is present. One way of anthropologically explaining these ideas apparently transcending boundaries of time and space offer widespread conceptions of souls. According to these conceptions compiled for instance in Müller (1983) human beings possess two different kinds of souls: a vital soul bound to the body in which the vital force manifests itself and a free soul which is a manifestation of spiritual powers. This free soul can, for instance, Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="9">The Power of Images 197 leave the body during sleep and travel around. If a human being dies, his vital soul dissolves together with his body. The free soul, however, abandons the dead body and returns to the other world from where it has come. It is also often termed "image" or "shadow soul" indicating that the image of a person perceived in a mirror, in the surface reflection of water or as a shadow is interpreted as a materialization of the free soul, as a double or alter ego. The West African Songhai term the image or shadow soul bia (cf. Rouch 1960, 1982), the East African Tugen tondoi (cf. Behrend 1990), the Peruvian Kashinawa "spirit of visions" (cf. Keifenheim 1987). If the image soul on its travels is stolen by a sorcerer, the person will die unless a magician or shaman is able to get it back. According to these beliefs, anthropologists like Rouch, Behrend, or Keifenheim, who made photographs and moving pictures, stole the images or shadow souls of the people they filmed in a way comparable to what sorcerers were believed to do. They could minimize their threatening behaviour only by bringing - like a shaman would do - the stolen images in the form of photos and movies back to the people they took them from. In this view visual representations are physical materiali- zations of the free soul as von Kittlitz (1994: 205) has pointed out. Another anthropological approach to the un- derstanding of the relationship between the im- age and the original is suggested by widespread conceptions postulating something like the "mag- ic" of similarity. According to these conceptions, the relationship between similar things or simi- lar phenomena is perceived as a kind of affini- ty, even consanguinity, meaning that there exists an intimate interaction between similar phenome- na as Müller (1987:207) has shown. The Scot- tish anthropologist and theorist of magic, James George Frazer (1854-1941), summarized these ideas a hundred years ago in his well-known "law of resemblance" (Frazer 1977: 15) without con- cealing that he, one of the main representatives of anthropological evolutionism of his time, regarded these ideas as misconceptions. He illustrated his "law" by examples of sympathetic magic like image magic. According to Frazer, the effect of image magic was based on the belief in the exis- tence of a mysterious tie of sympathy between the image and prototype, which functioned magically from a distance. However, the conceptions of re- semblance underlying the practices of image magic and the worship of cult images in the examples mentioned above suggest a more concretely con- ceived and immediately perceived relationship. All procedures of producing images and acting upon them testify to the laborious effort to ensure the identity of the representation and represented in order that the image may come to life and function properly. All manipulations of the finished image suggest that this identity is perceived. The Nupe said of the mask gboyá that it was the spirit itself, Abelam of their ancestral figures that they were the grandfathers. The deity is present in the image, the victim in the effigy. On this basis images are perceived to unfold their powers in terms of their presence (magical presence one might perhaps say), i.e., on account of the identity of the represented with that which represents it. Or, in the words of the art historian Freedberg, who thinks that the notion of magic is much too associated with ideas of "primitive" behavior to be used in a satisfactory and reasonably unbiased way for signifying the identity between image and god or human, cognition fuses the prototype and image and invests the latter with the qualities of the former (1991: 281). In his book "Wahrheit und Methode," first published in 1960 (English translation: "Truth and Method," 1975) the German philosopher Hans Georg Gadamer has developed an interpretation of images surprisingly resembling the theories men- tioned here. According to Gadamer' s "ontology of the picture," "a picture is not a copy of a copied being, but is in ontological communion with what is copied" (1975: 126). And Gadamer claims that image magic "depends on the iden- tity and non-differentiation of picture and what is pictured" (1975: 123). This non-differentiation remains for him an essential feature of all expe- rience of pictures (123). The French semiologist Roland Barthes, too, in his lucid essay on photog- raphy (1989), speaks of the non-distinction of the photograph and its referent, the thing or person it represents (1989: 13). In the photo he loved of his deceased mother he always saw only the referent, the desired object, the beloved person, as he noted (1989: 15). The return and presence of the dead he thought smacks of the uncanny in photography (1989: 17). Even semiotics with its terminological distinctions - signifier, signified, and referent - claims that images are not just signs, signifying nothing more than themselves, but visual represen- tations of something. As visual signs they have a material form (the signifier) and a spiritual content (the signified). As signs they denote something different than themselves, namely a referent in a perceived or imagined world. One could not speak more clearly of the power of images than to make these distinctions. Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="10">198 Sylvia M. Schomburg-Scherff But is not every discourse on the power of images metaphorical? When we say that a thing, a person, or a spirit represented in a picture is actually present, that for example a deity, the Vir- gin Mary, or an ancestor is alive in the image, do we then think and speak only metaphorically? Or metonymically? In that case, the examples given are not only an evidence of the constructive power of metaphorical and metonymical thinking but also of the constructive power of human perception and cognition to fuse the image with reality.
