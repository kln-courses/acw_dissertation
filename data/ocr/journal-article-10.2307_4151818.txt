Decoding Shaywitz: The modular brain and its discontents GEORGE G. HRUBY Utah State University, Logan, USA GEORGE W. HYND Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA or several years, Sally Shaywitz, the well-known dyslexia researcher, Yale neurosci- entist, medical doctor, and member of the National Reading Panel, has proven adept at getting her research-related beliefs about the effective remediation of read- ing difficulties into the hands of policymakers and the general public (e.g., Fillon, 2000; Gorman, 2003; Lyon, Shaywitz, Shaywitz, &amp; Chhabra, 2005; Shaywitz &amp; Shaywitz, 2004a, 2004b). With Overcoming Dyslexia: A New and Complete Science- Based Program for Reading Problems at Any Level, Shaywitz (2003/2005) provides an extended description of her perspective for such an audience. By her own ac- count, as indicated in the subtitle, she has authored a book that would not only comprehensively demystify dyslexia by the light of scientific research but also re- view methods for conquering it. Because it is not a scholarly work, regular invoca- tions of science aside, the text can prove frustrating for scholarly readers and reviewers. In our estimation, it is a work more for parents distraught over their poorly reading offspring. In reviewing books written for a general audience, a certain amount of leeway must be allowed of an author on behalf of brevity, clarity, simplicity, and vivacity. Abbreviation of detail regarding matters of interest comprehensible only to specialists 544</page><page sequence="2">Essay Book Review 545 is the mark of a competent and thoughtful writer of books for the general reader. However, when clarity is lost to brevity, or coherence to vivacity, reviewers should make no allowances for such unnecessary abridgment and instead argue on behalf of a complete and accurate report. It is our impression that Shaywitz has not provided a complete account of the scientific efforts behind constructing a serviceable understand- ing of dyslexia in this book. As a result, Overcoming Dyslexia could give the general reader an erroneous impression about the current state of both scientific reading research and research in the neurosciences. The style of Shaywitz's prose at times requires great forbearance, and the occasionally disjointed arrangement of the arguments can be exasperating, making a clear and precise grasp of her reasoning dif- ficult. There are chapters that read quite well, but others that are inscrutable the closer you attend to them, while still others pop along in a bullet outline format. In truth, it may be hard to justify reviewing a popular work like this in the pages of a scholarly journal such as Reading Research Quarterly. But Overcoming Dyslexia does provoke serious medita- tions on the nature of psychobiological research and its relationship to the study of literacy, learning, and human development. In this review, we will first recap our mixed re- sponse to the book (our focus will be on the book only, not on Shaywitz's research oeuvre, which has contributed substantively to the literature, or her possible ideological commitments); second, we will consider larger issues in cognitive neuroscience that caution against too-quick assertions of science-based knowledge about reading process and intervention on its basis; and, finally, we will nonetheless argue for the importance of psychobiological, neuroscien- tific, and bioecological research on reading, learning, and student development. We believe that such a res- cue operation is warranted, particularly given con- ceptual breakthroughs in the interdisciplinary life sciences, and we will suggest that more than a merely cognitive lens (Bruer, 2003, in press) ought to be brought to bear in bridging between education and the socionatural sciences. Rather, we will suggest that current work on system-based developmental models (Fischer, Bernstein, &amp; Immordino-Yang, 2006; Karmiloff-Smith, 1992; Siegler, 2005) with its ready acknowledgment of embedded, compounding, and transactional factors in the emergence and operation of complex systems would better account for the in- terpersonal and socioemotional dynamics of reading development. We believe this approach could also be more intuitively appealing to teachers than the cur- rent mind-as-wet-computer metaphor underlying Shaywitz's interpretation of her brain-imaging data and thus might prove a more useful conceptual com- pass for a bioecological account of reading develop- ment and its variability. When style meets structure The gist of Overcoming Dyslexia is that dyslexia is a congenital neurological impairment anchored in phonological processing capability but far more com- mon than reading specialists and neuroscientists have hitherto determined. (Shaywitz's estimates of the pro- portion of students with dyslexia ranges from 20% to 30%). The author and her fellow researchers at Yale claim to have pinpointed the primary locus of this disability (underdevelopment of the occipito- temporal cortex where word form identification is processed). And she has assembled (or pulled from the National Reading Panel report [National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD], 2000]) a seemingly massive battery of re- search to promote effective dyslexia intervention (she chiefly recommends explicit phonological awareness and synthetic phonics training) and to promote read- ing instruction (she chiefly recommends the same). The author divides her 23 chapters into four sections: (a) The Nature of Reading and Dyslexia, (b) Diagnosing Dyslexia, (c) Helping Your Child Become a Reader, and (d) Overcoming Dyslexia: Turning Struggling Readers Into Proficient Readers. There is also an epilogue providing several testimonial- like biographical sketches of famous dyslexics (writ- ers, surgeons, businesspeople, and so on), endnotes keyed to pages (but not, unfortunately, keyed in the actual text, making reference hunting burdensome and too often leaving the source checker empty- handed), a rather encyclopedic acknowledgments section, and an index. This last possibly appears lim- ited in scope but is probably fairly complete. There is no bibliography. The education community will be relieved to learn in this book that dyslexia has little to do with incompetent teachers or dysfunctional schools, al- though uninformed educators, Shaywitz claims, of- ten fail to provide the appropriate kind of phonics instruction needed to address the development of reading problems in students, often misdiagnose and mishandle cases of dyslexia, and are generally unable to provide the intensive one-on-one interventions re- quired for amelioration of reading disorders. Parents will also be relieved to read that dyslexia is not due to their own inattentiveness or the nature of the home environment, though it may be due to their</page><page sequence="3">546 Readinig Research Quarterly OCTOBER/NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2006 41/4 genes. Happily, according to the author, dyslexia is addressable with research-based methods that can comfort and enable poor readers sufficiently to allow them a successful life, and, perhaps more important for the target audience of this book, to stop embar- rassing and destroying the self-esteem of their par- ents (as described in a colorful vignette, pp. 8-9). Shaywitz has an unfortunate tendency to claim certain knowledge about issues for which there is, in fact, debate by scholars and other reasonable stake- holders. She also fails to review the decades of debate in reading research about such things as the nature of the reading process, optimal ways of developing fa- cility with decoding, the nature of comprehension, the institutional construction of labels such as dyslex- ic, and so on. She further fails to indicate alternative interpretations of the neuroscience research on read- ing and reading difficulties, and too often fails to support her assertions with either adequate or appro- priate research citations in the endnotes, or to pro- vide sufficient rational explanation for her claims. A general reader with no background in the fundamen- tals of research or its limitations could easily get the impression that reference to a single study, or even merely to the say-so of a government official, is suffi- cient scientific evidence for making sweeping claims about what "we now know." To be fair, there are abundant research refer- ences and ancillary information sources tucked all over this book, like stray papers in a professor's over- crowded office. Shaywitz's references to research are either dashed across the page, crammed into the cracks and crevices of the endnotes, or ellipsed in offhand attributions without notes. At times they are intimated in epigrammatic explanations so abbrevi- ated even a knowledgeable reader would have diffi- culty reconstructing the original study. Surely, nonspecialists may be impressed, and because they are not likely to make sense of the research in any event, what difference does it make how the evi- dence is provided? But for the knowledgeable reader, the chaos is irritating and can raise concerns about rhetorical intent. Another stylistic tic is Shaywitz's tendency to lapse into dramatic language. The personal vignettes are fraught with this, and it will not be to everyone's taste. But even if one allows for occasional outbursts of pathos, the passion of her convictions too often seeps into what should be objectifiable claims. For example, she suggests, "incredible as it may seem to- day, we can actually see someone's brain at work as she reads" (p. 59). This is a terrific sound-bite, but it oversimplifies how functional brain images are ob- tained and what they may represent, as we will dis- cuss subsequently in this essay. As an example of Shaywitz's tendency to overassertion, consider the following passage. In re- viewing her understanding of dyslexia on the basis of cognitive neuroscience research, Shaywitz observes that "underactivation in the back of the brain... [is] a neural signature for the phonological difficulties char- acterizing dyslexia" (p. 82). The endnote for this claim of a universal signature from "a world wide communi- ty of scientists" (p. 373) is indeed one of the longest in the book, but it consists of only eight studies, none described. Granted, this is presumably only a sam- pling, but there are other potential neurological signa- tures in "the back of the brain" that could be indicated by numerous studies, as well as other typical irregular- ities elsewhere in the brains of dyslexics. For example, not only does Shaywitz fail to discuss the contributions of Samuel Orton (1928) and other pioneers in neuroscience, but also she makes no reference to the copious research inspired by his work. Such research indicates that individuals suffering severe reading disabilities frequently also show deficiencies in cerebral dominance for lan- guage, perceptual deficits, deficits in cross-modal in- tegration, problems in intersensory integration, deficits in temporal order recall, and deficits in atten- tion and associated automatized processes (Hynd, Hooper, &amp; Takahashi, 1998). Another paragraph proceeds as follows, These findings are helping us understand the roots of dyslex- ia. For example, we observed the disruption in young chil- dren that indicated that the wiring glitch is present from the start of reading and does not represent the end result of years of poor reading. The identical posterior disruption is observed in children and in adults-neurological proof that reading problems don't go away. They are persistent, and now we know why. (p. 82) The research cited in the endnotes for this chapter (there are no endnotes to substantiate any of the statements in this paragraph) does not necessarily indicate an inherent, let alone permanent, "wiring glitch" or "disruption" in dyslexics' brains. The stud- ies cited do indicate that when poor readers struggle with text they do not activate or develop the left pos- terior areas of the brain to the same degree as good readers. But the possible developmental and physio- logical reasons for this are quite numerous and need not necessarily be due to an inherent "wiring glitch." This is interesting information to have, as it coin- cides with what we know about the behavior pat- terns of poor readers. But it adds little to our knowledge of reading disorders beyond what we</page><page sequence="4">Essay Book Review 547 already know based on behavioral observation. Shaywitz's interpretation of a limited selection of neuroscience research is provocative, but it is far from comprehensive, let alone definitive. As another example, consider Shaywitz's treat- ment of Matthew effects in reading. She raises the question of whether dyslexics outgrow their reading difficulties, and makes reference to the research that suggests they do not (Shaywitz, Holford, et al., 1995). She refers to this as the Matthew effect in reading, although the research she cites was actually a refutation of the concept as it was originally pro- posed by Stanovich (1986), whom she fails to cite. She defines Matthew effects in a brief sentence, quotes (and endnote cites) the appropriate biblical passage, but then, without segue, states, The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Our data showed that poor readers do not become relatively poorer readers. However, the data also provided strong evidence that children who were poor readers in the early school years remained poor readers. After school entry, children's reading achievement changes very little relative to their peers. This only confirms that struggling children need help with their reading difficulties very early on. (p. 34) Readers not already familiar with Matthew ef- fects could hardly be expected to make coherent sense of them from this foreshortened explanation of contradicting research. It is important to note that this repudiation of the Matthew effect model does not really demonstrate the optimal time when chil- dren benefit from help with their reading develop- ment, as Shaywitz asserts in the paragraph's last sentence. "Very early on" is not an especially precise finding, even if it were a finding, and the cited study is not about reading but about decoding (Shaywitz, Holford, et al., 1995). An example of Shaywitz's failure to compre- hensively review current neuroscience research on reading disorders is found in the omission of work documenting how children and adults who suffer se- vere reading disabilities often have difficulty with the rapid naming of colors, objects, and numbers (for a brief review see Hynd, Hooper, &amp; Takahashi, 1998). There is controversy in the literature about the sig- nificance of this and the relative uniqueness of deficits in phonological coding in dyslexia. The con- troversy involves research that has obscured the sepa- rable contribution of rapid automatized naming deficits, essentially incorporating it under the broad rubric of phonological processing, as is done in Overcoming Dyslexia. However, as Swanson, Trainin, Necoechea, and Hammill (2003) indicated in their comprehensive meta-analysis of the correlation literature on mea- sures of phonological awareness, rapid naming, and reading-related abilities, there is evidence to indicate that phonological awareness and rapid naming are unrelated to each other, although each independent- ly correlates (moderately) with real-word reading. As they suggested, other measures associated with word reading are often equally important (e.g., spelling ability). As Swanson et al. indicate in their review of the literature, isolated processes, such as phonological coding, do play a modest part in predicting real word reading and pseudo- word reading. However our study highlights additional processes as playing equally important roles in reading. It suggests that the importance of phonological awareness may have been overstated in the literature. (p. 432) Others, such as Bishop and Adams (1990), have also concluded that while the evidence suggests that phonological abilities are important, particularly in early reading acquisition, there are other more general verbal abilities that also exert major contribu- tions to the reading process. Therefore, one might conclude that the phonological model presented in this book represents a rather limited view that ig- nores significant contributions from other highly rel- evant studies. Even something as necessarily fundamental as a working definition of dyslexia is hard to get hold of in this book. Shaywitz teases us along through the opening chapter with "significant difficulty in learn- ing to read" (p. 3), "[a]s virulent as any virus that courses through tissues and organs" (p. 4), and Dyslexia is a complex problem that has its roots in the very basic brain systems that allow man [sic] to understand and express language. By discovering how a disruption in these fundamental neural circuits for coding language gives rise to a reading impairment, we have been able to understand how the tentacles of the disorder reach out from deep with- in the brain and affect not only how a person reads but sur- prisingly, a range of other important functions as well, including the ability to spell words, to retrieve words, to ar- ticulate words, and to remember certain facts. For the first time since dyslexia was initially described more than a cen- tury ago, scientists can see the "face of the beast," and we are now well on our way to taming and taking command of it. (p. 5) With this creepy image of dyslexia in mind, but no actual definition in hand, Shaywitz leads the read- er to estimations of the percentage of schoolchildren affected by reading disability, arriving, on the basis of her own research, at 20% to 30%. How readers are supposed to follow the logic of this calculation with- out a working definition of dyslexia is unclear, and</page><page sequence="5">548 Reading Research Quarterly OCTOBER/NOVEMBER/DE CEMBER 2006 41/4 whether Shaywitz assumes dyslexia, reading disorders, and reading difficulties are all the same thing is equal- ly unclear. In observing the contrasts between the 20% of students Shaywitz has identified as dyslexic with the percentage of students actually being treated for reading difficulties in the schools (approximately 3.5%), Shaywitz asserts, "This strongly suggest[s] un- diagnosed problems" (p. 30). Perhaps. Or it may sug- gest Shaywitz's figure is inflated. Without a precise definition, it is hard to say. Onward, Shaywitz proceeds to describe "clues" to dyslexia in the course of two chapters, one for the early-onset clues and one for the late. For good mea- sure she then restates these clues in a third chapter, all sans formal definition. Unfortunately, the early clues could easily lead to overdiagnosis. No statistical data are provided on the percentage of children demonstrating these behaviors who do not develop dyslexia (see Gersten &amp; Dimino, 2005, who cited studies of early overdiagnosis rates in reading disabil- ity prognoses on the basis of similar clues at 58% to 69%). Shaywitz's caveats are well warranted, and un- usually ample here, but contradict her assertions that these are dependable tools for parental diagnosis. By this point it is uncomfortably clear that Shaywitz is conflating dyslexia, as it has been tradi- tionally defined and constrained, with general read- ing difficulty. Her behavioral definition increases the percentage of children who can be labeled dyslexic by including virtually all low-performing readers, even those who have not had an adequate opportunity to learn to read, and so do not. By including all low- performing readers in her definition of dyslexic, Shaywitz guarantees that insistently and explicitly ap- plied (if garden-variety) reading methods, such as those Shaywitz recommends in later chapters of the book, will have astonishing results in many cases, and provide moderate gains for all dyslexics on average. A formal definition (the latest reformulation from the International Dyslexia Association as of 2002) finally appears in a footnote on page 132. Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurological in origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unex- pected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provi- sion of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehen- sion and reduced reading experience that can impede the growth of vocabulary and background knowledge. Parsing clinical definitions can get tricky, but we will here note two issues. By IDA's definition, many of the readers included in Shaywitz's sweeping diagnosis of 30% might not actually be dyslexic, for although all students who have not learned to read may indeed show similar signature neurological dis- parities in a brain imaging study, this is no indica- tion that all poor reading behavior is neurological in origin. Structural cause and developmental cause are two different things; one traces causative mecha- nisms, the other, ontogeny, which presumes contex- tual influence over time. Shaywitz seems to blur the two, or suggest that the latter does not occur. The difficulty here is with explicating organic brain func- tion on the basis of mechanistic models of mental process, an issue we shall elaborate subsequently in this review. The second issue regarding the IDA's defini- tion of dyslexia relates to its caveat that said reading difficulty should be "unexpected in relation to...the provision of effective classroom instruction" (p. 132). We find it difficult to understand why anyone would deem instructional methods effective in instances where they do not work. With this bi- categorizing definition, however, "effective instruc- tion" is instruction that is, ipsofacto, not effective for children who are dyslexic. In other words, according to this definition, effective instruction can account for cases where fallibility intrudes by appeal to the la- bel of dyslexia. Rather than fault the instruction, this definition faults the child. This changes the nature of the distributional cutoff for determining dyslexia from arbitrary to instrumentally delimited. Eventually Shaywitz reveals her own formal de- finition of developmental dyslexia: [T]he phonological weakness is primary, other components of the language system are intact, and the reading impair- ment is at the level of decoding the single word, initially ac- curately and later fluently. Intelligence is not affected and may be in the superior or gifted range. The disorder is pre- sent from birth and not acquired. (p. 140) She contrasts this with definitions of language- learning disability, acquired alexia, and hyperlexia. What is missing, unfortunately, is the category of underdeveloped reading ability. When structure meets substance Shaywitz's early research supported the position that dyslexia is simply the far tail of a normal distrib- ution of variance in reading ability. As a statistical observation of behavior, this is sound and underap- preciated. It is true, as she notes, that diagnostic la- bels too often come to be taken as descriptors of</page><page sequence="6">Essay Book Review 549 essential and immutable difference. On any measure one might care to gauge-reading or any other abili- ty-the normal distribution of variance in human populations, where by definition roughly half the population will be below average, will maintain. But there is a difference between measures of perfor- mance, which can be traced along a bell curve, with arbitrary cutoffs to indicate levels of symptomatic disability, and the causes of those differences in per- formance level. As it is indeed the case that at least some in- stances of dyslexia are due to differences in neurolog- ical development grounded in complex suites of genetic discrepancies, as Shaywitz maintains, then the biological causes of those differences in perfor- mance are indeed distinct. Shaywitz confirms as much when she emphasizes that the structural cause of dyslexia resides in areas of the brain that either are or are not functional-either one has the neurologi- cal circuitry, from this view, or one does not, and this hardly argues for a continuous causative model of reading ability/disability. It is probably fair to say that among many reading education researchers and practitioners there is a desire for an opposite view, one in which everyone has the same genetic and physiological propensity for developing the ability to read, and the failure of realizing this potential is only the result of discrepancies of experience and resultant developmental history. But the current wealth of re- search on brain physiology contradicts the latter ex- planation as a complete account. Some children do indeed appear to suffer heri- table dysfunction in reading and its subcomponent abilities such as phonological processing, and there are sound theoretical and research bases for assuming genetic and inherent neurological causes (see review in Rutter, 2006). But 20% to 30% is a singularly high estimation. The more frequent percentages cit- ed of the population afflicted with dyslexia are 5% to 17% (Moody, 2004; Snowling, 2005). Neurological dyslexia specifically related to phonological process- ing would be a fraction of that figure. Shaywitz's esti- mate comes from defining dyslexia symptomatically rather than causatively, and then assuming cause of a subgroup as cause for all. In any event, much more longitudinal research on gene-brain-child-context transactions will be required to make such assertions, at least with Shaywitz's exuberance. When substance meets reading As to addressing "reading problems at any lev- el" (the subtitle of the book), the methods Shaywitz describes at great length for teaching children to read and for treating dyslexia, including many of the pro- prietary programs she recommends, amount mostly to well-known, garden-variety reading instruction methods with an emphasis on phonemic awareness training and synthetic phonics methods that assume a bottom-up componential model of reading devel- opment. No review of the history of reading research or theory is provided to challenge this model, possi- bly giving the unknowing reader the impression that there has been no such research until neuroscience came along. Actually, reading development is per- haps not the correct phrase; reading ability manifesta- tion may better capture Shaywitz's concept of how reading skills are realized. The idea that reading dis- orders (and by implication, reading ability potential) "are present at birth and are not acquired" (p. 137) suggests necessary and innate reading modules locat- ed in the brain-or at least innate brain modules that can be put to use in reading, as Shaywitz rightly observes that reading is too recent a cultural inven- tion for humans to have evolved distinct brain mod- ules for it alone. And yet the dysfunction of these modules re- quired for reading, among other things, does not im- pair any other discernable function, leaving open the question of just what nonreading functions these modules ever evolved for. The best guess, which Shaywitz gives, would be for processing spoken lan- guage. But according to Shaywitz, dyslexics often do not show a distinct deficit in language comprehen- sion, indicating that they parse spoken phonemes and identify words adequately for that purpose. So we are left to ponder why 70% or more of the popu- lation possesses modules evolved above and beyond what is necessary for adequately processing spoken language such that they can be applied, happy hap- penstance, for reading. On the other hand, the entire construct of brain modules may possibly be flawed, or at least overly simple (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992; Uttal, 2001). Shaywitz's model in particular, ignor- ing as it does so much extant neurological research on dyslexia, could suffer from this kind of simplicity. If so, the research designs Shaywitz uses at her Yale lab could be flawed, and thus her findings could be potentially epiphenomenal of the theory and tech- nology she employs to generate them. (We shall elaborate on this point subsequently.) Shaywitz makes insufficient allowance for the possibility that some reading deficiencies may be due to lack of adequate preschool literacy modeling or ample language experience in the home (Hart &amp; Risley, 1999), or other socioeconomic factors on children's health and development. These factors are</page><page sequence="7">550 Reading Research Quarterly OCTOBER/NO VEMBER/DECEMBER 2006 41/4 ignored by Shaywitz, who would seem to have read- ers believe that any case of reading difficulty is sim- ply the result of genetically encoded bad wiring in the brain from birth, and that science "proves" it. In this, she falls afoul of the same untenable absolutism as the sociocultural determinists she decries who deny any biological factors in development. The fact that interventions delivered early enough often address reading difficulties suggests that the problem for many, perhaps most, poor read- ers is not neurophysiological destiny but a lack of literacy preparation in optimal contextual circum- stances. Belatedly addressing this experiential dispari- ty does not automatically correct the problem, as we know, because children are organic beings growing through a developmental trajectory that has already been bent by the gravity of early circumstance. A child can only grow forward from where he or she is at any given point in time. Growth rates and trajec- tories are not as malleable as contexts, and so deficits once realized can be persistent. The question of how the difference gets started in the first place, however, is devilishly more difficult than Shaywitz allows. Apparently, Shaywitz has a blind spot for read- ing processes that do not involve decoding, her spe- cial area of investigation. Decoding ability is certainly part of the larger and very complex picture we have of reading processes thanks to cognitive and behav- ioral research. But because the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores she cites to determine percentages of struggling readers indicate both decoding skills and language-comprehension ability, it is problematic to glean from those scores a percentage of students solely phonologically disabled (later in the book she will begrudge readers that 88% of dyslexia is due to decoding problems, but she re- mains unclear about the other 12%). Shaywitz's bias in this regard is made manifest- ly obvious in statements that will surely come as a shock to adolescent literacy professionals and reading comprehension researchers: "[we] can now effectively treat a phonological weakness; while ironically, the complex reasoning and sophisticated thinking skills that dyslexic children often possess are almost im- possible to teach" (p. 53). This idea is subsequently expanded upon. Rote memorization and rapid retrieval are particularly diffi- cult for dyslexics. On the other hand, dyslexics appear to be disproportionately represented in the upper echelons of cre- ativity and in the people who, whether in business, finance, medicine, writing, law, or science, have broken through a boundary and have made a real difference to society. I be- lieve that this is because a dyslexic cannot simply memorize or do things by rote; she must get far underneath the concept and understand it at a fundamental level. This need often leads to deeper understanding and a perspective that is dif- ferent from what is achieved by some for whom things come easier because they just can memorize and repeat-without ever having to deeply and thoroughly understand. (pp. 57-58) If this portrait is accurate, it might suggest that as a matter of educational policy we should stop try- ing to cure dyslexia and begin trying to foment it. More seriously, and sadly, Shaywitz provides no evi- dence that dyslexic children on average are any more gifted in creative or intellectual capabilities than oth- er children, although she does offer some entertain- ing qualitative descriptions of individual cases. We could go on, but we hope the point is clear: This is not the comprehensive text serious stu- dents or scholars should reach for if their goal is to understand the current neurological research on reading difficulties. (For better reviews of current neuroscience, see Berninger &amp; Richards, 2002; Swanson, 2003. For neuroscience on reading diffi- culties, see Katzir &amp; Pard-Blagoev, 2006; Mody, 2004. For a more concise review of Shaywitz's own perspective, see Shaywitz &amp; Shaywitz, 2004a.) In the remainder of this review, we will outline a number of problems with the current rush to reify cognitive models in brain-imaging charts, and then make a plea for more bioecological or organic-generative conceptions of both the nervous and ancillary self- regulation systems, and reading and literacy develop- ment. We feel this review will caution readers to realize that cognitive and developmental neuro- science research has great potential but is still at a very formative stage. It is not nearly definitive, nor is it a compelling means by which to trump essentially theoretical debates about reading. Problems with reifying modular cognitive models of reading There has been a long and fascinating history of debate between modular (Fodor, 1983), distrib- uted (Lashley, 1950), and hybrid (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992) perspectives on mental organization. Discussion of holistic, transactional, and socially ex- tensive theories of mental organization conciliatory with distributed network models of the brain contin- ues to enliven educational research (McEneaney, Lose, &amp; Schwartz, 2006; McVee, Dunsmore, &amp; Gavelek, 2005). But modular models of mind have become the mainstay of most cognitive neuroscience researchers because of the seeming ability of new</page><page sequence="8">Essay Book Review 551 brain-imaging technologies to reify these models by associating theorized modules with discretely activat- ed brain areas. This is the assumption behind the cognitive neuroscience research cited by Shaywitz. Simply put, the modular model approach posits a computational program structure in the mind that processes incoming information (from sensation and long-term memory) and generates outgoing information (as thoughts and behavior). This global program relies in part on smaller au- tonomous operations within the program code. These autonomous mental modules perform func- tional operations on inputs and thereby generate outputs necessary to the larger program. These mod- ules are thought to be cognitively impenetrable, meaning their interior organization and workings are not influenced by what is going on elsewhere in the process, other than through the inputs they receive. Because these modules are discrete, their effects are also discrete, and their presence in the mind can be indicated by factor analysis, and in the brain by dis- association (often lesion or trauma) studies (Bennet &amp; Hacker, 2003). As a closed-system picture of the mind, there is a certain elegance to the model. Unfortunately, model construction often suf- fers from lack of sufficient constraint. Modular mod- els of the mind are numerous, yet their modules are often not correspondent. Carroll (1993) reviewed factor analysis-driven module models and assembled over 50 modules into a concordance. Dismayingly, the result is as idiosyncratic as the source models from which he drew. The scale of analysis at which modules may be delineated is also an issue; whether reading, decoding, phonemic processing, or pitch is the appropriate modular point at which to stop sub- dividing the reading mind has historically been de- bated, and further subdivisions are theoretical possibilities awaiting only the appropriate calculative tools and financial or political incentives. Moreover, figuring out how to dismember na- ture at the joints is not as simple as model construc- tion. Poeppel (1996) attributed lack of replication in five positron emission tomography (PET) studies at- tempting to localize phonological processing in the brain to insufficiently detailed task-decomposition and task-control matching. Two other problems he identified with these studies were insufficient famil- iarity between the various disciplines collaborating, and inherent problems with using subtractive PET methodology to image language processes. Grafman, Partiot, and Hollnagel (1995) generated a list of cog- nitive processes associated with the frontal cortex that spanned seven pages. Uttal (2001) observed, Obviously, either investigators have discovered a region of the brain that is involved in everything (a real possibility) or their idiosyncratic definition of psychological processes is much too varied. If the latter, this is prima facie evidence of a breakdown in a systematic definition of psychological processes. If the former, what better argument could be made against even a limited form of localization? (p. 202) Let us remember that models of the reading mind are basically visualizable descriptive analogies, or, rudimentarily, "a mental picture or representa- tional physical system of a phenomenon" (National Science Teachers Association, 1996). Whether repre- sentations-to-scale or operative metaphors, models are always analogical. They illuminate something that is not well understood by way of something that is. But this always implies identity of the phenome- non under investigation with something it is not. Such analogies can be inspiring for theory construc- tion, but they are fundamentally false. In most ways that matter, the analog is not like the phenomenon under consideration. To use novel and formative technologies to reify such analogies as ontological certainties seems an attempt born of frustration to end-run around the necessity of theory construction and testing in scientific research. Interestingly, this aversion resonates with clearly articulated disaffec- tion for reading theory and philosophy expressed by some cognitive neuroscientists (e.g., Lyon et al., 2005)-an overreaction, perhaps, to perceived theo- retical excesses in past educational scholarship. Problems with neuroimaging interpretation There is often confusion among many nonspe- cialists when admiring the rainbow-colored charts produced by PET or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology that what they are see- ing is a picture of a brain (or, worse, the brain) in ac- tion. Rather, what they are viewing is a statistical chart of averaged subject set data involving weighted algorithms to indicate differentials between two ex- perimental conditions. Were we, as educational re- searchers, to be reminded more often that these images are displays of calculated statistical data and not photographs of a brain in action, we could bring to bear the critical scrutiny we typically apply to sta- tistics in educational research. And in doing so we would ask harder questions of cognitive neuroscience research on reading and its assertions than we typi- cally have.</page><page sequence="9">552 Reading Research Quarterly OCTOBER/NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2006 41/4 These data, after all, are generally gleaned from a usually small and nonrandom subject population, cleaned up with signal-noise ratio constraints that in novel conditions are largely a matter of guesswork, and subjected to subtractive and enhancing method- ologies, and the result of all this is then averaged. Atypically large percentages of subjects whose data do not reinforce emphatic "images" are rejected from the study as outliers. The techniques themselves, particu- larly for cognitive research, are still very formative, and they involve collaborative teams of researchers from a range of specialties who are left to negotiate, as best they can determine, the linking of their com- plementary expertise in order to bridge their individ- ual and mutual misunderstandings (Dumit, 2004). Given these formative limitations, confirmation stud- ies are crucial, yet, for most of the cognitive neuro- science work being appropriated by educational neuroscience theorists, they are often lacking. For instance, as noted, Poeppel (1996) re- viewed five PET studies attempting to localize phonological processing (in part inspired by Shaywitz, Shaywitz, et al., 1995). His review revealed that these research teams did indeed do just that, and with apparent confidence, but with little or no overlap of the areas each identified. Pulvermiiller (1999) mapped six studies (all but one from 1999) localizing word-meaning processing. Frontal, occipi- tal, and temporal lobe areas (i.e., spanning much of the cortex) were variously favored. Most noteworthy, perhaps, Harpaz (1999, cited in Uttal, 2001, p. 201) found that in 116 out of 125 fMRI or PET studies, there was not a single attempt to replicate the find- ings of another study. The little replication data Harpaz could find were largely negative. It might be argued that it is unfair to expect sufficient replication for meta-analyses in an imma- ture field such as cognitive neuroscience. But that is precisely the point. Cognitive neuroscience, as hard, technical, and fundamentally biological as it may seem, is still largely a matter of formative inquiry and speculative model testing; it is a long way from providing us definitive proof of modular models of mind or reading. We do not mean to suggest that brain-imaging technology is dubious or fraudulent. Far from it. It is tremendously useful in answering the questions about brain physiology for which it was designed (questions of operative structure and function in the organic brain). It just may not be anywhere near as useful in answering questions about the structure and function of our mechanistic mind models, let alone of how best to teach reading, as some would claim. And when brain-imaging data are used by those who would pitch commercial products, ideo- logical positions, or funding grants, usually to an au- dience insufficiently knowledgeable about the nature of the images they are admiring, these errors, at the very least, can foment leaps of fancy and interpreta- tions well beyond the data. As Louis Sokoloff, a pio- neer of the nuclear medicine that informs these methods, noted in a 1991 Society for Neuroscience plenary session, "We know we need to hype to get our grants. Let's try to keep it out of our results" (in Dumit, 2004, p. 185). (For further discussion of problematic interpretation of brain-imaging data re- garding reading, see Strauss, 2005, in particular pp. 73-91.) Underappreciating the brain as a complex organic system Organic entities such as brains are in many ways similar to machines such as computers in that their structure can be understood to account for their function, hence the common cognitive metaphor of the mind as an information-processing machine being applied to the brain in cognitive neu- roscience. But organic entities are also unlike mecha- nistic entities in that their structures change over time as a result of agent-context transactions, gener- ally on behalf of functionality given particular envi- ronmental constraints. As a result, organic structures change over time due to changes in adaptive func- tionality. Thus, living things, like students, grow, change, and develop abilities like reading-given ap- propriate environmental encounters. Even the most condensed and reductive physi- ological accounts of brain structure allow for the shifting nature of morphology across multiple scales of structural and temporal organization, including the neuroendocrinological and biochemical scales, as a result of contextual influence, with changing func- tional effect (e.g., Berninger &amp; Richards, 2002; Swanson, 2003, in particular pp. 206-218). The emergence of infant affect self-regulation as a result of infant-caregiver transactions, including its neu- roendocrinological correlates, is an interesting exam- ple of this (Schore, 1994). As a result, it is not possible to definitively trace cause from function in organic entities as simply as one might trace cause from structure in a machine, a point Shaywitz seems to deliberately overlook in interpreting her brain- imaging studies. A machine is a structure that has been deliber- ately designed for achieving certain functions.</page><page sequence="10">Essay Book Review 553 Researchers who rely on mechanistic assumptions about phenomena under investigation study struc- ture to determine how structure causes function and, through experimentation, to see how changes in a structure affect function. Research selected by the National Reading Panel (NICHD, 2000) for its vari- ous reports was judged for inclusion by virtue of whether, among other standards, it assumed the phe- nomenon under investigation confirmed that "cause preceded effect," as it would do in a machine. By contrast, living organizational forms are dis- tinguished by structure and function being coregula- tive and cocausative. In other words, for life-science researchers employing organicist assumptions, not only does structure allow for function, and changes in structure cause changes in function, as the mecha- nistic view assumes, but also change in function can direct and cause changes in structure over time. This is not because an emergent intentionality makes de- liberate decisions to change structure in order to ef- fect different behavior (which would be an anthropomorphic or teleological assumption, useful only when addressing human-like agency). Rather, organic systems generate and regenerate by repro- ducing their structures, such as cells or neural net- works, but, importantly, these reiterations occur with a certain degree of variability. Such variation be- comes a fulcrum for selective adaptation on behalf of functionality given contextual, often changing, and unpredictable circumstances. Thus, over time and re- iterations, function drives structure. Occasionally, of course, dysfunctional structures emerge. There are other generative dynamics that can distinguish organisms from machines, but the algo- rithm of adaptive variation is the one most easily grasped and has been implicated in learning (Plotkin, 2004). Research employing mechanistic as- sumptions for the sake of revealing structural me- chanics is undeniably helpful, but in the case of complex organic entities and processes it is overly constrained (Rosen, 1991). Organicist, system-based assumptions are the more appropriate framework for studying organic entities such as brains in their en- tirety and in relation to the ecological surrounds to which they respond. Although Shaywitz and other cognitive neuro- scientists prefer to think of the brain as a reification of cognitive structure, mechanistic, reductive, and zero-sum, it would be fair to say that most neurosci- entists are not cognitive neuroscientists (consider the paucity of such work in the multivolume annual conference program of the Society for Neuroscience). Indeed, there is a much longer histo- ry and critical mass of current research studying psy- chobiological correlates to behavior for what they are: evolved organic entities and processes with coregulatory structural-functional organization. Underappreciating the brain on its own terms In Overcoming Dyslexia, Shaywitz underplays the tremendous neurological variability that can be found between individuals, a signature of reiterated organic structure if ever there was one. We get a hint of this when the author discusses her intriguing fMRI results suggesting women process phonological stimuli bilaterally, whereas men seem to be more unilateral. A careful reading of the original article (and a brief clue in this text) indicates that not all women showed bilateral representation for phono- logical processes. In other words, what is missing in Shaywitz's treatment is the case-by-case variability that is averaged away in the construction of brain images and that unfortunately attenuates any indica- tion of the variability found in the original data sets of either typical or atypical subjects. Anyone who has worked closely with dyslexic children sees this tremendous variability from child to child, so the one-dimensional brain result presented here oversim- plifies how uniquely variable functional brain images can be. In addition, when the author provides her apt discussion of the lesion studies, she neglects to men- tion that the individuals described in the literature often had epilepsy or other motor impairments in- cluding oral motor problems. It is easy to misunder- stand what these lesion studies represent and the important distinction between necessary and suffi- cient conditions. Lesion studies indicate that a stroke or specific brain damage may impair the functioning of a specific area where the damage occurs, but such damage can often also impair the functioning of nearby connections and, as a consequence, may cause disruption to their role in either cognitive or perceptual tasks. In fact, in some of these lesion cases it is almost impossible to differentiate the impact of the lesion due to the loss or damage of a structure and the more overarching dysfunction of the larger and dis- tributed system to which that area is a vital compo- nent. These lesion studies indicate when a particular region of the brain is an important component of a larger distributed system, but it is difficult to say that a region is either sufficient for or uniquely essential to a particular function. Although this point may</page><page sequence="11">554 Reading Research Quarterly OCTOBER/NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2006 41/4 seem esoteric, it is important to understand that the brain functions as a network of interconnected sys- tems. Therefore, when a lesion or dysfunction occurs, or insufficient activation of a region is evi- denced by an fMRI study, all one can say is that that region of the brain seems to participate in the func- tional system that underlies a studied ability. It can- not be concluded conclusively that the area is solely responsible for a given ability or a specific disability. Brain modules, in other words, are not as au- tonomous or impenetrable as mind modules. Dedication of brain structure to particular functions is also notoriously plastic. That certain areas of the brain are focused for particular functions is undeni- able, but this is probably more the result of physio- logical, developmental, or evolutionary constraint than functional necessity. The cortex does not func- tion on the (essentially epiphenomenal) macro- cortical level imagined in fMRI studies, although that level may indeed reflect lower level operational structures. All of which is to say that structure-at the genetic, proteomic, synaptic, cytological, net- work, and gyral levels of organization-is crucial, but its importance is only fairly grasped if all perti- nent levels of structural organization, tracked over time, are taken into account. Yet the imaging tech- nologies Shaywitz and other cognitive neuroscientists employ cannot provide such a multidimensional ac- count, particularly when matched with fairly simple unidimensional, mechanistic models of mental struc- ture and operation. And it is important to remember that there are still higher levels of coregulation at work in this system, including cortical subsystem- neuroendocrinological, neuroendocrinological- organism, and organism-ecological surround (including social, linguistic, and semiotic surrounds). Consider an example of the complexity of de- velopment in organic structures, as illustrated in the research on cortical architecture in the brains of dyslexics. This research indicates that there are varia- tions in the way young neurons migrate to their eventual functional location during fetal develop- ment that disable regions known to be involved in the reading process. Galaburda (2006) has conclud- ed that dyslexia is most likely due to the mutation of a gene that influences neural migration out to the cortex between the 16th to the 24th week of fetal gestation. Consequently, a substantial literature now suggests that developmental dyslexia is most likely due to either mutations in genes that control brain development or variability in the way that the brain organizes itself during fetal development, such that the resultant cortical structures do not fully support processes important for the early perception of speech sounds. What this work asserts is that there is signifi- cant variability and atypicality identifiable in cortical migration that occurs prior to birth in the brains of some individuals who subsequently demonstrate se- vere reading disabilities (e.g., Leppanen, Eklund, &amp; Lyytinen, 1997). Second, linkages on various chro- mosomes seem to be related to mutations that have demonstrated effects on neuronal migration (Meng et al., 2005). Third, this variability seems to show up in the more visible gyral patterns of the brain. There is considerable research during the previous two decades that shows that structures known to be im- portant in linguistic processing are morphologically different in the brains of individuals with severe reading disabilities. It does seem that structure matters, and that structural variation that occurs in the parisylvian re- gion of the brain is associated with variability in neurolinguistic abilities (Hiemenz &amp; Hynd, 2000). Moreover, it should be noted that, whether through normal variability and development or through the influence of mutated genes or atypical environments, there is good evidence to suggest that numerous structures in the brain are implicated in severe read- ing disabilities, including variability in the structure of the corpus callosum (the bundle of nerves that connect the two hemispheres of the brain), the cere- bellum (important both in certain cognitive process- es and for the coordination of motor movements), and other subcortical systems, systems not imaged in the studies preferred by Shaywitz. Conclusion: Reading via organic process? The points made above to do not exhaust the difficulties with mapping cognitive models onto the organic brain. For instance, there is always the dan- ger of overt data manipulation, cherry-picking, or other forms of misrepresentative finagling. In a re- cent review of research submissions to the Journal of Cell Biology since 2002, the editors of that journal discovered that 25% of the accompanying photo- graphs had been substantively manipulated by digital photo software (Wade, 2006). Given the amount of guesswork required to generate brain images using the current technology, the possibility of guessing wrong but in dependable directions is possibly high. But perhaps the greatest problem of all with these kinds of brain/mind studies, as noted above, is</page><page sequence="12">Essay Book Review 555 the use of mechanistic metaphors of cognition to make sense of an essentially organic set of phenome- na. Nowhere has this problem been better confront- ed than in developmental science, where developmental-contextualist (i.e., organicist) inter- pretive frameworks have come to dominate the disci- pline as an antidote to reductive mechanism (for a review, see Lerner, 1998). The modular approach to parsing reading ability and brain processes is poten- tially out of sync with this developmental-contextu- alist science, and it is also out of synch with an emerging dynamical-process approach to integrating neuroscience research in particular subdomains with- in a shared systems-based framework (Science, 2005). Reading education researchers should under- stand that the term developmentalin developmental science is not a synonym for innate, as it is loosely employed in special education (Franklin, 1994). Rather, developmental means that which relates to the dynamics of change over time in organic entities due to the transactive relationship of agents and con- texts across varying, coregulatory levels of spatial and temporal, structural and functional, and genetic and developmental organization (Gottlieb, 2003; Lerner, 1998, Oyama, 2002). The result is generative or emergent phenomena, the kind of phenomena that set living entities apart from simple machines. Such a systems-based approach to developmental research on intentional behavior and children's learning is currently being explored (Fischer et al., 2006; Fischer &amp; Katzir, in press; Jacobson &amp; Wilensky, 2006; Juarrero, 2002; Siegler, 2005; Sumara, 2000), and may hold potential for reading education schol- arship and reading disability research. Although a compelling argument can be made for the primacy of cognitive psychology in interpret- ing neuroscience findings for educational practice and research (Bruer, 1997, 2003, in press), this argu- ment seems to overlook the educational history of just such cognitive primacy (Pearson, 2004). We ac- knowledge that the cognitive research paradigm has generated, and will likely continue to generate, many useful insights on reading process, education, and practice. But it has also generated its fair share of dis- appointments and dissatisfactions. It is not as if the field of reading education has not chafed at the limitations of this perspective at some length. Mechanistic accounts of structural relations simply cannot address everything we want to explore in the field of reading education, particularly if we wish to tackle such complex and multidimensional issues as comprehension, motivation, and literate identity. If the brain is a crucial locus of learning and behavioral response, as we believe research clearly demonstrates, then a theoretical framework that can understand the organic brain on its own terms, rather than on merely cognitive-representational terms, might well prove inspired. Viewing the litera- ture on reading research from the perspective of de- velopmental neuroscience would certainly be a novel turn. Such a developmental systems lens might help us understand the organic reading brain as part of a larger organic and social world-one that reading brains are not merely in, but of(i.e., understood as informing the brain's structure, development, func- tion, and evolution). This might uncomfortably sug- gest a new reading process critique, one seemingly more informed by the dynamics of Darwin than of Marx, but it would certainly not be a critique that would short the importance of social, linguistic, or cultural contingency and legacy. Systems-based inter- disciplinary studies are helping to unify the neuro- sciences and the life sciences, and increasingly are informing the social sciences. We look forward to the day they might similarly contribute to educa- tional science and reading research. But we acknowl- edge that day is not yet at hand. GEORGE G.
