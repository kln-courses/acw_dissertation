<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS Causality: The Place of the Causal Principle in Modern Science. By MARIO BUNGE. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachu- setts (London: Oxford University Press), 1959. Pp. xx+ 380. 6Cs. ARE the grimy old bottles with the soggy old labels 'causation', 'causal- ity', ' causal law', etc., suitable for decanting the new wines of modem science ? Some think them appropriate enough for those who don't drink direct from the spigot. Others line them up for sniping practice. Pro- fessor Bunge is more meticulous. In the cellars of the Almighty there are many bins. Causal determination is but one of an irreducible variety of interconnected categories such as self-determination, mechanical deter- minationi, interaction, statistical determination, structural determination, teleological determination and dialectical determination. He explores their distinctiveness and interconnections with illuminating concreteness and diversity of illustration, seeking at the very least an approximate application for each form within mutually delimiting spheres. From his pen the standard claim that the examples are all readily intelligible to scientifically and mathematically undisciplined minds is for once true (almost): my verdict here is definitive. His display of professional skill is withal entirely free from that unpleasing brashness with which too many practitioners in this field seem bent upon intimidating the technically naive into taking what is superficial on trust. On the other hand some of his philosophically more ambitious findings forfeit all intimacy with his examples through negligent formulation. The fault is an underlying duality of purpose. His concern is not merely to dispose of a number of category confusions, but to scotch the fundamental error endemic among writers whom he stigmatises variously as " trans- cendentalists ', '- idealists ', ' subjectivists ', ' sensationists ', ' positivists ', 'neo-positivists ', ' empiricists ', and ' Humeans '. He confutes them successfully enough on issues peripheral to what is nearest his heart, viz. an ontological interpretation of determination. But his vinadication of the latter is an ignoratio elenchi. He shows that its critics have confused the specific category of causation with the generic category of determination, or else have wrongly characterised the specific category in some way. Since, however, the Humean type of attack applies to the ontological interpretation of the generic category irrespective of whether the latter bas been wrongly identified with more specific forms or whether these have been wrongly characterised, this mode of argument fails in its objective. On his interpretation the key category, determination, has two mutually independent but equally essential components, viz. productivity and law- fulness. Thus the principle of determination involves (1) the productivity (or genetic) principle that nothing comes out of nothing, and (2) the principle of lawfulness that nothing happens in an unconditional and altogether irregular way. Creation ex nihilo is debarred by the first, and complete randomness by the second. Now what account does the first principle take of the lHumean type of criticism that outside the context of human action productivity is an anthropomorphic figment of which science should rid itself in exchange for some more specific form of the second principle ? The verb 'produce', after a1l, is commonly -used simply to indicate an agent employing some means in order to bring some- thing about. Certainly Professor Bunge has no effective reply. He 107</page><page sequence="2">108 NEW BOOKS suggests a distinctioll between relations and connections, leaving the elucidation to a cryptic footnote. Evidently 'taller than' signifies a mere relation whereas 'par,tner of' signifies a connective relation: and productivity is of this last kind (p. 6). The only interpretation I can set upon this distinction leads directly to the conclusion that the second principle is more fundamental than the first. If the two relations are significantly distinguishable, it is because the type instanced by partner- ship consists of dispositions among individuals to behave in certain osten- sively definable ways towards each other. If, then, statements referring to dispositions are analysable into hypotheticals or law-like statements, and if productivity is a connection in virtue of being a disposition, it would seem to follow that productivity is less basic than lawfulness. Therefore the ontological status of determination cannot very well depend upon the productivity component as distinct from lawfulness. If, on the other hand, Professor Bunge were to base it on the latter instead (but he does not), he would have to fend off the complementary Eumean attack upon necessary connection in nature as an objective correlate of law. Either way Hume has still to be answered. The specific form of determination which Bunge distinguishes as causal presents additional difficulties. It involves a peculiar form of one-sided productivity which becomes evident in, while being distinct from, what he calls existential priority or succession (p. 39). Ele associates this in- tractable notion with the priority of protasis over apodosis in the formula 'If C then (and only then) E always ' (p. 42), where the parenthesis in- dicates that the relation between C and E is one-one. But obviously the parenthetical clause must cancel the priority: for the complete formula is equivalent to 'For all C and E, if C happens then E happens, and if E happens then C happens'. Existential priority in other words is consistent with a many-one relation alone, but on his classification (p. 4) many-one relations belong to statistical and not to causal determination. Equally perplexing is his undefended analvsis of necessity and the 'if-then always' formula solely in terms of constant and unique conjunction (pp. 8, 39, 43 ff.). This seems to omit the courterfactual core of law-like statements, which no productivity component can replace. His definition of causal determination does indeed include one empirically respectable differentiating mark. The firing of a bullet against a window is the causal condition of the glass breaking because it is external to what it determines. On the other band the antecedent positions and velocities of a freely moving macroscopic body are conditions, but not causal con- ditions, of its later positions and velocities. Both sets of states in the latter example belong to the same thing: and consequently illustrate self- determination. This empirical mark, however, proves to be a cuckoo in the ontological nest in two ways. (a) Any application of the external- internal dichotomy depends upon a frame of reference: no distinction marked in this way can be absolute. How then can the distinction between causation and self-determination be irreducible or ontological ? (b) The external conditions of any given change are never entirely sufficient: internal conditions are always indispensable as well. Now is this a matter of empirical fact or of logical necessity ? Bunge apparently assumes the former for he argues from the -premiss that external conditions are never sufficient to the conclusion that the causal category has only an ap- proximate application (pp. 336 ff.). But it is at.least arguable that the incompatibility between externality and sufficiency is really a logical one and that hence any attempt to combine the two within the concept of</page><page sequence="3">NEW fO00KS 109 causal determination leads not merely to inapplicability but to logical incoherence. His distinction between causal determination and interaction in terms of unidirectional and reciprocal production or action leads to further trouble. When we use words such as ' produce ', ' act ', ' react ' or ' inter- act 'it is natural to regard their subjects as agents, i.e. things or continuants rather than events or occurrents'. Initially (cf. p. 47) when discussing causal connection in terms of the first of these verbs Professor Bunge seems to resist this anthropomorphic tendenev. He gives one to under- stand that cause and effect are events. Both his description and illus- tration of interaction as a form of determination in which effect reacts on cause amounts, on the other hand, to total surrender. If cause and effect are events this reaction is logically impossible. Continuants alone can be changed or reacted upon. They alone may retain identity throughout change. Events, in contrast, are the changes of continuants. They do not themselves change without loss of identity. Interaction then, shouldn't be differentiated from causation in terms of the distinction be- tween reciprocal and unidirectional action. It fits more accurately into the slot for self-determination. Thus, to adapt one of his examples for interaction, the law of gravity which governs the manner in which two masses interact can alternatively be described as the law governing the internal development of the complex system consisting of the two masses. It deals directly with the relation between occurrents, and hence with a form of determination co-ordinate with causation, under this aspect alone. The destructive argument in this book carries greater conviction-as when he discountenances the claim that contiguity, or successiveness, or finctional dependenie are marks of causal connection, or that the differen- tial equation, or any other mathematical form, is exclusively the dis- tinguishing mark of a quantitatively expressed causal law. Equally instructive is his outstanding regard for the indefinite variety in the modes of scientific explanation. One must conclude, however, that he has not rehabilitated the causal categories with unqualified success. In particular if the notion of productivity is to be retained at all, it should be purged more scrupulously of its misleading associations. It is a matter for regret thatin anotherwise historicallywell-documented workbackedbyanimposing bibliography he makes no reference to the sort of viewpoint first expressed clearly in Collingwood's 'On the So-called Idea of Causation' (PAS, 1937-38) and tidied up by Gasking's 'Causation and Recipes' (MIND, 1955). Had he done so he might also have removed some of the obstacles latent in our use of causal terminology which have stood in the way of his attaining his end. K. W. RANKIN The Moral Point of Vieu. By KURT BAIER. Cornell University Press (London: Oxford University Press), 1958. Pp. xii + 326. Price 32s. THIs is one of the half-dozoii best books on ethics of the decade. At a time when so many moral philosophers are occupied with consolidation, reassessment and modification of established positions, Baier is not afraid to break new ground, including much that has recently been strenuously declared sterile. Written in the best style and idiom of Oxford philosophy (owing, for example, a conspicuous debt to the Concept of Mind), it will</page><page sequence="4">10 NEW BOOKS appeal especially to those who feel that modern analytical ethics has not really come to grips with the fundamental ethical issues. Here they are raised right at the start. "Why should we do what is right?" " Why do we do what is right? " "How do we know what is right?" Even the ultimate " Why should we be moral? " is a serious question and has an irmportant answer. The style is admirably clear, simple and forthright, free of jargon, and a brisk racy tone is sustained even through long passages of argument. Examples-a common pitfall of ethical theorists-are, for once, real, live and abundant. Indeed, critics' grumbles, heard not so long ago, about unposted letters, are now so out of date that we may soon be complaining instead about a surfeit of sex. Certainly the frequency of examples like " If you did not love me, you should not have kissed me in that way " suggests that Australian universities provide moral philosophy with a more favourable environment than that which Professor Broad notoriously attributed to Cambridge colleges. Morality, for Baier, is a branch of practical reasoning. The practical question is " What shall I do? " The answer to that is not, pace Hare, a command, but a value judgment. A value judgment has two components: a factual claim, in virtue of which it is verifiable, and an action-guiding element, in virtue of which it is open to validation. Its form is " The best thing to do is X ". This in turn means " X is the course of action sup- ported by the best reasons ". Reasons are relevant facts. The question whether or not a fact is relevant to, or a " consideration " in, a certain practical question, is settled by what Baier calls " consideration-making beliefs ". These are " rules of reason " and form the major premisses or practical deliberation. " Considerations " may conffict, as in the case of self-interest and morality. Accordingly there are also second-order beliefs about the superiority of one type of reason over another. These enable reasons to be " weighed " so as to yield the " best " or " weightiest" reason. Successive chapters survey (i) individual rules of reason, such as those concerned with enjoyment and self-interest (with an acute analysis, typical of many such incidental passages, of the distinctions between enjoying, liking, desiring and wanting); (ii) social rules, such as those of law, custom and religion; and (iii) moral considerations. Here, in chap- ters VII and VIII, we reach the central thesis. The " moral point of view" is described as follows: it is " that of an independent, unbiased, impartial, objective, dispassionate, disinterested observer . . . a God's-eye point of view This Baier recognises as essentially Kantian, ignoring however the closer version of lRume (Hume is discussed at great length and dis- missed, elsewhere, for his doctrine of reason and passion). For Kant's Universalisability Principle, Baier substitutes a " principle of reversibility ", itself a reformulation of the negative version of the Golden Rule: be- haviour is wrong if it violates the condition that it " must be acceptable to a person whether he is at the 'giving ' or ' receiving ' end of it" (p. 202). But why should we adopt such a "point of view ", seeing that we thereby resign ourselves to acting aga?inst our own interests? Why, in other words, are moral reasons " weightier " than all others? The answer is simple: " the very raison d'etre of a morality is to yield reasons which overrule the reasons of self-interest in those cases when everyone's following self- interest would be harmful to everyone." And if it is still questioned why such overruling reasons should interest us, the answer is that " we are</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS 111 examining two alternative worlds, one in which moral reasons are always treated by everyone as superior to reasons of self-interest and one in which the reverse is the practice " (p. 310). The second world is the Hobbesian state of nature, and one glance should convince us that " the best possible life for everyone " is possible only in the first world. The most controversial part of Baier's thesis is the proof that moral judgments are true or false, and its,corollary that there are true moralities and a (true) " absolute " morality. There are two proofs and an appeal to common usage. The appeal takes the form: " A person . . . does not know what he is talking about if he believes that finding out whether some course of action is contrary to the morality of a certain group settles the question whether this course of action is morally wrong. " Now Baier certainly has no undue respect for ordinary language, and it is only fair to add that he does not rest his case on this appeal. The two proofs are .rather uncomfortably related. One refers to the truth of " consideration- making beliefs", a point long postponed from Chapters III to XII. 1. Here it is argued simply-and fallaciously-that " the premiss is true if the argument is valid and if it is true that the course of action recommended in the conclusion . . . is the best course open to the agent ". The other proof is in terms of " moral convictions " (chap. VII). " Killing is wrong " is true if (1) killing does in fact constitute the contravention of a certain sort of rule, and (2) the rule itself is one for which there are " eertain tests ". The " test " turns out to be: acceptability from the moral point of view; and this is the reversibility test. Now the case for this criterion of moral truth would have been much stronger if Baier had followed Hume's example of discussing " steady and general points of view " in terms of the analogy with observation-statements. There is indeed a " reversibility test " for truth: if what I assert is not something I am prepared to accept when you assert it, I am not claiming truth for it. As it is, the reversi- bility-test as a criterion of moral truth seems very questionable. " Killing" is too easy an example: is it always so obvious that, and in what sense, wrong actions are " detrimental " or " unacceptable " to others? Not all moral actions involve reciprocity; what about cruelty to animals, or my moral conviction that I ought to engage in polio research? True and false moral judgments being determined by the reversibility- test, it follows that moral codes which contain only true ones are truie, that others are false, and that there is an "absolute morality" which all trule moralities have as their " core ". "Killing is wrong " is " society- neutral" and belongs to absolute morality; "adultery is wrong" is society-dependent and is true only in certain social conditions. But it soon appears that the absolute precepts have many " recognised exceptions ". It is by no means clear, and to me highly doubtful, whether the reversibility- test will yield both the society-neutral exceptions and the society-depen- dent variations. In any case, the extreme generality of the absolute precepts strains to the limit the partnership of truth-value with action- guiding, the double aspect of mora.l judgments which is central to Baier's thesis. There is no discussions of the free-will problem, or of the concept of moral virtues; and althoug1l many objections are entertained in a livelY Socratic fashion, there is no attempt to deal with the modern counter- Kantians, or with the objection that moral value-judgments are not necessarily, or even characteristically, U-type judgments. But such omis- sions are heavily outweighed by the many illuminating discussions of the subsidiary topics, such as the various senses of " rule ", the analysis of</page><page sequence="6">112 NEW BOOKS pleasure and pain, the comparison of the " faoulties " of reason and sight, the problem of self-regarding duties, and many others. BERNARD MAYO Physics and Philosophy. By WERNER HEISENBERG. London: Allen and Unwin, 1959. Pp. 176. 15s. THEn chapters of this book Mwere read as Gifford Lectures at the UTniversity of St. Andre-s during the winter term 1955-56. The author, one of the most famous theoretical physicists of the century, did not observe the founder's intention that the Lecturer should " freely discuss all questions about man's conceptions of God or the Infinite, their origin, nature and truth . . . "; instead he chose as his theme the revolution in modern physics and its historical-philosophical background. Nevertheless, it was thought appropriate that his book should appear in the WVorld Perspectives series which is dedicated to the thesis that man is developing a new aware- ness which " can eventually lift the human race above and beyond the fear, ignorance, brutality and isolation which beset it today ". Despite this high-minded intention, the present volume is an extremely slovenly production. Page after page is disfigured by the most glaring misprints. Some are mere errors of spelling, but others are more serious, e.g. " indepen- dence " for " derertdence ", " Lorentz contradiction " for " Lorentz contraction" (more than once). Furthermore, there is no index. Pre- sumably, the blame for these mistakes and omissions ought not to be laid on the author-who, after all, is not writing in his native tongue-but on those concerned in producing the book from his manuscript. I cannot kelp feeling that potential purchasers would be well advised to wait for a new impression. All this is a great pity because, as might be expected, Professor Heisenberg has much to say that is important and stimulating. He begins with a lively account of the history of quantum theory, culminating in the so-called Copenhagen interpretation. Perhaps the most interesting philosophical point he makes is that modern physics has resuscitated and given a new meaning to Aristotle's idea of substance as ' potentiality'; for, we can compare this with the modern concept of energy which is reified by 'form ' when elementary particles are created from it. Heisenberg continues his philosophical study of modern physics with a fascinating historical comparison with ancient Greek views on atomism and related topics and with the philosophy of classical physics since Descartes. There are illuminating chapters on relativity, on the various counter-proposals by Bohm and others to the Copenhagen interpretation, and on modern ideas concerning the structure of matter. The book ends with two chapters of a more general character, one on language and reality in modern physics, and the other on the role of modern physics in human thought. Heisenberg maintains that atoms and elementary particles are not as 'real ' as the phenomena of everyday life and that they form a world of potentialities or possibilities, rather than one of things or facts. Furthermore, he argues that, for all their vagueness, the concepts of natural language are more stable than those of natural science because they are more directly related to ' reality ', whereas the latter are idealisations that must be fitted into a mathematical scheme which changes with the advance of knowledge. They therefore represent only a "tendency toward reality ".</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS 113 Although the reader who bas no familiarity with the technical aspects of the ideas discussed by the author will often be out of his depth, there is much in this book that will repay careful study by all who strive to under- stand the world they live in-whether at the physical or the human level. For, in the words of Maitland: " Wbat men have done and said, above all what they have thought, that is history." G. J. WHITROW Logical Positivism. Edited with an introduction by A. J. AYER. The Free Press, 1959. Pp. 455. 42s. TnEE book is a member of the series "The Library of Philosophical Movements ". Its aim, one supposes, is to present the leading ideas of logical positivism by way of a representative selection from the writings of major figures within the movement. It certainly brings this off. It does a little more, in that it also looks before and after positivism proper. Professor Ayer has included Russell's " Logical Atomism " (1924). As well as being there for its own sake, this comes more or less close to representing the earlier ideas of Wittgenstein. (One must accept, surely, Ayer's reason for including nothing of Wittgenstein's-that extracts would be mutilation.) To illustrate what comes after the movement, Ayer has included Ryle's "Philosophical Arguments " and Waismann's " How I see Philosphy ". The latter is of particular interest in a book of this kind in that it shows, for one member of the Wiener Kreis, how near the philosophical revolution came to turning a full circle. In this article the philosophical influence, and at times even the style, of the later Wittgen- stein are quite tangible. Though it is abundantly clear that this is not mere second-hand Wittgenstein. That the scope of the selection is, in this way, wider than the somewhat narrow movement no-one, I suppose, will regret. The bulk of the selection consists of articles from the thirties, many of them resurrected from Erkenntnis. The ideas in them are too familiar to bear either exposition or the sort of brief and general criticism appro- priate to a review such as this. The articles show the sense of exhilaration in-and also suggest the disastrous consequences of-wielding the bright new weapon, so much sharper than the obsolete razor. What the con- sequences were is made clearer in Ayer's Introduction and also in a latter- day positivistic article by C. G. Hempel " The Empiricist Criterion of Meaning " (1950). Besides the writers so far mentioned there are articles by Schlick, Carnap, Rans Hahn, Neurath, Ayer, Stevenson and Ramsey. Nine articles appear in English for the first time in this book. The editor's introduction is clear and lively. It is partly historical and partly critical. There is a copious bibliography (about 60 pages long) at the end of the book. The scope of this goes far beyond positivism itself and covers pretty completely what might be generally labelled the Analy- tical philosophy of this century. It is good to have all this in one volume. G. C. NERLICH Insight. By B. J. F. LONERGAN, S.J. Lougmans Green &amp; Co. Pp. 785. 32s. THis book is a return to philosophy on the grand scale. What is offered, to quote the dust-jacket, is " a view of human life and knowledge as a 8</page><page sequence="8">114 NEW BOOKS whole ". Mathematics, physics, common sense, ethics, and theology all come within Father Lonergan's purview, and the thinkers whom he dis- cusses include Einstein, Schr6dinger, and Freud, as well as Galileo, Newton, and Darwin. His aim is not to increase our insight into any one particular discipline, but to give us " insight into insight " (preface, p. ix), to help us to " understand what it is to understand " (p. 748). The book is not an easy one. It is written in an idiom which philosophers unfamiliar with Thomism will find obscure and even exasperating. "Beingf ", we are told, "is the objective of the pure desire to know" (p. 348). Metaphysics is " the conception, affirmation, and implement- ation of the integral heuristic structure of proportionate being " (p. 391). Despite Father Lonergan's scholarly attempts at elucidation, many readers will no doubt miss the stylistic simplicity of writers such as Berkeley and Hume; and although many individual points made by Father Lonergan seem to me to be valuable (e.g. in particular his discussion of probability and some of his remarks on Freud), I am still not con- vinced that the search for a master-key to the whole of knowledge is justified. One wishes Father Lonergan had concerned himself with family resemblances between the different types of sentence which we are said to " know" or " understand ", rather than tried to discover what is " the nature" of knowledge or understanding in general. Finally, Father Lonergan gives the impression at times of having mis- construed what he is doing. He is clearly not making a psychological study of insight (his book would in that case presumably have included statistical tables and summaries of the results of experiments on problem- solving), but he speaks at times as though he is doing a sort of para-science of an arm-chair kind. " Just as every statement in theoretical science can be shown to imply statements regarding sensible fact, so every state- ment in philosophy and metaphysics can be shown to imply statements regarding cognitional fact" (preface, p. xi). Throughout the book "knowing " is assumed to be the name of an " activity " whose " struc- ture " we can examine by arm-chair methods. Further attention to the logic of words such as " know ", "understand ", and " recognise" seems to me of crucial importance here. If the verb "know ", like e.g. the verb " walk ", stood for an activity, it would have a use in the present con- tinuous tense. One would " do " some knowing just as one does some walking; there would be " knowers " just as there are walkers, and one -could analyse what is involved in knowing just as one can analyse what is involved in walking. To me at least, however, " I am doing some knowing " jars in the special manner characteristic of a philosopher's error, as also does Father Lonergan's query " Am I a knower ? " (p. 328). If instead we ask " Are sentences starting 'I know . . .' ever true ? ", -these " activities of knowing " become redundant, and the question of what is their " structure " does not arise. T. R.
