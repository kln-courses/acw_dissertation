<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction A major objective of the current Copan Archaeological Project, under the direction of William T. Sanders and David Webster, is the excavation and reconstruction of a series of architectural complexes on several levels of size and complexity.l The subject of this report is our recent work in a major "palace" complex during the 1980-1981 field season. Although Copan has been the focus of a great deal of archaeological research for more than a century, most of the excavation, mapping, and reconstruction has cen- tered on the Main Group the massive cluster of large buildings, huge courtyards, and monumental sculpture so familiar to tourists, which forms the core of the Copan settlement system. As a result of recent work during earlier phases of the Copan Project led by Gordon Willey and Claude Baudez, we know that the whole Copan pocket the valley floor and foothills immediately around the Main Group was densely settled; approximately 3,400 visible structures have been mapped in this area alone .2 1. The material for this report is drawn in part from the Annual Report 1981 by the project director, William T. Sanders, to the Instituto Hondureno de Antropologia e Historia and from the final report on the excavation and architecture of CV36, Courtyard A, by David Webster, William Fash, and Elliot Abrams, as part of the Copan Archaeological Project, Phase 2, 1981-1984. 2. Gordon Willey and Richard Leventhal, ''Prehistoric Settlement at The new Copan surveys have shown that the Main Group is flanked by two major concentrations of settle- ment.3 Just to the SE iS a dense cluster of several hundred mounds known as the Bosque. To the NE, extending to a distance of about 1 km., is a similar concentration called Sepultura, connected to the Main Group by a long causeway. Both are characterized by numerous courtyard groups with elaborate masonry structures. Although some religious or civic structures are clearly present (e.g., a ballcourt in the Bosque), we believe that both areas were primarily residential in function. Current excavations are being carried out in the Sepultura zone with the objective of excavating and restoring a representative sample of Maya residential complexes, from the simplest to the most complex. During their mapping project, Willey and his col- leagues devised a preliminary quadripartite classification of mound sites based primanly upon numbers of mounds, mound size, and, to a lesser extent, qualitative markers such as the presence of cut stone and sculpture.4 Type 1 Copan," in Norman Hammond and Gordon Willey, eds., Maya Ar- chaeology and Ethnohistory (University of Texas Press: Austin 1979); Claude Baudez, ed., Copan Vol. 2 (Central American Bank, in press). 3.

An Elite Compound at Copan, Honduras David Webster Elliot M. Abrams The Pennsylvania State University University Park, Pennsylvania Although the Lowland Maya site of Copan, in western Honduras, has been the focus of archaeological research for a century, most excavations have been centered on the ruins of the Main Group. A major objective of the cur- rent Copan Archaeological Project is the complete excavation of a series of archaeological complexes in the densely settled Sepultura residential zone NE of the Main Group. In 1980-1981 an impressive compound, Plaza A, was largely exposed. Excavation data indicate that this major architectural com- plex functioned as an elite residential zone, but had important political and possible ritualfunctions as well. In addition to well-preserved architecture, data from Plaza A include features consistent with domestic functions and a corpus of new sculpture, most notably a beautiful hieroglyphic bench from the main structure.</page><page sequence="2">286 An Elite Compound at Copan, HonduraslWebster and Abrams struction phase of Plaza A, from about 750-800 A.C., even though trenching of mounds and plaza reveals in- termittent occupations going back at least to the Middle Preclassic (1000-300 B.C.). Description of Site CV36 and Plaza A CV36 is located at the extreme NE end of the Sepultura zone about 640 m. NE of the Main Group. It is within 50 m. of the Copan River, which here takes a curve to the sw. The site is situated on the first low terrace and overlooks a fertile area of rich alluvial soil. The group consists of at least 45 mapped structures (more are com- ing to light as a result of excavation) in an area of about 6 ha. (FIG. 1). Mounds range in height from less than 1 m. to more than 4 m. Characteristic of Type 4 sites is the presence of multiple courtyard groups and in CV36 there are at least six of these, along with scattered out- lying mounds. We began excavations in Plaza A at the southern end of the site because the structures were larg- est here, and we assumed that this reflected a high degree of energy expenditure consistent with the high social sta- tus of its occupants. Site CV36 like the rest of the Se- pultura zone, had experienced relatively little disturbance from looters or from cultivation. Fortunately the density of masonry buildings is so high that the land cannot be plowed. It is, however, cleared for pasture, facilitating surface mapping. Plaza A consists of a large, level plaza delineated on four sides by masonry structures (FIG. 2). On the west and south are the conjoined structures (=Str.) 81 and 82. Str. 82 is the largest building in CV36, standing to a height of 3.5-4 m. above the plaza before excavation and with a length of about 50 m. The flanking Str. 81 is lower (about 2 m.) and quite broad, since it has a series of rear terraces extending down to a lower plaza to the west. Its length was ca. 23 m. Along the eastern edge of the plaza is Str. 83, a high (ca. 3 m.) rectangular mound ca. 17 m. long and 9 m. wide. It too is connected at its sw corner to Str. 82. These three buildings thus form a U-shaped architectural complex open to the north. All of these substructures had visible alignments of cut stone on their summits and were spacious enough to have supported multi-roomed superstructures, thus consistent in form with our hypothesized residential functions. Str. 80 delineates the north side of the plaza but does not connect with adjacent buildings, so principal access to the plaza probably was through the openings to the west and east of this building. This is the smallest build- ing on the plaza (ca. 16 m. x 10 m. in its unexcavated state) although it is quite high (ca. 2.5 m.). From its size and position we suspected that it might be a shrine. The overall configuration of the plaza is not very regular. e &gt;+ ' t-vX' / \ \ - / \ // / // // 0 25m Figure 1. Site CV36, Copan, Honduras. sites the simplest of all, usually consist of several low mounds grouped around a single plaza. Higher-order Type 2 and 3 sites are larger and more complex, and the hi- erarchy culminates with Type 4 sites: large groups with numerous mounds of impressive size, high-quality con- struction, and elaborate decoration. These are, as Willey and his colleagues point out, what Maya archaeologists usually call something like "ceremonial centers", but given their proximity to other sites and to the Main Group at Copan, a more likely interpretation is that they are residential complexes for powerful Maya families with attached retainers and minor family members.S In order to test this proposition, we have begun excavations at site CV36, the major Type 4 site in the Sepultura zone. After two seasons of work, we have wholly or partially excavated five of the CV36 courtyard groups, and the entire site will be excavated and completely restored after two more years. This report specifically concerns our work in Plaza A, the largest of the CV36 courtyard groups, which was almost entirely excavated during the 1980-1981 field season. Processing of artifacts and burials is now underway, so the report focuses mainly on the architectural and sculptural features associated with the plaza group. We will also confine ourselves to the final, Late Classic con- 5.

If a similar screen closed the other gap, most traces of it are now gone. The courtyard is constructed of a basal sub-flooring of large, relatively flat river cobbles, as is usual at Co- pan. These support a thin layer of grouting, mainly chips of green tuff, possibly the remains of stone-cutting ac- tivity. The grouting in turn seems to have served as the base for a final layer of plaster a few cm. thick. Because the courtyard was not very deeply buried (the cobbles were generally 10-20 cm. below the surface), little re- mains of the grouting or plaster in most areas. Intact plaster was generally found only along the edges of the structures where it was to some extent protected by col- lapse debris. It is possible that the whole plaza surface was originally plastered, but there is only indirect evi- dence for this. An activity area was found directly on the courtyard surface in froIlt of Str. 83 (see FIG. 2). This was a midden- like deposit about 2 m. wide consisting of dense accu- mulations of utilitarian ceramics, manos, metates, obsidian blades, and other artifacts. This appears to be a primary midden, most likely marking a food prepara- tion area. The oIlly other features found associated with the plaza were two small cylindrical altars -one in front of Str. 80 and the other in front of Str. 83. Structure 82 The Architecture Since it was clearly the dominant building on Plaza A, we next turned our attention to Str. 82, and managed to clear most of it after two months of work. We use the word ;'clear" instead of i'excavate" because the archi- tectural features of this building, like those of the rest of Plaza A and indeed most of CV36, are so well pre- served that in essence one simply peels off the collapse debris from the underlying terraces, stairways and room walls. Much of the elite or civic architecture at Copan is built of fine cut-stone masonry, mainly of green vol- canic tuffS which proves so durable that usually only the upper sections of the superstructures are affected by col- lapse (FIGF 3). The final phase of construction of Str. 82 may be broken down, for pulposes of description, into three ma- jor components. Two of these are basically structural: the substructure, or basal platform, and the superstruc- ture room complexes (FIG. 2). The third consists of dec- orative sculptural elementss most of which fell from the superstructure fagades, and also a major sculptural mon- ; w 3 C27 ip9 = i t __ O £ 1CD ° 2 D l_ _ p r - r I n |F- J S S S S S t : _ _ . J _ Figure 2. Courtyard AS Site CV36. Buildings have somewhat different alignments, all a few degrees east of north, and Strs. 81 and 83 meet Str. 82 at rather different angles, producing a distinctly irregular plaza shape. The whole Plaza A complex, as well as parts of adjacent plaza groups, sits on a large artificial platform, but we have not yet worked out the size of this construction or its phasing. David Webster and Elliot Abrams of the Pennsylvania State University supervised the excavation of the latest levels of the plaza, Strs. 8O, 81, and 82, and part of Str. 83. William Fash of Harvard University later finished Str. 83 (and also supervised deep soundings in the plaza which produced spectacular results that will be presented elsewhere). William L. Fash and the project restorer, Rudi Larios V., cleared the rear slope of Str. 82 during the summer of 1982, providing invaluable evidence for the reconstruction of the building. The Plaza The plaza, measured from the central point of the basal course of each of the structures, is 30.39 m. long and 22.8 m. wide, thus having an area of about 693 sq. m. As we have seen, the plaza has only two openings -one to the east and one to the west of Str. 80. We found evidence of some sort of plaza edging or delineation across the western gap in the form of disturbed align- ments of very large, well-cut masonry blocks some more than 1 m. long. These apparently connected Strs. 81 and 80 and possibly served as the base for some sort of perishable divider or screen. We could find no trace of plaza surface to the north or east of this disturbed alignment, although it was obvious on the south and west. Midden material was dense off the north end of</page><page sequence="4">288 An Elite Compound at Copan, HonduraslWebster and Abrams found several vault stones, but not enough to definitely indicate the presence of a vault; since we also recovered very large pieces of roofing plaster, we assumed the building had a beam and mortar roof. When Fash and Larios cleared the rear slope of the mound, they discov- ered many vault stones apparently the whole upper part of the building had collapsed right off the summit of the mound. The east superstructure, then, was vaulted. Fash and Larios also found a seam in the masonry of the rear retaining wall of Str. 82 at roughly the line of the cor- ridor between the east and central superstructures. This may indicate that the whole eastern segment of Str. 82 is a late addition. No vault stones were fallen from the west superstructure nor were large pieces of roofing plas- ter found, so we surmise that the roof was thatched. Originally the two end superstructures were separated from the central superstructure by narrow corridors. The wide (3.5 m.) western corridor was later turned into two small rooms (3 and 10) by the addition of small pro- jecting walls of rather inferior construction. The small Room 3 has a side bench and four niches in the interior walls-the only niches found intact in the superstructure rooms. The central superstructure dominates the Str. 82 com- plex, not only by its central position, but also by its larger size, finer construction, and, as we shall see later, its elaborate sculptured fagades. It consists of three rooms. Two side rooms (5 and 6) contain large benches and were entered through side doors opening into the corridors (note how the door of Room 6 has been partially and clumsily blocked by one of the later walls of Rooms 3 and 10). Room S was provided with a second doorway communicating with the central room of the building, and so seems to have had a closer functional relationship with that room than Room 6. At some point this second doorway was blocked off by large, plastered stone slabs. Room 1, the central room, is the largest of the three and was entered by a central doorway over 2 m. wide which faces out on the stairway and commands the plaza as a whole. Here again we found a large bench, fully 6 m. long and 2.3 m. wide. Throughout the rest of the Str. 82 complex the numerous benches, though plastered and in some cases painted red, were without decoration. The Room 1 bench, by contrast, is a massive carved monu- ment one of the most elaborate found at Copan (see description below). Clearly important elite functions were carried out in Room 1 which were different from those elsewhere in Plaza A. In general, the masonry of the central superstructure was superior to that of the flanking buildings. Walls were also more massive and well preserved, and the collapse debris was filled with beveled vault stones. No sections of the vault-spring were still intact, but since sections of Figure 3. Structure 82 during excavation, looking sw; Room 1 in left-center of picture. ument in the form of a massive hieroglyphic bench from the central room. The basal platform is 46 m. long and 10 m. wide. Along the entire north side of the substructure runs a well-preserved stone stairway just over 30 m. long. Five stairs provide access to a front terrace 2-2.5 m. wide on the summit. Both stairway and terrace were covered with plaster as were, apparently, all the building surfaces in Plaza A. Three separate masonry superstructures were erected on top of the basal platform, and these are designated by their respective positions as the east, central, and west superstructures. Architectural features, particularly along the fronts of the buildings, were well preserved, with some wall segments as high as 2 m. Unfortunately, the rear walls of all the superstructures had collapsed. Such collapse is common at Copan where rear room walls rise almost in the same plane as the rear platform walls, thus making them very vulnerable to collapse. In addition, the end walls of the east and west superstructures had also fallen. Enough remained, however, so that we could reconstruct original wall positions. Both the east and west superstructures have similar plans, although the latter is the larger and better built. Both have two rooms and are entered by doors facing onto the front terrace, and all rooms are characterized by commodious rear and side benches which occupy much of the interior space. Some rooms show signs of modi- fication; e.g., in Room 2 of the west superstructure the rear bench was divided by a masonry wall. Walls of both superstructures are heavy masonry, ca. 0.8-1 m. wide. During the initial clearing of the east superstructure we</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field ArchaeologylVol. 10, 1983 289  Figure 4. Drawing of hieroglyphic bench in Structure 82. the interior walls were still standing to over 2 m., it must have been higher than that. Fash and Larios recovered large drain stones from the rear collapse debris which presumably fell from the roof. The Hieroglyphic Bench The most spectacular find in Plaza A is the Room 1 bench (FIGS. 4-6). We had anticipated the discovery of such a bench since Leventhal had previously unearthed one in a nearby Type 3 site (CV43).6 We had formed the hypothesis that these served as "thrones'' or elite status symbols for high-ranking members of Copan so- ciety as well as more mundane domestic functions. Unlike the CV43 bench, which is badly eroded, the Room 1 bench is almost perfectly preserved except for some blocks unaccountably missing from its western end. The intricate carving is as crisp today as when it was first executed, greatly facilitating interpretation. Three sets of elements make up the bench. A set of six large stones carved with human figures supports the bench from below. The main element is a set of huge tuff slabs. Finally, a set of raised plinths adorned with gesturing human figures was found, one at each end. The whole bench surface was covered with a plaster capping 7 cm. thick, and all of the carving was coated with an ex- tremely thin wash of robin's-egg-blue plaster. Because of their complexity, our interpretations of the iconography and epigraphy of the bench are still prelim- inary and cannot be discussed at length here. What fol- lows is a provisional, thumbnail sketch, primarily derived from the interpretations of Claude Baudez and Berthold Riese.7 The main horizontal element of the bench shows the 6. Op. cit.

The body of the monster, or serpent, stretches across the fronts of the horizontal slabs and incorporates an inscription of 16 full-figure glyphs. Six anthropomorphic figures support the bench. The two central figures hold lancets associated with auto- sacrifice and the others may represent the four bacabs who, in Maya cosmology, were thought to support the sky. Meanings associated with the two large figures seated on the heads of the Sky Monster are difficult to work out, but they too may be associated with autosacrifice.

Hieroglyphic bench as seen from eastern end of Room 1, Str. 82.</page><page sequence="6">290 An Elite Compound at Copan, HonduraslWebster and Abrams Fafade Sculpture The central superstructure of Str. 82 was the only building in the entire group, and probably in the entire CV36, to be heavily decorated with stone sculpture. We recovered 161 pieces of sculpture from the terrace, steps, and plaza in front of the building, and a smaller amount from the lateral rooms and corridors. Fash and Larios recovered many other pieces of fallen sculpture from their excavations in 1982 in the rear of the building, so we conclude that the south facJade was sculptured as well. All of the sculptural elements recovered in 1981, ex- cept for decorative bands forming the bases of two wall niches on either side of the central doorway, were fallen and scattered, clearly from the upper fac,ade of the cen- tral superstructure. Reconstruction of the original motifs and compositions is difficult, not only because the sculp- ture has fallen, but also because it is, in typical Copan fashion, composite sculpture (i.e., designs are made up of small carved individual blocks which are assembled into a unified composition). To further complicate mat- ters, looters have carried off some pieces. Despite these difficulties, we can suggest the general nature of the facJade decoration from several lines of evidence: the positions of the fallen (and few in-place) pieces, the various design elements, and comparisons with buildings elsewhere at Copan, especially the re- cently reconstructed Temple 18 and the so-called Temple of Meditation (Str. 22) in the Main Group.9 The latter, despite its name, is probably another palace structure similar in function to Str. 82, but on a grander scale. Clusters of fallen stone show that most of the sculpture came from either side of the central doorway of Room 1, and probably from above it as well. Design elements can be classified into four categories: 1) parts of human bodies carved in the round and virtually life-size; 2) parts of stylized serpent heads, along with feather motifs mak- ing up the serpents' bodies; 3) parts of two composite deity or monster heads; and 4) decorative elements form- ing the bases of niches into which some of the sculpture was set. Many individual pieces have projecting tenons for setting them into the wall masonry. Our only firm clue to the original positions of this sculpture from the front facJade are the bases of a set of niches on either side of the front doorway. Each niche appears to have held at least one human figure carved in the round. All the other sculpture fell from higher up on the building. An interesting sidelight here is that one of the niche figures held a paint pot in his hand. Abrams, in his trenches through the front terrace of Str. 82, recovered 9. Aubrey S.

Other glyphs include one referring to "house", to a title "calendar priest", to "second change or succes- sion", to Madrugada (the last king of Copan), to Copan as a place, and to some sort of relationship. Major sculptural monuments, except for the well- known stelae, are rare in the outlying parts of the settle- ment in the valley, and the presence of one in Plaza A reinforces our supposition that this group was a major elite establishment. Another Copan monument, Altar W', which now sits in the Copan Museum, was found in place by S . G . Morley .8 Although his description is vague, it is almost certain that this monument was found in the CV36 group and, from details of his sketchy report plus our own testing of five of the plazas, Plaza A seems the most likely original site. If true, the presence of a second great monument in the plaza would suggest that its occupants were of extremely exalted status, probably members of a social stratum just below that of the kingly lineage of Copan, or even marginal members of it (this may be what is referred to by the relationship glyph in the bench inscription). 8.

Preliminary reconstruction of the Str. 82 complex looking sw. a full-sized, seated human figure with writing imple- ments which had been purposefully buried when the last stage of construction took place on the western section of Str. 82, burying an older building. Fash and Larios will present the final reconstruction of the upper portions of Str. 82 based on their 1982 excavations along the rear of the building. All that can be said at this point is that the total height of the central superstructure was about 7 m. and that two wide cornices formed a panel around the top of the building which probably bordered much of the sculpture. Room 9 Room 9 is unusual in that it is built not on top of the substructure but rather directly into its eastern end on a lower level (it projects below Room 8). Room 9 is very small-only 3.71 sq. m.-much smaller than the other rooms of the building. Its east and west walls supported a vault, which was necessary because of the weight of the overlying room. Just to the NE of Room 9 is a tamped earth surface in the angle made by the junction of Strs. 82 and 83, and reached from the plaza by a narrow stairway. On the tamped earth surface were several whole utilitarian vessels as well as lithic, shell, bone, and other ceramic artifacts. All this seems to be primary midden material indicating food preparation. There are traces of stone platforms in this area that have not yet been ex- cavated, and in all likelihood we will find other indica- tions of domestic activities as well. Although Room 9 had features consistent with domestic use (e.g., a bench), it is too small to have provided residential space for more than a single individual. It is tempting to interpret Room 9 as living space for someone engaged in food prepa- ration or other work in the nearby activity area. The problem with this idea is that Room 9 seems very elab- orate for a low-status residence. Although its exact func- tion cannot be specified, it must have had something to do with the nearby activity area. Apart from the bench, the only interior features of the room were a set of wall niches. Although room and bench surfaces were well pre- served in Str. 82 in general and were carefully cleared, no in situ features were found upon them, apart from an obviously very late adult burial placed in Room 1 after it had begun to deteriorate, and the features of the Room 9 area. Collapse debris included large quantities of Late Classic Coner phase ceramics as well as earlier sherds. Figure 7 gives some idea of what the whole Str. 82 complex originally looked like. Structure 81 Str. 81 is connected on the south to Str. 82 and also relates to the adjacent, lower plaza group to the west (FIG. 1), although its main orientation is toward Plaza A. Even before excavation it was clear that there were two parts to the mound. At the northern end was a high sec- tion (ca. 2.3 m. above the plaza level) while the southern section was lower and flatter. Superstructure debris was less abundant on Str. 81, as were cut stone and visible stone alignments; all of these were most obvious on the northern, raised section of the mound. Our original working hypothesis was that Str. 81 was of secondary importance in the overall courtyard group-perhaps the house of a retainer or low-ranking relative. Exposure of the eastern side of the substructure re- vealed a 15 m. long stairway similar in construction to that of Str. 82 and contiguous with it at the sw corner of the plaza (FIG. 2). An unusual feature of this stairway was that it did not run the whole length of the building, but stopped 4 m. short. The reason became clear when we found a definite seam indicating two construction episodes. During the first episode, the stairway was only 5.28 m. wide and was centered on the doorway of Room 1 of the superstructure. Later the southern section was added to provide access to the low terrace to the south of the superstructure, but no addition was made on the north since there was no terrace there. In its final phase, the stairway had five steps leading up to the general terrace level. Both stairs and terrace were plastered. A single building (measuring 10.7 m . x 6 m. ) crowned the northern end of the substructure. Eastern and southern walls were in good condition, although pre- served to a height only of 60-70 cm. The northern wall was almost entirely slumped away, although enough re- mained to fix its position. None of the rear wall courses was still intact, but since we know the position of the rear terraces (see below), we can roughly reconstruct its . . posltlon.</page><page sequence="8">292 An Elite Compound at Copan, HonduraslWebster and Abrams Although the superstructure was quite large, its ma- sonry was of inferior quality. Cut stone was present, but predominantly in basal courses or around door jambs and corners. Hrom the amount of masonry found, it was clear that the upper portions of the walls were originally com- posed of perishable materials, as are some modern Maya structures. I0 Collapse debris and material from just above the floor included small fragments of charcoal and burned adobe as well as burned remains of small posts or poles, thus reinforcing the idea of a partially perishable super- struc--hn and suggesting that it had burned down. No vault stones or heavy plaster debris were found, so the roof was probably thatch. Our excavations exposed a large room with a low rear bench facing a wide doorway opening onto the plaza. At the north end of the structure there are what seem to be little dividing walls creating a second, smaller room, which might have had its own corner bench (this feature was very fragmentary). A well-preserved yellowish-white plaster floor covered the interior of the superstructure. On the basis of the architecture alone, we would have felt that our original hypothesis about the function of Str. 81 was supported, but several additional discoveries complicate the picture. The first is two tenoned sculp- tures found on the front terrace, where they had ob- viously fallen from their original positions on either side of the doorway. These are among the most impressive individual pieces of sculpture found in Plaza A. Each represents a jaguar head with a bat headdress. Also, un- like the other rooms in the complex, several features were found on the floor of the Str. 81 superstructure. One was a large olla near the southern wall. A second vessel was an incensario, painted and modeled with a mustachioed human face, found near the possible door- way into the little northern room. Even more surprising were several pieces of ball-game paraphernalia found in the northern half of the room (FIG. 8). These included a complete yoke; a broken hacha (a thin, elaborately carved stone) in the form of a macaw head; a second, complete hacha in the form of a stylized death's head; and several fragments of another yoke. These all appear to have fallen on the floor as the building burned, and presumably had been stored high up on the walls or in the rafters. Al- though such paraphernalia have been found in the Maya Lowlands, they have not, to our knowledge, been found in direct association with living surfaces. Certainly their presence, along with the jaguar sculptures, suggests that the building was not, as we had originally supposed, the residence of a retainer or other low-status member of the Plaza A household. Perhaps this structure housed a high- status member of that household whose role included the 1 590 15 R6 - i 59010 ' ' ' b. R 5 s . . . . . . . - so *_, 0 11T l s S Figure 8.

To the south of the superstructure was a large flat area-essentially an extension of the front terrace which seems not to have had an associated building, at least none of a substantial, permanent nature. The flat area was surfaced with cobbles (much like the cobbles used in plaza construction) and we recognized that it was spa- cious enough, and close enough to the various room complexes, to have been a convenient space for outdoor activities such as food preparation. This idea became more plausible when we discovered dense sherd accu- mulations up against the outside south wall of the su- perstructure. At the south end of the open area, where it adjoined the Str. 82 terrace, was a masonry construc- tion. Although highly disturbed, what remained of this feature suggested the presence of two box-like arrange- ments which would have made good hearths. Although obvious signs of burning were not found associated with this feature, there were unusually dense concentrations of ceramics, ground stone (including celts), and obsidian here. We assume that a range of activities associated with the domestic use of the Plaza A compound were carried out on this flat section of Str. 81, either in the open or under light, perishable, ramada-like structures which would have left no traces on the cobble floor. As noted previously, the rear (west) side of Str. 81 relates to a second, lower plaza group, although the main orientation of the structure was clearly toward Plaza A. This rear side, though badly preserved, consisted of two cobble terraces extending the entire length of the sub- structure. The upper terrace was 4.6 m. wide and 1 m. high, and the lower one was 1.4 m. wide and 0.9 m. high. Situated at the southern end of the upper terrace 10.

This had a floor area of only 5.56 sq. m. and was furnished with a narrow rear bench. Walls were of dressed green tuff, and the lack of any associated vault stones or heavy plaster fragments sug- gests it had a thatched roof. We found no signs of plaster on the walls or floors. Large quantities of utilitarian pot- tery were found in association with Room 2, though there were no whole vessels broken on the floor as in Room 1. The size, location, and associated artifacts recall Room 9 of Str. 82. Both are in close proximity to what is probably primary midden material indicating a food pro- cessing area. If Room 2 was used for food preparation or storage, or housed a retainer or servant, access to the top of the platform must have been by way of some sort of perishable steps, such as a notched log, since we found no sign of a stone stairway. Structure 83 Structure 83 is the second largest building of the group and bounds the plaza on its eastern side (FIG. 9). It was mainly dug by William Fash and what follows is taken from his section of the preliminary report on the CV36 site. Because of its similarity in size and shape to Str. 82, our working hypothesis prior to and during the excava- tion of Str. 83 was that the building was primarily res- idential in function. We further felt that if this hypothesis was correct, the inhabitants of Str. 83 were probably of somewhat lower status than those of Str. 82, since there was no sign of vault stones or large amounts of sculpture, and because Str. 83 was somewhat smaller. Substructure masonry was comparable in quality to Str. 82. A stairway with five risers, joined to that of Str. 82 at the SE corner of the plaza, runs along the entire length of the substructure. A small cylindrical stone altar lay at the base of the stairway at the level of the plaza. The upper risers of the stairway had fallen, and relatively few were recovered from the collapse rubble, suggesting that they had been robbed for use elsewhere. At the top of the stairway, 1.95 m. above the plaza level, was a terrace 2.2 m. wide in front of the superstructure. The superstructure measures 18.1 m. long x 5.7 m. wide and was built of green tuff masonry comparable in quality to that of Str. 82. We found no vault stones or large plaster slabs associated with the superstructure and so the roof was probably thatched. The three main rooms of the superstructure have doors opening on the court- yard. All have very large rear benches (averaging ca. 9.3 sq. m. in area) as well as very narrow side "benches", which are really more like narrow ledges. No features were found in the rooms except round burn-marks on the floors, which may indicate the use of braziers for warmth. Room interiors were well plastered and the plas- ter of the bench surfaces was especially well preserved. In some places, traces of red paint could still be seen on the plaster surfaces. Although the front walls of the superstructure were preserved to a maximum height of well over a meter, we found very few indications of facoade decoration. On either side of the central doorway were five identical T- shaped stone blocks aligned horizontally. These may represent the glyph for germination, and suggest that the central room was of particular importance or had a spe- cial function. On the north and south ends of the superstructure are small rooms whose doorways must have faced in these respective directions, although it is difficult to recon- struct the rooms in detail since both are badly collapsed. The north room, which originally measured only ca. 6 sq. m. in area, was at some point divided into two even smaller rooms by a transverse wall. Both rooms would have been rather awkward to get to, especially the south- ern one which can be approached only by a narrow ledge. Despite their awkward positions, both rooms were in- tegral parts of the original design of the superstructure. Their small size and difficult access suggest they were not living quarters. Structure 80 Str. 80 defines the northern side of Plaza A and is physically unattached to the other three structures. Be- cause of its small size, limited summit area, relative isolation, and its position between Plaza A and the group of structures to the north, we guessed it might have func- tioned as a shrine. Excavation quickly revealed that Str. 80 had suffered to an unusual degree from stone-robbing. Although much of the structure was originally built of cut stone, only the basal courses of the substructure and the stairway were still in place. Still, enough remained Figure 9.

It originally measured 16 m. x 8. 15 m. and had a stair- way of six steps which led to the top of the mound, ca. 2.4 m. above plaza level. This stairway did not run all along the front of the mound, but was centered and slightly outset. In front of the stairway on the plaza sur- face was a small altar virtually identical to that in front of Str. 83. The superstructure was very poorly preserved and its reconstruction is educated conjecture, at best. There ap- pears to have been only a single large room about 10 m. long and 4.6 m. wide with a narrow (0.47 m.) terrace in front of it. Collapse debris was very shallow and in- cluded very little well-cut stone, suggesting a crude stone foundation which supported upper walls of perishable materials, perhaps wattle and daub. Whatever their con- stuction, the upper walls were certainly flimsy and could have supported nothing heavier than a thatched roof. We found the basal fragments of what appears to be a rear bench, and another possible bench-like configuration in the sw corner. The only signs of decoration were several small pieces of stone carved with spiral motifs; these were from the collapse debris on the front slope of the building and probably originally were parts of a com- posite sculptural group which flanked the central door- way at the top of the stairs. None of our finds in the Str. 80 excavation definitely supported our hypothesis that the building was a shrine. Only one of the criteria for shrines at Tikal is met by Str. 80 (the presence of a front altar), and this in itself is far from conclusive since Str. 83, which is rather clearly a residence, also has one. 11 Although we excavated a 2- m. trench through the center of the mound, we found no central burial inside. And such a burial is one feature that might expectably be associated with a special shrine building in a society with a strong orientation toward ancestor worship. One associated feature of note was a dense concentra- tion of midden material beneath the collapse rubble along the east side of the mound and on the adjacent plaza surface. This deposit probably related to that found in front of Str. 837 which was apparently primary midden. Conclusions Our original assumption that the CV36 site was an elite residential zone and that Plaza A was the most com- plex and highest-ranking unit of that zone has been largely supported by several lines of evidence. The first is the 11. Marshall Becker, "The Identification of a Second Plaza Plan at Tikal, Guatemala, and its Implications for Ancient Maya Social Com- plexity," unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania (1971). architecture itself. Buildings are large, generally of ex- cellent construction, and clearly required sizable expen- ditures of energy to build. Our testing elsewhere in CV36 has revealed no other groups with buildings the size and quality of Str. 82. The Plaza A architecture most closely resembles the impressive groups in the so-called Ce- menterios zone just south of the Main Group, which seem to have been elaborate households physically at- tached to the central establishments of the rulers of Co- pan. Rooms in Plaza A are spacious and well provided with the large benches that seem to have served a variety of purposes in Maya society, including sleeping. Many of these rooms, for example the lateral rooms in Str. 82 and the central rooms in Str. 83, may have been for residential use only while others, such as the complex of rooms in the central superstructure of Str. 82, may have had political and religious functions as well. The elaborate hieroglyphic bench clearly points in this direc- tion. Our working model is that the central superstructure was the residence of the most exalted member of the CV36 group (perhaps a member of the royal Copan li- neage, or at least an important courtier), who used it for a variety of purposes: administrative and ritual, as well as residential. Rooms 5 and 6 may have housed principal wives, while the flanking superstructures housed sec- ondary wives and concubines of a polygynous household (the model of a polygynous elite is based on various ethnohistorical sourcesl2). Additions and modifications to rooms during the last phase are consistent with the notion of a growing residential unit. Following this line of thought further, we suggest that Str. 83 housed a closely related elite family, possibly of the same lineage. A major aim of our structural and plaza excavations is the recovery of large burial samples from each group. We hope that demographic structure of the burial pop- ulations, modes of burial, and inforrnation on skeletal nutrition and pathology will eventually provide indepen- dent evidence supporting this kinship model of Maya society and settlement. As an aside to these architectural interpretations, we would like to interject a note of caution. While the idea that high-status groups control more energy than low- status ones, and that this differential access to energy is partly expressed in larger and more elaborate households for the elite, is commonplace among archaeologists, and largely borne out by the ethnographic record, this gen- eralization will be expressed differently in different so- cieties. Our experience from the Sepultura excavations indicates that energetic differentials are not strongly ex- 12. Ralph L.

The dominant Sepultura elite appear to have occupied rooms only mar- ginally larger, if larger at all, than those found in "lower class" housing (begging for the moment the question of per capita floor space for people of various social ranks). In Sepultura the energetic differentials are most strongly expressed in the height of the substructure, the quality of the masonry and plaster, the design of the buildings (especially roofing), the amount of sculptural ornamen- tation, and the presence of politically/ritually significant artifacts and monuments. The association of elaborate sculptural decoration with the central superstructure of Str. 82 reinforces our impression of the importance of the building and its oc- cupants. Although traces of sculpture were found in all the buildings, none were as elaborately decorated as Str. 82. On the basis of our excavations in other plaza groups, this generalization appears to apply to CV36 as a whole. The hieroglyphic bench provides unique historical infor- mation concerning the status of a major figure possibly a lineage head who resided in Plaza A, and if Altar Wt was originally found there it would further magnify the importance of the group. One possible interpretation of the Plaza A complex, given our excavation data and the inscription on the bench, is as follows. Plaza A, and Str. 82 in particular, was the establishment of an important Maya official with the title "Calendar Priest". He lived in the earlier struc- ture that Abrams found under the western part of the Str. 82 platform. At some point during the reign of Madru- gada, either this individual received a "promotion", or, more likely, was succeeded by a relative (son?). Baudez notes that the plinth figures may show the juxtaposition of an old individual (on the west) associated with death and ancestor symbols, and a young individual on the other end, consistent with the idea of succession.l3 In any case, the new status also carried the title "Calendar Priest", but seems to have given its holder more prestige and access to labor than available earlier, perhaps be- cause of his relationship to the great builder-king, Mad- rugada. The earlier building was covered up, and a scribe sculpture buried during the renovation, perhaps ritually "killed" by the separate burial of head and body. New superstructures were raised on the platform and the cen- tral one was decorated with elaborate sculpture, some of which continues the scribe theme foreshadowed in the buried statue. The bench itself celebrates the accession of the "Calendar Priest" and was a major symbol of his role as an important courtier. That this interpretation is highly speculative goes with- out saying, and the authors hasten to point out that it is theirs alone and should not be imputed to other members of the Copan project. Strs. 80 and 81 are difficult to analyze in terms of their functions. Since Str. 80 was so badly disturbed we cannot offer any convincing support for our idea that it was a shrine except its configuration and, negatively, the lack of an obvious shrine elsewhere. That is, if one as- sumes that an essential component of all Maya court- yards was a shrine, then Str. 80 must have been it, a dubious argument at best. Str. 81, despite its less impressive construction, did not turn out to be the lower-status residence we expected. Its spacious room and bench, the discovery of elaborate jaguar sculptures, a finely made incensario, and espe- cially the ball-game paraphernalia seem to indicate the residence of a high-status individual, perhaps serving some specialized function for the group. Although it is not necessarily expected in an elite res- idential zone, midden debris, including dense concentra- tions of pottery and some ground stone, turned up in several contexts, most notably on the plaza in front of Str. 83, at the base of the stairs near ltoom 9, on the open terrace on the south section of Str. 81, and just east of Str. 80. Utilitarian ceramics (principally the ubiqui- tous Late Classic Casaca Striated Ware) predominated, but polychrome wares were also abundant. These artifact concentrations indicate that food processing, consump- tion, and disposal were being carried out in Plaza A, again consistent with its supposed residential functions. Although our ceramic studies of the CV36 site as a whole are not yet completed, it is our impression that elaborate imported polychrome vessels from the Ulua Valley are more numerous in Plaza A than elsewhere. Many of the domestic tasks undertaken by the inhab- itants of Plaza A may not have been carried out in the areas so far excavated. A series of low platforms is found behind Str. 82 and when these are cleared, we expect more activity areas to show up. In summary, the evidence at hand supports our idea that Plaza A was an elite residence-the chief one in the larger CV36 zone as a whole. Certainly not all the fea- tures of the group can be directly related to residence functions, but if Maya society was structured as a hier- archy of ranked households, we would expect numerous special political, social, and religious functions to accrlle to those households uppermost in the hierarchy. Cer- tainly this seems to be the pattern for some historically known Mesoamerican groups, such as the Quiche of the Guatemalan highlands. For the Quiche ethnohistoric evi- dence not only demonstrates well-developed ranking or 13. Op. cit.

The nearby site CV68 at the end of the causeway is of very different configuration from CV36 and probably holds surprises for us in the future.
