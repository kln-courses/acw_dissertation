<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews His Glassy Essence: An Autobiography of Charles Sanders Peirce Kenneth Laine Ketner Nashville and London: Vanderbilt University Press, 1998 xiii + 416 pp. Charles Peirce died in the spring of 1914. The first full-length biography, my own, did not appear until almost eighty years later in the spring of 1993. l The first volume of the second - projected for three volumes - by Kenneth Laine Ketner and under review here, ap- peared five years after that. It is, I think, important to be able to place in their historical context the reasons why one of the great and original thinkers of the 19th Century waited so long for well-researched bio- graphical studies, especially in light of the fact that there exists in many depositories a varied and very large number of primary sources on Peirce's life, of which the largest and most complete collection is at Harvard University's Houghton Library. For a detailed account, see my "The Singular Experience of the Peirce Biographer."2 Let it suf- fice here to point to the suspicions of the Harvard University depart- ment of philosophy concerning both Peirce's authenticity as a philoso- pher and his character. Their doubts about his character resulted in the department's withholding from research, with the exception of their designated biographer, all of Peirce's biographical papers until 1956 and of four "restricted" boxes until 1991. When in 1958, 1 began research into Peirce's life, I asked a num- ber of respected Harvard scholars about Peirce in an effort to find out why no biography had been written. At best, they said, Peirce was a brilliant and undisciplined thinker who created the kernel of great ideas that were fulfilled by others, such as William James and Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Winter, 1999, Vol. XXXV, No. 1</page><page sequence="2">178 Book Reviews Josiah Royce. He was, they said, a classic example of extraordinary talents gone tragically astray. His publications were minor and his philosophical ideas, such as they were, were already collected in six volumes of largely incomprehensible text, or else lost in the immense and impenetrable labyrinth of his manuscripts. Peirce was, they reported, an eccentric and debauched genius - a miscegenator, a homosexual, a bigamist, a drug addict and boozer, and a libertine who tried to seduce his first wife into sexual perver- sion, who married a French whore, and died of syphilis. My infor- mants believed that these accusations, which they assumed to be true, were the principal factors, along with its aversion to Peirce's philoso- phy, in the decision of the department not to proceed with his biog- raphy. My research in Peirce's papers has shown that some of these characterizations have a basis in evidence, others do not. There is nothing whatever to support the idea that the racist Peirce had a black mistress and mulatto children by her. But one of Peirce's Cen- tury Club cronies, the scientifically respected, but personally notori- ous geologist, Clarence King, did have and the two men may have been confused.3 Neither is there evidence to support the idea that Peirce was homosexual, but his brother, James Mills Peirce, dean of the graduate faculty, was (as were a fair number of their classmates) and, again, the two men may have been confused.4 The charge of bigamy has no serious basis. It is true, that at twenty, Peirce had seduced a young woman with the pretense of marriage, but that act was not bigamous. Melusina, his first wife, though she had many complaints about his behavior, never accused him of sexual perver- sion (or bigamy). No evidence exists supporting the claim that Juliette, his second wife, was a prostitute. To the contrary, what evidence there is supports the idea that she was a woman of independent means. Peirce's ability to think clearly until a very short time before his death belies the belief that he suffered from syphilis. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that Peirce abused drugs and alcohol begin- ning in his early twenties. I believe he used them to ameliorate the lifelong effects of two neurological pathologies, the exquisite pain of trigeminal neuralgia and the uncontrollable mood swings of manic-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 179 depressive illness; the symptoms of both he described in himself.5 That Peirce was a philanderer was believed by both his wives and by others. Hypersexuality, along with the other kinds of manic behavior exhibited by Peirce, is symptomatic of manic-depressives. The de- partment had, it seems, some basis for its attitude towards Peirce, but not for what Murphey accurately calls "the Harvard vendetta against Peirce from Eliot's ascension to the presidency of Harvard in 1869 until the advent of Putnam, Sheffler, and a new breed of Harvard professors."6 Nor is there justification for the sad state into which Peirce's manuscripts were allowed to decline.7 Originally, the Harvard department intended the Collected Pa- pers of Charles Sanders Peirce 8 to appear in ten volumes, with those beyond the first six devoted to philosophical writings expected to contain "writings on physics and psychology, as well as his reviews, letters and biography," but that project languished for almost twenty years.9 Slowly, Peirce's reputation as a philosopher grew. In 1939, the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Society devoted most of a meeting to his thought, the first such event. The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946, but owing to lack of funds did not begin publication of its Transactions until 1965. In 1952, at the suggestion of Arthur O. Lovejoy, the distinguished historian of ideas, the Peirce Society sponsored the first Studies in the Philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce, with an essay by him and twenty- three others on vari- ous aspects of Peirce's thought. 10 Two years later, partly in response to these events, the department invited Arthur Burks, with the aid of a Rockefeller Grant, to prepare the seventh and eighth volumes of the Collected Papers, which appeared in 1958. The department also asked him to undertake Peirce's biography, but he refused for rea- sons of professional choice. That Quine asked Burks at the time if he had uncovered any evidence of Peirce's bigamy (he had not) shows that the department still had reservations about the desirability of a biography. In 1959, forty-five years after Peirce's death, the depart- ment appointed Max Harold Fisch, a long-time Peirce scholar and established historian of philosophy, as its designated Peirce biogra- pher and provided him with a Rockefeller Grant. Fisch spent the</page><page sequence="4">180 Book Reviews next thirty years engaged in collecting a wide variety of Peirce mate- rials, but he never wrote the biography and effectively discouraged anyone else from doing so. In this painstaking and exacting search, he was assisted by many scholars, friends, and correspondents both in the United States and in Europe. Harvard's refusal to provide a permanent office or funding for Fisch's biographical work led, in 1974, to the circumstances whereby Fisch and his efforts, by this time in- cluding plans for a new chronological edition of Peirce's work as well as the biography, became associated with the Texas Tech University's Institute for Studies in Pragmaticism, whose director is Ketner, about as distant geographically and culturally from Harvard University as it is possible to imagine within the continental limits of the United States. The next year Fisch and his work moved again to begin the Peirce Project at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapo- lis, where it remains today. The Project contains two general catego- ries of material: those that support the chronological edition of Peirce's writings and those that support the biography Fisch intended to write. The first includes electroprints of all the Harvard microfilms, copies of appropriate documents and manuscripts from the National Archives, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the libraries at Harvard University, Southern Illinois University, Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, Princeton University, and at least fifty other depositories. It also includes bibliographical stud- ies and the research of contributing editors. The second, the Fisch material, includes an extensive chrono- logical file of at least 40,000 notecards (the beginning of which con- sisted in the more than 3000 notecards of my own research), con- taining a virtual narrative of most aspects of Peirce's life, beginning about 1820 and continuing to about 1940; an extensive subject file (of about the same length) cross-indexed to hundreds of file-boxes (which includes, for example, under A: abduction, ambidexterity, AAAS, analogy, analytic, anthropomorphic, architectonic, argument, Arisbe, Aristotle, art, association of ideas, Astor, atheism, Athenaeum (London), Atlantic Monthly, atom, and autobiographical); at least 100 files from correspondents on matters of interest; and bodies of</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 181 research by those who assisted him in the United States and in Eu- rope. In addition, there is a large, select library of books appropriate to a Peirce biography. Except for Fisch, Ketner, a well-established Peirce scholar, is the first and only Peirce biographer to have the unfettered use of this magnificent assemblage. Because of the censorship of Peirce's bio- graphical papers, Ketner's biography, therefore, carries an unfair bur- den; it is a pioneering work, as well as the carrier of the mean and tragic history of Peirce's papers and reputation. When I eagerly picked up the handsomely produced volume to read (which covers Peirce's life from 1839 until about 1870), it was with the highest expecta- tions and the keenest anticipation, despite its odd pretension as Peirce's autobiography. By the bottom of the first page of text, I was brought up short. The book begins: DEAR READER: my identity is significant, but ultimately of no importance. You need to understand a bit about me. I'm known as a mystery writer by trade, but I'm an amateur by inclination and instinct.... But my dilettante ways, now that I reflect, are more important to me than my writing.. ..From my father I received the name Louis Elisha Eisenstaat, but everyone has always called me Ike. I'm proud of my Harvard education, but I'm still an Okie at bottom.... This book... has been an exorcism, my way as an amateur psychologist to avoid becoming a professional - which is to say, continuing to be neurotically obsessed and mildly maniacal - about the topic of this volume. [I will place the page numbers from the book in parentheses. 3,4] How extraordinary, I mused, that Ketner should use his alter ego Okie Ike, self-confessed amateur and dilettante, as the narrator of a major biography of a great philosopher! In some confusion, I turned to the Preface, where I learned that "History is an abductive science" and "a story-telling art," that there are three fictional char- acters, Ike, the narrator, Betsey, and LeRoy, and that the Epilogue</page><page sequence="6">182 Book Reviews will explain what Ketner is doing (xiii). Fearing that abduction and fiction were about to become irremediably entangled, I turned to the Epilogue, subtitled, "On Method." There, Ketner admits that Peirce never wrote an autobiography, "of this length."(351). He then de- scribes how his format creates a fictional world, within which he strings together Peirce's autobiographical and philosophical writings, while filling in the gaps where needed. Ketner justifies this unusual and daring structure by saying that he learned from the writer Walker Percy "about the way in which truths can be expressed within proper fictional settings, in some cases better than in scientific prose," that he wants the book to read "as a good historical novel should be read," and that the "fact that the present work is fundamentally and ontologically fictional does not remove it from the category of schol- arship.'^ 352-353). For the reader, like me, who wishes actually to distinguish abduction from fiction, he provides a rule: The conversations of Ike Eisenstaat, Betsey Darbey, and LeRoy Wyttynys about Peirce are also based upon historical and philosophical research: mine and that of many other persons as indicated. However, the adventures of those three characters are fictional creations. (352) The rule, which seems simple, is remarkably difficult to apply. I will illustrate this difficulty by presenting the story of the identity of Peirce's second wife, the mysterious Juliette, (an obsession with Fisch, Ketner, and others), which is engagingly and forcefully told by LeRoy Wyttynys (whose portrait on page 341 is in fact that ofWalker Percy). The story is a good one, and is a cleverly detailed embroidery of the research origi- nally done for Fisch by Victor Lenzen, in 1972, into the possibility (one of several such possibilities) that Juliette was the illegitimate daughter, named Fabiola, of a French aristocrat and diplomat, Adolphe de Bacourt and a Spanish Gypsy woman, Agustina de Lopez, celebrated flamenco dancer and singer of cante jondoy both of whom had died before their daughter was six; that, in 1876, at age twelve, orphan Fabiola came to New York with a chaperone, the Marquise de Chambrun, where she</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 183 took the name Juliette Annette Froissy Pourtalai, lived in luxury and became the informal ward of a group that included the historian and diplomat George Bancroft and Peirce's father Benjamin; and that Peirce met her then, fell in love and married her seven years later, in 1883, when she was nineteen. Such are the bare bones of the romantic tale (279-292). Does it also count as an abduction, as Ketner intends? Bacourt, Lopez, and her daughter Fabiola are historical figures who are contemporary with Juliette, but the dates are problematic. Fabiola was born in 1864, but according to three outline sketches of Juliette's life written by Peirce in about 1890, Juliette was born in 1857. n The 1883 wedding certificate gives her age as 26, which is consistent with the out- lines. Ketner does not cite these sources, although he is aware of them, only Peirce's diary entry for January 6, 1914, noting Juliette's 50th birth- day and a neighbor's letter, both of which fit Fabiola's birthdate. The evidence provided for Juliette's gypsy background is forced far beyond its value. There is no evidence for Chambrun's chaperonage, for the group that cared for Fabiola, for her coming to New York, or for the other clever inventions of the story. This is poor science and poor schol- arship. I count the tale merely fiction. Lenzen, the creator of the Fabiola hypothesis, gave it up as highly unlikely, though perhaps reluc- tantly, as it is an appealing romance. The book contains several such confusions of fiction and hypoth- esis, but I will mention very briefly only one, the section headed, "A Secret Marriage," which begins, "Charley's first wife was Caroline Louise Badger..." (213-222). The claim is mistaken. What the evidence (in the form of letters from Badger to Peirce) supports is the hypothesis that Peirce, at age twenty, arrogantly planned and successfully carried out the seduction of Badger (whose family was down the social scale from the Peirces) by convincing her that they were married. For Peirce, it was in the nature of an experiment; as he put it, "You may do any- thing with a person who is in love with you." u When she realized how credulous she had been, Badger wrote him that "you are such an expe- rienced male-coquette you can give me a few lessons in flirting..." (221 ). If Ketner thinks that the evidence supports the existence of a genuine marriage contract, he is as gullible as poor Badger.</page><page sequence="8">184 Book Reviews While we may excuse these confusions as the result of Ketner's story-telling purpose, the confusions arising from the style and struc- ture of the book are more serious; they make it sometimes almost unreadable. Almost half of the book is made up of long selections of Peirce's words in italics, often without commentary. Some of these sequences are biographical, some philosophical and some have ele- ments of both. They are very well chosen and most of them are in print for the first time. By this means, Ketner intends to make Peirce's voice a unique and prominent element in the book and to reduce as much as possible his own intrusion into Peirce's life story. The strat- egy sadly fails for a number of reasons. The use of italics, rather than emphasizing and giving weight to Peirce's words, does the reverse. In contrast with ordinary type, which appears weighty and straight- forward, the lengthy sections of italics are difficult to read, appear washed out - almost disembodied - and the reader's eyes tend to skip. Because so many of the Peirce quotations are long, they create the effect of a separate book. Many of them are too long and create tedium. For example, there are twenty pages of letters in 1859-60 from Peirce to his family from various Coast Survey stations (178-198). Two or three pages would have been sufficient. In fact, this tendency to quote with- out analysis affects much of the book and often leaves the reader at a loss. There are some fifty pages, with occasional helpful analysis, covering Peirce's high school and college years, which include both biographical and philosophical matters (128-178). There are fifty-five pages of philo- sophical writings which present the development of Peirce's philosophy from 1865 to 1910 with two sections of analysis in LeRoy's Wyttynys's clear, but overbearing style (293-348). (There are even twenty pages of letters (107-127) from Benjamin Peirce to Josephine LeConte, a Geor- gia belle, whom he called "Queen of the Sciences," apparently included only to suggest that the two had an affair, since Ketner's introductory paragraphs establish the importance to Benjamin's professional life of her and her husband, the physicist John LeConte.) Without intense study (which is certainly worth the effort), very little of the quality of Peirce's character or thought comes through in these long sequences, except in the commentaries of Ketner's lively</page><page sequence="9">Book Reviews 185 fictional characters, Ike, Betsey, and LeRoy. Halfway through the book, their intrusive personalities and coarse sensibilities have taken over and Peirce has become a phantom, utterly dependent on them for definition of both character and thought, especially for the general reader. Ketner's strategy of giving Peirce his own voice, by means of long selected quotations in italics interspersed with commentary, has produced the reverse of what he intended, and we know considerably more about the biographer and his fictional characters than we do about Peirce. Fortunately, the historical content underlying the narra- tive style is solid and filled with information that is new for Peirce scholars and interesting to the general reader. As an example, I point to the excellent brief biography of Benjamin Peirce and his place in the social, educational, scientific, and political worlds of his time (75-96). In summary, the structure of the book jumps back and forth chronologically and in content and style between its various elements and leaves the reader confused by the labyrinth of multiple narrations and unanalyzed text. There is much wasted space in the book in addition to Peirce's early letters to his family and the letters from Benjamin to Josephine LeConte. The story of Juliette's origins, placed as it is almost twenty years out of chronological sequence, takes space and attention away from a discus- sion of the genuine importance of Peirce's first marriage (which Ketner calls the second marriage) to Melusina Fay. Unlike the relationship with Juliette which was empty of any exchange of philosophic ideas, that with Zina was filled with important discussions concerning the Categories, the status of women, and so forth. Some of Peirce's early work was written for her. In all, these fifty-five pages (and half that number again from other sources) might have been used to better advantage, perhaps to provide a fuller picture of science at the time, especially the impact of the Coast Survey as its preeminent scientific institution, perhaps to give more specific information on the sources of Peirce's thought, as exem- plified, for example, in the dominating influence of his father and in the 1865-66 lectures and the Journal of Speculative Philosophy series. Ketner's scholarly apparatus creates its own difficulties. He uses a scarcely visible superscript t after a word or phrase in place of footnote</page><page sequence="10">186 Book Reviews numbers. In the notes, page number, line and key word identify the source. He does this "to make it possible to read unimpeded - as a good historical novel should be read - the story of Peirce's life for its own sake as an interesting and enlightening piece of our national cultural heri- tage" (352). To illustrate: I became interested in a sequence of Peirce quotations (138-139) dealing with early metaphysical ideas. At first I thought there were six footnotes, but after several excursions to the notes and back, I discovered there were ten, but for some time, I could only find eight in the text. After much frustrating turning back and forth, I numbered the notes. Ketner could have used small numbers to aid the scholar without fear of impeding the general reader's enjoyment. As serious a problem for the scholar is the fact that most citations to Fisch's notes are virtually useless, because, while they give the lo- cation in Fisch's files by year and item number, they usually fail to give Fisch's sources, which Fisch always provides. To retrieve those sources, the researcher must consult the Fisch file in person at the Peirce Edition Project, which few can do. I have read Ketner's biography four times with care and, while the experience has been extremely frustrating for the reasons outlined, it has also been extraordinarily rewarding. Despite its flaws, it is an important and useful work, provided the reader is willing to treat it as an excellent collection of original sources interspersed with useful commentary. As a book, His Glassy Essence is a valuable failure. Ketner calls it "a tentative conversation about the nature and importance of Peirce's life" and "a work about a fallibilist by a fallibilist." He suggests that recent advances in publishing technology will make a thorough revi- sion of the entire effort possible once the third part is completed (353). I hope that Professor Ketner will accept this review in the spirit of "a tentative conversation" among fallibilists and that he will seriously consider revision before publication of the second volume in this series in the light of my critique.
