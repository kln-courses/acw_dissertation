<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORALITY, LITERACY, AND BATAK CONCEPTS OF MARRIAGE ALLIANCE Susan Rodgers Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Ohio University, Athens, OH 45 701 Research on the transition from oral to literate culture has much to offer students of kinship. This paper examines how the introduction of commercial printing and newspaper publishing has fostered a reformulation of Angkola Batak concepts of marriage alliance. Some folk portrayals present the wife-giver/wife-taker relationship in cosmological terms, while others present it as a social phenomenon. The diversity in homemade Angkola models of kinship is in part a consequence of the transition to literacy. Literate culture, moreover, is encircling ritual speech, forcing a re- thinking of Batak kinship in line with literacy's own biases. THIS PAPER IS AN EXPLORATION of the way contemporary Angkola Batak in North Sumatra shape, store, and communicate knowledge about their asymmetrical marriage alliance system through language. My particular focus is change; the paper examines some of the ways in which a shift from an oral culture to a literate one has pushed the Angkola to conceptualize kinship in new ways. The new formulation of kinship is in line with literacy's own conceptual biases and yields a kinship world portrayed in terms of social relationships and systemic relations. This sort of por- trayal of marriage alliance is particularly evident in certain types of newspaper writing and "ritual handbooks," two important outlets for Batak thought on kinship today.1 The imagery of alliance in the oral culture of ritual speeches, dirges, chants, and dance songs, by contrast, presents Batak marriage alliance as part and parcel of some universal, cosmic order. Both of these folk models of kinship exist in the culture today, making Batak ethnography particularly confusing to outsiders. I assert that the diversity of Angkola folk models of kinship is tied to a diversity in their linguistic culture, in which the remnants of a strong oral culture of ritualized speech forms is now encircled by a growing literate culture centered in cities and the Indonesian national culture. This "encirclement" is forcing some Angkola to rethink their kinship system, much as the transition to literacy often forces a people to recon- ceptualize oral speech in an imagery of writing and print. This situation makes for an extremely creative period in Batak thought about human relationships. A large anthropological literature exists concerning the symbolic systems associ- ated with asymmetrical marriage alliance in Indonesia (van Wouden 1968; Fox 1980) and mainland Southeast Asia (Leach 1954).2 Much of this work has been concerned with explicating the dualistic symbol systems often associated with wife giving and wife taking in these cultures. In eastern Indonesia, where asymmetrical alliance systems are quite numerous, wife-givers are often associated with spiritual superiority, height, an upper world, and the right side, while wife-takers are associated with spiritual inferiority, lowness, a mundane world, and the left. Wife-givers are often deemed the benevolent providers of blessings and fertility to their supplicant wife- takers. Good cosmic order depends on the proper relation between these binary opposites, and these cultures often hold that fertility and prosperity in general comes from the creative union of opposed elements. Binary oppositions often structure such diverse spheres as village layout, house architecture, ritual, clothing and decoration styles, and the formalized exchange of food and prestige goods. Many elegant anthropological essays have been written on these themes (see, e.g., Hicks 1976; 433</page><page sequence="2">434 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Forman 1980). Unfortunately, however, analysts of such symbolic systems in Indonesia rarely attend to processes of change, although many of these cultures are being transformed in far-reaching ways as Indonesia modernizes. The present attempt to examine the role of literacy in reshaping cultural traditions and ways of conceptualizing and categorizing the world offers one way to expand the analytical framework provided in such works as Fox (1980) and van Wouden (1968). The social complexity of Angkola homeland culture today demands an approach sensitive to social change. Angkola has named, exogamous patrilineal clans (marga) and asymmetrical marriage alliance with preferred MBD marriage. The clans are made up of small lineage segments called kahanggi; these are ideally localized in ancestral villages and trace descent from an ancestor four to six generations ago.3 Kahanggi of different clans are linked to each other through the patterned exchange of brides. The system is ideally asymmetrical: lineage A will receive its brides from lineage B but may not provide brides for B. Rather, A will bestow its sisters and daughters as brides on a third lineage, C. In practice, most kahanggi have multiple bride-givers (each called mora) and multiple bride-takers (anakboru), as well as a host of bride-takers of bride-takers and so on. In practice, too, a number of unorthodox marriages-some uniting descendants of kahanggi that should not marry-are being contracted today. Indeed, this may always have been the case (Bruner 1983). These marriage metaphors are used to forge political links both within and among villages. Some Angkola portrayals of marriage alliance are couched in grand, cosmological terms, with mora allied to the sacred, upper world and anakboru to the profane, lower world; their proper relationship is seen as necessary for the maintenance of cosmic order. This mode of legitimizing marriage alliance might be called the cosmological model. A second way of conceptualizing alliance (what I will call the social model) presents Batak kinship through a range of explicitly social images. That is, the relation of anakboru to mora is presented as something on the human plane, a social relationship contracted and maintained for explicitly moral reasons. In this version of Angkola kinship, anakboru should support mora because village etiquette demands it. Correspondingly, mora protects anakboru in an effort of good fellow feeling. The two folk models can be traced to distinctive sources in the oral and written culture. The view of kinship as part of some universal structure of existence is "carried" largely by certain genres of ritual adat speech. Below I examine some turi-turian chant texts in illustration of this. In contrast to this cosmic imagery, the view of Batak kinship as an event on the human plane is carried primarily through conversational speech and certain printed media. I examine several examples of this as well. The linguistic form and social location of the media carrying these contrastive views of alliance help explain the symbolic differences between the cosmological model of Angkola kinship and the social model. The rhetorical constraints and social location of ritual oral speech in Angkola culture today are tied in dialectical fashion to the elegant, symbolically redundant cosmological portrayal of Batak kinship as part of the universal order. Similarly the internal compositional techniques of such printed media as adat handbooks and newspaper articles, and their social location within Indonesian national culture today, are tied dialectically to the social model</page><page sequence="3">ORALITY, LITERACY, AND ALLIANCE 435 of Angkola kinship, a view created in an explicitly interethnic Indonesian national world. Walter Ong's work on orality and literacy is especially useful in examining pres- ent-day Batak culture. More than many scholars in the field, Ong is aware that the transition to literacy is not a simple, one-step jump across some great cognitive divide, to use Charles Frake's pointed phrase (1983). In his Orality and Literacy, Ong (1982) provides a framework for dealing with the interaction of oral forms, handwriting, print genres, and various electronic media in transitional societies. In the same book he also explores the relationship between forms of communication and forms of consciousness. My aim is not so ambitious, but Ong's work is useful as a guide in describing the forms of kinship legitimation presented in Angkola oral and written culture. ORALITY AND LITERACY IN CHANGING SOCIETIES The advent of literacy in oral cultures has attracted much recent study in philos- ophy (Ong 1977, 1982), psychology (Scribner and Cole 1981), and anthropology (Goody 1977, 1981; Goody and Watt 1981[1968]). Enthusiastic claims have been made for the pivotal importance of literacy in restructuring consciousness. A par- ticular form of alphabetic literacy has been heralded as the great invention setting off classical Greek civilization from other ancient cultures (Goody and Watt 1981 [1968]); literacy has been credited with introducing logical, linear thought into cultures theretofore dominated by mythic thought; literacy has even been suggested as the cultural force underlying Levi-Strauss's famous distinction between mythic and scientific ways of thought. These sweeping claims are the matter of some dis- pute; a good discussion is offered in Frake's recent review essay (1983) on Scribner and Cole (1981). Ong's Orality and Literacy (1982) suffers from some of the excesses associated with Goody's early claims for the primacy of literacy in cultural history. However, Ong does propose a typology of cultures according to their form of communication that is invaluable in considering the contemporary Angkola Batak. Ong's work allows us to specify with some precision why the language and kinship relationship in this cuture is so complex today. In a series of recent publications, Ong (1971, 1977, 1982) has been exploring the characteristics of oral cultures and the ways that writing, printing, and various electronic means for processing information restructure consciousness. Ong is particularly concerned that we understand primary oral cultures (those without writing) on their own terms, not through images derived from our own literate culture. He makes the familiar point, for instance, that epic poets working in prelit- erate cultures have quite a different concept of their work than do poets in cultures with writing. In fact, he notes, it is a misnomer to speak of the "oral literature" of preliterate cultures. Such terms, Ong holds, are ethnocentric concepts tied to the technical level of the modern scholar's own literate culture (1982:14-15). Ong's research, then, executed as it is from within a literate culture, is an exercise in the sort of "communication across diversity" advocated by the editors of The Imagination of Reality: Essays in Southeast Asian Coherence Systems (Becker and Yengoyan 1979).</page><page sequence="4">436 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Ong describes four basic types of cultures: (1) primarily oral cultures, relying on various ritualized genres and mnemonic devices to retain crucial information; (2) chirographic cultures, with writing; (3) typographic cultures, with printing; (4) and electronic cultures, like our own, that can retain information through recordings, film, and computers. These last cultures experience a kind of "secondary orality," a renaissance of oral communication through the telephone, television, recordings, and so on. A shift to a new stage does not mean the demise of the earlier one. That is, a culture with writing does not dispense with the information- storage devices of its older oral literature; but once writing becomes widespread, the culture's use of older genres and its view of language change. For instance, the sort of linear narrative with relatively little redundancy that writing makes possible can become a new standard for storytelling in the culture at large. Put another way, the various rhetorical devices used in the written culture in turn affect the folk under- standing of the oral traditions. Ong goes beyond this to trace links between the orality or literacy of a culture and its forms of consciousness. Oral cultures generally have luxurious repertoires of poetry, myth, proverbs, and other set-form genres of speech. Much of the knowledge about social organization in such a culture is preserved and transmitted through these oral, largely formulaic devices. Set rhyme schemes, verse structures, and the use of objects and recurrent situations as mnemonic devices to elicit portions of the oral culture are all common techniques in these cultures. Culture is, in Ong's words, repeated and repeated and repeated in these societies. With such a structure, overwhelmingly oral cultures encourage a focus on situations rather than abstractions, foster communalism and traditionalism rather than solitary introspection and innovation, and propose a world view where words hold power instead of simply acting as "labels" for things. The introduction of writing into such a culture brings deep conceptual change in many spheres of thought. If "the savage mind totalizes" (a line from Livi-Strauss that Ong quotes often), consciousness in written culture dissects and analyzes (Ong 1982:39, citing Levi-Strauss 1966:245). Writing allows a person to break out of the actual conversational setting to communicate with a large range of contemplative readers with whom he has no necessary social relationship. In short, Ong posits a specific "psychodynamics of orality" (Ong 1982:31-77) and contrasts this with views of the world fostered by advanced literacy. Oral cultures are communally oriented; reading and writing, by contrast, are "solitary activities that throw the psyche back on itself" (Ong 1982:69). Oral cultures are also inherently traditionalist and conservative, but in a rather subtle way: the "tradition" is minutely adjusted to contemporary political situations (a point discussed at length in Goody and Watt 1981[1968]). Beyond this, oral cultures exist "close to the human lifeworld" (Ong 1982:42). Experience is defined in reference to "immediate, familiar interaction of human beings" (1982:42). In cultures with writing, and even more with print, the social order is broken up into an abstract collection (or even list) of social categories, devoid of individual biographies or immediate social contexts. The perception of sound in an oral culture and in those with writing and print also differs, and influences the larger world view (Ong 1982:73). Ong notes that words in oral cultures exist only in sound, without secondary references to palpable</page><page sequence="5">ORALITY, LITERACY, AND ALLIANCE 437 texts (although ritual words in such cultures are often associated with various mnemonic devices in the material culture, such as memory beads). In an oral culture, a person is the center of the spoken universe he speaks (Ong 1982:73): The centering action of sound (the field of sound is not spread out before me but is all around me) affects man's sense of the cosmos. For oral cultures, the cosmos is an ongoing event with man at its center. Man is the umbilicus mundi, the navel of the world ... Only after print and extensive experience with maps that print implemented would human beings, when they thought about the cosmos or universe or 'world', think primarily of something laid out before their eyes, as in a modem printed atlas, a vast surface or assemblage of surfaces (vision presents surfaces) ready to be 'explored.' In fact, Ong asserts, the economy of sound in primary oral cultures is central to their 'totalizing' tendencies (Ong 1982:73-74): A sound-dominated verbal economy is consonant with aggregative (harmonizing) tenden- cies rather than with analytic, dissecting tendencies (which would come with the inscribed, visualized word: vision is a dissecting sense). It is consonant also with the conservative holism (the homeostatic present that must be kept intact, the formulary expressions that must be kept intact), with situational thinking (again holistic, with human action at the center) rather than abstract thinking, with a certain humanistic organization of knowledge around the actions of human and anthropomorphic beings, interiorized persons, rather than around impersonal things. The introduction of literacy in effect fractures this harmonized world of primary orality. Writing introduces the possibility of extended, reflective critical argument (Goody and Watt 1981 [1968] :44ff.) and fosters a sort of institutionalized skepticism about a culture's main beliefs (Goody and Watt 1981[1968]). Literacy often leads to the creation of highly specialized bodies of knowledge and the development of cadres of experts to build and interpret that knowledge. Writing fosters history making, not myth telling. Writing refocuses communication away from the word and the conversation to the written symbol and the palpable text. Alphabetic writing allows authors to write about all manner of human concerns and interactions, not just the stereotypic situations that are the focus of conventionalized oral genres. Finally writing and reading allow a culture to discover alternate ethnic worlds through their literary products. This in turn sometimes leads to efforts to systematize cultural diversity into some larger scheme. Obviously many of the conceptual features Ong associates with primary orality are found as well in Angkola's conceptual model of kinship, while many of the "psychodynamics of literacy" are evident in the social model of kinship as part of human activity. After a brief description of Angkola homeland communication, these associations can be examined via translated texts. ANGKOLA ORAL AND WRITTEN CULTURE The Angkola ethnic homeland in the subprovince of South Tapanuli is predomi- nantly agricultural, dependent on wet rice farming.4 Coffee, vegetables, cloves, and forest rubber are grown for supplemental income by families in both villages and market towns. Angkola villages, which have no 'traditional adat houses' (swoop- backed compound household dwellings) are fairly large in comparison to settlements in other Batak homelands; many Angkola villages have thirty to fifty households. Some families claim that they live in the village because it is their ancestral lineage</page><page sequence="6">438 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH village, 'opened out of the forest' by their forebears. These people claim to 'own the adat' in the village. Other residents say they are descendants of the core group's traditional wife-givers or traditional wife-takers, both purportedly brought along, in idealvillages at least, when the settlement was first founded. Other families associated themselves with the dominant lineage via a variety of marriage-alliance and clan- descent ties (wife-takers of wife-takers, and so on). In this way any new family to the village-even the public health service nurse or the policeman-can always calculate some plausible alliance or clan relationship with the village owners. Indeed Angkola Batak are masters at stretching their tutur ("kinship-term talk") to encompass any new acquaintance and at "discovering" a relationship through marriage exchange and/or genealogical ties. Thus, any new bride, as long as she is Batak, is quickly transformed in village speech into the ideal marriage choice, the boru tulang, or MBD. The same metaphors of descent, alliance, and hierarchical relationship between 'superior', 'higher' wife-givers and their indebted, 'inferior' wife-takers is used to structure political relationships between the dominant lineages of different villages. Thus, the rajas (village owners) of Bungabondar have a number of ritually subservient wife-receiving rajas in a penumbra of smaller villages around them, much as they have resident wife-takers in their home village. The Bungabondar rajas are also linked to other raja families in other villages through clan ties. Under the Dutch colonial administration, which controlled the area from about 1850 to 1942 (the date of the Japanese occupation during World War II), Angkola was organized into fairly hierarchical chiefdoms. Dutch control rigidified the local political system, but no full-fledged state developed.5 Today, under the national government, villages and towns are administered as units of the Republic of Indonesia, and hierarchical relationships between dominant lineages have become ceremonialized and largely removed from the realm of secular politics.6 Salaried work has great prestige value today and is available in the government bureaucracies, the large public school system, and economic development projects. Many Angkola have migrated to cities and oil-boom projects outside the homeland; prestige attaches to permanent residence in the area beyond the homeland. Angkola is open to the wider Indonesian nation through the Sumatran road system, the public schools, and the mass media in Indonesian. Radios and tape players are ubiquitous, and some families in towns with nighttime electricity have purchased television sets. The contemporary language situation is approximately the following. In the villages and small market towns in the South Tapanuli ethnic homeland, Angkola Batak is generally used as the language of the home, the market, the adat ceremony, and everyday conversation. The national language, Indonesian, introduced to school children in the third grade, after early schooling in Angkola Batak, is used in the printed culture (city newspapers, government documents, almost all commercial books and pamphlets), in films, in most radio shows, and in the television broadcasts now penetrating the region thanks to the national satellite relay system. Small children and elderly women in the farm villages often know little Indonesian, but almost everyone else is fluent in both Indonesian and Angkola Batak. Well-educated men and women in their sixties and seventies often remember some Dutch from</page><page sequence="7">ORALITY, LITERACY, AND ALLIANCE 439 their colonial era primary schools, and many adults of that age and younger know another Batak dialect or even another ethnic language, if they have lived outside the homeland. Muslims often know a number of prayer phrases and terms in Arabic. Although Protestant church services in the homeland are conducted in Angkola Batak, many Christians have a fluent reading knowledge of Toba Batak, a very close Batak dialect, because the translation of the Bible used in Angkola until 1977 was a Toba version. It must be noted that this neat schema of language use is imprecise in important ways. Today many Indonesian phrases, terms, and even grammatical structures are used in both everyday and ritual Angkola Batak. Arabic phrases, Dutch words, and even English words are used in all types of conversation and formal oratory. In Angkola Batak, in addition to a great deal of speech about speech, there are a number of genres of speech "in the adat." The major types are summarized in Table 1. TABLE 1 Term Type of Ritual Speech Speakers Occasion kobar basic adat oration all married adults various gift-giving occasions, feast occasions, etc., in adat rites of passage andung mourning dirges girls and married women occasions of leave taking: burial, departure of bride for her new home alok-alok traditional political oratory rajas, married men horja-level rituals osong-osong verbal duel between mora experts, men and/or horja-level rituals for and anakboru women births, weddings, house-entries onang-onang songs for ritual dancing expert male singers horja-level rituals "reading" orations for "reading" expert male or female pangupa-level rituals, speeches meaning from ritual objects orators horja-level rituals "blessing" for conveying good fortune rajas, mora pangupa-level rituals, speeches horja-level rituals turi-turian chanted sagas male experts special sessions; accompaniment to certain horja rituals The printed culture in the homeland consists of school texts and circulars in Angkola and Indonesian; a few novels and short stories in Angkola but many more in Indonesian (Rodgers Siregar 1981a); Medan and Jakarta newspapers in Indonesian; church publications in both languages; Islamic publications and the Koran in Arabic and Indonesian; advertising and product-packaging material in Indonesian and</page><page sequence="8">440 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH English; and Indonesian government documents in Indonesian. There is a syllabic Batak script, related to some south Sumatran systems, but it is little used today. Homeland primary schools teach it, but the Latin alphabet is in regular use for both Angkola and Indonesian. The Batak script is used on some adat ritual objects and was once apparently a part of the esoteric lore of datu sorcerer/diviners. Using Ong's framework, Angkola Batak culture today is a nascent electronic cul- ture that has, importantly, retained a large residue of its oral culture. It is important to note that the Angkola transition from a primary oral culture to writing, printing, and, as the Indonesian government puts it, a "space-age" electronic culture has been extremely swift. The Angkola homeland has a rich oral literature linked simulta- neously with a particular ethnic kinship and political system, the modernizing economy, and the Indonesian state; and a new electronic culture just beginning to penetrate Tapanuli with tape recorders, radios, films, and television. All of Ong's stages exist at once, and all mutually influence each other. Families are beginning to tape-record the ritual orations at their adat weddings and funerals (videotaping cannot be far behind); newspaper authors are writing about oral proverbs; orators are rearranging their speeches under the influence of written compositional standards; Christian preachers compose sermons by combining adat sayings and quotations from the New Testament. In some important ways, the oral culture and the various literate cultures are stratified socially. The oral culture of verbal duels, mythic chants, and praise songs lives on most luxuriantly in the minds of Angkola's old people, while many adults and children can produce few of the adat speeches and poems. Related to this is the fact that younger people have more access to the electronic culture of modernizing Indonesia, as well as relatively more access to the national language. In this context some portions of the ritual adat speech are becoming a relatively isolated island of esoterica. Adat speech, like Angkola adat itself, is an inherently flexible, adjustive system created in dialogue with the Indonesian language, the Arabic of the Islamic prayers, and the larger conceptual structures of the nation. Adat is certainly not adequately seen as some pristine "older culture of the ancestors," as many Angkola would portray it. However, some portions of ritual speech are being perceived as self-consciously old-fashioned forms. This nostalgic designation is in itself, of course, a creation of Angkola's modernizing situation. The print and electronic media, by design, open outward to other Indonesian ethnic groups and to Indonesian national monotheistic culture itself. The contrast between this form of communication and ritual oral forms can be demonstrated through several texts. ALLIANCE IN RITUAL SPEECH In conversational speech, marriage alliance is generally discussed in reference to the dalihan na tolu, in reference to anakboru and mora per se, or in reference to particular people who stand as anakboru or mora to the speaker.7 The alliance relationship of conversational partners is often explicitly noted by one or both speakers in such relatively stylized encounters as minor everyday gift exchanges or a meeting after a long absence. In the ritual adat speech, however, the occasion generally calls for more flowery references to one's speaking partners and more</page><page sequence="9">ORALITY, LITERACY, AND ALLIANCE 441 elaborate apologia for anakboru or mora and the dalihan na tolu itself. The oral literature has a profusion of verbal duels, hortatory speeches, praise orations, and "blessing words" traded between wife-givers and wife-takers during weddings, funerals, and many less ceremonial encounters on the street (Rodgers 1978). In the adat oratory, in fact, the Angkola state quite explicitly that gifts of magical words from giver mora groups to taker anakboru groups are as necessary to the upkeep of good social and cosmological order as the well-placed gift of brides, ritual textiles, and specially prepared foods. Beyond this almost palpable exchange of gift words between givers and takers, there are two other realms of language that deal with marriage alliance: kin terms and speech that takes marriage alliance as a topic of discussion. The latter includes relatively free-form oratory at weddings, in which the speaker discusses alliance as part of his advice speeches to the newlyweds (Rodgers Siregar 1979a). Not surprisingly, there are numerous proverbs about alliance; but beyond this, orators often apostrophize the idea of alliance in the midst of speeches on more limited themes. Texts from many different genres of ritual speech could be taken as examples to show the cosmological presentation of marriage alliance, but I consider only turi-turian chants here. As an unusually stylized and socially exclusive form of speech, turi-turian do represent an extreme: alliance is set out here in unusually bold cosmological terms. Many orators at weddings and funerals portray the proper maintenance of anakboru/mora relations as crucial to the maintenance of good village order and, in a larger sense, to good order in all of the homeland. The carefully patterned flow of exchange goods, starting at the wedding and structurally balanced at the funeral, is seen as necessary to the upkeep of village order. And, by extension, this one set of exchanges at this one funeral is crucial to the overall maintenance of anakboru/ mora relations. Turi-turian chanted sagas go beyond this, to assert connections between the anakboru/mora relationship and the very structure of the cosmos. Chanted in an eerie dirge late at night, the turi-turian are majestic narratives of mythic proportions, relating the adventures of extraordinary human heroes, rajas, and animals in an ancient age. In the turi-turian of the Angkola and Padang Bolak areas, much of the action consists of visits paid by denizens of the lower world of human existence to an upper world of mystic rajas and their beautiful daughters. The visits go in the other direction, too, as noble residents of the "Upper Continent" take exploratory sojourns into the human realm. In the turi-turian of Datuk Tuanku Tuan Malim Leman, the one I examine here, the Upper Continent is the domain of a great raja and his seven beautiful daughters; the lower, human world is the residence of humans and the young men who court the daughters. Humans stand in an anakboru relationship to the great raja-the hero of the piece marries one of the daughters, and in fact the alliance relationship is portrayed as a long-standing one. The action of the chant consists of the visit of the noble daughter to the human world, her marriage there, and her eventual tragic return to her father's heavenly palace. The story is a Batak version of a narrative found in many ethnic societies in Sumatra and Malaysia. In fact the names of many of the characters in this turi-turian</page><page sequence="10">442 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH show Minangkabau influence; this surely indicates that it is a mistake to think of adat speech of this sort as pristine and unchanging. The point to stress here, however, is the internal structure and social location of this form of chanted speech. The exact events change with each retelling, but in the two-night-long version I tape-recorded, the hero is first sent on a quest for a magical deer that a datu (diviner-sorcerer) says is necessary to cure the boy's ailing mother. Datuk Tuanku Tuan Malim Leman dies in pursuit of the deer, but is miraculously brought back to life by his boru tulang (MBD), a daughter of the raja of the upper world. The hero's younger brother dies during the adventures, but Datuk Tuanku continues on, through several more quests for potions to cure his mother. Along the way, seven daughters of the raja of the upper spirit kingdoms come down to earth for their yearly frolic in a stream. Datuk Tuanku espies his boru tulang bathing and steals her "flying suit," which she has left on a rock, thus preventing her from flying back home to the upper world with her sisters. The two get married and have a son, but the girl stipulates that she will go back home if her husband ever tells the son that "she was a bride who was found-by-the-road, not a proper bride with an earthly family." The young son does eventually find out that his mother is not a human being, and she promptly steals back her flying suit from her husband and leaves them, departing from the earth by first ascending Mt. Nanggar Jati, a sharp peak near Sipirok. The father and son pursue the woman up Nanggar Jati and into the Upper Kingdom, and the family is eventually reunited. An early verse gives the flavor of the turi-turian style: Heeeeeeeeeeeeeey----------------------.-----------------Many are the branches of the tall tree, more branches still to the little bush, many are the words of the Commoner Lords, but more words still to the turi saga, telling of the pain and misfortunes of those of earlier times. Plucking branches off a bush, bits of weed get plucked up too, the words of the turi saga are set out, and all things sad get remembered. What then, Ancestor, this is like bending down the bamboo tree, and lifting free the birdnest, this is like recalling all our longings, and breaking open all the pain, the misfortune of the raja, Datuk Tuanku Tuan Malim Leman. The turi-turian chanter often adds the usual elegaic phrases to each mention of the major kinship categories. Throughout this and other turi-turian, the identification of the upper world with bride giving and a spiritual order of existence is quite clear. These broader symbolic ramifications of the anakboru/mora pair are sometimes briefly alluded to in the standard kobar oratory and in sayings inserted into everyday speech (for instance, a common phrase for mora is mora langit habiaran: "mora fearsome sky"). However, only in the turi-turian is such an extensive symbolism of upper world/lower world, mora/anakboru evident. Witness the following typical passage about one noble Upper-World girl seeking to aid Datuk Tuanku Tuan Malim Leman, her father's sister's son. The young protagonists operate in a clearcut anakboru/mora framework, with mora associated with the sacred sky world. Heeeeeeeeeeeeeey---------------------------------- --Look once again my friend to the Delta of the Foaming River, to the Ghost Town of the Ancient Waterway, to the meeting place of the ten waterways, to the vantage point of the Eight Dominions, to the Wondrous Peninsula, to the Vantage Point of the Eight Dominions: her eyes-the-peerers no longer saw the body of the son of her namboru (FZ).

The remainder of the turi-turian deals with conflict and changing relations between the Upper World and the human plane, given voice through the human anakboru men. The social location of the turi-turian is also important. In a word, in the form presented above, the genre is moribund. The turi-turian are largely unknown to homeland Angkola under the age of sixty, except in the exceptional village with its own chanter. The turi-turian portray alliance as something inherent in the very nature of things in the universe. The high ritual oratory, however, is shrinking back to occupy a very small portion of Angkola spoken culture. The Cosmological model of kinship it carries is also suffering a loss of scope, and is in a sense staging a strategic retreat in the face of the social portrayal of Batak kinship. ALLIANCE IN THE PRINTED CULTURE A shift toward a more thoroughgoing social exegesis of the meaning of anak- boru and mora in the printed culture is evident in examining almost any genre. I concentrate here on commercially published adat handbooks in Angkola Batak and Indonesian-language newspaper articles about Batak kinship. Both these types of publications are directed toward an audience of leisure readers tied to the authors not through specific kinship bonds but through shared ethnic or even national identity. This fact shapes the portrayal of Batak kinship in the publications. In the newspaper articles I examine, the authors talk of Batak descent and alliance, taking these as pan-Batak phenomena, not stopping to differentiate the Toba Batak from the Angkola, the Karo, and so on. The newspaper stories go farther, to set Batak kinship themes within a national Indonesian context and within a monotheistic social ethic as well. And, as so often happens in discussions of Batak ethnic culture in the national mass media, the discussion is couched in terms of the familiar triad of adat, negara (the Indonesian nation), and agama (the monotheistic religions). Angkola Batak have published several adat handbooks and proverb samplers since the early 1960s (Marpaung and Sohuturon 1962; Marpaung 1969). The handbooks are generally step-by-step guides on how to stage the major adat rituals. These usually have sample speeches, with appropriate commentary by the author. The audience is apparently intended to be the group of city young people, who are unfamiliar with their village adat, and the group of elderly adat connoisseurs in the homeland towns and cities, who enjoy reading about the fine points of ritual practice. There are handbooks for staging a bride-price negotiation session, a wedding, and so on. My text here is a more unusual sort of handbook, a sampler of proverbs with extended commentary. Baginda Marakub Marpaung, the author of a standard adat handbook (1969), published his sampler (with B.R. Sohuturon) Pundjut-pundjutan in 1962 with the Angkola publisher Islamyah, in Medan. The little book, covering 740 proverbs and adat sayings, is an intriguing transitional work, for it takes the hoariest</page><page sequence="12">444 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH oral proverbs, complete with cosmological references, and interprets them, in print, in light of their social implications. The senior author, a Christian church father, sometimes goes on to substitute references to God for the older Batak references to upper spirit kingdoms and unseen spirits. When Baginda Marakub and his coauthor do mention facets of an older, strictly Batak cosmology, they usually take care to frame the reference in a cautious "It is said . . ." form. This of course distances the authors, and by extension their audience, from the older Batak "customs." Through the use of such framing techniques, they turn Batak cosmological references into quaint customs predating the present enlightened, monotheistic age. At the same time, they attempt to establish the social conventions of Angkola anakboru/mora relationships as one ethnic social arrangement among many in pluralistic modern Indonesia. The authors' exegesis of several proverbs demonstrate this process. Angkola has many proverbs on speech; Marakub and Sohuturon consistently highlight the social consequences of breaking rules of speech etiquette. In this example, the paragraph following the proverb itself is the authors' commentary (Marpaung and Sohuturon 1962:6-7). 7. Jolo mangangguk anso manyoro. Those who howl before they pounce. Mangangguk means to have-a-loud-and-fierce-voice. Now, if the voice of the tiger is loud and fierce, his intended victim will immediately get startled, because he will be afraid of that voice and will know right away that there is danger nearby. So, if the tiger makes a big to-do getting ready to pounce on his prey, he won't get it, because the intended victim will already have run away. Behavior like this is compared to the behavior of a person about whom you always hear great things, but nothing ever comes of it-one gets nothing from him. Big talk, but nothing to back it up in action. These commentaries neglect other Angkola interpretations of speech: the idea that a graceful speaking style can be inherited in complex ways through chiefly lineages; the notion that fine speech is a demonstration of the orator's sahala (the magical glow and power of the rajas); and the idea that sickness, household disaster, and agricultural failure can follow "automatically" from certain breaches of adat. In a series of similar exegetical explanations of sayings relating to anakboru and mora, Marakub and Sohuturon sometimes offer a social explanation and sometimes a more cosmological one. Importantly, though, their cosmological explanations are all implicitly or explicitly framed in the "our ancestors used to think" style. This first example shows the authors concentrating on the social-intercourse aspects of kin relationships (Marpaung and Sohuturon 1962:36). 94. Eme sibonang manita, nada podo pinangan madung binoto daina. Sibonang manita rice, not yet eaten but mother already knows how delicious it is. The first part of the saying is only to meet the sound of the second part. The actual meaning of the saying is in the second part. Usually these words are said when one is about to eat food-brought-on-banana-leaves to us by our family, to say how delicious it all is. The food isn't smelled yet, but you already know how delicious it is, because relatives-of-good-heart have brought it to you. Actually, one's feelings are already full, just hearing the speeches of the relatives who have brought the food. But they add a gift of delicious rice to this to boot. Because of this, everybody with relatives has to give flattering words to each other, so that everything is good and friendly.</page><page sequence="13">ORALITY, LITERACY, AND ALLIANCE 445 A second example highlights the realm of "hurt feelings," not taboo (Marpaung and Sohuturon 1962:224-25): 650. Suhisuhi ni hata nada tola dohonan. The words' elbows, we may not say. The "words' elbows" mean words we are not permitted to say. Whatever is forbidden in words, or whatever hurts our friends, that is what we must not say. For instance, people who talk about some disaster befalling their friends or their ancestors are only succeeding in hurt- ing other people. A third saying has clear ties to an older Batak world of automatic cosmological sanctions for adat transgressions relating to kinship. However, the authors relativize those claims in a tone of almost ethnographic dispassion (Marpaung and Sohuturon 1962:56): 154. Hata so juangon, tuktuk so balosan. Words that cannot be challenged, decisions that meet no objections. The speech of people who have awe-inspiring power and might (sangap) cannot be fought against. No matter what he says it must be listened to, because all that he thinks is very good. No matter what he decides, one cannot talk back to it. In kin relations (in partuturan) mora is called the speaker-who-cannot-be-challenged, the decision-maker-who-cannot-be-talked-back-to, for according to the beliefs of folks from where we come from, whoever puts up a fight against mora, he is the one who will disappear or come into disaster. Mora, that is the road God used to give good fortune (tua) to their anakboru. Because of that one may not put up a fight against one's mora, one must always make-them- full-of-awe-inspiring-powers-and-might, even though they really might be poor. Similarly, the authors' treatment of adat sayings dealing directly with anakboru and mora often acknowledges their larger cosmological implications for earlier generations, but not for this present generation of enlightened sophisticates (Mar- paung and Sohuturon 1962:104). 302. Mata ni ari so gakgahon. Sun beyond staring. If one stares straight into the sun-beaming sun or tries to examine it, one will get sun-stung and one's eyes will hurt for it. We may well see darkness because of it. In adat, mora is said to be sun beyond staring. According to adat and according to people's beliefs, mora is like the road God uses to give blessings (pasupasu) to its anakboru. Because of that, it is the same as if one is no longer sure in one's heart (roha) of getting good fortune (tua) from one's mora. Oftentimes people put this [proverb] sun beyond staring with un- plumbed deep pool. In summary, writers like these work from the printed culture, looking "back" at the products of an older oral culture. They read intention and set meaning into adat sayings, implying that each saying has a corresponding meaning. In the oral culture, by contrast, each proverb has a host of shifting meanings, depending on the speaking situation and the speaker's own social location. Since the authors are writing a book, they use discursive prose with logical, linear arguments to bolster their interpretations. This is in contrast to the less-linear style of ritual oratory, which deals in suggestive metaphor, not sequential arguments. The authors' audience is also set by their genre: they are addressing the group of Angkola Batak speakers, but make no further distinctions according to kin relationship. In actual adat oratory use of such proverbs, the target audience would of course stand in a definable descent or alliance relationship to the speaker. As a consequence of the proverbs' presentation in book form, they have no magic to them: they cannot convey blessings from mora</page><page sequence="14">446 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH or offer support from anakboru. The explanations of the proverbs do have consider- able charm, but it is the charm of an engaging writer, not a scintillating orator. There is another major difference between Pundjut-pundjutan's printed presenta- tion of proverbs and their use in the oral culture. In ritual adat speeches, orations delivered from anakboru to mora and so on are part of a complex, coherent, redun- dant system of oratory, ritual dance, ritual textiles, seating arrangements, house architecture, and so on. The anakboru/mora relationship is presented with great redundancy in the major adat rituals where the "high oratory" is spoken. For instance, where anakboru lowers himself in speech before the beneficent mora, anakboru also lowers himself before mora in his dance positions, seating arrange- ments, hand and body movements when serving food, use of the ritual textiles, and so on. In printed adat handbooks, this dense, coherent system is not preserved. Rather, speech is excised from its ritual moorings and examined in relative isolation. Authors such as Marpaung disentangle adat speech from the many other channels of ritual communication used in the adat for conveying core social messages (see Leach 1966). Newspaper articles on kinship go farther along this path of secularization. The Indonesian-language Medan newspaper Sinar Indonesia Baru (SIB) is a Toba-Batak- owned and dominated paper that publishes a weekly cultural affairs page on the ethnic customs of various Sumatran peoples. Batak kinship, not surprisingly, gets heavy play. The articles are written by regular reporters, or, more often, by special contributors who deem themselves expert in some facet of the adat. From 16 to 20 November 1976, the provincial government convened a "Seminar Adat" on Batak adat in Pematang Siantar. This conference-like gathering was sponsored by IRAPAS ("Indonesia Regional Asia Program for Advanced Studies," in English in the original). SIB published a long series of discussions of the conference topics. A particular area of dispute, apparently, was the meaning of opat sihal-sihal ("four support stones") in the phrase dalihan na tolu paopat sihal-sihal ("three hearth stones, four support stones"; the four support stones are extra rocks placed beneath the regular hearth stones to ensure balance). Some SIB contributors asserted that the "four support stones" phrase was simply an innocuous reference to the addition of extra support from lineage mates, or alternatively, village rajas, to the basic three-part structure of Batak kinship. Other writers, however, were more suspicious of the discussion, and saw the government interest in the possibility of a four-part Batak social order as a dangerous opportunity for central government interference in ethnic affairs. The authors did not state this fear directly, as newspapers are subject to tight government censorship, but the implication was clear to informed readers. The series of articles is an illuminating one for investigating the handling of Batak kinship themes in print. The headlines of three typical articles on the topic are a good indication in them- selves of the general climate of the debate: "The Social Function of Sihal-Sihal in Relation to the Dalihan na Tolu ...," by Professor Dr. P. Sormin. (SIB, 15 Nov. 1977, p. 3). "Investigating the Dalihan na Tolu Four Support Stones in the Philosophy of the Batak People," by P. Hutajulu, Pematang Siantar. (SIB, 6 Nov. 1976, p. 5). "The Three-Part and Four-Part Thought System of Batak People," by Pastor Dr. A.B. Sinaga. (SIB, 11 Dec. 1976, p. 5).</page><page sequence="15">ORALITY, LITERACY, AND ALLIANCE 447 Note the fascination with numbers, a preoccupation of other Indonesian ethnic groups and city newspaper publishing. In the articles themselves, the phrases dalihan na tolu and so on are sometimes abbreviated to acronymns, another national pastime especially evident in the printed Indonesian-language culture. Of course the most striking feature of the headlines is the frank mention of the social function (fungsi social) of various kinship ideas. In addition, each author is concerned with the logical thought structure of this sector of Batak adat; they cast their arguments in a would- be scholarly philosophical style, in line with this concern. For instance, Sormin divides his discussion into headings with Roman numerals and subdivides these into two levels of smaller units. All the headlines and most of the stories themselves are in the national language; the authors take care to translate most Batak terms, making the articles at least superficially intelligible to a non-Batak audience (Sormin 1976). Sormin's article illustrates six points. First, in newspaper articles like this, Batak kinship is treated as a system. More specifically, it is seen as a philosophical system. Second, this philosophical system is open to exegesis by cultured experts. Third, the dalihan na tolu is seen as one system among others in multiethnic Indonesia. Related to this is a certain defensiveness about "confusing" Batak alliance and descent with elements of other comparable systems. Fourth, Batak adat and kinship matters can be discussed at the level of some pan-Batak culture. Fifth, the dalihan na tolu is inherently changeable. One of its main benefits, in fact, is held to be its flexibility. Sixth, a single God set up the world to have adat systems of just this type, with one adat system corresponding to each of God's peoples. The constraints of newspaper publishing demand many of these assertions. Inter- national standards of newspaper prose demand a certain informative, discursive style for feature articles of this type. Newspaper publishing demands further that authors establish themselves as experts of some sort, with a grasp of bodies of knowledge not fully accessible to the regular readership. Moreover, paragraph structure demands the sort of point-by-point exposition practiced here. Working from a strongly literate sector of Indonesian culture, Sormin presents his ideas on kinship as logical conten- tions, which he sets out to buttress with logical proof. He implicitly recognizes that some of his readers will be skeptical of some of his points. Finally, he stresses logic over verbal showmanship. His prose style is dry and matter-of-fact, in contrast to the verbal pyrotechnics of the adat oratory. CONCLUSIONS The process discussed in this paper may be a widespread one in Indonesia and other modernizing nations. I have described a movement from a cosmological form of legitimating kinship to a more secular, more explicitly social series of symbols. This movement can, at least in part, be explained in reference to a shift in the culture from orality to literacy. Contemporary Angkola culture has a large residue of its older oral culture, but this residue is increasingly isolated and encapsulated within a dominant print culture. The cosmological model of kinship, and the ritual speech forms that support it, suffer the consequences of this "encirclement." Kinship emerges as a systemic phenomenon, a matter of human relationships, and a topic of the analytical intellect.</page><page sequence="16">448 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Aram Yengoyan (1979) has recently pointed out that in many non-Western societies, the domain of structure, set into myth, dominates behavior. The Australian Aborigines' reliance on the Dreamtime myths as a seamless rationale for the vagaries of actual social life is an extreme example of this. In such cultures, Yengoyan writes (1979:329), "behavior change and social fluctuations have a minimal effect on the presence of the rule." Similarly, in traditional Indonesian cultures, there is thought to be a close relationship between cosmology, idealized adat rules, and emergent social behavior-much as any Batak bride of whatever kin relationship to the groom is termed a 'mother's brother's daughter' in Angkola society, for instance, ideal structure in these cultures can accommodate all social eventualities. But, Yengoyan goes on to note (1979:329), with modernization comes a fracturing of the symbolic continuity: With the breakdown of cosmological homogeneity and the fracturing of systems of knowledge, the specific interconnection between structure and event takes another course. When moral imperatives and cosmological worlds are modified or collapse, structures commonly become expressions of events. Structure is thereby reduced to being the summation of individual acts and behaviors. This condition not only characterizes most of the industrialized nation-states of the modern world, but also represents a concept of social order common within Western social science. The transition explored in the present paper may best be seen as part of this larger process, which has implications for anthropologists carrying out their fieldwork in changing societies. The Batak view of kinship presented in the print culture is very much in accord with a common anthropological understanding of kinship as a systemic, social phenomenon. There has been a convergence of Batak folk thought and anthropology. The material presented in this paper suggests that that convergence is at least in part the consequence of the preeminence of literacy in the contemporary world, whether represented by anthropologists or by literate Batak. In studying the Batak peoples today, it would be wise to keep this fact in mind. Just as the Batak print culture in a sense reinterprets Batak kinship in line with its own organizational biases, Western anthropology is also liable to "anthropologize" kinship in these cutures. This is difficult to avoid, as there are many homeland and city Batak ready and willing to offer visiting anthropologists elegantly systematized statements about Batak kinship. In my own fieldwork, I was quickly captured by a pair of elderly, highly literate adat experts, who set out to explain descent, alliance, kin terms, and adat ritual to me in a series of tightly organized "adat lessons." They also took care to have me purchase all the "good" adat books on Batak "culture" that they could find. The danger in this is that anthropologists may in effect simply rediscover their own views of kinship in working with such highly literate informants. The few examples of ritual speech translated in this paper should indicate that the social portrayals of alliance and descent found there may well be of relatively recent authorship. Attention to the full range of a changing oral and literate culture allows outsiders to glimpse some of the full range of folk concepts of kinship, and helps us guard against imposing the intellectual framework of the literate social sciences on a complex and changing Southeast Asian culture.</page><page sequence="17">ORALITY, LITERACY, AND ALLIANCE 449 NOTES 1. These are more accurately termed "adat handbooks." Adat can be roughly translated as "ethnic custom"; in Indonesian cultures today it is often defined in contradistinction to agama (monotheistic religion) and negara (the Indone- sian state). In this period of national moderni- zation, adat in Angkola increasingly focuses on rites of passage and explicit kinship rules. 2. Classically these kinship systems involve patrilineal clans, localized patrilineages, and asymmetrical marriage alliance between these lineages or their subunits. A focal lineage has wife-giving lineages of other clans and wife-re- ceiving lineages. Wife-givers should not receive brides from their taker groups. Men ideally marry MBD. 3. Today many kahanggi are geographically dispersed, with some members living in the home village, some in market towns, and some in multiethnic cities. In addition Angkola adat ("custom") countenances the idea that men may live in their wives' natal villages, although it is recognized as going against the ideal. 4. An extensive bibliography for all the Batak societies is available in Siagian 1966. Kipp and Kipp (1983) provides a recent series of detailed ethnographic essays. Rodgers Siregar (1981b) provides ethnographic background on the Angkola. 5. See Castles (1975) for a discussion of the interaction of the Dutch colonial adminis- tration and Batak political structure in the various ethnic areas. 6. This topic is discussed in Rodgers (1979b), "A Modern Batak Horja: Innovation in Sipirok Adat Ritual." 7. Dalihan na tolu literally means the arrangement of three tall stones on the hearth used for balancing a cookpot. One stone is said to be kahanggi (ego's patrilineage mates), the second stone mom (a wife-giving lineage), and the third stone anakboru (a wife-taking lineage). A pot would tip over if one or more of the stones was misproportioned or out of place; similarly, Angkola society would collapse if one of the three partners to the dalihan na tolu was "out of place" in some way.
