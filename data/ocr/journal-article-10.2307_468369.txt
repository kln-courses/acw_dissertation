<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Observations on Method in Literary Studies D. W. Robertson, Jr. A WORK of literature, or, indeed, a work of architecture, a statue, or a painting is usually approached in either of two ways. It may be presented as a "work of art" embodying elements that appeal more or less spontaneously to the student. Its relevance may be explained on the basis of the insights of the teacher regarding form, structure, and techniques that are thought of as belonging to the province of all art. On the other hand, the student may be led to examine sources, traditions, historical informa- tion of relevance to the work in question, and other matters thought to have a subsidiary value in appreciating the work of art. Roughly, those who employ the first approach are called "critics" while those who employ the second are called "scholars." This difference has led to a great deal of debate.1 To avoid the unpleasantness arising from controversy, and perhaps, with some sense of creating a kind of Hegelian "higher synthesis," many scholars now like to be thought of as "scholar-critics," and critics have in some instances made certain concessions to scholarship. Usually, the "scholar-critic" agrees with the critic that human nature is a constant and that there are qualities of art that may be said to have a universal appeal. The deliberate culti- vation of exotic art, either as "primitive art," or as art from geographi- cally remote places, during the early years of this century, together with an increasing interest in humanity for its own sake, regardless of its specific cultural traditions,2 has given a tremendous impetus to the study of all forms of human expression. Most recently, it has become fashionable to reduce works of art, literary or visual, to their elemen- i At a recent conference of humanistic scholars held at Princeton in connection with the series Humanistic Scholarship in America: The Princeton Studies the divergence between "critics" and "scholars" or their equivalents in a variety of fields became surprisingly evident. The "critics" seem in general to have fared better than the "scholars" on this occasion. 2 For an interesting discussion of this phenomenon, see Luis Diez del Corral, The Rape of Europe (New York, 1959), esp. Ch. vii.</page><page sequence="2">22 NEW LITERARY HISTORY tary structures, regardless of content. These structures are felt to be somehow valuable in themselves, especially as "aesthetic" manifesta- tions of a kind of universal human reality. There is some evidence of a growing uneasiness with this posture. In the first place, an ingrained historical optimism has led many persons to assume that privileged men of the past "transcend" their time in such a way that they are able to "look forward" to ideas and attitudes we now think of as being more or less self-evident. The scholar has frequently adjusted his "history" in such a way as to make possible accolades of "great artists" in the past as prophets, and the critic has welcomed such interpretations as confirmation of universal human realities. Each new critical school has been quick to adopt all the more admirable artists of the past as worthy predecessors of its own views and attitudes. However, rapid changes in attitude since the early years of this century, in spite of the continuity of a certain substratum of opinion, make it clear that what was "self-evident" in 1920 is no longer "self-evident" today. Are the attitudes "self-evident" to Chaucer, Shakespeare, or Pope the attitudes of 1920 or those of 1968? It is clear that they cannot be both, and it is increasingly obvious that they cannot be either, and that, moreover, Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Pope did not share the same attitudes. Meanwhile, we have learned a great deal since 1920o about history, so that much of the historical reconstruction of the scholar-critics of a generation ago now seems naive and factually unacceptable. Not only that, but "aesthetic" ideas have changed as well, so that what appeared to be "universal art" in 1920 must now be made "universal" on quite other grounds, if, indeed, it is possible to formulate any such grounds at all. Perhaps the first coherent solution to the problem was that advanced by historians of the visual arts, who have developed, chiefly under the guidance of Heinrich W6lfflin, a concept of "stylistic history."3 The aims of stylistic history were at first rather modest: to study changing modes of apprehending the visual world. However, it was realized at the outset that these modes of vision imply "the bases of the whole world picture of a people," and it has become apparent that stylistic history does not lose its validity when the visual arts themselves abandon the "visual world" as it is ordinarily understood entirely. It became clear that what is "good" in terms of one artistic style is not necessarily "good" in terms of another, and, further, that each style representing the tastes of a given population at a given time has an appeal peculiar to certain specific attitudes and ideals, which are much more "basic" than the visual styles seem to be when we regard them 3 W61ffiin's seminal study, available in English as Principles of Art History, was first published in 1915-</page><page sequence="3">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON METHOD IN LITERARY STUDIES 23 in isolation from their cultural contexts. In so far as literary studies are concerned, various efforts have been made to demonstrate parallels between styles in the visual arts and styles in literature, but since the whole subject of stylistic history is still new, and since appropriate descriptions of specific stylistic periods are not always available, a great deal of work still needs to be done.4 A new impetus to sharper historical perspectives has arisen in two disciplines unrelated to art history. The fact that these disciplines seem at first unrelated to literary studies should not deter us from paying careful attention to their conclusions, since these conclusions will undoubtedly exert a profound effect on such studies in the future. In the first place, certain psychologists, who belong, roughly, to the "phenomenological school" in Europe, most notably Dr. J. H. van den Berg,5 have developed a concept of "psychological history." Much of their work has a very sound basis in observation, and it is by no means necessary to be a disciple of Husserl in order to appreciate the value of some their conclusions. Having observed that different social struc- tures in the modern world profoundly affect the psychic constitutions of those who participate in them, these psychiatrists have reached the very plausible conclusion that historical changes in social structure produce marked alterations in "human nature." That is, "human nature" in one kind of social environment is likely to be very different from "human nature" in a second social environment differing signi- ficantly in structure from the first. This general conclusion has already influenced a number of historical studies.6 Techniques for employing it vary among scholars, and the results have not always been convinc- ing. Nevertheless, it is evident that the idea, here stated only in a very simple form, has enormous possibilities for development, and that its disciplined application will profoundly affect our attitudes toward the literature of the past. Beginning with far different assumptions, largely derived from 4 No adequate history of the Baroque style is as yet available. For the Rococo, there are suggestive observations in Arno Sch6nberger and Halldor Soehner, The Rococo Age (New York, 196o). Literary materials are used effectively in connection with the nineteenth century by Werner Hofmann, The Earthly Paradise (New York, 1961). Efforts to distinguish the effects of Romanesque and Gothic styles in literature appear in Paul Zumthor, Langue et techniques podtiques a l'dpoque romane (Paris, 1963), and in the present author's A Preface to Chaucer (Princeton, 1962). There are highly suggestive materials in the recent works of Marshall McLuhan. 5 Dr. van den Berg's most famous work, The Changing Nature of Man, is available in English (New York, 1961). Certain of his other studies, notably Het menselijk lichaam (Nijkerk, 1959), are also relevant. 6 See the review article by R. van Caenegem, "Psychologische Geschiedenis," Tijdschrift voor Geschiedenis, LXXVIII (1965), 129-149.</page><page sequence="4">24 NEW LITERARY HISTORY theories of "structural linguistics" first announced in Prague in 1928, anthropologists like Professor Livi-Strauss and philosophers like Michel Foucault,7 have sought to show that careful "synchronic" studies, or studies in depth of a given culture at a given time reveal adequate and reasonable "universes of discourse" suited to the struc- tures of earlier or more primitive societies that should not be naively criticized from the point of view of our own, and, at the same time, that historical change is something far more complex than we had ordinarily assumed it to be. Again, the results of these studies may be appreciated even by those who do not share all of the assumptions upon which they are constructed. That is, the conclusions are not necessarily offensive to linguists trained in the school of the "Young Grammarians" who have learned to reverence scholars like Streitberg, Meillet, and Kieckers. The new studies have shown that a given idea or institution may play a far different r6le in one society than it does in one immediately preceding it or in one immediately following it in time. This fact becomes more apparent when a society is viewed as a "system," not, that is, as a rigorous artificial structure, but as an integrated whole in which the various "parts" are sufficiently inter- dependent so that a change in one implies concomitant changes in all the others. The metaphor "organic structure" has sometimes been used in this connection, but, although it may be revealing and helpful, it should be considered as a tool rather than as a descriptive epithet. Perhaps it is significant that these ideas are contemporary with "systems analysis" as it has been developed in other fields. In any event, the old attitude toward the "history of ideas" frequently oversimplifies or distorts the actual situation before us in the historical evidence, since it tends to neglect the shifting position of the ideas being studied within the social structure as a whole. Disturbed by the usual naivete of diachronic studies in this respect, Professor Foucault has developed a concept of historical "archaeol- ogy." That is, he has set out to show, specifically on the basis of atti- tudes toward language and money, that a substratum of common assumptions underlies apparently divergent opinions set forth contem- poraneously in a given society, and that this substratum undergoes radical shifts at certain periods in the course of history. Although 7 For a brief account of the early development of structural linguistics, see Emile Benveniste, Probldmes de linguistique gdndrale (Paris, 1966), Ch. viii. Professor LUvi-Strauss is best known to English readers for The Savage Mind (Chicago, 1966). The book reveals a fondness for outmoded Marxist polarities and is tinged with romantic neo-primitivism. Its author dislikes stylistic history. Nevertheless, some of the results are extremely useful. Foucault's relevant work is Les mots et les choses (Paris, 1966). His earlier work on madness tends to be sensationalistic and the scholarship is unreliable.</page><page sequence="5">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON METHOD IN LITERARY STUDIES 25 the evidence adduced is sometimes rather fragmentary, especially in the treatment of the Renaissance, and Professor Foucault is not always aware of the background of some of the ideas he adduces (like that, for example, of convenientia), the results are extremely impressive in a general way. He makes it obvious that "truths" concerning lan- guage and money in the nineteenth century are not the "truths" concerning these matters in earlier societies, and that we have no justification for projecting nineteenth-century "truths" about these matters on the Baroque or Renaissance past. Meanwhile, although he did not employ the evidence of stylistic history in any systematic way, the "periods," or chronological divisions of relative stability in the substratum of thought, that he proposes are roughly the same as those used by stylistic historians in the study of the visual arts. At the same time, with minor exceptions, they are generally consonant with con- clusions we should expect from studies in "psychological history." That is, scholars interested in stylistic changes, alterations in "human nature," and shifts in the substratum of thought are occupied with what are essentially similar phenomena. In this connection, it is highly significant that similar conclusions have been reached on the basis of very different kinds of premises and working methods. It is obvious that, leaving aside all quarrels about premises, definitions, and other features of what might be called the tools of investigation, we shall, in the future, need to be much more thorough in our synchronic studies of cultural structures in the past. The integrity of past struc- tures must be respected, and histories of isolated classes of phenomena must be written with a careful eye to the shifting position of those phenomena within the structures that produce them. Above all, it seems obvious that we shall need to exhibit far greater reluctance than we have usually shown to impose our own formulations about ideas and institutions on the structures of the past as though they were uni- versal truths.8 Perhaps the key to any helpful understanding of earlier cultural structures is the realization that human formulations and institutions, including our own, are contingent phenomena without any inde- pendent reality of their own. For example, language exists only in the 8 In 195o in "Historical Criticism," English Institute Essays, z95o (New York, 1951), I wrote that the historical critic "looks with some apprehension on the tendency of the literary critic to regard older literature in the light of modern aesthetic systems, economic philosophies, or psychological theories. He feels that such systems . . . do not exist until they are formulated." This statement was inspired by a reaction to some remarks by P. W. Bridgman in The Nature of Physical Theory (Princeton, 1936), and was felt to be harmonious with views acceptable in the field of "general semantics," a subject that was then popular. However, the statement has frequently been deplored. I have not abandoned it, and the present essay may serve to make it more comprehensible.</page><page sequence="6">26 NEW LITERARY HISTORY presence of one human being addressing either another human being, himself as though he were another human being, or an imaginary audience, including any inanimate objects to which he may choose to speak. It has no reality beyond one of these situations, and it has no "nature" independent of the nature imposed on it by the speaker and his audience, real or imaginary. The sounds that are the vehicle for language do not constitute its nature, since they have no signi- ficance as language except by virtue of a common understanding between the speaker and his audience, real or imaginary. If, as the psychological historians insist, human nature undergoes changes, it is clear that language must undergo changes also, not only of the kind usually discussed under the heading "linguistic change," but also more profound changes in its nature. Again, the nature of language in one society may be quite different from its nature in another society. In connection with this last consideration, Foucault seeks to show that Baroque language was essentially "representation," but that in the nineteenth century language became "expression." The only sane answer to the question as to whether language is "representation" or is "expression" must be that language was "representation" for speakers during the Baroque period and was "expression" for speakers during the nineteenth century. To say that language is expression and has always been expression, or, as more recent linguists are likely to say, language is "a system that embodies a reproduction of reality" is to posit an independent existence and nature for something merely contingent. It is also true that the assumption of any absolute stand on the nature of language will inevitably prevent us from understand- ing the language of the past as it survives in literary and other docu- ments. This is not to say that formulations of the kind "Language is a system" are not useful. They may be very useful indeed so long as they are regarded as tools and not as absolutes. But in our studies of Chaucer, Shakespeare, or Pope (each of whom used a language appro- priate to his time and place), we should constantly keep before us the fact that the language employed by any one one of them is not "the same thing" as the language we employ today. The tendency to read literary texts from the pre-nineteenth-century past as though the language in which they were written was essentially "expression" has given rise to enormous distortions in our criticism. This caution concerning language should be extended to other ideas and institutions as well. For example, the Oxford neo-positivists have frequently adduced ideas from Hume, Kant, Hegel or other earlier philosophers as though those philosophers were writing today. This procedure simply fails to recognize the fact that a statement by Hume means quite a different thing taken in isolation today from what it meant in the context of the society to which Hume addressed</page><page sequence="7">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON METHOD IN LITERARY STUDIES 27 himself. What is worse, the same neo-positivists have not infrequently subjected the terms used by earlier philosophers to semantic analysis in an effort to show that they are meaningless. It may be quite true that a term used by Hume or Kant has little meaning in the stylistic environment in which we move, but this does not imply that the term was meaningless at the time it was used. That is, a statement may be valid at one time and meaningless at another. Again, as I have sought to show elsewhere, the system of "principal vices" popular during the late Middle Ages may be largely irrelevant in the society of today, but it played a functional part in medieval society, where it had a genuine operational validity.9 The same kind of considerations apply to more complex institutions like marriage. It is obvious that the institution of marriage plays an entirely different part in our society with its egalitarian ideals, where the sacramental value of the contract is usually merely formal and its function is largely personal, from that it played in an hierarchical society organized in small groups like that of the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, scholars have not hesitated to attribute "modern" attitudes toward marriage to Chaucer, who lived in a society where such attitudes would have been absurd.10 The initial assumption that marriage is "the same thing" in the fourteenth century as it is today is, of course, erroneous. Generally, the categories by means of which we analyze our own society may sometimes appear in earlier societies. When such coinci- dences occur, as they do in the examples cited above, we should be willing to recognize the fact that their significance in the past may be very different from their significance in the present, and, moreover, that their significance in the present will undoubtedly change in the future with changes in the structure of society and concomitant altera- tions in "human nature." That is, unless we take into account changes in the positions of institutions within the social structure in the course of time, our studies of subjects like "the history of marriage" are bound to be misleading. The common assumption that institutions, attitudes, and ideals display a "linear development" in the course of history has no justification in the evidence of history itself. And the further assumption that the present represents a kind of glorious fruition of linear developments amounts to nothing more than what might with some justice be called "historical anthropomorphism" inherited from romantic philosophers like Hegel. In addition to preserving old categories, but in altered form, new 9 Chaucer's London (New York, 1968), pp. 5-8, 68-69, 218-20. io The claim for Chaucer's "modernity" in this respect is usually made in connec- tion with "The Franklin's Tale." But as I shall seek to show in a forthcoming article this interpretation rests on dubious premises.</page><page sequence="8">28 NEW LITERARY HISTORY societies construct new categories of their own. These new formula- tions are likely to appear in fairly large numbers at about the same time, and their appearance on a large scale is accompanied by "changes in style," or "changes in human nature," or, to put it in another way, "changes in the substratum of thought." Such changes occurred, for example, in the mid-twelfth century, in the fifteenth century, in the early seventeenth century, in the later eighteenth century, and at the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is possible, of course, and sometimes desirable to subdivide the "periods" thus established still further. Sometimes these periods coincide with periods of linguistic change as such change is described by historical linguists, although the significance of this coincidence has never been explored. The new categories developed during these periods of change are concomitant with changes in social structure and have little relevance to social structures preceding them. For example, the later eighteenth century developed a concept of "art" and "the artist" that has been continued and modified since. But neither the eighteenth-century concept nor its subsequent modifications have any relevance to earlier societies where "art" meant something entirely different and where the "artist" in the eighteenth-century sense did not exist. Thus for example, one student of the Gothic cathedral has seen fit to explain at some length that the cathedrals do not constitute what we call "art."" The same period witnessed the development of an idea of "personality," which was deepened and strengthened in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but this, too, was an idea suited to life within a new kind of social structure without relevance to life as it was lived in earlier centuries.12 The usual assumption that "art" as we understand it, or "personality" has "always existed" even though people did not "talk about it" in earlier times makes an unwarranted universalization of purely contingent phenomena. In general, new categories should not be imposed on the past. Freudian psychology, for example, represents a series of generaliza- tions based on the effects of a kind of social structure that developed during the course of the later nineteenth century. The relevant social conditions together with certain concomitant attitudes toward sex did not exist in the eighteenth century, and are now rapidly disappearing. Hence efforts to analyze earlier cultural phenomena in Freudian terms inevitably lead to false conclusions. This is not to say that Freudian psychology is or was "wrong," but simply that its truths have a date and locale attached to them. To put this in another way, Freudian psychology is a part of a "universe of discourse" with a ii See Jean Gimpel, The Cathedral Builders (New York, 1961), pp. 95-97- 12 Cf. Chaucer's London, pp. 5-7.</page><page sequence="9">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON METHOD IN LITERARY STUDIES 29 nexus of relationships to other elements in that "universe." To insert it into an earlier universe of discourse where no such nexus exists is to create absurdities. That is, Freudian "complexes" have about as much place in discussions of Shakespeare as have carburetors or semi- conductors. It cannot be emphasized too urgently that any age in the past can be understood only when we analyze it in so far as is possible in its own terms. If we can begin to understand those terms in their own context, we can begin to understand the age, but if we impose our own terms on it, we might as well be studying ourselves rather than the past. Changes in the structure of society and the nature of language fre- quently imply changes in very basic attitudes toward reality, toward the location of reality, and toward its relation to space and time.13 Since the early nineteenth century, for example, there has been a very marked tendency to locate reality within the individual. Croce's "intuition," Ortega y Gasset's position that "Reality is my life," and Bishop Robinson's desire to locate God "in the depths of the person- ality," to cite only a few random examples, are all manifestations of a common "stylistic" or "archaeologically discernible" mode that is a more or less natural concomitant of a society in which the individual is isolated in a complex of large group structures. This mode, with its emphasis on inner reality, is at the same time conducive to expression- istic attitudes toward thought, language, and art, to subjective evalua- tions of space, and to a mistrust of the "past" and the "future."'4 But to impose various facets of this mode or its logically felt conse- quences on the past, as though it were generally characteristic of all humanity, is to invite serious misapprehensions concerning both our- selves and our ancestors. In the course of the above discussion I have used "the past" simply as a convenient expression. Actually, we know very little about the past beyond the dubious evidence of our memories, which are always colored by the present. What we as students have before us instead of the past itself is a series of monuments, artifacts, and documents exist- ing in the present, which are just as much a part of the present as are automobiles, neutrons, or cola beverages. The historian or the student of literature concerns himself with the order and significance of the 13 For changing attitudes toward time, see Georges Poulet, Studies in Human Time (New York, 1959). There are useful observations in Foucault, and in some of the writings of stylistic historians. Historians of the visual arts frequently treat changing attitudes toward space. 14 Modern thinkers often seek to objectify what are essentially subjective evalua- tions of space, as Heidegger does in Being and Time (New York, 1962). On attitudes toward the past and the future, cf. Hofmann, The Earthly Paradise, p. 5o, and Chaucer's London, p. 120.</page><page sequence="10">30 NEW LITERARY HISTORY detritus of the past in the present, not with the past itself, which is unapproachable. The works of Chaucer, or Shakespeare, or Milton exist today in libraries, in homes, or in the rooms of students. Why not treat them as though they were written within our own genera- tion? The critic, or even the scholar-critic, often shows a marked inclination to do this, either by stating, in terms of some currently fashionable critical doctrine, that great art is universal, or by seeking to interpret the evidence of the past in such a way as to make it conform to the conventions of the present. If modern audiences cannot appreciate the music of Bach played in a Baroque manner on Baroque instruments, why not present symphonic arrangements of Bach that make Bach sound like Tchaikowsky? There are a number of valid answers to this question, some of them quite simple. To begin with a simple one, it is fairly obvious that Tchaikowsky wrote much better music in his own style than Bach could, and that the efforts of an arranger of Bach are unlikely to equal the efforts of Tchaikowsky himself. If one wishes to listen to music in the style of Tchaikowsky, he would do much better to listen to Tchaikowsky's own compositions. The idea that Bach's music trans- formed for a modern symphony orchestra has a "cultural value" is, therefore, specious. Moreover, the unpleasant prospect looms that we shall some day hear Bach in the style of Webern, or the later Stravin- sky, or even Stockhausen, as Bach keeps up with the times. Much the same criticisms may be made of Chaucer, or Shakespeare, or Milton transformed in the classroom into "modern" authors. They are less good at their newly imposed task than are modern authors themselves, and their "cultural" value becomes negligible. More seriously, the literary critic who customarily employs tools first created during the romantic movement now modified by Crocean aesthetics in its various modern forms, frequently commits historical blunders that are obvious to persons of no very great sophistication.15 Crocean aesthetics is, actually, little more than a rationalization of the expressionistic style which seeks to turn all art into a lyrical expression of intuitively recognized inner truths. Although it is well suited to works produced in this style, it has no relevance to earlier styles consonant with social structures wherein the conditions necessary to produce expressionistic attitudes did not exist. If we are to compose valid criticism of works produced in earlier stylistic periods, we must do so in terms of conven- tions established at a time contemporary with the works themselves. If we fail to do so, we shall miss the integrity of the works we study, 15 The romantic origin of the fundamental attitudes of modern criticism has been amply demonstrated by M. H. Abrams in The Mirror and the Lamp (New York, 1958).</page><page sequence="11">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON METHOD IN LITERARY STUDIES 31 not to mention their significance, frequently profound, for their original audiences. What we call the past is, in effect, a series of foreign countries inhabited by strangers whose manners, customs, tastes, and basic attitudes even partially understood widen our horizons and enrich our daily experience. Concealed self-study through the inadequate medium of the past only stultifies us within the narrow confines of our own naively envisioned perspectives. The specious and easy "rele- vance" achieved by positing "universal humanity" and then imposing our own prejudices on the past is not merely detrimental to under- standing. It will soon become absurd in the light of a growing aware- ness of the complexity of historical processes. Finally, it is barely possible that the recognition of valid realities established by earlier generations may lead us at least one small step away from that rancid solipsistic pit into which the major tendencies of post-romantic thought have thrust us.16 Specifically, there are a number of ways in which literary studies might well be improved in the light of the above considerations. In the first place, the usual "diachronic" courses now offered in colleges and universities - courses in the history of the epic, the drama, the lyric, or other "genre" histories - should be recognized as being extremely artificial and misleading. The "lyric" is one thing in the thirteenth century and quite another in the nineteenth century. To present students with a "definition" of the lyric and then study its "history" from the thirteenth century to the present is to engage in a completely artificial exercise that has almost no educational value except that accidentally achieved by the presentation of occasional works that one student or another may, for a short time, enjoy. Similarly, to concoct a "definition" of tragedy, an exercise for which Aristotle offers an unfortunate precedent, and then to make all "trage- dies" - Greek, Elizabethan, romantic, and modern - conform to the definition is not only to limit the understanding of the student but to distort the evidence of the past within a framework that has no intellectual respectability. If we are to make literary courses significant, genuinely stimulating, and indeed comparable in sophistication with courses now being offered by some historians of the visual arts, we shall need to emphasize "period" and "author" courses a great deal i6 The fact that empirical attitudes, for all their vaunted objectivity, imply the reality of the nervous system of the observer rather than that of anything observed is more often felt than faced squarely. The emphasis on the inner reality of the artist in modern art needs no special elaboration, since it is fairly obvious. However, for significant observations on the subject, see, for example, Wallace Fowlie, The Age of Surrealism (Bloomington, 196o), pp. 29-30; Marcel Brion, Art abstrait (Paris, 1956), pp. 25, 27, 93-94, 139.</page><page sequence="12">32 NEW LITERARY HISTORY more, and to enrich these courses with more thorough and intellectu- ally respectable considerations of relevant monuments from the visual arts, with descriptions of social institutions, and with efforts to eval- uate the works being studied in a way that would have been compre- hensible to their authors and their original audiences. The usual "genre" courses do not provide sufficient time for the development of an adequate background in the various styles encountered. Diachronic studies of relatively brief periods in detail can be extremely helpful, since they reveal the gradual changes in attitude that culminate in more pronounced changes in style. However, such studies should not assume any kind of "progress" except that in time. As social institutions change there are concomitant changes in thought, language, and ideals, as well as changes in style. But these changes are better regarded as adaptations within a system than as illustrations of linear progress. Ideas and forms of expression appro- priate to a later generation are not necessarily appropriate to an earlier generation, so that there are little grounds for thinking of them as "improvements." But such studies can show very clearly the interaction of various elements in a society that accompany changes in literary conventions. Studies of more extensive periods broken by major stylistic shifts, like the eighteenth century, for example, can serve to illustrate the kind of dramatic contrasts that may appear in the juxtaposition of two very different styles. Undergraduate "survey" courses afford a striking opportunity to present in a simplified fashion the integrity of various stylistic conventions and at the same time to clarify the essential peculiarities of the stylistic modes to which we are accustomed today. But in order to be effective, such courses need to concentrate on a few selected literary texts and to make far more use of the visual arts, music, and relevant historical sociology. Stylistic features are frequently more apparent in the visual arts than they are in literature, since it is always possible to read a text naively in terms of one's own stylistic attitudes. All this implies, of course, a new professionalism in graduate train- ing. Too frequently graduate students today are treated as though they were potential poets or novelists whose "sensibilities" need culti- vating. There is undoubtedly a place for creative arts courses in a modern university, and certainly no one objects to cultivated sensi- bilities. However, if graduate schools in English are to be profession- ally effective, they must provide a more thorough grounding in period studies, with emphasis on primary sources in variety, and the cultiva- tion of the kind of imagination that involves skepticism concerning accepted secondary formulations, the ability to see new relationships among primary materials, and the impulse to formulate relevant rela- tionships between those materials and literary texts. The old system</page><page sequence="13">SOME OBSERVATIONS ON METHOD IN LITERARY STUDIES 33 that required little more than the learning of a long series of secondary conclusions by rote, regardless of their value, is now long out of date, and its futility is obvious, even to the students themselves. It has led to academic conservatism of a most undesirable kind and to the unthinking repetition and transmission of outmoded generalizations on a large scale. Literary scholars must learn to welcome the prospect of new approaches and new ideas. At present no group of university men is more resistant to change or more antagonistic to new develop- ments that do not serve to confirm attitudes previously learned than that made up of teachers of what are called the humanities. The task of understanding a literary text from an earlier generation as it was initially presented is formidable. We cannot, on the basis of the evidence available reconstruct completely any period in the past, and our understanding will always be impeded to a certain extent by the conventions of our own times, which change continuously, but from which no one can escape entirely. But this fact should act as a stimulus rather than as a deterrent, since it means that there will always be something more to be done. The frontiers before us have no limit. And we may be consoled by the fact that the more accurately we can describe the detritus left to us by the past, the better able we shall be to understand ourselves. And if the "humanities" - a nine- teenth-century invention - can help us in this task, they will serve a useful and beneficial function in our society. Meanwhile, the realiza- tion that our own attitudes are, like those of the past, largely contin- gent may help to induce a certain equanimity and detachment. If literary studies are divorced from the larger concerns of cultural his- tory they will eventually wither away. PRINCETON UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
