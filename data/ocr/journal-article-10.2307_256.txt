<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMUNICATION Veblen Not an Institutional Economist "An Appraisal of Institutional Economics" by Paul T. Homan, published in the March, 1932, number of the Review, may or may not have put an end to the use of the term "institutional economics" in economic discussions. In any event, his article presents implications which will not be accepted by all of those whom he finds not to be institutionalists. No objection can be found with much of what Professor Homan says. I would agree that the term "institutional economist" does not mean any- thing sufficiently definite to be a serviceable designation of any individual or group of individuals. And especially is it a misnomer when applied to the late Professor Thorstein Veblen, notwithstanding Professor Homan's partial approval of the view that Veblen is the one and only institutional economist. Whether or not it is his intention to do so, Professor Homan effectively identifies Veblen with the term institutional economics. His judgment is that all the so-called institutionalists, "with the possible exception of Professor Commons," are "legatees of Veblen's thinking." And when he comes toward the close of his article to a happy burial of the "current controversy between a posited institutional economics and a posited neo-classical economics," he finds the roots of the controversy going back to "an absurd anti-rationalism and an equally absurd and satisfied traditionalism." One gets the impression that Veblen and the "few thin essays, critical, hortatory and hopeful," writ- ten or inspired by him, have been wrapped in the burial garments of the afore- said controversy and with it have been "consigned to the lower regions with- out sorrow. It was the implication that Veblen's work was fundamentally anti-rational whieh is mainly responsible for this comment on Professor Homan's article. Such a view strikes me as deserving epithets almost as harsh as those which Professor Homan applied to the above-mentioned controversy. Equally prominent with the association of institutional economics and the name of Veblen in Professor Homan's article is the contention that there is no such thing as institutional economics because there is no body of system- atic theory to which the name can be applied. By systematic theory is meant, apparently, something comparable to theories of value and distribution in a competitive economic system. However, at one point in his discussion, Pro- fessor Hornan says that fifteen years ago institutional economics was a faith that "an adequate organon of economic thought could be achieved by the ac- cumulation of data and analysis of them in terms of an evolutionary process." Now, after the passage of fifteen years, Professor Homan demands a trans- formation of this earlier faith into works. And the works must be so effective as to produce not only a new economic organon but also a new body of theory in a span of fifteen years. If those who subscribed to the faith fifteen years ago demanded any such results, their faith was not comparable even to the proverbial mustard seed. In view of the fact that the essential features of a competitive system were present in England something like two hundred years before the development of a body of systematic theory of competitive economics, Professor Homan should be more patient. Can it be that his impatience over a lack of satisfac- tory accomplishments in fifteen years is a result of a long established habit of thinking in static terms? He asserts that no one questions the dependence</page><page sequence="2">1933] Veblen Not an Institutional Economist 275 of current economic organization upon our cultural past, and adds: "But the task of developing it as a part of economic literature or theory faces a void both of language and of method, a void commonly jumped by the 'historical introduction'." He evidently recoils from the plunge into such a void. Putting the argument as Veblen himself would have put it, where would the physical and biological sciences be now if scientists in those fields had re- coiled from problems which lay outside of prevailing terms, concepts and technique of procedure? And the answer is that they would find themselves in precisely the position which economics will occupy if economists content themselves with such a continued juggling of accepted terms, concepts and theories as is implied by Professor Homan. In his closing paragraphs, Professor Homan draws a happy picture that is almost like a bit of Victorian fiction. In it the clouds of controversy have cleared away: economists are busy at their varied and important tasks, and there is no definable schism of institutional versus other economics to mar the "common goal of economics in its aspects of problems, methods and gen- eralized knowledge." In reading those paragraphs, I could not help smil- ing at the thought of the amusement which they would have afforded Veblen. Because his writings were so generally critical of current economic theory and current economic organization, Veblen appears to have left the impres- sion that his thinking was not systematic or mechanistie and even that it was anti-rational. This impression, no doubt, is in part responsible for his designa- tion as an institutionalist. It is true that Veblen scouted the alleged mechanism of equilibrium eco- nomics, to which variety of economic theory Professor Homan seems to ac- cord a monopoly of meehanistic thinking in his ironical reference to "the benighted days of mechanistic thinking." Veblen's thinking ran in terms of a different mechanism; a mechanism which rested squarely upon a deterministic philosophy. Nevertheless, it was mechanistic. In his scheme of thinking, in- stitutions were by-products rather than central objects of attention. For ex- ample, when he pointed out the change in the fundamental theory of property which came with the cultural change from the Middle Ages to the in- dividualistic or natural rights period, he was not interested in giving an account of the evolution of the theory of property but rather he was using an effect upon a particular institution to show a more general change in habits of thought; a shift in social philosophy. And in accounting for this change of bias, or point of view, or philosophy, lying below the level of institutional organization, he was influenced largely by the theory of tech- nological determination of Karl Marx. Veblen was fond of contrasting methods of economics with those of the physical and biological sciences. He delighted in pointing out ways in which the current system of economic control obviously runs counter to the material well being of society. His particular aversions were orthodox economic theory, war, religion, politics and business enterprise. He thoroughly distrusted any- thing which ran in subjective, spiritual or teleological terms. One of his prime favorites among terms was "anthropomorphism." In pointing out that modern science and the maehine process seem to be destroying all that is "respectable, noble and dignified in human intercourse and ideals," his ap- proval of the destruction was one hundred per cent. He held that the cur- rent scheme of dominant institutions was not to be salvaged but sloughed off.</page><page sequence="3">276 Communicatimn [June Professor H. J. Davenport on several occasions expressed regret that Veblen did not undertake to be constructive. And by constructive, I take it, he meant the formulation of something in the way of either a develop- ment of the existing system of economic control or a comprehensive scheme of control to take its place. However, in Veblen's view, economic systems made by economists had no validity. He unquestionably would have held that he was as constructive as a geologist or a physicist and that he could not be more so without violating the fundamental bases of his thinking. And I venture to say that he adhered to his basic postulates as rigidly as did the classical economists themselves. In reading Veblen's criticisms of the currently dominant scheme of in- stitutions, one is impressed with the idea that he thought the system served no useful purpose and was a serious handicap: or at best that it was a matter of vestigial survival. If it could only be swept away nothing would need to be put in its place. A similar impression is to be drawn from not a few socialist writers. In Veblen's case, at least, this view is not merely short sightedness. It follows from his general theoretical position. In mak- ing a distinction between business and industry; between traditional forms of control and an underlying technological organization of industry, he felt that the technological organization was essentially a new economic organization. To him the use of natural resources to feed, clothe and shelter the human race presented itself as a scientific or technological problem. With the sloughing off of prevailing business control, there would of course be neces- sary some expansion of technological organization in the way of cooirdinat- ing machinery, but that would be set up in accordance with the scientific basis of industry-a sort of scientific management. In attempting to appraise the work of Veblen, it is important, I think, to remember that he came to economics through the field of philosophy. His philosophic thinking was shaped in the days before scientists had demon- strated effectively the essentially intangible character of the physical world: when the contrasts between physical and non-physical (in a common-sense view) and between material and spiritual were still useful instruments of thought. In the midst of a prevalence of dualism, he revolted against the idea that spiritual insight led to a higher order of truth or reality. If the choice was to be one between appearance and reality he chose to find reality in the matter of fact knowledge of science. His philosophical bias became that of a materialistic monist. He was too clear a thinker to find anything absolute in the technique or conclusions of science but nevertheless his materialistic bias remained with him. Matter of fact knowledge was for him matter of fact. His literary tools of irony, humor and ridicule serve as a cloak not for the detachment of a cynic but for the zeal of a crusader fighting to ad- vance the cause of his philosophy; striving to bring men back to faith in their common senses, and this in spite of the fact that the very notion of things like zeal and crusading was distasteful to him in the extreme. Like other zeal- ots Veblen did not recognize it as zeal but only as an inescapable recognition of the truth. Delaisi has written a suggestive and stimulating book on Political Myths and Economic Realities. The title does imply a realism in economics which is spurious but that is beside the point. The discussion shows how certain con- cepts or ideas have become so prevalent as to serve as standards or ideals in shaping the habits of thought of the men of given periods. Such for ex- ample were the concepts of the Holy Roman Empire and of the political</page><page sequence="4">1933] Veblen Not an Institutional Eco-nomist 277 democracy of a later date. To these transitory ideals Delaisi gives the name of myth. Such myths, of course, are not confined to political affairs. In fact political democracy is only a special form in the political field of the general myth of individual liberty. Delaisi might well have gone further than he did by pointing out the cur- rently dominant myth, the myth of science which is making headway now even in the field of government. Veblen was above all else a prophet of this new myth. And the fact that our notions of science continue to change does not make this statement any less true. It is too early to say what will be the future significance of his work. If the prestige of science proves to be a passing fad with no great cultural significance, Veblen may rank only as a clever essayist with a unique vocabulary. But if science becomes a major myth, as it gives every promise of doing, he will be placed in the position of a social philosopher of the first magnitude. To call him an institutional econ- omist would emphasize an incidental aspect of his work rather than char- acterize its essential features. I may add in closing that I have found the writings of Professor Homan always stimulating: this article no less than others but in a somewhat dif- ferent way. D. R.
