<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIAKTOROS ARGEIPHONTES JACQUELINE CHITTENDEN PLATE II G REEK and Minoan strains are mingled in the Homeric Hermes. He is, moreover, a being of many facets who gives promise of greater complexity in time to come. Some of these facets shine more brightly than others: for example, Homeric epic depicts him more plainly as a thief than as either herald or guide to the dead, although the two latter functions increase in importance during subsequent centuries. While there is not a single trace of any phallic aspect, very conspicuous are his two functions of pastoral god and of guide to travellers. The first of these can, I think, be traced to a simple Minoan beginning; the second is traceable to the incoming Greeks who, knowing stone heaps also, perhaps as- sociated them with a wayfarer's god, and who perhaps added Minoan ideas to their own after they had encountered the Minoan god. That the Minoan Master of Animals-who apparently was a stone heap god -became a patron deity of shepherds is clear from certain Minoan gems, and from the votive offerings in the Patsos cave where there was discovered also a terracotta head of a round-eyed deity crowned with a headdress like the one worn by the Master of Animals on a broken gem. The reason why shepherds invoked the master of wild creatures is not far to seek: the same reason would extend to travellers in a country both strange and dangerous. Protection is sought by shepherd and traveller alike, and it is this very protective aspect together with the powers implied by it which Hermes, the pastoral god, shares with Hermes, the Guide. Hermes, too, possessed power over animals; he succeeded the Minoan god as lord of the Patsos cave; the cults of both were connected with stone heaps; both were invoked by hunters; in fact, the points of correspondence be- tween the two are so numerous that it is safe to consider, on one hand, that the Hermes of history took many of his traits from a Minoan god; on the other, that he was endowed with a Greek name and certain mature as well as nascent Greek traits.' This article aims at considering Hermes' two most important epithets2 and their relation- ship with his two chief functions in epic literature. It will also weary the shade of Homer by adding to the host already written yet one more analysis of his lovely Circe story. Hermes is frequently referred to by Homer as b&amp;dKTopOS 'ApyE0L6vr-qs only, his "proper name" being omitted. These two epithets most often occur juxtaposed with one another although each one can be found occasionally with another word,3 and, in rare cases, each 1 must thank Professor M. P. Nilsson who, in a letter, urged caution on me with respect to the stone heap which was, of course, and still is, a feature of Northern European belief.

It designates Hermes twenty- seven times, fourteen times in the Iliad and thirteen in the Odyssey.5 The traditional meaning of Argeiphontes is "Slayer of Argus." Homer does not relate the legend which tells that Hermes slew Argus to liberate the imprisoned Io, but Hesiod apparently did, in a poem now lost to us.6 There is no occasion for Homer to tell the story, but because he is silent about it Aristarchus thought it was a legend unknown to him and invented later. There have been many attempts to prove that Homer means something different by it. Some think its Homeric meaning is "the Serpent Slayer," others, "the brightly shining," depending entirely on the translation of apyds which is treated as an adjective, and qbvr-s the meaning and derivation of which are disputed.' Preller and Kretschmer adhere to the traditional view.8 The latter has satisfactorily explained the vowel change from o to -EL, drawn attention to the analogous avapc/bvr-s and has thereby removed any serious philological difficulty. But there are other points to be considered. Hesiod was not the only early Greek who knew the story. The slaying of Argus is depicted on a vase of Ionian Greek workmanship now in Munich (pl. II, 12), and on early Attic red figure pots.' In the fifth century Xanthus referred to it when relating an aetiological legend.'0 These early sources strongly support Kretschmer's opinion that the traditional interpretation of the epithet be maintained. Cook is probably right in thinking that "Diaktoros Argeiphontes" is pre-homeric.11 Argeiphontes, together with the legend to which it apparently alludes, must certainly have been known to the earlier rhapsodes, and possibly even in Mycenaean times. Any explanation of Argeiphontes must permit the epithet accurately to designate the god as he was envisaged in early times, because it is so closely associated with Hermes that it can stand by itself to replace the god's name. Finally, the god's pastoral character weightily supports the traditional interpretation of Argeiphontes. If it does mean "the Slayer of Argus" it is one of those epithets whose immediate allusion is to legend, not to locality or to cult. If, for the sake of completeness, we turn to Hesiod and the Hymn-writers it will be found that Argeiphontes remains a popular epithet and usually with Diaktoros,12 or some modify- ing adjective,'3 but as a rule, if Diaktoros is absent, it is preceded by Kparbs, EidKowroS, or Wpvwrpparts,'4 such combinations being found in Homer also. However, in Hesiod and the Hymn-writers we find three new combinations: KXVTbS 'Apyacb'vr?7s occurs once, so also Kib8lOS 'ApcuP6e'urqs1s and KVXX~LOS is once in juxtaposition with the epithet.'6 Altogether Argeiphontes occurs forty-six times in early epic. Even more significant than its frequency is the fact that it is, in a sense, an alternative name for the god in so far as, standing alone, it designates him and only him. Indeed, with few exceptions,'7 it never 4 "Argeiphontes": Iliad, XXIV, 153, 182; Odyssey, X, 302; "Diaktoros" occurs, unmodified, but with other epithets, in Odyssey, VIII, 335. 5 Iliad, II, 103; XVI, 181; XXI, 497; XXIV, 24, 109, 153, 182., 339, 345, 378, 389, 410, 434, 434, 445; Odyssey, I, 38, 84; V, 43, 49, 75, 94, 145, 148; VII, 137; VIII, 338; X, 302, 331; XXIV, 99. 6 Schol. on Iliad, XXIV, 24: 'ApyLct rly,...

Full understanding of this important epithet will only follow on an analysis of the Argus story itself. This is linked with the cult of Hera who was an Argive goddess, and is therefore probably Argive in origin as Preller has suggested." Cook"9 has carefully analysed some of the separate elements of the story, which probably obtained many of its familiar outlines at the end of the Bronze Age when the Aeolic-speaking Achaeans were in the Argolid. It appears to me that several religious and mythological strands are twisted in the tale. Its chief interest for us lies in Hermes' part in it. We must try to discover why he had any part in it at all. The usual version places him in rather a good light: at the bidding of Zeus he slays the oppressive guardian of the unfortunate Io and releases her. But such explana- tions of Hermes' role are not early and, although Homer presumably and Hesiod certainly knew of his connection with the story, there is no evidence to prove that they too judged his behaviour to be benevolent. Of course he was drawn into this story about a cow because he had pastoral concerns himself, but I think that, in early times at least, Hermes' inter- vention may well have been terrifying rather than benevolent. The Ionian who painted his idea of the story's climax (pl. 11, 12) shows us a Hermes who is almost as sinister as Argus himself, while Xanthus' account seems to preserve a tradition that Hermes' conduct was far from being thought commendable, and that he even stood his trial for murder. Literature and art usually present a benevolent Hermes, but a darker side did exist.20 Since he really plays a minor role in the story it is curious that Argeiphontes -if it does mean "Slayer of Argus" and no other interpretation of the epithet is as satisfactory as this traditional one-should be one of his most important appellations in early literature. An explanation of its prevalence, therefore, must be sought, and it is perhaps to be found not so much in the legend to which the epithet alludes as in a primitive characteristic of the pastoral god which caused him to be associated with the Argus tale in the first place. Consider the old Minoan god. Shepherds invoked him to protect their flocks but they undoubtedly had a superstitious fear of him. Besides, we know from Homer that attacks from wild beasts frequently diminished their herds, and they probably attributed such losses to the dis- pleasure of the Master or Mistress of Beasts. Now let us observe the Greek descendants of these Minoan deities. Artemis' uncertain temper is well-known, but we learn from the fourth Homeric Hymn that Hermes, although he was generally known for his affability, also pos- sessed an equivocal disposition:21 Fah m5' e -Y Or lrTOOL KaI av(Z TOLr L 6c/Lon XE. 7wacpa / E' 01W OLv?LP70 TO (' aKpLTov zl 7?7pE0oEEL VVKTa5C 8' 6ppa'chqzv' jXa-a O-v2T pco 7wcp P Furthermore, he was crafty and often played tricks on one22- .............6 5' ipa opELatvwv 566Xov .i... .

This we learn from Apollo:24 ro XXos 8' crypabXovs 'Kax /l.qES oTXOPTocrpas ovp0Eo9 'o -lans, owro' &amp;v KpELco EGpaTL&amp;'Zv adTaL /OVKOXOLCL Kal ElporoKOL~ oiOvELP Here Hermes seems to display the very characteristics of the wild beasts which he controls25 -the words KpELZv' dparL'cev are used by Homer of lions.26 In the passage just quoted Hermes is more than a cattle rustler; he is a killer. Now the most famous legends to which Hermes' name attaches amount simply to thefts not very unlike those mentioned by Apollo. The cattle of Phoebus he stole; Io, the heifer, he released (we are told) after he had slain her guardian herdsman. Finally, there is the phrase in the hymn EXar p fo&amp;wv. Hermes may be supposed to use it of himself with specific reference to Apollo's stolen cattle,27 but it first occurs in the hymn28 accompanied by a string of epithets, all of which are descriptive in general of well-known aspects and habits of Hermes, and some of which are far from complimentary! The most important asset of any shepherd was his dog. Glaukos is urged to value and care for his dogs in the so-called epigram of Homer.29 He is reminded that the dog Kal Wrprov. aKOiEL ab8p6 s ErEPXOoEaO KcL is EipEa Opops iv96ros. Compare this with Hesiod's KaC Kliva Kap- XaPbo&amp;ra KO/EY, U Et5EO altov, a' ror- a' ? 7EPOKOi7ros aVzp ar xpglaOl' XA-rat.30 And, hearing the step or scuffle of intruders, shepherd dogs sped savagely to attack, as Odysseus learned to his discomfiture when he ventured near the swineherd's hut. Relieved and thankful he was when Eumaeus appeared to call them off."8 It is clear that any ancient shepherd would regret the loss of his dog at least as bitterly as a part of his flock. From the malefactor's point of view, the savage dog was the most serious obstacle to his nefarious purpose. If beast or mortal thief were to steal a sheep successfully he would have in some way to put the shepherd dog out of action-and this was precisely what Hermes was able to do. Hipponax addressed him as KavcavlXrs and KvvdyXrs.82 Both epithets mean "Dog-throttler."'' Add to this the fact that Hermes caused a fit of strangles in the dogs which guarded Apollo's cattle in Thessaly; having done so, he drove off the cows with no trouble. This incident, according to Antoninus Liberalis,84 was referred to by Hesiod in the Great Eoiae. We find an echo of it in the Homeric hymn. After sacrificing two of the cows, Hermes crept back to Maia's cave on Mt. Kyllene observed by no god or man, and, says the author: os6' KV'VES XEXAKOV7ro.8 According to one tradition, he bewitched Argus too before he slew him. Consider Argus. Tzetzes records a tradition that he was a dog, and draws attention to 23 Iliad, XX, 35; XIV, 165. 24 Hymn to Hermes, 286 ff. 25 The evidence for these powers is set forth in my article referred to in footnote 1. 26 Iliad, XI, 551; XVII, 660. 27 Hymn to Hermes, 265. 28 Ibid., 14. 29 See H.

In epic the word apyos is often used adjectivally to describe the fleetness of dogs. KVPe S apyot occurs thrice in Homer, KV'ES r'6as ap-yol also thrice, and appytlrokas Kbas once."3 Argus was actually the proper name of Odysseus' pet hound,38 and may also have been the name of one of Actaeon's.39 Certain numismatic evidence is also illuminating. The 6th century coins of Peloponnesian Argos show an animal which is almost certainly a wolf (pl. ii, 1, 2),40 but the reverse types of bronze coins of Argos Amphilochicum struck in the 4th century B.C. -a long way back from Tzetzes - display a dog. No dispute about this is possible for the creature wears a collar (pl. II, 6, 7, 8, 9).41 The dog is at bay on many specimens, but he sometimes reclines and looks backward. Certain silver staters of Corin- thian colonial type display Pegasus on the obverse (as always), the legend AP or A, and a collared dog, larger than a normal symbol, underneath the winged horse (pl. II, 3, 4, 5).42 It is quite clear both from these staters and from the bronze coins already described that the dog is the "canting badge" of the city of Argos Amphilochicum. This fact increases the interest and importance of the god on the obverse of the bronze coins. It is unmistakably Hermes on one of them for a petasos hangs at the back of the young god's head (pl. II, 6, 7). That Hermes is intended on another coin is clear from the little petasos in the exergue of the reverse (pl. II, 8).4 We can therefore confidently identify as Hermes the youthful male head on the other specimens. These coins go far to support Tzetzes' statement. The foregoing evidence may serve to explain why Hermes was brought into the Argus legend and why the epithet Argeiphontes is used so commonly of him by Homer. Hesiod's Argus is already a "monstrum" for he has four eyes.4 Later authors and painters make him even more portentous and misshapen, but there is always a bestial trace in him on early vase-paintings. Moreover, in view of Argus' sharp sight, we would do well to remember that Eumaeus' dogs saw Odysseus before the swineherd did: the incident is introduced with these words:4 ~ ad rw7s ' 'Ov'ir~a 'o3, KVPES b XaK06copoL. Eumaeus drove them off his visitor with a "shower of stones"-rvKV7 ,0T .XLteO&amp;EoW. Is it not interesting that four separate4" sources allege that Hermes killed Argus by throwing a stone at him? The Argus of every historical period retains the Hesiodic characteristics of strength, sharp-sightedness, and sleeplessness. Homer's Hermes has an answer for all these things. His wand induces sleep;47 he is described as T^Kos and Kpar-r.48 Furthermore the word EVCKOro9 often precedes Argeiphontes when Diaktoros is absent. This adjective is used by Homer of no other divinity save Artemis herself.49 Sometime during the Bronze Age Hermes acquired another epithet the meaning of which 36 Exeg. in Hornm. II. (ed. G.

Diaktoros occurs eight times in the Iliad always preceding Argei- phontes, ten times in the Odyssey,50 and always acts as an epithet for Hermes. The dispute arises out of the use of the word by much later poets. Hermes is called Zr'6S baKropoS, so also is Iris, and the eagle of Zeus.5" It has been suggested that Diaktoros derives from L&amp;c'KW, means "Servant," and is therefore a variant of &amp;L KOVOS,52 the term by which Prometheus refers to Hermes in Aeschylus' tragedy,53 but we must bear in mind that Prometheus, bitter and irascible, is deliberately insulting in this passage where 5L'Kovos is a sneering play on words. Jessen's comment on this subject is a good one: "wenn das Beiwort schon bei Homer als alttiberkommenes verwendet ist, so muss es auf eine selbstandige gtittliche Eigenschaft zurtickgehen und kann nicht durch ein Abhangigkeitsverhaltnis zu einem andern Gott, also nicht als Diener oder Bote des Zeus, erklart werden."54 Any interpretation which needs the introduction of another god to clarify the meaning will not serve because, in the Iliad, Diaktoros never occurs even with the name Hermes, much less with that of any other god. Diaktoros can stand by itself-with other independent epithets-to mean Hermes.55 If it is to be translated as "the Servant" we must ask "the servant of whom"?-and Homer does not oblige us with an answer. Equally unsatisfactory is the translation of the word as "Messenger." Hermes is never the messenger of Zeus in the Iliad. This role is performed by Iris who is summoned on sev- eral occasions by Zeus to do his will.56 She is nowhere in the Iliad called Diaktoros. Hermes, on the other hand, nowhere in the Iliad acts as the messenger of Zeus but he is styled Diaktoros eight times. Solmsen57 believes that LtdKropoS is composed of two words, Ltd and KrEp; KrEp as the root meaning "to give," and L4dKTopoS therefore having the force of "Dispenser" or "Giver," since tda denotes transference. Boisacq58 follows Solmsen in this derivation, translating "dispensateur" and believing that the gifts in question have some connection with presents or last observances directed to the dead. Cook59 approaches this view for he considers Hermes &amp;AK7ropoS to be a chthonian god resembling Zeus IIXouro06rTs or IX6vrewov. These suggestions are tempting, for chthonian divinities usually are associated with such wealth as agricultural increase can bestow, but, first of all, Hermes was never a powerful chthonian god at any time, his main role in Hades being that of Psychopompos, itself just an extension of his function of guide to the living traveller. And with the fertility of the earth he had almost nothing to do at all. Pastoral fertility came within his sphere but instances of his interest in vegetative increase are rare enough to be remarkable. By far the best suggestion, found as early as Lucian, derives the word from d&amp;&amp;yw and interprets it as "Conductor" or "Guide."60 Ameis, considering that LKaKTopoS corresponds to &amp;AKTrwp as Xpvwcopos to Xpvowrop and 4bXaKos to bXau, translates it as "der geleitende."61 This interpretation is supported by line 392 of the Homeric Hymn to Hermes: 'Epyv e &amp;t6K7opo' ?,YEpOZEIVEw where the epithet occurs in a reference to his function of guide. A similar reference is to be found in lines 147-8 of the Hymn to Aphrodite: Aeavarov  5o Iliad, II, 103; XXI, 497; XXIV, 339, 378, 389, 410, 432, 445; Odyssey, I, 84; V, 43, 75, 94, 145; VIII, 335, 338; XII 390; XV, 319; XXIV, 99. 51 Anth.

Thus, if we interpret Diaktoros to mean "Guide" its significance is the same as ro/rbs62 or ryE1b6vtos; it can stand alone and be comprehensi- ble because it refers to or describes that independent characteristic of the god which is most prominent in the Iliad. It does not need any awkward allusion to another deity to be fully understood. If any relationship is implied at all it is one between the god and his mortal worshippers which is altogether more satisfactory, being borne out by Zeus' remark that Hermes particularly liked to act as comrade for men.63 Hermes' most important occupation in early literature is guidance of the traveller, which may lend indirect support to this interpretation. There is no need to dwell upon the Homeric references to this. Aphrodite's false tale to Anchises should not be overlooked.64 In the Works and Days, Hermes guides Pandora to the unfortunate Epimetheus,65 and drives Persephone back to Demeter,66 as he drove Priam back to Troy. For in this early period Hermes' aid along the roads extended to charioteers as well as to those who travelled on foot. Another important passage in the long hymn to Hermes relevant to this is found in the mocking words of Apollo who warns Hermes that he will certainly find his cattle in the end and -ab 8' aiO' b',y 0 j5.'o.ELS.67 Like his usual name, the epithet is descriptive of the god but whereas Hermes describes his aniconic form, Diaktoros describes his chief Homeric activity. The word, then, may be classed in early literature at least as a functional epithet. Its occurrence is not so frequent in Hesiod and the Hymns as in Homer-actually thrice with Argeiphontes, twice unmodi- fied, and twice with the name Hermes.68 But, like Argeiphontes, it is usually an "alternative name" for the god, and its greatest importance lies in that. The word Diaktoros, if spoken to an early Greek, would put him in mind of the Son of Maia, no one else. The tenth book of the Odyssey, perhaps even more than the passage from the Hymn to Aphrodite, makes plain the co-existence in Hermes' character of the powers of the old Minoan god with the Greek function of guide. But Circe herself deserves study and so do two passages which seem to me to indicate that Hermes' activity on Odysseus' behalf is even greater than has hitherto been supposed. Drawing near to the island of Aeaea, we enter with Odysseus into a part of his tale where Athena, his protector par excellence, plays no role; the stage is set, but the two divine pro- tagonists are Hermes and Circe. Their aims are different, but they are evenly matched with the same powers. Professor Rhys Carpenter in his recent startling book has endeavoured to show that the locale described in Book 10 recalls the forests of Europe rather than a Mediterranean landscape; and that the story, along with Hermes, Circe, and Odysseus himself, belongs to a mid-European group of Miirchen.69 But certain elements in Circe's divinity - as well as in Hermes' - evoke Minoan memories. Let us examine Circe. According to Homer, she is divine, not human, for he refers to her as a goddess in several passages. Cook has shown that her name is closely related to "kirkos" and denotes "the hawk."'7 That she had an original epiphany in the shape of a bird is also suggested by the strange descriptive words thrice used of her: she is "a dread goddess en- 6,2 rolrs is used of Hermes thrice in the Iliad, XXIV, 437, 439, 461; "roios roA.r6s occurs twice, XXIV, 153, 182.

Conjectures have varied considerably about the original character of Circe.72 The present writer does not claim to give a complete answer to this question but feels that an examina- tion of the earliest picture of her will do much to advance the solution. The poet of the Odyssey provides the first clear picture and he thought of Circe as a "Mistress of Animals" - wolves, swine, and lions - and so she appears to have absorbed, like Artemis, some of the main characteristics of a Minoan predecessor. The first of Circe's Minoan traits is the bird epiphany which has already been mentioned. Secondly, she is associated with wild animals. They are tame at her will, not dangerous as such beasts are by nature. Odysseus' scouting party drew back in needless alarm at the sight of the creatures.73 Her lions, moreover, guard her palace. It was the risk of ending his days as a guardian lion which led Eurylochus to protest against the proposal of Odysseus that they prolong their visit with the goddess."7 Bronze Age reminiscences in Homer are frequent and Eurylochus' words remind one forcibly of many seal stones and of the Lion Gate at Mycenae. The Minoan mistress of animals also was one who not only kept her beasts under control but used them as her guardians. Several gems as well as the famous Knossian signet75 display this. Like her Minoan forerunner, Circe also has handmaidens"7 to attend her, but so far as we know, she differs from her prototype in that she is a witch. At least we possess no evidence that the Minoan goddess practised sorcery. Circe's subject animals are actually enchanted human beings, but we must remember that the episode in the Odyssey is a fairy tale to which the element of witchcraft is essential as it is so very often with folklore of a similar kind elsewhere. A propos of this, Actaeon and Kallisto fared at Artemis' hands rather like Circe's victims. They, too, had the misfortune of being turned into beasts. Hermes, like Artemis and Circe, also had the ability to change the shape of living creatures. It was an art which he taught Autolykos, according to Hesiod.77 When the curtain is raised on the Aeaean interlude Circe is the potential villainess of the piece. She has, however, a redoubtable opponent who, although his part in the drama is smaller than hers, ably thwarts her purpose. Hermes does this with his offer of protection and guidance to Odysseus who wanders alone in Aeaea's uplands, his promise to save the hero from Circe's magic, his gift of the moly, and his advice on how best to handle the beautiful witch. If Circe is the Mistress, Hermes is the Master of Animals in this story. His appearance is significant. He is not disguised when he comes to Odysseus for the hero recognizes him instantly, and, like many Ionian artists who worked in other media, Homer thought of Hermes as a youth, verging towards manhood and therefore beardless. Observe the work of two Ionian gem engravers (pl. II, 10, 11).78 Who is the nameless god who helped Odysseus on two occasions prior to the first visit to 71 Odyssey, X, 136; XI, 8; XII, 150. 72 Cook, Zeus, I, p. 244, thinks she was originally a solar hawk; Bethe, a death goddess (RE, XI, 1, p. 503). A Moon Goddess has also been suggested; cf. Cook, op. cit., I, p. 242, and footnote 9. 73 Odyssey, X, 210 ff. In my view Professor Rhys Carpenter is not justified in assuming misunderstand- ing on the part of Eurylochus. 4 Ibid., X, 431 ff. 75 See, for example, Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, pl.

Hayman79 shows considerable interest in the anonymous divinity-perhaps one can outline an argument in favour of Hermes. First of all, the dramatic effect achieved by pro- longed suspense is one to which Homer, a great artist, was not averse. Secondly, Odysseus gives his Phaeacian listeners some fairly broad hints about the identity of this deity, re- ferred to as rTs OE~ and rts ... OJr.v The first time the god comes to his assistance is on the occasion of his ship's approach to the shore. They sailed in and beached the ship "in silence"- KaL rLS OE6S )yeI6'evev.80 That verb is the first hint Odysseus gives; it startles the reader and puts him in mind of Achilles' irritable words to Priam:8s obvb E s X O rELs 677N OeT s aLS r 'ye Gods IL vas 'AxaW=y, where we know, if Achilles does not, the identity of OE6v rLS. To act as guide is Hermes' main purpose in Odysseus' adven- ture as well as in Priam's; the verb ,YEbowveVELV often refers to this function; and iYEbL6VLO is an epithet of Hermes which is frequently encountered. It may be objected that, in this case, it is a ship and its passengers which are being guided. But Hermes' benign concern was by no means confined to those who travelled on land: sea-goers felt he offered his pro- tection to them as well.8" According to Hayman"3 owir indicates that the ship approached Aeaea by night. This a reasonable suggestion; if so, small wonder Odysseus needed divine guidance. For several references to Hermes' activity by night one need only read the fourth Homeric hymn; moreover, in it he is called Urs bVK7rwr5 6 Tpa.s* The second instance of the anonymous god's intervention is at least as interesting as the first. Odysseus, leaving his comrades asleep on the beach, sallies forth with spear and sword to reconnoitre. He climbs a peak from which he catches sight of the smoke rising from Circe's palace. On his way down he says :s &amp;XX' 6m 0 OrXE&amp; axeW 2a KLCSW VEs atLEXLOclas KaL r6r rs e OecOv 6XocPbpauro vuovov "ora 6s 'p&amp; aO'IOL 4L'KEpOWV Xabov 4uyav ELs 65v aTrp) J KCV. It is an extraordinary stroke of luck which comes his way, and once again Odysseus hints at the identity of his helper. The word b5yv nearly gives it away. The traveller, making a lucky find en route, considered it to be the gift of Hermes and it was even called an fpuacov.86 This is a very old belief. Priam himself comments on his "god-sent good luck" in happening "on such a wayfarer" as the disguised Hermes when he is on his way to Achilles."8 That Her- mes' providential gift on this occasion should be a monstrous wild stag should cause no surprise. His powers in the tenth book are enough to indicate that. But a specific association of Hermes with stags is to be found on an archaic Ionian gem (pl. 11, 10) where he firmly grips an antlered stag by the hind leg. Finally, the sense of the words 6Xocbparo toivov which occur in the passage about the stag is taken up by Hermes later on. His pity for the hero is immediately obvious, his first words are commiserating, and he even speaks of Odysseus as otoS.8 Two episodes in the ninth book are so similar to those just discussed as to be practically 9 Homeri Odyssea, II, pp. 143 f., 157. so Odyssey, X, 141. 81 Iliad, XXIV, 563 f. 82 See, for example, the 5th century inscription set up at the Peiraeus by Python of Abdera after his journey, Arch.

A god guided Odysseus' ships to the island of the Cyclopes-we find the very same phrase Kal rns Of&amp;s ieYubE6vE.89 Odysseus and his comrades fall asleep after they have come ashore, and the following morning he goes forth for game with bow, arrows, and spears, accompanied this time by his whole crew. They have a successful day for they kill many wild goats, and again Odysseus attributes their good fortune to the friendly god; atita "' HWKE ~6 S vEOKlKa 0 pr'y,90 but he mentions as well the kind co-operation of the nymphs who roused the mountain goats in the first place: Apoav bi vY Cat, KOipalt AtL avcLyXOto, acyas 6pEOKCOVS.91 This passage, together with the one in the tenth book, seems at first sight to refer only to a nameless hunter's god. But both Hermes and his Minoan forerunner were invoked by hunters; with Homer we are very close to the Bronze Age, and Minoan-Mycenaean reminiscences in his epics do occur. As to the goats and the nymphs mentioned in the ninth book, the association of them both with Hermes should be so well-known as to need no emphasis. We might just add that Autolykos, a mighty hunter and brigand who lived on Parnassus according to Homer, paid Hermes serious cult, offering him young goats and lambs. 92 But let us return to Odysseus in Book 10. He could be foolhardy as well as wise, prudent, and of a patient heart. Eurylochus, in tearful vexation, calls him "Opacrbs"93 and refers, rather tactlessly, to the Polyphemus episode. Circe later on goes still further, crying out "XET '""94 because Odysseus even ventures to oppose the gods. It was in such a mood of defiance - after all, Circe was a goddess - that he approached her house alone. Was it not inevitable that his helper should finally manifest himself? Hermes does so just before Odys- seus reaches Circe. To conclude: Hermes had actually warned Circe beforehand that she would fail to enchant Odysseus.95 We know that it was really be, not Odysseus who out- witted her by giving the hero the moly as well as good advice. Circe's admission to Odysseus of Hermes' warning to her is surely yet another hint that rLs 0N&amp; is none other but Hermes himself.
