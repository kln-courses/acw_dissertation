<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evolution of the Self, the Need to Belong, and Life in a Delayed-Return Environment Mark R. Leary and Catherine A. Cottrell Department of Psychology Wake Forest University Several lines of theory and research converge on the idea that people are happier and more effective when they receive frequent feedback regarding the conse- quences of their behavior than when the effects of their behavior are delayed, uncertain, or unclear. Martin (this issue) has made an important contribution in link- ing this psychological fact with a broad model of moti- vation couched within an evolutionary framework. We applaud Martin's "big picture" perspective on funda- mental questions of human motivation and find our- selves in agreement with many, but not all, of his points. Our commentary focuses on three topics rele- vant to I-D compensation theory: the role of the self in adaptation to a delayed-return system, Martin's claim that social motives do not affect behavior when imme- diate-return needs are being met, and modem life in a delayed-return environment. The Role of the Self in a Delayed-Return Lifestyle Although Martin (this issue) does not discuss the self at length, the processes he describes are closely tied to the capacity to self-reflect. The ability to function effec- tively in a delayed-return environment requires a so- phisticated self that permits the individual to imagine himself or herself in the future and to consider the possi- ble consequences of various behavioral options. An organism without the ability to reflect consciously on it- self does not fare well when long-range planning is re- quired to maximize its future well-being, although it can function quite well in an environment in which its ac- tions have immediate consequences. An organism with- out an articulated self also does not fare well when the signs of progress toward distant goals are symbolic rather than tangible. This is not to say that goal-directed actions are impossible without self-awareness. Not only do people mindlessly engage in goal-directed behavior every day, but other animals behave in ways that will have distal consequences without active planning or self-reflective thinking (such as squirrels storing nuts or pregnant rats building nests). The fact that a sophisticated sense of self is needed to act effectively when the consequences of one's be- havior lie far in the future raises the question of whether the evolution of the self was in any way asso- ciated with human beings moving from an immediate- to delayed-returned lifestyle. Perhaps the appearance of higher level self-processes permitted human beings to imagine their futures for the first time, thereby al- lowing agriculture and other changes in civilization that require a long-range perspective. Alternatively, the change from an immediate- to delayed-return envi- ronment may have created conditions that promoted 229</page><page sequence="2">COMMENTARIES the emergence of the symbolic self. Did the environ- mental changes that were responsible for agriculture and the I -&gt; D transition Martin describes provide the impetus for cognitive changes that permitted con- scious thought about the future? Of course, these ques- tions cannot be answered with any degree of confidence, but that will not deter us from speculating on the basis of circumstantial evidence. Most animals do not possess the capacity for con- scious self-reflection, and even the great apes pale in comparison to human beings in their ability to self-reflect (Gallup &amp; Suarez, 1986; Povinelli, 1993). Human self-awareness did not likely emerge full-blown but rather developed slowly over the long haul of evolu- tionary time. So when in the evolutionary past did hu- man (or prehuman) beings develop the degree of self-reflection that modem human beings possess to- day, and was this event associated with the transition from an immediate- to a delayed-return lifestyle? Sedikides and Skowronski (1997) provided an ex- tensive discussion of the evolution of the self, locating the emergence of the symbolic self (which is needed for a consciously futuristic orientation in a de- layed-return environment) approximately 1.8 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus in the late Pleistocene epoch. Certain nonhuman primates and prehuman homonids may have had the capacity to recognize themselves (as some modern apes do), but they did not have the sophisticated sort of fu- ture-looking symbolic self that permits survival in a delayed-return environment. In contrast, Jaynes (1976) placed the origin of the self at a much more recent date, offering the controversial suggestion that human self-consciousness arose only 3,000 years ago. His analysis of the writings, art, and religion from many ancient cultures suggests that full-fledged self-awareness arose sometime after 1000 BCE (see also Cooper, 1996). Our view is influenced by the work ofMithen (1996), a psychological archeologist who locates the emer- gence of self-reflexive thinking between 30,000 and 60,000 years ago. Mithen provides evidence that the Neanderthals, who lived from 115,000 to 30,000 years ago, did not possess self-consciousness, and even early human beings (Homo sapiens sapiens) initially showed little evidence of self-awareness when they appeared around 100,000 years ago. However, at the time of the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition (around 40,000 years ago), several major cultural changes appeared suddenly, leading archeologists to characterize this pe- riod as the "big bang of human culture" (Mithen, 1996, p. 151). Forthe firsttime, we see clearevidence ofrepre- sentational art, personal adornment (e.g., beads and pendants), anthropomorphism, boat making, religion, and intentional burials that included grave goods. Mithen discussed several cognitive changes that may have precipitated these remarkable innovations in hu- man life, but self-reflexive thinking seems to have been involved. These cultural advances required the ability to imagine oneself (or others) in the future or to view one- self from others' perspectives. Not coincidentally, the first human skeletons that are anatomically indistin- guishable from those of contemporary human beings also date to 30,000 to 40,000 years ago (Foley, 1988; Mithen, 1996). None of the dates postulated for the emergence of the human self- 1.8 million, 40,000, or 3,000 years ago-coincide closely with the emergence of the de- layed-return lifestyle that Martin (this issue) places at approximately 10,000 years ago. The best we can say is that, Jaynes (1976) not withstanding, human beings apparently evolved the capacity to imagine themselves in the future prior to this time, thereby permitting them to live a delayed-return lifestyle by the time of the I -&gt; D transition.1 The question arises, however, of why people had not developed a delayed-return lifestyle (including agriculture) prior to 10,000 years ago if they had possessed an adequate symbolic self for tens or hundreds of thousands of years. Evidence suggests that the transition from hunting and gathering to farming and pastoralism was not caused primarily by improved knowledge of plants and animals, increasing popula- tion density outstripping the wild food supply, or global climatic changes (see Hole, 1992; Mithen, 1996). Whatever the reason, the transition to an agrar- ian lifestyle appears to have been a slow process after people had the requisite cognitive ability needed to make long-range plans for the future. Psychological Concomitants of Living in a Delayed-Return Environment Martin (this issue) hypothesizes that a de- layed-return environment produces decidedly differ- ent psychological consequences than an immedi- ate-return one. In perhaps his most controversial statement, Martin suggests that individuals who maintain an immediate-return lifestyle "can go through life without the general social psychological motives exerting much influence on their behavior." Specifically, he suggests that many fundamental psy- chological motives-such as those involved in ego-defense, the need for social acceptance, and ter- In Jaynes's (1976) defense, something notable clearly happened to human consciousness (and cognition more generally) during the period Jaynes identified as the dawn ofhuman consciousness. Jaspers (1953) called this period, centered a few hundred years on either side of 500 BCE, the "axial age" because from that point onward, the mea- ger human achievements of earlier times radiated into the diverse forns of philosophy, science, and religion that we have today. How- ever, we believe that self-awareness had already emerged by this time, although some kind of major change in cognition or conscious- ness occurred during the axial age (see Cooper, 1996). 230</page><page sequence="3">COMMENTARIES ror management-are generally quiescent in an im- mediate-return environment and become active only when people are "deprived" of the ability to satisfy their immediate-return needs. Although Martin discusses several motives that he believes arise only when immediate-return needs are unfulfilled, we focus on his speculations about the need to belong (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). Accord- ing to I-D compensation theory, people do not fear re- jection in an immediate-return environment because their immediate-return needs are satisfied through fre- quent feedback regarding progress toward their goals. However, the evidence that Martin provides involving the observation that people in immediate-return envi- ronments do not reject one another clouds the issue be- cause it confounds two separate processes. Citing the case of the Hazda-hunter-gatherers who allow lepers into their camps-Martin implies that people in imme- diate-return systems do not reject one another. If this is in fact true, it would certainly explain why people in such a society are unconcerned about being rejected, but such examples confuse the issue of whether people in an immediate-return system do not fear rejection simply because rejection is unlikely (a somewhat unin- teresting explanation) or, as I-D compensation theory directly suggests, because their immediate-return needs are satisfied. We believe that the possibility of rejection exists in every social group (Williams, 1997). Perhaps the Hazda do not ostracize lepers, but it is difficult to believe that they would not ignore, shun, or ostracize deviant group members who jeopardized the group's well-being in other ways. Indeed, many other species exclude conspecifics. For example, based on her 23 years of fieldwork with the Gombe chimpanzees, Goodall (1986) reported that, although chimps do not demon- strate the kinds of organized group ostracism observed in human beings, they clearly reject one another (see also Lancaster, 1986; Nishida, Hosaka, Nakamura, &amp; Hamai, 1995). We do not doubt that people who live in immediate-return environments may reject one another less than people in industrialized societies; indeed, many factors known to influence attraction and accep- tance (e.g., physical and attitudinal similarity, proxim- ity) favor greater acceptance among small tribal groups than in larger communities. Even so, the potential for re- jection should be present. In any event, the fact that people are less con- cerned about rejection when rejection is unlikely does not address the I-D compensation claim that con- cerns with social acceptance arise only when a person is in a delayed-return relationship with the environ- ment. The theory suggests that human beings who live in an immediate-return system would not seek social acceptance or worry about rejection even when social exclusion is a real possibility. (After all, in dis- cussing people's fear of death, Martin suggests that people whose immediate-return needs are satisfied do not fear death, which is nonetheless inevitable.) Fur- thermore, by implication, the motive to be accepted by other people was not particularly important in the lives of prehistoric human beings or for hunter-gath- erers today. What are we to make of the claim that people were not concerned about social acceptance or naturally en- dowed to detect exclusion until the last 1 0,000 years? No evidence exists to settle the issue, of course, but we find it difficult to believe that human beings living in social groups prior to 1 0,000 years ago never behaved in ways that incurred the displeasure of their fellows or jeopardized their standing within the group. As noted, even chimpanzees exclude deviants and outsiders, and much of the appeasement behavior of chimps and other nonhuman primates can be viewed as ways of assuring the individual's acceptance by other group members. Even if one is receiving frequent feedback about one's progress toward goals, one's social acceptance by the group would be of great importance, particularly in the ancestral environment. Psychological Fallout of Life in a Delayed-Return System If Martin (this issue) is correct (and we think he is) that human evolution occurred primarily in an immedi- ate-return environment, most people today are living in circumstances for which they are constitutionally ill-suited. Human intelligence, paired with the capacity for self-reflection, has allowed us to make the best out of a bad situation, but our inherent lack of fit to modern life may explain many psychological features of con- temporary Western society. To show the richness of thinking in these terms, we mention just two that deal with the emotional difficulties that people have dealing with future events. First, creatures who, during evolution, lived day to day with little thought of the future would have trouble coping with the conscious realization that their futures are uncertain and that they needed to expend effort to- day to ensure their survival in the future. The fact that human beings evolved under circumstances in which they rarely planned for or worried about the future may help to explain the very high incidence of anxiety in daily modern life. Anxiety is always about the future. We find it informative that anxiety is an exceptionally common human experience, whereas indifferent com- placency about the future is quite rare. Second, people would seek ways to cope emotion- ally with this uncertainty and would look for ways to assuage their uncertain fears of the future. Many of the strategies that people use to "escape the self' (Baumeister, 1991) may be viewed as ways to return psychologically to immediate-return environments in which one focuses only on events occurring in the 231</page><page sequence="4">COMMENTARIES present moment. Alcoholism, masochism, and medita- tion, for example, reduce one's focus on future events. The worldwide adherence to religious practices of var- ious kinds may also meet the need to deal with de- layed-return uncertainty. All major religions contain features designed to lower people's anxieties about the future-both in this life and hereafter. Various reli- gions do so in different ways, but they all seem de- signed precisely for individuals who are worried about their futures. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the world's major religions-Hinduism, Judaism, Bud- dhism, Christianity, and Islam-emerged within cen- turies of one another not too very long after the hypothesized I -&gt; D transition. In applying the distinction between immedi- ate-return and delayed-return systems to psychological motives, I-D compensation theory opens a wide array of phenomena to new avenues of speculation, theory, and research. Although we disagree with the view that motives for social acceptance operate only in de- layed-return environments, we concur that human be- ings live today in situations that differ structurally from those in which they evolved and that this fact may inform us about human cognition, emotion, motiva- tion, and behavior.
