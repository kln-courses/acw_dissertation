<plain_text><page sequence="1">Teaching Community Via Biology in Late-Nineteenth-Century Germany By Lynn K. Nyhart* ABSTRACT In the 1880s, the German schoolteacher Friedrich Junge proposed reforming the school biology curriculum away from taxonomy and replacing it with a hands-on curriculum organized around the concept of the Lebensgemeinschaft, or "biotic community." Junge's ideas spread rapidly across Germany, eventually becoming the basis for an entirely re- formed curriculum. This paper argues that Junge's reform scheme appealed primarily for two reasons: first, its presentation of nature as a harmonious community resonated with the goals of schoolteachers who wanted to use nature as a model for inculcating proper behavior among their pupils, especially in light of the threat of socialism; and second, it afforded teachers-especially low-status elementary school teachers-a chance to claim much-wanted autonomy for their classroom practices. The paper thus shows how educa- tional reform may be seen as a key historical zone of interaction at the meeting points of science, civil society, and the state. INTRODUCTION T HE HISTORY OF EDUCATION has long offered historians a fruitful means of examining the intersecting forces of society and state in steering and accom- modating social change. As one of the basic institutions of modem society, schools must balance the tensions between maintaining social order and promoting change, and between reproducing elites and giving the rest of the population what they are believed to need to function in society. Where the balance points lie at any given time and place depends on the constellation of power among those invested in schooling, which may include state, local, and religious authorities, school directors, teachers, and parents. The conviction among these various participants that schools are essential to shaping society has often made contests over school reform a reveal- ing mirror of both the beliefs held by these different groups and the relations among them. In Germany in the 1880s and 1890s, education was a particularly intense field of struggle, as Germans sought to deal with their rapidly changing world. The country was undergoing massive physical, technological, economic, and social changes as it industrialized late and fast. Areas of heavy industry, once mere pockets of produc- tion, had begun to eat up whole portions of the countryside, especially along the Rhine, Ruhr, and Saar Rivers.

NYHART goods, and people to the ever expanding cities, where the population of workers and would-be workers was growing ever faster. Political changes accompanied these transformations: whereas liberals dominated much of political life in the 1860s and the early 1870s, by the late 1870s their power was being increasingly challenged on both the left and the right. The National Liberal Party itself began adopting more conservative positions beginning in 1879. In the 1880s and 1890s the political land- scape would become even more fractured and polarized between left and right.' Within this context, both liberals and conservatives believed schooling to be a key to Germany's future. Perhaps the most urgent issue was how schools would deal with the problem euphemistically called "the social question": how to contain the bitter class differences that had emerged in the recent dramatic upswing of industri- alization and urbanization and their attendant social, economic, and political dislo- cations. What information, behavior, and values should be taught in the schools to help hold German society together? In what direction should schools shape the fu- ture of Germany as a society and as a nation? In 1885 Friedrich Junge, the head of a girls' school in the Schleswig-Holstein port city of Kiel, entered the reform arena with a book titled Die Naturgeschichte in der Volksschule: Der Dorfteich als Lebensgemeinschaft (Natural history in the elemen- tary school: the village pond as a biotic community). The Dorfteich, as it became known, catalyzed a chain of pedagogical reforms that by the early twentieth century would transform the teaching of biology in German schools. This paper analyzes how and why, within the context of struggle over German schooling, Junge's reform ideas so rapidly came to stand at the center of debate among schoolteachers over the reform of biology education. This story shows how schoolteachers could use science-in this case, the theoreti- cal principles associated with Junge's biotic community concept and the pedagogical principles associated with hands-on investigation of phenomena-to educate their pupils toward a vision of nature and society that, while accommodating change, maintained respect for existing social, political, and economic structures. At the same time, this story illuminates the ambiguous position in late-nineteenth-century Germany of reform-minded schoolteachers, who moved back and forth between their roles as low-level servants of the state and independent advocates of their own ideas for reform. This paper thus examines two kinds of articulation between science and civil society: the uses of a particular model of nature and a particular style of science learning to inculcate civic virtues, and the means by which teachers of natu- ral history used the tools of civil society-free associations and the independent periodical press-to assert their own (limited) autonomy in matters of curricular reform. In tracing both these articulations it is important to bear in mind the conceptualiza- tion of civil society that predominated in nineteenth-century Germany. Germans did not see civil society (or its German rough equivalent, biirgerliche Gesellschaft) and the state as autonomous realms defined in opposition to one another, but as two 1 My characterization of this period has been drawn especially from Wolfgang J.

Press, 1997). 142</page><page sequence="3">TEACHING COMMUNITY VIA BIOLOGY tightly interconnected aspects of the social organization of life beyond the family.2 Although this idea is often treated as peculiarly German, it is not quite as far from other concepts of civil society as it may initially seem. Indeed, the idea of a citizenry that is not itself part of the formal state bureaucratic apparatus but that makes the state possible through participation in public economic, political, and social life has been central to many conceptions of the state-civil society relationship. In this con- ceptualization, the behavior of the good citizen, and a shared concept of the society to which he or she contributes, is critical to the success of the larger life of the polity.3 And in late-nineteenth-century Germany, as elsewhere, teaching the behav- ioral norms appropriate to good citizenship was seen as a vital function of the pub- lic schools. Attention to these two aspects of civil society-its normative dimensions and its close relationship to the state in German conceptions-is especially appropriate for the case under discussion in this paper, for biology teaching reformers in the 1880s and 1890s devoted little effort to distinguishing between state and civil society. On the contrary, at a time when socialists and communists appeared permanently com- mitted to persuading the rapidly growing industrial lower classes that the only solu- tion to their plight lay in the overthrow of the existing system, a prominent biirger- lich response was to reassert the commonalities of civil society and the state. Biology teachers shared in this response by repeatedly making use of analogies that emphasized the similarities among different social and political realms. In fact, as I shall argue, themes of connection, mediation, and reconciliation are central to under- standing the success of Junge's program, recurring as they do in the focus on the Lebensgemeinschaft as an integrated network of interdependent individuals and in the use of this curriculum to promulgate behavioral norms (including especially respect for others) that applied equally to all and-crucially-could be understood 2 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel influentially articulated one version of this view in his Philoso- phy of Right in 1821, in which he presented civil society as the somewhat chaotic, unselfconscious arena for expression of individual, private, self-interest that needed to be tempered, regularized, made self-conscious, and thereby perfected in the form of the state. (For a recent gloss on Hegel's concept of civil society, see John Ehrenberg, Civil Society: The Critical History of an Idea [New York: New York Univ. Press, 1999], pp. 121-32.) In 1851 and again in 1864, Munich's influential conservative publisher-editor-joumalist and sometime student of German folk culture and history Wilhelm Riehl offered a different assessment of biirgerliche Gesellschaft, arguing that civil society and the state were not two different things, but rather two different viewpoints for conceptualizing the structure of society. (Wilhelm H. Riehl, Die biirgerliche Gesellschaft, ed. Peter Steinbach [1887; reprinted, Frankfurt am Main and Berlin and Vienna: Ullstein, 1976]; idem, "Uber den Begriff der biirgerlichen Gesellschaft" [1864], reprinted in ibid.) Nor were such views of the interconnectedness of civil soci- ety and state confined to conservatives such as Riehl. As Daniel A. McMillan has recently put it, "Even the most determined liberals abhorred conflict between state and civil society, and sought not so much the autonomy of civil society from the state, but rather harmonious collaboration between the two."

Frank Trentmann (New York: Berg- hahn Books, 2000), pp. 176-95, on p. 177. 3 Such behavioral norms are implicit in political theories as different as Jean-Jacques Rousseau's social contract and Hegel's theory of civil society (biirgerliche Gesellschaft) and the state, in which social custom (Sittlichkeit) plays a prominent role.

Dunning, A History of Political Theories from Rousseau to Spencer (New York: Macmillan, 1920).

NYHART as deriving from nature. Overall, the concepts of Gemeinschaft (community) and Lebensgemeinschaft (biotic community) were used in a way that blurred the distinc- tions between different social, institutional, and political categories to present an organicist vision of society variously articulated in connection with state, economy, or civil society. Junge's program included more than a theorized model of nature and society. Central to it was also a particular approach to learning, one which we might today call "hands-on" or investigative learning about nature. Here, too, a particular view emerges of the appropriate characteristics of the ideal citizen, this time understood not in relation to the content of the curriculum, but in relation to its pedagogy: the citizen modeled here is one who sees and thinks for himself or herself but under- stands that the rule of law must be obeyed. The program associated with the Lebens- gemeinschaft thus balanced innovative subject matter and a progressive pedagogical approach with a more conservative ideological message aimed at maintaining social harmony through the inevitable processes of change. Although the biological con- tent of Junge's program remained controversial, its pedagogy, the opportunities it offered schoolteachers to shape their own curriculum, and the ideological messages it supported, I argue, made it a powerful force for change in biology education. The paper is divided into five sections. After laying out some basics concerning the larger educational reform context in the first section, I discuss in the second Junge's background and the basic elements of his program. The third section gives a brief overview of the spread of Junge's ideas, focusing on the various venues in which the Dorfteich gained attention. In the fourth section, I consider the reception of Junge's pedagogical innovations and biological concepts among both elementary and high school teachers, showing which aspects were embraced, which were more likely to undergo modification, and which tended to be rejected altogether. The fifth and final section examines more closely the ideological messages of the Dorfteich within the broader context of character education, arguing ultimately that Junge's program succeeded, despite its controversial scientific content, because its ideologi- cal uses were so powerful. I. THE EDUCATIONAL SETTING AND SCHOOL REFORM Natural history was generally taught to children between the ages of nine and thir- teen. In the structure of German schools, this meant that Junge's program could be of interest to teachers in elementary, middle, and higher schools, since each school type included children of these ages. To understand the program's aims as well as its reception, then, it is useful to know something about these different school types and the larger battles over school reform, which revolved around the schools' pro- foundly class-based nature and their perceived potential for being a fundamental instrument for shaping society. Although we usually think of public education as a function of "the state," in fact, when we look at the structure of German school administration in the late nineteenth century, the nation-state rapidly dissolves into lower-level entities. In the first place, no uniform national educational standards existed: each of Germany's states made its own rules. Nor were these regulations necessarily the ones that counted most, for education, especially at the lower levels, had long been largely a matter of local, regional, and provincial interest. Within each state, the structure of education varied 144</page><page sequence="5">TEACHING COMMUNITY VIA BIOLOGY Table 1: German school types, grades, and ages, ca. 1890. Shaded area represents most frequent grades for natural history instruction. The higher schools traditionally counted their grades from the oldest age downward, using roman numerals; each of the highest three grades was divided into two years, designated Oberstufe (0) and Unterstufe (U). Middle-level schools numbered their grades from oldest (1) to youngest (6), while elementary schools typically numbered theirs in the opposite direction.

Cities traditionally supported their own schools, with little or no financial or administrative involvement from the state. Both urban and rural elementary schools were also deeply shaped by local confessional practices and politics, since nearly all were run as either Catholic or Protestant schools. (Efforts to develop a secular school type in the 1870s, though a significant feature in the reform landscape of the period, did not succeed in upending the confessional schools.)4 Even the basic structures of schooling varied wildly: although most elementary schools (Volksschu- len) had only two or three grades, they might contain as many as seven or eight. In Prussia, reforms in 1882 reorganized that state's educational structure but did not reduce its complexity, instead producing a finely graded hierarchy beginning with the elementary schools and extending through at least six different school types with varying educational requirements and grade levels to the pinnacle, the Gymnasium. Many of these school types overlapped in their grade levels and curricular expecta- tions, but each had a separate niche in the attempt to create a curricular order. (See Table 1.) Other states had equally arcane and complicated systems. Generally, the most important division was that between "higher" schools, which prepared students for university and polytechnical education; and "lower" schools, which encom- passed elementary and middle-level schools-all those schools that did not prepare 4Frank-Michael Kuhlemann, "4.I.i.

Throughout Germany in the imperial period, school forms were in flux and constituted a field of continued struggle over who would have access to what sorts of schooling, advanced education, jobs, and legal privi- leges.5 Reform efforts aimed variously at the structure of schools, the educational requirements of the teachers, and curricular content. Structure was a major battleground: it had long been the case that possibilities for upward mobility were tied to, and limited by, access to the right type of school. Unlike most small towns and villages, larger cities had more than one school, and the decision about what sort of school to send one's child to was, more often than not, a matter of class. For example, in the city of Kiel, where Junge taught, there were four kinds of schools. The free elementary schools, or Volksschulen, intended for the poorest segment of Kiel's society, taught only the most basic subjects. The regular Biirgerschulen (one for boys and one for girls, both founded in 1861) charged a modest tuition and had a broader curriculum. The "higher" girls' and boys' Biirgerschulen, also founded in 1861, were intended to serve Kiel's better citizens (though not university-bound boys); still their fees were kept unusually low to open up access to the lower orders (in line with Kiel's liberal educational policy). They sought primarily to compete with the private schools for the sons and daughters of the Besitzburgertum, or propertied middle class, and offered instruction in a wide assortment of "moder" subjects, including two moder languages. At the top of the system stood the Gelehrtenschule, or humanistic Gymnasium, which prepared boys for the university and the futures opened up by it.6 This system was replicated else- where, with school fees largely determining the options open to different families; because of the different curricular structures in the various schools, once a child was placed in one kind of school it was very hard to jump to another. The efforts by reformers (often themselves from modest backgrounds) to open up structural access to the higher schools for pupils of the lower and middling classes created a major arena of struggle, in which each school type pushing to open access upward generally had to battle a certain resistance from teachers and administrators of the next higher level of school. The latter, though willing in theory to admit a trickle of the best and brightest from the lower orders, sought to maintain their own level of social exclusivity (while themselves often pushing to open up access to yet a higher school level).7 5 For an overview of German school types, see Detlef K.

Teachers, too, were segregated by educational background and thus to a great extent by class as well. To teach in the higher schools normally required a university degree as well as a state license obtained through an examination. Ele- mentary school teachers participated in an entirely separate educational system, or- ganized around teaching seminaries that they generally attended in their late teenage years. Most states typically had a three-year course, though some required only two years of training and a few as many as five (including a preparatory year or two).8 Prospective elementary teachers could, with appropriate preparatory courses, attend the seminaries after having attended Volksschulen, without having attended a higher school; indeed, until the turn of the century the seminaries had lower status than the Gymnasien, since the seminary certificates did not confer admission to the universi- ties. Graduates of the seminary courses could teach at elementary schools and per- haps eventually rise to the level of running their own teaching seminaries. They could also teach in the middle-level schools, though only in the case of girls' middle schools were they eligible to rise to the level of director. But seminary graduates could not teach in the higher schools, which required a university degree. Moreover, they drew such low salaries that most had to take on some kind of second job to survive, especially if they had families to support. Nor were they eligible for the voluntary one-year military service that would allow them the prestige-inceasing entry into the reserve officer corps and access to positions in the imperial bureau- cracy. In sum, their educations, salaries, and lack of legal privileges put them at or below the bottom end of the Burgertum. It is not surprising that the lower schools served as a perennial wellspring of school reformers.9 Structural considerations were only part of the picture, though. Of what subjects should the curriculum consist, and to what ends? Traditionally, the lower schools emphasized reading, writing, arithmetic, and religion, while the higher schools of- fered a classical education that promoted an idealistic cultivation of the self associ- ated with the term Bildung. But already in the 1860s and 1870s both levels of school- ing faced new pressures to include more "moder" subjects. In Prussia, new school regulations in 1872 dramatically increased the hours elementary teachers were ex- pected to devote to the so-called Realfdcher, the subjects that concerned factual knowledge of the world (the natural sciences, geography, and history), seen by re- formers as essential for the moder citizen. At higher educational levels, too, the development of Realschulen and Realgymnasien as alternatives to the classics- oriented humanistic Gymnasium marked a pronounced challenge to classical educa- tion, one that led to major and protracted battles in the field of secondary education over reducing the amount of Latin and Greek instruction and replacing those hours with other subjects, especially modern languages, German history, and natural sci- ences.'0 The struggles over the content of education were not, of course, merely about how many hours of what subjects should be covered in which grades. At a deeper level, 8 J. Tews, "Lehrer an Volksschulen" in Enzyklopddisches Handbuch der Pddagogik, ed. Wilhelm Rein, 7 vols. (Langensalza: H.

NYHART they were about what sort of future citizens the schools should be developing, how best to form such citizens, and who would get to choose the paths of citizen forma- tion. From the 1870s on, reformers vied with one another to demonstrate the poten- tial of different subject matter, organized in different ways, to develop not only the sorts of knowledge but also the moral and ethical characteristics required of the good German citizen. Thus in 1884 a teacher at the annual provincial teachers' meeting in Silesia argued that a main task of the elementary school was to instill in children the sense of joy in work and desire for work (Lust an derArbeit), while in 1885, the same year Junge's Dorfteich appeared, a teacher at the annual meeting of the national teachers' association could ask in the title of a speech, "What must the school do to fulfill the moral task of natural history instruction?"" Physics teachers argued that the proper teaching of such scientific concepts as "work" in physics could reinforce respect for work in the sense of labor as well; a scientific understanding of "law" could teach students the limits of opinion. Proponents of particular subjects ranging from art to economics, from mathematics to geography and, of course, natural his- tory, all made pitches for the moral, ethical, and/or practical value of their special fields.12 The intensity of these claims would reach a peak soon after 1889, when the new emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who had ascended the throne the previous year, weighed in with his own agenda: schools should educate students toward "fear of God and love of the fatherland," and away from communistic and socialistic ideas.'3 There followed in 1890 a major national school conference and in 1892 new regula- tions, in which modem history, geography, and physical education-all aimed at building the spirit and body of the nation-took on new prominence, while attention to the exigencies of modem practical life came in the form of new emphasis on drawing, modem languages, and natural sciences.'4 Although the new formal guide- lines for curricular reform were put into place in the early 1890s, it is important to recognize that they represented a culmination, not a starting point, of reformers' activities. Junge's reform proposal was the most prominent of these in the field of natural history.

Like other reform ideas, Junge's proposals spoke to the need to modernize the curriculum as well as to the moral and ethical lessons that could be drawn from nature. To understand how he sought to do this, it is now necessary to turn to Junge himself and the exposition of his program. II. FRIEDRICH JUNGE AND THE DORFTEICH Friedrich Junge (1832-1905) was in many ways a typical German self-taught teacher-naturalist.'5 Raised in extremely modest circumstances in the Holstein town of Oldesloe by his mother (widow of the shoemaker father he never met), he was taken on at age sixteen by his elementary schoolteacher to prepare for the seminary and subsequently attended the three-year teaching seminary in the nearby town of Segeberg. Between 1854 and 1873 he worked at four different lower schools around Holstein; in 1873 he moved to the first girls' Burgerschule in Kiel, where he taught until his retirement in 1899. When he published the Dorfteich in 1885, Junge had been rector of the girls' school for seven years. Like most teachers of the lower school grades, Junge had learned his science, including natural history, largely on his own, filtered through the existing pedagogi- cal and popular science literature. As a seminarian, he, along with his classmates, had been inspired by Friedrich Adolf Diesterweg, the prominent liberal Volksschule reformer of the 1830s-1850s, to read the newly founded popular magazine Die Na- tur. This magazine had introduced him to popular books in natural history, including those by the magazine's coeditor, Karl August Muller, whose Humboldt-inspired Buch der Pflanzenwelt. Versuch einer kosmischen Botanik (Book of the plant world. Attempt at a cosmic botany) Junge found particularly appealing.'6 Curiosity and an experimental nature had led him in the late 1850s to create a photographic camera "out of a cigar-box and a magnifying glass"; later borrowing another camera, he had earned money on the side taking photographic portraits. Out of these funds he had purchased a microscope to study plant development. He also had used it to moonlight as a "trichina-examiner" (presumably inspecting pork), which in turn had earned him enough money to buy his own camera. He thus bootstrapped himself into considerable scientific and technical knowledge, experience that undoubtedly strengthened his conviction that every teacher could, indeed, be a scientific re- searcher, as Diesterweg had argued. Only in the late 1870s did Junge take a formal scientific course, attending the public zoology lectures for teachers held by the Kiel university professor Karl M6bius (himself once a schoolteacher) and working with Mobius's assistant Friedrich Heincke in the Kiel university zoology laboratory. It was from M6bius that Junge learned the two terms that would figure promi- nently in his work: Erhaltungsmiiaigkeit and Lebensgemeinschaft. Erhaltungsgemafi 15 Unless otherwise noted, all information on Junge's background comes from "Friedrich Junge" Deutsches Biographisches Archiv (DBA) Fiche 615, pp. 37-50, which includes an autobiographical sketch. 16 The term "cosmic botany" may in fact refer to Humboldt's Kosmos and be more properly trans- lated as "in the manner of the Kosmos." I thank Tom Broman for pointing out this possibility to me. On the influence of Humboldt's Kosmos on popular and amateur naturalists in the mid-nineteenth century, see Andreas Daum, Wissenschaftspopularisierung im 19. Jahrhundert: Biirgerliche Kultur, naturwissenschaftliche Bildung und die deutsche Offentlichkeit, 1848-1914 (Munich: Oldenbourg, 1998), pp. 138-67, 273-86; and idem, article in this volume titled "Science, Politics, and Religion: Humboldtian Thinking and the Transformations of Civil Society in Germany, 1830-1870" 149</page><page sequence="10">LYNN K. NYHART and Erhaltungsmdfiigkeit referred to the ability of organisms to maintain themselves in relation to their surroundings; these terms represented Mibius's effort to find nonteleological language to describe this phenomenon. Lebensgemeinschaft was a translation of Mobius's neologism Bioconose, a word Mobius coined in 1877 to refer to an ecological community; Mobius himself first translated the term as Lebensge- meinde but also referred to the same concept, right from the start, as a "Gemeinschaft of living beings." Both Erhaltungsmiifigkeit and Lebensgemeinschaft were central to Junge's pedagogical program. The Dorfteich set out from a simple but radical idea. Instead of organizing the teaching of natural history around taxonomic categories, Junge proposed organizing it around Lebensgemeinschaften, or biological communities, groups of organisms that lived in a particular chemico-physical setting and were dependent on that setting and on one another for their survival.17 As he elaborated in the book's programmatic essay, "Ziel und Verfahren des naturgeschichtlichen Unterrichts" (The goal and method of natural history instruction), this radical shift from taxonomic categories to those of the community and its members had numerous pedagogical benefits. Following reformist precepts that had been popular since at least the time of Johann Heinreich Pestalozzi in the previous century, Junge's approach started off from the familiar, material world surrounding the children. The example he worked out most thoroughly in this book was, of course, the village pond, but he emphasized that whatever was local to the children was the place to start. (This meant that teachers could not blindly follow Junge's model but would in most cases have to create their own curricula-something for which Junge was often criticized, but which appealed to other populists.) A second, closely related precept was that the teaching should take place at least in part in a natural setting. Field trips outside the walls of the school, to learn about nature in nature, were an essential aspect of the curriculum; students then brought back to the classroom elements of that place to study, using school aquariums, terrariums, and gardens to keep the organisms alive. But the expe- rience of nature in situ was crucial, for several reasons. For one, it kept things con- crete and familiar, on the assumption that children were most interested in that with which they had daily contact. For another, the learning was to be "hands-on," medi- ated through the various senses in accordance with pedagogically prominent ideas in psychology, such that children would learn through Anschauung, visual and tactile experience of the objects. These various pedagogical methods and principles were part of a long tradition in primary education in the German-speaking world, hardly radical in themselves. Indeed, the famous early-nineteenth-century natural history pedagogue August Lii- ben (whose books were still being used in the 1880s) had advocated many of them, and liberal reformers such as E. A. Rossmassler in the 1850s and 1860s had been touting the same ideas (though apparently to little effect, since the need for reform 17 As Junge put it, "A Lebensgemeinschaft is a totality of beings that live together in accordance with the internal law of maintenance [Erhaltungsmissigkeit] because they exist under the same chemical-physical influences and, moreover, frequently depend on one another, in any case on the whole, and also have an effect on one another and on the whole."

Junge offered numerous reasons for this extreme move. "The elementary school is an institution for general education, not for scholarly [wissenschaftliche] educa- tion. By contrast, ... the [taxonomic] system is a scholarly instrument, which can- not be an end in itself for the school." Scientists need it, as do teachers, to help them keep the enormous volume of facts of nature in order, but regular people do not. Junge continued: if, as many naturalists and teachers have long agreed, the goal for the general school population is to gain an appreciation of the unity of nature, an emphasis on systematics will fail to achieve this goal. Children (and even many teachers) cannot gain an overview of the entire system because it is too large and complex. Moreover, the emphasis on the "logical" unity of the system, according to Junge, requires ripping apart things that belong together in nature: living beings and their settings, form and function, the linked nature of the whole. "Nature itself makes no distinction between organs and their activities, between the existence [das Sein] and the life of a thing." The separation of systematics from physiology and the study of anatomy and physiology based on dead, anatomized bodies make it impossible to study the phenomena of life in any natural way and will yield only broken, sepa- rate shards of knowledge, not an understanding of life as a whole. Finally, children studying systematics quickly lose sight of the whole and thus get bored with the subject, becoming uninterested in pursuing their studies any further on their own. In sum, the traditional structure of teaching natural history through systematics is "unnatural," with regard to both nature and the child.19 In the context of the educational reforms of the time, Junge's opening gambit criticizing existing natural history instruction as formal, unnatural, and overly domi- nated by taxonomic memorization shows him aligning himself with populist and modernizing reformers. These men opposed classical education as overemphasizing rational, logical aspects of learning to elitist ends, and argued instead for an ap- proach that would truly benefit all schoolchildren. Junge's own program sought to achieve such a broadly appealing education by setting the concept of the unity of nature at its center. Repeatedly referring to Alexander von Humboldt, whose state- ment "The richness of science no longer lies in the abundance of facts but in their linkage" he used as an epigraph both for a chapter and for the book as a whole,20 Junge brought specificity to the general concept of a "unified nature" in two ways: through the Lebensgemeinschaft principle itself and through a set of "laws" or prin- ciples of living nature. On the one hand, the manifold connectedness of nature can be found in unities at many levels. One is not required to study all of nature at once to understand its unity and connectedness; rather, these features may be found in individuals and communities. Every organism is a unit made up of coordinated parts that contribute to the whole, and similarly, organisms in a community both depend on and contribute to the maintenance of the whole. Thus by studying individual 18 Ibid., p. 3.

NYHART organisms and their composition into a community it is possible to illustrate the prin- ciple of a whole connected system in a relatively simple, direct, and concrete way. On the other hand, the various modes of connectedness can also be described in the form of regularities or "laws of nature" governing the maintenance of life, which give order and specificity to what might otherwise be a chaos of connections. Draw- ing on a list published in a textbook by the Viennese zoologist Ludwig Schmarda,21 Junge proposed eight laws that he thought should guide the teacher and-when ap- propriate-the students. The most important of these were the first four and the last: 1. The law of maintenance [Erhaltungsmdfiigkeit]: [an organism's] living location, mode of life, and anatomical-physiological apparatus for living all correspond to one another. One can also say: what the animal (the plant) has, it needs to live in this place, and vice-versa: what it needs for its life in this setting are certain organs.... 2. The law of organic harmony: "every being is a link in the whole." ... 3. The law of accommodation or adaptation: mode of life and anatomical-physiological structures adapt themselves (up to a certain degree) to changed conditions, and vice- versa.... This law is a special form of 1).... 4. The law of division of labor and the differentiation of organs.... The more the work of the whole is divided among individual organs, the more perfectly will the work be carried out.... 8. The law of economy [Sparsamkeit] in space and in number. Folding of leaves in the bud, of wings in the insect's pupa; the more intensive the care of the offspring [Brut- pflege], the smaller the number of eggs.22 These biological precepts had been promulgated by professional biologists since midcentury and would come as no surprise to any advanced student of zoology. In the context of school teaching, however, the list took on normative dimensions that would have been far less visible in a university-level scientific textbook, for Junge explicitly sought to use his biological laws as models of lawfulness for school- children. By teaching that the world is a unified whole and that all its members, including humans, are parts of the whole, Junge stated, the child will receive an answer to the most burning question of all: "Who am I in this diversity?" The answer is, "You are a link [Glied] in the whole, you receive and give, you are dependent and have an effect." In case this was not clear enough, Junge elaborated in a footnote: "If a person recognizes himself as a member [Glied] of a community, there follows directly from this realization his rights but also duties toward the other members- thus here toward one's fellow humans."23 Elsewhere in laying out his program, Junge found other occasions to make links between the natural and the human, with the goal of emphasizing harmonious mu- tual support in the service of a larger whole. A husband and a wife, for example, 21 Ludwig K. Schmarda, Zoologie, 2d ed. (Vienna: Wilhelm Braunmuller, 1877), pp. 207-15. It should be noted that Schmarda had quite a few more laws that did not make it into Junge's list, such as the law of chemical composition, the law of conservation of energy, the law of nutrition (every animal requires protein), the law of connection of parts, and various "laws" of form. Although Junge later professed to have derived his laws from Schmarda (DBA 615 [cit. n. 15], pp. 37-50, especially p. 40), similar principles may be found in the works of Rudolf Leuckart from the early 1850s on. See, e.g., Carl Bergmann and Rudolf Leuckart, Anatomisch-physiologische Uebersicht des Thierreichs. Vergleichende Anatomie und Physiologie (Stuttgart: J. B. Miiller, 1852). 22 Junge, Dorfteich (cit. n. 17), pp. 10-13. 23 Ibid., p. viii. 152</page><page sequence="13">TEACHING COMMUNITY VIA BIOLOGY form a kind of community, because each helps out the other to maintain the house- hold as a whole. A city can be viewed as a Lebensgemeinschaft, too. Although the "struggle for existence" [Kampf ums Dasein] and competition may exist "between two members who have absolutely equal living conditions," normally each member, through working to maintain himself or herself, will contribute to the health of the city as a whole. Conversely, when a citizen works directly for the city, this contri- butes back to his or her own well-being. A state is a still more complex community in which the forms of dependence are more intricate and less visible and yet the same: "give and take, the rendering of service and the dependence of the individual" are true here, too.24 Thus although Junge did not press the point further here, it seems pretty clear that in learning that the laws of community were natural, inescapable, and benevolent, children were also supposed to apply those laws to themselves, to practice harmonious adaptation to their circumstances (even when those changed), to understand their occupations as part of a natural system of division of labor, and to exercise thrift in their daily lives. In light of the later intensified subordination of the individual to the state in Nazi ideology, it is tempting to view these prescriptions as profoundly undemocratic and even antimodem. In the context of biirgerlich fears of radicals advocating the revolu- tionary overthrow of the state in the 1880s, however, these messages were more ambiguous. Although we lack direct evidence on Junge's politics, his entire back- ground suggests that he stood in the liberal part of the political spectrum. His third law, "accommodation" showed acceptance of change to be part of nature. His em- phasis on duty to others was balanced by an emphasis on individual development; his theory considered an individual's striving for his or her own self-maintenance to contribute naturally to the good of the whole; and his idea that all individuals con- tribute to the welfare of the whole could be viewed as valorizing all kinds of work, including industrial labor. In addition, as we will see, his emphasis on observation and hands-on experience aimed at teaching children that individual observation, tempered by logical judgment, was the key to secure knowledge; thus it was under- stood that individuals make their own knowledge, rather than simply receive it from a higher authority.25 That his program lent itself to different socio-political read- ings at the time is evident from its reception, to be discussed in later sections of the paper. In his program for teaching, then, Junge blended a number of important ingredi- ents: an emphasis on the biology of the living organism in relation to its organic and inorganic surroundings (as opposed to focusing on formal characteristics and the memorization of taxonomic names and relationships) coupled with a pedagogy that took children away from book learning to living nature; a sustained vision of organic harmony mediated through the subordination of parts to a larger whole; and a com- mitment to education as a moral enterprise whose goal was to raise children into upright members of society. Each of these programmatic elements struck a chord with others in the broader teaching community. 24 Ibid., p. 33. 25 See, especially, Junge, Naturgeschichte. II.

THE SPREAD OF THE DORFTEICH GOSPEL Junge's program circulated with incredible speed through the ranks of schoolteach- ers in the 1880s. As a curriculum that crossed over between the higher and lower schools, it made its way into the hands of reformers at both levels (though as we shall see, his program appealed more to teachers in the lower schools). Some teach- ers evidently picked up on Junge's initial presentations in four 1883 articles, while others read the book itself.26 Still others learned about it either through the well- developed systems of teachers' meetings or through reading reports on the meetings in the pedagogical press, which also published numerous reviews of the book and other books that engaged with it. These forums for communication show how the tools of the public sphere could be used in the service of educational reform; they also reveal just how segregated the communities of higher and lower school teachers were from one another. Lower school teachers and their own instructors in the seminaries received Junge's program in the context of associations devoted to pedagogy or to improving teach- ers' social and economic standing, such as the Allgemeiner deutscher Lehrerverein (General German Teachers' Association). In addition to discussing pedagogical is- sues, this association worked tirelessly to remove lower school teachers from local confessional oversight and place them under a secular school administration system, to improve wages and death benefits, and to improve the educational opportunities for teachers. In 1886 Junge's book was presented at the Leipzig Teachers' Associa- tion meeting as part of a lecture reviewing the recent Volksschule literature and at the Silesian Pestalozzi and Provincial Teachers' Association, where the assembled audience voted in support of the reviewer's theses, which demanded reform in na- tural history teaching along the lines Junge advocated. In 1887 his ideas were dis- cussed at the annual meeting of the Verein fur wissenschaftliche Padagogik (Associ- ation for Scientific Pedagogy), which met that year in Leipzig, and at the annual national meeting of seminary teachers in Eisleben, near Halle, where the presenta- tion of Junge's ideas elicited a lively discussion. Those who could not attend the meetings could learn about them in such pedagogical journals as the Deutsche Blat- terfiir erziehenden Unterricht, which not only reported on these meetings but also reviewed the literature. Eduard Scheller gave the Dorfteich great press in this teach- ing reform journal, concluding his review of it by saying that it was an unprece- dented book that would become "a milestone in the development of natural history instruction."27 26 The articles were Junge, "Sollen Gesetze des organischen Lebens im Volksschulunterricht vor- kommen?

Aphorismen." (Erziehungsschule 1883, no. 7).

DB 154</page><page sequence="15">TEACHING COMMUNITY VIA BIOLOGY Word spread quickly by other means as well. In 1887 Otto Frick, leader of the movement for unified schooling, opened his series "Schriften des Deutschen Ein- heitsschulvereins" with a monograph that advocated Junge's Lebensgemeinschaft as the best approach to teaching nature study. Already that year a newly published natural history textbook could tout itself in its subtitle as following "the new me- thodical principles of treatment and organization (Lebensgemeinschaften)," and by 1889 a tired reviewer could refer to the Lebensgemeinschaft principle as having "instantly become a kind of dogma."28 In 1892, at the annual meeting of the General Saxon Teachers' Association, a group of Dresden teachers took the calls for reform one step further, displaying an exhibit that illustrated how to use visual aids to teach about Lebensgemeinschaften, using the River Elbe near Dresden as its key biotic community.29 By 1894, nine years after the publication of the Dorfteich and eleven years after Junge's ideas first saw print, an advocate of his program could afford to skip over the meaning of Lebensgemeinschaft "since the majority of readers cer- tainly know long since" about it.30 Although the original title of Junge's book, Naturgeschichte in der Volksschule, suggested an intended audience of elementary teachers, the work almost immedi- ately began to reach teachers in the higher schools, more often, it appears, through their journals than through teachers' meetings. In 1886, in the first volume of the new review journal Jahresbericht uber das hohere Schulwesen (Annual report on the higher school system), Junge's book was flagged with the comment that his idea of "Lebensgemeinschaften-that is, a group of animals that stand in biological con- nection to one another- ... deserves careful scrutiny." (And indeed, in the second edition of Junge's book, the title was changed to read simply Naturgeschichte, re- flecting a broadening of its audience.)31 In September 1887 news of Junge's program reached perhaps the most prestigious site for higher school teachers, the annual Meeting of German Scientists and Physicians (where schoolteachers rubbed shoul- ders with university professors); at the section for science education there, a school- teacher from Strasbourg gave a lecture advocating Junge's community-oriented ped- agogical structure, which was then picked up by the pedagogical review literature.32 That same year, J.

Although disappointed in the lack of time allotted to discussion (as he reported to higher school science teachers in the pages of his journal), the book's warm reception later moved him to obtain a copy and read it closely. In 1889 he offered his own review of it under the title "A New Gospel of Natural History Instruction," opening his essay with the remark that "Among all the works that have been written recently on natural history, none have provoked so much attention, so many opinions, lectures and journal articles, as that of the Kiel head teacher (school director) Junge." Why, Hoffmann went on to ask, should such a work be reviewed in a journal devoted primarily to mathematical articles? Because Junge's work reaches so deeply into the issues of natural history education that "they should not remain unattended to by the higher schools. For much, indeed most, of what the author says is applicable to the lower and middle classes of the higher schools... ."33 And to girls' schools and their female teachers as well, it seems: in 1893 at the second annual meeting of the Deutsche Lehrerinnenverein (German Women Teachers' Association), Helene Sumper, its Munich-based cofounder, deliv- ered a talk on the value of the Lebensgemeinschaft reform idea.34 Within a decade of its appearance, then, the Dorfteich had succeeded in capturing the attention of teachers at different kinds of schools across Germany, from Kiel in the north to Munich in the south, from Strasbourg on the western front to the Silesian town of Sagan in the east. What was it that made this book such a lightning rod for discussion of reform? Despite the novelty claimed for it, the degree of interest surely must have derived from strong existing currents within the educational community. One aspect of this interest, largely absent from the content of the discussions them- selves but present in their very existence, was the opportunity it gave teachers to weigh in publicly on matters of reform. In a system in which the numbers of class hours, curricular guidelines, and even sanctioned behavior were mandated from above, reform-minded teachers seized at opportunities provided by meetings and journals to assert their independence and their right to shape what went on in the classroom. In Prussia, in 1879, the new, conservative education minister had publicly discouraged teachers from attending the independent teachers' associations, promot- ing instead official "school conferences" under the oversight of the state; this made the act of speaking out at the teachers' associations even more clearly an assertion of political independence, indeed, defiance.35 There and in some other states, moreover, 33 J.

Junge's reform program, requiring schoolteachers to draw on their own experience and understand- ing of local natural communities, was especially suited to claims for the necessity of schoolteachers' autonomy from higher powers. It would be going overboard, however, to argue that these open associational dis- cussions constituted explicit efforts at free and democratic participation in the for- mation of the curriculum. These meetings and journals were almost exclusively pro- fessional venues, ones closed to other voices, such as those of parents. Not all meetings were even open to all teachers: women were excluded from many teachers' associations (resulting in the development of separate female teachers' associations). Yet despite these limitations, it still can be argued that the meetings and the publica- tions opened up discussion of a highly political subject to a broader segment of society. Teachers lacked the respect or power accorded Germany's traditional profes- sional classes; they had neither the social and legal standing nor the access to state influence that university professors and other professionals had. The associations thus offered one viable way of seeking to effect change.36 As we will see in the next two sections, the Dorfteich also spoke directly to two significant currents among teaching reformers: the need to bring the curriculum in natural history up to date with moder scientific and pedagogical developments, a concern expressed by reformers at all educational levels; and the interest in educa- tion for moral character, which was understood to relate to both Christian tenets and political-economic ones-concerns especially significant to Volksschule teachers. It is to these topics we now turn. IV. MODERNIZING THE BIOLOGY CURRICULUM Proponents of reforming natural history education faced an uphill battle. For reasons of both structure and ideology, natural history was something of a curricular step- child in most German schools. Because of the great variation of grade levels in the Volksschulen and the lack of uniform state oversight, the curricula for these schools varied widely and patterns are hard to detect; anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that natural history generally had a limited place in a school system focusing on the basic elements of reading, writing, arithmetic, and religion. Similarly, it appears that the teaching seminaries that instructed Volksschule teachers paid little attention to the sciences, concentrating instead on pedagogy, basic skills, religion, and instruc- tion in auxiliary skills, such as organ playing, that were likely to be required of a parish schoolteacher.3 At the higher school levels, patterns are easier to detect; here the evidence is stronger that natural history was not viewed as a serious requirement. ibid., pp. 93-104; and Werner Sacher, "Lehrerfortbildung im Spannungsfeld zwischen Staat und Lehrerorganisation," ibid., pp. 105-20. 36 On the professionalizing aspect of school reform among Volksschule teachers, see Becker and Kluchert, Die Bildung der Nation (cit. n. 5), pp. 87-90. 37 In his autobiography the natural history reformer Otto Schmeil described his request to teach in a city school rather than a village school so that he would not have to take up the position of organist, "which was tied to the school post in most villages."

NYHART Among those struggling to reform the curriculum, modem languages and German history took priority over the sciences, and in the sciences, mathematics and the physical sciences generally took priority over biology. Although the situation for natural history was slightly better in the Realschulen and Realgymnasien, even there physics, chemistry, and mathematics, bolstered by the strong support of the German engineering profession, gained most of the time conceded by the classical lan- guages.38 Those who wished for more time for botany and zoology in the lesson plan, and who desired coverage of these subjects to continue through the highest grade levels, found their efforts complicated by the longstanding association of biology with ma- terialism, antireligious sentiment, and political radicalism, stretching back to the radicals of 1848 and reinforced by Darwinism since the early 1860s. The claims of botany and zoology to curricular time were not helped by Germany's most famous Darwinian, Ernst Haeckel, who in 1877 notoriously argued for replacing religious instruction in the schools with instruction in evolutionary monism. Nor did natural history teaching reformers benefit from the scandal extending from 1876 to 1879 over Hermann Miiller's teaching Darwinian theory to his high school class. This widely publicized event led Prussia's cultural minister to announce that teachers were not to teach evolution in their classrooms, and when new curricular guidelines came out in 1882, biology had been removed entirely from the upper grade levels of the Prussian Gymnasium, strictures that came to be known collectively as the "ban on biology" (Biologieverbot).39 Henceforth, natural history instruction was confined to the lower and middle school grades. Only in 1891 did the tide begin to turn: in the new Prussian regulations, although natural history instruction actually lost further ground in terms of hours taught in the official higher curriculum, for the first time it was mandated that schools take into account instruction in animal geog- raphy and "biology" (understood then as the study of the dynamic relations of organ- isms to their natural surroundings), and teachers were encouraged to introduce out- door instruction, especially field trips, as part of their curriculum. These were the first formal effects of the biology teaching reform movement in the higher schools; although superficially minor, they signaled a significant change in perspective from the old approach and may be understood as the first fruits of the reform associated with Junge's name.40 Further changes would come gradually through the first half of the twentieth century. 38 On the history of natural history education, see Irmtraut Scheele, Von Luben bis Schmeil: Die Entwicklung von der Schulnaturgeschichte zum Biologieunterricht zwischen 1830 und 1933 (Berlin: Dietrich Reimer, 1981); on the role of the German engineering profession in the high school curricu- lum debates, see Becker and Kluchert, Bildung der Nation, p. 77; Albisetti, Secondary School Reform (both cit. n. 5), p. 92ff. 39 Ernst Haeckel, "Uber die heutige Entwicklungslehre im Verhaltnisse zur Gesamtwissenschaft," Amtlicher Bericht der 50.

This "modernizing" side of his program had multiple aspects that appealed differently to teachers at different levels and were subject to considerable modification by other reformers. Junge's advocacy of learning from living nature was hardly new in the 1880s, but his call to increase attention to visual and hands- on learning in natural history was in line with more recent, similar calls from educa- tional psychologists and advocates of a more moder curriculum. The expansion of the Realfdcher after 1872 was not just a matter of adding "moder" subjects to the school curriculum; it was also seen as developing a different set of the child's sense perceptions and mental faculties-those visual, tactile, and mental operations suited to understanding the material world. The increasing commerce in classroom visual aids, demonstration equipment, and ever more elaborately illustrated textbooks testi- fies to the success of this pedagogical trend. Underlying this claim was the deeper epistemological and ethical claim that direct observation of nature could supply children with a secure moral foundation in a world filled with superstition and misinformation. Thus one reformer wrote in 1885, the same year Junge's Dorfteich was published, that natural history education was often mistakenly blamed for spreading materialism in the schools. Au contraire! The bedrock of natural history is observation, which keeps "thought in strict discipline," forms the foundation of "correct judgments," "suppresses superstition, and promotes the sense of truth of the youth." Contact with nature, moreover, has "a moderating effect, it dampens the passions and supports calm and clear judgments about our- selves and our near and dear."41 Junge himself echoed these thoughts in the second volume of his Naturgeschichte, published in 1891. Natural history, he wrote, "is no place for opinion-the superstitious opine that they have seen ghosts, which then disappear upon serious investigation. How many 'scientific' ghosts in recent times have gone up in smoke upon closer research, substantial observation!"42 Junge and other advocates of natural history instruction, then, assumed that children were not simply memorizers of information handed down to them, but individuals who exer- cised their own judgment in coming to their views of the true and the good. The value of an observation-based approach was that it disciplined students' thinking away from the dangers of speculation and toward the practice of sound judgment- an essential skill in an age when the temptations of Darwinism, atheism, and social- ism lurked around every corer. In addition to its greater emphasis on visual and hands-on learning, Junge's peda- gogy also dovetailed with those seeking to develop patriotic and preservationist sen- timents through the study of the local homeland, or Heimatkunde. As the Heimat- kunde movement began to take off in the late 1880s, teachers found it a useful way of economizing in school hours, since it could be used to combine the study of lo- cal history and geography with natural history. Junge's program, with its emphasis on studying local nature, could be adapted by those seeking to develop chil- dren's knowledge and love of their natural and historical surroundings, especially through the use of field trips. Moreover, in the face of a landscape that was becoming 41 Bergemann, "Was hat die Schule zu thun" (cit. n. 11), pp. 536-44, on pp. 536-40. 42 Junge, Naturgeschichte. II (cit. n. 25), p. v. 159</page><page sequence="20">LYNN K. NYHART increasingly degraded by industrial growth and pollution, the study of the natural Hei- mat in terms of Lebensgemeinschaften could be used to promote a sense of a natural balance of nature that should be preserved through conservation and beautification measures. In urban areas, many children's ignorance of the most basic facts of nature offered an added incentive for this method of study. An 1882 book reported that of 1,000 Berlin schoolchildren surveyed, only 364 had seen a forest or woods and only 167 recognized the song of a lark; these figures were repeated in other publications and reinforced by later surveys of urban children. On the basis of similar experience, many teachers advocated using field trips to familiarize students with nature and to teach them to value German natural places and beings as part of the German her- itage.43 Although Junge's pedagogy thus resonated with various reform efforts among ele- mentary school teachers, his scientific principles met with more resistance. A major reason offered was that they were too difficult. Many critics agreed that Junge's laws were simply beyond the reach of nine- to thirteen-year-olds, and the Lebensgemein- schaft concept itself was sometimes judged too complex. For instance, one writer, though announcing in the subtitle of his textbook that he was following the new methodological program of Lebensgemeinschaften, actually found Junge's notion of natural communities too difficult for students (and perhaps for teachers) and simpli- fied it into a broader notion of grouping organisms by their natural settings or Lebensbilder (life pictures), such as the woods or the meadow; an 1888 pamphlet on natural history reform followed suit, the author preferring the simpler approach of presenting animals and plants in a common setting. In such ways, Junge's program was adapted and watered down. By the 1890s many elementary teachers were using Lebensgemeinschaften or related words such as Lebensbilder to refer to a nature study that de-emphasized systematics and was generally oriented toward presenting organisms in their environment, but was not necessarily focused on the biological- functional relationships at the heart of Junge's curriculum.44 43 On the Heimat movement, see Celia Applegate, A Nation of Provincials: The German Idea of Heimat (Berkeley and Los Angeles: Univ. of California Press, 1990); and Alon Confino, The Nation as a Local Metaphor: Wiirttemberg, Imperial Germany, and National Memory, 1871-1918 (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1997). For an example of how different topics were combined in a Heimatkunde curriculum, see R. Gentsch, "Heimatskunde. Lehr- und Stoffplan fur eine vierstufige Volksschule," DB 16 (1889): 329-30, 336-7, 344-5, 353-4, 360-2, 367-9. The statistics on igno- rance of nature come from Ernst Pilz, Uber Naturbeobachtung des Schiilers (Weimar: Bohlau, 1882), quoted in Bergemann, "Was hat die Schule zu thun" (cit. n. 11), p. 540. Another widely publicized survey in 1896 revealed that some 40% of 150 twelve- to fourteen-year-olds at an urban elementary school had never been in the woods and 56% had never heard a nightingale sing: Otto Schmeil, Uber die Reformbestrebungen auf dem Gebiete des naturgeschichtlichen Unterrichts, 4th ed. (Stuttgart: Niigele, 1900), pp. 74-5; originally published in 1897. It should be noted that the Lebensgemein- schaft concept used by Germans easily accommodated humans-although it could be associated with Heimatkunde and nature preservation, it was not used primarily in the service of preserving a past "primitive" nature untouched by human hands. On the inclusion of humans in Lebensge- meinschaften, consider the title (and contents) of Junge, Naturgeschichte. II.

De- spite Junge's own clear interpretation that these laws would lead children to under- stand that laws in general were natural and therefore needed to be followed, critics worried that the presentation of laws to young students would lead immature minds down the primrose path of deductivism toward the dangerous terrain of specula- tion.45 Following Haeckel's bombastic publicity stunts and the Miiller affair, many schoolteachers became skittish about departing from facts; anything smacking of theoretical speculation, of knowledge not firmly grounded in facts, threatened to lead students into skepticism and wild philosophizing-ways of thinking clearly dangerous in the eyes of a religiously minded society and a politically conservative state. Indeed, Junge reported that his own school inspector believed the Dorfteich could be used to promote atheism and pantheism, and had therefore opposed it. Junge protested that his laws were made mainly for the teacher and should be con- veyed to students only if and when the teacher thought they were ready, and then only in very simple language. In the second volume of the Naturgeschichte, he ar- gued explicitly that proper natural history teaching, based on observation and induc- tion, taught students to put the brakes on speculation and theorizing.46 Whichever way one interpreted Junge's laws, it is clear that a central concern for elementary teachers was avoiding the potent association of natural history with radicalism. For university-educated teachers in the higher schools, both the appeal and the limitations of Junge's program were probably somewhat different. In contrast to teachers in the elementary schools, where pedagogical goals took a front seat, teach- ers in the higher schools were more likely to model their instruction on the universi- ties', paying less attention to pedagogy. Those who had taken university courses in zoology and botany would have been likely to learn a functional approach to these subjects that examined the relations between an organism's form, the functions its various structures performed, and its conditions of existence-an approach that has been called "functional morphology" and at the time was often called "scientific" botany or zoology. These instructors would undoubtedly have learned something about evolutionary theory, and they would have been oriented toward a systematics infused with evolutionary meaning. Depending on where they had studied, they might have paid some attention to biogeography as well.47 Thus the biological- functional aspects of Junge's proposal would probably have been easier for them to view as appropriate for teaching their pupils, and his emphasis on studying the living organism in situ, too, would have been in line with at least one prominent strand of university-level biology. Higher school teachers also tended to adapt Junge's Lebensgemeinschaft concept to their own needs. For instance, in an 1893 essay Carl Matzdorff, who taught at the Lessing-Gymnasium in Berlin, advocated field trips, school gardens, and classroom experiments to study the "biological" qualities of organisms-their structures and functions, and their relationships to their surroundings; he used the Lebensge- meinschaft concept to draw together material at the end of a series of lessons. In 1895 Ernst Loew, an Oberlehrer at the royal Realschule in Berlin who was an expert 45 E.

NYHART in the relations between insects and blossoming plants, praised Junge while re- minding readers of the less rigorous and so more practicable principle he had devel- oped, which he called the "biocentric viewpoint;' in which organisms occupying the same setting would be studied together (for example, forest plants and animals) in situ. Similarly, Otto Schmeil, a schoolteacher who had worked his way up the social and educational scale to receive a university degree, and who would become the most successful German biological textbook writer of the early twentieth century, liked the thrust of Junge's reforms but thought they went too far. Schmeil was unwill- ing to abandon the traditional taxonomic structure for school natural history teach- ing; rather than organizing his textbooks around biotic communities, he integrated information about an animal's way of life into the chapter sections on each animal, within a larger taxonomic chapter structure that descended from the mammals down to the single-celled animals.48 Reviewing the situation in 1893, Egon Ihne wrote that "in Volksschule teaching Junge's method seems to have found many followers ..., but it does not appear that it will have such a successful arrival in the higher schools."49 While this claim has some merit, it overstates the case. If a curriculum organized around the Lebensge- meinschaft idea per se met with less success in the higher schools, many of Junge's pedagogical and scientific principles were nevertheless carried over, and the atten- tion given to the Dorfteich makes it seem probable that his reform program gave impetus to teaching reforms there. In particular, following upon Junge's suggestions, pedagogical discussions on both subject matter and teaching methods-especially regarding field trips, school gardens, and laboratory exercises-are significantly more visible in the 1890s and early 1900s than they were earlier. It seems plausible that the Dorfteich helped to strengthen the resolve of higher school teachers to re- form their pedagogy. There can be no doubt, in any case, that by the turn of the century, both higher and lower schools had shifted from teaching "natural history" with a focus on taxonomy, terminology, and the separate study of plants and animals to teaching "biology" as an integrated science of living things. V. BIOLOGY INSTRUCTION AS MORAL EDUCATION If Junge's program appealed to some reformist schoolteachers because of its mod- ernizing pedagogical tendencies and biological content, these aspects (especially the content) remained controversial; therefore alone they were probably not enough to ensure his program's success. Although earlier analyses of Junge's work have not called particular attention to this aspect, I will argue here that a crucial feature of his program lay in its use of nature as a model for human social behavior and thus 48 Carl Matzdorff, "Uber lebende Anschauungsmittel im naturwissenschaftlichen Unterricht," in Wissenschaftliche Beilage zum 11.

It is thus useful to understand something of the aims and methods of this program.51 The movement for erziehenden Unterricht, or "character-building instruction," was led by the theorist Tuiskon Ziller, following the precepts of the earlier educa- tionist Johann Friedrich Herbart. In contrast to the liberal Pestalozzian tradition car- ried forward by Diesterweg, which sought to educate all children to reach their own potential in whatever direction they went, the Herbart-Ziller school took the conser- vative view that the object of primary education was to direct the developing will of children toward moral virtue, so that the child was "enabled independently to take his part in the work of the people"52 According to Herbart, developing the will to know, or deep-seated "interestedness" in the world, rather than conferring disciplin- ary knowledge itself, was an essential element of this education toward virtue. In the 1860s and 1870s Ziller reoriented this approach more explicitly toward religious and moral education, combining it with another popular midcentury curricular nov- elty known as "concentration." This approach sought to center instruction on one goal, such as a topic or a mode of thought, and then structure different formal and disciplinary aspects of instruction, such as writing, reading, drawing, and natural history, all around this goal. Applying the concentration idea to the goal of devel- oping moral character, Ziller took the view that all instruction must be moral- religious instruction, and many of his followers argued that the teaching of reading, writing, history, natural history, singing, drawing, and so forth, should be "concen- trated" on Bible stories or other lessons in Christianity.53 Although many educators found this position extreme and developed less one-sided classroom approaches, the Herbart-Ziller goal of character education nevertheless had a profound impact on pedagogy in the elementary schools. This movement of education for character building, which was especially influen- tial in Germany's Protestant schools, and which grew in prominence in response to the increasing threat of socialism, provided the predominant pedagogical milieu for Junge's program. Early in his work on the Dorfteich, Junge was encouraged in his reformist views by Eduard Scheller, one of the main supporters of the Deutsche 50 Gerhard Trommer discusses the significance of Junge's links to the Herbart-Ziller movement for character education but concentrates on the implications for nature protection rather than its social and political implications.

NYHART Blatterfiir erziehenden Unterricht (hereafter cited as DB), a leading Herbartian jour- nal, and Junge would publish numerous articles in this journal during the 1880s.54 In 1883 he concluded his "Sketch for a syllabus for instruction in natural history for the first girls' Biirgerschule in Kiel" published in the DB, with the rousing statement that his curriculum organized around Lebensgemeinschaften showed how "natural history can be viewed as a main branch of moral-religious instruction."55 Although natural history could support moral instruction in many ways, the aspect perhaps most resonant with the program of character education was Junge's empha- sis on teaching the child to accept limits on personal freedom in order to become a productive member of society. Even more starkly than in the Dorfteich, in the article sketching out his reformed natural history curriculum, Junge emphasized that the Lebensgemeinschaft concept helped children learn that "a properly conducted in- struction in natural history shows the human, too, but not as a freely trading [frei- hindelnden] individual, but as a link [Glied] in a series of innumerable creations. To be sure, he stands at the top of the chain of being, but he also finds a physical world-order and feels that he is subject to the same laws as every other individual; as a being in nature, he is dependent on nature as a whole and on her often minute parts. But [the child's] self-consciousness cannot recognize a dependence upon raw forces and lower beings that are often unknown to him; [this consciousness] de- mands a higher, goal-oriented will, to which he voluntarily submits himself."56 Here the shaping of the individual will toward the good of the whole, the education of the child toward a view of the self as independent and yet also dependent, may best be understood in the context of Herbartian education and its broader conservative political agenda. Junge taught this lesson not only through the content of natural history teaching but also through instructional practices. In another early article in the DB on the best way to run field trips, he discussed how they could be used to underline the necessity of subordinating the individual to the group. "Give children rules of behav- ior, but only the most necessary ones, and avoid any appearance of imperative arbi- trariness; rather show them the necessity of these measures. 'Ask yourself if each of you 40, 50, 60 pupils could do what you are thinking of doing without fear of creating disorder'-this is the main rule that each pupil must carry within him- self...." Children must "learn the necessity of recognizing the factual limitation of personal freedom" and learn it in their very bodies, not just in their minds. Junge also advocated "cultivating a communal spirit [Gemeingeist]" such that when some- one makes mischief students would learn to think, not "X did that," but "one of J's students did that. You and you and I, we are all responsible."57 Junge's work thus provided reinforcement in the realm of natural history for teach- ing one of the chief social virtues of German character-building education: Gemein- sinn, or the "sense of community," a virtue valued by Germans across the political 54 "Friedrich Junge' DBA 615 (cit. n. 15), pp. 45-6. 55 Junge, "Entwurf eines Pensenplans" (cit. n. 26), p. 271. 56 Ibid., p. 252. 57 Friedrich Junge, "Was ist zur Ausfiihrung von Exkursionen zu beachten?"

An article on Gemeinsinn in the 1896 Enzyklopddisches Handbuch der Pddagogik, for instance, started off by proclaiming, "Man can never be an absolute whole. What he is, even at the highest level of earthly perfection, he is thanks to- after God and his own efforts-society [Gesellschaft] in its widest sense, whose member [Glied] he is .... The greater the sense of community, the greater the com- mon good. [Je mehr Gemeinsinn, desto mehr Gemeinwohl.]" Like other articles on various social virtues in this encyclopedia, the article went on to elaborate at length on how to "educate for the sense of community"58 The devotion to community was a virtue especially resonant among the broader community of schoolteachers concerned with raising a new generation of working- class children who would eventually be able to vote; the thrust of this education was to inculcate in them a sense of appropriate behavior and citizenship that would direct them away from antistate activities. At the seventh German teacher's conference in 1888, for example, in a speech on "The Introduction of Legal Studies and Econom- ics [Volkswirtschaftslehre] in the Schools," the vocational-school advocate Oskar Pache argued that one of the first things a child learns in his family is "to subordinate himself to a communal [gemeinschaftlichen] principle and to work for the realiza- tion of the principles that animate the family. The principle of the family frequently forces its individual members, on their own volition, to deny their own rights for the good of the whole, and in this way the community achieves its own right, its own life; it becomes an independent personality that encompasses the individuals that belong to it." This principle is repeated at the level of the parish [Gemeinde], the state, and indeed, in any corporate entity to which people choose to belong. "No human can escape this tendency of association [Zusammenhang] among individuals, and community life is as indispensable for him as light, air, and the earth."59 Pache focused his speech on two principal Gemeinschaften: the state and society. Following a long tradition in German political theory, Pache argued that the object of the state is "the elevation of every individual to the greatest possible freedom"- something which was already on its way with the introduction of a constitution, an independent administration, and the more recent expansion of voting rights. But at the same time, the state can only function properly (and so guarantee the freedom of the individual) when its citizens subordinate their wills to it.60 The point for the education of the masses was that they should learn how the state functions, how its parts work, and what role they as voters play in it. It is part of the job of the teaching profession to convey to citizens the seriousness of their role, "that the participation in public affairs is in no way an exciting and stimulating sport, but a serious job laden with meaning."61 The other great "organism" to which the common people belonged was the eco- nomic one, one that was no longer simply national, but global. In this regard, the job of the teacher was to help the people understand the interconnectedness of every part of the economy, to understand that "for the sure and successful operation of 58 A.

NYHART the great global economy the conscientious activity of every single member is required...." According to Pache, the goal of the study of economics, then, is to demonstrate "how the entire working life can thrive only when the necessary unity of all the participating elements reigns, when every single member of the gigantic organism fulfills his daily work punctually and faithfully, that for the happy develop- ment of the whole every area of work is necessary and important, that there is no such thing as a superfluous and insignificant job... ." Finally, economics instruction should also develop "the sense for lawfulness [Gesetzlichkeit] and the law [Recht]" in two ways: it should impart knowledge of "the most important regulations that one absolutely must know to live in the civic community [burgerliche Gemeinschaft]" and it should teach the "laws" of production and consumption in connection with drawing up a family budget.62 As in Junge's work, published three years earlier, Pache's concept of Gemeinschaft was a nested one that operated at several levels, from the family up to the state and the world economy. Like Junge, Pache saw the educator's job to be to help pupils answer the question "Where do I fit into the larger picture?" The answer to that question emphasized duty to others and a valorization of "simple work" through an organismal model in which all parts contributed to the welfare of the whole. Furthermore, both men also emphasized the need to impart an understanding of the necessity to subordinate one's will to "laws," where this term conjoined a philosophi- cal sense of "law," as a principle that was unbreachable because it operated in nature, with the legal sense and the sense of moral obligation to obey the laws of the state. As the case of Pache suggests, the values articulated by Junge resonated well with those being advocated elsewhere in the community of teachers supporting charac- ter education. Junge was hardly alone among teachers of natural history in projecting the social values of devotion to work, service to and benefit from the community, and eco- nomic interdependence onto the natural realm. Junge himself was quite restrained in how he did this, simply reminding children of the analogies between nature and human community values. In his exposition of the natural community and its mem- bers, his laws and their consequences stayed largely at the level of biological and biophysical relationships, with only pointers to "compare with human situations";63 it was up to the teacher to make explicit the connections in the classroom-or not. Many Lebensgemeinschaft enthusiasts were not so restrained and wrote in much more anthropomorphic tones. The natural history textbook author Odo Twiehausen, for instance, wrote that the starling acted as the "policeman" of the garden and field, the bullfinch was the "nobleman" among the finches, the sparrow was the beg- garman. Taking such analogies even further, Junge's own colleague Groth in Kiel described the woodpecker as a "carpenter," the owl as a "night watchman," the heron as a "fisherman," and the domestic chicken as a "careful housewife." Each lived in its own particular setting; each had its own job, for which it was equipped with appropriate tools (its body structures); and each received appropriate rewards for its work: "To the heron the fish, to the hen the seed corn, to the owl the mouse, to the woodpecker the larva is a piece of gold." Moreover, none could do the work of another: "How could the heron manage the work of a woodpecker and the hen do 62 Ibid., pp. 203, 219. 63 See e.g., Junge, Dorfteich (cit. n. 17), p. 95, on the salamander. 166</page><page sequence="27">TEACHING COMMUNITY VIA BIOLOGY the service of the owl! Each must come itself. Among them it is said: he who doesn't work, doesn't eat. But he who works will have enough food for himself and his family."64 Junge's program, then, could easily be used by those seeking to hammer home moral lessons about humans by turning nature into a field of conservative parables, and it is tempting to see this as a main feature of his appeal. But we must be cautious about viewing Junge himself as too completely a follower of the Herbart-Ziller school. Although he shared with it the goal of educating children toward a moral upbringing, Junge rejected a more extreme tenet associated with the school in the 1880s: complete concentration around religious subject matter. In the first place, he wanted natural history instruction to maintain an independent place in the curricu- lum. His adaptation of "concentration" lay in combining botany with zoology and (to a lesser degree) the study of the inorganic aspects of the environment, and he opposed the subordination of natural history to religious instruction.65 In addition, he appears not to have wanted to alienate teachers who held more liberal worldviews. In a provocative footnote in the Dorfteich, Junge wrote that he was not surprised that some people had read into his earlier publications a bent toward materialism or pantheism. However, he continued, such people would be mistaken, for he was writ- ing only about natural history teaching, "which as such has nothing to do with reli- gious instruction. And here the results could certainly be used to justify a materialis- tic, pantheistic, darwinistic-and who knows, what else-worldview, but also a deistic one. That depends entirely upon the teacher. But whoever maintains that my instruction must lead to religious error isn't paying any attention [steht gar nicht in der Sache]; such a person can say anything about anything."66 Thus Junge's curricu- lum by no means ruled out its use by people who wanted to adapt it to a variety of ideological ends; indeed, Junge's statement suggests that in his view, as science the curriculum was neutral. This footnote offers an important clue to understanding Junge's impact and sug- gests how his program served a mediating function. Andreas Daum has written of the "element of reconciliation" evident in popular natural history around 1900, arguing persuasively that a conciliatory interpretation of evolution, which emphasized the perfection resulting from evolution and de-emphasized struggle and competition, was an important feature of the decades around the turn of the century.67 Junge's program may be viewed as another, earlier kind of "biology of reconciliation"-one that made the reconciliation of worldviews possible through its silence on the subject of evolution. Despite the importance of the context of moral education for Junge's work, his silence regarding the causes of adaptation allowed it to move beyond the (already wide) circle of religious proponents of character education.

NYHART leaning toward natural theology and those leaning toward either a deist or a material- ist understanding of evolution could embrace Junge's program and teach it as they chose. Junge's program, though existing comfortably within the context of Protes- tant character-building education, provided a basis from which people could drive home quite different lessons concerning the ultimate causes of the regularities to be found in nature. Character education provided a significant touchstone for Junge's program, and, I would argue, the context of moral education, as a powerful force for stability against the socialist threat, goes a long way toward explaining his appeal in the 1880s and the 1890s. By placing natural history within this context, Junge seems to have hoped to rescue natural history from the taint of socialism and antistate political activity, placing it instead in the service of creating dutiful citizens and workers. Thus one "reconciling" quality of his program was to reconcile children to their place in life by showing their value to the system as a whole. At the same time, by asserting the need for an independent place for natural history in the curriculum, and by refusing to abjure evolutionary ideas, he kept his program open to those who might want to use it for more liberal ends. Here again, I would argue, we can see an act of media- tion, one that provided common ground for many kinds of natural history teachers and contributed in turn to the program's success. CONCLUSION The story of Junge's Lebensgemeinschaft program and its reception in Germany in- vites three kinds of concluding reflections. First, it is worth underscoring that in the discourse of biology teaching reformers in late-nineteenth-century Germany, al- though the terms "civil society" (burgerliche Gesellschaft) (or more often, simply "society") and "state" had a place, reformers seem to have been less interested in maintaining or using the distinctions between them than in searching out metaphors of mediation and analogies that emphasized their interpenetration. The concepts of Gemeinschaft and Lebensgemeinschaft served this function well, for they were pre- sented as embodying natural relationships that could be understood to operate at many levels, from the unit of husband and wife to the state or even the world econ- omy. This nested quality of analogies between microcosm and macrocosm empha- sized what was similar among all of these relationships over what was different about them and served to reinforce the idea that the stability of society and that of the state went hand in hand.68 This emphasis on commonality and mediation is espe- cially noteworthy since it was occurring just as Ferdinand Tonnies was developing his contrast between Gemeinschaft as an "organic" form of social organization that was older, more primitive, and closer to nature and Gesellschaft as a "mechanical" form that was, however regrettably, indelibly modern.69 If Tonnies's Gemeinschaft resembles Junge's Lebensgemeinschaft in its organic web of relationships, there ap- pears to be no contrasting equivalent to Tonnies's Gesellschaft in the sphere of teach- ing reform. Rather, children were to be taught to act and live in a society that retained 68 It is worth noting that exactly this same ambiguity holds for another popular movement of the time, Heimatkunde.

Press, 1957). 168</page><page sequence="29">TEACHING COMMUNITY VIA BIOLOGY the moral features of a Gemeinschaft, the most prominent of which was the Gemein- sinn, or "sense of community," and the virtue of service to others. Second, the ways in which the Gemeinschaft concept glossed over differences between state and society invite us to reflect on the ambiguous position of teachers themselves vis-a-vis these two categories. Because they were officially civil ser- vants, it would be easy to view teachers as simply working in the interests of the state and doing its bidding; certainly the sort of citizen to be raised by means of the Herbart-Ziller style of character-building education would seem to be just the kind of member of society the state would like to have. Yet teachers were also among the most active participants in the associational life of Germany's public sphere. The Lehrervereine (teachers' associations) were emphatically not mere extensions of the state; they were where teachers organized themselves as members of a profession with autonomous interests, which could range from pedagogical novelties to active resistance to normalization and regulation by the state. Teachers thus moved back and forth between their roles as part of the state apparatus and as free advocates of their group professional aspirations and their own individual ideas about teaching. We may speculate that for teachers part of the appeal of the concepts of Gemein- schaft and Lebensgemeinschaft may have lain in their reflection of this very ambigu- ity: teachers, especially those active in reforms, embodied the tension between the interests of the state and those of civil society, and the Gemeinschaft concept made those less contradictory. To take another angle on the same idea, the success of Junge's reform program may have derived in part from its fortuitous balance of lib- eral pedagogy, with every teacher and student learning to be his or her own indepen- dent observer of nature, and the conservative, state-serving ideology that placed the student firmly within a larger whole (or set of wholes). This fit very well with the broader blend of conservative and liberal views shared by many educational reform- ers, who often advocated a structural liberalizing of the schools (such as a common elementary school for all children, greater mobility among different school types, and higher educational and social standing for teachers) in combination with a con- servative social view that laid great stress on subordinating the individual to the good of the society as a whole. Finally, and most broadly, this story suggests how science could be used to main- tain space for the variety of viewpoints deemed desirable in an open civil society. We have seen that Junge's curriculum appealed to an organicist view of society be- cause of the easy analogy between natural Lebensgemeinschaften and human com- munities. But Junge also insisted that his subject-the study of nature-was neutral to politics, standing in principle above and apart from any theoretical and political position. The naturalizing of political positions by claiming such neutrality for sci- ence is well known among historians of science, and one could argue that this is yet another case of the projection of a particular value system onto nature. And yet, I would argue, Junge's position was somewhat subtler than that; he was claiming something more for science, something different. According to Junge, it will be recalled, Lebensgemeinschaften could be used "to justify a materialistic, pantheistic, [or] darwinistic ... world view, but also a deistic one."70 The reason it could be taken in any of those directions, I believe Junge would have argued, was that nature itself was a neutral field: only as it was glossed by humans did it gain meaning. 70 Junge, Dorfteich (cit. n. 17), p. 20. 169</page><page sequence="30">170 LYNN K. NYHART Herein lay the saving grace of natural history. As individuals pursued the scientific truths of natural history, nature itself would provide the neutral common ground upon which proponents of different political, philosophical, and religious views could come together and hash out their differences. From this perspective, the rea- sonable investigation of nature provided a promising field of action for civil society itself and a site for the possibility of civil and social progress.</page></plain_text>
