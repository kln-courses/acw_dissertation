<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Truth and Lie in Nietzsche BY PATRICK J. KEANE Remember Sam Spade trying to get the truth about the Maltese Falcon from Brigid? She pretends to know little or nothing, and the following dialogue ensues. Spade: You are a liar. Brigid: I am. I've always been a liar. Spade (laughing): Well, don't- don't brag about it. Was there any truth at all in that yarn? Brigid: Some. Not very much. . . . Oh, I'm - I'm so tired, so tired of lying and making up lies. Not knowing what is a lie and what's the truth. I wish. . . . This particular impasse is temporarily circumvented - epistemological solution sweet - by the principles pausing to make love, an option unhappily denied Nietzsche. For him the problem of truth and lie persisted, issuing, not in any unqualified solution, but in a compendium of speculations constituting his major legacy to European thought - a confrontation of the consequences attending our revaluation of "truth" which may surpass in philosophic significance the poet-prophet's incantatory doctrines of the Ãœbermensch, Eternal Recurrence, and even the Will to Power. I Nietzsche has a reputation for self-contradiction, and consistency is hardly the main ingredient of his dialectical discussions of truth and lie. If, for example, we turn to the volume of his work most readers of this article are most likely to have at hand - the Viking Portable edited by Walter Kaufmann - we find that it happens to begin and end with commentaries on, and what appear to be antipodal attitudes toward, the quest for truth.

KEANE in search of the true, the beautiful, and the good. "Is it decisive after all," he asks, that we arrive at that view of God, world, and reconciliation which makes us feel most comfortable? Rather, is not the result of his inquiries something wholly indifferent to the true inquirer? Do we after all seek rest, peace, and pleasure in our inquiries? No, only truth - even if it be the most abhorrent and ugly. . . . Faith does not offer the least support for a proof of objective truth. Here the ways of men part: if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire. . . J With this ardent proclamation of a philosophic knight errant, we are in the rarefied company of the most radically authentic, most severe and dedicated spirits - philalethes, friends of truth.2 This is a familiar Nietzsche; certainly there is no dearth of passages in which he burns his candle at the altar of truth and expresses unmitigated contempt for the lie, a word which, in various forms, appears dozens of times in his work. We remember Zarathustra's charge that the poets lie too much, and his attack on "The New Idol," the political state, which "Lies in all the tongues of good and evil."3 But it is in his late diatribe The Antichrist that Nietzsche has most to say of lying. The targets there are the priests, with their life- and reality-negating "holy lie," and the philosophers, with their "lie of the 'moral world order'." The opposition (Nietzsche and kindred free spirits) constitute "nothing less than a 'revaluation of all values,' an incarnate declaration of war and triumph" over the values of theologians, above all, of Christianity, whose church has "turned every value into an un-value, every truth into a lie" {Antichrist 8, 13, 26, 62). Further, the priest is not merely wrong; he lies, for he is "no longer at liberty to lie from 'innocence' or 'ignorance'." Those, Paul especially, who concocted "the lie of the 'resurrected' Jesus," "the great lie of personal immortality," "the lie of the equality of souls," are anything but innocent and ignorant. The Gospels are, in fact, "a first-rate delight for a psychologist- as the opposite of all naive corruption, as subtlety par 1. The Portable Nietzsche, ed. and trans.

Nietzsche is obsessed by what he calls the "holy lie," against which the free spirit must wage its most intense war. Discussed primarily in this work and in the posthumous notes collected as The Will to Power, the holy lie is at the center of what is, for our purposes, the crucial section of The Antichrist - Aphorism 55, in which forms of the word lie are employed no less than fifteen times. Here Nietzsche clarifies his distinction between unintentional - innocent, ignorant - falsity (comprising errors, illusions, linguistic seductions, fantasies, etc.) and deliberate falsification, or genuine lying: By lie I mean: wishing not to see something that one does see; wishing not to see something as one sees it. Whether the lie takes place before witnesses or without witnesses does not matter. The most common lie is that which one lies to oneself; lying to others is, relatively, an exception. According to Nietzsche's definition, the lie - even the lie "to oneself - is not a case of simple self-deception; the genuine liar is fully cognizant of his deception, of others and of himself.4 Of course, the ever- subtle master of lying in a holy manner claims to be merely the mouthpiece of God. Lie? How can he, when to be able to lie, one would have to be capable of deciding what is true - an impossibility when dealing with the highest value problems, problems which transcend the limitations of human reason. "Such a priestly syllogism," says Nietzsche, is by no means merely Jewish and Christian; the right to lie and the 4.

In this last passage we have an ironic distinction between an "honest" and "dishonest" lie. In this Nietzschean variation on the decay of lying we encounter a modern, innocent phenomenon as beneath contempt as it is beyond rectification. The most distinctive feature of modern souls and modern books, sneers Nietzsche, "is not lying, but their inveterate innocence in moralistic mendaciousness .... Our educated people of today, our 'good people,' do not tell lies - that is true; but that is not to their credit! A real lie, a genuine, resolute, 'honest' lie (on whose value one should consult Plato [the reference is presumably to Plato's "noble lie" about Greek racial superiority in The Republic, an "indispensible" lie approved by Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy]) would be something far too severe and potent for them: it would demand of them what one may not demand of them, that they should open their eyes to themselves, that they should know how to distinguish 'true' and 'false' in themselves. All they are capable of is a dishonest lie; whoever today accounts himself a 'good man' is utterly incapable of confronting any matter except with dishonest mendaciousness - a mendaciousness that is abysmal but innocent, true-hearted, blue- eyed and virtuous. These 'good men' - they are one and all moralized to the very depths and ruined and botched to all eternity as far as honesty is concerned . . . ."</page><page sequence="4">70 PATRICK J. KEANE shrewdness of "revelation" belong to the priestly type, to the decadent priests as well as to the priests of paganism. . . . The "law," the "will of God," the "holy book," "inspiration"- all mere words for the conditions under which the priest attains power, with which the priest preserves his power; these concepts are found at the basis of all priestly organizations, of all forms of priestly or philosophic-priestly rule. The "holy lie" - common to Confucius, the law of Manu, Mohammed, the Christian church - is not absent in Plato. "Truth is there": this means, wherever it is announced, the priest lies. (Antichrist 55) The product of the most sophisticated, the "most cold-blooded reflection," the holy lie is elsewhere condemned as the lie in its most harmful, insidious, and subterranean form; the most fundamental lie that has ever been told, for it has "been copied almost everywhere." And, as our aphorism from The Antichrist makes clear, "the origin of the holy lie is the will to power."5 Therefore, whatever else it is, the "piafraus, the heirloom of all philosophers and priests who 'improved' mankind," is potent enough to be worthy of the enmity of a man who prides himself on attacking only what is powerful.6 And we ought not to be deceived by Nietzsche's paradoxical wit. Despite his occasional praise of the deliberate, or "honest," lie- on the grounds, presumably, that a knave is superior to a fool - we must never underestimate his hatred of genuine lying. In our age of scenarios, cover-ups, and inoperative statements, we can take comfort in Nietzsche's attacks on "scene-makers" and "coverings," all involving "the will not to let the truth come out."7 We are left, then, with the lies of holy men, the most fundamental of which is the devaluation of the world in which we live - for "the 'apparent' world is the only one: the 'true' world is merely added by a lie" - and with the truth, Nietzsche's truth - which implies, above all, a fidelity to this world of becoming, and a repudiation of the fictitious Platonic-Christian world of being. 8 But, Nietzsche adds, "my truth is terrible, for so far one has called lies truth." What is called for - now that the world of being has been exposed, now that God is dead - is the Nietzschean revaluation: 5. Ecce Homo, "Why I Am a Destiny," p. 8; The Will to Power, p. 142. 6.

It is my fate that I have to be the first decent human being; that I know myself to stand in opposition to the mendaciousness of millennia. - I was the first to discover the truth by being the first to experience lies as lies - smelling them out. - My genius is in my nostrils. (Ecce Homo "Why I Am a Destiny" 1) Beneath the monomaniacal raging in the wilderness one senses the nobility of a broken spirit. He had asked us earlier to consider how the seeker after knowledge "forces his spirit to recognize things against the inclination of the spirit, and often enough against the wishes of his heart"; and he had written to a friend in 1885, "My life is now comprised in the wish that the truth about all things be different from my way of seeing it; if only someone would convince me of the impossibility of my truths!"9 No one did; his truths remained "terrible," and he paid a terrible price for them. The tragedy of this radically religious spirit which, in devotion to its truths, its "passion for truth in the guise of radical and incessant doubt,"10 denied itself the consolation of religion, seems implicit from at least the time of that letter to his sister quoted earlier. Near the end of his career, in The Antichrist, Nietzsche reaffirms the position taken so many years before. In diametrical opposition to faith, agreeable feelings, convictions, blessedness, the heart's wishes, and all the other false "proofs" of truth, Nietzsche sets "the experience of all severe, of all profoundly inclined spirits." At every step one has to wrestle for truth; one has to surrender for it almost everything to which the heart, to which our love, our trust in life, cling otherwise. That requires greatness of soul; the service of truth is the hardest service. What does it mean, after all, to have integrity in matters of the spirit? That one is severe against one's heart, that one despises "beautiful sentiments," that one makes every Yes and No a matter of conscience. Faith makes blessed: consequently it lies. (Antichrist 50) II Surely this is unequivocal enough. And yet - for in the words of Wallace Stevens, an altogether appropriate poet in this context, "there is always an and yet, and yet" - this is far from the end of the matter.

KEANE is, or at least holds that, in some intelligible sense, the truth can be apprehended. There are cognitivist-noncognitivist problems too knotty to be unravelled in this short paper, u especially since Nietzsche himself never worked out a fully consistent theory of knowledge; but it can hardly be denied that Nietzsche's polemical charges of deliberate falsification and lying are, despite his claims to have moved beyond good and evil, anything but "extra-moral." At the same time, though his familiar image of the philosopher living amid ice and mountain heights implies a transcendent perspective, Nietzsche denied the existence of any objective, external "truth." For him, "Truth' is not something there, that might be found or discovered - but something that must be created"; it is really "another word for the will to power." Even the so- called laws of nature are "regulative fictions," scientific vestigia of mythological dreaming, schematic impositions upon the chaos of the actual. What cannot be escaped is that in a world where "there are no facts," "only interpretations" things exist only for human optics, and "all the laws of perspective must by their nature be errors." "Man's truths" are merely "his irrefutable errors," for all of life is based on "semblance, art, deception, points of view, and the necessity of perspectives and error."12 In addition to this epistemological skepticism, this radical perspectivism, Nietzsche celebrated what he called in the Prefaceto The Gay Science a "second taste," a second dangerous innocence. Repeated a half dozen years later in the Epilogue to Nietzsche contra Wagner ( 1 888), this is the passage, referred to at the outset of these remarks, with which Kaufmann concludes The Portable Nietzsche. It is, stylistically and theoretically, remarkable enough to quote at length. Nietzsche first describes his emergence, out of long exercises in self- mastery, as a different person - one who, no longer trusting life, still loves it; but differently: "the love of a woman who raises doubts in us." "What is strangest," he continues, "is this": afterward one has a different taste - a second taste. Out of such abysses, also out of the abyss of great suspicion, one returns new- born, having shed one's skin, more ticklish and sarcastic, with a more delicate taste for joy, with a more tender tongue for all good things, with gayer senses, with a second dangerous innocence in joy, 11. For a lucid, full-scale examination of the evidence on both sides of this question as to whether Nietzsche was a cognitivist or a noncognitivist, see John T. Wilcox, Truth and Value in Nietzsche: A Study of His Metaphysics and Epistemology, With a Forward by Walter Kaufmann (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1974). 12.

If we who have recovered still need art, it is ... a mocking, light, fleeting, divinely untroubled, divinely artificial art, which, like a pure flame, licks into unclouded skies. Above all, an art for artists, for artists only' We know better afterward what above all is needed for this: cheerfulness .... There are a few things we now know too well, we knowing ones: oh, how we learn now to forget well, and to be good at not knowing, as artists! And as for our future, one will hardly find us again on the paths of those Egyptian youths, who endanger temples by night, embrace statues, and want by all means to unveil, uncover, and put into a bright light whatever is kept concealed for good reasons. No, this bad taste, this will to truth, to "truth at any price," this youthful madness in the love of truth, have lost their charm for us: for that we are too experienced, too serious, too burned, too deep. We no longer believe that truth remains truth when the veils are withdrawn - we have lived enough not to believe this. Today we consider it a matter of decency not to wish to see everything naked . . . One should have more respect for the bashfulness with which nature has hidden behind riddles and iridescent uncertainties. Perhaps truth is a woman who has reasons for not letting us see her reasons? Perhaps her name is- to speak Greek- Baubol [a primitive personification of the female genitals] Oh, those Greeks! They knew how to live. What is required for that is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance. Those Greeks were superficial - out of profundity. And is not this precisely what we are again coming back to, we daredevils of the spirit who have climbed the highest and most dangerous peak of present thought and looked around from up there? Are we not, precisely in this respect, Greeks? Adorers of forms, of tones, of words? And therefore- artists! (Portable, Nietzsche, pp. 681-83) This extraordinarily rich passage, appropriately recalling the distinction made in The Birth of Tragedy between artist and theoretical man and the insistence there that science at its limits "must turn into ar/,"13 seems to embody what Nietzsche elsewhere calls the will to untruth, or to illusion; the necessary acceptance of fictions recognized as such. With the letter to his sister and The Antichrist we are on the grounds of cognitivism and morality; with this Preface to The Gay 13. The Birth of Tragedy 15.</page><page sequence="8">74 PATRICK J. KEANE Science we enter into the ambience of such elegant connoiseurs as Wallace Stevens - with his fictive, and very Nietzschean, notes - and of Oscar Wilde, wittily perturbed about the decay of lying, advocate of "the truth of masks."14 Nietzsche says that the attainment of a "second taste" involves "learning to forget well . . ., to be good at not knowing, as artists." We know what Nietzsche has to say about artists, specifically poets, in Zarathustra: they lie too much. Questioned on this point, Zarathustra replies that if someone said in all seriousness, "the poets lie too much: he would be right; we do lie too much. We also know too little and we are bad learners; so we simply have to lie" (II, 17). So Nietzsche is capable, even though in Ecce Homo he stresses Zarathustra's honesty, of registering his prophet among the poets - by definition liars. Nietzsche's position is clarified in one of the Dionysus Dithyrambs, in which he 1 4. There is no space here to indulge the temptation to engage in a lengthy excursus on the connections between Nietzsche and Stevens, and Nietzsche and Wilde. Suffice it to say that Stevens definitively isolated the "central theme" of his life's work as the possibility of creating "a supreme fiction, recognized as a fiction, in which men could propose to themselves a fulfillment" {Letters, p. 820); and that it is more than coincidental that what he arrives at is a theory of fiction virtually identical to that of Nietzsche - whose work he had read in both German and English. As for Nietzsche and Wilde: their names have been linked by such perceptive commentators as A. R. Orage, Gide, and Mann. Despite the obvious differences between the two men, they would be equally comfortable with Orage's definition of art as "the imaginative perfecting of nature." According to Wilde's "The Decay of Lying," art reveals to us "Nature's lack of design, her curious crudities"; "absolutely indifferent to facts," art "recreates" and refashions "unfinished" reality. Life and nature can never be more than "part of Art's rough materials," materials which to be of real service "must be translated into artistic conventions." Consequently, "as a method Realism is a complete failure"; so-called "modernity" of form and subject-matter is to be avoided. In his own attack on realism, the "backstairs psychology" of modernity in the person of certain contemporary Parisian novelists, Nietzsche declares: "Nature, estimated artistically, is no model. It exaggerates, it distorts, it leaves gaps. Nature is chance. To study 'from nature' seems to me to be a bad sign: it betrays submission, weakness, fatalism; this lying in the dust before petit faits is unworthy of the whole artist." But a few pages later, Nietzsche breaks decisively with the "l'art pour l'ari" gospel of English and French Aestheticism. Art is not self-contained and aimless, he insists. Far from endorsing the Aesthetics' assumption of an absolute distinction between life and art, or Wilde's reduction of life to mere imitation of art, Nietzsche reasserts their vital, purposive relationship: "art" as "the great stimulus to life." {Twilight of the Idols "Skirmishes of an Untimely Man" 7-9, 24) Yet the parallels persist. The underlying theme of Wilde's major critical work, Intentions (1891), is the absolute distinction between the aesthetic and the ethical; in fact, "aesthetics is higher than ethics," and in the rejection of the current notions about morality, it is one with the highest ethics. And the book ends with the "Nietzschean" statement that "the truths of metaphysics are the truths of masks" - a comment with which Yeats, whose doctrine of the mask is virtually a fusion of the ideas of Wilde and Nietzsche, would also agree. For the Wilde passages, see The Artist as Critic: Critical Writings of Oscar Wilde, ed. Richard Ellmann (New York: Random House, Vintage, 1969), esp. pp. xxii, 290, 301, 311, 320, 406-7, 432.</page><page sequence="9">On Truth and Lie in Nietzsche 75 equates poet and fool; adopts for himself the fool's-cap he insists the most serious, the most "burnt," must wear at times; and personally embraces that conscious avoidance of truth required for self- preservation: "Suitor of truth- youT they mocked. "You're only a poet! An animal, a crafty, slinking predator, one that has to lie, that wittingly, willingly has to lie gaily masked Only a fool! Only a poet! so I myself once sank from my truth-madness, from my day-longings, weary of day, made ill by the light- sank down toward evening and shadow, burnt by one truth and thirsty. Do you remember, still remember, fevered heart, how once you thirsted? "May I be banished from all truth!" Only a fool! Only a poet! . . .I5 Whatever ambivalence is inherent in the poetic form, Nietzsche does insist, in what is clearly his own voice, that, as the great stimulant of life, "art is worth more than truth," and, in an aphorism often quoted by W. H. Auden, that "truth is ugly. We possess art so that we shall not perish of truth." 16 The key to Nietzsche's perspective in this instance may lie in Zarathustra's statement that we poets "know too little." Ambiguous here, that admission of ignorance seems to coincide with the skill praised in the Gay Science Preface and in the dithyramb just quoted as not 15. "Only a Fool! Only a Poet!"

The last statement, which is employed by Auden as the epigraph to The Dyer's Hand, is from an unused draft for a preface to a new edition of The Birth of Tragedy. Incidentally, it was a poet, and a romantic poet at that, John Keats, who argued that art is inferior to philosophy "for the same reason that an eagle is not so fine a thing as a truth."</page><page sequence="10">76 PATRICK J. KEANE knowing. For there is in Nietzsche - the noncognitivist and aesthetic Nietzsche - a positive will to ignorance and to illusion. He was, as Karl Schlechts observed in the recent Malahat Review symposium, "the first to recognize the features of the Medusa on the countenance of truth" (Ibid., p. 144). This thrust in Nietzsche's thought, seemingly so at odds with his quest for truth, is evident even in the early, posthumously-published work. The often-quoted remark from an early fragment on Schopenhauer- "the errors of great men are venerable because they are more fruitful than the truths of little men" - sets the tone. But Nietzsche goes further than a reaffirmation of the merely instrumental value of knowledge, and further than a Kantian skepticism - that is, the denial that we can ever have knowledge of things-in-themselves. Science no less than art, he says, is dependent on fictions and deceptive mechanisms, and "even the recognition of their real nature does not destroy their efficacy." "The highest indication of will is the belief in the illusion (although we see through it)." And he declares with double irony: "My philosophy is an inverted Platonism: the further it is from actual reality, the purer, more beautiful and better it becomes. Living in illusion as the ideal."17 The crucial documents of this early period for our purposes are two intimately-related fragmentary essays, kept by Nietzsche in almost total secrecy: "On the Pathos of Truth" (1872) and "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense" (1872).Â« In "On the Pathos of Truth," Nietzsche imagines some "heartless demon" treating such "proud metaphors" as "truth" in a cosmological parable: In some remote corner of the universe, gushing and glittering with innumerable solar systems, there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge. It was the most arrogant, most mendacious moment in "world-history"- but still only a moment. After nature had taken a few breaths of air the star grew cold, and the clever animals had to die. It was about time; for although they boasted of already having great knowledge, they eventually came to recognize, to their extreme vexation, that all their knowledge was false. They died and cursed at the death of truth. . . . Such would be the lot of man if he were an animal capable only of 17. Musarionausgabe, I, 393; IX, 101, 109, 190. 18. The most significant section of the second essay {Musarionausgabe, X, 189-215) has been translated by Kaufmann {Portable Nietzsche, pp. 42-47). "On the Pathos of Truth" was not published until 1921 {Musarionausgabe, IV, 139-47), and did not appear in English until 1972, when it was translated by David S. Thatcher for the Nietzsche Number of The Malahat Review (pp. 134-38).</page><page sequence="11">On Truth and Lie in Nietzsche 11 knowledge. The truth - that is, the truth that he was forever condemned to untruth - would drive him to despair and annihilation. "However," Nietzsche concludes, it suited man to believe only in attainable truth, in ... illusion. Does he not really live through a continual process of delusion? Does not nature conceal most things from him . . .? He is locked up in [his illusory "consciousness"], and nature has thrown away the key. Woe to the calamitous curiosity of the philosopher who demands one look through a chink in the chamberwall of consciousness - then he might sense how man, in the indifference of his own ignorance, is resting on the greedy, the insatiable, the loathsome, the merciless, the murderous, hanging, as it were, dreamingly on the back of a tiger. "Let him remain hanging!" cries art. "Waken him!" cries the philosopher in the pathos of truth. Yet, even as he thinks he is rousing the sleeper, he himself is sinking into an even deeper magical slumber - perhaps he dreams then of ideal "Forms," or of immortality. Art is more powerful than knowledge, for it wills life, and the final goal of knowledge is merely - annihilation. Nowhere is Nietzsche's doctrine - aesthetic illusion as preservative, cognition as radically nihilistic - more forcibly expressed than in that final sentence, written when he was only twenty-eight. The second essay similarly focuses on the arbitrariness and aimlessness of the human intellect in nature, and on our desire, not for truth or pure knowledge, but for "the agreeable life-preserving consequences" of what we designate as "truth." The memorable image of us hanging in a dream upon the back of a tiger and the cosmological parable are repeated virtually verbatim. This- the cosmological, the most icily presbyopic - may be, as one critic has suggested (below, n. 26), the perspective which puts all the others "in perspective." Peering into the great telescope at Palomar the chief astronomer recently whispered to an equally awed interviewer: "This is absolute Reality." Nietzsche would agree at least with the implication that our human "truths" are no more than that: severely limited anthropomorphic exercises in designation. Certainly, when he turns, in "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense," to the question of mind and its relationship to "reality" and "truth," the quotation marks are necessary; for the youthful philologist is not playing the traditional game. There are difficulties and rival theories, but western tradition, with near unanimity, has endorsed the so-called correspondence theory of truth, the definition of truth as the agreement of the mind with reality, of</page><page sequence="12">78 PATRICK J. KEANE thought with thing. Since we will shortly be comparing his position with that of Nietzsche, we might quote Freud. The ordinary man and the scientist alike, says Freud, aim "to arrive at correspondence with reality, that is to say with what exists outside of us and independently of us .... This correspondence with the real external world we call truth." {New Introductory Lectures on Psycho- Analysis, Lecture 35). Now, while Nietzsche will frequently label the conscious deviation from reality to be found in metaphor and myth a "lie," he also argues that not only our language but even our conceptual thinking is based on falsification and simplification. Our words and thoughts alike involve "operations not corresponding to reality," and are therefore, in Nietzsche's rather hyperbolic sense of the word, "lies," (Musarionausgabe, X, 214). But he can also be more "scientific" in his attitude. With Freud as with Nietzsche we must speak of truths rather than the truth; yet the father of psychoanalysis thought the physicist Ernst Mach an "intellectual nihilist" for taking the position that scientific statements reflect merely observations, and do not necessarily describe physical actuality or some truth hidden under appearances. This position, fundamental to the methodology of modern science, was amply anticipated by Nietzsche: "Forgive me as an old philologist who cannot desist from the malice of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation: but 'nature's conformity to law,' of which you physicists talk so proudly as though - why it exists only owing to your interpretation." (Of course, the interpretations serve a purpose, so long as we remember their fictive character. The whole point of scientific theory, in the words of a contemporary writer, "is to account for the evidence with a concise structural metaphor. If this metaphor succeeds in explaining a wide range of observations coherently and economically, it is accepted, even if its 'real' basis, its actual neurophysiology, remains obscure." Even that hierophant of dynamic organicism, Coleridge, could accept the hated "Mechanico-corpuscular Philosophy" within these limits: "as &amp; fiction of science it would be difficult to over-value this invention," but Descartes propounded it "as truth of fact ," and so sacrificed the vital created world to a "lifeless Machine whirled about by the dust of its own Grinding.")19 But to return to the early fragment on Lie and Truth: 19.

In fact, "lying," "posing," "being masked" seem to him so much the rule that he wonders how the will to truth ever appeared among creatures whose eye "glides only over the surface of things and sees 'forms'." (It is worth noting that the surface-quality of the human intellect is hailed by the artistic philosopher who later acquires the delicate second taste of the gay scientist.) To the question of how such a creature came to have an urge to truth Nietzsche claims to have no answer, for our so-called truths are human, all-too-human. To preserve himself not only individually but as a member of society, man invents a fixed designation of things, a "linguistic legislation" which also "furnishes the first laws of truth," for it is here, Nietzsche asserts, that the contrast between truth and lie originates. The obvious questions - Do the designations and the things coincide? Is language the adequate expression of all realities? - can be answered affirmatively only if man conveniently forgets his own role as inventor. "What, then, is truth?" asks the young Nietzsche, repeating, as he so often will, that question of Pilate which he found "the only saying that has valuÃ©" in the New Testament {Antichrist 46). What is truth? It is a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms - in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power .... We still do not know where the urge for truth comes from; for as yet we have only heard of the obligations imposed by society that it should exist: to be truthful means using the customary metaphors - in moral terms: the obligation to lie according to a fixed convention, to lie herdlike in a style obligatory for all . ... Nietzsche is, incipiently at least, a divided man; one whose own mortality colors this ostensibly extra-moral essay. As a moralist he condemns lying, yet lying- that is, imposing falsifying concepts on the variegated world of actuality - seems required in order to live. Other juvenilia and, of course, The Birth of Tragedy - with its delineation of Apollinian illusion, and its famous dictum that the world can be justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon (3, 5, 24) - abound in references to art as the conscious creation of beautiful appearances, and</page><page sequence="14">gO PATRICK J. KEANE to the conscious cultivation of illusion as necessary to art - and to life itself. But Nietzsche remains troubled. In the middle works - Human, Ail-Too- Human and The Dawn - the word "lie" is used with reticence. Nietzsche's mind, moral sense, and pride are evidently offended by what increasingly seems the need to join "the herd," at least to the extent of indulging it in this obligatory inaccuracy. He had written earlier that if conscious falsehood is the condition of life, the question arises "whether death would not be preferable"; but by the time of The Gay Science art has unmistakably come to the rescue, potential nihilism has yielded to the second taste of the newborn man. Consider the exuberant conclusion of Book Two of The Gay Science: Our ultimate gratitude to art. - If we had not welcomed the arts and invented this kind of cult of the untrue, then the realization of the general untruth and mendaciousness that now comes to us through science - the realization that delusion and error are conditions of human knowledge and sensation - would be utterly unbearable. Honesty would lead to nausea and suicide. But now there is a counterforce against our honesty that helps us to avoid such consequences: art as the good will to appearance. We do not always keep our eyes from rounding off something and, as it were, finishing the poem; and then it is no longer eternal imperfection that we carry across the river of becoming - then we have the sense of carrying a goddess, and feel proud and childlike as we perform this service. As an aesthetic phenomenon existence is still bearable for us, and art furnishes us with eyes and hands and above all the good conscience to be able to turn ourselves into such a phenomenon. At times we need a rest from ourselves by looking upon, by looking down upon, ourselves and, from an artistic distance, laughing over ourselves or weeping over ourselves. We must discover the hero no less than the fool in our passion for knowledge; we must occasionally find pleasure in our folly, or we cannot continue to find pleasure in our wisdom. Precisely because we are at bottom grave and serious human beings - really, more weights than human beings - nothing does us as much good as a fool's cap' we need it in relation to ourselves - we need all exuberant, floating, dancing, mocking, childish, and blissful art lest we lose Wit freedom above things that our ideal demands of us. It would mean a relapse for us, with our irritable honesty, to get involved entirely in morality and, for the sake of the over-severe demands that we make on ourselves in these matters, to become</page><page sequence="15">On Truth and Lie in Nietzsche 8 1 virtuous monsters and scarecrows. We should be able also to stand above morality - and not only to stand with the anxious stiffness of a man who is afraid of slipping and falling any moment, but also to float above it and play. How then could we possibly dispense with art - and with the the fool? - And as long as you are in any way ashamed before yourselves, you do not yet belong with us. (107) This is the unfettered Nietzsche; but he remains at bottom serious, and there are passages in the same book which convey a mixture of exhilaration and surrender: equipoise between the traditionalist half longing for the outmoded ideal of absolute truth and the creator of new values saying Yes to untruth - which is also, perspectivally, the only "truth" possible - so long as it allows us to survive. "We need blindness sometimes and must allow certain articles of faith and errors to remain untouched within us - so long as they maintain us in life .... Ah, now we must embrace untruth, now at last error becomes a lie, and lying to ourselves a necessity of life."20 These words - as their ambivalent, deeply personal tone confirms - suggest anything but detached epistemological or aesthetic speculation. What is defined, here and later in The Antichrist, as a lie is, paradoxically, precisely that which must be embraced: an intolerable posture to find oneself in, were it not for the goddess art, and for the consoling thought that our fictions are fruitful, that error "is the mother of knowledge." A similarity and a distinction vis a vis Freud is worth remarking before concluding this section. The following dialogue takes place in one of the verse epigrams preceding The Gay Science: "A: Was I ill? Have I got well?/ Who was my doctor? Can you tell?/ Oh, my memory is rotten!/ B: Only now you're truly well./ Those are well who have forgotten." (Epigram 4) Forgetting here, like our forgetting the true origins of our fictions, sounds like another of Nietzsche's anticipations of the theory of repression;21 but Freud, for who there could ultimately never be an excess of consciousness, would be appalled by Nietzsche's argument that it is forgetting that makes us well again; by his "counterforce against our honesty," his acceptance of the necessity of "lying to ourselves," his gradually developing insistence on the danger of 20.

KEANE "seeing prematurely," of "getting hold of the truth too soon."22 This will to ignorance, the steadily mounting valuation placed on the "surface- nature of our intellect," is quite alien to the full theory of Freudian analysis. For Freud, the patient must at the outset of therapy pledge "absolute honesty;" this is the "fundamental rule of the psychoanalytic technique," he says in his paper "On Beginning the Treatment." Of course, he is aware of inherent danger. In "The Future Prospects of Psycho-Analytic Therapy," he recognizes that some "who take flight into illness" might find the inner conflict exposed by total honesty intolerable and so "succumb or ... cause a mischief greater than their own neurotic illness." But whereas Nietzsche, as noncognitivist, would cast his vote for whatever would be preservative, Freud, exercising what Philip Rieff calls the mind of the moralist, insists that eventually the high price of honesty must be paid; the patient's resistances must be overcome.23 Ill His advocacy of surface-knowledge, his will to ignorance and cultivation of illusion, his skepticism about both the possibility and the value of full consciousness, may be subsumed under what Nietzsche calls the will to untruth. We must now confront what Zarathustra calls the philosophers' "will to truth," and the awkward paradox that it tends to become indistinguishable from its apparent opposite. We saw that Nietzsche found the origin of the holy lie in the will to power. Consistent with his developing monism, he also finds the will to truth a function of the power-drive. Two passages in Part II of Zarathustra make this point, though from somewhat different perspectives. "This," says Zarathustra, "is what the will to truth should mean to you: that everything be changed into what is thinkable for man, visible for man, feelable by man .... And what you have called world, that should be created only by you: your reason, your image, your will .... "(II 2). But if in this passage the revaluer of all values, endorsing interpretation as one primary form of man's imperious affirmation of self, says Yes to the self as creator and to the necessity of 22.

"Will to truth," you who are wisest call that which impels and fills you with lust? A will to the thinkability of all being: this /call your will. You want to make all thinkable, for you doubt with wellfounded suspicion that it is already thinkable. But it shall yield and bend for you. Thus your will wants it. It shall become smooth and serve the spirit as its mirror and reflection. That is your whole will, you who are wisest: a will to power - when you speak of good and evil too, and of valuations. You still want to create the world before which you can kneel: that is your ultimate hope and intoxication. (II 12; cf. Will to Power 517, 520) Walter Kaufmann is so troubled by the implications of this passage that it might be well to think along with him for a moment. Kaufmann fears that "by including truth within the confines of this theory of the will to power, [Nietzsche] has perhaps called in a Trojan horse that threatens his entire philosophy with ruin." This seems an overreaction. Zarathustra, after all, does make distinctions: what the philosophers call their will to truth is really a will to make things comprehensible. But, while Zarathustra's tone is ambiguous here, Kaufmann seems to me correct in suggesting that Nietzsche, for whom "philosophy is this tyrannic urge itself, this most spiritual will to power," is once again opposing such would-be "unriddlers of the universe" as Hegel, in whose view "the initially hidden and precluded essence of the universe has no strength to resist the courage of knowledge."24 One would expect Nietzsche to applaud this implicit attack on the Kantian ding an sich - that "horrendum pudendum of the metaphysicians." But such hubristic claims for the omnipotence of reason seemed to him proof of "Hegel's Gothic heaven-storming" (Musarionausgabe, XVI, 82), proof of that "will to the thinkability of all being" which, under the banner of will to truth, would actually bend and re-mould the world nearer to the heart's, or the mind's, desire. Metaphysics and epistemology are thus discovered to be what Nietzsche calls a mere sign-language for the feelings; they have no more authority than theology, for the "false assertions" of the priest have been opposed by "metaphysical illusions" of the 24.

But if every attempt to unriddle the universe stems from man's will to power, mustn't Nietzsche admit that his attempt, reducing everything to a function of the power-drive, is merely the creation of his own will to power? Is not Nietzsche, as Kaufmann puts it, "in the predicament of Epimenides, the Cretan? If his assertion is correct, it is a fiction." In the course of seeking a solution to a predicament threatening to render Nietzsche's philosophy "self-refuting and absurd," Kaufmann rightly turns to Kant, first synopsizing the Kantian theory of mental faculties, then supplying Nietzsche's response. While phemomenal experience might be a vast fabrication of the human mind, this "fiction" must be considered necessary: it follows iron-clad rules and is not "subjective" in the sense that it would leave the individual any leeway. Our mind, says Kant, is so definitively constituted along the lines developed in his theory of knowledge that synthetic a priori judgments about all human experience ... are possible . . ., Nietzsche . . . felt impelled "to substitute for the Kantian question: 'how are synthetic judgments a priori possible?* another question: 'Why is the belief in such judgments necessary?" And he even questioned that his belief was "necessary" in the sense of being required by the make-up of the human mind; instead he suggested "that for the sake of the survival of beings like ourselves such judgments must be believed to be true, though they might, of course, be false judgments for all that." (Nietzsche, pp. 205-6, quoting Beyond Good and Evil 11) In the aphorism cited here, Nietzsche dissects with irresistable humor the circular reasoning he finds inherent in Kant's epistemology, as well as the post-Kantian search for mental faculties (the occasion for a crucial distinction between finden and erfinden): "The honeymoon of German philosophy arrived. All the young theologians of the Tubingen seminary went into the bushes - all looking for faculties.' And what did they not find- in that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of the German spirit, to which romanticism, the malignant fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between 'finding' and 'inventing' ["finden" und "erfinden"]!" But for more of the same the reader will have to treat himself to Beyond Good and Evil. If he does, he will find that Nietzsche had confronted the matter of necessary fictions, with less wit but rather more drama, a few pages earlier. This passage Nietzsche himself (perhaps anxious about the influence of the neo- Kantian materialist F.A. Lange?) claimed was more than usually revolutionary.</page><page sequence="19">On Truth and Lie in Nietzsche 85 The falseness of a judgment is for us not necessarily an objection to a judgment; in this respect our new language may sound strangest. The question is to what extent it is life-promoting, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-cultivating. And we are fundamentally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments (which include the synthetic judgments a priori) are the most indispensable for us; that without accepting the fictions of logic, without measuring reality against the purely invented world of the unconditional and self-identical, without a constant falsification of the world . . . man could not live - that renouncing false judgments would mean renouncing life and a denial of life. To recognize untruth as a condition of life - that certainly means resisting value feelings in a dangerous way; and a philosophy that risks this would by that token alone place itself beyond good and evil. (4) Belief is necessary, then, not because of the structure of the mind, but for reasons of survival. Acceptance of such false judgments as, say, synthetic judgments a priori, "is necessary as a foreground belief. . . belonging to the perspective optics of life" (Beyond Good and Evil 11). The very word "foreground" implies some final goal; on the other hand, the title of the chapter in which Zarathustra introduces the "will to power" - "On the Thousand and One Goals" - suggests a thoroughgoing perspectivism and moral relativism. It is true that in describing the different moral valuations of different lands and peoples, Nietzsche stresses the common denominator: the will to power. But in these circumstances, in a world in which there is no one veridical interpretation among myriad hypotheses, why should Nietzsche's conception of the morally good or true be any more valid than anyone else's - say, Plato's or, worse, Paul's? What makes the will to power itself, to repeat that question, more than just another fiction masquerading as the finest fruit of the will to truth - especially since the latter seems capable of being subsumed under the former? The only accurate response would seem to be: Nothing. For even Nietzsche can say of his doctrine of the will to power: "Supposing that it also is only interpretation - and you will be eager enough to make this objection? - well, so much the better" (Beyond Good and Evil 22). In the absence of help from Nietzsche, let us attend Zarathustra's exposition. A tablet of the good hangs over every people. Behold, it is the tablet of their overcomings; behold, it is the voice of their will to power. Praiseworthy is whatever seems difficult to a people; whatever</page><page sequence="20">86 PATRICK J. KEANE seems indispensable and difficult is called good; and whatever liberates even out of the deepest need, the rarest, the most difficult- that they call holy.25 The will to power, as Kaufmann (rightly) never tires of telling us, is conceived of by Nietzsche as essentially the will to overcome oneself {SelbstÃ¼berwindung). The praiseworthy, the "morally good," is doing what is difficult for an individual or a nation; that which is easy, comfortable, is not "morally good." So, despite his relativistic insistence that "the beautiful exists just as little as does the good, or the true; in every case it is a question of the conditions of preservation of a certain type of man" ( Will to Power 804), Nietzsche does establish a criterion - creative, strenuous self-overcoming - according to which he can make distinctions between, and even grade, interpretations and tables of moral valuation. In fact, toward the end of his career, he specifically prescribed as the "future task of the philosopher": "the determination of the order of rank among values" (On the Genealogy of Morals I, 17). This is not quite the same as to say that, in dealing with Nietzsche on truth, one may grant his perspectivism and yet talk about the truth of one perspective as compared to another - unless by that one means the cosmological perspective mentioned earlier, the perspective which, enabling man to go beyond or above himself, subsumes all anthropomorphisms in the understanding that truths are never metaphysical or "transcendent" in the traditional sense, but 25. Thus Spoke Zarathustra I, 15. As Yeat's phrase, "the fascination of what's difficult," suggests, Nietzsche's consistent emphasis on what is difficult and his principle of self- overcoming have both ethical and aesthetic applications. Because it so concisely fuses truth, lie, and the solitary overcoming of what Zarathustra calls "the most difficult," Yeats's "To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing," a poem unmistakably related to his reading of Nietzsche, is apropos enough to be quoted in full: Now all the truth is out, Be secret and take defeat From any brazen throat, For how can you compete, Being honour bred, with one Who, were it proved he lies, Were neither shamed in his own Nor in his neighbours' eyes? Bred to a harder thing Than Triumph, turn away And like a laughing string Whereon mad fingers play Amid a place of stone, Be secret and exult, Because of all things known That is most difficult.</page><page sequence="21">On Truth and Lie in Nietzsche 87 perspectivai, and, as such, manifest a purely "human Will to Power."26 But generally, in distinguishing between various ideas and, especially, values, Nietzsche is ultimately not involved with their "truth" - if by that we mean the correspondence between our ideas and "reality" - but with whether we ought to believe them, and why; that is, with their value for life - even if they should be false ideas, errors, lies. This hardly squares with the cognitivist side of Nietzsche, and with the judgments we have seen him making in The Antichrist, with its obsessive repetition of the outraged charge: lie! But the deepest implication ofthat charge, beyond the church's willful revaluation of ancient, and noble, values, is Christianity's perversion of reality itself. Like all idealist moralities, it is utterly alien, antipodal, to life, actuality, nature. Of course, this presupposes a knowable something (in this case, "life") which is then invested with absolute, unconditional value: a position which Nietzsche himself, "cosmological perspective" notwithstanding, refutes time and again, and for which his philosophy can provide, even when he himself is in need, no support whatever.27 But his point, it seems 26. For an elaboration of this argument, see Richard Lowell Hovvey, Heidegger and Jaspers On Nietzsche: A Critical Examination of Heidegger's and Jasper's Interpretations of Nietzsche (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1973). Howey, in his chapter on "Nietzsche's Metaphysics and Epistemology," stresses the "fundamental" nature of this cosmological perspective: ". . . . even though Nietzsche rejects all the traditional forms of transcendence, there is for him, nonetheless, a TRANSCENDENT perspective, namely, the cosmological perspective, which is THOUGHT about REALITY. This TRANSCENDENCE is rooted in the possibility of our Being, as human, to move 'beyond' the context of knowledge and to grasp it as life-preserving fictions TRUTH, then, for Nietzsche is the understanding that all truths are perspectivai and, as such, are manifestations of the human Will to Power." Howey argues that Nietzsche's whole philosophy depends on this paradoxical transcendence within immanence. ". . . . through the dialectic of philosophy man has the possibility of taking up a perspective which TRANSCENDS life and which, thereby, places him in the position of being able to TRANSvalue." Nietzsche's metaphysics requires "the possibility of taking up a cosmological perspective, for without this TRANSCENDENCE no 'evaluation' of life would be possible and, therefore, no Transvaluation as an attempt to overcome nihilism would be possible." (pp. 69, 72, 74; and see below, n. 27) 27. This dilemma has been noted and briefly discussed by Jaspers in his book on Nietzsche. Nietzsche's attack on morality, says Jaspers, "presupposes that it is possible to know what reality is," and to be able to deal with it as "a given." But still, "throughout the whole of Nietzsche's philosophy, all reality is itself only interpretation- 3. kind of exegetical construction beyond whose limitless variations nothing else exists. I have only one kind of consciousness of reality; I do not know reality as an independent existent outside of myself." Howey (above, n. 26) is convincing in arguing that by placing himself "in a perspective 'beyond' and 'outside' of himself," man "encounters the limitations of all his other perspectives as an anthropos which lives and thinks in the context of a world" (p. 81); but this cosmological perspective, which "stands opposed to and threatens" the utilitarian perspectives of life, (p. 84) still seems incapable of revealing independent reality. And as for evaluating life, Nietzsche himself writes "Judgments, judgments of value, concerning life, for it or against it, can, in the end, never be true: they have value only as [physiological] symptoms The value of life cannot be estimated" {Twilight of the Idols, "The Problem of Socrates" 2).</page><page sequence="22">88 PATRICK J. KEANE clear, is that the Platonic-Christian-Kantian-democratic "moral world order" is static, an immense stone in the path of the dynamic, self- overcoming drive toward "something higher, farther, more manifold." And since this drive, the will to power, is the secret "life itself* confided to Nietzsche as Zarathustra, it must take empirical precedence over that which, in the hypocritical name of "humanitarian blessings," would impede and negate life (Zarathustra II, 12; Antichrist 62). The point may be clarified by citing a perceptive distinction between "moral revolution" and "morality in stasis" recently made in, of all things, an application of Nietzschean insights to the women's revolution of the nineteenth century: Seen in a Nietzschean light, moral revolution contains what is essential to morality in a way that morality in stasis does not. In focusing on morality in stasis, and especially on morality as it concerns justification and principle, the traditional philosopher is "human, all too human." He offers the rationalization that is necessary to the herd, the rationalization which operates against creation and change.28 Which operation, it should be added, constitutes what Nietzsche might call the sin against the unholy spirit: the "un-moral" power-drive at the vital heart of "un-moral" reality. Ultimately, it would seem then, the radical distinction between the holy lie - at least in its most subterranean form, the Christian, identified as the will to lie at any price - and the philosophic will to truth - revealed now by our master vivisectionist as mere invention, interpretation, imposition, fiction - is that while the first is utterly life- denying, life-destroying, the second, in some instances at least, includes judgments belief in which is life-preserving, life-promoting. Even The Antichrist, in the Preface to which Nietzsche declares, "one must never ask if the truth is useful or if it may prove our undoing," supports this seeming pragmatism: Ultimately, it is a matter of the end to which one lies. That "holy" ends are lacking in Christianity is my objection to its means. Only bad ends: poisoning, slander, negation of life, contempt for the body, the degradation and self-violation of man through the concept of sin - consequently its means too are bad .... Indeed, it makes a difference to what end one lies: whether one preserves or destroys. One may posit a perfect equation between Christian and 28.

Belief in their truth - placed in quotation marks because this is precisely what Nietzsche means by "recognizing untruth as a condition of life" - is necessary, but only as a perspectivai "foreground belief." And since ever-changing life is "that which must always overcome itself'' these foreground beliefs, even those cherished by Nietzsche himself (for each man kills the thing he loves), are always prolegomena to the new perspectives of future value-creators. "Whatever I create and however much I love it," says Zarathustra- soon I must oppose it and my love; thus my will wills it. And you too, lover of knowledge, are only a path and footprint of my will; verily my will to power walks also on the heels of your will to truth .... And whoever must be a creator in good and evil must first be an annihilator and break values ... but this is creative And may everything be broken that cannot brook our truths! There are yet many house to be built! (II, 12) "But this is creative": all-important, for "Truth" is not something to be discovered, but "something that must be created." And therefore not "the truth"- that does not exist- but "our truths." Destruction: but only as the prerequisite to creative rebuilding; for all things fall and are built again, and those that build them again are gay - scientists.29 IV The rebuilders are fabricators, artists. And if it is to Nietzsche's vision of the artist that we find ourselves recurring, the key texts remain those already quoted at length from The Gay Science. The infectious effervescence, the irresistable vitality, the sprezzatura of the Preface and aphorism 107 recall Shakespeare's Ariel (or, since we are beyond good and evil, Ben Jonson's nimble Mosca) - or the spontaneous joy of a Blakean child. But with a significant difference. What characterizes this Nietzsche of the "second taste" is the recaptured "innocence of becoming" {Unschuld des Werdens), Blake's "organized innocence," or what Hart Crane calls "an improved infancy." There may be no more 29.

KEANE fundamental archetype in western theology, philosophy, and literature than that of the circuitous journey from unity (the ignorance which is bliss), through painful separation (marked by the dawning of consciousness, which eventually takes the demonic form of self- consciousness), to a restored unity on a higher level: a complex unity incorporating and converting the absorbed knowledge from something merely intellectual to what the Romantics like to call unity of being, the thinking of the body, or, to use Blake's phrase again, organized innocence. This idea of ricorso, of a return, via knowledge (for, as Hegel says, "the hand that inflicts the wound is also the hand that heals it"), to a second naivete or "second taste," takes its Nietzschean form in the gaya scienza of the passages referred to, and in the first of Zarathustra's discourses, "On the Three Metamorphoses of the Spirit." The spirit evolves, we are told in that parable, from submissive camel through defiant lion to the genuine creator of new values; the third and final phase of the process of SelbstÃ¼berwindung', the child. Yeats, who always closely linked Blake and Nietzsche, points us directly to this passage when, after noting Blake's preference for "a happy thoughtless person" to "any man of intellect," and his "praise of life - 'all that lives is holy'," he immediately adds of this preference: "Nietzsche had it doubtless at the moment when he imagined the 'Superman' as a child." And he concludes: "We artists suffer in our art if we do not love most of all life at peace with itself and doing without forethought what its humanity bids it and therefore happily."30 We are used to Yeats' celebration of those "great ignorant leafy ways" of pre-lapsarian innocence; but paradise is locked, and you can't go home again. The Romantics - with their renewed respect for the powers of the unconscious and their suspicion of the analytic intellect which murders to dissect - were among the first to question the ideal of augmented consciousness, of absolute lucidity. But even they, for the most part, found the remedy to the problem, not in primitivistic regression, but in knowledge itself - though, in Wordsworth's influential phrase, "Knowledge not purchased by the loss of power." Nietzsche may warn against too much consciousness, advocate preservative fictions, and praise the ability to "forget well, and to be good at not knowing, as artists"; but he admits that such a "rest from ourselves" comes only "at times," that, at bottom, we are necessarily 30.

(I am reminded of Coleridge's famous remark about "that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith," and of the recent gloss by an eminent Coleridgean: "One can only deplore the habit of quoting the first five words in isolation, thereby substituting some sort of gratuitous make-believe or day- dreaming for a complex act of faith ....") Seen in this way, Hart Crane's "improved infancy" is no less problematic than Wordsworth's claim of "abundant recompense" for what has been lost; it is at precisely the critical moment of his epic poem The Bridge that Crane must petition his mythopoeic Indian spirit to "relent, restore - /Lie to us - dance us back the tribal morn." Like Wallace Stevens, Crane must embrace his own supreme fiction, fully cognizant that it is a fiction, a "lie." "In the long run the truth does not matter," writes Stevens. "The final belief is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. The exquisite thing is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe in it willingly." The same sophistication informs the theory of fiction of his precursor Nietzsche, for whom "the highest indication of the will is the belief in the illusion (although we see through it)." Consequently, Nietzsche wills ignorance and is "superficial," like those Greeks, "out of profundity." Are we not, he asks rhetorically, "precisely in this respect Greeks?

Let nobody doubt that whoever [and he refers specifically to "both philosophers and artists"] stands that much in need of the cult of surfaces must at some time have reached beneath them with disastrous results. Perhaps there even exists an order of rank among these burnt children, these born artists who can find the enjoyment of life only in the intention of falsifying its image.... The degree to which life has been spoiled for them might be inferred from the degree to which they wish to see its image falsified, thinned down, transcendentalized, deified - the nomines religiosi might be included among artists, as their highest rank....

KEANE God," seen in this way, would appear as the subtlest and final offspring of the fear of truth, as an artist's worship and intoxication before the most consistent of all falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth, as an artist's worship and intoxication before the most consistent of all falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at any price... .[Piety] can turn man into so much art, surface, play of colors, graciousness that his sight no longer makes one suffer. (59) Reading such a passage we begin to understand Nietzsche's ambivalence about these "burnt children," these artists. He had used the same image in his dithyramb "Only a fool! Only a poet/" and in the Gay Science Preface, but there it was "I myself and "we" who were "too burned, too deep" to be charmed by the archaic will to truth. Conversely, the justification of the conscious will to illusion, to untruth - that it is life-preserving - while it convinces the aesthetic Nietzsche, does not spike the guns of the self-professed crusading immoralist: "the decadents need the lie - it is one of the conditions of their preservation." We can even find Nietzsche confronting the problem of what one really knows from different perspectives within a single sub-chapter. "Even the most courageous among us only rarely has the courage for that which he really knows," he writes in Twilight of the Idols', and moments later: "I want, once and for all, not to know many things. Wisdom sets limits to knowledge too."32 We cannot conclude with a conclusion; and that is not an evasion but a necessity - if we would be truthful. How could it be otherwise in dealing with a man for whom all concepts are merely foreground estimates, provisional perspectives? In keeping with his perspectivism, Nietzsche describes "the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue" as the foundation of the will to knowledge - error as the mother of knowledge- and he sees the will to knowledge, in relation to the will to untruth, "not as its opposite, but - as its refinement!" (Beyond Good and Evil 2, 24). Simplification and falsification of the world - the erection of invented mundos over against the universal flux - is, then, the paradoxical prerequisite to knowledge, and, as such, Nietzsche will not necessarily object to it. The language-maker, for example, "was not modest enough" to realize that he had not apprehended the real world, but "had only given designations to things." But while this was an "immense error," it is happily irreversible, for "the development of 32. Ecce Homo, Section on The Birth of Tragedy 2; Twilight of the Idols "Maxims and Arrows" 2, 5.</page><page sequence="27">On Truth and Lie in Nietzsche 93 reason . . . rests upon this error," and thus "error has turned animals into men."33 Because language, still awkward, "will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many subtleties of gradation" (Beyond Good and Evil 24), Nietzsche seems mired in self-contradiction in these discussions of the will to truth and the will to untruth. From one perspective, the noncognitivist, the latter is accepted as life-preserving and as a stepping stone to later knowledge. And yet, the major western philosophic and religious "falsifications" - Platonic, Christian, Kantian idealism - are the "lies," the genuine lies, against which Nietzsche launches some of his subtlest and also some of his most hysterical attacks - though especially, it should be noted, in The Antichrist and Ecce Homo, both of which were written in 1 888 but published only after Nietzsche had become insane. (The point is worth making since Nietzsche might in time have stressed the point, already implicit in passages such as that with which this paper concludes, that even Christianity was a culturally useful error, or lie.) And yet another "and yet"; the "reality" these "lies" pervert is itself not something out there to be discovered, but something that must be humanly created - a hypothesis, perspective, interpretation. This is a dizzying triad; but perhaps its seeming contradictions are degrees and subtleties of gradation, perspectives hammered into the unity of Nietzsche's fundamental monistic conception: "that the value of the world lies in our interpretation . . .; that previous interpretations have been perspective valuations by virtue of which we can survive in life, i.e., in the will to power for the growth of power" (Will to Power 616). And, finally, the apostle of the "un-moral" will to power can yet speak of his vestigial "piety." Perhaps his attitudinal complexities are best synopsized in another and final document from The Gay Science, this from Book Five, added to the second edition in 1 887. Nietzsche opens an aphorism entitled "How far we too are pious," with his usual dismissal of convictions (which he thought more dangerous than lies as enemies of truth), unless they descend to the modesty of a hypothesis, a provisional point of view, a regulative fiction. But if convictions are thus reduced, whence science's unconditional will to truth? - especially since "the inutility and dangerousness of the 'will to truth,' of 'truth at any price,' are proved to it continually ... ?" Consequently, "will to truth" does not mean "I will not let myself be deceived" but - there is no choice - "I will not deceive, not even myself: and with this we are on the ground of morality. For one 33. Human, Ail-Too- Human, 11, 519.</page><page sequence="28">94 PATRICK J. KEANE should ask oneself carefully: "Why don't you want to deceive?" especially if it should appear - and it certainly does appear - that life depends on appearance; I mean, on error, simulation, deception, self-deception; and when life has, as a matter of fact, always shown itself to be on the side of the most unscrupulous polytropoi. Charitably interpreted, such a resolve might perhaps be a quixotism, a minor slightly mad enthusiasm; but it might also be something more serious, namely, a principle that is hostile to life and destructive.- "Will to truth"- that might be a concealed will to death. Thus the question "Why science?" leads back to the moral problem: Why have morality at all when life, nature, and history are "not moral"? No doubt, those who are truthful in that audacious and ultimate sense that is presupposed by the faith in science thus affirm another worWthan the world of life, nature, and history; and insofar as they affirm this "other world" - look, must they not by the same token negate its counterpart, this world, our world? - But you will have gathered what I am driving at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical fait h upon which our faith in science rests - that even we seekers after knowledge today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take our fire, too, from the flame lit by a faith that is thousands of years old, that Christian faith which was also the faith of Plato, that God is the truth, that truth is divine. - But what if this should become more and more incredible, if nothing should prove to be divine any more unless it were error, blindness, the lie - if God himself should prove to be our most enduring lie? - (344) Without attempting to follow every twist and turn of the argument here, we may still take note of an ultimate irony involved in Nietzsche's position on truth and lie. If life frequently depends on polytropoi - Odyssean wiliness and craft in deceiving oneself and others - then the unconditional will to truth is hostile to life, dangerous to our own survival. To the extent, therefore, that we willingly sacrifice ourselves on the altar of truth, "we too are pious." Contemplating the personal tragedy of Nietzsche's life, one is indeed tempted to envision him as still "pious" - committed, not to the fictions, the lies, that might have preserved him, but to the truths that may have contributed to his destruction: truths he himself believed were "terrible," and of whose impossibility he wished in vain "someone would convince me."34 34. See above, p. 4. Nietzsche himself wrote: "1 dream of a combination of men who shall make no concessions, who shall show no consideration, and who shall be willing to be called 'destroyers': they apply the standard of their criticism to everything and sacrifice themselves to truth."</page></plain_text>
