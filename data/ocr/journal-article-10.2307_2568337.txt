The name Gideon Lincecum remains some- thing of a legend in and around Austin, Texas. Although virtually unknown to scientists or historians of science today, Lincecum (1793- 1874) devoted a lifetime to describing the flora and fauna of central and southeastern Texas. Uneducated and isolated from almost</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 1611 all other naturalists and scientific institutions, Lincecum nonetheless delighted in studying and recording his observations on virtually anything and everything in the natural world. This book, which includes extended excerpts from Lincecum's correspondence with such notable figures as Charles Darwin, Joseph Leidy, and Spencer Fullerton Baird, testifies to his wide-ranging interests. The editors quote at length from Lincecum's observations and letters on birds, plants, and the geology of Texas. Particularly noteworthy were his ac- counts of ants, and the editors explore the controversy of the "Lincecum myth": the au- thor's claim that agricultural ants intentionally planted and harvested grain in and around their mounds. While this book offers ample evidence of Lincecum's curiosity and his frequent, albeit controversial, role as a contributor to science, the editors do not effectively situate and exam- ine Lincecum within the context of nineteenth- century natural history. The difficulties that Lincecum experienced as a frontier naturalist were by no means unique; by concentrating almost exclusively on this one individual, however, the editors fail to delineate the com- mon as well as uncommon features of his work. Lincecum's wide-ranging interests were characteristic of naturalists of the time, as were attempts by well-established figures to take advantage and control of others' observa- tions and collections. The editors emphasize Lincecum's lack of education to explain the skepticism with which his work was received, but many members of the Academy of Natu- ral Sciences of Philadelphia and other scien- tific organizations had no college or university training. Equally important in explaining their reac- tions is another feature of Lincecum's work, which the authors mention only in passing: his anthropomorphism. Lincecum's observa- tions were filled with references to animal in- telligence, planning, and courage. As indi- cated by Darwin's comments, most naturalists had abandoned such language by the mid- nineteenth century. The fact that Lincecum had not requires further exploration and anal- ysis. The lack of attention to historical context also results in some questionable statements. Erasmus Darwin, although a well-known fig- ure, was not the most knowledgeable investi- gator of his age, and certainly not by the time Lincecum was reading his works in the 1 830s. Lincecum was not alone in experimenting with native grasses, and others had previously studied and published on insect behavior. The author may not have known of such work, but that does not excuse the editors from failing to provide a more historically accurate and so- phisticated context for discussing Lincecum. The focus on his letters and activities will in- terest Lincecum's admirers, but the lack of a meaningful framework for more fully explor- ing and making sense of his work will disap- point historians.
