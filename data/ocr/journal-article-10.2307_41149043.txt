ISBN 978-1-890951-78-8 Reviewed by: Martha Poon University of California, San Diego DOI: 10.1177/0162243910362964 Perhaps the most dramatic change of all in this long history of knowers and knowing was the emergence of objectivity: a novelty so blinding as to become invisible, it came to be perceived as an inevitability rather than as an innovation (p. 376). An atlas is a catalog that preserves scientific images. It is a visual repository of the rare or ephemeral that serves to calibrate the eyes of scientists by teaching them "what to see and how to see it" (p. 44). In this book, histor- ians of science Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison have executed an impres- sive survey of the long tradition of atlas making - from eighteenth century engravings of flora, through late nineteenth century images of snowflakes, all the way to mid-twentieth century compendia of solar magnetograms - and have unearthed the material techniques and practices for producing the standardizing illustrations ornature worthy of being fixed within the pages of these working manuals. The result is a serious expansion of a landmark article published well over a decade ago (Daston and Galison 1992). The book itself constitutes a kind of atlas that documents the "epistemol- ogies of the eye" guiding scientific picture makers. The illustration-rich volume comes complete with an insert of color plates, a generous selection of pictures excised from their original sources and redeployed as exem- plars of the particular epistemological qualities that scientific images can</page><page sequence="2">132 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values 36(1) have. Once on display within the pages of Daston and Galison's atlas, Audubon's fetching picture of a pair of titmice - engraved, hand-colored, posed, tufted, and peering attentively at one another through pine cone lined branches - assumes a further illustrative purpose: it demonstrates the use of "mannered compositions" and "anthropomorphic stances" in nineteenth century depictions of wildlife. The historians' claim is that "objectivity" as the absolute approach to seeing nature - that is, as a creed permeating "every aspect of science, from philosophical reflections on metaphysics and method to everyday techniques for making observations and images" (p. 195) - is of recent innovation. Moreover, they seek to show that its emergence was neither incremental nor a sudden explosion but rather that it arrived like an avalanche, triggered by a series of contingent circumstances. Objectivity, the enticing one-word title of the book does, certainly, take center stage. However, it is important to note that the stated purpose of the research is actually a significantly more ambi- tious undertaking. The full-blown project is to detail the "existence, emer- gence, and interaction of epistemic virtues in science" (p. 48). Thus, the main matter of the text is the thick description of a handful of distinct codes for seeing scientifically, among which objectivity is but one kind of sight. Epistemic Virtues in Practice The nature of epistemic virtues turns out to be surprisingly abstract. As the authors explain, "Some significant historical phenomena are invisible at the local level, even if their manifestations must by definition be located some- where, sometime" (p. 48). Epistemic virtues "will inevitably be inflected by local context, but without losing their identity." So, as Daston and Galison conceive of them, "The existence, emergence and iteration of epis- temic virtues in science are phenomena on this larger scale" (p. 48). The exciting finding for science studies is that while scientific figures may all aspire "to reveal a reality accessible only with difficulty" (p. 58), the mea- sures they have taken to accomplish this task are themselves "historical par- ticulars" - specific sets of epistemic demands, which undergo perpetual transformations as the content of what threatens truth, changes. The first epistemic virtue discussed, named "truth-to-nature," emerged in the early eighteenth century. Born out of an anxiety over monstrosities and untamed variations, it required that naturalists push beyond experience toward synthetic examples of "the typical" (basic types from which indi- viduals were derived) or "the ideal" (universais embodied in single exam- ples). "Failure to discriminate between essential and accidental detail;</page><page sequence="3">Book Review 133 failure to amend a flawed or atypical specimen" (p. 1 86) was considered the error of the incompetent or the neophyte. The truth of nature was also aesthetically pleasing. So, an atlas maker such as Albinus not only painstak- ingly posed his anatomical specimens but he would have background orna- ments added in "to enhance the beauty of the plates" (p. 72). Mid-nineteenth century "mechanical objectivity" did not emerge determi- nistically from the invention of image making tools. Daston and Galison doc- ument photography's original employment in the service of truth-to-nature as well as the controversies surrounding its early use. They argue that mechan- ical objectivity gathered force only after the "epistemological enemy" was re-situated. If machines could offer a solution to the problem of truth, this was only once "it was no longer variable nature or the wayward artist but the scientific self that posed the greatest perceived epistemological danger" (p. 198). Within the third epistemic virtue, "trained judgement," arising in the twentieth century, the judgment of the scientist once again came into play. It was re-invoked as a supplement to "mere objectivity." As the authors point out, "The exercise of a highly trained judgement after objectivity - in response to its perceived shortcomings - is quite a different matter from drawing to unearth an ideal in the years before protocol-driven mechanical objectivity reared its head" (p. 347). That the main plotline of the book can be so swiftly summarized is a testa- ment to its thoughtful construction. The work condenses a dizzying number of cases from across an astounding array of scientific fields. At the same time, the text clearly strives to satisfy a broader social scientific audience through the frequent insertion of crisp, punctuated statements that summarize the more general description of epistemic virtues as they are drawn out of the col- lated histories. We are repeatedly reminded that although originating in dif- ferent periods of history, epistemic virtues do not replace one another. They accumulate over time, each new one modifying the others, yet retaining its specificity as they interrelate. The value of the book arguably hinges on the usefulness of these "epistemic virtues" as contributions to science studies' core conceptual equipment for the study of science. If, after all, "The very existence of atlases testifies to ambitions beyond the here and now" (p. 202), then it is perhaps worth examining these concepts in greater detail. Epistemic Virtue as a Practice of the Self The book pivots around a central chapter in which the authors explore the ways in which "The mastery of scientific practices is inevitably linked to self-mastery, the assiduous cultivation of a certain kind of self (p. 40).</page><page sequence="4">134 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values 36(1) Since "the pursuit of knowledge is also a way of life, to be exemplified and thereby typified," Daston and Galison turn their attention toward the prac- tices of scientific selves "as historically specific stereotypes and moral les- sons" (p. 232). The self of the enlightenment "was a largely passive and permeable self, shaped by its environment" (p. 201), while in contrast, the integrated post-Kantian self "was viewed as overactive and prone to impose its preconceptions and pet hypotheses on data" (p. 203). The effect of these selves is reflected in practices. A scientist of the former was bound to "extract truth-to-nature from numerous impressions, as the smelter extracts pure metal from ore;" one of the latter was driven toward "self-discipline, self-restraint, self-abnegation, self-annihilation, and a multitude of other techniques of self-imposed selflessness" (p. 203). There is a concerted attempt here to elevate the umbrella term "episte- mic virtue" (singular) to a separate and supra-existence over the specific exemplars (plural) worked up in other chapters. As the authors conceive of it, an epistemic virtue is an internalized ethical imperative. The terms "norm" (p. 40) and "regulative ideal" (p. 233) are additionally used. Instead of overturning the objectivity/subjectivity split at the root of episte- mological issues and dissolving one hopelessly into the other, the book takes their mutual configuration as an analytic resource. It is noteworthy, however, that to treat these configurations as carried within the scientific person, the authors make a noticeable shift away from acts of image making (praxis). To shift up to a greater degree of generality, a broader set of activ- ities associated with scientific lifestyle (such as journal keeping), yet not directly related to image production are absorbed into the discussion. Shared norms or values are a hardy social scientific solution to the prob- lem of collective action. They are appealing because they can be used to explain how individuals distributed in many places can be guided toward similar epistemological projects while subtly obviating the need to account for their own transmission. Unfortunately, they may be too quick a solution to these authors' complex undertaking. Part of the trouble is reflected in the ambiguous employment of the term "collective empiricism" to describe many levels of coordination in science. Early on, the term is used to make assurances that a single atlas results from "the collaboration of investiga- tors over time and space"f(p. 26). Yet, in the last chapter, it is used to indi- cate that the ups and downs of scientific sights "constitute the development of a truly collective empiricism," that is to say, that no single group of atlas making practitioners (crystallographers, anatomists, and astrophysicists) "can take credit for developing the regulative ideal of mechanical objectiv- ity" (p. 368, emphasis in original).</page><page sequence="5">book Review 1 35 Situating epistemic virtue so squarely within the person and in lifestyle conflicts with the granularity of the surrounding empirical presentation. Not of least concern is that the emphasis on an internalized scientific self risks sliding science studies back into a framework that privileges the authority of the virtue laden scientist convening with nature through the exercise of personal principles, a figure that dominated the historical record before the advent of science studies. Yet, as so much research has shown, once this mythical archetype is dissolved through an attentiveness to distributed knowledge production, science inevitably involves the coordination of a number of (ethically, socially, and technically) differentiated selves, even if these negotiations are later effaced from the scientific record.1 The delicate description of "four-eyed sight" - of the conflictual relationships of work and attribution that existed between eighteenth century naturalists, illustrators, (female) artists, and engravers (chap. 2, p. 84) - elegantly confirms this position. Conclusion: The Virtues of Seeing Specific Epistemes The strength of the atlas as a working document comes from its ability to shape interpretation by transporting a way of seeing between local sites. Through consultation or circulation, atlases are shared working tools for investigators dispersed over continents, disciplines, and generations. An important solution within the sciences to the "need for common objects of inquiry" (p. 22), this third mechanism of creating collective empiricism is, perhaps, the one that most closely resembles what Daston and Galison are themselves achieving through the publication of this book. Their beau- tiful depictions of truth-to-nature, mechanical objectivity, and trained judg- ment, meticulously drawn out of the actual practices of historical atlas making, provide a tremendous potential resource for coordinating how the sciences are seen from within the social studies of science. The substance of this work does a masterful job of demonstrating how to explore the specific techniques, practices, and distributed working arrange- ments that express, embody, and put into conflict the three main epistemic forms.2 However, its immediate relevance lies, perhaps, in an even more specific point, that is, in its clear articulation of how scientific practices are guided by a limited number of distinct epistemological forms whose coher- ence must be maintained if science is to have a character that can endure. The authors themselves put it this way: far from relativising these virtues "a history of epistemic virtues [ . . . ] exhibits their rationale, if not their transcendent rationality" (p. 376). At a moment when interpretations of</page><page sequence="6">136 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values 36(1) science inspired by science studies are being accused of having aided and abetted the politicized treatment of science within the former U.S. admin- istration, this message could not have arrived at a more welcome time. Das- ton and Galison more than adequately show that pluralizing the sciences does not mean that anything goes. Notes 1 . For an important discussion of how the objective scientific work performed by one group can be devalued and made invisible when science is identified with the idealized virtues of another see, for example, Oreskes (1996). 2. The fourth and fifth chapters are exceptions to this. Chapter Five, omitted from the current discussion for reasons of space, traces out a fourth epistemological virtue: 'structural objectivity'. Based on structures rather than images, structural objectivity is developed out of mathematical and philosophical writings unre- lated to atlas making and does not appear have an analogue in actual practice. The conclusion (Ch. 7) drifts away from the core of the book into discussion over how the nature of scientific visualization might be changing with nano-imagery. Similar arguments about the generative potential of visualization in science have been previously made, for example, by (Cambrosio &amp; Keating, 1992). References Cambrosio, A., and P. Keating.
