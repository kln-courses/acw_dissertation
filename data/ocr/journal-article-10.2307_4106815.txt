<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY M. A. Stewart and Rosamond Kent Sprague I--M. A. Stewart At Phaedo 9ob Plato admitted a distinction between good and bad argument, cautioning against the scepticism which may be induced by professionals who practise the rebuttal of every argument. But even those who admire the subtlety of the arguments in Phd. must find it difficult to see what is good about them. At 91a the distinction seems to lie in the inten- tions (whether truth, or victory) of the arguer, leaving no room for a bad argument with good intentions, or a good argument with bad intentions. But just previously, truth is considered the property of arguments themselves, and it is unlikely that Plato was absolutely clear about the correct point at which to raise questions of truth and falsity. He did have some conception of argument as a means of attaining a conclusion. Thus there are plenty of suggestions in the dialogues that the speakers have got where they have be- cause the argument has brought them there. If they do not like the destination there are two standard ploys: one is to nullify the thesis from which they started; the other is to dissociate themselves from the conclusion either by expostula- tion or by the help of a rival argument going in the opposite direction. But Plato did not typically look for potential mis- carriages between the starting point and the conclusion, so there is little basis for attributing to him an understanding of the logical concepts of validity and fallacy. There is even less basis for thinking that the bad arguments were put there knowingly to tease us, since the plain fact is that that is not the usual reason why good philosophers have put forward bad arguments. And it is no affront to suggest that an author who was writing before logic had been systematized should commit elementary logical blunders, since the plain fact is that good philosophers who have written since logic was systematized have done the same. Presumably no-one can start to theorize about logic unless he already has some prior hunches that certain arguments are</page><page sequence="2">22 I-M. A. STEWART better than others. It is because some arguments carry con- viction, and others do not, that a few people are led to specu- late on why they should or shouldn't do so. The ability to dis- tinguish in a rough and ready way between what does and what does not carry conviction must precede, and may precede by many generations, the identification of general features in argument types. Aristotle did graduate to this theorizing stage, and was no doubt building on exploratory work done one or many generations earlier. What stage does Plato represent in this evolution? Our interpretation of several dialogues hangs, for instance, on whether he thought the Third Man argument cogent, and if so what he thought it cogent against. But we are still some way from reaching any consensus on the matter. I propose to limit my remarks here to a consideration of Plato's understanding of certain techniques or procedures which he attributed deprecatingly to some of the sophists. I look in section I at Euthydemus, the classic text for his presentation of these techniques; but I approach it more obliquely than other recent writers have done by analysing first the Socratic technique that Plato offers as a foil. In sec- tions II and III, with less involvement in textual exegesis, I consider the kind of evidence that some other dialogues offer for Plato's understanding of the sophistic techniques of Euthd. I 1. The Socratic interludes in Euthydemus Euthd. consists of a dialogue within a dialogue. In the inner dialogue, scenes of dazzling verbal knockabout alternate with sober demonstrations of Socratic protreptic. To say that Plato was "forcing a comparison" between eristic and Socratic methods (Sprague (2), p. viii) is to prompt the challenge "methods of what?" and the response that, setting aside Plato's ironic pretence, the two parties are not really working in the same territory. We can perhaps say something fairly general, e.g., that Plato was juxtaposing two methods (?sub- jects) of education, even that he was showing two ways of putting argument to use in education. What I do not think we are entitled to say is that he was pointing a comparison</page><page sequence="3">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 23 between what older commentators on Aristophanes called "good and bad logic", which implies that boundaries are being drawn on the basis of a grasp of certain general or generalizable principles. (a) The first interlude (278e-282e) consists of an exhortation to wisdom arising out of the answer to the question "How are we to have a successful life?" (eu prattein or eudaimonein). There follows a list of goods which fluctuates between the causes and the constituents of success. Some of the oddity that may strike us in translation is due to our not having the Greek conception of a satisfied life. But there is a disastrous argu- ment about the relationship of wisdom to good fortune (eutukhia), whose conclusion is left up in the air: wisdom is good fortune (279d); it is the cause of good fortune (28oa); it renders good fortune redundant (28ob). Apart from being an extravagant induction, the argument is equivocal: flautists and language teachers have the greatest luck with tunes and writing; wise helmsmen generally have better luck at sea; a man has more luck at the hands of a wise commander or physician; so there is good fortune wherever there is (?propor- tionately to) wisdom. Sometimes 'eutukhjs' has an active sense and is used to describe the luck of the specialist, and some- times it has a passive sense and is used to describe the luck of the layman in the specialist's charge. The argument next proceeds to establish that the said goods must be not only possessed but used, and not only used but used properly. The first stage of this argument equivocates between eu prattein as living a successful life, and as perform- ing a task (like carpentry) well (28ocd). The second stage establishes the centrality of knowledge to proper use (281ab) with about as much rigour as the drunkard's argument that established the constancy of soda as the source of his intoxica- tion. Finally, there is an attempt to demonstrate the roughly converse thesis, that, in the case of the ignorant man, the more goods he lacked, the less unsuccessful he would be (281b-d). Gifford ad loc. finds an equivocation reminiscent of the sophists in 'kak6s prattein' ('fare badly', 'do evil'), but I am doubtful about the alleged second sense. The trouble with this last stage of the argument is its first premiss: the fewer goods an ignorant man uses, the fewer errors he will</page><page sequence="4">24 I-M. A. STEWART make. Why? Even if there are fewer error-types open to him, that does not necessitate any diminution in error-tokens. We seem to have a simple fallacy of division. (b) The second interlude (288d-293a) picks up the thread again. Taking up his previous conclusion that in order to have a successful life it was necessary to have knowledge, Socrates now asks "What sort of knowledge?" This question is puzzling. The argument of the first interlude had hinged upon the fact that specific skills were necessary to specific tasks. One kind of wisdom makes the flautist successful, another kind the language teacher (279e), and so on. To ask at 288d "What sort of knowledge would we be right to ac- quire?" is to cast doubt on whether the character of the earlier argument was properly grasped. Socrates was made to have shown how success in particular skills was due to know- ledge of those skills, and had generalized to the point of saying that success was due to knowledge. Then assuming that there is success-in-general, other than success at particular skills, he tries to find the skill which yields this success. There is a shift from doing well at particular skills to doing well in general. Yet the question at 288d is not a question about knowledge in general, but about knowledge in particular; and all the candidates from 289b ff. are particular skills, like generalship. It is the question what particular sort of knowledge leads to one's doing well in general. And that, in the context, is an incoherent question. There is something equally odd about the proposed answer, or criterion for the answer, "that it would be one which will benefit us" (288e). In the earlier discussion it was precisely be- cause knowledge was beneficial, in so far as knowledge was the thing that ensured the right use of goods, that it was introduced at all. Socrates was looking for those things whose possession and use would bring benefit, and he identified them with knowledge and those goods which are accompanied by knowledge. But suddenly it is implied that only one sort of knowledge is beneficial: a knowledge "not just of produc- tion"-as if production had already been discussed-but of use. So he starts to reject all the special skills, of money- making, flute-playing, writing, etc., upon which his earlier argument for the centrality of knowledge was constructed,</page><page sequence="5">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 25 since they are arts of either producing or using but not both (288e-29od). Here again he has kicked away the ladder he was climbing up. From what we know elsewhere, it is no surprise that we fail to discover a skill which combines pro- duction with use, since Plato's Industrial Relations rules didn't allow one. He has Socrates take one more step into the morass before giving up. The ultimate skill-in-general, which will lead to success-in-general, has to produce something useful in parti- cular, and that means something good in particular. (Pre- viously the inference had been the other way about, from good to useful.) But if it has to produce something good, that means some sort of knowledge. What particular knowledge? A knowledge of something good; and bearing in mind what that must be Socrates finally says "a knowledge which conveys nothing but itself" (292d). In trying to block that regress, he tumbles into another, suggesting it is a knowledge which makes others good, i.e., makes them make others good, etc. These sophistic-style 'babblings' (Arist. SE 173a 32ff.) are the proper consequence of the false moves Socrates has been mak- ing throughout the second interlude, in retaining his con- clusions from the first interlude while simultaneously making a set of new assumptions about a universal skill inconsistent with the data for those conclusions. The assumptions and the conclusions are alike typical of Plato. There are parallels elsewhere for his belief in a master skill and for the paradoxes this brought with it; parallels too to show that, though he be- lieved profoundly in a tie-up between knowledge and good, he had to resort to myth to express it. I therefore doubt if Plato knew where he had gone wrong in the arguments I have just run through. If one studies the preferred or Socratic uses of argument in Euthd., then, it appears that Plato was proficient at develop- ing epagogic and syllogistic arguments, sometimes of consider- able ingenuity. He seems however not to have been too clear about the nature of what he was doing, since he implicitly revokes some of the premisses of his arguments once he has got the conclusion. He sometimes exploits the ambiguity of ambiguous terms. Certain metaphysical assumptions, e.g., about knowledge and ignorance in the first Socratic scene</page><page sequence="6">26 I-M. A. STEWART and about the relationship between a master skill and total success-in-general in the second one, have a stronger hold on him than ordinary logic does. For these assumptions are not argued for, and when they lead to logical tangles they are not recognized or withdrawn. 2. The eristic scenes in Euthydemus I now turn to a sample of the avowedly sophistic arguments of Euthd., to consider whether they are really significantly worse than those ascribed to Socrates. What is not in dispute is that, whether better or worse, they are adapted to a different use, but that may be a function of Plato's caricature. (a) Round 1 begins at 275d with the question: "who are the people who learn (manthanontes)?" Each of two poten- tially ambiguous replies-"the knowledgeable/prudent" (sophoi) and the "the ignorant/foolish" (amatheis)-is rebut- ted, by trading in each case on the sense of the terms that the interlocutor no doubt did not intend. The rebuttal proceeds from apparently innocent premisses, about teaching and dictating, which unconsciously influence one's interpretation of the key terms. Given the premisses and the interpretation, each is cogent enough; but because the interpretation is the wrong one each argument is a case of ignoratio elenchi. The initial question treats contraries as contradictories; but that was as much a Socratic as a sophistic habit (28oc, 28oe, 281c). Then follows another question: "do people who learn learn what they know or what they don't know?" (276d). This is applied to the specific case of learning one's grammata, and the ambiguity between "learning the ABC" and "learning one's texts" is exploited in rebutting the negative. The re- buttal of the affirmative however rests not on this ambiguity of what it is that is learnt, but on the premiss that knowledge is a possession-as though there might have been another, un- possessed sort of knowledge on the other horn of the dilemma. How far did Plato understand what was going on here? We could try to use the asymmetry of the second pair of argu- ments (276d-277c) as evidence that he only half understood, or the fact that he used the more boorish of the sophists, Dionysodorus, to break the symmetry as evidence that he understood pretty well. The text provides three explicit com-</page><page sequence="7">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 27 ments (277e-278b): (i) there is an ambiguity in 'manthanein', the verb normally rendered 'learn'; (ii) the sophists are trying to bring this out; (iii) this linguistic knowledge is childish and frivolous, and its only use is in mocking and discomforting people. (i) It is said that 'manthanein' is used both of the process of which knowledge is the result (i.e., learning) and of the overseeing of what is already known (which is Plato's way of characterizing understanding). How does that help the crea- tion of the antinomy? The question was whether it is the knowledgeable/prudent or the ignorant/foolish who are manthanontes. Suppose that 'manthanontes' is deliberately ambiguous, but that the other terms are not, so that we are meant to read them univocally. Then the question may be whether it is the knowledgeable or the ignorant who learn/ understand, or it may be whether it is the prudent or the foolish who learn/understand; and we just have to guess which one was unambiguously in Plato's mind. But if the dilemma relates univocally to the prudent-or-foolish, it can- not be constructed, for whereas the first horn would be secure ("the prudent learn") there is no second horn (there are no "foolish who understand"). So it would have to be a dilemma univocally about the knowledgeable-or-ignorant. Such a dilemma can indeed be constructed ("the ignorant learn: the knowledgeable understand") but it is not the one in the text, since at 276c it is the sophoi who memorize their dictation. In short, the whole exercise will only work if we grant the 'knowledgeable'/'prudent' and 'ignorant'/'foolish' ambigu- ities; but if we do grant those then the 'learn' /'understand' ambiguity is redundant. The same holds for the second dilemma, which hinges upon the ambiguity of 'grammata' (or, elsewhere in the same passage, upon an ambiguity in ta apostomatizomena as what is dictated). Certainly the learning of grammata at one level presupposes not only the learning but the understanding of grammata at another level, but this does not show we needed a word for 'understanding' to con- struct the dilemma. Plato sensed there was an ambiguity here- abouts, but misplaced it. The real ambiguity, which he mis- sed, was an ambiguity of an everyday kind, where within one and the same context each of two senses of a word is a live</page><page sequence="8">28 I-M. A. STEWART option. The unreal ambiguity, which he found, was merely notional, analogous to that in English between 'game' as the name of what you play and 'game' as the name of what you hunt-a potential ambiguity which in ordinary cases is resolved by the context.' (ii) It is said twice, at 277e and 278a, that the sophists by their antics aim to bring out the alleged ambiguity. Socrates dissociates himself from this aim, belittling it; so he is not trying to bring out any ambiguities. Because Socrates does grudgingly try to explain one of them most critics conclude that it was one of Plato's purposes in the dialogue to expose the ambiguities and other sophistic knacks, and the sophists' aim to hide them. This is standing the text on its head. Since explicit comment in the text is minimal (the sophistries being for the most part merely expounded), we must assume either that to expound is to expose, or that Plato is exposing very few sophistries; and if to expound is to expose, then since it is the sophists who incur Plato's censure for expounding them, the exposure is no credit to him. Since logically sophisticated modern critics who are assuming that to expound is to expose are not always agreed in their interpretations of the arguments exposed, it is unclear why they should think that the tacit ex- posure was so transparent to logically unsophisticated Greeks, particularly if they also think that it was not transparent to the audience of the sophists. (iii) Plato's censure here is perfectly coherent. If the am- biguity of 'manthanein' is taken as a paradigm, then not only is his dismissive attitude to it understandable, but his claim that the study of it is only fit for party pranks is true. The 'learn'/'understand' ambiguity is no more serious than the English ambiguity in 'game': it evaporates in a normal con- text. Another example is in the discussion of the 'sense' (nojsis, 287c-e) of a phrase, where the sophists labour to im- pose anthropomorphic features on words. These are "those crass ambiguities out of which puns are made" (Robinson, p. 29). Once we grant that Plato misunderstood the subtlety of the original antinomies (based on 'sophos' and 'amathis') and thought them based on childish puns ('manthanein'), we can dispense with the wishful thinking involved in the com- ment that the knowledge of ambiguity "is characterized as a</page><page sequence="9">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 29 mere prelude to serious inquiry into the reality of things" (Levinson, p. 265), or that the sophists' tricks are dismissed by Plato because their acknowledged consciousness of ambiguity "could be put to serious use, but in fact is not" (Sprague (i), pp. 7-8n.). The prelude is only a dramatic one, and Plato did not propose it as a genuine preliminary to anything what- ever: there is no end, except play, to which puns are a means. But why trying to instruct people about ambiguity would not be putting one's knowledge of it to serious use, and what more serious use there would be, I do not see; Plato's own point, however, is that it is knowledge that of its nature has no serious use, because it cannot improve you and leaves you no wiser as to the nature of things. If he has overlooked its use in asking and answering questions about improvement and the nature of things-in fact, its use in philosophy-this is be- cause he was not concerned with ordinary conversational ambiguity. (b) Round 2, beginning at 283b, centres round some of the stock puzzles about being and not-being. The text is short on explicit comment. If people wish Cleinias to become wise, says Dionysodorus at 283d, they wish him to become who or what (he) is not (hos ouk esti), and no longer to be who or what (he) now is (hos esti nun), so they wish him dead. Now that scholars are becoming more circumspect about crediting Plato with the recognition of different senses of 'einai' ('be') in Sophist, we have less reason to think he recognized the distinction be- tween copulative and existential uses here. But that in any case is merely a symptom of the real shift. The friends of Cleinias wish him to be no longer "what he is now", but that becomes a wish that he, who is now, should no longer be. In the latter case 'hos' ('who', 'what') is subject of 'esti' ('is') and the whole phrase qualifies 'auton' ('him'), the subject of the wish. In the other case 'hos' is complement of 'esti' and the whole phrase is the complement of the verb contained in the wish. There are then quite complicated structural changes, involving not 'esti' but the whole phrase 'hos esti' and its relationship to the rest of the sentence: changes which Plato, even if he felt them, had no apparatus for describing. The paradoxes about false speaking (283e ff.) are again due</page><page sequence="10">30 I-M. A. STEWART to grammatical ambiguities, even if they then give rise to ambiguities in the meaning of individual words as well. When one says something (legei), one says "something that is"; so if one says "something that is not" one says nothing. Now 'legein' is open to several interpretations. One can 'mention' or 'call' someone or something; one can 'utter' words; one can 'report that' something is the case. There is a distinction be- tween the use of the verb with a direct object and its use with a following statement. Within the first, its use with a direct object, there is a distinction between cognate and non-cognate object. The sense in which "saying that which is not" entails "not saying" (the sense in which legein is a kind of poiein: 284bc) is the sense in which the verb is followed by a cognate object, a term expressing a type of utterance. The equivoca- tion between uttering no utterance and uttering an untruth thus arises from a failure to distinguish internal from other accusatives. Again Plato, even if he felt this distinction, had no apparatus for describing it. Another argument involves a move from "Good men de- scribe things the way they are" to "Good men describe bad things badly" (284d, ignoring a pun on 'agathoi'). Dionysod- orus means that the good speak incompetently of bad things, but Ctesippus changes the sense to retort that they will speak ill of bad men. There is not exactly an equivocation or fallacy in the latter case, since it is not part of the argument. There is however an ambiguity in 'kakds legein' ('speak ill') according to whether the reference is to the speaker's fluency or his atti- tudes, and this is at root a problem of the syntactic relation- ship between 'kakbs' and 'legein'. Dionysodorus exploited a similar structural ambiguity in switching from the matter ('hos ekhei legousin') to the manner of the speech ('kakos legousin'). (c) In Round 3 (293a-304b), though Socrates and his friends make little explicit comment on the bad arguments, they several times try to turn the tables on the sophists, which presupposes some grasp of what is going on. There is a move from knowing/not knowing some particular things to being in the know/being ignorant simpliciter (293bc, 296a-c), which involves the fallacy of secundum quid. It depends among other things on the concession that it is impossible for</page><page sequence="11">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 31 something to have a certain character, and not have the same character, at the same time (293c). This is not the law of non- contradiction, but rather an assumption at the back of several of the sophistries in the final section, that a relative term and its negation are contradictory irrespectively of whether they are relating the same things. Plato himself seems to have seen the point, both because of the counter-moves he allows to Socrates and because of his proverb about not combining flax with flax at 298c. There is then a succession of exercises involving the misuse or misalignment of relative and absolute notions, e.g., of brother and father, same and different, mine and yours, of which the sophism about the dog which is yours and a father, hence a father of yours (298de), is the most famous. One special instance of these manoeuvres concerns the distinction between a beautiful object and the unquali- fiedly beautiful (3ooe-3ola), which Socrates moves to save; but in emulation (30o b) of the sophists he avoids serious philo- sophical engagement by petulantly blocking their question. 3. Assessment My co-symposiast has performed a valuable service in re- viving interest in Euthd. through her provocative monograph and her annotated translation (Sprague (i) and (2)). If I have so far ignored her interpretations of the arguments it is be- cause I think it more useful in the short space allowed to stake out a constructive position, and even this can only be done with an unintended air of dogmatism. But anyone who com- pares the detail of Mrs. Sprague's books with my own account above will readily recognize that we are divided on nearly every particular. The disagreement is both on technicalities (e.g., whether a fallacy of composition is detectable in the argument about grammata, or the dog-and-father argument, or whether both passages can be illustrating the same fallacy anyway), and on the whole strategy of the dialogue. She is so convinced that every sophistic turn embodies a fallacy that she sometimes has them embodying two or three different fallacies inconsistently; whereas I do not find a fallacy in every sophistic argument, and certainly do not see it as a differentia- ting mark between the sophistic and Socratic argumentation in Euthd. Equivocation and secundum quid are the fallacies</page><page sequence="12">32 I-M. A. STEWART Mrs. Sprague finds preponderantly throughout, fallacies she thinks Plato had so clearly mastered here that if his own arguments used them elsewhere then there must be an ulterior strategy. Thus the second sophistic scene is an ex- posure of Eleatic logic and thereby of the basis of the meta- physics which denied genesis. If Plato made similar moves himself elsewhere we must see if he wasn't using an essentially ad hominem argument against an explicitly or implicitly Eleatic position. But at other times she seems to dispense with the need for a specifically Eleatic target. If Mrs. Sprague had been able to sustain the stronger thesis that the sophistical refutations in Plato are predominantly used in tracing out the internal false logic of an opponent's (e.g., an Eleatic) position, that would have been an exciting thesis; but she cannot and does not try. Her weaker thesis, that he used fallacies to which an interlocutor need not be committed in order to direct discussion in philosophically con- structive directions, seems to me to have no more explanatory value than the more conventional thesis that Plato often de- veloped his own case by bad arguments. It cannot promote a more sympathetic understanding to add that he was con- scious of the fallacy of his arguments: partly because it is part of the concept of fallacy that it won't do, and partly be- cause he was so explicit, when discussing the linguistic exper- tise of the sophists at Euthd. 278ab, that it had no philoso- phical potential whatever. If Euthd. is to provide a basis for the interpretation of other dialogues, we must start from something firmer than the misreading of 278ab. To my mind the evidence of Euthd. is insufficient to support Mrs. Sprague's interpretations of other dialogues. What we need instead is an uncommitted reading of other dialogues to see if these can advance our understanding of Euthd. On its own, Euthd. shows us that Plato recognized the existence of ambiguity of a kind, that on the rare occasions when he tried to identify it he was not altogether right, and that he saw no serious application for the exercise. For an argument to have a serious application, its conclusion had to have some practical relevance of a non-verbal character. In the second sophistic scene Ctesippus and Socrates react to the sophists' conclusions and do not tackle their arguments. In</page><page sequence="13">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 33 the third round there is no general rule about the unquali- fied use of qualified phrases (and indeed only some of the arguments do involve secundum quid), but there are com- ments on a few individual cases ad hoc. We may note the pre- dominance of syllogistic over epagogic reasoning in eristic argument compared with Socratic; so there is less collection of instances in the premises and a greater impression of apriorism. Whether or not Plato intended this difference, it seems to be the consequence of something that he did mean to convey, namely, that eristic is the activity of empty minds. It makes no metaphysical assumptions, for it makes no assump- tions at all. I do not accept that the sophists in Euthd. come over as bona fide Eleatics, for Plato took the threat of Eleaticism seriously but he did not take these particular sophists seriously. This does not so far amount to very much: an aversion to the conclusions of arguments, if they are unedifying or un- congenial; a hostility to the unqualified use of qualified phrases; and a wish not to know about ambiguity-which was certainly fulfilled, if Plato did both misidentify the ambigu- ities in the first round and also miss the ambiguities in his own model discussions. This does not add up to a general con- sciousness of fallacy on Plato's part, a consciousness that certain general types of move can lead one from true premises to false conclusions. For at most two sorts of illustrations are used, involving ambiguity and secundum quid, and the theoretical discussion is in the case of both sorts confined to some of the specific illustrations. But although we disagree on much of the detail, I do not disagree at all with Mrs. Sprague's fully justified admiration for the intricate structure of the dialogue. In commenting on the different bouts of sophistic argument, I have hinted at something I now wish to make explicit. The arguments offered by the sophists in Round 1 trade on terms which are individually ambiguous. Plato had only a glimmering of this; he mislocated the ambiguity. What mat- ters much more is that he either felt or was led to believe that these arguments somehow went in a set. In Round 2 the arguments centre round ambiguities of a different kind- structural or syntactic ambiguities and not ambiguities in the</page><page sequence="14">34 I-M. A. STEWART meaning of individual words. I do not think that Plato under- stood the technicalities of this since the Greek study of Greek grammar only reached its infancy in his own work in Soph. some years later, and certainly in that phase could not give a correct account of all the ambiguities involved in Euthd. What matters is that Plato felt that these arguments somehow went in a set, and that it is a different set from the set of simple semantic ambiguities. When we come to Round 3 there are many arguments which do not involve secundum quid as well as some which do. What unites the arguments in Round 3 is that they almost all in different degrees and different ways involve the use of terms which carry with them some kind of relativity, where the arguments hinge upon a distinction between relative and absolute, qualified and un- qualified, uses. I doubt if Plato saw this fully, because it would involve him in seeing that a term like 'emos' ('my') has a different sort of dependence in a sentence from something like a colour epithet, so that the kinds of moves that are pos- sible with the one are barred to the other. (Plato himself at Rep. 454c ff. and Aristotle at SE 179a 26ff. made some theoreti- cal comments in this area, but both resorted to something like an essence-accident distinction, which does not quite catch the nature of the fallacy. 'Being angry' is an 'accident', yet there is no fallacy in moving from 'angry'+ 'father' to 'angry father'.) But even if Plato did not quite put his finger on the errors, he felt that the arguments in the third set by and large went together. At all events they do go together, and con- sidered as a group they are to be kept apart from either of the other two groups. It is quite natural that an intelligent person with a native command of Greek should instinctively feel that the argu- ments belonged with the groups in question without neces- sarily being able to express precisely what it was that deter- mined the group's membership. This is one of those hunches about the way arguments do and do not carry conviction which form the beginning of logical speculation, and one would assume such a stage in the prehistory of logic even if Plato's text did not provide it. It is therefore possible that Plato's sorting of these arguments into batches was partly un- conscious. Or it could be that he had lifted them bodily from some sophistic manual, in which case it was someone else's</page><page sequence="15">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 35 sorting of them which had been unconscious, and then our problem is to know whether Plato took the sorting seriously, or was only satirizing those who did. Whether we can say it represents more than a series of hunches, or a satire on a series of hunches, of this pre-formal kind depends on what other dialogues give us to go on, where Plato was engaged in argument of a more normal less self-conscious sort. So a full study of the subject should now broaden into an investigation of Plato's handling of semantic ambiguity, structural am- biguity, and the use of relative and qualified expressions, in other dialogues. I have the space to do this only very impres- sionistically. II Since it was not Plato's practice in the dialogues to ask ques- tions of the kind "What does 'x' mean?", eo ipso it was not his practice to ask whether 'x' means two things rather than one. His definition-questions were of the kind "What is x?", which led him when necessary to distinguish kinds of x; but one can do that only if 'x' is univocal, for otherwise they are not kinds of the same thing at all. Modern definition-questions tend to be asked of words, which can be regarded on occasion, with perfect propriety, as equivocal. Since ancient and modern conceptions of definition are based on incompatible assumptions, then, translators and commentators who have Plato ask semantic questions, when there is nothing like a semantic method in his answers, are only imposing gratuitous confusions. Cornford's influence has been particularly baneful here. Some of the confusion is well-intentioned (presenting Plato in a modern dress), but much of it is due to philosophi- cal haziness (equating meanings with universals), or to straight carelessness (having him enquire into English words). One stretch of argument whose strategy can only be under- stood by keeping clear this distinction between real and lexical definition is the well known passage (Tht. 163a ff.) which more than one writer of Inaugural Lectures has wrongly cited as the first exposure of a category mistake. To rebut the equation of knowledge with perception, the speakers try interchanging words associated with perception with words associated with knowledge, in selected contexts, and generate contradictions (either real or spurious) or</page><page sequence="16">36 I-M. A. STEWART solecisms; but the technique is dismissed as eristic, and verbal agreement (164c) is said to offer no basis for a proper rebuttal. This "verbal agreement" (homologia, mistranslated by Fowler and others as 'similarity') is nothing to do with ambiguity (which Plato characterized as "verbal difference": Euthd. 278b). It consists quite simply in the matching of knowledge- talk with perception-talk (see 164b init.). Now if Plato had been offering a lexical definition, so that definiens and definiendum could be claimed to be synonyms, to have the same meaning, then the eristic rebuttal would have been per- fectly proper. Thus it is quite correct to argue that English 'know' and 'perceive' are not synonyms, in so far as "I per- ceived it obscurely in the distance" does not translate over into "I knew it obscurely in the distance". But it no more proves that knowledge and perception are not the same, than the non-synonymy of the designations used in making any true identity-statement proves that that statement is false. It is not just individual arguments, but whole dialogues, whose structure can only be understood by dissociating ques- tions of definition from considerations of meaning. Near the start of Soph., at 218c, the Eleatic remarks that, although the speakers share the use of the word 'sophistes', they are likely to apply it each to different things. This is illustrated through six putative definitions of the sophist, as the parasite of the rich young men, the itinerant dealer in learning, the resident teacher, the self-sufficient polymath, the teacher of forensic disputation, and the philosophic dialectician. Now we might well say that 'sophistis' was ambiguous, having one sense as applied to the self-sufficient Hippias, another as applied to the resident tutors at the gymnasium (cf. Lys. 204a), another as applied to Socrates, and so on; but then we cannot then go on, after already listing six senses, to ask what it really means. Plato, on the other hand, could consistently, if not very plaus- ibly, take note of the discrepant usage and ask what real pro- fession could possibly deceive people into thinking it could masquerade under such conflicting forms. The effect of the dialogue is to define the 'real' sophist as the Euthydemus-style total charlatan (as Plato conceived him) and implicitly to exonerate the individual professions, including the dialecti- cian, to whom the name had often got attached.</page><page sequence="17">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 37 There is also in Plato's method of definition a second disin- centive to find multiple meanings in words. Certain kinds of multivalency present no problem: Plato like other Greek writers was sensitive to etymological puns; and there is no reason to suppose that he couldn't in general tell the differen- ces between technical and non-technical, or metaphorical and literal, usage in his own writing, even if his readers cannot always do as much. Rather, what I have in mind is what Robinson (p. 17) has unsympathetically called "falla- cious analogy", which for Plato was a form of constructive re- classification. In saying in Stts. that the statesman weaves to- gether the components of society Plato did not run away, and did not expect anyone else to run away, with the idea that a household loom was a population machine. Homely com- parisons come naturally to anyone educated on Homer. But instead of saying as we might that of course the statesman does not really weave, he was more likely to see the loom-user as only one of many kinds of weaver. What to us is verbal innova- tion was to him an integral part of synag6gi. These theoretical considerations do not of themselves show that Plato had little conception of the pervasiveness of verbal ambiguity, but what they do is to dismantle for Plato some of the framework within which we find its identification rela- tively easy and commonsensical. This may prompt the ques- tion whether it is proper to regard Plato's vocabulary as genuinely ambiguous at all. Envisage the English-language community which distinguishes blue from green. Envisage another speech community which marks no such boundary and has a single word 'bleen'. It would be false to say that 'bleen' is ambiguous and a potential source of equivocation. By analogy, our variant translations of Greek 'dikaios', 'eudaiman', etc., are no evidence that Plato's usage was equivocal, but only that our own concepts are different. Even so it is possible for a word in a language to be ambiguous un- beknownst to native speakers, and those ambiguities can generate equivocation. There are relatively formal techniques for their detection, as Lyons shows, involving study of the distribution of the word across different kinds of sentence environment and its relations with semantically allied terms in the different environments.</page><page sequence="18">38 I-M. A. STEWART The cases both for and against Plato's indifference to am- biguity can be overdone from not being clear about which distinctions properly belong to the mind of the commentator and which to the original text. For example, (a) it is common now, as Cross and Woozley do, to charge Plato in Rep. with confusing knowledge by acquaintance with propositional knowledge, and with picking the wrong one as the knowledge which is contrasted with belief. But this seems to me only to prove the insensitivity of such critics to Greek idiom, in which the suppressed propositions can easily enough be reconstruc- ted, and it is traceable to a time when earlier commentators fathered on to Plato some of the fashionable philosophical nonsense that they themselves believed. This does not how- ever mean that Plato himself knew about the distinction and made a deliberate selection: since he also thought that "knowledge is single" (Soph. 257c), it probably never crossed his mind. (b) On the other side of the critical fence, Mrs. Sprague has detected equivocations in the argument of Hp. Mi. which, because the speakers express discontent with their own argument, she presumes Plato had identified (Sprague (1), ch. 4). The line of argument in that dialogue may be paradoxical, establishing that only the good could deliberately do wrong, but it is not more so than the thesis that no-one does wrong deliberately and appears to complement that thesis. It is thus not clear that Plato meant it to be regarded as sophistical rather than (cf. 372d) genuinely puzzling; and even less clear that, if it is sophistical, he would have known why. Mrs. Sprague detects equivocations in the meaning both of 'hek6n' and allied terms (as including and excluding desire) and of 'agathos' and allied terms ('morally good'/'skilled'). A sensitivity to the pitfalls in modern talk about the voluntary, the involuntary and the desired shows that we must watch our translations, but it does not establish to my mind that Plato was working here with anything other than a simple dichot- omy between acts that are and aren't deliberate; while a puritan distinction between someone's 'virtue' as a man and his 'skill' as a carpenter, etc., goes in the face of Plato's re- peated attempts to model the one on the other (different aretai, of course, but not different senses of 'areti'). Mrs. Sprague might be willing to rephrase her criticism of the argument, to say that there is some inconsistency in what</page><page sequence="19">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 39 people are being regarded as good at, for she herself (p. 67) notes the use of incomplete predicates (like 'dunatos') to ad- vance an earlier stage of the argument. But she has not yet convinced me that the argumentation is positively equivo- cal-rather than, say, one more of Plato's typically hazardous inductions. (c) Thirdly, there are supposed to be places where no reading between the lines is needed, because Plato is ex- plicit about some ambiguities, just as he was in Euthd. Alas, not only are these passages conspicuous by their rarity (a rarity that is quite striking when Plato's text is juxtaposed against Aristotle's), but they tend to reinforce my low estimate of his success in Euthd. Thus something tantamount to a distinction between two senses of 'epistasthai' is drawn at Tht. 197a ff. (knowing as possessing and knowing as grasping). The only trouble is that it doesn't have those two senses. Something close to a distinction between two senses of the negative is drawn in Soph., and he gets that wrong too. Despite these comments, I believe that most readers must find in the dialogues too much equivocal argument for com- fort. Lys. is perhaps a sufficiently slight work for the well known active-passive tension in 'philbn' ('befriending' and 'befriended') to be put down to immaturity: after all, some- thing had to be Plato's clumsiest extant work. But similar charges can be levelled against dialogues of undoubted seriousness and maturity. Take Phd. Death is nothing but the separation of body from soul and soul from body (64c); so souls 'die' (77d, 84b); so why the fuss about proving them 'death- less' (lo5e)? At birth our souls "come into being" from the dead (7oc); so how can they have been in being all along (ibid.)? If 'our' souls existed before 'we' came into being (77c) and will continue afterwards, in what sense were they 'ours', and why is it "verbally improper" ( 115e) to identify Socrates with anything other than his soul? These various conjunctions of statements are incompatible with a merely univocal use of terms like 'tethnanai', 'gignesthai', 'egO'. Again, if having for- gotten something involves no longer knowing it, then it is forgetfulness beyond recall; if the forgetfulness is moment- ary, and can give way to subsequent recall, then the attendant knowledge is a precondition and not a consequence of the re- call. By insisting that we are born without knowledge (76ab) Plato committed himself to the soul's having forgotten in the</page><page sequence="20">40 I-M. A. STEWART strong sense, so that it really does have to learn afresh. The Recollection argument can never get off the ground. Or take Tht. The identification of knowledge with percep- tion is potentially equivocal. As in Rep. a decision is needed on whether Plato was talking of propositional knowledge, or something else coordinate or superordinate, and this time it is more crucial since he is now trying to reach a definition. The dialogue in practice is concerned preponderantly not even with propositional knowledge but, as commonly in Plato, with one specialized kind of propositional knowledge-know- ing what something is (=knowing that it is whatever thing it is); why else Plato's particular grounds for finally rejecting the equation with perception, his obsession with problems of misidentification in the middle pages, and his fruitless treat- ment of logos in the sense of 'specification' (sc. of the thing known about) instead of the sense of 'rationale' (sc. of the judgment itself) which he had correctly associated with know- ledge in Meno? But other propositional knowledge cannot be altogether excluded, since a wide range of purported know- ledge-claims are discussed in the attack on Protagoras; and so some charge of insensitivity to the meaning of 'logos' appro- priate to the dialogue seems inescapable. The primary am- biguity however belongs to the talk of perception. The sense in which, for any ordinary Greek speaker, perception was unmistakably allied to knowledge was its propositional sense, as we in English speak of 'sensing', i.e., 'apprehending', that something is the case (cf. Plato's own use of 'aisthanesthai' at Lys. 2o09d, Rep. 5ood and elsewhere), where there is a built-in judgmental element. The development of a psychological theory of the five senses operating in opposition to the judg- ment was a late technical development; and for Plato to con- flate the two was to secure himself too easy a victory. The suggestion that Plato had little understanding of am- biguity has been put most starkly by Robinson, and in this form has elicited some curiously panic reactions. Levinson (pp. 277-9) musters a battery of references from the Lexicon to antilogia, eris, etc., with a baffling disregard for what is actually going on in the contexts. Thus he quotes 'kompsos' ('clever', Soph. 259c) as what a sophistic argument is, when it is actually what it is not. He amalgamates 'ambiguity' with</page><page sequence="21">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 41 'contradiction'; and he misunderstands Plato's correction of an etymology at Crat. 437a as a reference to equivocal mean- ing. (So, incidentally, does Robinson, p. 27.) But Levinson does by his choice of quotations inadvertently produce evi- dence for a different view of Plato's practice which it is worth briefly developing. The dialogues are full of remarks like 'ti legeis?' ("what are you saying?"). These are enquiries not into utterance meaning, and so not into ambiguities in utterance meaning, but into person's meaning. Of course words do not have a meaning independently of what people have been apt to mean in using them, and 'person's meaning' is something of a catch- all phrase.' All that needs to be granted for my present pur- pose is that, whatever the ultimate relationship between utter- ance meaning and person's meaning, there are familiar enough ways in which they can be contrasted. Two will suffice here. One is where there may be ambiguity of reference with- out ambiguity of sense. (If I ask "Have you seen that book I was reading?" the meaning of 'book' poses no problems of comprehension, nor does the meaning of any other word in the sentence; but you may have no idea which book, or which of several books, I mean.) Tht. 2o6c ff. is a simple example of a text in which person's meaning-what the proponent of the definition of knowledge meant or was referring to in using the word 'logos'-is expressly considered. In so far as Plato tended not to differentiate senses of an equivocal 'x' and saw himself as differentiating kinds of a univocally-named x, he could get a fair way on the wrong distinction. Secondly, questions as to what a person means may some- times be requests for the clarification of an obscurity, which is something different from an ambiguity. For example, when (if) Heraclitus said 'panta rhei', the meaning of his words is wholly unequivocal. There is nothing problematic about saying that everything is in flux. What is unclear is the kind and degree of flux that Heraclitus had in mind. No amount of intensive exploration into what his words meant will illumine the obscurity in what he meant here. Again, when Protagoras uttered his 'man-measure' dictum, there is an ambiguity in the last word. Protagoras may have been speaking about the individual man, or about mankind in general. That is the</page><page sequence="22">42 I-M. A. STEWART only serious ambiguity in the sentence, the only thing that poses a problem in translation. But what Protagoras was saying when he propounded this dictum is quite another story, about what he meant to do with the dictum and what he meant us to do with it. So when Untersteiner in The Sophists devoted a lengthy 'excursus' to a philological analysis of it, 'ex cursu' was an apter description than he knew. Prota- goras' dictum is not seriously ambiguous; it is radically opaque. Theaetetus' definition of knowledge, with which Plato at one stage conjoined it, is not opaque, but it is as we have seen ambiguous. Plato directed his thoughts, and the course of his discussions, to what people meant, rather than to what their words meant, where in many cases it would have helped first to clear up what their words meant. He was thus good at spotting obscurities, and not good at spotting ambiguities. III The discussion in Tht. of the Protagorean principle that as anything appears to a man so it is for him offers examples both of syntactic ambiguity and of the misuse of relative or quali- fied expressions. Thus the principle is compromised to the extent of disallowing that whatever appears beneficial to a community is beneficial to it (172ab), where 'sumpheronta hautei' (or 'ophelimon', 179a) is misread as 'benefiting the state' instead of 'beneficial in the state's judgment'. This pas- sage comes in the wake of a discussion of attributes like justice and injustice, where the transition between the two uses of the dative construction is hidden under the thesis that justice, etc., is law-based (nomima, 172a); for in law collective judgment and reality coincide.3 In the same context are several occasions of secundum quid -moves from attributions of the type 'is for x' or 'is true for x' to 'is' or 'is true' simpliciter-in order to manoeuvre Protagoras into contradiction (171a-c; cf. Crat. 386c). Now elsewhere this kind of false move certainly is resisted, not just in Euthd. (293c, 296a-c), but also at Rep. 436c-e (where a man and a top can be spoken of both as moving and as station- ary, in different respects); and indeed the majority of moves that Plato elsewhere identified as 'eristic' hinge upon a rela-</page><page sequence="23">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 43 tive-absolute shift of one kind or another (Phd. ioia-e, Rep. 454a ff., 479a ff., etc.)4 Such counter-evidence does not show that the sophistical argument must have been put into Tht. deliberately; merely that he tended to watch himself in such contexts, but was not such a complete master of secundum quid that he could always spot where he was exploiting it for his own ends. The Tht. examples involve the notions of 'being' and 'truth'. Now Plato's normal way out of the spurious contradictions generated by secundum quid was to say that something has the character in question "in one way but not in another", and then explain the two ways. How does one do that with 'being'? For Plato, as his discussion of being and not-being in Soph. shows, what is in any way at all thereby at least is; and at Rep. 477a ff., where there is probably a dis- tinction between the unqualifiedly and the qualifiedly true, there is no suggestion that the latter is not true. Thus both the second and third type of Euthd. sophistry can occur in Plato's own argument, although we may be able to construct the association of ideas behind particular cases. Here, as with semantic ambiguity in section II above, the way to make sympathetic sense of Plato's apparently sophistical reasoning is to trace the kinds of assumptions on which he could have failed to see what we can see. If the cases can be explained in this way, does it show that he had at least a reasonable understanding of the relevant false moves in Euthd., and was at least generally sensitive to the fallacy of such moves elsewhere? In the nature of the case we have no real evidence about the ones that got away-the other false moves that Plato either could have made or deliberately eschewed. We do not know how far the extant works represent the tip of the iceberg, and how far they are the iceberg. My guess on the evidence is that he stepped fairly carefully round secundum quid, and ad hoc explanations should be sought for the occasional lapses. Though his lapses in matters of syntactic ambiguity were equally occasional, this can well be because troublesome cases of syntactic ambiguity are intrinsically rare. No doubt if Aristotle's informal explanation of some (Chomsky-style) syntactic ambiguities at SE 166a 22ff. had been put to him, Plato could have understood it and agreed with it. But these are ambiguities that may arise between an</page><page sequence="24">44 I-M. A. STEWART author and his reader. Unlike the semantic ambiguities, they are not ambiguities over which an author can normally de- ceive himself. Whether Plato definitively solved the relevant Euthd. paradoxes in Soph. may be open to debate, but there is no evidence that he ever actually fell for them; and the ones which he did fall for (like 'sumpheronta hautei') perhaps arose from unusual sets of circumstances.

NOTES 1 An examination of the data on Plato's epistemic vocabulary collected in Lyons, pt. II, confirms the suspicion that the use of 'manthanein'= 'sunienai' ('understand') is often conclusively determined by the grammatical environ- ment in which the word occurs, and at other times by the interaction of grammar and subject-matter. The number of genuinely neutral contexts is negligible, though Euthd. 275d may provide one (either deliberate or acci- dental) example. Lyons p. 2 12n. gives an accurate formal analysis of the ambiguity alleged by Socrates in the text, but represents it as the outcome of objective tests on the Greek vocabulary uninfluenced by Socrates's elucidation. However he has in fact loaded the evidence by misrepresenting the imperfect tense 'emanthanon' at 276c as a present tense form (the imperfect occurs in both halves of the antinomy, 276a/276c); by ruling arbitrarily on the inter- pretation of 'ta apostomatizomena' at 276c in a way which overlooks the asso- ciated terminology of 277b; and by ignoring the interrelation of the correla- tive concepts of manthanein and didaskein (learning and teaching) throughout the development of the antinomy. 2 I have put forward some ideas on the relationship in Royal Inst. of Phil. Lectures to (1975/6) and do not wish to pursue it here. 3 The nomos-phusis debate among the sophists was over whether justice, etc., was law-based or nature-based; but it is amusing to see how critics tradi- tionally vary the translations in different passages to ensure that any given sophist was always on the discreditable side-the phusis supporters come out as anti-law anarchists and the nomos supporters stand for the subjectivity of values! 4 Plato's own odd use of relative concepts, in postulating an unalloyed Large, Equal, Same, etc., which are not large, equal or same somethings, was not sophistical in the same way. Maybe he was postulating fictions, but at least he normally kept the relative and the supposed absolute cases conceptually distinct.</page><page sequence="25">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY M. A. Stewart and Rosamond Kent Sprague II-Rosamond Kent Sprague Plato's Use of Fallacy was written between 1954 and 1958. Thus, while its faults cannot quite be identified with the sins of my youth, they can at least be attributed to the onset of early middle age. I agree with one reviewer that I was per- haps too anxious to show "that Plato can do no wrong," and I certainly regret the incautious remark, seized upon with ill- disguised glee by others, that Plato possessed "a complete mastery of certain kinds of fallacy." On the other hand there are at least two main features of the book about which I am still impenitent. One of these is the importance of the Euthydemus as an invaluable aid to the interpretation of Plato. It continues to amaze me that serious students of Platonic arguments pay so little attention to this highly in- teresting dialogue. (In recent discussions of false statement in the Sophist and of the arguments in the first part of the Parmenides, the Euthydemus is conspicuous only by its ab- sence.) If I did not continue to believe in the importance of this dialogue, I would not have consented to present myself for dismemberment by wild philosophers. The other main feature of the book that I would still wish to defend is somewhat more difficult to express, but as I think that the chief difference between myself and Dr. Stewart lies here, I shall make the attempt. I see myself as having written the book in the belief, not only that Plato wrote dialogues, but that Plato's dialogues are written by Plato. Let me explain. Stewart has raised the question as to what stage Plato represents in the evolution from "the ability to distinguish in a rough and ready way between what does and what does not carry conviction" to the "theorizing stage" (represented by Aristotle) "in which general features in argu- ment types" are identified. As I see it, there is one sense in which Plato can hardly be said to represent any stage in this evolution, because he was not aiming at the same end; he was not trying to write treatises on logic, he was trying, by means</page><page sequence="26">46 II-ROSAMOND KENT SPRAGUE of the dialogue form, to incite his readers to work out logical principles for themselves. Thus I remain totally unmoved when Stewart says "there is even less basis for thinking that the bad arguments were put there knowingly to tease us, since the plain fact is that that is not the usual reason why good philosophers have put forward bad arguments." No, it is certainly not the usual reason, but it could well be the reason of a good philosopher doing philosophy in an unusual way. The remark that Plato's dialogues were written by Plato also calls for some explanation. I tend to think that those of us who study the dialogues sometimes fail to realize what it would be like to write one, how necessary it would be, for in- stance, to hold the reins in our own hands. The situation is further complicated by our very natural tendency to think of one particular character (usually Socrates) as Plato's mouth- piece, and other characters, if they oppose the mouth-piece character, as being somehow other-than, not, or even anti-, Plato. A most beautiful example of this confusion occurs in Jowett's introduction to the Philebus (4th edition, Oxford, 1953, vol. III, p. 541): [Plato] will allow of no distinction between the plea- sures and the erroneous opinions on which they are founded, whether arising out of the illusion of distance or not. But to this we naturally reply with Protarchus, that the pleasure is what it is, although the calculation may be false, or the after-effects painful. It is difficult to acquit Plato, to use his own language, of being a 'tyro in dialectics', when he overlooks such a distinction. (My italics.) Perhaps this might be called the Fallacy of Misplaced Credit -which I shall not abbreviate to FMC for fear of disturbing the no doubt active shade of the late Professor Ryle, and for other obvious Platonic reasons. Another fine example of the Fallacy occurs in Stewart's paper: Since explicit comment in the [Euthydemus] is mini- mal (the sophistries being for the most part merely ex- pounded), we must assume either that to expound is to expose, or that Plato is exposing very few sophistries; and if to expound is to expose, then since it is the sophists</page><page sequence="27">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 47 who incur Plato's censure for expounding them, the exposure is no credit to him. (Italics mine.) If, in the last sentence, we omit the notion of censure (which appears irrelevant at the moment), Stewart is saying "if to expound is to expose, then since it is the sophists who ex- pound the sophistries, the exposure is no credit to Plato." To whom then? Presumably to Euthydemus and Dionysodorus. But to these as characters whose speeches are composed by Plato? Or do we have here a Rylean eristic moot, in which Plato merely takes notes? I think that Stewart, who in any case inclines more to the view that "Plato is exposing very few sophistries" (the point about censure could have been raised here), has not really thought out either the implications of the dialogue form or of the fact that Plato is the actual author of the Euthydemus. If he had, his estimate of Plato's contribution to the subject of sophistry might well have been higher. What I propose to do in this paper is, first, to emphasize the contrast between Plato and Aristotle by looking briefly at a convenient passage in On Sophistical Refutations in which Aristotle cites one of the Euthydemus arguments; second, to consider, in the eristic scenes of Euthydemus, the variety of ways in which Plato shows (as I think) his consciousness of sophistry; and third, to try to say something in answer to Stewart's comments on the arguments of the Socratic scenes. I At On Sophistical Refutations 165b25 Aristotle writes as follows: The methods of producing false illusion in connexion with language are six in number: equivocation, am- biguity, combination, division, accent and form of expres- sion. . ... Arguments such as the following are based on equivocation (hombnumia): 'Those who know, learn; for it is those who know the use of letters that learn what is dictated to them.' Here 'learn' (to manthanein) is equivocal, meaning 'understand by using knowledge' (sunienai) and 'acquire knowledge' (lambanein). (Trans. Forster, and so elsewhere.)</page><page sequence="28">48 II-ROSAMOND KENT SPRAGUE A version of this same argument occurs also at Euthydemus 276C: Well then, Cleinias [said Dionysodorus], when the writing master gave you dictation, which of the boys learned the piece, the wise or the ignorant? The wise, said Cleinias. Then it is the wise who learn, and not the ignorant, and you gave Euthydemus a wrong answer just now. This passage occurs in the first round of eristic arguments and is a member of the group receiving "explicit comment" from Socrates at 277E ff. Socrates says to Cleinias: In the first place, as Prodicus says, you must learn about the correct use of words; and our two visitors are pointing out this very thing, that you did not realize that people use the word "learn" (to manthanein) not only in the situation in which a person who has no knowledge of a thing in the beginning acquires it (lambandi) later, but also when he who has this knowledge already uses it to inspect the same thing, whether this is something spoken or something done. (As a matter of fact, people call the latter "understand" [suntenai] rather than "learn", but they do sometimes call it "learn" as well.) Now this, as they are pointing out, had escaped your notice-that the same word is applied to opposite sorts of men, to both the man who knows and the man who does not. My purpose in bringing these passages together is to reinforce the point made earlier that the methods of Plato and Aristotle are fundamentally different and that it therefore may not be appropriate to treat the Euthydemus, or indeed any other Platonic dialogue, as a step towards Aristotelian theorization. Aristotle shows himself to be quite aware of this fundamental difference when, at the end of On Sophistical Refutations, 184bi, he makes the surprising statement that "regarding reasoning we had absolutely no earlier work to quote." In view of the fact that quite a large number of his examples have been drawn from the Euthydemus (or at least from a common sophistic stock) and that, as we can see from the pas-</page><page sequence="29">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 49 sages just cited, he even gives the same analysis of one argu- ment as does Plato, it is clear that he must regard his own contribution as something distinctively different. If we ask what this contribution is, it must be one of classification and naming. Aristotle has made an initial division of sophistical refutations into those para tin lexin (in dictione) and those ex5 tis lexeds (extra dictionem) (165b23). He now sub-divides para tin lexin into six, and gives the name hom6numia (equivocation) to the group that includes the argument appearing also at Euthydemus 276C. In treating this general topic elsewhere (Personalist, 1967) I argued that there was nothing peculiar to the dialogue form to prevent Plato from classifying and naming sophistical arguments had he wished to do so. To illustrate this point I invented a piece of Socratic conversation, as follows: Socrates to Cleinias [after the sophists have given several example of arguments based on equivocation, ending with the one about "learn"] Was it not the double meaning of "learn" which caused you to give the sophist a wrong answer just now, Cleinias? Cleinias Yes, indeed, Socrates. Socrates And was not something like this the case with all the other arguments? Cleinias Yes, it was, Socrates, if I remember rightly. Socrates Then shall we put all these arguments to- gether and say that they have a family resemblance? Cleinias Why not, Socrates? Socrates And since they belong to the same family, shall we not call them by a family name? Cleinias What one? Socrates We might call them double-minded or equivocal arguments. Cleinias Yes, we might do that. I am quite aware that others (Richard Robinson in particular) would wish to argue that absence of the name means absence of the thought, and I have, of course, no way of demonstrating to the unbeliever that Plato had thoughts that he does not name. I think, however, that the absence of a name in Plato is much less significant than it would be in Aristotle. For Plato,</page><page sequence="30">50 II-ROSAMOND KENT SPRAGUE the nature of the elenchus discourages the handing over of ready-made thoughts, and, further, he shows a general ten- dency to disparage the use of technical terminology. (See, e.g., on poiotes at Theaetetus 182A, and 184C where too much linguistic precision is characterized as ungentlemanly! Charmides 163D and Protagoras 358B are also relevant.) It seems a bit difficult, also, to deny classification of particular instances to a thinker who so often encourages the search for the common eidos (as say, at Meno 72C), and appears to have been the architect of a theory which could be said to embody the results of such investigations. I find it interesting also that a pupil of Aristotle, Eudemus, is quoted by Simplicius (Phys. I, 3, 12o, 6-10o) as taking the same attitude to Plato with respect to Parmenides as later writers have taken to Aristotle with respect to Plato: Ought we to be surprised if Parmenides was led astray by worthless arguments and was deceived by such things when at that time they had not yet been cleared up? Because nobody talked about equivocation (to pollach6s), Plato being the first to introduce "the double sense" (to disson), nor about the essential and the accidental, but [Parmenides] appears to have been confused on these points. [I owe the reference to E. Poste, Aristotle on Fallacies, London, 1866, p. 175.] That Eudemus, who must have known that Plato was not writing treatises in the Aristotelian manner, should speak of Plato as he does, suggests that the Aristotelian treatise was not, in his view, the only way of conveying logical reflections. II In this section I propose to take up various ways in which Plato, in the eristic scenes in the Euthydemus, shows himself conscious that the sophistries are sophistries, and also appears in some cases to indicate the points of difficulty. Aristotle writes (and I would agree) that "it is possible for a man to show that a false conclusion has been reached without showing on what point it turns" (On Sophistical Refutations 179b17). I think, however, that Plato's methods of showing such points are more various than Stewart has suggested.</page><page sequence="31">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 51 A. Explicit comment The passage that can most reasonably be placed here is the one at 277E ff. already quoted; on this point Stewart and I would agree. I would disagree with him on several points of interpretation, however. 1. He appears to take an Eleatic approach to the manthanontes /sophoi-amatheis arguments. That is, he tries out (and rejects) the hypothesis that manthanein is ambiguous and the others not. He then reverses the procedure and says that the sophoi-amatheis ambiguities, if granted, make the manthanein ambiguity redundant. I would argue that the two ambiguities work together. There would be no point, for the sophists, in asking the question, "who learns, the sophoi or the amatheis?" if it were possible to give an unequivocal answer. And the reason it is not possible is that the ambiguity in manthanein can be played upon to bring out the sophoi- amatheis ambiguity. The interdependendence of the two am- biguities may be seen more readily if we imagine the initial question to be something like "who learns, the hot or the cold?" The refutations of Cleinias could not then be brought off because the question does not lead to a situation in which those who know are opposed to those who do not know (see 278A). Aristotle appears to be thinking along these general lines when he says (On Sophistical Refutations 175b39 ff.): "If one does not make two questions into one, the fallacy which depends on equivocation and ambiguity would not exist either, but either refutation or absence of refutation." In other words, when Cleinias is asked, "who learns, the sophoi or the amatheis?" he is really being treated to a fallacia plurium interrogationum the question is, in fact, "who are the knowers/not knowers, the knowers/not knowers or the knowers/ not knowers?" 2. Stewart has what is to me a very strange idea that the sophoi/amatheis ambiguities are "real" or "subtle," and that the manthanein ambiguity is "unreal" or "childish." (It may be that he thinks this because Socrates gives an analysis of the latter but not of the former; the one that escapes him is there- fore subtle, and the one that does not is, perhaps in view of the remarks about frivolity 278B, childish.) Because of what I have just said about the interdependence of the two</page><page sequence="32">52 II-ROSAMOND KENT SPRAGUE ambiguities, I cannot accept such a distinction. Both am- biguities seem to me equally subtle and equally real, and I certainly do not see the two senses of manthanein as analogous to the two specified senses of the English word "game". Manthanein is one of those words with which, in the language of the Phaedrus (261E, and cf. 263AB), there is more chance of deception because the difference in the senses is small rather than great. It might be added, too, that, in terms of Plato's general philosophy, "learn" is one of the most impor- tant words to get right, since the theory of Forms presents us with a situation in which we "learn" what we know already. 3. Stewart deduces from the "explicit comment" passage that Socrates "is not trying to bring out any ambiguities". He arrives at this conclusion from the following train of reason- ing: "It is said twice, at 277e and 278a, that the sophists by their antics aim to bring out the alleged ambiguity. Socrates dissociates himself from this aim, belittling it; so he is not trying to bring out any ambiguities." He then goes on to say that "because Socrates does grudgingly try to explain one of them most critics conclude that it was one of Plato's purposes in the dialogue to expose the ambiguities and other sophistic knacks and the sophists' aim to hide them. This is to stand the text on its head." (Then follows the passage about ex- pounding and exposing commented on earlier.) My difficulty here is that Stewart seems to be turning a deaf ear to Socratic irony. The last thing the sophists are trying to do is to reveal the mechanics of their arguments, for the simple reason that to reveal them is a reveal also the fact that their refutations of Cleinias are apparent rather than real. Nor does Socrates "dissociate himself from this aim"; the bringing out is his, not theirs, and I should say that it is ungrudgingly rather than grudgingly done. What he does dissociate himself from is the sophists' treatment of Cleinias. Stewart has in fact mis- read the text at an important point: the tauta of 278B2 and of C2 refers to the trick arguments (it is these that are described as "frivolity"), not to Socrates' analysis of them. Thus a reference to, for instance, Plato's "claim that the study of [the ambiguity of manthanein] is only fit for party pranks" (my italics) is misconceived. This initial misreading has far-reach- ing consequences since it issues in such remarks as "Plato's</page><page sequence="33">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 53 own point ... is that [knowledge of ambiguity] is knowledge that of its nature has no serious use," and even that Plato had "a wish not to know about ambiguity"l B. Expounding (I use Stewart's word, although I would really prefer to speak of "committing" rather than "expounding" a fallacy.) It is certainly true, as Stewart and I agree, that the Euthydemus contains more commission than comment, but the comment can be implicit as well as explicit. Stewart recog- nizes this in his remarks about table-turning in Round 3 and to some extent also in what he says about Plato's grouping of arguments into sets. I want to call attention to a few more points of this kind: cases, that is, in which the commission of fallacies succeeds in producing implicit comment. 1. Consider once more the sophists' initial question to Cleinias at 275D, "who learns, the sophoi or the amatheis?" At 276A Cleinias answers this question by sophoi. Then at 276B he is manoeuvred into changing his anwser to amatheis and at 276C into changing it back to sophoi. This procedure seems to me designed by Plato to induce, in the reader, re- flections like the following: if Cleinias is forced into giving, the third time, the answer he gave the first time, has he really been refuted? and if he can be made to give opposite answers to the same question, was the question really the same one? What about the means by which these shifts have been accom- plished-is learning the lyre a different kind of "learning" from learning what is dictated, for instance? In other words, a juxtaposition of arguments causes reflection that might not have been produced by single arguments. Plato no doubt also wants to induce reflection on more general points: how is such a procedure helping Cleinias to become virtuous? are the sophists interested in "how matters stand" (278B) if they are willing to shift positions along with Cleinias? and so forth. 2. Arguments issuing in conclusions that are a strong affront to common sense may induce censure and consequent reflec- tion even when simply expounded and not analysed. The ar- guments of Round 2 are mostly of this type. (Juxtaposition and series are not now essential, as they were in Round 1.) In</page><page sequence="34">54 II-ROSAMOND KENT SPRAGUE Round 2 we have the following conclusions: those who wish for a loved person's improvement really desire his death, it is impossible to tell lies, and it is impossible to contradict. (All of these conclusions are vigorously resisted by Ctesippus, who expresses the reader's reactions by functioning as a kind of chorus character here.) In writing on the arguments of this round, Stewart twice concludes that Plato, even if he felt the distinctions necessary for the analysis of the arguments, "had no apparatus for describing them." I think I would want to rephrase this slightly, to say something like "employed no apparatus to describe them." That is, I would wish to allow for the possibility that it is Plato's conception of how philosophy should be done that accounts for the lack of techni- cal terminology here, rather than an inability to say what Aristotle might have said. C. Gun-spiking The best example occurs in Round 3, and is recognized by Stewart when he says that "Socrates and his friends . . . several times trzr to turn the tables on the sophists, which presupposes some grasp of what is going on." The sophists have in mind to demonstrate to Socrates that he possesses the knowledge (the basilike techne) for which he and Cleinias have just been vainly searching (2g3B). Their strategy is to get from Socrates the admission that he knows some particular thing and then to make an illegitimate move from knowing x to knowing absolutely. (If he is all-knowing, he must of course know the knowledge for which he was searching.) When Socrates objects that there are other things he does not know, the sophists make a companion move (from not-knowing x to absolute not-knowing) and point out that he cannot be both knowing and not-knowing "at the same time and [which is of course not the case] in respect to the same things" eg3CD. Socrates' reaction to this argument comes so close to "explicit comment" that it might almost be grouped with 277E ff.: But how do I know that knowledge we were looking for? Since it is impossible both to be and not to be the same thing, if I know one thing I know absolutely everzr-</page><page sequence="35">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 55 thing-because I could not be both knowing and not knowing at the same time-and since I know everything, I also have this knowledge. Is this what you mean, and is this your piece of wisdom? (293D) However, he does other things besides summarize sophistic procedure: he tries to resist the illegitimate moves from knowing/not-knowing x to knowing/not-knowing absolutely by continuing to retain the qualifying phrases the sophists wish to remove. So, for instance, when Euthydemus says (293C) "Then you are knowing, if you really know?", Socrates answers "Of course, so far as concerns that particular thing", and to Euthydemus' assertion "Then if there is anything you don't know, you are not knowing," he replies "In just that matter, my friend." A little later, when Euthydemus wants to bring off an argument to show that Socrates is not only know- ing but always knowing (295Bff.), gun-spiking continues and from Euthydemus' angry responses (e.g., 295B, 296A, B) we find out that it is again Socrates' retention of qualifying phrases that obstructs the illegitimate moves. The passage also contains what might be called some "meta-sophistical" re- marks at 295BC. Socrates has been reprimanded for asking a question of his own instead of answering the one posed by Euthydemus at 295B5. His response is to say, Very well, but how am I to act? .. . whenever I don't understand your question, do you want me to answer just the same, without inquiring further about it? and, he continues, . . . if you ask a question with one thing in mind, and I understand it with another and then answer in terms of the latter, will you be satisfied if I answer nothing to the purpose? After an insulting reply from the sophist, Socrates comments to the listening Crito, I realized that he was angry with me for making dis- tinctions in his phrases, because he wanted to surround me with words and so hunt me down (295D).</page><page sequence="36">56 II-ROSAMOND KENT SPRAGUE Plato is giving, in this part of the dialogue, a dramatic repre- sentation of the debating advice later given by Aristotle at On Sophistical Refutations 175b28: ... if one does not distinguish the meanings of a doubtful term, it is not clear whether he has been confuted or not, and since the right to draw distinctions is conceded in arguments, it is obvious that to grant the question simply, without making distinctions, is a mistake ... I should say therefore that the gun-spiking tactics allowed to Socrates in Round 3 are an effective way of revealing the mechanics of the sophist's arguments, and further, that they lead naturally to comments by Socrates which find their counterpart in the more obviously self-conscious reflections of Aristotle. D) Imitation When the sophists have finished their demonstration (to universal applause), they receive the heavily ironic compli- ments of Socrates. Among these is the following: But the greatest thing of all is that your skill is such, and is so skilfully contrived, that anyone can master it in a very short time. I myself found this out by watching Ctesippus and seeing how quickly he was able to imitate you on the spur of the moment. Plato evidently regards this ease of imitation as a point against the sophists and refers to it frequently. We have hardly been introduced to Euthydemus and Dionysodorus before we discover that they have themselves acquired the eristic art in a short time and at an advanced age (272AC), and there have been numerous opportunities in the course of the dialogue to observe the phenomenon, commented upon by Socrates, of the ease with which eristic techniques are picked up by the not unusually gifted Ctesippus. (Cf. 284E, 298B, 299E, and the successful attack conducted at 300 CD.) At 301 B, Socrates himself, again with heavy irony, remarks "I was so eager to have the wisdom of the pair that I was already trying to copy it." It will pay us to look at some one of these examples more</page><page sequence="37">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 57 closely, say 298B. Ctesippus has just heard an exchange be- tween Socrates and Dionysodorus in which the sophist has argued that Chaeredemus, the father of Socrates' half-brother, Patrocles, is not a father at all since he is other than Socrates own father, Sophroniscus: Because if Chaeredemus is a father, said Euthydemus, interrupting, then, on the other hand, Sophroniscus, being other than a father, is not a father, so that you, Socrates, are without a father. (298B) It is here that Ctesippus breaks in, saying to Euthydemus, "Well, isn't your father in just the same situation? Isn't he other than my father?" He has grasped that the way to ques- tion paternity (with not the politest implications for the ladies concerned) is to make a sophistic slide from "other than" to "not", with an accompanying slide from "my" to "a". (I might register here my surprise at the neglect of this passage in con- nexion with Sophist 256Dff.) By letting us see that Ctesippus understands how to con- struct this type of sophistical argument, Plato is giving us a lesson in how to do it ourselves. His lessons are not as overt as Aristotle's (at say On Sophistical Refutations XII-XV), but they are cogent illustrations of the fact that, as Socrates says at 3o4A, the sophists would be well advised not to talk in front of a large group; the listeners are likely to master it right away and give you no credit. Better just talk to each other in private, or, if you must have an audience, then let no one come unless he gives you money. Stewart and I would presumably disagree as to whether an ability to imitate sophistical arguments (which often means changing their terminology as Plato has Ctesippus do at, for instance, 299E and 3ooC) implies an understanding of the logical principles involved. I would certainly put the proba- bilities higher than he does, mainly, perhaps, because I tend to attach more importance than he appears to do to the in- genuity required to write the Euthydemus, and because I see Plato's methods as substantially different from Aristotle's.</page><page sequence="38">58 II--ROSAMOND KENT SPRAGUE III My third task is to make some response to Stewart's comments on the Socratic scenes. He begins by saying that my remark that Plato, by alternating eristic with protreptic scenes, was "forcing a comparison" between eristic and Socratic methods prompts the question "methods of what?" Although he has himself suggested what would be my answer (methods of education), he does not suggest that it might be mine. Instead he argues against the idea of comparison by saying that "the two parties are not really working in the same territory." He should make it clear, however, that this is what Plato con- sistently represents them as doing, and should not try to side- step the issue by adding, "setting aside Plato's ironic pretence" (i.e., that the two parties really are working in the same terri- tory.) Platonic irony is never safely set aside; to do so here has the effect of removing the point of Plato's anti-sophist polemic. Plato regards Euthydemus and Dionysodorus as dangerous precisely because they declare themselves to be in the business of purveying virtue (273D) and are thus setting themselves up as rivals to Socrates. His method of exploding this claim is to have Socrates encourage them in it to such an extent that it becomes patently ridiculous. Irony is his means of encourage- ment, and it is kept up throughout nearly the entire dialogue, e.g., 271Cff., 273Cff., 278C, D, 282Dff., 288BC, 293A, 294A, 295A, DE, 296E, 3ooD, 3o01E, with a culmination at 3o3Aff., part of which has already been quoted. But although the "ironic pretence" is sustained at such length (Socrates, as late as 304B, still speaks of his intention to take lessons in eristic), there is (and here Stewart and I are in at least partial agreement) a basic difference betwen the argu- ments of the two types of scene. The sophists may claim that their purpose is to teach virtue, but their actual aim is victory. This point comes out clearly if we look at Socrates' reply to Crito's early question, "what is their particular wis- dom?" 271C. He answers, "fighting in arguments and in refut- ing whatever may be said, no matter whether it is true or false" 272AB. In other words, what the sophists say their wis- dom is (273D) is not what Socrates says it is. And what Socrates says it is must surely be decisive here if we want to form an opinion as to Plato's opinion of sophistic procedure.</page><page sequence="39">PLATO'S SOPHISTRY 59 The main point Stewart wishes to make, however, is that we are not entitled to say that Plato "was pointing a com- parison between. . . 'good and bad logic', which implies that boundaries are being drawn on the basis of a grasp of certain general or generalizable principles." If Stewart means, which he does not precisely say, that the protreptic scenes fail to suggest such principles, he is certainly correct. (Interestingly enough, it is the sophistic scenes, with their constant invita- tion to us to examine the arguments, that do this.) However, he appears to be taking a different line: that the protreptic arguments are just as bad if not worse than the eristic ones, and therefore-but here I am not quite clear as to his conclu- sion. His use of Phaedo 9oB suggests that he may be thinking that even if Plato were to make clear that he believes there to be a distinction between good and bad logic, his failure to recognize the distinction in practice has the effect of nullifying it. As applied to the Euthydemus, this would be a rather un- satisfactory approach, since it would lead to the position that if Plato cannot recognize the badness of the protreptic argu- ments, he cannot recognize that of the eristic ones either. Stewart does not seem to want to occupy this position, since although his estimation of Plato's grasp of logical principles in the eristic scenes is much lower than mine, he shows few signs of thinking that Plato admired any of the eristic arguments. Stewart's comments have, however, caused me to think a bit more carefully about the nature of the protreptic argu- ments. One thing I think I see more clearly is that protreptic arguments, being decisional in their intent, are rather more like practical syllogisms (or practical inductions) than I had supposed. So for instance, at the end of the first protreptic scene, 282D, Socrates says to Cleinias Now then, since you believe both that [wisdom] can be taught and that it is the only existing thing which makes a man happy and fortunate, surely you would agree that it is necessary to love wisdom and you mean to do this yourself (my italics). and Cleinias answers, "This is just what I mean to do Socrates, as well as ever I can." Stewart is of course quite right to point out that the argument leading to Cleinias' decision includes</page><page sequence="40">60 II-ROSAMOND KENT SPRAGUE both active and passive senses of eutukh s and that the term is, strictly speaking equivocal. The equivocation is, however, benign rather than malignant. I mean something like this: even if the equivocation is made explicit, there is no need to alter the conclusion that wisdom should be loved. We might say, "Look here, Socrates, you've pushed Cleinias to this con- clusion by mixing up examples in which the wise practitioner is lucky (e.g., flute-playing) with examples in which the person entrusting himself to the expert is lucky (e.g., sailing with a wise pilot)" and he might answer, "All right, I see what you mean, and if you like I will set out two arguments, one active and one passive. They do in fact lead to the same conclusion (which is why I didn't trouble to make the distinction clear) but I can see that my procedure was a bit sloppy." The reason why Socrates can afford to be sloppy (and why I have called the equivocation "benign") is that there is a basic core to the argument which is not sloppy. It might be formulated as follows: Everything that leads to prosperity should be chosen Wisdom leads to prosperity Wisdom should be chosen. The argument is obviously quite general, and allows for a variety of cases of "things leading to prosperity," but it is a perfectly valid argument. The equivocations of Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, how- ever, their purpose being to refute, have always the effect not of strengthening but of reversing conclusions. (We have seen, for instance, how the manthanein ambiguity causes Cleinias to shift from sophoi to its opposite amatheis and back again.) Furthermore, since the victory aimed at is a verbal victory (the sophists are not exhorting Cleinias to choose anything except a form of words), the eristic arguments have to be phrased with much greater precision than the protreptic ones. So, for instance, the argument about omniscience at 293B has to force its way through the gun-spiking additions made by Socrates if it is to reach the conclusion "you always know," and later, at 297B, Euthydemus has to pull up his brother for making a slip which may "ruin the argument".</page><page sequence="41">PLATO S SOPHISTRY 61 The second protreptic scene (the one discussed by Stewart as concerned with knowledge in general and success in general) is one I have treated at some length elsewhere (Plato's Philosopher-King, South Carolina, 1976, 48-56) so that I shall not attempt a full discussion of it here. The passage seems to me best understood as evidence of Plato's concern with the notion of a second-order techne and has parallels with Lysis (the first friend) and Charmides (a science of sciences). The demand for the first-order product of a second-order art is the kind of deliberately paradoxical question posed by Plato in connexion with the general problem of the nature of the stateman's art, and is intended by him to indicate that the statesman must (in the language of the Charmides) "know in a sort of way things he does not know at all" 17sC. I have no space left (nor indeed do I think I have the philosophical competence) to deal with Stewart's comments in II and III. It might be worthwhile in conclusion, however, to draw attention to the fact that ambiguity was a general feature of Greek literature and not the special invention of philoso- phers. I quote from the beginning and end of the fascinating study by W. B. Stanford (Ambiguity in Greek Literature, Oxford, 1939): It was, and perhaps still is, a common misapprehension that the more ingenious uses of verbal ambiguity were a pernicious product of fifth-century sophistry.... The sophists merely perverted to argumentative ends what the poets had been always justiSably using for achieving in- tensity and brevity of expression or complexity of situa- tion, or for pleasing, interesting, moving their hearers. (pp. 1 and 182) In other words, Plato was nourished on a tradition rich in the exploitation of verbal ambiguities and did not need to wait for Aristotle to point them out.</page></plain_text>
