<plain_text><page sequence="1">Classical Mythology. By MARK P. O. MORFORD and ROBERT J. LENARDON. New York: David McKay, 1971. Professors Morford and Lenardon have designed the perfect handbook for undergraduates studying classical mythology. Just what I was searching for when I planned my own syllabus. Of course, handbooks which para- phrase Greek and Roman myths abound, but, now that courses in mythology attract students who are not interested in the languages, classicists can keep their discipline alive by introducing the best literary versions of the myths rather than summaries for memorization or scientific analysis. Classical Mythology enables the professor to present the myths at their most readable without requiring an expensive booklist or daily assignments from the library reserve shelf. The authors of Classical Mythology have translated large continuous passages from the "one ancient treatment that has been most influential in establishing the prototype for all subsequent art and thought" (Intro., p. 6). Important myths about the gods are related through generous selections from Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Ovid, whereas several complete scenes from the Bacchae are included in the discussion of Dionysus. The</page><page sequence="2">80 OCTOBER-NOVEMBER, 1974 chapter entitled "Anthropomorphism and Greek Humanism" contains the entire story of Croesus, as told by Herodotus. Shorter passages from other authors are included where they are relevant. For example, after using Hesiod's Theogony for the birth of the Titans, Professor Lenardon focuses on the sun god and translates Mimnermus' Fragment 10 about the beautiful cup which carries Helius back to the East before dawn. Quotations from varied sources such as Xenophanes, Steisichorus, Bacchylides, Pindar, Plato, Cicero, Virgil, and Lucian introduce the students to the richness of classical literature while bringing the myths to life. The translations that Morford and Lenardon provide are clear and lively, the transitions between passages very smooth, and the passages themselves long enough to give the students a sense of the literary value. I, however, prefer to read certain works complete and in my favorite translation. The handbook fits in well with such a course plan. In dealing with the Theban cycle, the Trojan cycle, and other sagas and local legends, the authors have "resorted to paraphrase in the interests of conciseness and clarity" (p. vii). Therefore, without doubling the assignments, it is possible for the teacher to select separate plays and even numerous books from the Iliad, Odyssey and Aeneid and use the handbook to fill in the gaps for the students. The book is organized logically. The introduction presents the authors' definition and point of view about myth as a phenomenon, a discussion of some general approaches to myth, and a brief summary of Minoan-Myce- naean history and its relation to Greek myth. The account begins at the beginning, with creation, mainly from Hesiod, although other literary ver- sions are alluded to. As each divinity is introduced, all the major stories about him are collected and discussed together with numerous cross-refer- ences in the text to related stories or themes. The sections on the heroes are divided according to geographical centers for cycles and legends. Discussions of the survival of classical mythology are reserved for the end where separate chapters consider Roman myth, and the influence of the classics on Western art, literature, and opera. Instead of specific examples of the survival of each tale, Professor Morford offers a general historical survey. Bibliographi- cal notes refer the student to lists of poems, plays, and pictures that would be helpful for tracing the development of certain myths. The handbook is easy for the student to use. The authors furnish a select bibliography for the general reader in the back of the book, but they also provide explanatory notes and annotated bibliography for most topics at the bottom of the page, accessible at a glance. Moreover, there are numerous cross-references to related themes and figures within the text and also three separate indexes to help the student find the passage, person, or author he is looking for. Finally, the book contains a nice selection of black-and-white prints covering a wide range from Exekias' Dionysus calyx to a Nereid by George Braque. I might have wished for a more detailed discussion of approaches to myth and mythmaking, particularly in the areas of comparative myth, an- thropology, and psychology. In his introduction, however, Professor Lenar- don has anticipated my objection. He proposes to deal only with the most important and persistent theories on the meaning and interpretation of myth. After distinguishing between rational and metaphorical approaches and briefly discussing Freud and Frazer, he jusifies the exclusion of comparative mythology.</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 81 Parallels unquestionably do exist, but analogies are fraught with in- numerable deceptions for every single truth that they may divulge. It is a fact that prominent themes recur (often apparently quite inde- pendently) in the mythical thinking of widely divergent peoples and societies; the character and attributes of sky dieties are (of course?) strikingly similar; creation stories often contain identical episodes.... Yet, despite everything, a vast gulf separates the musings of the Zulus or Fiji Islanders and the sophisticated and sublime mythological thinking evolved by the Greeks and Romans. The realization of this difference is fundamental (pp. 4-5). His arguments are convincing and the authors' "personal and eclectic" choice includes the basic approaches. The notes to the introduction contain an excellent bibliography on mythical analysis and theory. Questions of religion and ritual are considered within the text and special chapters are devoted to discussions of anthropomorphism, humanism, and views of the afterlife. Relations between myth and history are especially well-treated. For example, the section on Theseus examines the rivalry between the Athenian hero and Heracles as well as the use of the Theseus story by the developing Athenian polis. Thus, Classical Mythology covers mythmaking and its functions in a way which should stimulate students to recognize the value and relevance of classical studies.
