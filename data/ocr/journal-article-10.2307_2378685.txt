N AN unforgettable sunny autumn day, thirty-seven years ago, I visited Oxford for the first time as a young graduate of another univer- sity, now in ruins, almost as old and equally famous but-as most universi- ties on the continent-without the au- tonomous, corporate, intellectual life of resident scholars which has survived in Oxford's picturesque old colleges, unin- terrupted from the Middle Ages. My host, a great European and famous his- torian, now departed, showed me around, starting our peripatos from a monument familiar to students at least as a place where buses stop and a telephone-box serves their convenience. But to me, a stranger new to Oxford, the whole tragic story commemorated by the Martyrs' Memorial was then told in moving words: "This," said my kind guide, "is not a red brick university of yesterday and to morrow. 'The place where thou standest is holy.' Here men have died for their convictions." I have never forgotten this introduction to the glories of Oxford. Many years afterwards I was shown in the wall of the Botanical Garden the He- brew inscription composed by the late Dr. Herbert Loewe commemorating the martyrdom of a Dominican who was burnt there on the stake as an apostate from his faith because he had embraced the Jewish religion. Walking back from this tablet to the Martyrs' Memorial I realized that brave and upright men were and are willing to die for convictions which are incompatible, that is to say, which cannot both be true, although they both may quite conceivably be errone- ous. "A thing," said Oscar Wilde forty years ago, "is not necessarily true be- cause a man dies for it." Now I am prob- ably wrong to quote such a frivolous jester in such a serious connection. Let me atone for it by quoting the passionate words which Oliver Cromwell wrote on the third of August, T650, to the General Assembly of Scotland: "I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken." Some years before these words were written the great French mathematician Rene Descartes who had to leave-as so many of us have had to do in the last decade-his beloved country of origin and to migrate to the land of the free in order to be able to say, write, and print in peace the fundamental words from which the history of modern philosophy is known to have started on a new course of magnificent achievement: "De omni- 77</page><page sequence="2">78 ETHICS bus dubitandum," "we must doubt every- thing," greatly daring, besought his readers to think it possible that every- body, past and present, including all our teachers and the whole tradition handed down by them may be mistaken and that we must start again to think for our- selves. Nothing is more important to know than this old adage: "Noli iurare in verbal magistri" "do not swear by the word of your teacher" however learned, eloquent and worthy of your respect and affection he or she may be. I beseech you, think it possible, they may be mistaken, everybody may be mistaken. De omnibus dubitandum-we must doubt, dub-itare, "be in two minds" about everything: it may be true, it may be false. If you accept this basic dualism, as you must, and start from this Cartesian skepticism as the Archimedean stand- point, the fulcrum from which you can lever up the whole world of tradition, you will see immediately that absolute skepticism, which is absolute nihilism, refutes itself. If I say, "Everything is un- certain, nothing is certainly true," at least this first proposition must be cer- tainly true. For if it were not true that "everything is uncertain," the contrary must surely be true: some things or at least "some thing," in the singular, "must be true." If you think at all, you must admit that there is certainty and truth in con- tradistinction to uncertainty and down- right error. These basic words "if you think at all" lead you directly to the fundamental Cartesian certainty axiom: the existence of thought itself-or call it doubt to begin with, if you want to be particularly careful-cannot be denied and must be taken for granted. It is at this point, however, that we must part company with Descartes who took the "cogito," "I think," as the ultimate cer- tainty upon which we can build every- thing else. Experience has shown and shows again and again that if you start from this "cogito," "I think," you get in- evitably, sooner or later, into the blind alley of absurdity represented by the as- sertions that "my thoughts" and "my self" are the only certain and immediate- ly evident realities while "you," "all of you," and all your thoughts may con- ceivably be nothing but my own dreams and illusions and that I can never be sure of communication with your thoughts. The absurdity of this theory known as "sol-ips-ism"-taught by my own first teacher of philosophy, Adolph von Le- clair, one of the two only solipsists men- tioned in comprehensive histories of modern philosophy-becomes patent if you remember that we can only think in terms of some language, some signaling system, acoustic, optic, or hepatic like Braille script, and that no language is quite private, exclusively my own lan- guage. Language and therefore thought are always "our language," primarily my and my mother's language, i.e., our mother-tongue. It is always, indeed by definition, a means of communication, always a conveyance of "our thought," even if I talk to myself when writing alone in my study or rehearsing a lecture for the students. Cogitatmus, we think, not cogito, I think, is our inevitable, axiomatic, start- ing point. Cogitatmus, i.e., co-agitamus, we put assiduously together, we pool, we communicate and co-ordinate our ex- periences, we think. If you do not accept this as true, if you think it possible that we, all of us, may be dreaming or hallu- cinating together, there is an absolute deadlock. I cannot talk any more to you, you cannot talk to me, any more than you or I can talk with our pet horses, dogs, or cats, much as we would like to</page><page sequence="3">THE EMPIRIC BASIS OF MORAL OBLIGATION 79 and actually never cease trying. No philosophy of nihilism can be built on the negation of all certain truth, or even on the quicksand of Pontius Pilate's skepti- cism, asking whether there is such a thing as truth. Cogitamus expresses the basic experience that I do not find my ego, that the self never finds itself quite alone in the world. I have learned as every child learns to think, to speak the mother tongue in my fatherland from a mother or foster-mother or nurse or father. Lan- guage and thought are social, they are kinship facts, not individual achieve- ments. What happens to a - human being brought up without contact with a speech community can now be learned from the well-documented book by Dr. Arnold Gesell of Yale University, Wolf Child and Human Child: The Life History of Kama- la, the Wolf Girl.' Far from developing into counterparts of the incomparable Mowgli in Kipling's Jungle Book, such children-a number of which have been observed less intimately by reliable witnesses-grow up into piti- fully feeble-minded, truly feral beings. There is no thinking ego divorced from the thoughts we think and the language we speak. This inescapable experience: cogita- mus, we think, leads us inevitably to recognize that truth and error too are only experienced in the we-form of this basic plural. The individual can never be certain whether he is awake or dreaming, right or wrong in his assumptions, for dreams are private and inescapably indi- vidual, while-as Heraclitus of Ephesus first saw and said: ho logos xynos. The word, the thought, reason itself; the Greek language has most significantly I Based on the Diary Account of a child reared by a wolf and who then lived for nine years in the orphanage of Midnapore in the province of Bengal. London: Methuen, I94I. only one word for these three concepts. The word, the thought are common and yet people do act as if they each had a thought or word (logos) of their own. The fundamental notion of truth and error- Wahrheit und Irrtum, the title of a fa- mous book by my late teacher Ernst Mach-is nothing but the abbreviated distinction of our every day's and every night's overwhelming experience, of the implacable opposition between the daily experiences we share and the nightly il- lusions, terrors, or wish fulfilments which are everyone's, every ego's strictly pri- vate dreams. (They may be his or her daydreams, since so many people con- tinue the chaotic imaginations of their nights into their disorderly and asocially isolated days.) Again and again I dream in the dark of the night-and many of you, I am sure, dream the same: it is broad day- light and yet I can fly, soar aloft without effort to the sky, by merely moving my arms like birds' wings; I dream that this is quite an easy achievement and that everybody could do it, if only people knew and were not so silly as never to try it. But when I wake up-sometimes after a frightful Icarian fall into an abyss -I find that I am in the dark, earth- bound, and heavy in my bed and that I have been deceived by illusions de gran- deur, megalomania, and imaginary wish- fulfilment. While I dream I cannot know whether I am awake or dreaming. To pinch myself in order to find out which is the case is of no avail for I might dream that I pinch myself. Nor are apparent reason and logical coherence always missing from a dream. My teacher, the great Viennese physicist and philosopher Ernest Mach, dreamed that he saw his bedside candle burning under the water inside his bedside drinking glass with bubbles of carbon-dioxide rising from the</page><page sequence="4">8o ETHICS water and that he was working out a new ingenious theory to account for this paradoxical phenomenon. A man who is quite alone cannot know whether his thoughts are true or false. He propounds them in propositions to his fellow-men for them to approve as probable, to applaud as plausible, or to reject as improbable and implausible. The Platonic dialogue is the essential form of philosophical discussion or anal- ysis. It takes two or three or more to dis- cover the truth by verifying our observa- tions. The isolated individual can never be certain whether he is right or wrong, and not even whether he is sane and rea- sonable or insane and mad. We all know -just as well as we know that we dream by night-that on the margin of our so- cial organism there live those terrifying beings who have no social comprehen- sion any more and are confined within a wholly private dream world. You may take this from me who have been not indeed in a lunatic asylum but in the solitary confinement of the "black bunker" in a concentration camp for a time that seemed endless: the completely isolated individual hangs on precariously and only perilously to reason and sanity. His situation is so terrible that he cannot help feeling it must be unreal, a mere nightmare. Men, he feels, cannot be so cruel as to inflict this horror upon a fel- low creature. As soon as he comes to be- lieve that he must be dreaming, he is tempted to imagine some more pleasant situation as real and to reject the real one as a mere dream. Once he has done that and rejected the truth, his reason is gone. Some people can resist this temp- tation for a long time-reciting the mul- tiplication table helps; they can still re- cover contact with mankind after their liberation, but nobody can stand solitary confinement in the dark for an indefinite length of time without going mad. Whoever has gone through this experi- ence knows that the private dreamworld in the darkness of the night-called by Charles Dickens "the insanity of each day's sanity"-and the chaos of igno- rance and madness are, by definition, the terror of the unknown, the greatest threat to which we can be exposed. On the contrary, the light of clear, shared and communicable, true and reliable ex- perience in terms of what we call public or common space-time, probable, plaus- ible, and acceptable for any observer whatsoever, in other words truth and reason, Greek logos and nous, are and must be the summum bonum, the highest aim and purpose of our existence as ra- tional beings, the kith and kin of homo sapiens. This is self-evident. For if any- one denies it and puts forward something else-say, pleasure, love, or power-as more valuable than truth and knowledge, more precious, more worthy of our al- legiance, of being sought for at all costs, my answer is simply: Is this proposition true? How do you know it is? First of all the truth must be sought by exploring the validity of such a state- ment. One cannot know the summum bonum, the supreme aim of life without striving first to attain the truth in this supremely important matter as in every other problem that arises. To reject our duty to find out the truth and to pro- claim it at all cost is the unforgivable sin against the mind, against reason itself; unforgivable because the sacrifici- um intellectus demanded by unreasoning, undoubting acceptance of tradition, de- prives us ipso facto of our common share in truth, the summum bonum. There are of course any number of people, indeed a whole mob, who like to be deceived and who cultivate credulity</page><page sequence="5">THE EMPIRIC BASIS OF MORAL OBLIGATION or, to use William James's more flatter- ing term, the will to believe, which is so characteristic of all the varieties of oc- cultism. "Populus," said Cardinal Caraf- fa (I5I7-6i), "vult decipi: Decipiatur." People want to be deceived: Let them be deceived. A large part of the electorate wants to be bribed by promises impos- sible of fulfilment; it will elect to be gov- erned by politicians who promise a world better than the one that can be built with the sweat of the brow. I wonder whether some of you remem- ber that charming poem by Vivian Lara- more: "Talk to me tenderly, tell me lies; I am a woman and time flies." Those who want to be told lies, get of course what they are asking for. There are, no doubt, mere men too who say quite openly what the late Rev. H. Richard Laurie Sheppard-better known as Dick Shep- pard, the famous pacifist Rector of St. Martin's-in-the-Field and Dean of Can- terbury-otherwise a most kind and charming man, wrote quite late in life: "I would rather be intellectually dis- honest than risk hurting my father's feeling' 2 as if it would not have done his father, the Rev. Dr. Edgar Sheppard, Minor Canon of Windsor and Dean of the Royal Chapels of London, any amount of good to be faced with a son of unfailing intellectual honesty. There are, moreover, in our experience a number of people whose statements are often found misleading, because it is part of their habitual behavior pattern to induce us to err and to take advantage of our ignorance. Such are confidence men, tricksters, cardsharpers, sooth- sayers, astrologers, palmists, and similar 2 The Rev. R. Ellis Roberts in H. R. L. Sheppard's Life and Letters (London: Murray, I942) on p. 28 approves of this attitude because "for him charity was a part of truth rather than dependent on it"- whatever that may mean. gentry living by their wits. Others are found intellectually incapable of ob- serving patiently, sifting and interpret- ing their observations according to the rules that have been found conducive to the avoidance of error, such as the de- lightfully inept reporter ridiculed in the last scene of Bernard Shaw's Doctor's Dilemnma. We find such fools, or let us call them more charitably credulous and uncritical minds, always ready to believe things to be or like what they would wish them to be for their own comfort, con- solation, or satisfaction. If we are stu- dents, seekers, or to use a more modern world, research-workers, in the quest for truth and anxious to avoid error, we shall not seek the company and co-operation of such people. We shall keep them away from us by showing them quite frankly that we do not suffer fools gladly nor like to listen to those "fittest for to forge true-seeming lies."3 In other words, the fact that we take our stand on the axiomatic certainty of the fact cogitamus, we think, recognize truth as the summum bonum to be de- sired at all cost; the fact that we say to whoever wants to impress us with the authority of even the greatest names, Amicus mi/i Platon, amicus mi/i Socra- tes, magis amica veritas, does not prevent unthinking, unreasoning people (the Greeks would say the alogoi, who have not the logos and are therefore kin to ta aloga, the mere speechless animals) from preferring other things such as pleasure or power. I submit that it was an unfortunate day on which Thomas Henry Huxley "took thought and invented what he con- ceived to be the appropriate title of agnostics" for free thinkers determined to start their thinking from the radical posi- tion of Cartesian skepticism, doubting 3 Spenser, Fairy Queen, I, I, 38.</page><page sequence="6">82 ETHICS the whole of our traditional alleged knowledge. As I have tried to show, we are not agnostics who boast of knowing nothing while other people know not even that. We know with certainty that we doubt, dubitamus, that we are in two minds because there is the duality of dreaming and waking, wishful or fearful and dispassionate thinking, error and truth. Experience shows further that there are animals who have next to no speech or thought (the aloga of the Greeks) and therefore no concern for truth, although they too proceed by trial and error to preserve their lives in the particular maze surrounding them; that there are even among the species man of the animal realm countless individuals who are more or less unthinking, un- reasoning like animals and unconcerned with that which the thinking man, Iomo sapiens, must necessarily pursue at all cost as the summum bonum: to wit, truth. This knowledge provides the thinking, cogitantes, with a strict religion in the literal sense of the word, with a link that binds the seekers and lovers of truth, the philaletheis or philosophoi, closely and in- timately together into a world-wide com- munity, logion, anthropon, politeia, the world-wide res public eruditorum, the commonwealth, the true university of those willing to live and die for what they sincerely hold to be the truth. They do not indulge in anthropomorphism, do not personify Truth as a fair maiden at the bottom of a well with no clothes nuda veritas but looking at herself in a mirror. Otherwise their religion is closely akin to the Heraclitean and Philonian ideas ex- pressed in the beautiful elegy used as a prologue to the Fourth Gospel. "In the beginning" of our experience we too find the world-pervading Logos, the Reason "which illuminates all men" who accept it as the summum bonum. Those who personify it-regardless of whether such a personification can be true-use for the summum bonum, to which we know our lives to be wholly devoted, the name of God which we are careful not to pro- nounce in vain. We not only believe but know that the Logos, all the Reason in the world we know, is somehow bound up with the life and what we call the body, while Orientals call it even more crudely the flesh of mankind. In other words we know that the Logos, that Rea- son is-if one likes thus to express it- incarnated in mankind. All things, all ob- jects of thought are made real by the truth of the thoughts defining and de- scribing them; not anything can be real without the thoughts and statements concerning it being characterized by truth and rationality. We know that our very life is bound up with and conditioned by our knowledge of truth and that it is constantly en- dangered by chaotic error and dark ig- norance. We know that truth is the lead- ing light we must follow to have life and life more abundant in the world in which we endeavor to maintain our lives. But we also know that there are people who are indifferent or even hostile to truth and reason (in Heraclitean Greek, hostile to the Logos-the alogoi, "who know it not and receive it not" and pursue other ends). The author, now well identified, of this beautiful elegy looked back as we still do to this day, more than ever, on a world full of strife, hatred, and war. He believed and professed reasonably enough that the Logos was incarnated, that is em- bodied, in the one and only human being or "son of man" who had tried to teach men non-resistance to evil and had asked them to oppose with love the hatred of their enemies. But since this Heraclitean</page><page sequence="7">THE EMPIRIC BASIS OF MORAL OBLIGATION 83 also said that the Logos-Reason, Truth -is "the true light which lighteth every man" willing to receive it, we need not quarrel with this assertion, even if we make free to doubt and eventually to de- cline all that tradition has read into and added on to this statement. As cogitantes, as thinking and reason- able beings, our allegiance to truth and reason as the summum bonum to be pur- sued at all cost, to be lived and died for, provides Rationalists, as the adherents to the much abused i8th-century, philo- sophical Culte de la Raison may still both proudly and humbly call themselves, with a religion to which they can bind themselves. It shows us a shining star to which we can "hitch our wagon" and endows us with a reliable rule of life, with Horatian vitae praecepta beatae. It teaches scientists that the foremost duty of the research-worker is publica- tion, his most abject failure the withhold- ing or falsification of the results of his in- vestigations. The most outspoken sin- cerity about the ways and means that have led him to the discovery of new knowledge is demanded of him by the categoric imperative of his self-evident and indubitable conviction. He must re- sist at all costs-if need be as a martyr, a witness of the inviolable sanctity of Truth-"the intrusion of secrecy." In his presidential address to the Royal Society on the occasion of its 283d anniversary meeting, Sir Henry Dale declared that "scientists who sub- mitted to the dire necessity of secrecy during a war imposed upon us by ag- gressors using every device of violence and fraud must now be watchful against any easy assumption that this submis- sion would be continued into peace. Scientists must make it clear to the world that if national military secrecy were al- lowed progressively to encroach upon the freedom of science [preventing it from obeying its foremost duty to pub- lish fully the results of its research] a ter- rible, possibly a mortal wound would have been inflicted on the free spirt of science itself, to the immeasurable loss of what it stood ready to offer to a wiser world." I want to emphasize with Sir Henry Dale that scientists of all the world must stand together, determined to preserve the integrity of science against the on- slaught of the politician who prefers the blind strife for power to the clear-eyed search for truth, unhampered by any atavist prejudice handed down to us by our ancestors from the pre-logic age of unreason and nescience, as Professor Frederic Soddy calls it. Our principle of doubting everything forbids us to accept historic tradition without the most searching criticism of the available evidence. It obliges us to apply to the language form of ancient and contemporary thought the most searching attention. We have developed and are still perfecting formal logic, analytic and comparative grammar, and linguistic science as means to pursue our search for philological and historical truth and understanding, throughout the study of the so-called humanities. In science we feel obliged to discard as meaningless all that cannot be verified and all the unobservable elements. I need not describe what immense progress relativist physics has achieved through nothing but the elimination of unob- servables from its formulas; but it is interesting to note that Professor Milne of Wadham College, aided by Mr. Whit- row of Christchurch, has pursued this path even beyond Einstein and has succeeded in reducing the whole body of</page><page sequence="8">84 ETHICS physics to a single deductive kinematic cosmology.4 We also know as scientists that the world of physical reality we describe does not and cannot contain our private in- communicable experience, what Edding- ton called "the incommunicables." When I say that the color of a piece of paper is red, I cannot tell what I see when I see "red." All I can say-and that is enough for all of us-is that the color of this ob- ject is equal to the color we see at the short-wave end of the spectrum, or that if it is not pure spectral red, it is equal to a certain color determined by three monomarks in Ostwald's three-dimen- sional color-system or to color No. x in the Royal Horticultural Society's color- chart. In other words I convey merely an equation between two or more of my sensations. In this context the term equa- tion is nothing but a statement that I cannot observe a difference between the two sense-data in question. If I say that this colored paper is three inches long, that again is an equation between vari- ous indistinguishable (for us) spatial data. The whole world of physics is con- structed out of such purely negative statements of equality, that is of indis- tinguishability; it does not contain any of the underlying, exclusively private incommunicables such as color, sound, taste, smell, or touch-quality-although Eddington used to say smilingly that he personally could not help imagining elec- trons as red, neutrons as black. No more than colors, touch and tem- perature feelings, sounds, smells, and tastes does the world of physics, of inter- subjective reality, contain any such emo- tional qualities as each one of us per- ceives in most things. The world of 4 It is now accessible to the general student of science in Dr. Martin Johnson's little book Time, Knowledge and the Nebulae (Faber &amp; Faber, I945). physical reality contains no delightful and no frightful, no useful and no harm- ful things. Penicillin is as useful for man as it is harmful for bacteria. I myself have heard that great scholar, musician, and medical missionary, Dr. Albert Schweitzer, tell the amazed French Academie de Medecine that his conscience was troubled every time he used Atoxyl red to save the life of one black man suffering from sleeping sickness by tak- ing the lives of billions of micro-organ- isms, thus setting himself up as judge ex parne to determine the relative value of these various lives. The delight is not in the things them- selves that delight us, nor the frightful- ness in those that frighten us. All values are relative, "one man's meat is another man's poison." There are no beautiful things, "beauty is in the eye of the be- holder," non ones eadem mirantur amantque,5 and de gustibus non est dis- putandum. The whole history of art is just one continuous record of change in artists' aims and spectators' tastes, and no modern historian is any longer pre- pared to describe the transition from the Renaissance to the Baroque style, from Classicist to Romantic taste, from Im- pressionism to Expressionism, and all similar changes as a degeneration or aberration from a non-existent absolute ideal of beauty. Some audiences love waltzes and hate jazz; others adore jazz or swing and are bored by waltzes and polkas; some love classical, some prefer "low-brow" music. Caterers to the tastes of millions, like the B.B.C., have to di- vide the wave-lengths equitably between the two groups without being able com- pletely to satisfy either. Not even pleasure and pain in them- selves can be described, as the hedonists and Benthamist utilitarians were wont 5 Horace Epistles ii. 2. 58.</page><page sequence="9">THE EMPIRIC BASIS OF MORAL OBLIGATION 85 to do, as the absolute positive and nega- tive values we crave or avoid, because- as Edmund Spenser was not the only one to know-in moments of supreme exulta- tion "painful pleasure turns to pleasing pain."6 Most of us love to have a good cry over a sad story and to be frightened to death by a ghost-story or an "appoint- ment with fear." More people than are willing to admit it are longing to be tor- tured and to become the willing victims of those who enjoy inflicting pain. As to morals, ethics, customs-all of them words denoting just social, com- munal habits-the Greek sophists, in- spired by the reports of adventurous Greek travelers, were the first to note that they vary considerably from one place to the other, from time to time. Some people, like the Himalayan tribe in Kipling's Kim, live in polyandry, one wife having several husbands; others live in polygamy like the Hebrew patriarchs. Some peoples' laws consider even bigamy a crime, some law-codes like the Islamic shariat will allow up to four wives and enjoin upon the husband an equitable division of his affection in quarter ra- tions. Some tribes, like the ruling dynas- ties of ancient Persia and the Ptolemaean rulers of Egypt, command brothers and sisters to marry to keep the noble blood pure, while others consider what they call incest-that is un-chastity-the most unnatural crime within our ken. Some people-Christian people-thought slav- ery divinely instituted because of the curse on Ham in Gen. 9:25. We, how- ever, think it abominable. "The challenge" of all this to our rea- son, as Professor H. A. Hodges said, is "to do justice to relativity without mak- ing it the basis of nihilism."7 6 (I552-0o) Epithalamium, c. X, LX. 7 Socratic Digest, No. 2, June, I944, p. 27. This problem is by no means insoluble. In physics, relativity theory is not a pro- cedure introducing general relativity into our description of physical reality but one of formulating our propositions in such a way that they become absolute- ly valid in spite of all our sense experience being relative to the spatio-temporal position of the observer, more precisely to the cosmic position of any conceivable observer. In the same way science or rather the unified timological, or axiological sci- ences of economics, aesthetics, jurispru- dence, and ethics must be able to deal with a world of purely subjective and relative values in such a way that abso- lute principles of economic exchange or catallactics, of artistic creation and aes- thetic receptivity, and finally of moral and legal obligation can be stated and the nihilistic negation of such absolutely valid truths excluded. As to the problem of moral obligation with which I am mainly concerned, we cannot derive its solution from the reve- lations of any inspired prophet because the Sacred Books of the East, notably the scriptures known to us as the Bible or Book of Books which attribute direct divine inspiration to certain prophets, distinguish in so many words false from true prophets. They answer the question which are true and which the false proph- ets with the circular argument8 that the true prophet is he who prophesies truly and that the words of the false prophet are not those of the Lord but spoken presumptuously. Nor can we derive our moral principles from the Scriptures for which tradition claims divine inspiration, for the proph- ets who actually claim this privilege for themselves clearly and unambiguously deny the indubitable authenticity of the 8Deut. i8:22.</page><page sequence="10">86 ETHICS written law books. In seventh century B.C., the prophet Jeremiah, the son of a priest at the temple of Jerusalem, denied -speaking in the very name of his God- the authenticity and divine inspiration of the whole priestly code concerning sacri- fices now to be read in the books Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers of our Bible:9 "I spoke not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices; but this thing I commanded them, Hearken unto my voice" uttered of course through the prophet, whose di- vine authorization we can only judge by ascertaining the truth or falseness of his alleged message. A page later he says in clear and un- ambiguous words: "Thus said the Lord 'How can ye say, We are wise and the Law of the Lord is with us?' Behold, the lying pen (et shower) of the scribes hath made of it falsehood (shequer)." This pas- sage-obscured in all the versions includ- ing the English ones-says clearly that the text of the Law has been falsified by the scribes interpolating such essential passages as the sacrificial system on which the whole livelihood of the priest- hood depended. In the Proclamations of St. Peter (Kerygmata Petrou) quoted in the so-called Clementine Homilies, St. Peter says that the laws of Moses were not written down till long after Moses and that it is therefore necessary to find out "the genuine parts of the Scriptures" among the numerous forgeries. Jesus himself, who said that he had "not come to abolish one jot or tittle of the Law," is quoted by the Fathers as exhorting his disciples to "become like trustworthy money-changers [dokimoi trapezitai] able to distinguish the faked from the genuine." In the canonic gos- 9 Jer. 9:22; cf. 6:20. pels themselves Jesus quotes'0 the proph- et Isaiah where he upbraids the Pharisees for asserting the validity of 6I3 com- mandments alleged to have been re- vealed to Moses on Mount Sinai and tells them that most of these laws are "man-made commandments," entalmata anthropon. I have no doubt whatever that the so- called Antinomism, the Pauline denial of the validity of the alleged Mosaic laws, can be traced beyond Paul and Peter to Jesus himself. Ever since Goethe, the poet who discovered this as a very young man and wrote an essay on the subject, "What Was Written on the Tablets of the Law," it is known to biblical critics that we have the so-called Ten Commandments themselves in two quite different and mutually incompatible versions in chap- ters 20 and 34 of the book Exodus, ob- viously derived from the two well-known sources of the book. They cannot both be authentic and most impartial histori- ans are now convinced that both of them must be the work of the scribes who wrote these two sources because the ark of the covenant did not contain any longer the second stone-tablets upon which, tradition says, the command- ments quoted in chapter 34 were in- scribed, when it stood in Solomon's temple, having been brought back empty from the land of the Philistines who had captured it.I2 As to the first tablets with the inscription quoted in chapter 20, they are said to have been smashed by Moses himself.'3 But even if we assume, for the sake of the argument, that this conflicting evidence does not preclude the possibility that the Ten Commandments quoted in Exodus 20-those that are still learned '0 Mark 7: 7; Matt.

Let us again quote one of the best- beloved clergymen of the Church of Eng- land, the late Vicar of St.Martin's-in- the-Fields and Dean of Canterbury, Dick Sheppard, founder of the Peace Pledge Union. He wrote a book We Say No which has become another Bible for most of our conscientious objectors. Dean Matthews of St. Paul's says it is his best book.'4 In it he tries to prove that war- even defensive war-is absolutely wrong because it is against the commandment "Thou shalt not kill," and opposed to the whole spirit of Jesus. He says twice that the command "Thou shalt not kill" is absolute. But how can this be true if capital punishment, to be carried out through stoning or other means by the commu- nity, is enjoined for various crimes? Exod. I7:I3 (two pages before chap- ter 20:I3) reports with approval that Josuah "discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of his sword." After the legislation Moses says to the judges of Israel, "Slay every man that was joined to Ba'al Pe'or" (Num. 25: 5); also Phinehas kills Zimri who had es- poused a Midianite woman, committing what the Nazis, inspired by Luther's version of this passage, called the "out- rage against racial purity." The truth is simply that the command should run in English: "Thou shalt not murder" (kill '4 R. Ellis Roberts, H. R. L. Sheppard's Life and Letters (London: Murray, I942), p. 334. unlawfully), the Hebrew language using the verb qatal indiscriminately for both authorized killing and illicit murdering. If it is impossible to deduce a condem- nation of either war or capital punish- ment from the prohibition "Thou shalt not murder" in the Ten Commandments, the same holds true of the Noachic Com- mandment in Gen. 9:5 and 6: "At the hand of every man's brother will I re- quire the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood he shed, for in the image of God made he man." Is the murderer who has shed blood still our brother, or are we to kill him in reprisal because he is the murderer of his brother? Is the aggressive invader of my country killing our brothers never- theless my brother, and are we murderers when we are killing in self-defense and in defense of our brothers and sisters? If one turns with Dick Sheppard from the obsolete Old to the New Testament, one finds Jesus preaching in the Sermon on the Mount nonresistance to evil and love for our enemies. But one also reads that at the end of his career (Luke 22: 35 if. ) Jesus altered his sweeping precept and bade his followers to arm them- selves, evidently not for aggression but to defend themselves: "When I sent you without purse and script and shoes, lacked you -anything? And they said Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse let him take it, likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one. And they said-Lord, behold, here are two swords"-or rather daggers (machairai), being armed after the man- ner of the so-called sicarians with two short daggers-"and he said to them That is enough." He had said before, sadly, that he had not come to bring peace but a sword. If such a fundamental issue as the</page><page sequence="12">88 ETHICS problem whether or not human life is to be held absolutely inviolable and killing as absolutely condemned cannot be solved by consulting the Law and the Prophets, one would not expect minor ethical problems such as those concern- ing the relations between the sexes to be soluble by this method. If one takes the trouble to reread in Hansard the con- tributions made by the bishops in the House of Lords to the debate on the bill of the member for Oxford University, Mr. (now Sir) Alan P. Herbert, to reform the divorce laws, one will see how their quotations from the Scriptures only made confusion worse confounded. Now this is nothing new; if one opens such an easily accessible book of refer- ence as the Encyclopaedia Britannica one finds in the iith edition-the last which has not yet sacrificed information on the humanities to an attempt to cope more extensively with the progress of techni- cal achievement-one finds an introduc- tion to the article Ethics by an Oxford scholar, Henry Herbert Williams, saying: "No one since civilization emerged from barbarism has ever been really willing to yield allegiance to a deity who is not moral in the fullest and highest sense of the word. God is not superior to moral law. Yet there have been whole systems of theological ethics which have attempted to base human morality upon the arbitrary will of God or upon a divinely inspired book or code of laws." That this is impossible was already quite well known in Oxford in i91 I . Does this impossibility leave us in the position of nihilism denying all valid moral obli- gations? It does not of course do any- thing of the sort. It only throws us back to the position, clearly stated in two passages of the very Law and the Proph- ets, none of which can provide us with any other revealed fundament of moral obligation. We read in Deuteronomy, traditionally known as the Fifth Book of Moses:I5 "This commandment which I command thee this day is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it? But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it." As to the Prophets, we read in Jeremi- ah ". . . Saith the Lord: I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts" ; 6 and Paul of Tarsus paraphrases this, "written not with ink ... not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart."I7 What else is this but that the moral obligation is given to us in what we commonly and in everyday parlance call our conscience-con-scientia -which is nothing but our common con- sciousness and what Kant has called our practical reason? Does not every one of us know quite clearly at every moment whenever he subjects his actions to his reason--even when he acts contrary to the command of what we call his con- science or "practical reason" and has to say with Ovid video meliora proboque de- teriora sequor'8-whether- he is right or wrong? I refer again to what Henry Herbert Williams said in his article in that pedes- trian reference book, the Encyclopaedia Britannica: "The questions which ethics attempts to answer are never questions with which the moral consciousness as such is confronted."

Quite obviously the problem of the empiric basis of moral obligation or duty is to find out what is this conscience of ours, this direct emotional consciousness of right or wrong. Socrates spoke in this context of a daimonion within himself, a little demon or divinity, which occasion- ally warned him not to do a thing. This shows quite clearly the human tendency to personify and to consider our con- science or moral consciousness as some- thing divine or, to use an ancient Latin term resurrected by Rudolf Otto, as something numinous, a mysteriously awe-inspiring intuition, not to be looked at too closely because of the dangers in- herent in the procedure. To explain our moral intuition, our sense of duty, by reducing it to something more simple, more easily understandable and less mysterious, is called by a certain school of thought the heresy of naturalism and considered as in itself a morally question- able undertaking. I feel convinced that this is a mere superstition and that there is nothing mysterious, supernatural, or, in Greek, metaphysical in our moral re- actions. Kant, as we all know, said that he felt the profoundest admiration for two sublime things, moral law and the starry heavens. Just as it was legitimate for Newton to reduce the once mys- terious and awe-inspiring movements of the eternal stars to the principle that governs the fall of an apple in his own back-garden, there is nothing sacrilegious in looking for what the theologian would call a natural explanation of these simple but deeply rooted human feelings. Also the explanation is not difficult to find and is offered to us by nothing more remote than that little pronoun we which we have substituted for the word I in the Cartesian formula cogito ergo, trans- forming it into cogitatmus for the purpose of establishing on a firm epistemological footing the Heraclitean discovery that "we have language and reason in com- mon" (ho logos xynos) and that only our dreams are private. Just as our theory of knowledge is thus based on Heraclitus, we can derive our empiric, naturalistic explanation of our sense of duty, our moral conscience or moral sense from Aristotle, curiously and characteristically enough from Aristotle the zoologist. In his book On the Nature of Animals he classifies man as one of the urban or civic animals (zoia politika) co- operating by what we call division of labor, even as bees and ants do, and says that these urban animals are a subdivi- sion of the gregarious animals (zoia age- laia), living in herds or packs or swarms like wild sheep, oxen, wolves, or cranes in contradistinction to solitary or dispersed animals (zoia sporadika), such as the feline beasts of prey, wildcats, tigers, lions, among whom even males and fe- males unite for only a short time, and the mother drives her kittens or whelps away as soon as they can fend for them- selves. This, as modern sociology has more and more come to recognized is a fundamental observation. A herd of sheep or oxen or a pack of wolves is now described as a meta-zoon or meta-organ- ism with reactions similar to the indi- vidual organism known since Virchow to be an aggregation of simpler organisms of a proto-zoic character, called cells. While the individual wolf is a weaker predatory animal than the lion, compared to the biggest solitary hunting cat the wolf pack is a far more powerful and to its prey far more dangerous predatory or- ganism, able to spread out in a pincer- movement while running down its vic- i9Laurence Housman, "Sin and the Herd In stinct," Hibbert Journal, XLIV (January, I946), 97-I05.</page><page sequence="14">go ETHICS tims. The most dangerous of all the predatory animals is the lupine human pack which succeeded and subdued the harmless fruit-eating and nonfighting herds of the ovine and bovine type of the original arboreal, bracchiating primates from which we are descended. Ouden dei- noteron, anthropou, pelei "Nothing is more formidable than man," said Sopho- cles, nearly 2,500 years before the inven- tion of the atomic bomb, but tens of thousands of years after man learned to wield the flaming torch of Prometheus and to set whole prairies afire, putting the terror of man into every living creature. This is the zoological and sociological description of what we mean when we say we. The Logos, now the language of our reason, was originally but the herd voice which enabled us to cogitate, to co-agitate, constantly and intensively to put together and pool our common ex- perience. It must be obvious once atten- tion has been called to it, that the very coherence of this super-organism or meta-zoon is not achieved by molecular cohesion, adhesion, and osmotic penetra- tion, by which the cells of the individual organism hang together, but by vapor- trails, sound- and light-waves carrying smell-, sound-, and light-signals over the distance separating the component in- dividuals who keep formation by react- ing according to these connecting sig- nals. It is, therefore, a complete illusion to think of our consciousness or con- science in terms of a closed solipsist cir- cuit of individual reactions to individual surroundings. All the problems of reduc- ing to a sum of sense-data and sensibilia -esse est percipi-physical realities- such as the famous unseen clock ticking away in the room next door, the odd sycamore tree persisting in the quad when there is nobody to see it but God, the things at the back of my head I can never see disappear like mist in the sun the moment we realize that the discontinuous series of our pri- vate experiences is shot through and through with and strung up on a struc- ture of intersubjective communication signals keeping the meta-organism of a herd or pack in formation. While the lower meta-organisms such as bee-, ant-, and termite-states or bird-swarms are held in line by inherited behavior-pat- terns known as instincts, the cohesion of the more adaptable primate herds is achieved by means of more flexible be- havior-patterns acquired in the course of one generation through the contact with the preceding one which we call educa- tion and, looking at it from the other side, learning. Such terms as a body of men, the body politic, Greek soma poleos, Latin corpus or corporation, are by no means figura- tive, just as it is no mere figure of speech to say that a solid inanimate body con- sists in reality of a mass of molecules, swirling atoms, electrons, protons, neu- trons, etc. Just as there is a structure of radii vectores centered in a point behind my nose where the axes of my eyes con- verge, stringing together the individual incommunicable four-dimensional sensa- tions to a spider-web like unity which I call indiscriminately my self, my ego, my consciousness, my mind, there is a looser but none the less real group-mind struc- ture of world-lines, appropriately called esprit de corps for which the word we (in Latin the nos-to match the ego) is the proper designation. As a result of the signaling contacts of sound- and light- waves and vapor-trails between the indi- vidual selves constituting the esprit de corps of the herd meta-organism, the emotional reactions of the ego are con- stantly interspersed with the reflected</page><page sequence="15">THE EMPIRIC BASIS OF MORAL OBLIGATION 9I emotions of the group-mind which is the super-ego of the modern psychoanalyst. Just as the individual emotions of pleasure and pain enable every single ego to react according to its more or less per- fect adaptation to the respective, con- stantly changing environment and thus to insure a certain probability of survival of the individual organism, the emotions of the group-mind are constantly react- ing to the favorable or unfavorable effects of individual behavior upon the survival chances of the herd or meta- organism. The individual is trained from the start of its quasi-separate life to react constantly to the sensed or imagined emotional reactions of the group. Every child is house-trained to that amount of cleanliness which is indeed as Wesley said, "next to godliness" by a mother or nurse from whom the mother-tongue is simultaneously acquired by a system of emotional signals, growls, or clicks threatening and-or accompanied by little punishments and rewards, slaps and caresses just as they are used for the training of performing tame animals. Monosyllabic atomic adjectives like good or bad expressing mere approval or disapproval of something or someone are but such clicks or growls and snaps as the interjections bah, boo-"can't say boo to a goose"-phew!, German pfui, French fi, all imitating sounds of spitting and spewing, while good, gut, bon (in bon-bon), Greek agathon are pleasurable, swallowing, palatizing, and chewing sounds. They are not essentially differ- ent from yes, oui, or si, the the sucking in sounds, and no, nein, non, the sound produced through the closed lips, indi- cating the refusal to absorb. Less primitive are figurative apprecia- tions or disapprobations like right, recht, which mean aimed straight at the goal, while wrong is nothing but wrung, from wring, distort, divert forcibly from the straight or right line of approach to the end, both terms really approving or dis- approving of means to an end, the end itself being taken for granted. The really significant, fully understood terms for corporative or social approval are the Latin and Romance words honest or honorable and dishonest or dishonor- able. Nothing is more characteristic than the very different emotional reactions to the mere clicks and growls of approval or disapproval and the transparent words implying social respect or disrespect in both directions. It does not ruffle me if a young lady calls me, for one reason or another, "a wicked old man" or "a bad lot." I just take it to mean she would prefer a bad boy or, for that matter, a good boy. Also I should feel ridiculous if, I told you I am a good man, so to say clicking my tongue in silly self-admira- tion. But how furious I would be if some- body said that I am a dishonest or dis- honorable character, a person without honor. I should fly at the throat of the aggressor or, if prevented from taking the law into my own hands, be forced to give good money to a solicitor for the purpose of starting a libel action in a law-court. Also, few people would object to strengthening a promise or an asser- tion by giving their word of honor or saying honor bright, thereby asserting that they are men who value the honor society is willing to pay them and would not risk courting social dishonor by their behavior. As soon as the meaningless clicks and growls, good and bad, are replaced by the transparent expressions, the timological and axiological terms honest, honorable (Greek timios) and the contrary, we see immediately that our moral conscience is just the con-science, the knowledge we have in common with the community of</page><page sequence="16">92 ETHICS understanding with whom we have the language and all the thoughts expressed in it, in common. Group approval or dis- approval is impressed upon us from the start of our helpless in-fancy or speech- lessness by all the words and signs we learn to have in common. The dreaded penalty for incurring grave family or so- cial or group displeasure is ipso facto ex- communication. If communion, speech- communion of con-nation-als (people born together, as it were, as one litter), is the cohesion which keeps the body politic or meta-organism of the herd or pack in existence and gives it a survival chance far superior to that of the isolated lone wolf or rogue bull, it is obvious that ex- communication from the com-pany or bread-pool means a potential death sen- tence for the out-cast or out-sider. This again is nothing new or paradoxi- cal. The very words ethics, from Greek ethos-morals, morality, from Latin mores, mean customs, habits, habitual behavior-patterns of a group to which the individual must necessarily conform, if he wants to belong. Otherwise, auto- matically by his own group-trained pub- lic-spirited conscience and, in due course (the truth being known by detection and discovery) by social ex-communication, he is a temporary or permanent outcast or rank outsider, expelled because of immorality, that is nonconformity to the group-behavior pattern impressed upon the constituent members of the group by the moral discipline of being a disciple or little learner. Centuries ago, no less a moralist than the famous essayist Michel de Montaigne (1533-92) said: Les lois de la conscience que nous disons naistre de nature, naissent de la coustume.20 "The laws of conscience we think to be born from nature" (i.e., inborn) "are born from custom." 20 Essays, Book I, chap. 22. This explains of course immediately why morals are primarily valid within the speech-community of the xynos logos and not without; why it is murder to kill our brother, but licit to destroy an enemy's manpower in aggressive or de- fensive war; why we are told to love our neighbor as ourselves, but so often cannot muster enough imagination and sym- pathy to concern ourselves with the fate of far-away natives of another continent, worked to death by colonial taskmasters half maddened by the tropical sun of Africa and the consolations of alcohol; why we must not lie at home and at school while our country may send out diplomats defined by Sir Henry Wotton as "honest men sent abroad to lie for the good of their country" ;21 and why the above-quoted Michel de Montaigne says, "The public weal requires that a man should betray and lie and massacre." The simple fact that genus komo con- sisted from the start of a number of herds, gradually stratified, as Wilfred Trotter has begun to show, by the super- position of predatory, dominant, lupine packs over the peaceful, harmless, vege- tarian, primate herds,22 and that there never was one herd of herds-grex una, pastor unus, lex una-explains not only that there are in the world different lan- guages instead of that one common word and common reason, called the logos xynos by Heraclitus to whom only the Greeks were logioi andres, all other men speechless, unreasoning "mutterers" (bar- baroi); thus the Slavs call themselves those who have slovo, the word, while their German neighbors are niemiec, the mute ones. This explains also that there are dif- 2I Ambassador of King James at Augsburg, i604. 22 See the author's paper, "Man into Wolf: An Anthropological Account of the Fall,"IHibbert Jour- nal, XLIV (January, I946), I59-65.</page><page sequence="17">THE EMPIRIC BASIS OF MORAL OBLIGATION 93 ferent moral systems connected with these different groups, some of which proclaim the greatest happiness of the greatest number, some of which think "the fullest life of a leading elite" is the supreme aim of mankind, some of which say that the individual exists to serve the state, others that the state has no other function but to serve the individual, with nobody to decide which of the claims, if any, is true. Again I ask whether this diversity and relativity of moral standards implies a nihilistic nega- tion of moral obligation or an excuse for immoral behavior? The answer is of course in the negative. Just as the validity of our national law codes or our common law is not impaired by the fact that different nations have different laws, each one completely valid in the country and for the nation which has adopted it, the validity of the different moral standards prevailing in the various communities of a pluralist world is ab- solute within and for the community which has evolved it. As Socrates felt himself obliged to submit to the intoler- ant laws of Athens enabling the majority of the citizens to condemn an honest man to death for his allegedly subversive opinions, a human being must necessarily act in conformity with the moral stand- ards of his group if he or she does not want to incur dishonor and excommuni- cation from the group. But what differentiates this ethical relativism from the traditional belief in absolute moral values is the fact that our relativism justifies at all times our subjecting the moral standards of our group to rational criticism. Because for us as reasoning men the summum bonum is truth and our supreme duty the search for truth we are justified in attacking as immoral a still valid law of the land which we are bound to obey, such as the Official Secrets Act, and in agitating to the best of our ability for the earliest possible repeal of this iniquitous con- straint upon our duty to publish what we know to be true. We are at all times and at all costs entitled to question whether or not the moral tenets of our group are really and truly conducive to the survival of and the dynamic equilib- rium within our community because it is self-evident that a behavior-pattern which diminishes the chances of group- survival and communal harmony cannot be truly right and worthy of our ap- proval. If we incur dishonor and ex- communication from our group for this non-conformist attitude, this is a sacrifice we may be willing to accept because we value the sincere search for truth more than the honor which our group-com- panions can pay us. We do not allow ourselves to say "right or wrong, my group," or with Stephen Decatur (i8i6) "right or wrong, my country," "right or wrong my nation." We do not say that only an individual can be right or wrong, honest or dishonest; that the nation or community, like the king in constitution- al theory,23 can do no wrong, cannot act either honorably or dishonorably. Knowing that a nation constituted as a modern state of the totalitarian variety can mold the mentality of the average individual citizen by a pressure of well- nigh irresistible power into a pattern most objectionable to the interests of the world-wide community of reasoning men bound together by a common allegiance to truth as the summum bonum, we have a supreme standard by which to judge the behavior of a whole nation, state, or whatever community it may be which considers it permissible to lie, betray, and massacre pro bono public, and to pervert the dictates of our common 23Blackstone, Commentaries, Book III, chap. 17.</page><page sequence="18">94 ETHICS reason so as to be able to assert "right is what profits my nation." Although there is not and there never was a single human herd of herds, although there is as yet no power to defend the in- terests of all mankind against the assault of predatory violence, there is an espirt de corps, there is a logos xynos of all men, whatever language they may use to express their thought, who are sincerely devoted to the service of the one supreme aim-the search of homo sapiens for knowledge and truth. It is their voice, reaching out to the furthest distances of the inhabited earth and sig- naling by means of waves harnessed to their service by scientific discovery, which condemns unanimously the sacro egoismo, the accursed group-egotism and anarchism of the single big and small na tions refusing to surrender the mean and deceptive illusion, which they call their sovereignty and their alleged right to absolute national self-determination and autonomy. Their persecution madness is driving them like the Gadarene swine into the abyss of perdition for which they are now headed. It is the voice of the seekers for truth which has spoken up throughout history, carrying conviction without resorting either to fraud or to violence; of those who have labored ever since the earliest Assyrian Book of Law was engraved in cuneiform characters upon tablets of clay to construct systems of thought de- signed to protect the producers of all the goods we consume against the depreda- tions of those who resort to fraud or vio- lence instead of relying on the equitable give and take of honest trade. It is the voice of men who have learned from the poet Grillparzer (i848) that "the path of modern culture" has led us "from the humanity" of the enlightened i8th cen- tury "through nationality to bestiality"; from Nurse Edith Cavell to "realise that patriotism is not enough" ;24 who pro- fess, each one of them, as Socrates did, kosmopolites eimi, "I am a citizen of the whole world"; this voice is still drowned by the roar of the great strong wind that rent the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks of New Mexico, by the rumble of the earthquake and the crackling of the fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in all of which "the Lord was not." It is as yet a still, small voice, but in it is the Truth. It is the voice of all we hold sacred, for which we are willing to live and, if need be, to die. LONDON 24 Dec. 8, I9I5.</page></plain_text>
