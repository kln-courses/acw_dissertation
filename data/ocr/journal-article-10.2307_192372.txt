<plain_text><page sequence="1">Constraints on the Sociobiologists' Program Stuart A. Kauffman University of Pennsylvania Sociobiology is a relatively recent effort at the synthesis of the fields of anthropology, ethology, and evolutionary biology ([1], [2], [7]). The structure of the present commentary is to present briefly the aim of Sociobiology in its own view, and to state how it formulates and attempts to solve its own designated problems. Then I attempt to characterize the adequacy of the presuppositions which a narrow form of Sociobiology seems to make, and the consequences of abandoning those presuppositions. Further, I shall try to characterize the core difficulties in assessing the ways in which genes determine behavior, for, as will soon emerge, this is central to the Sociobiologist's program. An analysis of those difficulties helps counter cavalier criticisms of Sociobiology, and begins to suggest some of the means to surmount the methodological difficulties which impede this important scientific effort. The program of Sociobiology rests on several tenets which seem both well founded, and deeply important. It is a matter of common observa- tion that the behavior of different species differs. We know that species have evolved. We inevitably conclude that behavior too has evolved. It is hardly contentious to consider the behaviors of members of a species as a phenotype spectrum characterizing that species. In brief, the aim of Sociobiology is to account for the evolution of behavior through the conceptual tools of evolutionary theory. The importance of such an analysis, were it successful, can hardly be in doubt; it would cast human sociality into novel perspective, perhaps as much as Darwin jolted our sense of the human stance in the organic world. What are the questions formulated by Sociobiology? They cluster around the problem of how forms of sociality have evolved among orga- nisms. To assert that behavior is a phenotype which has evolved necessarily presumes that behavior is heritable. Thus the Sociobiologist is committed to saying that the evolution of behavior is PSA 1976, Volume 2, pp. 32-47 Copyright ? 1977 by the Philosophy of Science Association</page><page sequence="2">33 coordinated with the evolution of the genotype of diverse species. It is important to note at the outset that the Sociobiologist need not be restricted to saying that all evolution of behavior requires evolution of the genotype, even if evolution of any kind does require some form of heritability. For the condition that novel behavior be heritable, but without reference to alterations of the genome, is clearly met by cultural transmission in humans. Nevertheless, Sociobiology to date has focused primarily on the "biological" evolution of behavior, based on evolution of the genotype, for several obvious reasons: (1) In examining the enormous range of organisms among which behavior has evolved, there is no evidence of culture and its transmission among the vast majority--here only reference to the evolving genome seems perti- nent; (2) The confounding of cultural evolution with organic evolution in human behavior is obviously among the most difficult, if fascinating, complications which Sociobiology faces; (3) It is particularly important that the common form of Sociobiology focuses on the biological evolution of behavior precisely because it feels that it is here that it has the most fertile ground for application of its novel explanatory schema. How does that schema function? What I shall call "narrow" Sociobiology rests on a rather strict selectionist version of Darwinian evolution. Such a selectionist view, which used to be nearly the universal view among evolutionary biologists, held that only those traits persist which have been selected for promo- tion of maximal reproductive success. To exist at all is to have successfully competed and been selected. Under this rubric, any trait whatsoever, is to be analyzed by accounting for the manner in which that trait abetted reproductive success. This strict selectionist view therefore not only offers a framework in which to ask and answer why some trait persists, but to assess the proper function of that trait. The trait's function is given by the manner in which it furthers reproductive success. Just as Freud's analysis of sexuality as the "true" reason for our conscious acts altered our preception of our behavior, the promised explanatory power of a narrow selectionist analysis of human sociality rests in large part on such reevaluation of the function, and occurrence of human social forms. Within the strict selectionist Sociobiology, the statement of its problems rests upon the postulate that selection acts only on individ- uals, not on groups. While some evolutionary biologists now doubt this tenet, its assumption confronts the sociobiologist with the following questions: Why do social groups form in the first place? What conceiv- able forms of individual selection could lead to the forms of sociality observed? For example, how could it ever be to the reproductive advantage of a sterile worker bee to be sterile? Alexander ([1], [2]) states the problem nicely in pointing out the automatic disadvantages of social living in increased competition for resources and exposure to pestilence. Modern attempts to account for the evolu- tion of sociality under individual selection makes use of three notions: reciprocal altruism, nepotism or kin selection, and parental molding. In the first, it pays one organism to aid the reproductive effort of a second if its own ultimate gain in reproductive success exceeds the cost</page><page sequence="3">34 of giving aid. In nepotism, it may pay an organism to hinder its direct reproductive success if by so doing it disproportionately aids nieces and nephews with which it shares, on average, 1/4 its genes, or even more numerous, but more distant relatives with whom it shares 1/8, or 1/16, etc. its genome. In parental molding, it may pay a parent to promote altruism among its offspring in furthering its own reproductive success, even if it is not in the immediate interest of each offspring's individual reproductive success to desist competition with its siblings. Utilizing such tools, surprisingly precise predictive statements about human kinship and mating rules can be made, as Dr. Alexander has exemplified ([1], [2]). I will return to such efforts below. Here I have merely wished to sketch in the program of Sociobiology. In its fullest extension, it would hope to analyze the complete range of human social behavior. Regardless of its promise, such a narrow, strictly selectionist Sociobiology, rapidly runs into severe problems, even in the analysis of behavior in simple organisms. (1) It is not clear to what extent genes do, or could, determine behavior. Biologists speak of the genes "giving up their sovereignty." As we shall see, this raises profound problems in any attempt to prove that a specific behavior is to be accounted for by reference to biological evolutionary forces. (2) The postulate that all phenotypes are adapted is almost certainly false. Consider that any physical system can be described as "doing" indefinitely many things, that is, exhibiting indefinitely many traits. All these attributes almost certainly cannot be simultaneously "adapted". As any design engineer knows, some properties of any system, or organism are likely to be maladapted, but requisite parasitic consequences of other properties which are being selected and optimized. Indeed, even if the organism as a whole were maximally adapted for reproductive success, it in no way follows that each of its indefinitely properties is maximally adapted. In addition to the general doubt that all traits could possibly be simultaneously individually maximally adapted, the current theory of evolution admits a critical further relaxation of the narrow claim that all traits are adaptive. It is now widely believed that some properties evolve by random drift and gene fixation, with no, or essentially no, selective force. Thus, even assuming that Sociobiology can successfully analyze the claim that behavior is determined by the genome, it cannot claim that all such genetically determined behaviors are adapted. The consequence is that the rote application of the selectionist explanatory rubric to account for the existence and function of any aspect of behavior as promoting reproductive success might seriously fail. With respect to this function, some behaviors might be neutral, fixed by drift, others might be maladapted parasitic consequences of constraints in the</page><page sequence="4">35 organism's repertoire. Thus even to the extent that Sociobiologists can claim that genes determine behavior, they inevitably face the more difficult task of analyzing how any given behavior trait managed to evolve, and whether it now or ever was, adapted for reproductive success. In giving up a strict selectionist view, which Sociobiology almost certainly must relinquish, it simultaneously relinquishes a universal framework within which it might search for why a behavior might exist at all, and what its proper function is. How seriously does this strike at Sociobiology, and does it strike only at Sociobiology? Obviously, it strikes at all evolutionary explanation, for the universal framework is shown not to be universal but more restricted in its applicability. Therefore it is rather malign to lay too critical a burden on Sociobiology for confronting problems in common with all evolutionary explanation. The methodologi- cal problem is how to assess when a given trait, behavioral or other- wise, has been selected, when it has drifted, and when it has been inadvertently selected through correlation with some other trait being actively optimized. The methodological problems are not peculiar to Sociobiology, and if they are overcome, promise important insights in Sociobiology, as elsewhere. Where behavioral traits have evolved by coincidental selection we learn something of the correlated behavioral options of the organism. Where such traits evolve by drift and fixation we learn something of all the frozen accidents which neverthe- less suffice for successful life. Let us pause to restate the core program of Sociobiology. (1) Biological evolution requires that all the properties upon which it act be heritable. (2) Only those properties which are specified by the genome are biologically heritable, and consequently have undergone biological evolution. (3) Hence, in so far as genes determine behavior, such behavior can and has undergone biological evolution. (4) Evolutionary theory can explain such behavior. An extremely serious constellation of problems confronts Sociobiology in an attempt to make use of premise (3). The sense in which genes determine behavior is deeply in need of clearheaded analysis. Biologists say the genes have "largely given up their sovereignty". What does that mean, and what role for the gene is left? How do we attempt to assess that role experimentally? Even granted the universal framework of a strictly selectionist view of evolution, evolutionary biologists had long argued about just what aspects of the organism selection was acting upon. If the causal relation between genome and behavior is sufficiently tenuous, it is by no means obvious, even were some behavior highly advantageous to reproductive success, that it would even be possible to increase the probability of that behavior by alterations of the genome. Perhaps vast ranges of human behavior are beyond the reach of biological evolution. And, even where such biological evolution is possible, if both random drift and inadvertent selection are possible, yet the relation between genome and behavior is tenuous, how are we to assess which behaviors were selected parasitic- ally, or how wide a range of behavior might be determined by drift?</page><page sequence="5">36 If it is a reasonable goal for Sociobiology to attempt to explain behaviors to the extent that they are genetically determined, then it can only aid that process to try to analyze where the limits to such determination may lie. I want to discuss: (1) grounds to believe that for a wide range of human actions, it may be clear from an analysis of how we attribute ascriptions of human acts, that search for an underlying genomic "causation" is simply beside the point and systematically foredoomed; and (2) some of the known ways that genes almost certainly "abdicate their sovereignty" in any adapting organism and then try to analyze the consequences for Sociobiology. We can readily imagine a gene system which underlies twitches, or even territoriality. But can we seriously imagine a gene which causes a full-fledged intentional, and conventional human act such as signalling a left turn while driving an automobile? And if not, why not? I do not wish here to enter into a lengthy discussion, but rather to point, en passant, to some conceptual difficulties which must arise if one wishes to say full-fledged human acts are "caused by genes". First, I recall to you the extensive philosophic literature dealing with the question of the relation between explanations of human acts in terms of reasons, purposes, and motives, versus explanations in terms of neural events. That entire debate must recur if we substitute "gene" for "nerve". That is, substitute the notion of a biochemical genomic computer for that of a neural computer, and suppose for our argument that such a genomic computer could learn during the life of an organism. (Indeed, in the sense of history dependent alterations of its dynamical responses to the environment even E. coli can learn.) Consider the following well-known philosophic example. A person ignorant of the convention for signalling a left turn in a car, might, in pointing to a tree from his car window, nevertheless, be correctly described as having signalled a left turn. That is, our acts are often identified as the acts that they are with reference to a convention laden social nexus. This example was brought forth long ago to cast doubt on any attempt to form a necessary and sufficient, one to one, correspondence between any one individual's "brain state" and his act. For here, reference to an entire social system and its conventions is necessary to identify and characterize his act. For the purpose of the present argument, read "genomic state" for "brain state". Another example will suffice to indicate the problem area. Our acts are open to descriptions at different, probably non-reducible levels, Consider the three following descriptions of what is, in some sense, the same event. (1) The jury found Smith guilty. (2) Twelve people filed into the room and Mr. Jones uttered the following words, "We find Smith guilty", given as a report by one who knows nothing of law systems, or the meaning of the quoted phrase. (3) The following physical movements occurred and sound waves were produced - a description by a stern behaviorist. All three descriptions are true of the event. The legal description, using the concept family of law, evidence, guilt, etc.</page><page sequence="6">37 probably cannot be placed into one to one correspondence with the second description in terms of individual actions stated without borrowing from within the concept family of law. And neither can be placed into 1 to 1 correspondence with a necessary and sufficient set of physical descriptions. That is, as philosophers have long noted, no constellation of, say physical conditions is necessary and sufficient for the truth of the legal description. Thus, if the genes "cause" the state of affairs described by the physical description, it does not follow that they have "caused" the event described by the legal description. The hypothesis that a genomic computer "causes" a way the organism comports itself does not entail that our description of the event, literally our ascriptions of acts to the participants, stand in 1 to 1 correspondence with any unique set of genomic states. If so, then reference to a genetic determination is simply beside the point. In short, the detailed claim, should one wish to make it, that the genome causes a specific human act seems subject to serious logical difficulties. In so far as we can clarify any ways in which our everyday concepts of human acts, and ascriptions of human actions renders restatement in terms of neural or genomic computation beside the point, then we shall be forewarned not mistakenly to think there should be such a neural or genomic computer "determining" the act. It is not that the act is without physical cause, it is that our categori- zation and ascription of the human act in everyday language, is systematically vague or arbitrary with respect to underlying genomic or neural states. As we shall see, such systematic vagueness in the application of action categories in common language with respect to an underlying genomic or neural state, has a close parallel in the ways the behaviors of an adaptive organism viewed as a dynamical system become systemati- cally "vague" with respect to the genome. Whether there are limits imposed by the concepts of human acts to the analysis of genomic determination, there are overwhelming grounds to believe that there are profound limitations to the extent to which genes determine behavior in any complex organism. We turn now to try to trace this critical question. How do the genes lose their sovereignty? Let us begin with an example of virtually complete sovereignty. The base pair sequence of a gene determines the amino acid sequence of the protein for which it codes. The determination of protein by DNA is unique. Due to redun- dancies in the code, any protein might be specified by more than one DNA sequence. Next let us consider thesimplest genetic dynamical cir- cuit. The bacterium E. coli possesses the famous lactose operon. In the absence of exogenous lactose, E. coli neither actively transports lactose into the cell, nor does it synthesize the enzyme beta galactosidase for the metabolic utilization of lactose. When lactose is present in the medium and enters E. coli by passive diffusion, it combines allosterically and cooperatively with a repressor protein, altering that protein's configuration and causing it to fall free of the genetic operator site. Once the operator is free, and if additional conditions on the adjacent promoter are met, transcription</page><page sequence="7">38 is initiated on the neighboring genes specifying a lactose transport enzyme and B galactosidase, Exogenous lactose induces the enzymes which transport it into the cell and metabolize it, This response is directly determined by the genome, However, even at this simplest level of a genomic computer, the genes begin to lose total control of the biochemical system they specify. The lactose operon possesses the property of hysteresis. In an initial low concentration of lactose, the operon is not induced. If the external concentration of lactose is raised above a critical level the operon is activated. Once activated, the transport enzyme suffices to bring in lactose so rapidly, that even if the exogenous lactose is lowered again to its initial level, the operon remains in the active state. Thus, the capacity of the genome to respond to changes in the environment is history dependent. It can switch on for an increase in lactose, but remains trapped in the active state if the transition is from high to moderately low exogenous lactose levels. Thus, the clarity of the picture in which a gene's primary structure determines uniquely the primary structure of a protein is lost as soon as the genome is viewed as a biochemical computer. For now the genome specifies a dynamical system which interacts with the environment and is driven among accessible dynamic states in ways which may rapidly become highly history dependent. Then any one state of the environment can correspond to a variety of dynamical states of different copies of the same organism. No longer is there a unique correspondence between environment and the internal state specified by the genome. The system exhibits a history dependent range of choices of behavior. When we begin to consider the behavior of the integrated biochemical system specified by the genome, we can appreciate the many ways biolo- gists are familiar with weakening the link between any single gene and a phenotype. Often, very many genes influence a given phenotype, and a single gene influences many phenotypes. Even for dominant Mendelian genes, the fraction of organisms exhibiting the abberant phenotype, and the extent of its expression may be highly variable in ways which reflect either modifier gene systems, or environmental perturbations. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, single locus mutants exist which convert an antenna into a leg growing from the fly's head [4]. Yet heat shocks or X-ray perturbations to genetically normal flies at specific larval stages give rise to adults with antennas converted to legs. Progeny of such flies are normal. Waddington [4] showed long ago that selection for ease of "phenocopying" such homeotic mutants by heat shocks, led gradually to a stock of flies which exhibited the antenna to leg conversion without heat shock. A highly polygenic system had been selected. In all these cases except E. coli, we know almost nothing about the dynamical connections among the genes and their products which underly the complex interactions between single loci, polygenic modifier systems, and environmental perturbations. That is, we have little insight into the kind of dynamical system which underlies developmental biology. In an attempt to expose the difficulties which Sociobiology</page><page sequence="8">39 faces in its desire to assess the role genes play in behavior, I shall therefore switch from considering known biological systems, and see what insight can be gained from considering the design principles for an adaptive organism, Ross Ashby has made a fascinating beginning in his book Design for a Brain [3], Ashby's problem is briefly and analogically put as follows: What kind of a machine could function as an autopilot in an airplane with the property that if the machine were wired up to the controls in erroneous and arbitrary ways, the machine could "learn" to fly the airplane properly before it crashed? Ashby conceives of the organism coupled to its environment as an integrated deterministic dynamical system. A brief excursion into the language of deterministic dynamical systems [5] will help make his ideas, and the problems faced by Sociobiology, somewhat clear. A dynamical system consists in a set of N measurable variables. For simplicity, assume all variables are continuous. Then one conceives of an N dimensionalCartesian state space having N axes, one per variable. Any point in that state space is a unique combination of the values of the N variables, and defines a unique state. This state space becomes a deterministic dynamical system when we impose a vector field on the state space, showing how each state changes in time. If we let time increment in small finite steps, dt, each state can be shown with a short arrow leading from it to the state where the system shall be dt later. Starting at some initial state, and allowing time to increment in units of dt, the system follows a succession of arrows along a trajectory, or pathway, in state space. For a deterministic system, the future states are uniquely determined by the present state, hence only one arrow leaves any state, and there is a unique trajectory through any state. By allowing dt to vanish, one obtains the true vector field, in which the arrows are locally tangent to the trajectory followed by the system. For our brief discussion, the critical ideas of dynamical system theory include these: (1) steady states, and their stability properties; (2)more complex attractors; (3) basins of attraction; (4) the existence of many basins of attraction in the state space; (5) the sudden bifur- cation of novel basins of attraction as parameters of the system vary smoothly. A state in a dynamical system may have the property that no arrow leaves it. That is, it is a steady state. From the vicinity of that state, the system may flow to it, as a ball rolls to the bottom of a bowl. Such a steady state is said to be stable. The volume of states surrounding the steady state with the property that if the system is released from any state in the volume it flows to the steady state, is called the basin of attraction of the steady state. The steady state is the attractor. Attractors can be more complex than a steady state. For example, a trajectory can close on itself creating a periodic, oscillatory motion.</page><page sequence="9">40 More than one basin of attraction can exist in the state space. These domains of attraction fill the state space rather like soap bubbles fill a pan. The system stays inside whichever basin of attraction it is initially placed in, unless disturbed by outside fluctuations. The set of distinct attractors in their respective basins of attraction comprise all the mutually exclusive asymptotic behaviors of the system after transients have died down. However,, the architecture of the basins of attraction in the state space depends on all the parameters of the system. If the parameters are gradually varied, the outlines of the basins of attraction gradually deform. Rather like soap bubbles, as the parameters change gradually, basins shrink and vanish, coalesce, or suddenly puff up, while within the basins old steady states disappear, new ones appear, oscillations spring up out of vanishing steady states, etc. In short, tuning the parameters leads to gradual and sometimes abrupt (or bifur- cating) changes in the dynamical behavior of the system. Using these ideas, Ashby's design for a brain is intriguingly simple. Any organism has some set of variables which must be kept within certain bounds for survival; for example, pH, blood glucose, etc. Ashby calls these essential variables (E.V.). He decomposes the organism environ- ment into four parts, the environment, (Env), the reacting system, R, the essential variables, e.v., and a set of parameters, S, of the reacting system R. When placed in some initial state, the Env-R system follows a trajectory to an attractor. That is, the organism behaves with respect to the environment. In so doing the essential variables are driven to some state. If that state is within the survival bounds, the system stops changing. But if the essential variables are driven out- side their survival range, then the set of parameters S begin to change. As S changes, the bubble-like basins of attraction alter, and the Env-R system may find that a former steady state now has become a transient state leading to some new attractor in some other region of state space. The parameters continue to change until the Env-R system possesses an architecture of basins of attractions such that its current state is confined to one attractor which drives the essential variables to within survival bounds. In effect, the system adapts by making continuous, and nearly random changes in its dynamical behavior, or basins of attraction, until it hits upon one which happens to keep the essential variables within bounds. In short, part of adaptation requires roughly random altera- tions in behavior patterns to find one which succeeds. Complete randomness in alterations of behavior patterns is precluded on a design basis, in attempts to design in a capacity to remember past environments, and the capacity to utilize partial successes to accumu- late to overall success in keeping the essential variables in survival range. In fact, Ashby and his colleagues have actually built machines capable of adapting in this fashion, even if arbitrarily wired up to</page><page sequence="10">their enviromnent initially. One colleague has even built the requisite autopilot. M4y impression is that Ashby has got his hands on some essential properties of organisms adapting via learning, and if we read random mutation for parameter change adapting in evolution, Ashby's annoyingly simple machine poses a fine conceptual example of an adapting system. What implications does it provide for the attempt of Sociobiology to assess the relation between genome and behavior? (1) Ashby's machine has the property that there are indefinitely many parameter settings of the system S, such that some basin of attraction of the Env-R dynamical system would suffice to keep the essential variables within survival bonds. That is, there are very many solutions to the task of surviving. (2) Small changes in parameters lead often to very marked changes in the dynamics of the Env-R system - that is, to bifurcations of novel attractors. (3) Properties (1) and (2) imply that if two copies of the machine were started in identical states and subjected to very similar life histories., they would soon diverge enormously both with respect to the positions of their parameters, and the dynamical behavior of the Env-R system. Let us use this analogy, and suppose that some subset of the para- meters S correspond to the genome of the organism. What does it mean then to say that a given gene, the ith parameter, determines the behavior of the entire machine? In fact, in principle, a complete answer to this question can be given for any deterministic machine. One fixes all the S parameters, and explores the entire dynamical range of behaviors of the Env-R system. Then, holding parameter i f ixed, one lets all the remaining parameters in S take on all their combinations of values, and describes all the behaviors of the resulting Env-R dynamical systems. Finally, one lets the ith parameter, the gene in question, vary, and looks, all the behaviors of all the dynamical systems specified by all the sets of values of the remaining parameters, for each value of the ith parameter. That characterizes completely the ways in which the ith parameter constrains the behavior of the entire machine. Even for a small dynamical system with say 10 variables and 5 parameters, this is a forbidding task. Thus, it is in general true, and in fact trivial, that any one parameter's currentvalue shapes the behavior of the entire dynamical system. Obviously, understanding the way it constrains the global behaviors is, in general, very difficult. With this example in mind, let us turn to the most common tool used to exhibit a genetic component in the determination of any phenotype, morphological or behavioral. A decisive manner to expose a genetic component to some attribute is to show that a variant of the attribute is heritable, From Mendel's success showing that yellow versus green seed color was heritable through current efforts to show susceptibility</page><page sequence="11">42 to cancer is heritable, success implies some genetic underpining. Consider a single locus system with two alleles. In effect, heritabil- ity shows that increasing the frequency of the first allele in an organism from 0, to 1, to 2 copies (for a diploid organism) causes an increase or decrease in the phenotype in question. The actual defini- tion of heritability rests on a procedure to factor the variation in the phenotype into two components, one due to alterations in the number of copies of one allele present in the organism, and a residual variance reflecting the environment, dominance relations, etc. In brief, herita- bility is roughly a measure of the partial derivative of the phenotype with respect to the genotype. How is such a heritability analysis likely to fare with Ashby's machine. That is, take otherwise identical copies of his machine and systematically vary parameter i, holding it fixed for all times in each such copy, then examine the dynamical behavior of the Env-R system. Obviously, due to the enormously history dependent bifurcations of dynamical behavior in the Env-R system as other parameters S change, or as the system is driven by external noise among the basins of attrac- tion of its behavioral repertoire for any one fixed value of the para- meters, the variation in the behavior of the Env-R system will be enormous. A heritability analysis, which is a factor analysis of the variance attributable to theith parameter, and the remainder variance due to other parameters and environmental perturbations will show virtually no heritability with respect to the ith parameter. In short, the behavior varies so dramatically in Ashby's adapting machine, that we will pick up no measurable heritability. On the other hand, suppose we pick as our phenotype, the values of one of Ashby's essential variables. Then the construction of his entire machine subserves the purpose of keeping that variable within very narrow survival bounds. That particular phenotype is very highly buffered by the entire system, such that alterations in any single parameter, or the environment, can be countered by alterations in other parameters. We will measure, in short, a constant phenotype with respect to variations in the gene i, and with variations in the environment. Hence, we will see no variance attributable to gene i. Thus, it will appear that gene i has no bearing on the phenotype in question. Yet in both the above cases, we know that gene i does indeed play a role in both the dynamics of the Env-R system and in maintaining the essential variables within survival bounds. The summary of this part of our discussion, is that when we are concerned with the behavior of a complex, integrated dynamical system, such as a behaving organism, failure to establish heritability of a phenotype proves virtually nothing about whether or not the genome plays a role in determining the phenotype in question. Therefore, it should not surprise us to learn that Sociobiologists have had a difficult time establishing through standard heritability analysis, that specific aspects of human behavior have a genetic basis. Critics of Sociobiology would like to use this current failure as potent grounds to</page><page sequence="12">43 dismiss the efforts of Sociobiologists entirely. I think this example should help make us more sympathetic to their problem. Thus we come to the conclusion that when heritability analysis succeeds, a genetic basis for the phenotype is assured. When it fails, what other avenues are open to the Sociobiologist? It is Panglossian, but hopefully true, that ultimately, the input-output techniques of transmission genetics will be replaced by the actual working out of how the human organism functions. Then we will know how a given gene influences behavior. The limitations of heritability analysis are the limitations of blackbox, input-output analysis in complex systems; in principle, a white box analysis can succeed. Lacking such a deep, detailed understanding, we must ask what alternatives exist to heritability analysis. Ashyby's example allows us to say that parameters constrain or shape behavior. Consider identical small hills, onto which rain falls. The detailed pattern of rivulettes which form may not be predictable from the shape of the hills, but statistical features as the typical number of river systems and their distance from one another may be predictable. In short, perhaps if the right level question is posed, the constraints imposed by the hill shape can be observed. Then the task is to try to get at such constraints in human behavior. The analysis of unlearned behavior in humans obviously offers itself for analysis of the genetic basis of behavior. For we have only two classes of hypotheses for transmission of behavioral patterns, genetic, and cultural. Unlearned behavior by default is almost certainly transmitted genetically. There are numerous examples of wired in behavior. We now know that the visual receptor fields in cats, monkeys, and presumably man, respond to complex geometric stimuli, although visual experience can modify such complex neural units. Were logical atomism an adequate epistomology, we could imagine that McCulloch and Pitts' logical calcu- lus using such simple receptors could represent all our knowledge. Indeed some very good neurophysiologists maintain just this view. What- ever the adequacy of the extended claim may be, the forms of our perception are markedly constrained by computations at the retinal, and superficial cortical levels. The reticular formation is an antique neural structure which serves the function of arousing the cortex. It now begins to appear that the function of the reticular formation is to process incomplete sensory input in emergency situations and make rapid executive decisions among a very small number of alternative behaviors - fight, flee, feed, copulate... This response pattern in humans and animals shows remarkable parallelisms; sufficient to allow our recog- nition of those behavior patterns in many vertebrates. Where unlearned behavior is concerned, it seems clear that comparisons between related species and arguments for a genetic basis to</page><page sequence="13">44 the behavior are perfectly reasonable. Thus, one has the anecdotal impression that facial gestures and body language in higher primates and man are very similar. Are there respectable ways to attempt to extend the analysis of a genetic basis for unlearned behaviors into the realm of learned behaviors? I believe there are at least two, in addition to the hope of heritability analysis. We might expect that organismic, genetic determination of learned behavior would show up as constraints in the patterns of learned responses, if we can but find the right level. There are now numerous glimmerings of such levels. Tinbergen long ago studied imprinting in animals and showed that naive youngsters would adopt a narrow range of stimuli as mother substitutes. The entire notion of rapid imprinting to such a restricted range of stimuli has strongly suggested a wired in constraint on the range of stimuli which would be recognized and learned as "mother". Piaget has shown a developmental sequence in a child's capacity to learn such concepts as symmetry groups, conservation of mass and so on. This evidence for maturation in capacity to incorporate concepts suggests a maturation of a "deep structure" which is partially wired in, and constrains the ontogeny and form of our concepts. Perhaps the most exciting recent development in this area is Chomsky's work suggesting that underlying the superficial phonemic and syntactic structure of language is a "deep structure" to all human language. That children crystallize language so rapidly strongly suggests that standard mechanisms of learning random associations cannot account for acquisition of linguistic competence. Instead, perhaps a wired in deep structure of language is present which constrains the ways we can find to invent symbols to refer, and formulate referential sentences. The analysis of aphasic and dyslexic patients points in the same direction. Carl Jung long ago analyzed the childrens' tales of many cultures and showed that they exhibit an astonishing uniformity of symbols. He postulated that these symbols are part of the "collective unconscious", wired in symbols whose clash and collaboration, coupled with their emotional elaborations, would underlie much of unconscious psychic life. While those ideas seemed odd when formulated, they do not seem so improbable in the light of potential deep structures to language, and the data on imprinting. All these are examples of what seem to be unlearned "inherent ideas" which constrain our further formulation of concepts, our categorization of the world, or the ways we move in it. In short, we may be able to discover a rather wide range of constraints in the pattern of learned behaviors. Note that nothing in these examples demands that the constraints be universal in humans. That is, we need posit no universal human nature. Were the population dimorphic with respect to the order of learning symmetry and conservation of mass, we could still feel that there were good grounds to suspect that the capacity to form these concepts was wired in and matured. There is yet another approach to the study of learned human responses, fully embodied in cultural transmission, which offers the hope of establishing that those behaviors have a genetic basis. The</page><page sequence="14">45 approach, exemplified by Dr. Alexander ([1], [2]) depends upon having some hypothesis about the way behavior will evolve. In Alexander's case, he has chosen a strict Darwinian selectionist maxim - behavior will evolve to maximize reproductive success. He brings to bear the ideas of reciprocal altruism, nepotism, and parental molding to an analysis of human kinship and incest taboos. For example, in cultures which are highly polygynous, certainty of paternity is low. Thus a man's closest known genetic relatives in the next generation will be his sister's children. In monogamous societies, certainty of paternity is high. If organisms behave to maximize their reproductive success, that is, the representation of their genes in subsequent generations, then the theory predicts that in polygynous societies goods and inherited wealth should pass from mother's brother to children, not from father to children; but in monogamous societies, inheritance of wealth should be patrilineal. The prediction, and many like it are confirmed. To the extent that many such cultural patterns can be shown to vary in ccrrelated ways as would be predicted by Darwinian narrow selectionist precepts, we must become impressed with the possibility that selection on a genotype has favored the evolution of such cultural patterns. Of course, the caveat is required that in order to claim that such predictive success points to genetically heritable underpinings for those behaviors, we will need good grounds to rule out the possibility that cultural evolution with selection pressures on the cultural form, would not yield the same behavioral outcome. In the absence of an adequate theory of cultural evolution, it is hard to know now, how to address this difficulty. A similar example is due to John Maynard Smith, who has applied a version of game theory to ask whether, in a conflict situation for some concrete good, there is an evolutionary stable strategy for the frequency and duration with which members of a species should fight one another. The answer for a simple case is yes. Were a more powerful result available, it would be fascinating to show that the distribution of probabilities of fighting durations in humans, say small children, fit the expectations. Before, closing, I would like to defend Sociobiology from certain criticisms [6]. It has been claimed that Sociobiology must posit a universal human nature. I do not see why. Nor need Sociobiology assert that every behavior is biologically heritable, only that some are in some respects. Nor need Sociobiology assert that every behavior is adapted for maximal reproductive success. If some are, that is interesting and important. Nor are arguments from homology with higher primates maliciously anthropomorphic for unlearned responses. Indeed, even for learned behavior patterns it could be argued that there is nothing malicious in utilizing our own cultural knowledge to aid in understanding the behavior of another species close to our own. If there is no neutral way to understand another human culture, but we must import our own culture to the investigation of a second culture, then we come to feel we understand the second when we have obtained a coherent, consistent picture of its functioning. The same happens when</page><page sequence="15">46 we attempt to understand the behavior of higher primates. That we succeed is prima facia evidence of strong homologies in our behavior patterns, not our inventiveness in imposing our categories on other organisms. Similar efforts would fail with an analysis of a hydra colony. Nor need the core terms of Sociobiology be so slippery and open to distortion that its predictions are not open to disconfirmation. Dr. Alexander's presentation in this symposium is an example of testable implications of such hypothesis. On the other hand, critics [6] seem to me to be right that any simple argument about cultural differences among humans reflecting quantitative genetic differences is, at this stage, extremely dubious.</page><page sequence="16">47 References [1] Alexander, R.D.
