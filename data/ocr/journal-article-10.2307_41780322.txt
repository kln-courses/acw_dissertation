For many ancient writers and some modern excavators, Homer s kings and warriors were based on historical figures who set out for Troy from the citadels that still bear their ancient names - Pylos, Tiryns, Argos, Thebes, and chief among them, Mycenae* Not surprisingly, archaeologists have focused their efforts on uncovering evidence of the elite society ruled by kings, including Agamemnon at Mycenae and Nestor at Pylos* But one energetic young scholar is turning away from the kings and focusing on the regular people of ancient Mycenae* Despite more than a century of excavation at Mycenaean palace sites, no one has ever excavated a Mycenaean town* Christofiiis Maggidis and his team are determined to change that* If he succeeds, questions about Search for the Mycenaeans Closing in on the people and towns of Homer's Greece by Jarrett A* Lobell Mycenae and other palace sites thought to be similar in sociopolitical organization, can be addressed for the first time* How did trade function outside the strict commercial system regulated by the palace? What was day-to-day social and economic life like? What kind of houses did the Mycenaeans live in and what did they eat? We know that the Mycenaean elite flourished thanks to their control of rich farm- land and ample food supplies, which were protected by rugged mountain ranges* At sites across Greece, excavators have found massive fortification walls built high on citadels surrounding impressive palaces* These royal residences are filled with elabo- rately decorated rooms featuring brightly colored frescoes fit for royal banquets and receptions* Huge storerooms also found on the citadels speak to the abundance of goods needed for an opulent royal household* At some Mycenaean sites, archaeologists have found rooms crammed with fragments of tablets that record a well- organized and extensive economy controlled by the palaces (see "Linear B," page 34)* And at many sites, rock-cut chamber tombs and stone-built tholos (beehive-shaped) tombs containing stunning gold masks, bronze weapons and armor, and imported gems and pottery create a picture of an impressive elite society* But a civilization like this, which controlled large areas of land, waged long and costly wars, created both land and sea trans- port systems to support long-distance trade, and amassed great quantities of luxury goods, could not do with only kings and warriors* Maggidis, director of the Dickinson College Excavation Project and Survey in Mycenae, View of the Chavos Valley from the citadel of Mycenae.

The 40-year-old Maggidis began working at Mycenae six years ago with his mentor Spyros lakovides, director of the site since the 1980s* But even when he was working up on the citadel, he always had his mind on the valley below, what he confidently calls the Lower Town* "Ever since lakovides told me to walk all around Mycenae for two solid weeks in 1993, to get to know every stone, every rise in the land, to take in the view from high on the sur-</page><page sequence="4">Building K, a large storeroom Í k B Wjt , Bfigurine ■also destroyed b.c. nonstick fin on Left: the anthropomorphic found citadel. around A of frying Mycenaen on the the "psi" Below: 1200 pan , b.c.

Many scholars, including a long line of excavators of Myce- nae - Christos Tsountas in the nineteenth century, Alan J, B. Wace in the mid-twentieth century, George Mylonas in the 1960s - have argued that there may not have been any large urban centers around Mycenae or the other Mycenaean pal- aces* Instead, they suggest that the citadels were surrounded by small countryside settlements loosely connected by the system of roads and highways that developed after 1400 b.c. But Maggidis insists that towns did exist and that they have not been found because up to now, relatively few loca- tions outside of the citadel walls have been explored* "The Linear B tablets from Pylos do seem to indicate that there were urban centers of some sort [see "Linear B " page 34]. We just have not really been looking for them," Maggidis says emphatically "Excavating in Mycenae is really our best chance to find a Mycenaean town." There is some ongoing effort at several of the other palace sites, but - with the exception of promising work at the fortified site of Gla in northwestern Greece - it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for these projects to find Mycenaean towns. After almost 70 years of American excavations at Pylos, focusing mainly on the palace, the town has not yet been discovered. German excavators at Tiryns are struggling to find the Mycenaean town. Before the construction of a Mycenaean dam in about 1220 b.c., the Megalo Rema River had deposited as much as 9 feet of alluvial deposits on top of what the excavators believe to be the large thirteenth-century b.c. town surrounding the citadel at Tiryns. Excavation is impossible at both Thebes, where the modern town sits atop most of the ancient site, and in Athens, where any evidence of a possible Mycenaean town below the Acropolis is covered by a city of over 3.5 million people. 32 ARCHAEOLOGY • January/February 2008</page><page sequence="6">The north and south walls of the rear room of the megaron building, as detected by gradiometer readings, top left; ground- penetrating radar, top right; and excavation, right. " The Linear B tablets from Pylos do seem to indicate that there were urban centers of some sort We just have not really been looking for them " To get a sense of the areas settlement patterns before exca- vation began, Maggidis and Antonia Stamos of the Institute for Aegean Prehistory initiated an intensive investigation into the valley south of the citadel During the 1990s, the Athens Archaeological Society and the British School at Athens con- ducted an extensive surface archaeological survey of all the visible remains in an almost 80-acre area around Mycenae* Eventually, they were able to identify and map more than 750 visible sites, including structures, buildings, towers, remains of walls, tombs, roads, and bridges» With the results of this survey as a framework, Stamos and Maggidis designed a plan to locate the invisible remains using geophysical prospecting and remote sensing* For the first time, the team also used aerial photographs taken in 1988 by the Greek Military Geographical Service that showed dozens of ghost traces of walls all over the area* They combined this with the ERDAS system, geospatial imaging software used by many militaries to locate bunkers and underground missile silos, to create a model of the site* The model showed that the entire valley was likely to contain subsurface archaeological material and made it the most promising area for more survey and future excavation* From 2002 to 2006 Stamos and her team conducted a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey of more than six acres of the valley* The results showed a variety of wall corners, struc- tures, gates, and roads at two distinct levels across the grid, leading Stamos to propose a Hellenistic level dating from the early third to mid-second century b*c*, with structures along a northwest-southeast orientation at a depth of 1 to 2*5 feet* Under this, Stamos has identified the Mycenaean level of occupation oriented to a north-south axis at 2*5 to 8 feet m| below the surface* Maggidis explains that the different orientations of the site indicate that while the Mycenaean buildings were aligned parallel to the Mycenaean road (the GPR survey also identified a substantial segment of this road along with two of its gate tow- ers), the Hellenistic structures faced a theater that was built sometime in the early third to mid-second century b*c* After she analyzed the results of the GPR survey, Stamos, a veteran of survey projects all over Greece, felt the team was onto something big/' I believe that the number, size, type, and spatial distribution of the buildings and features we have found so far supports the possibility of a sizeable Mycenaean urban center,' * she says* "Its possible that it extends as much as 30 hectares [72 acres]*" Currently Stamos is combining her results with electrical resistivity, magnetometry, and geoacoustical surveys done by her team and others, to begin to create a 3-D digital model of what Maggidis hopes will be Mycenae's buried Lower Town* The true test of a survey s success comes when the trowels start pulling away layers of soil and seeing what is actually underneath* "Given the importance of the site, we had to do everything perfectly from square one," says Maggidis* So he began by buying land the team wanted to excavate, using money raised from a private donor and matching funds from Dickinson College* Other projects in Greece have run into www.archaeology.org</page><page sequence="7">v ; From top: Terracotta female figurine of the Early Archaic i period found in the megaron, : Hellenistic coin from nearby Argos pierced for use as a : pendant, and a stone pendant bearing the incised symbol of a sun disc found in the megaron. ||||||i SHE II 9 I ¡¡HIß I saraHl Sil IBlll In Carl Palace 1939, Biegen of a Nestor team began from in to the excavate the southwest University a Mycenaean of of the Cincinnati Greek site mainland called led the by Carl Biegen began to excavate a Mycenaean site called the Palace of Nestor in the southwest of the Greek mainland near the modern town of Pylos* By good fortune, the first trench they laid down went right through the middle of the Archive Room, a storeroom filled with hundreds of clay tablets baked solid by the fires that destroyed the palace at the end of the thirteenth century b.c. The tablets were identi- fied as containing Linear B, an early form of ancient Greek* Additional fragments were soon found at Mycenae, Tiryns, and Thebes* When taken together with the Linear B tablets from Knossos discovered by archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans in the early 1900s, the language was recognized as the lingua franca of the Mycenaean palaces* Since Linear B was deciphered in the 1950s, more than 4,600 tablets and fragments have been translated, and we now know that they are primarily lists of people, animals, produce, and manufactured goods* Linear B seems to have been a language used for bureaucratic and administrative purposes, not private or artistic endeavors like history, philosophy, or poetry for which the later Greek language would be so richly employed* Missing too are the trea- ¡ ties, diplomatic correspondence, and religious texts M known from the extensive archives of royal tablets at JK sites in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia* The Linear B tablets also do not appear to have been intended for long-term storage, and were only preserved by the accident of fire that destroyed the palaces where they were kept* At Mycenae archaeologists have found no trace of an exten- sive archive* In 1952 A* J* B* Wace found a collection of tablets in several large houses outside the citadel walls thought to have been occupied by members of the royal household, and a few badly damaged tablets have been found scattered inside the city walls, mainly in workshops and storerooms* Some scholars have suggested that the archives were destroyed by time and weather, while others say that perhaps Schliemann à threw away great quantities of the tablets thinking they ■ were simple pottery sherds* But Maggidis hasn't given up m hope* "One- third of the citadel has never even been exea- ■ vated down to the still-sealed Mycenaean level, so they H might be there* Or they may be in the Lower Town, in II one of the many large storeroom-type buildings we have H located with our geoprospection survey* Someday we will H find the Linear B tablets from Mycenae to break the loud silence of the archaeological record*" - JAL To read more about the decipherment of Linear B, H visit www.archaeology.org. H difficulties when landowners would not sell, essentially ending research at a site* But Vlassis Cosmopoulos, a guard at the much-visited citadel of Mycenae, paved the way for future acquisitions by selling his property to the state and encouraging others to do the same* Although the land is a protected archaeological zone, the Greek government didn't have the money to buy it, and relied on the project to provide the funds to purchase the site* The government then granted permission for Maggidis to excavate there under the auspices of the Athens Archaeo- logical Society, of which he is a member* Stamoss predictions of the presence of archaeological remains proved remarkably accurate once the digging began, and everyone is eager to move quickly* Standing with his arms crossed looking over the site at each trench, Andreas Tentzeris, the tanned and always-smiling dig foreman and Maggidiss right-hand man says, "When I was growing up in Mycenae, I really did not I IK I !

It will be about five years before the team is able to reach the Mycenaean settlement layers underneath. possibly for firing pottery; They also found a large number of small artifacts, including coins, figurines, stone tools, obsidian blades, arrowheads, animal bones, black-glazed pottery, and several fragments of human infant bones, perhaps remains of child burials once interred under house floors or thresholds in the late third or early second century b,c. The team also began to excavate a large rectangular building of the megaron type that may belong to the Archaic settlement destroyed by the inhabitants of nearby Argos after the Persian War in about 470 b.c. In the building they found early sixth-century pottery imported from Corinth, a talisman stone decorated with a sun, and two figurines of the late seventh or early sixth century b.c. In his first year of excavation at the site, Maggidis decided that he would not dig through any floor layers that they find, explaining, "Next year we need to go into the destruction layer of the floor here to find out what this huge building was - we may have the most important Archaic building ever discovered in Mycenae," says Maggi- dis with obvious excitement. The only other major Archaic building at the site is the so-called Agamemnoneion, a shrine excavated by Wace. And just underneath the Hellenistic and Archaic structures, well protected by a sterile layer, and sealed over by only a foot of clean, red soil lie the tantalizing Myce- naean remains. Maggidis acknowledges that it will probably take about five more years before he gets to the Mycenaean level, and he constantly reminds his students that while the Archaic and Hellenistic levels may not be as compelling as the Mycenaean one, it is important to try to understand how this site changed in more than 1,000 years of habitation. But Maggidis himself is not quite able to wait, and next year will dig two trenches all the way down to the bedrock to find the level of the Mycenaean phase. For 2007 it is Maggidis and his teams last day of digging. On most excavations, the last day is chaos, but here the well- oiled system and knowledge of a long future of excavations ahead keeps things relatively orderly and calm. But even Maggidis cant hide his own excitement. "I think when we reach the Mycenaean levels here it will be a revelation to us all when we compare what we find to the historical sources and Linear B tablets. For the first time we will really understand the spatial and economic relationships between the urban center and the palace. This is what I am really after, not just the frescoes and tombs." It is an enormous undertaking, but one that Maggidis clearly relishes. In a loud voice reserved to get everyone's attention, Maggidis calls an end to the day and reminds everyone to finish up quickly and then, smiling broadly, announces, "Next year, wider and deeper!" ■ Jarrett A* Lobell is a senior editor at Archaeology* www.archaeology.org 35</page></plain_text>
