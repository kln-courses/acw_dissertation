I am grateful also to Peter Levi, who suggested the subject, and to David Lewis, who imparted much Attic knowledge and saved me from many careless mistakes in the field of epigraphy - always so dangerous to the unwary. My examiners had many helpful suggestions for improvement: I am sorry that it is no longer possible to thank Lilian Jeffery in person, but I hope that Robert Parker will accept my gratitude for many stimulating discussions both at the time of examination and afterwards. For kind assistance with points too various to mention I am indebted to David Bain, Judith Binder, John Boardman, Andrew Green, Alan Griffiths, Nicholas Purcell, Jeffrey Rusten, Albert Schachter, John Wilkins and Nigel Wilson. Others who helped with specific points are, I hope, acknowledged in the text. Many institutions gave practical help. For financial support while research was in progress I thank the Craven Committee of the University of Oxford and to St Hilda's College in the same university. During the same period I was also much helped by the facilities offered by the British School at Athens. The transformation from thesis to book occurred on the word- processor of the Departments of Greek and Latin, University College London, and I am extremely grateful to the members and secretaries of these departments for their unstinting help, especially in allowing me to continue to use the machine after I had ceased to be employed in the college. Technical alterations were made at the Institute of Classical Studies, where my debts are many: to John Barron, who agreed to publish the book and gave continuing support and practical help during its preparation; to Alicia Totolos, who likewise gave practical help of most varied kinds; to Jennifer March, who minimised the effects of my incompetence with computers and who prepared the final stages of the manuscript; and to Pat Connolly, who endured with good humour my repeated invasions of her office. Finally, Richard Rutherford helped with the burden of proof-reading. For permission to publish photographs I must thank: National Archaeological Museum, Athens; Epigraphical Museum, Athens; Museo Civico Archeologico, Bologna; Soprintendenza ai beni culturali e ambientali, Siracusa; Soprintendenza archeologica delle province di Napoli e Caserta, Napoli; and the Trustees of the British Museum. I should also like to thank Professor J. McK. Camp for permission to quote some words from the unpublished inscription Agora I 7396. But above all I should like to thank my friends and family, who during the whole period of the book's preparation made life worth living. ix</page><page sequence="4">ABBREVIATIONS Works cited in abbreviated form ABV J.

Because I haven't a clue.'1 Modern scholars, with a purpose very different from that of the ancient satirist, have posed essentially the same question, and the terms of the hero's reply, éÇ àvûpomou xi Kai ůeoú crúvťtexov ('a sort of compound of human being and god'), are echoed in their statements on the relation of hero to god and to human being. 'Les Grecs n'ont jamais douté que leurs Héros avaient été des hommes.'2 'The hero was a spirit of the dead who even when alive possessed powers far surpassing those of any ordinary mortal.'1 'The term heros often meant "minor deity" and not "man who lived and died and subsequently received veneration." '* 'The two factors, dead man and daimon, that go to the hero's making are ... inextricably intertwined.'5 'En fin de compte, le héros est un "démon" indigène qui s'incarne dans un mort puissant.'6 Faced with such varied conclusions, one's first reaction is to echo Menippos' bafflement: ó ļiiļie avúpomóç eaxiv, áx; &lt;pnç, jitļTe ůeóq, Kai cruva|x&lt;póxepóv éaxiv;7 - "The heroes are highly disparate',8 - 'ein sehr bunte und gemischte Gesellschaft'.9 Most studies, until relatively recently, have seen the problem of the hero in the terms suggested above, and the hero emerges either as a powerful dead man, or as a minor local god; or different heroes may be placed in different categories. That heroes were normally regarded as the powerful dead cannot seriously be questioned; their mythology, their cults, centring often round a grave, even more the heroisation of historical characters like Brasidas and Sophocles, all point in this direction. But there are also cases where fípcaç or, more often, f|p&lt;oivr| can only with difficulty be referred to a being once human. 10 Early approaches had often as their aim the reduction of all heroes, at least in some hypothetical original state, to one or other of these categories; they had then to explain the admixture of the other concept. Farnell, with his somewhat arbitrary seven categories of hero, made a very useful contribution by pointing out systematically that many apparently different types could be accommodated in the term 'hero'." Since then, most scholars have been content to accept that the category is wide and fluid, containing a collection of very diverse characters. An alternative approach views the hero as middle term of a series: What god, what hero, what man? Phrases of this sort seem to have become commonplace by the late fifth century, when we find such stereotyped expressions as oiixe ôeobç oiiû' fípoxxç oüx' àvdpáwtouç aìoxwMoa.12 The hero as intermediate being has, oddly, been little discussed recently, 1 Lucian, Dial. mort. 340: àXXa jcpòç rrjç |iavnKfjç, xi ó rípcoç écrri v; àyvoâ yóp. 2 P.

I</page><page sequence="9">2 THE HEROES OF ATTICA although this concept may provide a significant clue to his raison d'être. Vemant," though perhaps a little too schematic in his view of a celestial hierarchy and in his distinction between an 'official' and a 'philosophical' view of this structure, is right to emphasize in passing the position of the hero between god and man; these intermediate categories, including also certain rather vague daimones, are one very important factor in the later developments of heroisation and apotheosis. But this is a model which has remained in the background as far as the major writings on the hero are concerned. Farnell's closely analytical approach was challenged by Brelich, whose book was based on the premise that thus seeking out the differences among the heroes and classifying them is of limited use.14 He sought instead, by producing a 'morphology of the hero', to show what factors unite this seemingly disparate group. His results, therefore, do not readily admit of a summary, but it is apparent that the general method is a fruitful one. Instead of searching for a set of simple formulas in one of which each hero can be encapsulated, we are now faced with a variable pattern, composed of similar elements in perhaps different combinations. Indeed, earlier studies have concentrated too exclusively on the problem of origins, assuming this to be the ultimate question which, when answered, will throw the all- important light on the cult of heroes. The problem of role and function is surely equally important. The cult of the hero, as distinct from that of the ancestor, seems to be a phenomenon more or less peculiar to Greek societies. What function, then, does the class of heroes fulfil which is either not necessary, or taken by some other class, among other groups? For there are clearly enough common features among heroes to suggest with a fair degree of probability that there are also common functions shared by all or a majority. In this connexion the question depreciated at the outset by Brelich - What is the difference between heroes and gods? - once again becomes important. True, it is often difficult to distinguish between hero and god, particularly at a functional level; true, there are instances where the same being may be indifferently referred to as iļpa*; or ûeôç: but a serious distinction is made quite often enough to be significant. For Homer, fipox; is simply a title of respect applicable to rulers and to warriors of the highest class. The etymology of the word is unclear, but a basic sense of 'lord' is appropriate enough both for this usage and for that prevailing elsewhere, referring to the cult hero. 15 Post-Homeric usages of the word, down to the end of the fourth century when great changes were making themselves felt, show a puzzling dichotomy in views of the heroes. Setting apart those occurrences of the word which are obviously influenced by epic diction, we find on the one hand that heroes may be invoked with gods as guardians of an oath or institutors of customs,16 or alternatively they may appear in a far less dignified light as very minor, local powers, often capricious and usually affecting mankind for the worse.17 If with Menippos we are puzzled as J.-P.

See further pp. lOff.</page><page sequence="10">PRELIMINARIES 3 to what a hero actually is, it seems that the Greeks of the classical period were equally puzzled as to what he does. We are on slightly firmer ground when we consider what the worshippers did for the hero, and indirectly of course this may shed light on how they regarded him. The characteristic features of hero-cult have often been enumerated and discussed.1" 'Evayíonóç rather than ťhxria, worship at a tomb, the total burning of the victim rather than its consumption by the worshippers, are all phenomena found more commonly in the cult of heroes than in that of gods. But whereas some heroes display these and other features of worship very far removed from those usual in the cult of the Olympian gods (and some, mostly late, authors are keen to stress the differences as much as possible),19 in other cases such features seem to be minimal or non-existent. Perhaps the most usual distinguishing feature is the cult action at a tomb, real or supposed; this is in obvious contrast to divine worship, with only a very few exceptions which were considered bizarre in the classical period. Indeed a strong current of thought and practice separated death from divine worship as far as possible.20 The physical presence of the hero, identified with his body, is thus important, and there is good evidence from the early sixth century onwards for the importance attached to heroic relics. On the other hand, heroes coulH be worshipped even when their bones were thought to be elsewhere; it is unclear whether this is a later development or whether it has independent roots in the concept of the hero as able to move round at will.21 Certainly, the latter is implied by several of the stories of heroes appearing in battle, some of which are contemporary with the most marked period of the cult of relics. But most heroes, nevertheless, continue to be worshipped at a tomb, and related to this is the fact that each hero has far fewer places of worship than a god, even if we take 'a god' to mean a particular aspect of a god indicated by an epithet. Zeus Meilichios and Aphrodite Ourania were worshipped in dozens of places all over the Greek world. No hero (with a few exceptions of ambiguous rank, like Herakles) could claim that. Even the most extreme and puzzling cases of multiple graves, like that of Oedipus, could muster (say) only four or five cult-places in three different areas of Greece; two tombs are far more usual, while the vast majority of heroes have only one. Consequently we can at least affirm that compared with most gods, the hero has a far more limited and local significance, though that of course does not preclude his being very important indeed in that limited setting. In general, however, cult- practice suggests that the hero normally occupies a lower rank than the god. His shrine is as a rule far less elaborate, the victims offered to him less expensive. This corresponds to one constant feature observable in the literary evidence, which we have seen before: that heroes are referred to in connexion with gods and regularly follow, not precede them. Often, indeed, we find a hero shrine as a subordinate part of a divine sanctuary, the hero receiving a preliminary and lesser sacrifice before the climactic offering to the god. The form of offering in the two cases is often quite different. The process of evayíaiióç seems to have been described early and quite fully by Kleidemos; the surviving fragment makes it clear that a hero is envisaged as recipient or object of the sacrifice.22 The ritual described is clearly apotropaic and quite '* Still perhaps most fully in E. Rohde, Psvche , edn. 9/10 (1925) 148-50. " E.g. Arrian, Anabasis 4. 1 1 .3; an example in Paus. 2. 1 1 .7. It is a standard provision of sacral laws that contact with death confers a certain degree of ritual impurity: see R. Parker, Miasma (Oxford 1983) 32-40. Paus. 5.13.3 shows that this could sometimes be extended to the point where contact with a hero renders the worshipper unfit to approach a god. 21 Wilamowitz, Der Glaube der Hellenen II p. II. maintains that the strong emphasis on bones and graves is a sixth- century development encouraged by Delphi. This may be true in a narrow sense, but does not preclude an early stress on physical presence. See also n. 29. 22 Fr. I Tresp = FGrH 323 F 14.</page><page sequence="11">4 THE HEROES OF ATTICA different from the practice and concept implied in the strict usage of the word ťhxria. But quite apart from the widening of this word, particularly in later times, to include évayíafióç, the simple equation god - ducia: hero - evayíofióç is clearly inadequate. Chthonic or sinister gods often receive evaYíanóç; the locus classicus is Pausanias 8.34.3, where we hear, in a mythical context, of évayío^óç to the Maniai (identified by Pausanias with the Eumenides) in their black aspect, and Ovaia to them as white. On the other hand, there is abundant evidence from Attica to show that èvayio|ióç was not universally practised in the worship of heroes.23 The distinction partially corresponds with, but also cuts across, the difference between god and hero. Even in cult-practice, then, it seems that no hard-and-fast rules can be evolved for the hero, but only generalities. Of the facts which emerge, the most broadly applicable would appear to be the local nature of the hero, while the concept of him as a dead person in his tomb is also very common. There is, nevertheless, some overlap with the concept of the god, and it is clear that the two categories, even if separate in origin, had some influence on each other. The essence of the hero is elusive; scarcely less so are his origins. A full discussion of this much-considered question is best postponed to a later stage, but it may be convenient to summarise here some of the main currents of thought. Most accounts (tentatively or less so) place the genesis of the hero round about the eighth century BC, thus roughly contemporary with a number of other major phenomena which had far-reaching effects on the development of Greek society. The first of these to be linked with the rise of the hero, naturally enough, was the diffusion of the epic. It is certainly the case that epic is a potent and continuously present factor in the formation of individual cults, but a theory which invokes it as the principal reason for the origin of the phenomenon in general is not without difficulties. The most striking of these difficulties will, I hope, become apparent during the course of this study, as we examine the various types and roles of the Attic heroes - for it seems to be the case that Attica is one of the areas least fitted to such a view. Other theories link the hero with more general social change. Thus hero-cult may appear as a response to the dispossession of peasants from long- occupied land, or alternatively it may represent an attempt by beleaguered aristocrats to transfer their old privileges to another plane. Any or all of these theories may contain important truths, but all are in need of one major qualification: elements of hero-cult seem to be in existence before the eighth century. Theories must also be considered in the light of the specific, detailed evidence provided by the function of various heroes in society, and finally we must ask ourselves whether what we are trying to explain is really a single phenomenon.24 What follows is a regional study. The reasons for this limitation are not simply negative - we have far more information about Attica than about anywhere else in the Greek world; also, by imposing such limits, it may be easier to gain some impression of the place occupied by this class of beings in one society taken as a whole. Just as one god may have quite different significances in different cities, so heroes and their cults may occupy different areas of the total socio-religious system. We have no guarantee that the case of Attica is typical. But we can still hope that a study of the heroes in Attic society may point some directions for future research. I have also imposed chronological limits, though the distribution of evidence means that it has not always been possible to stick to them rigidly. The period of this study is that in which many aspects of Greek religion are seen in their classic form. The upper limit defines itself: there are scraps of evidence from the eighth century and even earlier which point to hero-cult in 23 W. S. Ferguson, 'The Attic Orgeones', HThR 37 (1944), 61-140, with Nock (n.4: in the same volume). 24 For a fuller discussion with references, see ch. 7.</page><page sequence="12">PRELIMINARIES 5 some form, though not necessarily identical in emphasis with the later phenomenon. The bulk of our evidence comes from the fifth and especially the fourth century, but towards the end of the fourth century a change occurs. Categories receive a shake-up: contemporary mortals can be gods, ordinary and undistinguished people are heroes. Though the old cult of heroes never completely perished, it survived often in an attenuated and reduced form, and by the second century of our era Pausanias can think it worthwhile to comment on the continued practice of cult at a hero-shrine.25 The new heroes, one's own dead family, came to have a greater importance than the heroes of the community at large. To speak thus is of course to generalise over the whole Greek world, although the phenomenon proceeded at different rates and arrived at different times in various areas. It may be that Attica was rather conservative in this respect, and the new usage, at least in verbal terms, was slow to come in here.26 But in Attica too the ordinary dead were now being portrayed in the modes which had been confined to the hero proper.27 What function did these new heroes fulfil? Perhaps we see here an increased emphasis on an aspect of the cult of heroes which was always present, but had not previously been in the foreground. The worship of former human beings can have two aspects: an essentially objective cultus in which they are approached like gods, and a more subjective concentration on the fate of the dead, when the present state of the heroes is of interest as a possible reflexion of the worshipper's own future state. But while the afterlife was a question which had naturally preoccupied Greeks of all periods, this did not necessarily impinge on the cult of the hero. It would seem more natural to concentrate one's hopes for an afterlife either on a reward meted out to all the righteous dead, or on the consequences of a ritual experience such as initiation at Eleusis - where a better fate after death was explicitly promised to candidates.28 Most descriptions of the life of the blessed after death have no clear reference to heroisation. But already in Hesiod (Op. 109-42) we find two groups of beings whose present state as 8aí|xoveç or ixáicapeç (the word fíptoeç is not used) is linked with their past condition as men of the golden or silver race.29 Essentially the same type of schematic description occurs in Pindar (fr. 133 S-M), with the significant modification that here the reference is to a continued process: men of the present will become fípoeç á-yvoí, holy heroes. In this connexion it becomes more plausible to relate to heroisation other Pindaric references to an afterlife (frr. 129-30 S-M; Ol. 2.61ff.). Similar elements are found in the so-called 'Orphic' gold leaves.10 However, Plato in quoting the first passage from Pindar makes it clear that this is not a normally accepted belief; rather it expresses the doctrine of 'those of the priests and priestesses who have taken the trouble to be able to give an explanation of the activities they are engaged in',11 those, that is, who have applied theological speculation to their sacerdotal 25 E.g. 8.4.10 and many other places. 26 So R.

Even these sound rather like a fiction for Plato himself. Pindar himself implies, in complete consistency with his social outlook elsewhere, that only the àyaôoi can expect heroisation; his aristocratic audience is composed precisely of those 'glorious kings and men swift in strength and mighty in wisdom'" who are the heroes. Such men, if they cared to imbibe this view, might perhaps hope to imitate the heroes of the past and to share their blessed state after death, but this was necessarily a limited possibility confined, one supposes, to a few aristocratic circles.11 To the ordinary worshipper, the prospect of his own survival can have had little to do with the beings who conferred small benefits on him, or who were responsible for the terrors of the night. Who ever derived comfort from a belief in ghosts, imagining his own state as he haunted his former house? By and large, the hero was viewed objectively in the classical period; he needed his due as the gods needed theirs, and the idea of the heroes' possible life in the islands of the blest or the Elysian fields, or of the gods' 'easy' existence bore only an oblique relation to the offering of sacrifice. The important thing was the relation of the hero to the worshipper. With the new heroes - insofar as the merely conventional elements can be separated off - different needs are satisfied, and the connexion of heroes with an interest in the afterlife is immensely broadened. When one's own parents or spouse were heroes, speculation on and hopes for the present state of the hero were inevitable; so was concentration on one's own future state. How far this changed emphasis marked the spread of ideas previously confined to exclusive, aristocratic circles and how far it had independent roots lies beyond the scope of this study. But we may note another feature connected with the new heroes: it was presumably more than ordinarily useful to have a member of your family, with your interests at heart, in a powerful position, able to act through more than human channels: "itaxťk Kai noi craaÇe vóotov cckoç qx; to Jt[á]poiť)ev vûv 7«xp deiotepiļv (jofpav è'xeiç ßi0xo[v&gt;] 'Be favourable and grant me healing for my sickness, as you did before, since now you have a kind of life closer to the divine' says a second-century sepulchral inscription from Pergamon.34 In a sense this is related to the old form, the hero as patron of city or group, and yet the tone has become more intimate and more everyday. It is clear that the whole development marks a fundamental change in the concept of the hero. For this reason I have chosen to end this study at a point before the new concept becomes general. It is not possible, however, to eliminate all evidence from the later period; notably, Pausanias is a fertile and useful source of information. Some of the local historians of Attica, too, fall strictly outside the chronological limits, yet it is usually possible to see when their material has a bearing on the earlier period. The sources are of very diverse kinds, and consequently give us widely different types of information. The atthidographers, whose works only exist in fragments (though some are quite extensive), are the authors who are most concerned to give us direct information about heroes and their cults. Their interests tend to be aetiological, and once one has grasped the methodology of their connexions between cult practice and 'historical' fact, it also becomes possible to make deductions about the former from statements about the latter. Largely from an ßaaiXrjec, ayauoi Kai oôevei KpaiJtvoi oo&lt;pią te (leyiatoi avôpeç, fr. 133 S-M. "This difference in emphasis, it seems to me. is one of the significant distinctions between the heroes of the classical period and the Christian saints. Although at the simplest level of Christian piety the saint may be largely a supernatural figure to be coaxed into bestowing favours - the parallel with the hero being obvious - a most important element in the cult of saints has always been the concept of the saint as model to be imitated, an idea with several classical antecedents of a very different sort. Hence by implication the blessed state of the saint can be attained by others. 14 Kaibel 243.7-8.</page><page sequence="14">PRELIMINARIES 7 earlier period tragedy too, especially that of Euripides, often has aetiological interests, and plays set in Attica or with Attic relevance can be extremely illuminating not only for accidental points of detail but for patterns of thought represented - though tragedy is also capable of espousing the more austere Iliadic viewpoint in which the finality of death leaves no room for the cult hero. Though useful at many points, tragedy is considered particularly in chapter 3. Heroes of a less personal, less epic kind were the subject of several comedies (see chapter 2), but for the most part references in comedy, as in oratory, general history and most other prose works, are incidental, though sometimes giving us unexpected insights. Literary productions are supplemented by the visual arts. Vase-paintings can give an idea of a hero's popularity (for example Theseus), and occasionally more recherché information on some of the less well-known heroes; but the immediate source of heroic scenes on vases is at least as likely to be epic or drama as direct input from cult legend or practice. Very different in purpose is the other main type of visual depiction, the votive relief. Such artefacts, by and large, stick to certain well-defined and stereotyped patterns; with a number of (often puzzling) exceptions, they speak to us not so much of individual cults as of the general relationship between god or hero and worshipper. More solid information is usually provided by any accompanying inscription. Indeed, without the contribution made by epigraphy in general, our knowledge of the religious profile of Attica would be immeasurably poorer. Not only votive inscriptions, but boundary-markers, inventories, sacred laws and sacrifice calendars, decrees of the city and of the various groups within the city - all these have their part to play, often a very important part, in building up a picture of heroic cult in Attica. The information they give is normally of a rather formal kind, but even so we can sometimes go beyond this and make deductions about a hero's place in the community. The same limitation applies rather more strongly in the case of archaeological data from those religious sites which yield neither inscriptions nor votives, though even such data can make a contribution. It remains now to indicate some lines of investigation. The function of a hero can only have a meaning in terms of the hero's relationship with his human worshippers, whether with individual or with group. As with other features of the religious system of the Greeks, this double consideration is of crucial importance. Within the chronological limits as sketched above, the hero's relations with the individual are comparatively straightforward. On the whole, the hero is tended with the observances of cult (regular or occasional or both) and he is capable of responding with benefits, sometimes general, sometimes specific, for his worshippers. Sometimes he is a malevolent power to be invoked as an explanation for disaster; sometimes the ritual of his cult has developed to the point where his original function is obscured and forgotten, and his significance shifts from the benefits he can confer on the individual to the function of the ritual as a group performance. In chapter 2, some examples are given of variations on these themes, showing some of the functions relating to individual concerns which heroes can fulfil. Their role in such dealings is very like that of gods; their human past may, perhaps, render them more sympathetic to human plights, but this is scarcely a firm distinction. In its barest outlines, this type of transaction with gods and heroes is one which is easy to apprehend, springing as it does from the deity's power to grant the individual's basic wishes - health, prosperity and so on. But there is another and perhaps more spectacular way in which gods and heroes can be approached: by the group, acting in concert. This is the basis of the festival, that most conspicuous part of ancient religious practice, and involves factors other than those outlined above, although such group worship may also provide an occasion for individual piety. These</page><page sequence="15">8 THE HEROES OF ATTICA relations are more difficult to analyse, being composed of many strands and offering many variables, the most obvious being the many different groups which characterise Greek society. Although, as I shall argue, the cult of the hero is of particular significance to the group, this basic distinction can be applied to all phenomena of Greek religion, and probably of any religious system. All this of course is well known, and not only to sociologists of religion. It is easy to gain at least an impression of the importance of group religion, the intimate connexion of gods and men in the composition of the city, in archaic and classical Greece, simply by perusing the products of the society, its art and literature. The importance of this connexion has not been without its exponents; there is a direct line from Fustel de Coulanges in the mid- nineteenth century (however mistaken some of the ideas in his classic work)" down to the present day. Both Nilsson and Burkert in their systematic works on Greek religion16 have laid due stress on this aspect of sensibility and practice, and it forms the basis of the extremely important work of Louis Gernet." 'Religion and society' in the ancient world is now beginning to be more widely apprehended as a crucially important area of study, in terms which go beyond the crude concept of political manipulation of cult and myth. Nevertheless, with important exceptions, until very recently religion (as opposed to myth alone) as a group phenomenon has tended to be relatively neglected by writers on the Greeks. While many in the French anthropological school have tended to concentrate on myth, as an expression of collective (usually unconscious) mentality, those scholars whose interests lie more in the conscious thoughts and practices of the Greeks, approached as a historical society, have for the most part adopted a model which emphasizes religion as an experience of the individual. Thus to take an extreme example, Festugière, in his sensitive and often admirable book Personal Religion among the Greeks -w gives us a picture in which 'personal religion' is somehow a higher, more developed phenomenon, something more significant than the religious behaviour of the group. For him, institutionalised religion is essentially this individual piety multiplied by the number of worshippers present on any occasion. The chief significance of this group religion is as a form of witness; observing the piety of so many individuals, those outside may be moved or perhaps converted, and those inside may find reinforcement. Whether or not this is an adequate approach to corporate religion in Christian and other traditions, it clearly does not suffice as a model for Greek religion and society. At least in the period with which we are here concerned, and in many respects long afterwards, religious sentiment and practice are intimately bound up with the city - to take only the most obvious group. What is more, the Greeks themselves were well aware of the function of religion as a marker of corporate identity. Among the factors defining Greekness, Herodotus in a strongly emotional passage (8.144.2) names the possession of common sanctuaries and the use of similar religious rites. The same judgement is implicit in his descriptions of non-Greek peoples and their gods; close to our subject, we may note his observation (2.50) that the Egyptians worship no heroes. To take smaller groups, certain festivals defined what race of Greeks one came from: the Apatouria was a festival common and exclusive to Ionians, as the Karneia to Dorians. The Erechtheion at Athens was claimed as territory forbidden to those of Dorian race (Hdt. 5.72). The designation of certain gods as Polias or Polieus, the existence in each city of 7toX.ioûxot ôeoí, of necessity provided a factor defining citizenship, if not in the technical sense, 35 N-D.

Similarly and perhaps more closely the worship of a particular Apollo Patroös or Zeus Herkeios defined one's membership of certain groups based on kinship or habitation. No less than gods, heroes took their part in forming the self-awareness of the group. Indeed the hero, thought of as a dead man, would often be seen as the more exclusive property of the group which perhaps he championed in life. He might occupy a central position in the city; the agora of city or deme, the chief meeting-place of the community, where each individual would most naturally experience the sense of the group's existence, was usually the site of several heroic cults, most notably often that of the founder or eponymous hero of the place - a burial practice which was, of course, continued in historical times.1* But the Athenian agora - and it is likely to have been typical - was full of minor, perhaps more 'private' heroes as well, as excavations have demonstrated, confirming the picture in the literary sources. What then was the significance of the connexion? To the city as a whole the hero might appear chiefly as protector and benefactor; but there are many other forms of relationship possible, and these come into play particularly perhaps in the case of the smaller groups which were a part of the society of every Greek city - tribe, genos, regional division, and so on. The mere existence of the hero, his cult or the traditions about him, may prove a cohesive force for the group or may help to clarify its image of itself. What, then, were the precise relations possible between heroes and the various groups of Greek society? How did the people of archaic and classical Attica perceive the actions and significance of their heroes for group and for individual? •w Heroes in agoras: R. Martin, Recherches sur l'agora grecque (Paris 1951) 194-201. See also O. J. Broneer, 'Hero-cults in the Corinthian Agora', Hesperia 1 1 (1942) 128-61. Brasidas: Thuc. 5.1 1.1.</page><page sequence="17">2: THE HERO AND THE INDIVIDUAL: SOME FORMS OF RELATIONSHIP Like gods, heroes may concern themselves with almost any aspect of an individual's life. Further, powerful beings of both categories may use their powers for good or ill, as Artemis may give women an easy labour or be a 'lion to women' (Aiovxa yuvaiÇí, //. 21.483). Some gods indeed show this very clearly by a duality of cult, the best-known example being the black and white Maniai connected with Orestes near Megalopolis. Heroes, however, show this double aspect far less obviously than most gods; particular heroes generally had a reputation as kindly or the opposite, and in the case of any given hero people seem to have either expected benefits from him or tried to avoid his unpleasant attentions. In this, the relationship of hero to individual is unlike his relationship with the city: in his civic aspect, the same hero is (necessarily) both beneficial and harmful, as Oedipus is the friend of the Athenians and the enemy of the Thebans. Those heroes more concerned with the affairs of individuals have often more consistent dispositions. A good example is the hero Eumenes (a significant name!) on Chios, who had special connexions with slaves; one might have expected him io favour slaves at the expense of masters (or is this too subversive?) but in fact we are told that he was kind to both, so long as they behaved well.2 On the whole it would seem that in their relationship with individuals heroes can be divided into 'helpful' and, much rarer, 'unpleasant' types. But this is a picture nowhere explicitly drawn in ancient sources. On the contrary, there is in literature a tendency to generalise and speak of 'heroes' as though the characteristics of all were identical. In fact there is a small but emphatic group of references which regard the heroes as malicious powers, 'readier to harm than help' in Menander's words.' This is of course a far from universal view: the "Hptoç in the same Menander's play of that name was probably a benevolent power.4 But it is a view attested more than once in the classical period.5 In particular, the heroes have a habit of visiting their victims with unpleasant diseases, described with all the elaboration of comedy in an interesting fragment of Aristophanes' Heroes , which gives us a third view.6 Here the chorus of heroes say that they are 'the stewards of good and evil events'.7 The rest of the fragment is devoted to a graphic description of the ills which they send to thieves, and it seems fairly clear that the basis of their action is moral. It is not merely offences against the heroes' own due which are punished (as in the case of Anagyros, below) but offences against the accepted morality. It seems likely that since these heroes are also stewards of 'good things', they may conversely send benefits to those who behave well, though this is not stated in the fragment we possess. One should, of course, be wary of taking comic evidence too literally, the moral attitude of the heroes would doubtless have some function in the plot; but the view expressed does not seem too inherently improbable to be based on a real belief, nor is it really difficult to reconcile with the concept of the hero acting for ill in an apparently arbitrary way. The actions of gods, too, towards men are sometimes regarded as motivated by men's moral behaviour, sometimes by some other factor unrelated to human 1 Paus. 8.34.1-3. : Athen. 6.266D-E.

In this case it seems clear, however, that the view expressed in the Heroes is a later development of an unrationalised, 'superstitious' belief in the heroes as arbitrary, malicious powers. What does present some difficulty is the contrast of this type of view with actual practice, which clearly often regarded the hero as capable of bestowing good. Even one of our most emphatic sources for the unpleasantness of heroes attests to the other belief. In the well-known fable (63) of Babrius, we hear of a pious man who, on finding a hero's grave in his courtyard, pours libations at the altar and asks the hero for riches and good things; but the hero, appearing at midnight, tells him that only gods can bestow good things, while heroes are givers of 'all the bad things that have to do with mortals' (Kam mvxa axe oúveoxiv àvôpcímoiç). Though the hero's view of his species is, as we have seen, far from an isolated curiosity, the man's attitude is quite consistent with fifth and fourth century practice. A number of private offerings attest to the practice of the private offering to the local hero, and presumably the practice of garlanding the altar and pouring libations, as in Babrius, would be many times more frequent than the more elaborate offering commemorated with a relief or inscription. Clearly such offerings were not made with an apotropaic purpose; we get a more definite idea of what fourth-century Athenians expected from their heroes from a dedication to one of the many minor heroes of the agora, Kallistephanos.8 In response to a dream, we are told, the palaiourgos Dionysios made a dedication to the hero Kallistephanos, who is enjoined to give in return 'riches and happy health' (nXovxóv xe Kai còaícov' ůyíeiav). The only difference here is the dream; otherwise Dionysios behaves exactly like the man in Babrius. Moreover, the tone of the inscription is sunny and confident, striking a good natured bargain; the use of àvxiSíSco|ii here is paralleled in the sentiments expressed in dedications to Athena on the Acropolis.9 It seems likely that private dedications to other heroés, though they do not state it explicitly, were made in a similar spirit.10 Fairly minor heroes, such as those dotted about the agora," none the less had some 'supernatural' power about them like the gods, and the vast majority of heroes were approached like the vast majority of gods; cautiously indeed, but with little hesitation in asking for favours. Indeed, the neighbourhood hero, like the neighbourhood god, was often a familiar, beneficent figure to those who lived nearby.12 But Babrius' type of hero undoubtedly did exist; quite apart from the view that heroes in general should be feared, there is a fairly well-defined group of heroes who can be classed together as 'unpleasant'. This type has been thoroughly examined by Fontenrose.13 The 8 Agora I 7396; unpublished, but see AJA 11 (1973) 209, and J. McK. Camp, The Athenian agora (London 1986) 147. 9 The archaic examples of this sentiment from the Athenian acropolis and elsewhere are collected in M. L. Lazzarini, Le formule delle dediche votive nella Grecia arcaica (Rome 1976) section 16, pp. 189-92. Most of the Attic examples are dedications to Athena Polias, but there is one to Aphrodite (no. 786) and one to Apollo Zoster (no. 787); cf. also no. 870. There are apparently no archaic dedications of this type to heroes. For the later period IG II2 4319 and 4321, both dedications to Athena, may serve as examples, though this type of formula appears to be on the wane in the fourth century. The chief cause of this may be the far less common use of verse in fourth century inscriptions; the main part of the Kallistephanos inscription, displaying the formula, consists of three hexameters. This decline does not affect the main argument: that exactly the same is expected of Kallistephanos as of a god. Âvxiôoûvai is used of the dead in A.

Studs. 1 (1968) 73-104.</page><page sequence="19">1 2 THE HEROES OF ATTICA unpleasantness is attested only in myth, but it is safe to deduce that these heroes were feared in real life as well. The most usual pattern is that the hero, a man of exceptional achievement, is cheated of some reward, whereupon he reacts with great violence. He is punished, usually killed, by the outraged citizens and in consequence some disaster befalls them. On enquiring of an oracle - the normal procedure in such circumstances - they are told to pay heroic, or even divine, honours to the man they have killed. This is a type which becomes attached in particular to historical Olympic victors; but Fontenrose analyses the different combinations of motifs and shows that other unpleasant heroes are related. Some of these may exhibit only tht bad behaviour without the myth to back it up; this is the type of belief satirised by Lucian, referring to the dead Hippocrates - of all people - as a type of poltergeist. 14 On the other hand, the myth has also connexions with the story of the city's enemy who becomes its benefactor; this type will be considered in the following chapter. But on the individual plane, the only Attic example of the type (as far as we know) is provided by Anagyros or the Avayupáoioç óaijicov. This figure avenged the cutting down of trees in his grove by throwing over the offenders' houses, or else by causing the guilty man's mistress to fall in love with his son, thus precipitating a sort of 'Hippolytus' story ending in the death of all three.15 It is true that any hero might react in this way if his precinct was so blatantly desecrated, and we do not deduce from Callimachus' Sixth Hymn that Demeter is a malevolent goddess. Nonetheless it is remarkable that we do not hear this type of story of any other Attic hero, nor do we know anything else about this one. It is the salient fact about the daimon of Anagyros, which is why the lexicographers chose to relate it. The reason why it is such an important fact is surely that the hero was noticed to have a malevolent effect; the grove was probably a place of ill omen, to be hurried past 'unlooking, unspeaking', like the grove of the Eumenides in Oedipus at Colonus."' The story related is simply a mythic exemplum of the sort of things which might be expected from the hero in the grove. Thus the hero Anagyros begins his career as simply a maleficent phenomenon and gradually acquires some sort of personality as the Ávayupáoioç Saíptov, his most common designation. His more complete 'humanisation' as a hero is later still. The name Anagyros might even seem to suggest that to some people he became the deme's eponymous hero, its fiptoç àpxt|YÉîT|ç but his older nature was not forgotten. A case exactly parallel to this is provided by the heroes or daimones (there is some ambiguity) called Taraxippos at Olympia and at the Isthmus.17 At a certain point in the stadium, horses are often observed to panic and shy for no apparent reason; this is put down to daimonic interference and a character called Taraxippos emerges. A similar phenomenon may even lie behind the perplexing passage in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (230-8) describing horses and chariots at the grove of Poseidon at Onchestos in Boeotia (although many other interpretations have been offered); here there is apparently no hero and the charioteers address their prayers to Poseidon."1 Heroes like Taraxippos are not heroes in the more usual sense; they are not consistently regarded as the powerful dead; but they well illustrate how blurred the lines between categories may be. However, in contrast to Kallistephanos and the others, it is very doubtful whether Anagyros, while he remained a nasty daimon lurking in a grove, received any 14 Lucian, Philopseudes 21. But see E. R. Dodds, The Ancient Concept of Progress (Oxford 1973) 158 n. 1; his doubts do not seem relevant here, however. 15 Suda s.v. Avayupaoioç (Hieronymus). 16 Soph. OC 130: àôepKTOtx;, àcpajviûç.

It will be plain that we are here dealing with two radically different types of hero, or concepts of the hero. We have before us a lot of heroes who may be expected to be helpful; a few heroes from whom nothing but evil may be expected; and a series of general statements to the effect that heroes are a rather unpleasant category of beings. How are these to be reconciled? Obviously the nasty hero is fulfilling quite a different function from the nice hero in the system of popular belief and religious needs in the societies where he belongs. Rather than supplying any positive need, he provides an explanation for the bad things which happen to people (and horses!) This applies both to individual heroes and to the heroes as a group. Sudden illnesses might be treated as caused by heroes; together with Hekáte, another somewhat ambivalent figure, the heroes were especially associated with sudden night panics, according to the author of the Hippocratic treatise 'On the sacred disease'.20 If heroes are blamed, rather than vague malevolent powers, this is a stage in the very common process by which superhuman elements come to be regarded in a more concrete way. The category of heroes, having been created, attracts to itself features which properly belong to other groups, impersonal daimones perhaps, or more ordinary spirits of the dead. This explanation is more convincing than the alternative, that heroes exist primarily as an explanation for unpleasant occurrences. If that were so, it would be very hard to see how, as a general phenomenon, they came to acquire such positive functions, bestowing benefits and acting as patrons of particular groups. A third possibility is that heroes in general, like Hekáte and many chthonic goddesses, have a well-defined double aspect, kindly and sinister. Possibly the Aristophanes fragment is based on such a concept, but if the pattern were general its absence in the picture of any individual hero is surprising. Of course, any superhuman being, as any human, may display beneficence or the opposite, but that is rather a different matter frotr the more sharply delineated double aspect, as often mirrored in cult. Another strand in the concept of the malevolence of the heroes may lie in the idea of divine anger. If gods could be angry with mortals, with disastrous consequences, so in proportion could heroes, on a smaller scale and without epic associations. It was thus perhaps preferable to attribute one's misfortunes to a hero, specified or otherwise, than to a god whose concerns were grander and who might prove more difficult to appease. If we now turn to examine the particular ways in which specific individual heroes act towards the individual worshipper, we find some confirmation for the view that the malicious aspect of heroes is secondary. Heroes with specialised functions in the areas of life's crises and dangers - the heroes dealing with healing, childbirth and seafaring whom we shall now consider - do not seem to act malevolently in those spheres. The purpose of the individual specialists is to give help, not to explain misfortunes. However, there is room for plenty of variation in their modes of action. 19 Taraxippos did indeed acquire the trappings of hero-cult, a YHÇ an(J an altar, at which competitors sacrificed, praying for the daimon's favour. But Pausanias at least did not believe that Taraxippos was a hero: his favoured explanation made the name an epithet of Poseidon. It was necessary to institute sacrifice to Taraxippos because the course, after all, had to be run; there was no such compulsion in the case of Anagyros. so one assumes he received less cult. 20 De morb. sac. 4 ( = Littré VI. 362). The passage attributes to popular belief the assignation in detail of different symptoms to different gods, but when evaluating this as evidence we must not overlook its satirical tone. E. Hipp. 141-50 gives a vaguer and perhaps more plausible version of gods causing illness. These gods may cause illness or may act beneficently; the difference is that unpleasant acts of this nature are the only type of action attributed to heroes as a class.</page><page sequence="21">14 THE HEROES OF ATTICA 1. Healing heroes If heroes in their negative, malicious aspect are frequently to blame for illnesses, they may also be connected with healing, and this is a complex composed of rather different strands. We are here essentially concerned with the individual hero, specialising in cures, to whom the individual turns in cases of need. Of course, almost any god or hero can function as a healing power; this is well brought out in an Attic context by Brelich, using evidence collected in Solders.21 Some of this evidence lies in the specialised area of childbirth, which we shall consider later; but in other cases the god's general power simply qualifies him as a healer.22 The chief deity in a locality will naturally take on a variety of functions not normally associated with him - and in the nature of human needs, healing is sure to be prominent among those functions. So Pindar represents himself as going to his local shrine of the Mother in order to pray for Hieron's recovery.21 Nevertheless, the gods and heroes of Attica who deal particularly with healing form a substantial group, and it would scarcely be surprising if fresh evidence were to reveal the existence of further healing cults. How, then, are we to account for the existence of these specialists? On one level it is clear that shrines like anything else are subject to fashion, and reports of miracle cures in a holy place would necessarily bring more worshippers to the shrine. But can the selection of these shrines have been completely arbitrary? Should we not expect to find some common features, some (perhaps unconscious) rationale in the demarcation of certain shrines as particularly good in effecting cures? The clearest 'official' statement in Athens actually relates to a rather different aspect of health. A Delphic reply, quoted in Demosthenes, contains the following advice: itepi fryieíaç ťhkiv te Kai eijxeaöai Ali ijjiaxm, 'HpaicÀfì, AnóXXam /ipooxaxripicp.24 At first sight these seem rather surprising deities to choose. There is no mention of the most popular among the healing gods and heroes, Asklepios, nor of any of the local healing heroes. But we do find Zeus Hypatos, in the equivalent form Hypsistos, as a healing god on the Pnyx in the second and third centuries after Christ, and the shrine itself is older.25 Herakles too is quite popular as a healer, in Attica and elsewhere; the shrine of Herakles Alexikakos at Melite apparently received a new cult statue during the plague.2'1 Herakles, Zeus and Apollo Paion appear together as a sacrifice group in the Amphiareion of Oropos, so clearly in a roughly similar context;27 but the real clue to the reference here is the third god, Apollo Prostaterios, who is chiefly known for the sacrifices regularly performed to him by the prytaneis in the third and second centuries.2* A civic god then, probably, as Wycherley suggests, the Apollo in the bouleuterion.29 21 Brelich 1 16: Solders 57. 22 One possible example not listed in Solders concerns Demeter, recipient of a fourth-century dedication of eyes at Eleusis; see O. Rubensohn, AM 20 (1895) 360-7, and Richardson, HHD 229 (on lines 228-30). But this interpretation is questioned by F. T. van Straten. 'Gifts for the Gods', in H. S. Versnel, ed..

Hipp. 144) it is not clear that she has ordinarily such associations. 24 'On health matters, sacrifice and pray to Highest Zeus, Herakles, Protecting Apollo': Dem. 21.52, delivered in 348. The oracle is dated not long before by Parke and Wormell (I 337-8), but there is no real indication of date. See also J.

His function, then, is to ensure the welfare of all citizens, and the same is probably true of Herakles Alexikakos, if his shrine is really so closely linked with the plague. And the ailments of individual lower-class women represent (from the Greek point of view) a decline from the original interests of Zeus Hypatos/Hypsistos, to judge by his name and the site of his sanctuary.-" All this is far from surprising, given the public, official nature of this oracle. Apollo is counselling preventative methods for all, not curative methods for the sick. Health viewed as a matter of public concern does not have much to do with the hero and the individual. The operative agents are the great gods of the city, the same who would protect the state from other perils such as foreign attack (to which plague is so often the equivalent in myth). Other than Herakles, whose status is ambiguous, heroes are not attested in this connexion, at least in Athens, but we might expect that the major heroes of the community, the archegetai of city or smaller unit, would be fully operational in this sphere. But the healing- heroes proper are altogether different. Although it is not impossible that the concept of the all- protective deity could give rise to his performing individual cures - the two things can never be completely divorced - when we consider the shrines where cures are effected, we find a situation quite different from that pertaining to the city's health. The choice of a shrine is presumably dictated by personal piety, physical proximity, personal divine advice in dreams or human advice in conversation, and not by an official, civic oracle. And whereas Zeus Hypatos, Herakles and Apollo Prostaterios would be worshipped with ordinary group sacrifices and prayers, in the case of the healing heroes a particularly personal commitment is necessary, mirroring the worshipper's sense of personal favour which has so often made the reception of divine healing an especially potent religious experience. A personal sacrifice - at Oropos the offerer may even take the part of the priest when the latter is absent12 - may be followed by incubation in the sanctuary, although within Attica this is attested only for the Amphiareion and the city Asklepieion. (Neither of these centres housed a cult of native origin, but both must be considered here; Asklepios was brought to the centre of the city and perhaps associated with older healing heroes, while Amphiaraos, though of Boeotian origin, evidently became important to both state and individual while Oropos remained under Athenian control.11) In such cults, healing is brought about by direct contact with the god or hero in dreams, a form suited chiefly to individual concerns but capable of other applications. At the Amphiareion, the worshipper/patient lies in the skin of his sacrificial animal, identifying himself closely with the victim and with the sacrificial act, and he lies on the ground, like the x«H«ie^voi prophetic 30 SEG XV 1 1 2.9- 1 0; BCH 80 ( 1 956) 64-9. 51 'VvļnaTOĢ is in general the commoner title later, coming to be associated with the Jewish god (Nock. HThR 29 (1936) 39-88 = Essays I 414-43). It is thus possible that the cult may be an eastern importation. The Pnyx sanctuary as we know it is at any rate quite different from that of the Parian Zeus Hypatos: [o]poç 'Yjiocto- àteXeoTOi où ôen[í]ç 0"ù5è yuvai[K]í (IG XII(5) 183, fifth century). 12 IG VII 235 = LSS 69 = V.

Interest on an individual level is suggested not only by the epigraphic evidence but by the several comedies entitled Amphiaraos (below, p. 18 and n. 53.) Cf. also S. El. 836-40.

It appears that in about 330 a delegation of three men was sent to consult the god on a question of tribal boundaries, albeit in Oropos itself and in circumstances involving the god's own interests.15 Furthermore, we should compare with Amphiaraos the obviously related Boeotian figure of Trophonios, like the healing hero swallowed up by the earth in myth, whose oracle at Lebadeia functioned not by means of dreams but by an actual descent into the earth. Trophonios is not normally thought of as a healing god, but health is as likely as any topic to have figured prominently in his business; Euripides' Xouthos consults him about his childlessness, and 'crops or children' are envisaged as possible subjects for this consultation. Such practical concerns seem more plausible, at least for the early period, than the somewhat fanciful account in Plutarch's De genio Soc rati s.™ Moreover, Pausanias, describing statues which must represent Trophonios and his female companion Herkyna, compares them with depictions of Asklepios and Hygieia.17 The goose held by Herkyna also has connexions with healing.1* It seems likely that both Trophonios and Amphiaraos began their careers as underworld figures with mantic powers, and later - in greater or less degree - became associated with healing.1' The opposite development, from healers to general oracles, is less likely because there is a clear connexion between the earth - starting-point of the development - and oracles. Further, the living Amphiaraos was a prophet, not a healer. With Trophonios also were associated snakes, as with Amphiaraos at both Oropos and the Rhamnousian shrine, and also Asklepios.40 Snakes have an intimate connexion with heroes and 'chthonic' deities because of their mysterious appearances and disappearances from the earth; under the earth, it seems, they still retain their power and vitality.41 In this context they are suitable vehicles of the healing power which, as it comes through dreams and oracles, is situated below the ground. And in this way comes about the particular connexion of the hero with healing, as Milchhöfer saw;42 the hero, buried in the ground, naturally acquires the powers associated with the earth. Sometimes the hero is not content to remain on orthodox lines in the earth, but like the snake disappears and reappears. Amphiaraos was swallowed by the earth 14 Paus. 1.34.5. The Selloi: II. 16.234. Dreams from the earth: E. Hec. 70, IT 1262-7; perhaps Od. 24.12. II. 1.63 (Kai Tap t' övap £k Aióç éoxiv) might be taken as expressing an opposite view, but in the context probably means little more than 'of divine origin'. The dream sent by Zeus to Agamemnon in Iliad 2 is more indicative. However, this type of interaction between gods and men is of the essence of the Iliad, and need not represent a universally applicable picture. ■15 Hyperides 3.14. 16 E. Ion 304, Plut.

This too is the purpose of the ritual addressed to the dead Agamemnon, suggesting a contact with actual practice.45 And heroes may emerge spontaneously from the ground in order to give help at moments of crisis, as Theseus was depicted on the Stoa Poikile fresco of the battle of Marathon.4* The healing heroes similarly give help from the earth when it is needed, while the patient/worshipper comes close to meet him by lying on the ground. This, at any rate, is a pattern which applies to Amphiaraos, about whose cult we have the most detailed information, and there are clearly points of contact with Asklepios, who is really, like Amphiaraos, a figure on the borderline between hero and god. The mysterious figure Pankrates on the banks of the Ilissos may also be related.47 In the cases of the other Attic healing heroes - Amynos, Aristomachos, Mousaios and the various 'hero physicians', fipcoeę íatpoí - other strands may be dominant. So much, for the present, for the factors common to some or all of the healing heroes. We muai now consider when, why and by whom each shrine is used - although the paucity of our information may preclude arrival at any really conclusive point. The evidence available seems to show a remarkable regional distribution of shrines of healing heroes, concentrated on the more famous or larger areas, yet this is probably due to the bias of both literary and archaeological sources. Five sanctuaries in Athens itself (including the two Asklepios sanctuaries, which have clear heroic elements), two, possibly three in the Piraeus area,48 are 41 Paus. 1.34.4,2. 44 Plin. NH 103.225. 45 A. Cho. 306-478. 46 Paus. 1.15.3. Strictly, in the Cimonian version, Theseus should have been still on Skyros at this date - but this did not, of course, prevent him from receiving cult in Athens. In any case, the hero issues from 'the ground' vaguely, not from any particular burial place. The association of heroes, perhaps here rather close to 'ghosts' such as the dead Agamemnon, with anodoi is attested in the sixth-century Samian poet Asios' description of an unwanted guest: év 8è |iéooioiv / fjpúx; elotiļKEt ßopßopou éÇavaSúç (fr. 14 West). Cf. Crates, Hpcœç fr. 12 Austin. 47 Only a small proportion of the material excavated has been published: Miliadis, ÍTAE 1953, 47-60; 1954, 41-9. The colossal heads depicted on two of the published reliefs (1954, figs. 6,7) are rare if not unique on the votive relief (though relatively common on vases) and so presumably have some significance peculiar to Pankrates. However, it would be over-confident to suppose that this type of depiction represents an anodos-, see C. Bérard. Anodoi (Rome 1974) 43-5, 55-60. 4* The Athenian shrines are (a) the Asklepieion on the south slope of the Acropolis, (b) the sanctuary of Amynos west of this, also associated with Asklepios, (c) the shrine of the fjpcoę iatpóç, (d) the shrine on the banks of the Ilissos, associated with Pankrates, Herakles and Palaimon, (e) the sanctuary to which belonged the third-century altar to Amphiaraos IG II2 4441. In addition Pausanias (1.34.3) mentions an altar to Amphilochos somewhere in the city; there is no indication of date or original location, and he may well be referring to the shrine of the f^pcoç iatpóç identified with Amphilochos in Kutsch no. 4 (1st c. BC). In the Piraeus/Phaleron area, as well as the Asklepieion at Zea, we have the third-century inscription IG II2 1282, which seems to refer to a local sacrifice to Amphiaraos. (IG II2 1344.10, from Acharnai, also refers to Amphiaraos. but the context is quite uncertain: this is from a much later period, being dated AD 28/9.) Although Pausanias states that Mousaios was buried at the Mouseion (1.25.8), another tradition knows of a grave in Phaleron. with an epitaph (Diog. Laert. 1.3). It would be over-sanguine to suppose that this necessarily indicates a cult: Aristophanes' statement (Ran. 1033) that Mousaios taught men éÇaKEOeiç te vóocov Kai XPHOUOÚÇ presumably reflects books circulating under the name of Mousaios, and the view of some of the scholia (the Holkham MS and the Aldine, both deriving from the Triclinian tradition) that at Peiraeus Mousaios depaneíaç vooiļiiotttov KataSeîÇat XfyExai need be nothing more than a guess from the text, combined with the tradition reported in Diogenes Laertius. Cf. Solders 87. I have not taken</page><page sequence="25">1 8 THE HEROES OF ATTICA figures which need no comment, but added to these the only other healing shrines of which we know are the Amphiareia of Oropos and Rhamnous, and the sanctuary of the fípcoç iaxpóç at Eleusis.49 However, it would be rash to conclude from this that smaller and less important areas did not know the specialist healing hero. There is no reason why healing cults should be reflected among the minor cults of the sacrifice calendars of Thorikos or Erchia, for such heroes might well have passed under non-indicative names; alternatively, healing heroes might not have been the concern of the official organisation of the deme. Pouilloux has shown how a healing-shrine whose history as some sort of sacred place goes back to archaic times was taken up, enlarged, and partially changed in character by the later presence of the garrison at Rhamnous.50 Yet the shrine was clearly concerned with healing already before the garrison's importation of Amphiaraos as the presiding deity.51 There may have been many other minor healing cults dotted about the Attic countryside which were not picked up by the tide of events; even if we knew that the distribution of population worked in this manner, we could not assurer that only the centres of large population produced specialist healing heroes, while country people were content with 'all-purpose' sanctuaries. The chronological data are even less definite. Restored health must always be one of the most popular requests made of a superhuman being, but when should we date the emergence of the specialist healing hero? The relevant shrines yield nothing datable before the sixth century, permitting no very useful conclusions. It does seem quite likely that there is a renewed, widespread interest in healing cults towards the end of the fifth century, the Peloponnesian war years, in fact. At this time there were major developments in the two cults which subsequently became Attica's most important. In 420 Asklepios arrived in Athens and took up his abode on the south slopes of the Acropolis, perhaps already the home of some minor healing complex. At Zea he arrived only shortly before.52 And although the cult of Amphiaraos undoubtedly contains old elements, the sanctuary at Oropos has produced nothing which can be dated before c. 414 - the date of Aristophanes' comedy Àn&lt;piápaoç, which one suspects of having had a topical relevance.53 In 422 Philokleon had been taken for an incubation cure to Aigina, not to Oropos.54 One factor often adduced for this increased interest in such cults is of course the plague of 428 - however insistently Thucydides tells us that oracles were no help (2.53.3) - and as we have seen there is explicit testimony for such a connexion in the case of the sanctuary of Herakles Alexikakos at Melite. Nonetheless, there is a long interval between this account oť the Çévoç iaxpóç, Luciarfs Toxaris, which would make another city shrine, because in the absence of other evidence for such a cult we are not justified in assuming that Lucian's account is based on fact. However, it is of the essence of circumstantial detail in this type of fiction that it be completely plausible. 4t&gt; Bekk. Anecd. 262 mentions a Í1p(DÇ iaxpóç called Aristomachos, buried by the Dionysion at Marathon; attempts have therefore been made to emend the Tetrapolis calendar (IG II2 1358, BI9) to produce an Aristomachos (e.g. in LSS no. 20). But Aristomachos does turn up as the name of one of the heroes in the healing-shrine at Rhamnous: Pouilloux, Forteresse p. 145 no. 33 (= IG II2 4452), and cf. no. 32 (IG II2 4436). It seems almost certain that we are dealing with a simple confusion between the two most famous demes of northern Attica. However, the Dionysion is a problem in either location. Cf. also schol. Dem. 19.249 (no indication of place). 50 Pouilloux, Forteresse 93-102. 51 Pouilloux, Forteresse 143 no. 30. 52 The well-known contemporary record is IG II2 4960. 53 Nothing earlier than 414: Petrakos (n. 32) 66. Other plays named Amphiaraos cannot be dated; the fragments of Aristophanes do not permit a reconstruction of the plot, though healing is evidently a theme. The fact that the priest's office was annual, attested by numerous Oropian inscriptions which use it as an indication of date, further suggests a fifth-century revision of the cult. 54 Ar. Vesp. 122-3. Of course a short sea voyage may simply have been more convenient than a long journey over land.

Again, the evidence is not great enough in bulk nor distinct enough in application to say very much about what type of person used the healing-shrines. We can get some way by dividing the dedicators of votive offerings by sex. The evidence is largely fourth century, although some is hellenistic; in any case with one exception they present a similar sort of picture, in which women make up a fair proportion of the dedicators. The existence of any discrepancy at all in most of the shrines is probably due, as so often with private epigraphical evidence, to the greater disposability of money in the hands of men. In most respects, too, there is no marked difference in the pattern of shrines frequented by either sex. For it is noteworthy that there are no healing heroines (in contrast to heroines who preside over childbirth) to whom women could turn.55 This may be seen as corresponding to ordinary life, where at least until the end of the fourth century women's 'official' role in medicine seems to have been largely connected with midwifery and related matters.56 Even if, as seems likely a priori , there were women who claimed general healing skills, it is probable that the male physicians were seen even by patients as the dominant, authoritative figures, and it is to them that the healing heroes correspond. Women were helped by male heroes as they were by male doctors; although the healing hero may often be a chthonic, daimon-like figure, he also often conforms to the model of his human counterpart. Yet he might also have an advantage over the human physician, for we see from the Hippocratic corpus that though male doctors were used to treating women's complaints, women themselves might, not surprisingly, have been embarrassed to speak of their ailments, especially the more intimate ones, to a doctor; in such cases superhuman help might well seem a more attractive idea, obviously a factor instrumental in sending women rather than men to the healing heroes.57 The one shrine where women are poorly represented is not strictly - so far as Athenian terminology is concerned - that of a hero at all. The shrine is the Asklepieion on the south 55 laso, who appears in Aristophanes fr. 21 Austin (but here probably as Amphiaraos' daughter) and along with Panakeia, in Plutus 701-2, as well as Aigle (or Aglaia?) and Hygieia (fourth-century paian, PMG 934) and Epione (note 64), Asklepios' daughters and wife, seem to have no significance outside his immediate entourage, and as their names suggest are almost abstractions. 56 On women healers, see H. King, PC PS ns 21 (1986) 71 n. 25; the whole article is relevant to the general question of women in medicine. The factors governing a woman's reactions on falling ill, and the relative probability of her treatment by a male or female healer, are of course far from clear. E. Hipp. 293-6 seems plausible: ei |Lièv vooeîç ti xíov a7coppTļicov kockcòv yovaÎKeç aiôe aDyicadiatávai vóaov ei ô' è'K&lt;popoç aot a')|i(popá rcpòç àpaévaç }jé y', (òç iaxpoíç 7cp07ļLia ļarļv')ūfļ xóôe (If your sickness is one of the private ills, there are women here [the chorus] to treat your illness; but if you can speak of your trouble to men, then tell it, so that doctors may be informed of the matter.) But if this is not simply a touch of imagined archaism, or a suitable extension of the oppressively female atmosphere of the first half of the play, it would seem that in the fifth century such women operated with different methods from the male physicians, and were largely ignored by them: although the Epidemics are full of case histories of women's ajioppTļTa Kam (observed and treated by men) I think there is only one episode which shows a woman healing another woman (5.25, Littré V. 224). In Littré VIII. 60 ( = Gyn. 1.21) the 'other woman' is presumably instructed by the doctor to carry out the internal examination. Elsewhere in the Hippocratic corpus we meet, unsurprisingly, women attendants at a birth; the description àKEGTOpíÔeç (Littré VIII. 614) suggests some skill and a slightly broader scope than just 'attendant'. But the distinction in Euripides' terminology may be thought significant: men, and apparently only men, can be iatpoi, while women (without special training) are able, rather vaguely, to 'put diseases in order'. It is not until the latter part of the fourth century that we find the word icxTpóç applied to a woman, Phanostrate, IG II2 6873. (On this grave relief, see E. Berger, Das Basier Arztrelief (Basel 1970) 160-2. The different readings of the text which are listed in SEG 23 (1983) 214 do not affect Phanostrate's profession.) 57 Hippocratic Corpus, ed. Littré, vol. VIII, 126.12 ff. ( = Gyn. 1.62.)</page><page sequence="27">20 THE HEROES OF ATTICA slope of the Acropolis. Of the fourth-century inscribed dedications collected in IG II2 (in the area between 435 1 and 4434), fifty-one were made by men (forty-six excluding the priests) and only five by women (in addition two are made by a man and woman together and thirteen are deficient in the dedicator's name). These are very much larger numbers than anything we are dealing with elsewhere, but the fourth-century material from the nearby shrine of Amynos, where Asklepios was also worshipped, gives three dedications by men and three by women, and the Pankrateion (of the published material) two of each. The inventories of the Amphiareion and of the Athenian fíptoç iaxpóç contain relatively more material, but belong to a later date; here too the ratio of the sexes is roughly equal.™ There is a good probability, then, that the Asklepieion figures are significant, particularly as the proportion of women increases slightly over the course of the century, although it always remains very small. This is particularly curious in view of the fact that Asklepios is also at this time invading the nearby Amyneion, which women have no hesitation in using. Nor is Asklepios elsewhere preponderantly a man's god. We could, perhaps, attribute these figures to a supposed greater conservatism of women, displayed in their reluctance to use an unfamiliar shrine. But there may be another explanation. The sacred spring of the Asklepieion cannot have been devoid of cult before the arrival of the new god (as it still is not, after his departure). Pausanias tells us that by this spring Poseidon's son Halirrhothios raped Alkippe, the daughter of Ares (an event associated in the myth with hostility, not birth and fruitfulness) and E. Schmidt ingeniously identified Halirrhothios with Halon, whose priesthood Sophocles held; the cult of an old healing hero, named from the spring's rather salty waters, was then supplanted by that of the god.5'' Is it possible that Halon was a hero who helped only the male sex, into whose sanctuary women were discouraged from entering - the myth, which was well known, expressing this hostility in its own terms?6" The arrival of Asklepios would necessitate new regulations, but old habits might still explain women's reluctance to use the shrine. We can then isolate one or two of the factors determining people's choice of a healing shrine. But most important of all, perhaps, were imponderable personal factors causing different people to favour different shrines. Kallistion, who, presumably in the third century, made a very large number of dedications in the sanctuary of the fíptoç iaxpóç, represents a familiar type of devotee, even if her case is not characteristic of most worshippers.61 Can anything more be said about healing heroes in general? I have already suggested a partial explanation for the connexion, lying in the chthonic nature of the healing divinity. This is an idea which blurs the distinction between god and hero, and indeed some of the figures we have been considering are of ambiguous status. Both Asklepios and Amphiaraos were generally regarded as real persons who had actually lived, although Attic sources call them both deóç. This confusion of concepts nicely illustrates the two main strands which go to make up the healing hero. Like the god, the hero may effect cures in a manner which bears no resemblance to human care for the sick, perhaps a manner which defies analysis or which may be represented in mysterious, daimonic 5,1 The Amphiareion inventory (IG VII 303), made in the years 202-199, lists 45 dedications by men and 32 by women; that of the Athenian fļpco^ iaxpóç (IG li- 839) actually has more dedications by women, seventeen to thirteen - but this is largely due to the ten dedications made by one individual, Kallistion. Outside Athens, the miracle cures of the Asklepieion at Epidauros record both men and women patients (IG IV 951-6), and the Coan evidence suggests the same: S. M. Sherwin-White, Ancient Cos (Göttingen 1978) 276. w Paus. 1 .2 1 .4; E. Schmidt, AM 38 ( 1 9 1 3) 73-7. 60 The myth is attested in E.

Both forms of action are depicted in parallel on an early fourth-century votive relief from Oropos. A physician in human form attends to the dedicator's shoulder; a snake does the same while the dedicator sleeps, and the worshipper then adores the god and sets up a votive.62 The hero - including Asklepios, with his human past - was uniquely equipped to offer this double form of action. In the Epidaurian temple records the god comes to patients in their dreams in the guise of a human physician and this dreaming may correspond to actual healing by a snake.61 The action of a superhuman being is conceived in terms of the familiar human action, the hero is modelled on the doctor; hence we have not the 'healing hero' but more specifically the physician hero, fíptoç iatpóç. Not only was the hero, as a former mortal, closer than the god to his worshipper in terms of experience, but in this case he had been, like Asklepios, a physician while still alive. Viewed from this angle the function Of the healing hero is not identical with that of the god. He represents the technical skills and closeness to the patient of the ordinary human physician, coupled with superhuman effectiveness. A god's way of ending sickness is often based on a method different from those of humans, appearing magical rather than rational; it may even seem somewhat impersonal; but the hero physician is modelled on the human healer and so can bring a direct, personal cure to the sufferer. Like the god who responds to personal prayer, the human physician is tíjcioç, gentle and comforting.64 His heroic counterpart, then, is doubly so, and this makes a direct and personal relationship with such figures relatively easy to envisage. The personal relationship with these heroes could even extend over wider fields: the dedication of an àajcíôiov and an àKpoaxóXiov in the shrine of the fíptoç iatpóç in the third century seems to indicate his intervention in cases of war and shipwreck.65 But this is an extension of the original function of such figures, which is well- defined and often expressed clearly in the mythical terms of the hero's life as a mortal. 2. Marriage, childbirth, care of children Personal health is a matter of concern to every individual, at least potentially, but in most societies half of the population has had cause for extra concern about its physical well-being. Childbirth in the human species is an event fraught with pain and danger, in Greek society corresponding to, but outweighing - in the view of Euripides' Medea - the hazards of the battlefield for men.66 It is dangerous both from the ordinary physical point of view and because it places women in a liminal position and hence temporarily apart from ordinary society. Yet it is not an event to be avoided, since for the Greek woman childlessness is an even worse state, perhaps, than for the Greek man, and in order for her to attain her 'normal' place in society it is necessary for her to be thus periodically segregated from it. Marriage, childbirth and childcare, then, form a complex of events which mark out the special role of women and define them as producers of children, as well as differentiating them from men. This complex can be viewed both on the individual level - the events which define an individual as a woman and which shape her life and perhaps death - and as an aspect of the city's life (the women of Attica 62 PI.

It would be surprising then if events so critical from both these angles could not be eased by heroic helpers, and in fact heroic cults show the importance of both perspectives. Inevitably, however, there was some overlap with the more 'generalised' healing heroes and gods who might supply remedies for infertility, treat gynaecological complaints, and so on. But in addition there is a whole range of rather different figures whose province might roughly oe described as human fertility, more especially as viewed from the female angle: these are beings approached by women for themselves as child-bearers, potential or actual, and for their children. I avoid the use of the word 'heroes', for we find from the outset a very obvious contrast with the healing heroes. Some healing powers, it is true, stand on the border-line between god and hero (the distinction, it appears, not being relevant to these cases), but there is also a strong element of rationalisation and anthropomorphism apparent in the various 'hero physicians'. These figures are very often similarly employed in their heroic saga, so that their activity as heroes may be viewed simply as an extension, perhaps at a more powerful level, of their earthly occupation. However, the epic knows little of nurses and midwives, and so here there is much less opportunity for the co- operation of myth and function.67 The superhuman figures concerned with childbirth and childcare appear to act in ways which are not analogous to human behaviour. Connected with this observation is the fact that very few of the figures connected with this sphere can unequivocally be called heroines, in the sense of a person once human and alive. Goddesses are far more frequently invoked, and there are a great number of these; Aphrodite, the Genetyllides or Koliades, Hera, Eileithyia, Artemis (particularly as Kalliste or Lochia) and the personage known simply as Kourotrophos.6* Further deities apparently connected with childbirth appear on the altar found at Peiraeus dedicated by Xenokrateia (IG II2 4547). Here we notice, as elsewhere, nymphs in addition to goddesses. In fact the role of nymphs in childbirth and childcare is stated more or less explicitly by Euripides ( Electra 625-6): - Nú|j&lt;paiç ¿Jiópow' êpoTiv, (bç ëÔoÇé noi. - tpotpeîa itaíSíov fļ rcpò néÂÀovxoç tókou; 'He was preparing an offering to the nymphs, I thought.' - 'As thanks for children's nurture, or before a birth?' Such nymphs may come very close to a certain type of heroine. Heroines are frequently less dependent on a former life as mortals than are heroes. Thus, to quote Nock's most striking example, Strepsiades can suppose that the cloud-chorus is composed of heroines (Ar. Nub. 315), so clearly not referring to beings who were once mortal women.6'' Of course not all heroines are of this type; some are very strictly parallel to heroes, even in their civic functions,7" while others are fundamentally mythological; the Catalogue of Women and the Odyssean 67 It is not inconceivable that the Homeric Eurykleia might have had a cult on Ithaca, but in fact there is no evidence for such a phenomenon. There was a statue of Eurykleia in the temple of Artemis at Ephesos (Strabo 641 ), but it does not seem to have been a cult statue: there were many miscellaneous works of art there. 6SOn this figure, see Th. Hadzisteliou-Price, Kourotrophos (Leiden 1978) 101-17, who believes that in Attica Kourotrophos was always an epithet of Ge. But both appear in the sacrifice group in the Tetrapolis calendar at B 13-15. w Nock, Heroes 165 = Essays 596. n. 80. Cf. also A. Green. Nymphs in archaic and classical Greece (diss.

From a later period we have the rļpcoiooai KTioxai, named along with f)pweç. at Demetrias (IG IX(2) 1 129). Sacral heroines are another type whose human nature is important, and they exist alongside sacral heroes, as priestesses alongside priests; some of the figures I am now considering fulfil that function, among others.</page><page sequence="30">THE HERO AND THE INDIVIDUAL 23 Nekyia provide evidence of the interest taken at an early date in the mortal mistresses of gods and mothers of heroes. But others, especially perhaps those heroines who appear in groups without individual names, are really indistinguishable from nymphs. Hence it is a priori quite likely that such groups of heroines should concern themselves with childbirth. In this connexion we should recall the nameless groups of heroines in the Attic countryside, for instance the rļpcoivai who receive sacrifice èrci Ix°ívcP and those én nuX&amp;vi in the Erchia calendar." We cannot of course prove that these are heroines of the nymph type, rather than ex-mortals (if such a firm distinction will hold), originating perhaps in a real group of female burials; it is also possible that heroines of the latter sort might come to be assimilated with the other type and take on 'kourotrophic' functions. Another group of heroines who very probably had some function of this kind is the Hyakinthides, who in myth were the nurses of the child Dionysos; the names given to two of them in one tradition, Protogeneia and Pandora, strongly suggest an interest in birth and fertility. The picture is, however, very much complicated by the myth of their sacrificial death, which places them among the city-saviours; they will be discussed more fully in the following chapter. The two Attic examples of kourotrophic heroines on which we are best informed are those of the daughters of Kekrops and of Iphigeneia, both puzzling cults on which much ink has been spilt. The area of discussion reminds us that in contrast with the healing heroes, the aspects of the cult of these heroines we know most about are the public, social ones, the city's festivals. The relationship between hero and individual may continue in its simple form, but it has also been transformed into something larger and more institutionalised, as all the city's young, all the city's mothers are protected, or as the original significance of the rite perhaps comes to be forgotten. A further complication is of course that childbirth obviously concerns two individuals, the mother and the child. The care of the infant is simpler; there the mother will normally make requests on behalf of her offspring, but most cults of this type have at least potentially a double aspect, the protection of the mother and the protection of the child. (An exception is that of Herakles as patron of the young; he concerns himself only with children, not with mothers, and not with the event of birth itself.) This double aspect can lead to some confusion when we investigate the more arcane rituals connected with this type of cult, since girls could be required to act either in their capacity as children or else in some sort of initiatory sense as future mothers. Such rituals - the Arrephoria and the arkteia at Brauron, primarily - also prompt the question how far this type of rite was consciously connected with childbirth and the care of children. Were the thought patterns which historians of religion and anthropologists try to reconstruct actually the conscious thoughts of the average Athenian? Often enough, surely not. The performance of the ritual may be an end in itself, because it has been decreed, or because it is according to ancestral custom. Where this is so, the role of the heroine is more as first performer of the rite, providing its justification in myth, than as superhuman power able, goddess-like, to confer benefits. Rituals performed at regular times 71 19 Metageitnion and 14 Pyanopsion; cf. R. Parker, 'Festivals of the Attic Demes', in Gifts to the Gods (Boreas 15: Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis), 145-6. Another personage from the Erchia calendar who might be considered here is Alochos (27 Boedromion). In a sacrifice context including the nymphs. Acheloös. Hermes and Ge (somewhat reminiscent of Xenokrateia's altar, IG II2 4547). she is certainly (contra Parke. Festivals 180) to be interpreted as 'the wife' and not 'the unwedded one': this is a group concerned with fertility and birth. However, we are faced with a problem of definition: is Alochos felt to be a heroine, or a minor goddess? Or is the name an epithet of some more major power?</page><page sequence="31">24 THE HEROES OF ATTICA according to the calendar thus may contrast with sporadic appeals to divine or heroic help in times of need. Aglauros, Pandrosos and the more shadowy Herse, in myth the daughters of Kekrops, are located on the Athenian acropolis itself. As with the Hyakinthides there are elements of self- sacrifice which complicate the picture, and none of the sisters has quite a straightforward cult. As a group, however, there are several factors which link these heroines with the care of children. It is easier perhaps to trace this kourotrophic function than an interest in birth, since the latter really depends solely on one interpretation of the puzzling ritual of the Arrephoria. But the former is suggested both by the association of a cult of Aglauros and Pandrosos with Kourotrophos72 and by inference from the myth of the child Erichthonios, where the daughters of Kekrops act as his nurses. The more spectacular elements of this story do not conceal the original primary function of these heroines. Whether this was a function actively continued in historical times is not clear; there is no direct evidence for any of the sisters as protectors of young children. Neither the site generally supposed to be the Pandroseion nor that which we now know to be the shrine of Aglauros has yielded finds like those from Brauron which suggest a cult concerned with children.7' There is more direct evidence for a historical connexion with adolescents thain with young children. The ephebes took their oath in Aglauros' sanctuary;74 possibly also relevant is their sacrifice to Athena Polias, Kourotrophos and Pandrosos.75 In a variant of the usual version, Aglauros leapt from the Acropolis not in terror at the sight of the snake coiled round the infant Erichthonios, but as a deliberate sacrificial death in order to secure victory for Athens.76 This would be the ideal for the ephebes, too. These connexions were seen by Merkelbach (n. 74), but it is possible to go further and place these sisters too among those heroines who save their country by protecting its children and young men. This aspect stresses the public, civic aspect of the city's youth, rather than concern with the individual's problems, and it will be more fully discussed in the following chapter. Adolescents then seem to be the specific concern of Aglauros, not of all the sisters together; a connexion with younger children can be traced rather more indirectly with Pandrosos. The ritual of the Arrephoria, though in some degree related to all the sisters, seems to be particularly associated with Pandrosos; this is suggested by two dedications of statues of arrephoroi not merely to Athena, as is the usual formula, but to Athena and Pandrosos.77 The dedications belong to the second century, but there is no reason to assume that they represent a fundamental conceptual change in the rite from earlier times. On the other hand, the existence of several (two or four) arrephoroi would suggest a mythical connexion with the group of sisters, and the fact that the daughters of Kekrops were the first to weave woollen clothes can hardly be unrelated to the weaving of Athena's peplos by the arrephoroi at or near the site of their predecessors' royal palace.7" Most obviously, the ritual of the Arrephoria itself, in which the girls carried objects whose identity was unknown to them, can plausibly be compared with the myth of Erichthonios, the child entrusted to the daughters of Kekrops on condition that they did not look inside his basket. It is then a ritual which is concerned with childcare; perhaps, if as 72 Salaminioi decree 45-6. perhaps referring to a deme cult: see Appendix 1 s.w.

Whatever the grammar of the ritual, it is quite possible, so far as the evidence goes, that none of the sisters was consciously regarded as concerned with childbirth at all. Whereas the cult of Brauron, with which it exhibits some similarities, clearly spread, that on the Acropolis may have contracted, for no more than two or possibly four girls were involved in any one year. It may indeed have been an honour for these girls and their families to serve thus, but it puts limits on the festival's contemporary significance. Moreover, at least in the time of Pausanias, none of the participants - including the priestess - knew the identity of the objects involved in the rite.80 This does not remove the religious significance for the participants - indeed such secrecy may increase their sense of religious awe - but it does of course mean that they cannot know the 'original' nature of the rite, if that is defined in a close relation to specific objects and acts. Closer, perhaps, to Athenian consciousness, was the role of Pandrosos and her sisters as sacral heroines of a typical kind, giving (as often) a mythical form to the institution of the rite. They stand in a very close relation to Athena; both Aglauros and Pandrosos are attested as epithets of the goddess, and Aglauros was her first priestess.81 This would suggest that as well as being semi-divine figures in their own right, they also supplied heroic prototypes for the priestess of Athena Polias, the different sisters perhaps relating to different festivals. As far as the Arrephoria goes, it is clear that it is the little girls, the áppi1&lt;pópoi, who correspond to the sisters in the myth, while the role of the priestess, who gives them the sacred objects to carry in their secret procession, is that of Athena herself. However, a different picture emerges from the involvement of the sisters in other festivals. We have lexicographical testimony, which there is no very good reason to doubt, that Aglauros was connected in some way with the related festivals of the Plynteria and the Kallynteria, and the inscription from the Aglaurion mentions a procession connected with her; further, Philochorus records a deipnophoria to all three sisters.82 Little is known of the last two events, but we know enough of the Kallynteria and Plynteria to make it unlikely that the arrephoroi were involved. The little girls were not the invariable representatives of the daughters of Kekrops. These festivals were the special province, not of the priestess of Athena Polias and her assistants, but of sacred officials from the genos of the Praxiergidai. It would seem quite likely that in this scheme it was a Praxiergid priestess who was the correlative in real life of the mythical Aglauros, first priestess of Athena. The heroine's significance in this rite would lie not so much in her role as childbirth heroine as in her closeness to the goddess and her status as first performer of the rite, echoing the actual performance on a mythical plane. It is Aglauros alone who seems to be connected with the Plynteria (as with the ephebes), not the group of three sisters, and Pandrosos too received cult apart from the other two: Philochorus, perhaps referring to a particular festival rather than reporting a general rule, records that the sacrifice of a cow to Athena requires a sheep to be given to Pandrosos, known 79 W. Burkert, 'Kekropidensage und Arrhephoria', Hermes 94 (1966),' 1-25. Details of this interpretation are challenged (not entirely convincingly) by N.

No shrine is known for Herse, although several suggestions have been made; possibly she enjoyed no independent cult. 1,4 The obvious conclusion is that Aglauros and Pandrosos were originally two separate nymph/heroines occupying different parts of the Acropolis, each of whom became attracted into perhaps different areas of the cult of Athena Polias. As nymphs, they would already have taken an interest in childbirth, which was then brought into connexion with Athena's own function as aiding fertility."5 Later still would be their connexion with each other, their integration into mythical history as the daughters of Kekrops, and the creation of the less clearly defined sister Herse, whose name may be merely a dewy echo of Pandrosos. Indeed, the iconographical evidence suggests an early tradition of two sisters only.*6 The group of three sisters conforms to a pattern common in Attica and Boeotia, but influential though the pattern is, in this case it never quite succeeds in expunging traces of the sisters' original separateness. Whether separate or together, it is quite possible that the original function of the sisters in childbirth and childcare was never entirely lost sight of, mysterious though the ritual of the Arrephoria may have become. Aglauros was after all patroness of the ephebes. But other associations may have been important as well. It is interesting that Aglauros, and perhaps also Pandrosos, was worshipped in Attica outside Athens." At Erchia there is a sacrifice on 3 Skirophorion to Kourotrophos, Athena Polias, Aglauros, Zeus Polieus, Poseidon and one more deity - Jameson suggests Pandrosos and supposes that this is an echo or deliberate imitation of the Arrephoria, which we know took place in Skirophorion.1"1 But Pandrosos is not a necessary supplement; the Thorikos calendar also has a sacrifice to Athena and Aglauros in Skirophorion which it refers to the Plynteria, although the state celebration of the Plynteria takes place towards the end of Thargelion. It is possible, as Parker suggests, that the Plynteria and perhaps other festivals of Thorikos may share a common Ionian origin with their analogues in Athens, rather than being simple imitations of the rites of the city, and this is particularly persuasive in the case of Thorikos, a town of old traditions.*9 Yet even here Athenian elements seem to creep in, precisely with Aglauros; probably the Athenian Plynteria exert an influence on those of Thorikos without entirely expunging their peculiarities. In Erchia the Athenian elements seem if anything more marked. What are we to make of the presence in the Erchia calendar of Zeus Polieus and Poseidon, who seem very unlikely to have had a place in either Arrephoria or Plynteria? Considering the Erchia prescription simply as a group of deities, the sacrifice group looks as though it is conceived as the major deities of the Athenian acropolis, and it may be that their significance is precisely that. The Diipolieia, as well as the Arrephoria, fall in ^ Philochorus F 10. where a variant reading has Pandora, otherwise unknown in Athenian cult (though the name is given as one of the Hyakinthides in Phot., Suda s.v. riapôevoi). Cf. Staphylus F Cr H 269 F I, Lycurgus fr. 35 Blass, Harp. s.v. ejußoiov. 114 For instance, somewhere above what was then taken to be the Aglaurion is suggested in Preller-Robert 1.201. 1,5 For Athena as goddess of fertility, see Roscher in Roscher 1.683-4. 1,6 Uta Krön ( LIMC 1.294; cf. 285) points to ABY 40.17, dated to the first quarter of the sixth century. This shows two women side by side, one of whom is called Pandrosos; the rest of the subject is not certain, perhaps Hermes and Kekrops. s7 It is also possible that the priestess of Aglauros and Pandrosos mentioned in the Salarr.inioi inscription served a cult outside Athens, perhaps at Porthmos where so many of the cults in this inscription were based; the city priesthoods seem more likely to have been separate. 1,8 M.

In both Erchia and Thorikos, then, we see independent local adaptations of different festivals, and the role of Aglauros in both her major festivals may have been adopted in the demes. Her significance here is primarily civic; the emphasis has shifted from the heroine who helps individual women and children in the process of giving birth and raising the children born, towards a figure who not only represents the acropolis of Athens, but whose mythic and cultic traditions point towards the subordination of the individual to the city. It is her role particularly as giver of victory and patroness of the ephebes which is significant in the synoecistic context. Iphigeneia is the one pan-Attic heroine indubitably linked consciously in historical times with childbirth. She also presents some of the most difficult problems. Some of these will be dealt with in the next chapter; others may be approached through a comparison with the daughters of Kekrops, with whom Iphigeneia exhibits some striking similarities. As they stand in a very close relation to Athena - appearing as her priestesses or sharing their names with her - so does she to Artemis. The rite of the apierna has been since Aristophanes (Lys. 645) mentioned with that of the àppr|&lt;pópia; it seems not unlikely that the heroines stand in a similar relation to the rite. Traditions of sacrificial death are also common to both. Yet the nature of the evidence is rather different in the two cases. No myth connects Iphigeneia with childbirth or the care of children; her myths are not essentially aetiological, sacral tales, but part of epic, panhellenic saga. It is perhaps natural that once Iphigeneia had become part of this epic world the other type of myth should largely disappear, but it is still noteworthy that apparently the only trace of what seems to be an earlier Iphigeneia, the Brauronian story of the girl injured by a bear sacred to Artemis,'" has reference only to the form of the ritual practised at Brauron and not overtly to childbirth at all. Neither is Iphigeneia mythically represented as nurse to any child, here contrasting obviously with the daughters of Kekrops. In fact - and this is again a contrast with the heroines previously considered - Iphigeneia as kourotrophos is much less well attested than Iphigeneia as presiding over the event of birth itself. It must be stressed that the published data from the excavations at Brauron are unfortunately still very incomplete, but in the light of the information at present available the only real evidence for such a function comes from the numerous terracotta statuettes of children of both sexes which have been found at the sanctuary. The crucial factor is the representation of boys, because the significance of girls, even little girls, in such a context is ambiguous - should they be viewed as children, or (as seems to be the case in the arrephoria) as potential mothers? Whatever the precise significance of these statuettes, which still await a definitive study,92 it is at least clear that we are not dealing with an exclusively feminine cult. The deities of Brauron, as perhaps most deities operating in the field, did not make a precise separation between the welfare of the mother and that of the child, and it seems on the most cautious interpretation that mothers could at least make dedications on behalf of their children, whether male or female.

It is very often claimed that the stoa at Brauron was used as living and sleeping quarters for children, whether or not arktoi, who thus spent some time at the sanctuary, but the evidence is not really sufficient to demonstrate this. It is not clear that there were beds in the rooms of the stoa,9' and the description of the amphipoleion as év q&gt; (--?-) ôiait&amp;vxai''4 leaves the subject uncertain; it may refer only to the priestly officials. Even if the girls who participated at the Brauronia as arktoi could be accommodated at the sanctuary this would not be evidence for ritual seclusion; as many would presumably come from far off it might be simply a practical measure. Neither would it prove that the divinities of the sanctuary exercised a direct protective influence over children. Consequently it is far from clear whether the numerous statuettes found at Brauron representing boys are to be interpreted as offerings by mothers for their children's health, or as dedications commemorative in some way of boys who had themselves spent some time at the sanctuary. It has even been claimed, apparently on the basis of no more evidence than this, that the children of mothers who died in childbirth could live at the sanctuary under the protection of Iphigeneia.95 The other, less dramatic, explanation of the statuettes would seem no less plausible. In this case Iphigeneia and Artemis would still concern themselves with the protection of children, whether male or female, as we would expect, but as and when occasion arose, at the request of the mother. We turn next to the connexion of Iphigeneia (and inseparably, of the Brauronian Artemis) with the actual event of birth, a connexion we might already expect from the heroine's name. Here our evidence is fortunately more direct. We are told in literary sources that the clothes of women who died in childbirth were dedicated to Iphigeneia (E. IT 1464-7) and that surviving women dedicated their clothes to Artemis (scholia to Callimachus, Hymn 1 .77). In one of the most important recent studies of the cult, I. Kondis, following a suggestion in Preller-Robert,96 deduces from this that there was a rigid separation of functions in the sanctuary: Iphigeneia, who received the dead women's clothes, was patroness of women who died in childbirth, and Artemis, to whom survivors dedicated their garments, presided over safe deliveries. But while the dedications in these circumstances certainly imply a close relation between the woman undergoing one of her life's most critical experiences and the goddess or heroine, this rigid contrast of divine and heroic patronage can scarcely be inferred with safety. It is nowhere explicitly stated, and the scholiast to Callimachus is not even referring to Artemis Brauronia in particular; if he is talking about any particular Artemis, rather than Artemis in general, it should be Artemis Chitone at Miletos. Neither do the inventories (IG II2 1514-31, found on the Athenian acropolis, although probably referring to the sanctuary at Brauron) give much assistance in the matter.97 The donors appear all to be women, and so it seems a fairly secure inference that many of the dedications will be thank-offerings for a safe delivery, even if some may have been made in other circumstances. But they give no precise indication of the cause for the dedication, nor, in most cases, of the recipient. Although, as I shall argue, it is possible 91 See C. Börker, Gnomon 41 (1969) 806; J. J.

All we can safely say is that Iphigeneia, like Artemis, stands in a close relation to women giving birth. The second and more spectacular feature of the cult, the ritual of the arkteia, has also generally been acknowledged to be in some way connected with birth, though the relationship between the ritual performed and the presumed function is by no means as clear as one would like - much less so than in the case of the Arrephoria, for example. The evidence for the practice and the myths derives chiefly from Aristophanes, Lysistrata 645 and its scholia.98 At first sight the ritual of small girls dressed in saffron imitating a bear, because once a bear was killed at the sanctuary, seems unfathomable. Myth and ritual cohere comfortably in this pattern, but .it is hard to relate them to any function or further end. What was the ritual intended to achieve, consciously or unconsciously? The question is most easily approached by comparing the arkteia with other rituals. We are told in some sources that a law was introduced (when, is not stated) compelling girls to perform the arkteia before marriage, and it seems that at the very least it could be thought de rigueur A ritual to be performed by girls before marriage would seem to belong in the same category as the Arrephoria; these are acts which must be performed before the girl experiences sex, and hence childbirth. The arkteia would then be a ritual of initiatory, or perhaps rather placatory, character, intended to ensure that all went well with the girl when she approached the ëpya yuvaiK&amp;v. There is explicit ancient evidence for placatory actions performed for Artemis (at this festival or some other?) é&lt;p' àcpoCTiòoei xfiç Jtapúevíaç, |j.fļ ve|iecrr|ť&gt;á)aiv vn' avríiç, |{K) and it is also clear from a fragment of Menander that the pains and dangers of childbirth could be regarded as Artemis' punishment for lost virginity."" This belief finds its mythical expression in the story of Kallisto, whom Artemis, in anger at her pregnancy, killed while she was in the act of giving birth. That the arkteia was a placatory ritual is stated by the Suda (s.v. apicroç iļ Bpaupoovíoiç); the arktoi are there described as àitoneiXicroónevai tiļv ůeáv. If the only myth connected with this ritual were that of Iphigeneia's sacrifice at Brauron102 the pattern would now be relatively straightforward. This sacrificial death, though complicated by epic and patriotic elements, has an obvious relation to the death which the young girls are 98 See n. 91. Both Brelich and Sale, obviously rightly, include references to the related cult and myths of Artemis Mounychia and the daughter of Embaros. The cult of Artemis Tauropolos, celebrated at Halai Araphenides on the coast near Brauron, is also in some way to be related, as Euripides makes clear in his parallel aetiologies (IT 1450-67), but we are less well informed about it. The form of a human sacrifice just averted was a part of this cult also, but from the tradition of Orestes as first institutor it would seem that it had a more masculine character than the cults of Brauron or perhaps Mounychia, although women and girls took part in some of the celebrations (Menander, Epitrepontes fr. 6 (Koerte) 295-9 etc.). P. H. J. Lloyd-Jones, JHS 103 (1983) 87-102, esp. 96-7. suggests that the Tauropolia were an initiation rite for boys parallel to that of the Brauronia for girls. 99 As Suda s.v. fxpKtoç rļ BpaupMVÍoiç. There is a late fourth-century Cyrenaean parallel for the official imposition of similar obligations, again for women in the cult of Artemis: LSS 1I5.BI-23. But it is hard to imagine that in practice all free unmarried girls from the large territory of Attica were taken to Brauron for this event. Aristophanes seems to think the performance an honour, or at least evidence of a life of luxury (x^iSctxrav. Ar. Lys. 640; but the precise nuance is difficult to catch). Legal compulsion could, of course, have been introduced in the fourth century or even later. 100 'To make expiation for their (loss of) virginity, so that she does not take vengeance on them', schol.

The act which they perform, connected in some way with its mythical exemplar in the death of Iphigeneia, would then be some sort of ritual death designed to placate the goddess and avoid death in reality - in childbirth. The bear, which appears in both Mounychian and Brauronian versions (though in ritual only, apparently, at Brauron), seems difficult to fit into this pattern. However, it is clear that the two stories, of Iphigeneia and of the bear, are linked by common elements, and the cult-legends of Artemis Mounychia have clear points of contact with both the Brauronian stories.101 We may thus posit an original form of the story in which the girl, whether known as Iphigeneia or, as at Mounychia, as Embaros' daughter, is sacrificed, or on the point of being sacrificed, as propitiation for the death of Artemis' sacred bear. The command to imitate the bear would represent the not uncommon mythical commutation of the original death sentence. In the myth, then, Artemis demands the death of a girl as satisfaction for the death of a creature sacred to her. How does this correspond to real experience? The explanation may not be simple: we may have a conflation of two or more patterns of thought. The tradition of a sense of wrongdoing, indicated by divine displeasure, in the killing of an animal, poses an almost irresistible temptation for the student of Greek religion, and Lloyd- Jones has suggested that the ritual of the arkteia should be seen against the background of Karl Meuli's theory of sacrifice as springing from primitive hunting ritual, whereby the hunters, animated by feelings of fear and guilt because of the killing they have performed, attempt to placate the slaughtered animal by offering him back part of himself. If the beast, or at a later stage the divinity who presides over and protects wild beasts, is not thus satisfied, dire consequences will no doubt follow."" In very general terms, this follows the same scheme of equivalent sacrifice as the myths of Brauron and of Mounychia. It can also be linked with the theme of death in childbirth, this being the specific consequence caused by the unappeased Artemis as mistress of animals. In revenge for the excessive killing of wild beasts, which are her special concern, Artemis will send infertility and death upon the hunters' women and children. The ritual of the arkteia is then an attempt to avoid these consequences. This explanation of the rite's essential function will certainly explain the demand for a propitiatory, equivalent sacrifice very neatly, but in it two important factors seem to have been reduced to insignificance. Firstly, the slaughter of the bear does not correspond exactly to the pattern of sacrificial guilt seen at its clearest in the ritual of the Bouphonia: it is an important difference that the bear is a wild animal, far removed from the domesticated ox which assists humankind to feed innocently on grain, and certainly far from the sort of animal, again usually domesticated, offered in sacrifice. The bear-killing and consequent retribution may be close to the patterns of hunter-gatherer society, but it is importantly different from the norms of Greek polis religion. Secondly, the element of virginity, which is clearly an important ritual demand, seems to have been reduced to unimportance - the arkteia is here merely a once-for-all act performed before the girl can be at risk. Perhaps we should add to the 'hunting' explanation those ancient testimonia which view death in childbirth as the punishment not for the hunting activities of the menfolk but for the woman's own loss of virginity. To the woman brought up (for whatever reason) to put a high value in her own virginity, its loss is a traumatic, ambiguous event; virginity is the girl's greatest treasure, to be preserved at all costs - until the moment when it suddenly becomes desirable and necessary to throw it away. The tension between these Sale, art. cit. (n. 91). I,u P. H. J. Lloyd-Jones. JHS 103 (1983) 87-102.</page><page sequence="38">THE HERO AND THE INDIVIDUAL 3 1 seemingly opposite imperatives is a theme of wedding songs.105 What more natural than that the woman, somehow believing despite her knowledge of the contrary that the consummation of her marriage is a betrayal of everything she had been taught, should regard childbirth, particularly if difficult or dangerous - and it must always have been recognised as potentially fatal - as the vengeance of the power which gave divine sanction to the need to preserve virginity? In this scheme the girl stands in precisely the same relation to Artemis as does the bear; she is not simply the equivalent sacrifice demanded by the goddess of wild things, a creature from the domesticated world of men (like the sacrificial goat) in exchange for one from the wilds. Rather, she is herself in a certain sense a wild creature, under Artemis' protection - while she remains a virgin. Magical, special powers are very commonly attributed to virgins in societies in other ways quite diverse; 106 the virgin in a sense stands apart, as a woman who has not fulfilled a woman's role within society. Because of this, she may be viewed like the bear as part of the other world, the wild and unordered realms over which Artemis presides; we recall the commmon metaphor of the 'yoke' of marriage (as applied to a woman, of course) and the clear derivation of the word Scxjxap, 'wife', from the root 5oc|li-, 'tame'.107 The two aspects of Artemis' patronage of the wild and untamed are brought into closer connexion in the mythological tradition requiring chastity of hunters, whether male or female.108 From this angle, the killing of a bear, considered perhaps simply as the (once) commonest and most representative large wild animal, perhaps also in some ways the most human, and the deflowering of a virgin may both alike be considered infringements of Artemis' wild domain - except that the former virgin may be considered to have consented to the offence concerning herself. The punishment falls both on her and on the society which sanctions the offence; childbirth has both individual and communal aspects. Here the girl is directly equivalent to the bear whose slaughter is equivalent to the loss of virginity; this is a different pattern from that shown by the myths, which speak of a sacrificial equivalence. 105 Most clearly seen in the amoebean structure of Catullus 62, surely using traditional imagery. The girls see no distinction between the deflowering (in this word we still preserve the traditional comparison!) of a virgin in lawful marriage and on the capture of a city (line 62). Commentators miss half the point here. Regret for lost virginity (physical or social status, or both?) is also expressed in Sappho 1 13. 11)6 See Nock, Essays 1.14 n. 60. 107 Cf. J. P. Gould, J HS 100 (1980) 53. ,0K See P. Vidal-Naquet, 'The Black Hunter and the Origin of the Athenian Ephebia', most recent version in Vidal- Naquet, The Black Hunter; Forms of Thought and Forms of Society in the Greek World (Baltimore 1986) 106-28. Hunters, both male and female, are very often in myth required to be chaste, a fact which cannot of course be explained simply in terms of the vengeance exacted by the TCÓtvia drļpcov in childbirth. Rather, as Vidal-Naquet hints, we should see this requirement in terms of the opposition between the wild and the domesticated. Sex may be viewed as an act of normality, as it were a social act, one which is expected of the ordinary member of society and one, most importantly, by which the community is perpetuated (cf. again the wedding-songs: Cat. 61.66-75). In Greek society, the primary, almost the only, function of a woman is sexual and reproductive; a virgin is, then, an anomaly who must necessarily stand outside society, in a sense. In the case of males, who may fulfil many other functions, the anomaly is less felt, although boys without experience of sex are sometimes required in the same sort of magical context as are girls, and temporary chastity may still be a means for a man to set himself apart from society (Nock, Essays 1.7-15), and is required of those who as hunters would venture into the domain of the wild. (We recall that it is the wildness of the activity, rather than the chase, which is expressed in the commonly used word ocypa.) The fate of those mythical hunters like Orion who attempt to violate the virgin goddess expresses the fate feared by those who disregard this requirement. However, excessive or seriously irregular sexual activity places its agent outside the normal framework of society exactly as does chastity, and this may account in part for such motifs in hunting-myths (thus Atalanta and Melanion. Kephalos and Prokris). On the subject in general, see in addition to Vidal-Naquet 'above), M. Detienne. Dionysos Slain (Baltimore. 1979) ( = Dionysos mis à mort , Paris 1977) 25-6, and J. Fontenrose, Orion: the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress (U. Cal. Pubns. in Class. Studies 23, Berkeley and Los Angeles 1981). The placation of Artemis before marriage is paralleled by the Troizenian custom of girls dedicating their hair before marriage to the chaste hunter Hippolytos: E. Hipp. 1425-7.</page><page sequence="39">32 THE HEROES OF ATTICA A further possible strand in this extremely complicated picture may relate to the particular reputation of the bear. The association of bears and Artemis recurs, after all, at Cyrene, where àpKoç (bear) is evidently the name of a priestess (LSS 1 15 B16); here, as in Attica, the cult has evidently a special connexion with marriage and childbirth. It may then be relevant that Greek animal lore, as reported in Aristotle, appears to lay particular stress on the reproductive habits of the she-bear. Female bears, like bitches, are particularly savage when they have young, and when pregnant they are very hard to catch; the latter point is made twice. "w They are, then, excellent protectors of their young, a good model for the human female. If this has any connexion with the childbirth-orientated cult of the arkteia, then again the girl would seem to be directly equivalent to the bear. By imitating a bear she would become more like it, and hence provide for herself the protection which Artemis bestows on bears, but less often on humans, in the act of parturition. This explanation will not on its own suffice to explain all aspects of the arkteia, but like the previous two it may be a part of the input into the formation of the complex of Brauronian myth and ritual. It goes some way to explaining the place of the bear, rather than some other animal, while the other strands explain rather more the placatory character of the ritual, designed as it seems to be to avert the goddess's present or future anger, to prevent her from being a 'lion to women'. Consideration of the nature of the arkteia as a whole, much discussed though it has been already,110 has necessarily led us some way from our starting-point with Iphigeneia. The presence of the heroine within the complex seems ambivalent. O" the one hand she is very close to the goddess herself, having clearly similar functions as kourotrophos ; but she has also a more human and heroic role, as the model apparently both for officials of the cult and for the arktoi. Whether Iphigeneia was originally an independent entity or merely an aspect of Artemis is not clear, but the latter hypothesis is perhaps the more likely; the name Iphigeneia appears elsewhere than in Attica, so she cannot have been a purely local deity.1" Neither does it seem likely that a personage with an apparently clear Greek name can have been a once widespread, pre-Greek deity. Whatever the earlier position, it is clear enough that at Brauron in historical times Iphigeneia was separate from Artemis, though not, perhaps, by much. Elsewhere, the name Iphigeneia appears as an epithet of Artemis, and she is said to have been made immortal by the goddess, becoming a sort of Artemis herself."2 Wè find Iphigeneia worshipped as at Brauron in a precinct of Artemis at Aigeira in Achaia.1" The connexion with childbirth is central to Iphigeneia, as indeed is suggested by her name, which to the Greeks of the classical period would denote 'strong birth'."4 Nicander identified her with a goddess Orsilochia, 'causer of birth-pangs'. It seems possible, then, that originally Iphigeneia was not a heroine but simply a childbirth Artemis. In this connexion, it is interesting to note a double cult of Artemis 109 Arist. Hist.

In the developed form of the cult, we see Iphigeneia acting like a goddess in her reception of dead women's clothes. No attempt seems to be made to provide an aetiological explanation for this - clearly it was not because she herself died in childbirth. It is a custom akin to divine offerings, not to be explained by a tradition about the heroine's life. It would be surprising if Iphigeneia did not also share Artemis' kourotrophic functions, but a full exploration of this role will have to await the further publication of the excavation material. Like most heroes, however, she combines these functions as superhuman power with a role as prototype of the human participants in the rituals of the sanctuary. Here too we may compare her as a sacral heroine to the daughters of Kekrops, and we find the same ambiguity in the nature of the correspondence. Is it some permanent officiant (analogous to the priestess of Athena Polias) or is it the arktoi (= arrephoroi) who correspond in real life to the mythical Iphigeneia? We know little of the priestly officiants of the cult,"6 but we do know that Iphigeneia was the first KÂ.11ÔOÛXOÇ (that is, probably, priestess) at Brauron, and we can hardly doubt that later priestesses regarded themselves as her successors, just as the performers of the Plynteria seem to have been the successors of Aglauros."7 On the other hand, the various forms of the arkteia- myth, confused though they seem, clearly demand the correspondence of the arktoi with Iphigeneia (or the nameless girl of the bear story, which in this case amounts to the same thing). Like her they are young girls performing a propitiatory sacrifice to Artemis, probably involving a ritual death, reflected in the myth of Iphigeneia's sacrifice. Properly speaking, then, Iphigeneia has two distinct roles, as divine power and as human paradigm, the latter with two applications. It may be doubted, however, to what extent the paradigm function continued to matter, at least as far as the arktoi are concerned. It is far from clear that the identification between Iphigeneia and the girl who played with the bear was made in classical times, and the relationship between bears, childbirth, and the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter is scarcely obvious. The heavy inlay of epic materials in Iphigeneia's case is quite enough to complicate the picture. The mythical representation of Aglauros and Pandrosos as the daughters of Kekrops is quite simple and straightforward. Kekrops has only local significance, however important he might be in Athens, but Iphigeneia strays into a world of panhellenic saga with her appearance as Agamemnon's daughter. However, it is clear enough that the triumph of this version is relatively late. Homer knows nothing of the sacrifice at Aulis. His Agamemnon has a daughter Iphianassa, still living during the siege.118 For the Cypria we have only indirect evidence, but if we can take the testimonia at face value, the epic narrated the sacrificial death of Iphigeneia."9 This could then be the earliest occurrence of the familiar story with the familiar participants, but it was not the version known to the poet (perhaps sixth-century) of the Catalogue of Women ; there we have the same story, but the daughter's name is Iphimede. This character is 1 15 Paus. 9. 19.6. There were two statues, one carrying torches, one in the form of a huntress, but only one altar. 1 16 It is clear at least that a priestess was the main officiant; see Linders, op. cit. 52-3, 73 n. 40. At Mounychia, on the other hand, the myth of the sacrifice performed by Embaros would seem to suggest a male priest, which is not uncommon in cults of Artemis. For the Tauropolos cult see n. 98. 117 E. IT 1464-7. 118 Iliad 9. 145, 287. 1 19 Cypria fr. 12 K and Proclus, Chrestomathia (Kinkel p. 19). The date is uncertain, but the Cypria seems at least to be later than some parts of the epic cycle: J. Griffin, JHS 97 (1977) 39 n. 9.</page><page sequence="41">34 THE HEROES OF ATTICA clearly related to our Iphigeneia, perhaps a local variant, in her quasi-divine status; Artemis, remarkably, causes her to become Artemis Enodia.12" Just as Agamemnon's daughter is not always called Iphigeneia, so conversely Iphigeneia is not always Agamemnon's daughter. A persistent undercurrent of tradition, first attested in Stesichorus ( PMG 191), makes her the daughter of Helen and Theseus. This, although it reaches no closer to Iphigeneia's original nature, should be, as Wilamowitz saw, the earlier Attic form of the myth, and both parents have connexions with eastern Attica.121 We are led to suppose that the 'vulgate' - Agamemnon's daughter Iphigeneia, sacrificed at Aulis, priestly official and heroine at Brauron - results from a combination and systématisation of two very similar cults and myths, the one based on Aulis, the other at Brauron. To make this clearer: the Brauronian cult is, as we have seen, connected with a ritual, propitiatory death. Parallel with the bear-story, this gives rise, as so often, to the story of a human sacrifice, perhaps just averted. The victim is a young girl, appropriate both for the ritual of the arkteia and for Artemis in general. A version survives in which the sacrifice of Iphigeneia actually takes place at Brauron.122 We must suppose an exactly similar development took place at Aulis with its double cult of Artemis. In both cases, the victim, as well as merging with one aspect of the goddess, was provided with a genealogy, becoming at Aulis Agamemnon's daughter and at Brauron, one supposes, Helen's in the first instance. Here the circumstance of her identification with an 'immortal power' (àflávaxoç ôaí|Kov, Ant. Lib. 27) was regularised by her becoming a heroine. As the last stage in the process, the two myths become contaminated, combining to produce the vulgate, even in Attica (as Aeschylus and Euripides, for instance). It is tempting to conjecture Peisistratid influence in the formation of this version; the expansion in the late sixth century of the chief cult of their own part of Attica is usually associated with Peisistratid rule, and it was no doubt advantageous to ensure a respectable and unimpeachably epic origin for the associated heroine. (We may recall the rhapsodic recitals, another Peisistratid favourite, at Brauron; with such elements we seem to be moving away from a women's festival to a more 'polis-oriented', even 'political' celebration, but as with most festivals many different elements and significances will have been present.121) Odd variations in the myth survived until a very late date, but the normal version of the story, with its sanction in drama, must have been very influential; Iphigeneia the innocent victim of Agamemnon's lust for glory, or the heroic young girl who gives her life for the greater good of Greece - these are rather far removed from the Iphigeneia who received her reward by serving the goddess at Brauron, the story's reconciliation with the cultic connexions. It seems more likely that if in the fifth century and later Iphigeneia was consciously seen as an exemplar of anything it was of patriotic self-sacrifice, not as a model for the participants in a picturesque ritual whose precise meaning was obscure. As a power, as a sort of Artemis, she presumably continued to have 120 Hesiod fr. 23 M-W: see F. Solmsen, AJP 102 (1981) 353-8. The Mycenaean /pemedeja is usually transcribed 'Icpipe&amp;ia, Gérard-Rousseau 1 16-8. 121 Hermes 18 (1883) 249. The eastern coast and the Mesogeia, everything east of Hymettos and Pentelikon, may be taken as forming an approximate unity. It is roughly in this area that we can trace the Attic Helen. The story of her rape by Theseus (Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 18) places her in Aphidna, a tradition which gives more credibility to the source which calls her daughter of Rhamnousian Nemesis ( Cypria fr. 6 K, cf. Callim. Hymn 3.232). At the other extremity of the eastern coast, she is worshipped with the Anakes (identified with her brothers the Dioskouroi) at Thorikos (lines 37-8, cf. Eust. Od. 1.399). Brauron is situated between Rhamnous and Thorikos. Theseus' connexions are rather more with the north-east - Aphidna and Marathon - and of course also with the Megarid. 122 Seen. 102. 123 Rhapsodes: Hsych. s.v. Bpa'&gt;p(ovíoiç.

But there must have been an uncomfortable rift between this Iphigeneia and the Iphigeneia of drama. Although he is emphatically not a woman's hero (or god), Herakles cannot escape comment in a consideration of hero(ine)-kourotrophoi. He is well known as the patron of youth; we meet him in this role most obviously among the ephebes and in the gymnasium.124 Particularly striking is his presence at the ceremony where the ephebes cut their hair; here they offer him a special libation given its own technical term of oivtaxtipia.125 But perhaps unsurprisingly Herakles was apparently also concerned with younger children. Thus it may be significant for the character of the festival of the Herakleia at Porthmos, over which the Salaminioi presided, includes a preliminary sacrifice to Kourotrophos (as usual, with no further designation). Indeed, it seems as though the whole family group here worshipped with Herakles may share this function. Herakles' marriage to Hebe is well known - but it is not merely a symbolic expression of his love for youth, for Hebe herself is an object of worship, receiving cult at a major sanctuary at Aixone (and outside Attica, in Phleious, where she was also known as Ganymeda).126 One may conjecture that Alkmene as Herakles' mother had the care of children at heart (even her difficulty in giving birth may indicate a function as helper of women in labour), and Ioleos, who receives quite a lot of cult in Attica, being Herakles' nephew and younger companion might well express his interest in youth.127 Following these lines, we could interpret the festival of Porthmos as 'kourotrophic', and this would provide support for Nilsson's suggestion that the apparently anomalous Maia in this group is not Maia the mother of Hermes at all; she is just |¿aía, the nurse, who perhaps cared for the young Herakles or his children.128 Such a figure is known in Thebes in the person of Galinthias or Galanthis, who in several different versions aided Alkmene's difficult birth-pangs and looked after her child Herakles.129 Galinthias was a real enough figure in Thebes to receive sacrifice at a festival of Herakles there, but we do not know whether the tradition was familiar in Attica as well. A further indication of Herakles' caring for children comes from the unidentified city Herakleion where were dedicated the votives IG II2 4611-3, all of the late fourth century.110 This may have been the sanctuary of Herakles Menytes, or the Alexikakos at Melite, or some other sanctuary unattested in literary sources. The most interesting dedication is 4613 (= EM 8793, pl. IB); the inscription reads 'Lysistrate dedicated (this) to Herakles for her children' (Awiorporai íwtèp t&amp;v jiouôícdv 'HpatcÀtí dtvediļice), while the relief depicts what seems to be a family group with a sacrificial animal approaching the altar, where is standing Herakles, depicted in accordance with convention with the lionskin around his body. The group of worshippers consists of a row of four figures of descending height, with two children in front of the two tallest figures, which are nearest to Herakles. To some extent this is a stock design, and though no doubt the figures were used to represent Lysistrate 's family, we need not suppose 124 Herakles and youth: Woodford, Cults of Herakies 214; R.

But the relief would not have been chosen by Lysistrate had it been completely inappropriate, and its designer at any rate included a clear Herakles. So we may attach some significance to the fact that there are two female figures among the worshippers: Lysistrate and a daughter, presumably, so that the 'children' included girls. Herakles' protection of the young extended, interestingly, to both sexes. This might not have been expected from the exclusively male character of the ephebeia and the gymnasium, or from those cults of Herakles (like the Misogynos at Phokis)111 which exclude women. But we are here dealing with children, and it is often, though not always, the case that among the young before their marriage differences of sex are immaterial in religious practice. Girls and boys are to some extent interchangeable; the most striking example, perhaps, is the complete indifference (at least in later times) to the sex of fhe 'child initiated from the (city's) hearth' (itaíç á&lt;p' éatíaç ni)T|deíç(a)) at Eleusis.112 Some rituals, indeed, involving children, such as the Arrephoria, demand children of a particular sex; this is because they are broadly speaking rites of initiation and have reference to the future life of the child as adult man or woman. But in their present state, before the formal recognition of of adult status, children are, in a sense, sexless; they are more child than male or female, and therefore boys and girls are in need of the same type of protection. This, as far as it concerns Herakles, is reflected on the mythological plane, since in mythology Herakles has no reason to hate his virgin daughter Makaria, but only his wife Deianeira. The role of Herakles, then, in child care forms a much closer parallel with the action of the healing heroes than is the case with Iphigeneia and the daughters of Kekrops. He is both given regular sacrifice in a kourotrophic context and appealed to in cases of individual need. Iphigeneia, too, may have concerned herself with the care of individual children, and the dedication to her of the clothes of women who had died in childbirth is also of course an individual act. But since in Greek society childbirth was almost a universal feminine experience, and the production of children concerned the city as well as the individual, ceremonies connected with childbirth were often directed at group level, at women as the female half of the community, not as individuals. Because they were expressed in this social manner, the forms of the ritual inevitably crystallized and became hard to understand. In consequence the kourotrophic role of the heroines who featured in these rituals was not always understood, and other functions came to predominate; they are sacral heroines, with reference only to the rite itself, or (as with the daughters of Kekrops) they may evoke the quintessential polis of Athens itself in the country demes. The lesser heroines of the countryside, being more akin to nymphs, may well have retained more of a conscious kourotrophic function. 3. Seafaring heroes A third sizeable group of Attic heroes who help individuals is provided by those heroes connected with the sea, naturally enough in an area with such an extensive coastline. Although the practice of making dedications in thanks for escape from shipwreck could hardly be better documented throughout the ancient world,1" there is in this case little direct evidence that those heroes located on the coast, particularly at conspicuous points, have a function in helping 1,1 Plut. Mor. 403F. 132 See K. Clinton, The sacred officials of the Eleusinian mysteries (Philadelphia 1974) 98-1 14. 133 On the religious aspects of seafaring, see D. Wachsmuth, nÓ1i7ti|Lioç ó Saiļucov (Berlin 1967).</page><page sequence="44">THE HERO AND THE INDIVIDUAL 37 people, and at first sight they might appear to stand in a closer relation with the patron-heroes of springs, gates and so on, than with the healers and kourotrophoi. Poseidon and the Dioskouroi, other deities too, in Attica as elsewhere, are far better attested in this capacity than the minor, local hero.114 But the coastal heroes cannot exist in a vacuum, and as the gate- heroes very often have a function as guardians and protectors, so too, we might suppose, heroes of the sea could exercise a protective function in their own sphere. As with the two groups previously considered, this sphere is primarily of individual import. Seafaring, except of course for military purposes, was entirely an individual activity, pursued for individual ends. Until fairly recently, like childbirth, it was also one of the most dangerous of activities frequently indulged in. Unlike childbirth, however, it was scarcely an inevitable experience for either sex, and consequently we do not expect to find in connexion with sailing the elaborate and prophylactic ceremonies, designed to apply once for all, like the Arrephoria and the Brauronian rites, which apply in the former case. Neither of course does the sea voyage present anything like the emotional complexity of the change of status from virgin to married woman and mother. We should expect, then, that the greater part of the cult received by such seafaring heroes as might exist would be sporadic and directed towards a particular occasion. But if this is so, evidence is lacking. All that we possess is the details of certain shrines, and the knowledge of certain stated sacrifices. Sosineos For our purposes the significance of this hero from the Thorikos calendar is summed up in his name. Early versions of the calendar read the name of the hero immediately following Sosineos as 'Po&lt;fl&gt;icoi, which ought to refer to the waves as they break on the shore; it would then be natural to take the two heroes closely together, giving us a pair of sea heroes, one with a purely descriptive name, the other named functionally. Unfortunately it is now quite clear that the stone reads 'Poyicoi, which defies interpretation and removes the foundation for the idea of a pair of heroes. The format of the calendar does not permit us to see whether Sosineos should be placed in a sacrifice group together with some or all of the heroes who surround him: Hyperpedios and his heroines, Thras-, Nisos, Rhogios, Pylouchos and his heroines, so the character of the festival, if it can be so called, at which he received his sheep can scarcely be determined. Nonetheless, the hero's name clearly reveals his function, no doubt a continued one, as protector of ships and sailors. Whether he had very much personality or history remains doubtful; the name concentrates on the essentials. Sosineos is in fact known as a divine epithet, being applied to Poseidon in an inscription from Pantikapaion; of course no divine element need be involved at Thorikos.115 In fact Sosineos is a hero on a very humble level, of local significance only. However, it is significant that his cult is important enough to be regularised by the deme; he is not merely invoked by individuals in cases of specific need, he is also the recipient of regular annual sacrifice, presumably at deme expense. The month Thargelion, when the sacrifice is due, falls in the middle of the sailing season, and the sacrifice is presumably designed to ensure the continuing favour of the local hero for local fishermen and other sailors. It seems quite likely that many of the coastal demes maintained cults of similar heroes. 154 See W. D. Rouse, Greek Votive Offerings (Cambridge 1902) 228-31. 155 Laty sehe v II 25.</page><page sequence="45">38 THE HEROES OF ATTICA The Phaleron group More complicated are the problems surrounding a group of heroes (probably rather loosely constituted) at Phaleron, or in the general Phaleron area. Much of the confusion stems from the varying accounts of heroes at Phaleron given in different sources, and from the uncertain identification of a seemingly related sacrifice group in the Salaminioi decree. If we accept this identification, the group should probably be reconstructed as follows: a nameless fípcoç (sometimes identified with Androgeos son of Minos), Nauseiros/Nausithoös, Phaiax, Phaleros and perhaps others connected with Theseus.136 Nearby were Teukros and Skiros and the divine sanctuaries of Poseidon Hippodromios, Athena Skiras, and the òr/viooToi ťteoí. The Unknown Gods, together with Athena Skiras, and to a large extent Skiros, do not really concern us here. The others have a clear nautical flavour; but what, precisely, is their function, and how do they relate to one another? We may conveniently take as our starting-point the festival of the Kybernesia which, according to Philochorus ( FGrH 328 F 111), was celebrated at Phaleron for Nausithoös and Phaiax, icußepvrjTriq and npcppeiiç respectively of Theseus. The identification of Nausithoös with the epigraphically attested Nauseiros has been generally accepted, and this festival has thus been brought into connexion with the sacrifice performed by the Salaminioi in Boedromion (towards the end of the sailing season) to Poseidon Hippodromios, Nauseiros, Teukros and Phaiax (lines 90-2). Jacoby's arguments in his commentary on the Philochorus passage against such a connexion do not seem to be conclusive.137 Nevertheless it is likely that, as Ferguson argues, although the official Kybernesia had some connexion with Poseidon 136 The sources: chiefly Fausanias 1.1.4, supplemented by Philochorus FGrH 328 Fill, and by the sacrifice in the Salaminioi inscription, 90-2. The problems raised by these sources are so involved that it may be easiest to set out the information in tabular form: Cult Location Source Nausithoös and Phaiax Phaleron, near Skiros Philoch. 1 1 1 Nauseiros, Teukros, Phaiax, no place given, perhaps Echelidai Salaminioi decree Poseidon Hippodromios Anonymous hero, Phaleros, Phaleron Paus. 1 . 1 .4 unknown gods, heroes, sons (or associates) of Theseus, Athena Skiras flpcûç Korca 7tp'i&gt;ļjvav Phaleron Clem. Protr. 2.20.2, Callimachus fr. 103 Pf. The heroes associated with Theseus are probably Akamas and Demophon; see below. On Nauseiros and Phaiax, see S. Eitrem, 'Heroen der Seefahrer', Symb. Osi. 14 (1935) 53-67. 137 FGrH HIB Suppl. I 347 n. 9. Nausithoös/Nauseiros is an acceptable variation (see below), while the puzzling appearance of Teukros between Nauseiros and Phaiax is perhaps explicable in terms of the rather different character of a genos-festival. It is true that no location is given, but Teukros (below) and Phaiax should be in the general surroundings of Phaleron, and the area is well-known as a place of cult activity for the Salaminioi. Ferguson ( Hesp . 1 (1938) 25) suggests that Poseidon Hippodromios is named from his proximity to the hippodrome in Echelidai, some way from Phaleron proper but still part of the general area. (Benton's theory that Echelidai is in fact located near Kolonos need not detain us: see Appendix 1 s.v. Echelos.) In fact these topographical links, together with the Thesean connexions of all this group, might seem rather to supply positive evidence for the Salaminioi at work here. Teukros is connected in myth with Xypete, not Echelidai (Phanodemus FGrH 325 F 13), and we might expect the noKhxx T£K|iīļpia of the text to include cult. This is not an insuperable topographical problem, since it appears that the deme Xypete lies between Echelidai and Phaleron proper (Westermanns grosser Atlas zur Weltgeschichte (Berlin 1965) 12), while Plutarch in quoting Philochorus might have described either of these demes loosely as Phaleron to make his meaning clearer to a panhellenic audience. The four shrines in the Salaminioi sacrifice need not have been contiguous, since sacrifices could be linked by a procession.</page><page sequence="46">THE HERO AND THE INDIVIDUAL 39 Hippodromios, they were celebrated by the genos of the Phoinikes rather than the Salaminioi.138 If this is correct, we would apparently have two stated sacrifices for a similar group of navigational heroes: one a public and recognised festival, whose management could be claimed by the deme of Phaleron, the other a more private, gentile affair organised by a group who added to the others a family hero of their own, Teukros.11'' A state of affairs which may have led to some tension (and there was tension certainly between the Phoinikes and the deme in the Hippodromios cult), but which is by no means impossible. Here again, we find regularised and general sacrifice well established. It seems unreasonable to doubt that these heroes, either individually or as a group, exercised a protective function towards those sailing from Phaleron. But other factors are involved; the old port of Athens is in a different position from a little township on the east coast, like Thorikos. More specifically, the significance of these heroes is transformed by the introduction of mythological factors. The identification of a nameless seafaring hero as a Phaeacian (still without individual name) is to be explained in very general terms as expressing a desire to give heroes a definite personality, and indicative of the pervasive force in this direction of the epic and associated traditions. To anyone familiar with the Odyssey, the Phaeacians were the seafaring people par excellence of the heroic age, once especially favoured by Poseidon.140 Nauseiros, on the other hand, however we interpret the etymology,141 is clearly a functional name of the same type as Sosineos. 'Nausithoös' in Philochorus is obviously to be explained by the Odyssean reference (7.55-63) which names him as son of Poseidon and father of Alkinoös: it is an obvious Phaeacian name.142 It is not necessary to suppose that the Odyssean name is either mistake or conjecture on Philochorus' part, or the result of corruption or emendation in the literary tradition; it is quite possible that this name existed alongside Nauseiros as alternative appellations for the same hero, the Salaminioi perhaps using one form, the Phoinikes the other. If genuine, the use of the Odyssean name shows the process of furnishing heroes with a mythical personality carried one stage further. But these Odyssean connexions are only barely compatible - though explanations could, no doubt, be produced - with the tradition given in Philochorus, which makes the two heroes the Salaminian navigators of Theseus, sent with him by king Skiros. We can hardly doubt that this is the work of the Salaminioi, integrating their own figures into the saga of the greatest of Attic heroes.141 They achieve precisely the same with their management of the Oschophoria, another festival of Phaleron with Thesean connexions. Thus the mythological development is not so much connected with the clarification of the heroes' protecting function as it is part of an 138 The cult of this Poseidon was contested in the fourth century between the Phoinikes and the deme (Dinarchus fr. 20 Conomis), and the connexion with Nauseiros and Phaiax in the sacrifice of the Salaminioi strongly suggests that Poseidon Hippodromios was the chief deity of the Kybernesia. See Ferguson p. 27. 139 Private genos cults, that is cults in which participation was confined to the genos, are generally assumed to have existed in Attica, but there is in fact no unequivocal evidence for them: see Crux: Essays presented to G. E. M. de Ste Croix (History of Political Thought 6) 205-6. I therefore offer this interpretation with some hesitation. See further p. 53. 140 E.g. Od. 7.34-5. 141 Ferguson (p. 25) suggests 'ship-director', from vaûç and eipco, but this strains the sense of the verb somewhat. 142 In other traditions Nausithoös is the son of Odysseus and Calypso (Hes. Theog. 1017) or of Odysseus and Circe (Hyg .fab. 125). Another motive, then, for the mythological names might be claims of descent; we recall that Andócides claimed descent from Odysseus, although through Telemachus and Nausicaa (Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 24). And Phaiax is of course known as a personal name in Attica, even Phaiax Leodamantos (Laodamas being a son of Alkinoös: see Eitrem, art. cit. 56). 143 According to another tradition, Theseus' steersman was Phereklos Amarsyadas (Simonides, PMC fr. 45 = Plut. Thes. 17.4). But this does not necessarily mean that the other version is. later; Meneleos also had two separate KT_&gt;ßepvr)Tai. The great attract such smaller heroes: see pp. 120-4.</page><page sequence="47">40 THE HEROES OF ATTICA attempt by a genos to clarify its own position. The claim of the Salaminioi to Salaminian descent must stress the sea, while their claim to be Attic is expressed in the close relation of their heroes to Theseus. Comparable is their related sacrifice to Teukros, who perhaps had no part in the official Kybemesia, and whose shrine is not mentioned by Pausanias. As founder of distant Cyprian Salamis, he is certainly a seafaring hero: eras ingens iterabimus aequor. But he is also, of course, uncle of the clan's archegete, Ajax' son Eurysakes. In these cases, then, it is the pressures of a genos and of physical proximity which are formative in the creation of a mythology. The other two heroes present a rather different picture. Phaleros, as eponymous hero of the deme, belongs only with difficulty in the context of a festival organised by a genos.144 But he too, as coloniser with Akamas of Soloi in Cyprus (is there some connexion with Teukros?) is a seafarer.145 It is hardly necessary to suppose that his character has been formed by his neighbours celebrated in the Kybernesia, since the deme's eponym would naturally become a sailing hero at the first stage of endowment with a personality. But here again we come across the connexion with Theseus. Akamas was Theseus' son, and we see him with Phaleros apparently setting out on some mission on a pelike of the Painter of the Birth of Athena (Par. 380.5). This connexion makes it very likely that we should leave the text of Pausanias at this point as it stands: naiStov tôv ©riaecoç, not &lt;ļxexcc&gt; ©T|aéa&gt;ç (Robert), and suppose that there were also altars to Akamas and Demophon in the group. We are now left with the anonymous hero, whom Pausanias states that local experts identify with Androgeos. Once more Theseus, and this time the immediate reason is apparent: it is the connexion of the Oschophoria, Theseus' festival at Phaleron, with the return from Crete. This is learned speculation which is unlikely to have affected the hero's character very much. The name Androgeos has no place in the cult, and a rival theory located* Minos' son in the Kerameikos.146 But Callimachus (fr. 103 Pf) apparently identified Androgeos at Phaleron with a 'hero at the stern', fipax; icata 7tpv&gt;|ivav, thus complicating the issue; without this piece of information we should have expected such a title to belong to Nauseiros/Nausithoös. The extreme solution of identifying all three titles is hardly a possibility, because the Kybernesia and the consequent mythological identifications of Nauseiros and Phaiax were probably still current at the time of Callimachus. Callimachus may have made a slip when perusing his sources on this rather involved group of heroes, which even Pausanias does not list in full. Or perhaps more likely, the description koctò npúnvav really does refer to Pausanias' nameless hero, for whom some further description is presumably necessary on occasion. The connexion with Androgeos represents a final stage of mythological development. Whereas Nauseiros and Phaiax acquire by stages personalities and a myth early enough for them to penetrate into, even to some extent to form, their cult, the fipax; Kata rcpú|¿vav remains 'officially' anonymous, acquiring a mythological character only through the researches of the atthidographers. At all stages except the first, the figure of Theseus is vitally important in determining the character of the myth, and here we can see a number of factors involved: the influence of the local festival, the need and interests of a genos, and the simple desire for a satisfactory historical explanation. It seems likely, however, that the nautical character of the group was formed before the connexion with Theseus. In this respect we cannot rule out the possibility of the influence of some members of this essentially rather disparate group forming the character of others. The 144 This very fact may have given the deme a claim in the ôiaSlKOccría? 145 Strabo 683. 146 Amelesagoras, FGrH 330 F 2 with Jacoby's commentary: cf. perhaps Hesiod fr. 146 M-W.</page><page sequence="48">THE HERO AND THE INDI VIDU AL 41 first stage may have been the festival of the Kybernesia; it seems more reasonable to suppose that this began by having a definite end in view, rather than being merely a commemorative celebration of two of the minor companions of Theseus. The heroes of the festival, then, were not only sailors themselves, but were able to help those at sea, and like Sosineos of Thorikos they received regular sacrifice with this end in view. Themistocles A hero of very different origins seems to have been located in the great harbour of Peiraeus. According to Diodorus the Periegete, who quotes Plato Comicus in support, the bones of Themistocles were brought back to Athens and buried in an 'altarlike tomb' (pto|xoeiSèç xoupoç, Plut. Them. 32.5-6). Clearly this denotes some sort of attempt to claim heroic status for the victor of Salamis, and the idea of 'greeting' in the Plato passage may also be significant (xoîç é|i7tópoiç jcpóapricnç è'axai navxaxoû).147 If this was a hero cult, even one of limited appeal, then it is obviously one which places Themistocles in the ranks of the sailing heroes, although awareness of him as a controversial historical figure must have modified attitudes somewhat. How popular he was we have no means of knowing.148 Phrontis Phrontis was the steersman of Meneleos, who died and was buried at Sounion (Od. 3.278-85): àXX' öte Eoúviov ípòv à(piKÓ|xead', aicpqv Āūtļvetov, è'vûa Kv&gt;Pepviļtr|v Mevetaxou Ooißoq ÄnoKkiüv oîç àyavoîç ßeXeeaaiv ércoixópevoç Kaxéne&lt;pve 7tiļ6aXiov |iexa %epai úeownç vr)òç ěxovta &lt;l&gt;póvxiv 'Ovr|xopí8r|v, ôç èicaívuxo tpúA.' ávdpáwttov vrļa tcußepvf|oai ónóxe cmépxoiev azXkai. &amp;ç ó |xèv êvda Katéc/eť, énevyónevóç nep óÔoío, õ(pp' exapov dánxoi Kaì érti Kxépea íctepíaeiev. But when we reached holy Sounion, the promontory of Athens, there Phoebus Apollo with his gentle arrows fell upon the helmsman of Menelaos and killed him as he held the rudder of the speeding ship in his hands; Phrontis son of Onetor, who excelled the whole race of mankind in steering a ship amid the onslaughts of storms. Thus Menelaos was detained there, eager though he was to go on, so that he might bury his companion and give him grave-goods. There is no completely hard-and-fast evidence for a cult of Phrontis at Sounion, although Picard has made out a generally very persuasive case, based on this passage and on the archaeological evidence.149 Later we shall consider this passage in the context of questions of the epic and the origins of hero-cult; here we need to determine whether a cult existed, and if so whether Phrontis belongs with the same group as the previously discussed heroes, as a helper to those at sea. To prove Phrontis' presence at Sounion, one would prefer some named epigraphic evidence, even a clearer indication of the heroic nature of the shrine, but the case is very much strengthened by the small votive plaque (Picard fig. 3) depicting hoplites on board a ship, and a helmsman; a more appropriate dedicatee than Phrontis could not be found. Sounion being such a conspicuous landmark in the Saronic Gulf ('would I were where there is a wooded, sealashed 147 See Wachsmuth, nó(iJti(ioç ó Saíficov (n. 133) 156-8. 148 On this cult see J.

Studs. 12 (1979) 1-19, suggests that a small temple north of the temple of Athena and near the pit where the votive plaque was found was dedicated to Phrontis.</page><page sequence="49">42 THE HEROES OF ATTICA promontory, jutting out into the sea, under the high cliff of Sounion, so that we might hail holy Athens'1™) one might expect to find here a sailor well-disposed to mariners, to point the way; in fact the hero at the promontory, most often a sailor in myth and pilot of a more famous hero, is a well-attested phenomenon, though not apparently found elsewhere in Attica.151 The Odyssean lines look as though they refer to a pre-existing cult rather than supplying the inspiration for a later phenomenon: why mention Phrontis and Sounion otherwise? If this is so, the cult may be remarkably old. 'Phrontis Onetorides' looks like a significant name, suggesting concern and help, and the presence of votives also, such as the painted plaque, leads one to suppose that Phrontis performed useful services and could presumably be responsible for the saving of ships. In fact this votive may be our only real evidence for cult paid to a sailing hero in an occasion of specific need - though we can hardly suppose that this was a rare occurrence, as long as the heroes were venerated at all. Paralos: a different case To complete our survey of the known sailing heroes of Attica (there were surely many others) we should perhaps consider the case of Paralos, eponym of the trireme Paralos and owner of a shrine perhaps at Peiraeus. His name proclaims that he is the hero who resides by the sea, and it is possible that originally he too was a helper-hero similar to those considered above. He had enough personality to be considered, not unnaturally, a son of Poseidon.1" But what we know of him shows him in a rather different light from the heroes previously considered. Two fourth-century inscriptions reveal the existence of a group called Paraloi, who sacrifice (ťhkoai) to Paralos and place their decrees in'a Paralion.1" Elsewhere the Paraloi are those on board the Paralos; 1,4 since the trireme was named after the hero, this usage can scarcely be coincidence; we should regard the Paraloi of our inscription as a thiasos or other informal religious grouping of men who had served on board the Paralos. The hero Paralos, for whose worship they came together, functioned as a focus of loyalty and an expression of corporate identity, in a manner with which we shall become familiar. Paralos, regarded in this way, is a more exclusive hero than those sailors who will help anyone, but at the same time his sphere of action is the group rather than the individual. One may speculate that Paralos would help his own, and be invoked by them, in cases of distress and need. It is further possible that since his connexion with the ship was so close, he could usefully be invoked by men while they were actually on board ship. It is perhaps on this score that most other sailing-heroes would have their most marked deficiency. One may take prophylactic measures at the shrines of heroes to prevent shipwreck before sailing, but when a '»ïv* vXôev èneoTi jcóvtov Jtp0ßX.rin' á^iK^uoiov aicpav votò jtXáica louvíou, xáç íepàç ôjtcoç Jtpoo- eijtoiļiev AMvaç, S.

This habit, and the accompanying practice of dedicating votives for delivery, are well enough attested in a divine or semi-divine context; the Dioskouroi in particular are well-known as saviours of ships, and the Homeric Hymn addressed to them (33.6-17) shows that they were thought able to receive sacrifice performed at the moment of crisis. Later, Christian saints could be invoked in much the same way.155 The hero proper, on the other hand - for the Dioskouroi have the mobility of gods - may suffer from the handicap of close or exclusive association with his tomb. For ships sailing around Sounion, Phrontis might seem close enough to be called from the sea nearby, but would he be of much use halfway across the Aegean?156 And what were the chances of the sailor from distant parts knowing the correct local hero to invoke? Travel indeed to some extent breaks down the structure of locality on which the hero largely depends. It is true that sudden apparitions of heroes are a respectable phenomenon, and particularly at moments of crisis heroes can appear or be summoned from their ordinary abodes to give help elsewhere, like Echetlaios at Marathon or Phylakos at Delphi. This occurred at the battle of Salamis, but there the Aiakidai might be considered to have a special interest in defending their own iand, and perhaps to be specially qualified to do this. The sphere of minor heroes is so limited that they were more probably invoked in time of peril only when their tombs or shrines were in close proximity. Within this rather limited area, however, these heroes do seem to perform useful functions. They are important enough to receive annual sacrifices for their continued goodwill. Their origin may perhaps be sought in particular feeling attaching to various harbours, beaches and look-out points along the coastline; this would explain why they are situated at conspicuous, significant points. From the hero who helps sailors to the sailor-hero is a relatively short step, requiring little more development than occurs in the case of the hero-physicians. As with that group, the development may then continue further with the creation of myth and integration into pre-existing saga. The Phaleron group provides an extreme example of this process, in which many factors are at work, but among the attested Attic heroes of this type we can see almost all stages of development. It would seem likely that all were capable of affording protection; but we hear no stories of malicious heroes who bring ships to grief. 155 A satirical description of such a scene, with pilgrimages promised as well as simple dedications, is found in Erasmus' colloquy Naufragi um.

As long as each citizen still retained a vivid consciouness of the city's collective existence - and this is a condition fulfilled almost throughout antiquity, at least in the Greek world - such considerations could never be seriously more remote, less 'real', than the relationship of god or hero to individual. Corporate worship and a roughly common apprehension of the beings worshipped can of course be a powerful force for the cohesion of the community. The chapters which follow will be essentially an extended essay on this proposition, from the point of view both of the polis as a centralised institution and of smaller groups within the polis. But here I wish to discuss the more direct role of the hero in 'saving' and 'benefiting' the community - that is, in a crisis, normally the city as a whole. In essence this type of action is simply the beneficial action of the previous chapter writ large. But there are many more complications, and some important distinctions between heroic and divine action. There are not really many different types of crisis which beset the Greek city. Myth and history alike know of only a few: war and foreign attack, famine and pestilence, occasionally natural disasters. To these we might add faction and civil disturbance, which in myth are generally assimilated in effect to war. War is in fact by far the most usual of these emergencies, although mythologically war and famine are often alternatives. It has even been suggested that a major factor in the rise of hero-cult itself, as of other contemporary religious phenomena, was just such a crisis, a supposed eighth-century drought and famine,2 and if it is really the case that the plague of 428 sparked off a renewed interest in several cults it is not improbable that heroic intervention was actually believed to occur. However, it is war which offers the greatest number of instances of intervention on the part of heroes. The simplest type of phenomenon and perhaps the earliest - of itself it does not even imply any form of cult - is the appearance of the hero fighting on the battlefield.3 This is a form of action which gods also indulge in, though perhaps (outside Homer) less commonly than heroes, and such epiphanies occur very widely in the ancient world. Often it is some figure particularly associated with the city in a general sense who appears, whether god or hero; thus Poseidon, the city's patron, at Mantineia around 240, or the Salaminian archegete Kychreus, in the form of a snake, at the battle of Salamis.4 On other occasions we meet heroes who seem to have a specialised function of this sort; this is strongly suggested by the name of the hero, Phylakos, who saved Delphi both at the time of the Persian wars and during the Celtic invasion of 279.5 But the earliest Attic episode of this type is of a rather different character. The huge figure of a hoplite whose beard shadowed his shield, and who blinded Epizelos son of Kouphagoras and killed the man next to him, was presumably a hero, although Herodotus (6.117) does not use the word. But so far from giving help to the people who saw him, this hero is fighting on the enemy's side. It is perhaps natural enough that the enemy, too, should have its heroes, yet this 1 See A. D.

However, the Marathon fresco of the Stoa Poikile, dating from the mid fifth century, at most fifty years after the battle, already shows a developed mythology of superhuman intervention, and it is one along more conventional lines. Pausanias' description is quite clear (1.15.3). At the battle are present the hero Marathon, Theseus, Athena and Herakles; they are not shown fighting, for clearest among the fighters are Kallimachos, Miltiades and the hero Echetlos or Echetlaios. Their presence therefore may be purely figurative, as the gods and heroes most closely concerned, or may imply involvement without (necessarily) physical presence, as the iconographie convention of a later age shows the Virgin and saints at the battle of Lepanto.7 There is in fact a clear reason for the presence of each of these figures, Athena and Theseus protecting Attica (although each has also specific connexions with the north-east8) and Herakles and Marathon the plain itself. The first two need no comment. Herakles had a very old cult at Marathon, and the Marathonians claimed to have been the first to pay him divine honours.9 Before the battle the army encamped in the local Herakleion, and sacrificed at the Herakleion of Kynosarges on their return to the city. 10 Marathon, or Marathos as he sometimes appears, is an interesting character; according to Plutarch ( Theseus 32), whose source is Dikaiarchos, he was an Arcadian who fought for the Tyndaridai in their invasion of Attica to recover their sister Helen from Theseus. In accordance with an oracle, he allowed himself to be killed in battle to ensure victory. But this story can hardly have been in the mind of the painter, as the hero is depicted in company with Theseus himself. The idea that the eponymous hero of the deme was a warrior who had practised devotio sounds rather like a reflex of the battle, so that he becomes a prototype of the Marathon dead. Evidently the complete tradition was not fixed in the mid fifth century. The sole fighting hero of the fresco, Echetlaios, appears only here, to our knowledge. M. H. Jameson supposes that Echetlaios is the hero of the plough-handle, connected with the farmer's prayer as he grasps the implement before beginning the year's ploughing." Although in one sense this fits in well with the general pattern of heroic intervention in battle, where it is the local hero who appears, it seems unlikely that a comparatively minor Marathonian hero would have appeared to the Athenian army in general, unless they had sacrificed to him beforehand; and this possibility is apparently ruled out by the necessity of a Delphic consultation. Athenian bafflement at this epiphany produced the Delphic response to honour the hero Echetlaios, and this can be seen to conform to a contemporary pattern of the oracle's institution of hero-cults. It was only after the mysterious appearance that Echetlaios was honoured as a hero, although we may agree with Jameson that he appeared in agricultural guise because, though previously unknown, he was recognised as the local hero, and therefore a farmer. Philostratus (VS 27) is probably confusing Echetlaios with the hero Marathon in stating that the latter was depicted in 6Cf. W.

For the painter of the fresco they were distinct. Another tradition is recorded by Plutarch ( Theseus 35); his authority is not clear, but he states that many who fought at Marathon thought they saw Theseus in arms. Despite the fact that this is emphatically not portrayed in the Stoa Poikile depiction, it need not be discounted as a later version, for in 490 Theseus was still at the peak of his popularity. His appearance at the battle would lend extra point to the recovery of the bones from Skyros - by Miltiades' son Cimon. Any heroic apparition without some distinctive feature, such as was found in the case of Echetlaios, could have been identified with Theseus. Herodotus deliberately passes over these more comfortable traditions, implicitly contradicting popular versions and citing instead the eye-witness testimony of a named participant in the battle. Indeed, in the confusion of the fighting several distinct versions of heroic identification could arise. There appears to be a background of a general, vague expectation of heroic help or even hindrance, but not always any expectation that a particular hero would appear. The logical sequel to these half-expectations would be to make deliberate efforts to win the support of certain heroes. If this occurred at Marathon, the obvious choice of hero would have been Herakles, since the army camped at the Herakleion - but we hear nothing of Herakles' appearance, whether because no attempt was made or because the hero failed to respond. At Salamis, on the other hand, the army certainly did invoke local heroes; they called on Ajax and Telamón from the island itself and sent a ship for Telamon's father Aiakos from Aigina, though it is not clear in what form he was supposed to be brought.13 These efforts were not in vain, for during the battle armed men, taken to be the Aiakids, were seen stretching out their hands to protect the Greek ships.14 Subsequently the celebration of the Aianteia on Salamis was closely bound up with that of the victory.15 Here again it is the local heroes who protect their own; we do not hear of the appearance of heroes belonging to the cities of any other participants in the battle. But it is not only before battle that we find the Athenians attempting to win over heroes to further their cause. The first example we know of an attempt to find heroic allies, if it is to be regarded as genuine, occurs in the early sixth century. Plutarch ( Solon 9) relates the incident as part of an 'alternative version', but it would clearly fit into either of his accounts. On consulting the Delphic oracle on the subject of the capture of Salamis, Solon received the following reply: ApxtiyotJÇ x®PaÇ ûDoiaiç líptoaç ÈVOÍKOUÇ ïXaao, toòjç Kotatoię Aoawnàç an&lt;piK&lt;xÄA)jrtei, o'i cpöi|ievoi SépKovxai ëç f|e?uov Súvovxa.

These efforts, along with prayers to the gods, were at least partly inspired by an earthquake immediately before. The Aeginetans claimed that it was the ship sent for the Aiakidai which was first into battle: ib. 83. Earlier, the Aiakidai seem to have been literally sent from Aigina to Thebes (Hdt. 5.81.1), though unsuccessfully as far as the Thebans were concerned. 14 Plut. Them. 15. There were several other apparitions of a more or less heroic kind, but these were more or less spontaneous. A woman appeared to encourage the Greeks to join battle (Hdt. 5.81.1) and a mysterious ship from nowhere, from which the fighters (in the Athenian story) taunted Adeimantos, the fleeing Corinthian general, and prophesied a Greek victory (8.94). A snake was also seen among the ships, which the oracle at Delphi later declared to have been the Salaminian hero Kychreus (Paus. 1.36.1), on whom see n. 38. 15 At least this seems to have been the case for the ephebes; see Deubner 228, quoting IG II ^ 1028.27.</page><page sequence="54">THE HERO AND THE CITY 47 He then secretly sailed to Salamis by night and sacrificed to the heroes Periphemos and Kychreus. The precise measure of historical truth, if any, which lies behind this story is not really important; what matters is the belief implied. This has a very close parallel in less historically based literature, when Euripides warns that the enemy must not be allowed to sacrifice to the daughters of Erechtheus (below). A sixth-century date does not, in fact, seem impossible for such a tradition. If such an event did occur, or was at the time believed to have occurred, it would be most important that the Megarians should know of the sacrifice and be led to believe that the Salaminian heroes now favoured the Athenians. In a case like this, it is hard to judge how much weight to place on the help which the heroes are believed to bestow and how much on the propaganda effect, and perhaps contemporaries would have made little distinction; both pre-suppose a fairly widespread belief that heroes can intervene directly in political and military matters. Things are taken a stage further in the second incident, in which Delphic authority is also an element. The date is approximately a hundred years later, and the oracle, according to Herodotus (5.89), advised Athens to refrain from attacking Aigina for thirty years, and then to build a temenos to the Aiginetan hero Aiakos. The intention is clearly conceived along the same lines as the previous episode; here, however, not only is sacrifice to be organised on some more permanent basis, but also the hero must in some sense be brought to Athens. It is interesting to note that in this conception a hero's physical remains are not indispensable to his presence; this temenos is not the only one which did not contain the hero's tomb, and indeed the whole phenomenon of heroic epiphanies in time of crisis implies that the hero, like other dead, is not firmly confined to his burial place.16 But in this case the actual possession of the bones would no doubt have been still more efficacious. Perhaps attempts were actually made on the remains; at any rate, the Aeginetans' desire to keep secret the fact that Aiakos' altar was also his tomb suggests that they feared such an event. Our source for this information, Pausanias (2.29.8) is usually scrupulous in not revealing àjtópprixa, and the exception here suggests that he may be aware that the reason for secrecy is no longer cogent. Here we are approaching the Roman practice of evocatio, the summoning away of the gods of an enemy city.17 Already in Homer, gods 'leave' the warrior who is about to die, and presumably this idea originates as an explanation of the fighter's death. Once the idea gains acceptance, however, it is logical enough to attempt to induce such an event. But in Greek society, it seems to have been heroes rather than gods who were to be enticed away or removed by force from cities, just as heroes more commonly appeared in battle than gods. The spontaneous help sometimes given by heroes could on occasion be deliberately harnessed, whether it was to defend their own people, as in battle, or to transfer their allegiance to enemies. The latter was clearly a well-known practice which could be sanctioned by Delphi, and this leads us naturally on to the importance of the possession of heroic bones. Here the well-known case is the episode of the Spartan 'recovery' of the bones of Orestes.1" Although there is no exact parallel in Attica to the bringing over of alien bones and the subsequent, or rather consequent, subjection of the territory from which they were taken (the closest thing comparable being the return of the bones of Theseus: below, p. 53), this episode may still throw light on modes of thought which prevailed in Attica as well. The bones of Orestes and the bones of Theseus probably had specific connotations in political propaganda, claims to 16 See Brelich 80-1. 17 Discussed by F.

Heroes could then be persuaded to change their allegiance not merely by receiving sacrifice, but by being physically snatched away; the hero's bones can approach a sort of impersonal talisman. On one level this sort of phenomenon does not differ very much from the sacred object, like the Palladion, which guarantees the city's safety while it remains within. Even in much later times, cities might contest regularly over such talismans: according to Pausanias, the Tithoreans would attempt in spring to steal earth from the tomb of Amphion and Zethos at Thebes and place it on the tomb of Antiope and Phokos in their own land, in order to secure a better harvest than the Thebans, who kept guard over the tomb to prevent this.1'' Yet here there seems to be a mythological reference as well; so were heroic bones magical objects, or did heroes as personal agents lend their support to one city or another? The relative rarity of cult centring on individual bones and fragments of the body, in contrast with much later practice with the relics of saints, might seem to suggest that the hero as complete being was more important, but even so a whole body might be moved without the hero being presumed to give his consent. An example of the dominance of the personal concept may be provided by Euripides' Heracleidae, if indeed (which is far from clear) Eurystheus' speech of prophecy (1040ff,) is to be taken as forbidding only the descendants of Herakles from sacrificing to him; such sacrifice will not mollify him, but he will return evil for good.20 On the other hand in Erechtheus it is the talisman element which is stressed; sacrifice by the enemj ..o the Athenian girls will bring trouble to the Athenians willy-nilly (fr. 65.87-9). Both the 'talisman' and the 'personal' concept figure in Oedipus at Colonus ; though it matters where Oedipus ends his life and hence where his 'grave', if it can be so called, is sited, it matters also that his hatred of the Thebans is implacable both in life and in death. Presumably both concepts were widely influential. We can at any rate affirm that the hero's saving bones represent a common and widespread phenomenon, often sanctioned (at the least post eventum ) by oracles. Arkas at Mantineia, Hesiod at Boeotian Orchomenos, Hector at Thebes: Pausanias is full of diverse examples.21 In Attica, it is clear enough that the bones of Theseus are a part of this tradition, but still more illuminating instances are provided by the graves of two heroes who came to Attica while still alive: Oedipus and Eurystheus. Our sources are mainly dramatic, which presents its own difficulties. Tragedy, with its frequent emphasis on the links between the heroic past and the world of the contemporary audience, seems to have a special fondness for the heroic grave where past and present actions evoke one another. How far the dramatists reflect real traditions and how far they produce free variations on a theme, perhaps even, like the atthidographers, indulging in learned speculation as to the truth, is clearly extremely difficult to determine, and in the end our decision perhaps depends on subjective criteria. The theme of the heroic tomb conferring benefits is used not only by Euripides, who had a liking for the related theme of freiwilliger Opfertod, 22 but also, '"Paus. 9.17.4. 20 The problem lies in the understanding of lines 1040-1, àXXà unte noi xoexç / od|i' éàoeî' (Reiske: ¿ácrr)ç L) eiç èfiòv otáÇai tá&lt;pov (Heath: tójiov D.

O'Connor-Visser, Aspects of human sacrifice in the tragedies of Euripides (Amsterdam 1987).</page><page sequence="56">THE HERO AND THE CITY 49 and more famously, by Sophocles, in his last play Oedipus at Colonus. But let us examine the earlier play first. Euripides is not our only source of knowledge about Eurystheus; there were a number of traditions relating to his grave. Strabo's version is one of the fullest (377); he says that Eurystheus' body was buried in Gargettos, his head by the spring of Makaria in Trikorythos. Gargettos is more or less equivalent to the temple of Athena Pallenis which Euripides gives as the location (Síaç nápoiťte Jtaptìévot» naAArivíôoç, Held. 1031),21 but a completely different tradition is represented in Pausanias and Apollodorus, who speak of a tomb in the Megarid.24 In saga, Eurystheus was an Argive, rival and enemy of Herakles, with no Athenian connexions; in mythological terms, then, his presence outside the Argolid should be explained either by exile or by hostilities. The Gargettos/Pallene area does not, however, immediately make one think of an invasion from Argos, which would be unlikely to proceed via Marathon, marching thence southwards to the city, like Peisistratos' men, and meeting the defending force at the obvious point, just north of Hymettos. Though such a route is not impossible, it seems a much more likely choice for an invader from the north; the tomb in the Megarid is more natural for an Argive invader of Attica. If there was a hero at Paliene, and if he was originally a defeated enemy, his identification with Eurystheus would be secondary; the association could in fact have come about because of the proximity of Herakles' temple.25 Alternatively, it is just possible that there was no hero at all; lines 1040-1 could be taken as an indication: àXXa ļAīļTE noi xoàç ļiTļtf' avļi' éáaa-ť eíç é|iòv aramai Tátpov. But do not allow either libations or blood to drip down (or, do not allow them to drip down libations ...) into my tomb. The purport of these lines depends on whether Eurystheus means that the Herakleidai should not make offerings to him (see above) or proposes a general ban on all offerings; if the latter is the case, Euripides would seem to be explaining to his audience why his 'aetiology' has no correlative in actual cult-practice. Yet Euripides in this case has been remarkably careful to place his 'hero' near a divine temple, in the manner of so many real heroes, and his tradition proved extraordinarily tenacious. Further, he places Eurystheus in what seems to be a genuine tradition of the defeated enemy who exercises a protective function.26 But even if we allow that Eurystheus is a real hero, Euripides is still our only evidence for him as a protector: in the play Eurystheus, about to die, delivers the usual prophecy and aetiology as follows: Kai aoí (xév eôvovç Kai nóXei aconípioç (lÉxoiKoç aiei KEÍaojiai Kata x^óvoç, xoiç tôvSe S' étcyóvoicn. 7toto|ndíraxToç öxav iióXaxn ôeôpo avv 7c0M.fi X£pí- To you I shall be friendly and a bringer of safety to your city when, having changed my home, I lie for ever under the earth; but to these people's descendants I shall be the worst of enemies, when they come to this place with a great army. 23 'In front of the divine maiden Pallenis'.

A notable parallel occurred in historical times in the case of the defeated Onesilos ('benefactor of the people', a significant name) at Amathous, the signs of whose heroisation also appeared at a gate.27 It is a paradoxical pattern, strongly contrasted with the civic hero who continues as his people's protector after death, just as he was in life, and it reminds us of the 'maddened athlete' type of hero, who after terrible deeds is heroised by oracular command.2" In both cases the city is given superhuman help by almost the least likely person; such ambiguity and surprise is not uncommon among heroes. Yet in the case of Eurystheus, as in that of Oedipus, paradox is countered by predictability, for in death as in life Eurystheus remains the enemy of the children of Herakles, and it is specifically Spartan attacks against which he will defend Athens. Eurystheus fits into a pattern, then, but is it tradition or innovation that he does so? Zuntz has shown that the play's story has a particular aptness for the events of 431/0, so it is possible that Eurystheus' particular benevolence is a Euripidean invention.29 On the other hand, Paliene is situated on a major invasion route, and consequently heroes there are particularly well placed to ward off attacks. The important thing is that Euripides consciously or unconsciously recognised a heroic pattern. There are similar methodological problems involved with the figure of Oedipus in Attica. There is much documentation of this subject, but little to confirm Sophocles' version of Oedipus as saving hero at Kolonos; some traditions are incompatible with what the dramatist tells us, while others could have been influenced by the fame of his work. All are agreed that Oedipus was a Theban king, but there are several traditions of his burial place. The credibility of the Attic tradition is not harmed by reports of his burial in Thebes or Eteonos, for such multiple graves are common.10 It is all to the good that Laconia, too, has a cult connected with Oedipus.11 Within Attica, however, we simply cannot have two genuine traditions placing Oedipus at Kolonos and under the Areopagos - these places are far too close to have such independent traditions. Both possibilities are in fact open to objections, although it is hard to believe that Sophocles would have invented the Colonean tradition had the Areopagos grave been very well known. (See Appendix 2.) It is of course still possible that there was indeed a tradition which connected the dead Oedipus with Kolonos, but that Sophocles invented the special features which made the hero important. We can hardly deny that he has made of Oedipus' end a coherent and extremely satisfying dramatic experience, even if it is one peculiarly difficult to analyse. It is necessarily at the risk of some literary insensitivity that we emphasise individual points in the play - but it is fair to assume that Sophocles (like Euripides) was building on ideas which would, in some basic form at least, be familiar to his audience, even if they did not associate them with Oedipus. The presentation of Oedipus as protecting hero, capable despite his unpromising appearance and terrible past of conferring great benefits after his death, is the most fundamental of these, and it is clearly akin to Euripides' Eurystheus: both heroes are foreigners, unlikely heroes for Athens, and furthermore one is an enemy, the other a blind beggar never purified 27 Hdt. 5.1 14. 28 See M.

It is clear, too, that as a hero Oedipus will act for Athens in time to come - the play's future, the audience's present (616-23), when Athenian-Theban relations had indeed become 'bitter'. If we accept the tradition relating Oedipus to Kolonos as pre-Sophoclean, there may be a more specific reference here, as with Eurystheus, although the engagement with the Theban cavalry at the time of Agis' attempt on Athens in 408/7, which is often suggested in this connexion, does not match the details quite accurately.31 But there is of course much more to Sophocles' version that just Oedipus the hero who favours Athens. We should notice the emphasis on the accord of Oedipus' fate - this man once so apparently accursed by the gods - with the whole of the divine system, just as in prosaic actuality heroisation is often confirmed by divine oracle. But the most unusual feature of Sophocles' account is that the location of the grave is to be kept secret. This he associates with the mysterious manner of Oedipus' disappearance. This event seems to be intimately connected with both upper and lower gods (1654-5) and is surrounded with an atmosphere of numinous awe. There is probably more detailed allusion here than we can hope to catch, even perhaps than the original audience could have perceived, but in general terms such things, to Sophocles and perhaps to the average religious consciousness of the age, are ájtóppt|xa simply because extremely holy. The original reason for the grave's secrecy - if indeed Sophocles is reporting a real tradition - was probably a good deal more mundane; to prevent the knowledge of its whereabouts reaching the enemy, who may then, like Solon on Salamis, offer sacrifice there. Such ways of thought could still be recognised in the fifth century, whether or not much credence was given them. While Euripides' Eurystheus perhaps states his refusal to return good for any sacrifices made to him by the children of Herakles (Held. 1040-3), the same author's Athena, in connexion with the Hyakinthides, who are identified with the daughters of Erechtheus, has (Austin fr. 65.87-9): aßaxov Sè xé|ievoç rcaicrì. xaîaS' eivai xpetov eïpTEiv te |j.Tļ xiç JtoX£ļxitov övterp Xaôtov VÍKT1V (lèv aùxoîç, yfì 8è xf|ôe jrrmovīļv. These children's sacred precinct must not be entered, and you must fence it off, lest some enemy sacrifice to them in secret for victory to themselves and trouble to this land. From an aßaxov xéjievoç it is a logical step to a secret one, the whereabouts of which only those authorised may know. We have seen that on Aigina the fact that Aiakos' altar was also his tomb was supposed to be kept secret, and there are even closer parallels for the secret 'grave', if it can be so called, of Oedipus. Eumelos, it seems, told the story of the secret graves of Neleus 32 On the patterns discernible in the Oedipus cult, see also Lowell Edmunds, 'The Cult and the Legend of Oedipus', HSCP 85 (1981) 221-38. His introduction of the idea of autochthony is particularly relevant to the cult of the protecting hero; see below, pp. 1 10-12. 33 Diod. 13.72.3-73.2; on Agis' retreat he camps at Akademeia. Christ-Schmid (Griechische Literatur 1.341) claim that the engagement happened at Kolonos, though this is denied by Jacoby on Androtion 62 (FGrH 324; HIB Supp. 170 n. 9). Better evidence, perhaps, is the oracle preserved at schol.

As not even Oedipus' daughters were to know his tomb, so neither was Nestor allowed by Sisyphos to know that of his father. The secret tomb of Dirke at Thebes presents other parallels, and is even more clearly a state concern; there the outgoing hipparch took his successor to the secret spot by night, where they performed certain rites of which they took care to remove all trace.15 So too Oedipus instructs Theseus to make sure that the secret is passed down to his successors, one to one (1530-2): ÒXK' avx'oq alei atpÇe, x&amp;rav ëç xéXoç XOÛ Çfjv OMplKVTļ, T(p 7tp0&lt;pepxáx([) ļlOVtp cniļiouv', ö 5' aieì xàmióvxi deiKvúxco. But keep |the knowledge) always yourself, and when you reach the end of your life, tell only him you have chosen; let each man hand it on to his successor. - one of the passages most suggestive of a genuine tradition. In this connexion we might mention a sacrifice performed by the polemarchs (who may sacrifice to the heroised war-dead) at Akademeia not far from Kolonos (Heliodorus 1.1 7). 16 If this account is genuine we have a nearby set of saviour-heroes who receive sacrifice from succeeding officials - but not of course a secret grave. It is of course possible that some of these traditions and literary accounts may have influenced each other, but we can scarcely derive the whole idea of the secret grave from Sophocles; it is far easier to suppose that Sophocles is drawing on, no doubt elaborating, a genuine complex of belief. Further, he can hardly have laid such stress on the secrecy of the grave if its location was known to half his audience. Sophocles and Euripides, then, both present us with a acornpioç fípcoç or 'hero-saviour', though how far they were referring to specific beliefs about individual heroes and how far simply improvising on a general tradition cannot precisely be decided. Aeschylus too makes a less specific allusion to the same tradition, perhaps, when he makes the departing Orestes pronounce a curse on any who should dare to contravene the oaths just sworn, in after generations, and conversely promise his own favour to those Argives who favour Athens (Eum. 767-74): aùxoi -yàp f||aeîç ovxeç ëv xá&lt;poiç xóxe xoîç xàná jcapßaivovai vûv ó picconata à|iT|xávoiai npáÇo|!£v SuajcpaÇíatç óôobç àdúiiouç Kai raxpópvidaç nópovç tiôévxeç, ó)ç aùxoîai ļaexaļaeXrļ nóvoç opdouļjevtov 8è Kai rcóXiv xrjç riaXXáôoç xt|iâ)aiv àei xiívôe au|i|iaxą&gt; ôopi aúxoíç àv f||i£íç eīļiev ev)|aevéoxepoi. 14 Paus. 2.2.2. 35 Plut. Mor. 578B. F. Vian, Les origines de Thèbes (Paris 1963) 106, suggests that the Sophoclean ritual is modelled on that of Dirke, and the Theban parallel would clearly have some point. But there are some genuine parallels between Attic and Boeotian cult-forms, and it is also an open question how many Athenians would have been aware of the details of the Theban cult of Dirke. For Christian parallels to the secret grave, see A. J. Festugière, 'Tragédie et tombes sacrées', RHR 174 (1973) 13. 36 Arist. At h. Pol. 58. 1 . Maillon (Héliodore, Budé edition, ad loc.) equates the heroes of Heliodorus with Harmodios and Aristogeiton on the strength of the Aristotle passage, where we are clearly told that the polemarchs sacrifice to this pair (see below, p. 55). But it is plain from Paus. 1.29.15 that they were buried on the road from the Kerameikos to Akademeia, and not at Akademeia itself.</page><page sequence="60">THE HERO AND THE CITY 53 Then I shall be in my grave, but I shall visit inescapable evil on those who transgress the oaths I swear now, giving them unhappy journeys and luckless paths, so that they regret their labour; but, when things go right, to those who honour this city of Pallas with allied shield, rather I would be favourable. The text presents problems, but the burden of Orestes' message is clear: after his death (that is, in the present time) he will be favourable to the allies of Athens and oppose her enemies. At last released from the tyranny of suffering, jtaůeív, he will in death return to the sphere of doing, Ôpâv, and like his erstwhile persecutors will possess both beneficent and maleficent powers of action. The reference to the Argive alliance has long been recognised, but what is interesting for our purposes is that the allusion to contemporary events is linked with the past by means of heroic action. In this instance the particular connexion is very likely to have been Aeschylus' own speculation; what we know of Orestes in Attica from other sources does not suggest a acanípioç fípcoç. All these heroes celebrated in tragedy were non-Attic in origin. Their sphere of action perhaps related specifically to the potential enmities and alliances of their own people with Athens, and the conflicts of loyalty there involved, as well as the linking of mythical past with present, gave such themes a special appeal to tragedy. Certainly we should be far less well informed about these patterns of thought without the evidence of drama. There may, then, have been other heroes of this protective, even talismanic type scattered around Attica of whom we do not hear in detail. Some of them perhaps were more generally protective than the heroes we have been discussing, opposing all the enemies of Attica or of their own locality rather than having a special concern with one other city. Of this type may have been Erysichthon, the hero of Prasiai, whose name is strongly suggestive of such a function; presumably his tomb somewhere on the cliffs or islands around Porto Rafti17 protected the harbour from attack. Kekrops himself, as the tutelary deity of the acropolis, was its protector; he was closely associated with the acropolis snake, and when the snake refused to eat its monthly offerings, Athena was thought to have left the city.-18 The name of the genos which supplied the priest of Kekrops, the Amynandridai, is also suggestive; could Amynandros, the warder-off of men, have been an old name for Kekrops himself? The name of Menedeios at Erchia may also be significant. The episode of the bones of Theseus, brought by Cimon from Skyros around 476, will probably also fit into this scheme. Although we can hardly deny that strategic considerations of a 'secular' character will have played their part in the Skyrian expedition, it seems likely that the Skyrian legend of Theseus is old,19 and hence it becomes more likely that the simple desire to have the bones of Theseus in his own country was a considerable factor in the episode. Not only was Theseus the Athenian hero par excellence, he had also appeared at Marathon, fighting together with Cimon's father Miltiades. From Cimon's own point of view, the return of Theseus could be seen as an attempt to rehabilitate the dead, disgraced Miltiades. But these special considerations do not preclude the possibility of the bones' talismanic value; if Theseus had once, against all odds, saved the Athenians, how much more would he do if he were physically present in Athens itself? 17 éjci npamaîç, Paus. 1 .3 1 .2. ■1# Hdt. 8.41.2-3. The snake (closely connected, of course, with the hero) as protective genius loci may even appear in battle. We have seen that the Salaminian Kychreus appeared in this guise at the battle of Salamis (Paus. 1.36.1); this is no doubt the reason why Plutarch refers to the divine honours of Kychreus as known to everyone (Plut. Thes. 18). In Elis, there is a very close parallel in the appearance of the child-snake Sosipolis and the subsequent victory of the Eleians (Paus. 6.20.2-5; cf. 25.4). These concepts bring us rather closer to the impersonal, lucky talisman than to the hero who fights as a personal agent. 59 See H. Jeanmaire, Couroi et Courètes (Lille 1939) 325.</page><page sequence="61">54 THE HEROES OF ATTICA Another type of protector hero is very probably the hero at the gate, a phenomenon fairly well-attested in several parts of the Greek world.4" No doubt the sacred guardianship of gates has much to do with 'goings out and comings in', with the special quality of boundaries; it cannot be assumed automatically that the reference of gates is to fortifications in general and so to the defence of the city. 'Gates' sometimes occur where there is no evidence of such man- made features; thus Pylochos and his associated heroines at Thorikos might relate to a natural feature, as in Thermopylae, or even to the gates of the underworld.41 However, some of the gate-heroes seem to have a military reference, such as Onesilos, the defeated enemy turned protector, at Amathous in Cyprus (Hdt. 5.1 14). Both concepts no doubt may figure. In Athens the AnaÇomç anļAīi, the grave of the Amazon Antiope, at the Itonian gate, presents a striking parallel to the defeated enemy of historical times; Antiope was presumably among the ranks of those foreign enemies who when defeated change their allegiance.42 The opponents of the Amazons, along with the hero Chalkodon, also had their tombs by a gate, the Piraeus gate; they perhaps continued to protect the city from this point. At the postern on the road from Akademeia was a spring belonging to the hero Panops; he had also a temple and a statue, but we know nothing else about him.41 His name would fit well enough with a protective function. Two historical characters could perhaps be added to the list: Solon and Anthemokritos. The more usual belief seems to have been that Solon's ashes were scattered over Salamis, but Aelian tells us that he was buried at Athens, at a gate 'on the right as you go in' (év 8e¡;ía eiaióvtíov), which looks very much like the place of a protecting-hero.44 Certainly the Salaminian tradition has him maintain Athenian domination of the island." Anthemokritos was in his own person of much less distinction; he was the herald sent to Megara during the build- up to the Peloponnesian War and killed by the Megarians in defiance of accepted convention. Was it supposed that the dead man, like Talthybios, would vent his wrath on the city of his murderers? His burial was decreed by the Dipylon gate, or perhaps the Sacred gate - in either case the direction of Eleusis and Megara.46 Heroic status is also suggested at this date by the erection of a statue. All these figures seem to be related to the oorrrļp; they protect and act for the city as a whole, guarding its boundaries against attack. All these matters of bones, graves, and particular locations relate very largely to specifically heroic qualities. To generalise very broadly, heroes are more local than gods, both in the sense that they are often, though by no means exclusively, thought of as tied to their graves, and also because their importance is more often confined to a single city, which they are thus more likely to favour consistently than a god (whose sympathies may be divided47), especially if, as 40 GGR P 189.

I; and for Athens, Wachsmuth II 226-8. 41 The first possibility is suggested by R. C. T. Parker, 'Festivals of the Attic Demes', in Gifts to the Gods, Boreas 15: Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis, 139 n. 25. 42 Plut. Thes. 27.6, Paus. 1 .2. 1 .

The burial place would parallel Bérard's observation that the heröon at the west gate of Eretria faces hostile Chalkis (Eretria III 69). 47 Obviously some qualifications must be understood here. It is scarcely conceivable, for example, that the Athenians felt much less confidence in Athena's help because of the existence of Athena-cults in Megara or Aegina, and the presentation of offerings to Athena in her Trojan temple did not help Troy (11. 6.297-31 1). A superhuman power may always choose not to heed his worshippers' entreaties.</page><page sequence="62">THE HERO AND THE CITY 55 often, there were myths relating the exploits of the hero for his city while alive.4" This goes a long way to explain their importance in the protection and prospering of the city, and the strength of the tradition can further be seen in the creation of 'civic' heroes in historical times; the dead of Marathon, and the tyrannicides. Aristides, though he may perceive the idea more in terms of sentiment than of literal truth, speaks of the Marathon dead in phrases redolent of the old tradition of the saving hero: they lie 'under the earth protecting the earth itself (vnò yrjv ovxeç TTļv yrļv (puXátxovxeç avnļv). He compares them with Hesiod's 'holy daimons under the earth' (Saínoveç áyvoi vmox^óvioi) and brings Oedipus and Solon, whose ashes in one tradition were scattered over Salamis, into the comparison.49 More sober, though still late, evidence for a cult of the fallen, honoured in state contexts, comes from an inscription of the second century BC and from Pausanias.50 Given the almost legendary quality which the battle very soon acquired (thus the resonance of the word Mapaůcovonáxr) ç later in the fifth century) and the fifth-century cult paid to the dead of Plataea,51 we must assume that the heroic honours conferred on the Marathon dead also date from soon after the battle. The men who in life saved their city from the barbarian would continue in death to be powerful protectors. We have more direct evidence for the early heroisation of Harmodios and Aristogeiton, but their case is slightly different. These two, whose killing of the tyrant's brother was in fact so unhelpful in destroying the tyranny, as fifth-century historians point out,52 were patrons not of Athens in general, but of the Athenian democracy. In the fifth century, Solon had become far enough removed to be a safe uncontroversial figure whom everyone could approve (though he might be all things to all men); he had, after all, distinguished himself against a foreign enemy, while the action of Harmodios and Aristogeiton related only to internal Athenian politics. Despite the fact that statues of the tyrannicides were set up in the agora and sacrifices performed to them (significantly, by the polemarchs),51 they did not have quite the same universal approbation, and the 'Harmodios song' or songs, the other evidence for early heroisation of the pair, always retained a strongly and specifically democratic flavour.54 Civic heroes they certainly were, but if as heroes they engaged after their death in political activity, it would obviously have aimed at protecting the democracy rather than warding off foreigners from the state, however governed.55 For it is clear enough that there is usually a very intimate connexion between the mythology and the function of these protecting heroes. Heroes like Kekrops were leaders and protectors of their people in life; naturally after death they would continue the same function. If after death they retained any powers, they were unlikely to give up their former interests. From one point 48 See below; but here again qualifications are needed, for as we have seen, heroes sometimes defy their lives or mythology and act favourably in the directions where previously they were hostile, such as Onesilos or Kleomedes. Such a change of loyalty may be accompanied by an explanation relating to the hero's lifetimes, as with Eurystheus and Oedipus. 49 See above, n. 45. The text of Hesiod does not correspond to ours; the passage quoted seems like a conflation of the gold and silver races (Op. 141, 122). 50 IG II2 1006.8, 1 1, 26 (122/1 BC); the 7toAA)ávÔpeiov is crowned and a sacrifice performed. Paus. 1.32.4 attests the heroisation of the dead and the tradition of a ghostly nocturnal battle. 51 Thuc. 3.58.4. 52 Hdt. 5.55, 6.123.2, Thuc. 1.20.2, 6.53-9. 53 Arist. Ath. Pol. 58.1.

Bowra, Greek Lyric Poetry (2nd edn., Oxford 1961) 378-9. 55 The only evidence we have is an archaising oracle of the second century after Christ, where the pair advise sacrifice to the hero of the Thriasian plain (IG II2 5007). Avépoç àvTim^oio may refer to Hipparchos; but the oracle is a forgery, probably with no contemporary relevance.</page><page sequence="63">56 THE HEROES OF ATTICA of view, the presence of foreign heroes as protectors of the land is merely an extension of this, although it can also be seen as an example of the often unpredictable and apparently capricious nature of the hero, who is frequently not quite what he seems. But sometimes the logic is more transparent: to see one's protecting heroes as foreigners is to claim that they have left the foreign or enemy city. It is the equivalent on the mythological plane of sacrificing to foreign heroes or carrying away their bones, and it has the same effect; the hero Eurystheus will strenuously oppose the descendants of the Herakleidai and Oedipus those of the Spartoi. An event in the hero's lifetime, followed by changed political circumstances, explains a changed allegiance, so that here too myth and function fit closely together. Some myths mirror a saving function even more closely, those in which the hero or heroine performed one notable act in life to save the city. It was that act which resulted in the deaths and heroisation of such heroes, for we are speaking here of the pervasive myth of the sacrificial death demanded for the country's deliverance. We have already encountered examples of such myths in the figures of Marathos and the Hyakinthides, both of whom, it seems, follow up their death to secure victory with a continuing protective function. Human sacrifice is a common enough event in myth. It may occur in the formal context of sacrifice at an altar, or the sacrificial element may be less obvious; it may be carried through, or it may be just averted. Not all of these myths can be related to the same pattern, and certainly not all of them are relevant to the present discussion. But a frequent motif in such stories, one which links it clearly but paradoxically with scapegoat ritual, is some sort of public crisis, in response to which the sacrifice occurs; the sacrificial victim thus saves the people. This scheme can further be linked with the mythical human sacrifice as aition for some detail of cult-practice; the hero, or more frequently heroine, of the myth could be viewed as a kind of surrogate victim for the worshippers. Hers was the last sacrifice demanded, and by that sacrifice she averted the necessity for any further repetition. As a heroine, however, she might continue to protect the people against such crises as she had died to avert. Sometimes the myth involves no formal sacrifice, but simply a death to procure safety or victory: unum pro multis dabitur caput. Thus Aglauros throws herself off the acropolis, or Kodros voluntarily gives himself to be killed in battle. In Attica these myths divide sharply into two types: the warrior, perhaps a king, who is killed in battle, and the girl or girls who are willingly sacrificed or kill themselves. The first type is perhaps better known in Rome, where devotio was a well-established practice with its own ritual prescriptions, than in Greece. But it is found in Greece also; in historical times, the example of Leonidas springs readily to mind. The relationship between the episode of Thermopylae, with the oracle (surely produced not much afterwards) demanding the king's death for victory and the similar story of Kodros obviously demands explanation. It is possible that the Kodros story was polished up and given a new popularity after Thermopylae, so that the Athenian king becomes a sort of proto- Leonidas, or less neutrally a rival of the Spartans in courage ('an Athenian king did it first') - the enemies of Athens in the story were 'the Dorians'.56 But the tradition was almost certainly known before the Persian Wars, and indeed if the oracle given to Leonidas is to be comprehensible it seems to imply a tradition in which kings die to save their country; the Kodros story may equally well already have been part of this. It adds the further detail that since the oracle becomes known to the enemy, the king must disguise himself as a poor woodcutter in order to get himself killed. In appearance, the city's saviour is a figure of no account, like Oedipus a most unlikely person to bestow atonļpia; appearances are false, of 56 The oracle is usually regarded as post erenltwr, see PW I. 296-7. Busolt ( Griechische Geschichte I2 220.2) suggested that Kodros was entirely modelled after Leonidas, but this idea has not found much favour.</page><page sequence="64">THE HERO AND THE CITY 57 course, and the king, as might be expected, will save his people, but the element of paradox remains in the method of procuring that safety. The death of the king here approaches the death or removal of the scapegoat, the offscourings rejected by society.57 This legend, perhaps even practice, reflects the common 'either-or' motif of a terrible choice, the victory at a high price made so explicit in Aeschylus, Agamemnon 202-5. More frequently, as here and with Erechtheus, it is not the king who dies but the king's daughter or daughters. Clearly this demands some explanation. King's sons in some places may also die sacrificial deaths (Menoikeus and Lophis in Boeotia, for example) but the sacrifice of a virgin girl is far more common. Burkert sees the virgin sacrifice in terms of male aggression and sexuality, but this (presumably) means removing the boys from the scheme entirely.58 A much simpler explanation, and one which better explains the connexion of this pattern with the acorrí pía motif, is just that the efficacy of sacrifice may depend on the value of the victim; thus human sacrifice is so terrible a remedy that even in myth it is performed only in response to the direst emergencies. Youth and virginity is important in a girl as it is not in a boy, for the girl's virginity is a precious possession required by her husband. Yet while she is still a virgin she remains unfulfilled, so that she, rather than the boy, whose virginity is a matter of little concern, is giving up what is due to her in life. Further, since a woman's sexual experience is seen in terms of her being possessed, her virginity is a sort of guarantee that she belongs only to the deity to whom she is sacrificed. We never hear of the sacrifice of a married woman (Alcestis does not belong in the category of public sacrifice), nor indeed of a man past fighting age. Youth in either sex is precious, though it may not always have identical connotations. Yet the sacrificed virgin is not merely a passive victim. Like any sacrificial victim, she must consent to the sacrifice, and this consent makes her an active ccoxeipa. As Euripides' Praxithea implies, the girl gives her life for her city just as the boy gives his in battle (Austin fr. 50.22-5) - more indirectly, perhaps, but more decisively too. As with the beggar-king, deliverance comes from an unlikely source, and this can be compared also with the saving function of the foreigners and enemies. The best-known example of a virgin's sacrificial death in Attica is of course provided by Iphigeneia, aspects of whose cult we have already considered. Essentially her function at Brauron, apart, perhaps, from acting as a sort of kourotrophos figure, is as paradigm of both priestess and arktoi; her sacrificial death is then explicable in terms of the elements of ritual death in the rite performed by the latter. The case, then, is far from simple. The tradition of Iphigeneia as saviour is of course known outside Attica, as is sufficiently shown by the more familiar mythical versions which make her the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, not of Theseus and Helen, and situate her sacrifice at Aulis, not at Brauron. In these versions she is the saviour of Greece - the Greek expedition against Troy - not of Attica. Although her role in relation to women giving birth remained relatively closely defined, the story which made of her a ocoreipa was not echoed by any tradition of Iphigeneia as a present help in trouble, so far as we know. It looks rather as though epic traditions have been tacked onto an originally self- sufficient, aetiological myth which has thus become assimilated to the acoxeipa pattern. This assimilation is not completely arbitrary, for there are many points of contact in the patterns. We have not only the human sacrifice, but also the very close relation between the victim and the goddess in many stories of this type - Aglauros and her sisters with Athena we have noted, 57 See further W. Burkert, Structure and History in Greek Mythology and Ritual (Berkeley 1979) 59-77; R. C. T. Parker, Miasma (Oxford 1983) 258-69; and on scapegoats, J. Bremmer, HSCP 87 (1983) 299-320. 58 Burkert, HN 58-67. I am in greater sympathy with the approach of Nicole Loraux, Tragic VVVn.v of Killing a Woman (Cambridge, Mass. 1987) 31-48.</page><page sequence="65">58 THE HEROES OF ATTICA and we shall come across Androkleia and Alkis in connexion with the Boeotian Artemis Eukleia. Iphigeneia of course stands very close to Artemis, perhaps even originally having been indistinguishable from some aspect of the goddess. If, as seems quite probable, this heroine had also a kourotrophic function, this again links her with the type, for such heroines are very commonly nurses of children, despite their virginal status. In any case, the story of Iphigeneia's death was obviously well enough known for the existence of some sort of consciousness of Iphigeneia as a saviour-figure, even if her saving action was not thought of as operative still in the present. Stories of virgin sacrifice or near sacrifice are not uncommon outside Attica, often attached to more or less historical events such as the second Messenian war or the battle of Leuktra.59 In such traditions we do not hear of individual named heroines receiving cult after their deaths. But within Attica the only other single heroine we know of whose death assured deliverance is Herakles' daughter Makaria. Here again we are faced with literary problems, the earliest and fullest source for the myth being once more Euripides' Heracleidae, according to which the unnamed daughter of Herakles gave herself for sacrifice in accordance with an oracle to assure the defeat of the forces of Eurystheus. There is an obvious parallel - and a political point in the comparison - with the quasi-sacrificial death of Eurystheus as expiatory victim, and his subsequent role as saviour, and both 'traditions' have been suspected of being Euripidean inventions. While the details of Eurystheus' heroisation are emphasised, nothing, so far as we can tell from the possibly mutilated state of the text, is said about what will happen to Makaria after death, yet this could be explained by the tendency of aetiologies to occur towards the end of plays; an earlier reference to contemporary cult would interrupt the flow of the play and the pathos of 'Makaria"s death. More suggestive is the emphasis placed on the sacrifice to 'Demeter's daughter', Aiļļir|Tpo&lt;; KÓpt|, which is repeated so often that it may be more than a figure of speech. It is possible that a heroic cult of Makaria was atttached to some local divine cult of Kore, but we have no concrete information to this effect. There is some evidence, though, for an Attic tradition of Makaria independent of Euripides: Strabo and Pausanias mention a spring Makaria in Trikorythos, and Strabo further tells us that the area was known as 'the head of Eurystheus' (Eùpuaûéox; Ketpataļ, although nothing in the Heracleidae seems to suggest that Eurystheus' head will be buried apart from his body at Gargettos/ Paliene).60 The scholia to Plato give us a cult act, relating in connexion with the story that something (the spring? Makaria's tomb?) was pelted with flowers and garlands, though this may originate simply as a rather perverse explanation of the proverb ßdtM.' éç (laicapíav.61 But there is nothing outside Euripides to suggest that Makaria was a saviour, and even Euripides' version Paus. 4.9.4-9, PW no. 361: Plut. Pelopidas 21-2. 60 Paus. 1.32.6, Strabo 377. Surely also related is Apollod. 2.8.2, stating that Alkmene wrought vengeance on Eurystheus' severed head. As P. Burian suggests ('Euripides' Heracleidae : an interpretation', CPh 72 (1977) I) this tradition is likely to have been Euripides' point of departure for the role of Alkmene in the play. Wilamowitz ( Kleine Schriften I 70) thought the spring Makaria had originally no connexion with the Herakleidai and gained the association through the toponym Evpuaôéfflç KEtpa^rļ, coupled with the influence of Euripides' play (which, however, makes no mention of decapitation); the spring's name then came to be applied to the daughter. Perhaps originally the spring flowed from the severed head of Eurystheus, like the river Lophis in Boeotia (Paus. 9.33.3), or, a closer parallel, the Tre Fontane legend in Rome; here the three springs welled up from the places where St Paul's head bounced after his decapitation. 61 Schol. PI. Hipp. Mai. 293A. It is likely that casting garlands into springs was a known practice in Greece, as it was at the Italian festival of the Fontanalia (Varro, De lingua latina 6.22). &lt;J*óAÀ&lt;x are thrown also at the corpse of the sacrificed Polyxena, E. Hec. 573-4.</page><page sequence="66">THE HERO AND THE CITY 59 does not actually require us to believe that the heroised Makaria continued to be a saviour for Athens: her intent in dying was to save her own kin, not the Athenians.62 Makaria and Iphigeneia then conform to broad outlines of mythical thought, but what of specifically Attic cult and belief, a question of particular importance in matters related to the welfare of the polis? It is when we move on to groups of sisters who are sacrificed that a clearer pattern begins to emerge. The pattern, in outline, is as follows: there are three or more sisters, often daughters of a king, one or more of whom are sacrificed or kill themselves in order to save their country; after death they appear still to act in the same capacity, either directly as oòxeipai, or perhaps as nurses and protectors of the city's potential fighting force. The clearest example of the type is given by the Hyakinthides, identified by Euripides and others with the daughters of Erechtheus. They were also known simply as itapdevoi, maidens. The lexicographers give their number as six: Protogeneia, Pandora, Chthonia, Prokris, Kreousa and Oreithyia.61 Of these the last three can be discounted, being merely daughters of Erechtheus known from other traditions, and only the first two in this version sacrificed themselves. The connexion with Erechtheus is not necessarily original, and the names of the sisters are not fixed, but the number two or three seems likely from a comparison with similar groups. The sacrifice of the girls (their manner of death is uncertain) assured Athens the victory in the Eleusinian war, and Euripides suggests that as heroines they continued to have an interest in this sort of matter (below). The daughters of Kekrops could be regarded in a similar light, for in one tradition it was the sacrifice of Aglauros (alone) which secured the victory in this way; she threw herself off the acropolis, in a variant of the more usual version where this fall was caused by the sisters' disobedience and panic. Aglauros' martial interests are also attested in her cultic and amatory association with Ares, and perpetuated in her role as patroness of the ephebes. The daughters of Leos, Phrasithea or Praxithea (a confusion with the mother of the Hyakinthides seems likely), Theope and Euboule, were also sacrificed for the safety of the city, in the story first found in fourth-century sources.64 They probably originate in a false etymology of the building known as AecoKÓpeiov, becoming modelled on a common story type. We know nothing of the cult, if any, of these sisters, but if we accept Thompson's identification of the Leokoreion65 - which is not without difficulties - it appears that the precinct was formally abaton, being surrounded by a parapet, and that a large quantity of offerings (of a type appropriate to female honorands and to a cult concerned with children) were made at the time of the Peloponnesian war. The date and the type of precinct fit in very well with what Euripides has to say about the cult of the Hyakinthides, and with a special interest in safety and victory. There may have been other groups of heroines of this type, but attempts to identify them are no more than speculation. Outside Attica, however, sacrificed sisters turn up again, though only in Boeotia, so that it would seem that we are dealing with a fairly localised type. There are two certain Boeotian examples. First, the Koronides or daughters of Orion, Metioche and Menippe, probably to be placed in Orchomenos;66 in order to stop a plague they stabbed themselves to death with their 62 The chorus, however, represent her death as Jtpó t' à5eA.&lt;p&lt;òv Kai yãç (622) - clearly the yâ is Attica.

Ovid (Met. 13.685ff.). whose account differs in some other respects, calls the heroines Theban, but this is probably poetic licence for 'Boeotian'; the account in Ant. Lib. mentions a shrine and cult in Orchomenos. In Thebes, the Antipoinides</page><page sequence="67">60 THE HEROES OF ATTICA distaffs as an offering to the x^óvioi ôaínoveç, but these, identified as Persephone and Hades, took pity on the maidens and transferred them to the sky as comets (to warn of future disasters?). This brings them very close to the Hyakinthides, who according to Euripides were translated to the aither, probably as Hyades (fr. 65.71-4 Austin): '|/vX&lt;xì |xev ovv tcûvô' ox&gt; ßeßäa' ['Âi6]ijv roxpa, eiç ô' aìdep' aùtœv nveön' éyò) Maxtoiiaaa, övo|a.a ôè KÀ£ivòv diļao|xai ica[d' 'EAA]áôa 'Yatavúíôaç ßpotoicri KiKA.iļ[aKe]iv úeáç Their souls have not gone to Hades; I have made their spirit dwell in the aither, and I shall make their name famous throughout Greece; mortals will call them goddesses, the Hyakinthides. Like the Attic sisters, the Boeotians may have been nurses of Dionysos (below). Another connecting motif is that they were spared death by the deities to whom they sacrificed themselves, though not in so spectacular a manner as Iphigeneia. This links the group of sisters type with the single virgin sacrifice; there is a similar suggestion of unacceptability, and of the ending of the custom. The second Boeotian example is provided by the daughters of Antipoinos in Thebes, again two in number, Androkleia and Alkis, whose heroön was within the precinct of Artemis Eukleia (Paus. 9. 17. 1 ). Here the sacrifice was to obtain victory, and the victim should have been the father, as the most illustrious citizen, but the daughters agreed to die instead of him. But from his name Antipoinos can exist nowhere but in this story, which as it relates to him may be a late romantic fabrication. The two daughters, from their names, stand in a very close relation to the goddess, like Aglauros and Pandrosos in Athens. The names suggest a warlike sphere of action, like that of the goddess, but there is no other suggestion of a continuing function as ocbteipai either for this pair or for the Koronides. In discussing this type Schachter compares also the nameless daughters of Skedasos at Leuktra, who in the only version we know killed themselves when raped, but who may have an alternative story also.67 Since we hear (though with what plausibility may be disputed) of a mooted virgin sacrifice to them as late as the famous battle, it is quite likely that they had some interest in aomipia, although it is odd that their own sacrifice, if such a story did exist, should be thus repeated with themselves as recipients.68 Schachter mentions also, with some doubt, Henioche and Pyrrha, the daughters of Kreon at Thebes, about whom no story is known. Yet outside Attica and Boeotia, although sacrifices of single virgins are known, there is no undisputed example of the sacrifice of a group of sisters.69 The Boeotian examples have two sisters, the Attic usually three, but it seems clear that we are dealing with a common, geographically limited myth type. We have seen that at least some of these groups are comparable in function as well as in myth. The Hyakinthides, especially, will give military assistance to those who sacrifice to them performed a very similar function; they may indeed have been partly modelled on the Koronides, since they gave their lives for victory against Orchomenos. 67 Plut. Pelopidas 21; A. Schachter, Teiresias supp. 1(1972) 19-20. 68 Compare the scepticism of A. Henrichs ( Entretiens Hardt XXVII, Le sacrifice dans l'antiquité (1980) 208-24) on the supposed human sacrifice after Salamis (Plut. Arist. 9.2, Them. 13.2-5). A possible (rather doubtful) parallel for human sacrifice performed to one thus sacrificed herself exists in the sacrifice said to be made to Aglauros at Cyprian Salamis (Porph. de abst. 2.54), if indeed this heroine is related to her Athenian homonym. 69 Although a related group may be the Alkyonides or Halkyonides, who like Aglauros and (sometimes) the Hyakinthides threw themselves off a high place to their death. The only reason given for this, however, in our surviving sources (see Philochorus FGrH 328 F 186), is the death of their father. The location of these heroines is uncertain, but they may be connected with the ÁXiaxoviç ůáXaoaa which forms part of the Corinthian gulf (Strabo 336).</page><page sequence="68">THE HERO AND THE CITY 61 (fr. 65.87-9) and such sacrifices were perhaps normal before setting out to war (ib. 81-3, where the text is more mutilated). No doubt the details of the various cults would reveal further common patterns, but here again the evidence is incomplete. It appears, however, that the youth of the heroines was often mirrored in the participation in these cults of children and youths of either sex. Although the daughters of Kekrops have parts in several different festivals, it is clear enough that the arrephoroi, who were very young, pre-pubertal girls, were in some sense performing the acts of the heroines themselves, while Aglauros at least was also connected with rather older boys. The worship of the Hyakinthides also involved jcapůevoi (again, we may suppose, living representatives of the dead maidens), probably in dances {Erechtheus fr. 65.80). If Thompson's identification of the Leokoreion (above) is correct, the daughters of Leos were offered knucklebones and other children's toys. In Boeotia, we find that the Koronides were the recipients of annual lieiXí-ynaxa brought by boys and girls, and if we can believe in the virgin sacrifice story, young girls might also play a part in the cult of the daughters of Skedasos! It is an attractive idea, though unprovable, that like Aglauros, Androkleia and Alkis were protectors of young soldiers. One common factor, then, apart from the emphasis on the protection of the city, seems to be the prominent role of children and young people in these cults. What is the significance of this? Although many rites involving children, such as the Arrephoria, can be explained as survivals of ancient initiation-forms, this explanation may not cover all our cases. The dancing of maidens for the Hyakinthides and the bringing of offerings to the Koronides are not in themselves the sort of actions to be explained in terms of initiation. And in the latter two cases, the heroines are the direct recipients of cults, not the first performers of the ritual like the daughters of Kekrops. One explanation may be simply that the participants are young because the heroines were young - as gods more usually have priests of their own sex. But the parallel between myth and cult goes further, for several of these sisters are involved in childcare in myth. The more familiar myth of the daughters of Kekrops makes them the guardians of the infant Erichthonios; thus like so many functionally kourotrophic figures they are nurses of a divine or semi-divine child. The Hyakinthides may be parallel in this respect also. Euripides in the Erechtheus clearly identifies them with the Hyades, and it seems from the indirect evidence of Philochorus (who connects the daughters of Erechtheus with Dionysos) that he was not innovating in so doing.™ For the Hyades, according to Pherecydes, are the nurses of Dionysos (who has the epithet "Yr|ç according to Kleidemos),71 and so we would have another group of sisters who are nurses of a divine child. The name Hyakinthides is also indicative; these Attic maidens are certainly not the daughters of the Laconian Hyakinthos, despite the mythographers,72 but though the name is not a patronymic it should be indicative of some connexion. Hyakinthos at Amyklai is a young god, probably a type of the divine child; at Knidos we find Artemis 'Iaicuvdoxpótpoç, and both Otto and Mellink have pointed out the 70 Philochorus FGrH 328 F 1 2 tells us that vrļ&lt;p0A.iai ôvoíai were performed Aiovuocp xe Kai taîç 'Epexôéíoç ťhjyaxpáoi. Since there is no evidence for any cult of Erechtheus' daughters other than as the Hyakinthides, and moreover Euripides would hardly have identified the two had there been two separate cults, we must assume that Philochorus means the Hyakinthides; and Euripides too states that the sacrifice is vr|&lt;póA.iov (fr. 65. 84-6). It can hardly be the case, however, that all sacrifices performed to Dionysos are vrļcpa^ia. so Philochorus is presumably referring to a common sacrifice to Dionysos and the daughters of Erechtheus. But the festival must remain uncertain. 71 Pherecydes FGrH 3 F 90; Kleidemos FGrH 323 F 27. 72 Apollod. 3.15.8, Hyg .fab. 238; cf. Steph. Byz. s.v. Aouoiá.</page><page sequence="69">62 THE HEROES OF ATTICA connexions between the Laconian Hyakinthia and the Tithenidia, undoubtedly a festival concerning children.71 The third indication involves the Koronides - like the Hyakinthides apparently named patronymically, but in the developed myth having a father with quite a different name. In neither case, one suspects, is the name a true patronymic, but refers to some quality shared by the sisters. The name Koronis is persistent as one of the nurses of Dionysos: Diodorus gives the names of the Naxian nymphs who cared for the child as Koronis, Philia and Kleide, while Koronis is a Hyad already in Hesiod.74 Whatever the precise significance of the name, it seems quite likely that the Koronides were also originally nurses of Dionysos, like them a Theban. Hyakinthides and Koronides may then be respectively the Athenian and Theban nurses of the child Dionysos. In cult the sisters are served especially by children, and in myth they protect children, though children of a rather special kind. It seems likely that their protective function extended to the contemporary world of the worshipper, and that this is one of the main purposes of the participation of the young in the related rites. We may have to reject Ervin's equation of the Hyakinthides with the Geraistian nymphs,75 which would give us a clear indication, but the names Protogeneia and Pandora for the two daughters who killed themselves are strongly suggestive of deities presiding over birth and fertility. But what has this to do with their role as saviours of the city? Can it be merely coincidence that there are traces of both functions in all these different groups? We have already viewed the heroines presiding over the care of children as it affects the individual, but there is a public aspect, also, to the matter. Children ensure the city's continuance; they are its future, who will (at least in the case of male children) protect it in war and adversity. They are born not only for their parents and kin groups, but for the city as a whole. This is an idea most familiar to us in its extreme form as expressed in the Spartan system, where young Spartiates are taken away from their parents at a very early age and given over to the service of the state - but it is nonetheless important, surely, in every Greek polis. The death of the Hyakinthides is to be seen in just such terms, in the conception of Euripides' Praxithea (fr. 50.15-16 Austin): ereeixa xéicva xoûô' ëicaxi xíkxo|j.£v óoç ťteů&gt;v xe Ptonoùç naxpíÔa xe (Svwójieùa. Secondly, it is for this that we bear children, to protect the altars of the gods, and our country. Children are necessary to the well-being of the city; the birth of children is as essential as the growth of crops, and failures in these two areas are commonly spoken of together.76 To the Greek mind, the two areas of the sister-heroines' concern, survival in critical times (especially victory in war) and the birth of children are intimately and naturally connected. The two functions of such heroines are really aspects of the same thing. We see this most clearly, 7-' W. Otto, Dionysos. Mythos und Kultus (Frankfurt 1969) 190; M. Mellink, Hyakinthos (Utrecht 1943) 53; cf. also GGR I3 317 and Mellink ch. 2 passim. 74 Hesiod fr. 291 M-W; cf. Hyg. Astr. 2.21. 75 Both Mellink (59-64) and Ervin (IlXaxiOV 21 (1959) 146-59) point out that the Hyakinthides met their sacrificial death at the tomb of Geraistos the Cyclops, and on this basis Ervin (149-50) identifies them with the T epoaaxod vú|a&lt;pai TevéôXiat of IG II' 4547. Nymphs, however, are confined to a particular locality; this will only work if we are prepared to locate the sanctuary of the Hyakinthides at Phaleron where the inscription was found, and a priori a position within the city seem much more likely. Ntiļicpai yEpaiOXiáSeç cared for the infant Zeus at Gortys in Crete, perhaps also in Arcadia (Etym. M. s.v.), and the place-name is found in Euboea, so it is possible, though not perhaps likely, that Attica had more than one set of Geraistian nymphs. 76 Most obviously, S. OT 25-7; see Jebb ad loc.</page><page sequence="70">THE HERO AND THE CITY 63 perhaps, in the case of Aglauros; as patroness of the ephebes she certainly protects the young, but she protects them in their capacity as a fighting force and provides them with a model of patriotic self-sacrifice. In other cases the different functions have become further separated; at first glance there is no very obvious connexion between the Hyades/Hyakinthides as nurses of the child Dionysos and as protectors of Attic soil. We may assume that they were nurses not only in myth, but also watched over human, contemporary children. Such a function merges into the individual's private concerns, but remains linked with the polis through the polis- oriented myths of the heroines. The daughters of Leos are used as a patriotic exemplum for the men of Leontis by the author of a fourth-century funeral speech.77 Euripides, we have seen, had a liking for the theme. No doubt such stories were in the forefront of popular consciousness; we need hardly refer specifically to Greek society to illustrate the power of the patriotic myth to illustrate thoughts and actions. Perhaps the immediacy of such myths helped to retain a concept of the hero as saviour. The Hyakinthides clearly keep after death their ability to bestow victory (Austin fr. 65.87-9). Heroes and heroines, so closely linked to a particular locality, will naturally act as its protectors, extending human activity to a superhuman plane. Kekrops or Theseus, having once helped Athens as kings, now take their places close to the gods of the city, the «oXioûxoi ťteoí, and continue their benevolence to the city - always supposing that the city fulfils its obligations. The foreigner, disillusioned with his own city or acknowledging his defeat, protects the city of his adoption. By a further extension, the heroine who once valued her city more than her life could be expected to continue to place a high value on its safety. The functions of all such heroes extend over past and present. 77 [Dem.] 60.29.</page><page sequence="71">4: THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP: GENE AND ORGEONES The hero's relations with the smaller groups which make up the city are not marked by dramatic interventions, sudden rescues and epiphanies at critical moments. Within the city, deme does not fight against deme, tribe against tribe, nor (except in legal battles) genos against genos. There can be little sudden and dramatic danger besetting such groups which does not affect the rest of the polis-community. Consequently in dealing with such groups and their heroes we must look to different concerns from those which dominate the city as a whole. Groups based on kinship and on restricted localities offer no saviour-heroes, except insofar as their patron heroes may act for the benefit of the whole city. So what functions might the hero fulfil for the smaller group? He might of course still protect the group's interests. Members of the group might address their prayers to him, either for the group as a whole or for themselves and their families as individuals, although here we should not necessarily expect to find much direct evidence. Another possibility, by no means incompatible with this, is that the hero in such cases acted as a sort of focus of loyalty - a necessarily attenuated form of expression for something which could, conceivably, have gone quite deep. Most gatherings of Greeks, for whatever purpose, would include a sacrifice or some form of communal religious act (such as a series of libations at a symposium or dinner- party); habitual common sacrifices were an effective bond, or at least a rallying-cry of some force.1 Even independently of such sacrifices, on the level of myth the hero could also, perhaps, be a focal point, expressing in a basic form the qualities most important to the group and those which dominated its common self-awareness. Of course it is unlikely that all cases will conform to the same pattern; such intangible relations as those under discussion are rarely reducible to a formula. In particular, the many sub-groups in the city are only partially comparable, representing in several respects different types of structure and different ways of dividing the polis. The origins of the genē, of the phratries, and of the groups whose members are known as ôpyEÔveç is obscure, but they appear to have evolved in some sense 'naturally' and are certainly already in existence in some form by the archaic period. What precisely these groups were, how they worked and what place they occupied in Attic society, however, is very far from agreed. It is rather easier to get a generalised picture of the Cleisthenic divisions which from 508/7 cut across these older sub- groups and created new, though not necessarily conflicting, loyalties; but even here there is disagreement. However, if all these groups divide the community along different lines, then such heroes as they might worship - for their cults will not necessarily include those of heroes - are likely also to fulfil diverse functions. We should remember too that part of the difficulty in defining the precise nature of the pre-Cleisthenic groups may lie in actual disparities in different cases. The word "yévoç, for example, may not always denote precisely comparable groups. This further confusion suggests that even among groups formally of the same type there may be important differences in the significance of their hero-cults. 1 Groups such as amphictionies and associations of smaller townships habitually constituted themselves around common sacrifices, whether held at a special common sanctuary or in a holy place belonging to one of the members. In IG IV 679 (late third/early second century) the people of Asine are allowed to participate in the festival of Demeter Chthonia at Hermione oncoç qxxvepà fi 8ióti tav te ovy yéveiav Kaì «pilíav ô[é]Xa òri 7iÀ£iov jtpoáyEiv. See further Burkert, GR V.3.3. 64</page><page sequence="72">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, I 65 1. The eponymous heroes of the genē We shall begin with the older groups, and of them take first the genē, which although controversial at least present a relatively large body of evidence. The Attic genē were groups based in some manner on kinship, and forming in some sense subdivisions of the community; that much is agreed. But there are widely differing pictures of these institutions. The older view is that of a large, often politically powerful group, bound together by ties of kinship now usually held to be fictitious, and claiming descent from a common ancestor who is worshipped as a hero.2 But more recently this picture has been subjected to a radical attack by F. Bourriot, who by a rigorous examination of the use of the word genos has shown that before the fourth century it corresponds far more closely to our 'family' than to 'clan'.1 In particular, it is used of family groups extending over four generations. It is clear that if this view, confirmed from a rather different perspective by D. Roussel,4 is adopted, it will have serious consequences for our picture of the heroes worshipped by these groups; the whole approach of Toepffer, neatly connecting large and more or less stable genē to eponymous ancestors, will have to be modified.5 The place of the genos-hero may be less easily defined. Even in early times, it seems that the word genos might cover groups of different kinds, and the word was much less of a technical term than it is for modern historians. But some lines are clear: Bourriot rightly allows as classical the quasi-technical use of the word for a priestly family like the Kerykes,6 and as we shall see these priestly functions are often of crucial importance in the development of the genos hero. He allows also the genos ás local group, conjecturing that the much discussed word ó|ióyaXaiaeç may have been the old name for such a group.7 The extension of the word to cover groups like the Alkmaionidai on the one hand and the Salaminioi on the other was a later, fourth-century development, reflecting social changes and perhaps greater self awareness on the part of these groups, stimulated in part by the increasing interest in various aspects of local history in this period.8 There is, I think, some overlap between Bourriot's two original categories and two types of development producing a genos-hero; many 'sacerdotal' families possess heroes who mirror their priestly functions, while the 'local group' type of genos tends to have an archegete who expresses locality rather more than cult. A detailed examination will show, however, that these divisions are far from absolute: what does seem clear is that the genos-hero is often a much more shadowy figure than the earlier view allowed. The approach through the hero to the problem of the genos has been considered by Bourriot himself; for his argument that elaborate and complex ties of descent were no part of the structure of the early genos, he would like to minimise or eliminate 2 So the standard works of reference, as T. Cadoux in the Oxford Classical Dictionary, 2nd edn., 461-2. 1 F. Bourriot, Recherches sur la nature du genos (Lille 1976). 4 D. Roussel, Tribu et cité (Paris 1976) 89. 5 J.

Self- awareness: the two writers whose works on genē we know of, Meliton and Drakon. belong to a much later period, hellenistic or Roman, but the wide interests of the atthidographers clearly included such subjects. A fifth-century interest seems to be shown in Euripides' Hypsipyle , which probably concluded with a reference to the Euneidai as Euneos' descendants (Bond, Euripides: Hypsipyle , 20). It would be interesting to know whether any prominent Athenians at the time were Euneids, especially given the coincidence of Cratinus' Euneidai. But Euripides' Erechtheus could similarly be taken as celebrating a genos: if the cults of the Eteoboutadai are perhaps more central to the polis, the Euneids' god Dionysos is still relevant to a dramatic context.</page><page sequence="73">66 THE HEROES OF ATTICA altogether the cult of a heroic archegete. This argument cannot be sustained in its entirety, as there is good evidence for a number of cults of genos eponyms. But the old picture of a genos worshipping its heroic (supposed) ancestor may still be vulnerable, since another possibility is that the cult of the hero did not have much to do with ancestry. There may well be other, more important strands in the relationship of hero to genos. It is usually assumed that the gennetai at every period claimed descent from the archegete, that such was indeed his raison d'être. The patronymic endings of many (not all) genē would seem to confirm this, and it is well known that Socrates traced his descent to Daidalos and Andócides to Odysseus.9 But strict ties of descent cannot always have been of primary importance; there are often logical difficulties. Genē are not always named after their first human ancestor. The Lykomidai claimed a connexion with Lykos son of Pandion, but did not therefore name themselves Pandionidai. The Eumolpidai claimed that Keryx, archegete of the Kerykes, was a son of their own Eumolpos, which should have meant a merging of the two families.1" From another angle, the mythological tradition in some cases weakens the force of the descent theory. Erysichthon, for instance, died young and presumably childless, and yet we hear of a genos Erysichthonidai. The cult of his father Kekrops, on the other hand, was managed by the Amynandridai, yet Kekrops had no son but Erysichthon. Similar is the case of the Charidai, wno were connected with the cult of Kranaos at Lamptrai; the majority tradition makes Kranaos, like so many of the kings, die childless, while a variant gives him Eleusinian connexions, which do not seem to be relevant here. These last two examples show that the chief hero worshipped need not be eponymous, so in these cases there is not even an apparent claim of descent. The Amynandrai should be descended from an Amynandros; the Charidai should perhaps be read as Chariadai, like Pindar's Aeginetan family (Nem. 8.46), and given an eponym Charias. But no such archegetes appear in the tradition. Should we then suppose that in these cases families which had already acquired names somehow came to preside over the cult of an unrelated hero? Charias and Amynandros are both in fact attested as names of men, though this does not preclude their use as heroic names." Similar may be the case of the Praxiergidai, the priestly family in charge of the Plynteria and Kallynteria: no hero Praxiergos is known, but a Praxiergos was archon in 47 1/0. 12 The Lykomidai were certainly not named for Lykos, which could not explain the form in -m-. Lykomedes would be a likely eponym, and we find that the name Lykomedes appears to run in the genos.11 Such families seem to owe their name to some real ancestor who, so far as we can tell, received no heroic honours. Others are apparently named from places: Salaminioi, Mesogeioi, Kephisieis. They, or some among them, may worship a particular hero, as the Salaminioi worshipped Eurysakes; but the cult of Eurysakes was, though in a sense special, only one of many observed by the genos or its l) Socrates: Plato, Alcibíades 1 121 A, and note the whole argument. Andócides: Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 24. 10 A. Andrewes in his important article 'Philochoros on Phratries', JHS 81 (1961) 1-15, points out (8 n. 28) similar difficulties concerning the Spartan tribes. 11 Amynandros a real name: PA 734-6. Another possibility is that Amynandros - 'warder off of men' - though nowhere attested as such, was an epithet of Kekrops, as king and defender of city and acropolis. His half-snake nature would lend support to this theory; the acropolis snake was closely connected with the city's safety (Hdt. 8.41 ) and the Eleian Sosipolis was a child-snake which had given victory in battle. See above, p. S3. 12 Diodorus 1 1 .54. However, Praxiergos would be quite a suitable name for a hero connected with this family - the 'doer of the deed' at the ill-omened Plynteria, which is better not mentioned. Such an explanation, of course, does not necessitate a hero. AuKO(ir|8í6ai &gt; AuKOļiiSai was suggested by Bossler, De gentihus et familiis Atticae sacerdotalibus (Diss. Darmstadii 1833) 41, giving as parallel ©pacru(iíôr|ç, patronymic from 0pacru(ir|6r|ç (Etym. M. s.v. Áxpeíôriç). A Lykomedes of Phlya is known for the early fifth century (Davies AP F no. 9238 pp. 316-7); he made a dedication to Apollo Daphnephoros at Phlya, the sanctuary associated with the family, probably after Artemision (Plut. Them. 15).</page><page sequence="74">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, I 67 officials, and the factor of common identity which was expressed in their name was local and toponymie. So these cases should put us on our guard against too easy a belief that descent was the salient factor, even in genē where no difficulty is apparent. The (Eteo)boutadai may not have been originally simply those claiming descent from from Boutes. The idea of descent may have come into being gradually, well after the original connexion between hero and genos had been established - in those cases where descent is important at all. But what then was the original connexion? The later example of the Cleisthenic eponymoi, whose introduction is a success story, shows that it is quite possible for even an artificially constituted group to feel a special connexion with a hero without any actual claim of descent. The hero could simply be the patron of the genos, having its interests at heart, while they in turn perform the requisite sacrifices to him - very roughly analogous to the later patron saint, whether of individual or of corporate organisation. This will explain the situation in several of the genē but in others we do not find a relationship definite even to this degree. It is not of course entirely safe to argue from cases where there is simply no evidence of a cult, but even so, in a case like that of Krokon, where Pausanias specifically reports that he was unable to find the hero's grave, the absence may be thought significant. The Eleusinian cults, in fact, furnish some interesting information in this connexion; the lawsuit between the Krokonidai and the Ko(i)ronidai is particularly instructive. Neither the speech of Lycurgus nor that of Dinarchus opposing him is extant, but we can still glean quite a lot from the fragments, and from casual references to these genē in other writers.14 It is plain that the issue in question was the allocation of priestly functions, and that many of the arguments used on either side were mythological, going back to the archegetes of each family. They should probably be reconstructed (in part) as follows: the Krokonidai claimed that Krokon was the legitimate, Koiron the bastard son of Triptolemos, thus putting themselves close to the centre of the Eleusinian nexus of cult and clearly having precedence over their rivals. The Koironidai, on the other hand, may perhaps have preferred to be known as Koronidai, thus connecting themselves with the Dionysiac KopcovíÔeç Kópai15 and urging their celebration of the relateu Theoinia in support of this. However, some at least of them16 claimed that Krokon was not Triptolemos' son at all, but the husband of his sister Saisara. The evidence, admittedly scanty, does not suggest that either genos could produce a cult of an eponymous ancestor to strengthen their case, and what is more, it is obvious that if the above reconstruction is correct, the Ko(i)ronidai would not want to. Their own view of themselves depends on the non-existence of a cult of the hero Koiron, and there is no reason for us to assume that this would be felt as paradoxical. The cult of nymphs, even specific named nymphs, can hardly be in the same 14 Thè most recent study, with a bibliography, is that of N. Conomis, Klio 39 ( 1 96 1 ) 1 20-5. 15 This is suggested by the connexion implied in the line of tragedy uà tàç ©eoívov Kai KopcovíSaç KÓpaç (TGrF 1.208 F I ). The situation has recently been complicated by the appearance, probably from late hellenistic times, of a genos Theoinidai (Vanderpool, AJP 100 (1979) 213-6), known previously only from Photius s.v. ©eoivtov (a piece of evidence which in view of the clear connexion of the Koironidai and/or Krokonidai with the Theoinia, attested in Lycurgus fr. 32 Blass/Conomis, had been regarded as hopelessly confused). The genos appears honouring a priestess Tf1ç vuļitpīļĢ: Vanderpool takes this to be the Nymphe on the Acropolis (Travlos 361-4), but this is perhaps over-confident, as vuļicpiļ need be no more specific than fļptūivr). She might equally well be something to do with the KopcovíÔeç KÓpai. As for the form of the name Theoinidai. it is unique among Athenian gene, none of which is named from a god, a divine epithet or a festival. Is it possible that Theoinidai was a new name assumed by the Koironidai after the fracas of the diadikasia, in order to make their cultic affiliations and claims still clearer? 16 Pausanias (1.38.2) is probably using the speech of Lycurgus for the Koironidai as his source (a reference to the deme Skambonidai occurs in the speech - fr. 55 Blass/Conomis, Harpocration s.v.), and the tradition is traced to 'men of Skambonidai', perhaps then a branch of a large genos like the Salaminioi. The story is clearly designed to demote Krokon.</page><page sequence="75">68 THE HEROES OF ATTICA category as that of a heroic ancestor, however real the connexion between worshippers and worshipped. As for Krokon, the Krokonidai claimed he was a son of Triptolemos, and therefore grandson of Keleos; yet the latter, in the Nikomachos calendar, receives a sacrifice from the Eumolpidai!" We are then on shaky ground if we wish to assert that all genē had as a matter of course a particular hero, an archegetes in whatever sense, to whom they paid cult. There are differences among genē. Koiron and Krokon appear to be no more than speculations on the part of the genos' amateur historians; but others - Boutes, Hesychos, Phytalos, Erysichthon and Eumolpos - were clearly real heroes and recipients of cult, almost certainly administered by members of the relevant genos. Boutes has an altar attested in the Erechtheion, in company with Poseidon Erechtheus and Hephaistos. Hesychos and Eumolpos are both given sacrifice by the appropriate genē while the last three all have known tombs.111 Arguments against this position do not appear to be well founded, and there are almost certainly other cases too of the cult of an archegete. But this does not tell us whether the genos came into being around the cult, or whether, as our earlier, negative examples might tend to suggest, the cult is something secondary. We have seen that many of those groups counted as genē maintain charge of a particular priestly function, and indeed the gentilician priesthood is almost certainly the oldest and perhaps the most widespread form of sacerdotal structure in Attica. The Bouzygai preside over a ceremony of sacred ploughing associated with Zeus Teleios, also known as ¿ni naAÀaôíq). The Lykomidai supervise the mysteries of Phlya, and the Eumolpidai, Kerykes, Philleidai, Krokonidai and Koironidai have their several functions at those of Eleusis. The Eteoboutadai, though they may in some ways represent a slightly different phenomenon,20 have charge of most of the cults of the Erechtheion, centring on Athena Polias and Poseidon Erechtheus, whose priestess and priest they supply. Other more or less certain examples are provided by the Semachidai, Hesychidai, Eudanemoi, Euneidai, Phytalidai, Salaminioi, Gephyraioi, Poimenidai, Praxiergidai, Phoinikes and Mesogeioi (see table). In these cases, the eponymous hero very often appears as institutor of the rite or first priest of the god. Boutes received the priesthood when his brother Erechtheus received the temporal power. Bouzyges was the Athenian Triptolemos, the first to plough with oxen; in conformity with the pattern of the culture-hero, he was no doubt given divine instruction. Lykos certainly brought rites from Phlya to Andania in Messenia, though it is an open question whether he or Phlyos, son of Ge, was regarded as founder of the Attic mysteries; one might compare, however, the diversity of Eleusinian traditions on the foundation.21 All this is perfectly in line with a very widespread cultic-mythic phenomenon in which a hero or heroine is worshipped in conjunction with a god, 17 LSS no. 10, 65. ■* Boutes: Paus. 1.26.5. Hesychos: Polemon fr. X Preller. Eumolpos: LSS 10.65. Phytalos: Paus. 1.37.2. Erysichthon: ib. 31.2. Tomb of Eumolpos: ib. 38.2. ,l&gt; Bourriot's objection (1083) that the sacrifice attested to Eumolpos is not genuine hero-cult because not at the hero's tomb is not really cogent; cult of a hero believed to be situated elsewhere is a respectably old phenomenon (Aiakos at Athens, Hdt. 5.89.2). His claim (1081) that ļnvfļ^a in Pausanias suggests an ordinary tomb rather than a heroön can be disproved by the author's practice: thus 8.14.9-10: è'ati ôè ércì XóípOD ^vfļļia 'IípiKÀEODÇ . . . 'I(|HKÀ£Î [lèv òri Kai éç xóôe è'xi évayí^oucTiv eòe fļpcoi. 20 The problem with seeing the Eteoboutadai as a typical priestly genos is that they are demonstrably much larger than the norm: size, and the existence of at least two 'branches', force a comparison with the Salaminioi and suggest a genos of the local group type. See Bourriot 1321-47 (note especially 1337-41, his arguments against Davies, APF 348-9). But both Eteoboutadai and Salaminioi, of course, still have charge of public cults. 21 Boutes: Apollod. 3.15.1. Bouzyges: Etym. M. s.v. BoD^oyia. Lykos: Paus. 4.1.8.</page><page sequence="76">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP. I 69 while an aetiological myth explains that he or she was the first to perform the rite." But we can go further than this, since in several cases it is clear that this is the sole origin of the hero: he is as it were the projection onto the heroic plane of a sacral function, the archetype of the priest. It was the function of members of the Krokonidai to tie a loop of wool around the right wrist and left ankle of the mystes preparatory to initiation, an action known as KpoKoûv (KpÓKtoaiç); we may assume that the hero Krokon derived his name from this, and was the first to perform the action. Boútriç was probably the title of the man who sacrificed the bull to Poseidon Erechtheus. Hesychos too most likely derives his name from cult officiants.1' In these cases, among others, hero, priest and genos stand very close to each other, and both hero and genos can plausibly be seen as closely derived from the priestly function, which is primary. It is true that the name-forms often make some attempt at a personal element; the -ôr|ç ending (we may say for the moment) has some force at least akin to the patronymic, and we have Kpotccovíôai, not KpoKÍSai, on the one hand, Bovtáôai, not Bowat, on the other, But the process is even more transparent in those cases where no 'patronymic' ending is found, as (H)eudanemoi, Kerykes, Bouzygai, where the genos name is simply the plural form of the hero - or perhaps more accurately, the hero is the singular form of the genos as a collective unit. What matters in the developed system is the intimate relation, almost identification, of archegete and genos members, expressed in the verbal coincidence. A similar case, although the process of development may be different, is provided by the Ionians, "Icoveç, who are simply 'Ions'. Common to the genē and their heroes, however, is the paramount importance of priestly functions. What the (H)eudanemoi did is uncertain, but the name sounds as if it is derived from some cultic function. Keryx - a hero almost certainly without a cult, incidentally24 - is simply the prototype of the herald of Apollo Pythios and perhaps of other sacred heralds. Bouzyges is the title of the holder of the chief gentilician priesthood in the Bouzygai family.25 It is also relevant that Eumolpos may have been a title of the hierophant; euphonia was, as we might expect, a desirable quality on this priest,26 but a striking statement in Plutarch (Mor. 607B) can perhaps best be explained if the hierophant was always Evpotaroç: [EfyioXrtoç] èn'&gt;T|ce Kai uvei xoùç "EXA.r|vaç, Eumolpos initiated and initiates the Greeks. We may recall in this connexion that in the later period at least his original name was suppressed on taking office, and so perhaps he actually became the mythical Eumolpos, as certain priestesses may have become the daughters of Keleos.27 But this would be a rather later development, and peculiar perhaps to Eleusis. In general, the hero seems to be simply the priest's mythical prototype. In the cases considered above, the first thing to emerge is the priest's title, which then gives its name to both hero and family, thus affording a good illustration of the hero as emphasizing - See below, p. 126. 21 Krokon: Bekker Anecd. 1.373. Boutes: Hesychius gives ßovrr)q as title of the slaughterer of the ox at the Bouphonia; given that the word is a sacral title, the gentile connexion makes it more likely to refer to the man who sacrifices a bull to Poseidon Erechtheus, a conspicuous sacrifice (//. 2.550- 1 , E. Erechtheus 65.64 Austin). The confusion would be an easy one, pace Bourriot (1332 n. 577), who wishes to separate the Eteoboutadai from the type of genos primarily defined by priestly function. But the situation may not be so clear-cut. Hesychos: see n. 18. 24 The long list of the priesthoods held by the family in the Augustan period (Roussel, Melanges Bide : (n. 37)) does not include a priest of the eponymous hero. 25 IG II2 3177, 5055, 5075; Hesperia 9 no. 15. 26 Philost. IS 2.20, cf. IG II2 3639.4. On hieronymy, see K. Clinton, The Sacred Officials of the Eleusinian Mysteries (Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc., Philadelphia 1974) 9. He supposes that the real name of one hierophant of the Roman period was Eumolpos, which is odd: p. 40 no. 28. 27 Paus. 1.31.3.</page><page sequence="77">70 THE HEROES OF ATTICA the family's identity, which is sacral; his origins lie in the need for some sort of aetiology, a reference to the first time an action was performed. He ratifies the performance of the particular cult act. In other cases, while the hero is still mythologically the founder or institutor, his name may suggest rather more complex origins. Such are Semachos, Lykos (of Phlya) and Thaulon, whose myths all show them to have been of this type, but whose names do not seem to imply any priestly function. It is impossible to say in these cases whether the function became attached to a pre-existing hero, or whether only the family was already named and the hero acquired name and function from them. In either case, the need for a mythical figure as institutor-archegete is still strong enough to assert itself. The need appears to have been in the sphere of myth, not of cult; enough has been said to show that these heroes, though perhaps insignificant as objects of worship, do fulfil an important function as figure of legendary history, as personal culture-heroes. Some of the gentile heroes do of course go on to develop a cult, as we have seen. But the form of the cult bears clear traces of its origin, for it seems as far as we can surmise to be carried out in the larger context of divine worship. We have the explicit testimony of Polemon (fr. X Preller) that Hesychos received preliminary sacrifice at the rites performed for the Semnai, and in general this was common form for the hero-institutor. We find that Eumolpos received sacrifice together with many other related heroes at the Eleusinia, while the tomb of Phytalos is near to the sacred fig-tree and a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, and the altar of Boutes (who did not, apparently, become humanised enough to acquire a tomb) is in company with those of Poseidon Erechtheus and of Hephaistos. But there are genos-heroes whose origins appear to be quite other. The only cult over which the Chari(a)dai appear to preside is that of Kranaos, localised at Lamptrai, which has no obvious connexion with either the family's name or any divine cult.28 The Euneidai, who held the priesthood of Dionysos Melpomenos, certainly connected themselves with the hero Euneos, son of Jason and Hypsipyle, but the hero is connected with the god apparently only through an obscure piece of genealogy, making him great-grandson of Dionysos.29 The cult of Kephalos at Thorikos - if indeed it has anything to do with the genos Kephalidai, which is far from clear - can hardly be connected with the sanctuary of Apollo at Aigaleos, fairly certainly a Kephalid cult-place.10 We cannot, of course, be sure that further evidence would not substantially alter the picture, but it seems here as though a more random factor is at work. Such heroes, in contrast to those we have considered earlier, seem to be in origin cultic heroes with tombs or shrines, whose worship precedes their acquiring a mythical personality. The cult comes to devolve upon a particular family, perhaps through the hero's tomb being found upon their land. (Some at least of these cases will concern genē of the village community, rather than the sacerdotal, type, but most of these genē still have characteristic cults.) In these cases, then, the hero is less instrumental in forming a sense of the family's identity. Other factors will do this, and the hero should probably be regarded as fulfilling a different function. However, there are also instances where a hero may embody an important fact about a family other than its sacerdotal role. The Salaminioi, though many things are still controversial about them, show how the large, extended type of genos could worship a variety of heroes while still apparently having a special connexion with Eurysakes, son of Ajax. It is true that Herakles at Porthmos receives a larger sacrifice and Theseus at Phaleron one of the same size,-11 but these are different places and different festivals, and not strictly comparable with the sacrifice to Eurysakes. Hsych. s.v. XapiSai. E. Hypsipyle clearly presupposes the genealogy. Further references in Roscher, Lexicon s.v. Euneos. "'Paus. 1.37.6-7. " Bourriot, I095ff.</page><page sequence="78">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, I 7 1 Eurysakes does after all symbolise the claim to be Salaminian, and his shrine at Melite was one of the places - perhaps the only place - where the decrees of the genos were set up. '2 The precise view we take of the function of Eurysakes in the life and identity of the genos must depend partly on what we believe about the genos' origins and constitution, a question too large to discuss in detail.-" Eurysakes is certainly not a hero of the 'sacral function' class, but if we suppose, as seems reasonable, that for the Salaminioi (whether they were in reality of Salaminian or Athenian origin) the important thing was to be Salaminian, it is clear that the worship of Eurysakes is of assistance. He helps to define their identity, and so his importance to the genos goes beyond the merely coincidental, whereas other families may well worship only heroes of incidental significance - the sort of figure represented in the Salaminioi decree by the 'hero at Antisara'. Others still have apparently no hero at all, a further indication that the acquisition of a hero may be a more or less random process. The Alkmaionidai, perhaps not technically a genos at all in pre-fourth-century terms, have no discernible cults, divine or heroic,14 and the same may go for the Apheidantidai and Medontidai, if again they are to be counted as genē. Even some clearly priestly families may have lacked a hero. If, as seems likely, the Kolieis had charge of the cult of Aphrodite Kolias, then the aetiologies of the cult involving kôâô and tccoXfi but making no mention of a hero might suggest that they had no hero of the priestly type." Even Lykos,. of the Lykomidai, may have had no existence before the fourth century.16 So there is no uniformity in the pattern of acquisition of heroes; they fulfil different needs to different types of families, and even cases apparently parallel do not always develop in the same way. Nevertheless, in this somewhat vague and cloudy picture some main lines are discernible. Whereas some heroic cults reach some families almost by accident, in a significant number of cases there is one hero, often eponymous to the genos, who has a clear function: that of emphasizing and impersonating the family's identity. Eurysakes, we have seen, does this for the Salaminioi. Much more often, the family's identity is expressible in terms of one main cult or priesthood; if one asks 'Who are the Eumolpidai?' the answer will be 'They are the family which provides the hierophant at Eleusis.' These priesthoods were generally, at least in the earlier period, open to all members of the genos of the appropriate sex, sortition being the method of determination most often used.17 The cults served by these gentilician priests were 12 Salaminioi decree, 84-5. "The main views are expounded in Ferguson, Hesperia 7 (1938) Iff.; Guarducci, Riv. Fil. 76 (1948) 223-37; Nilsson, Cults, myths, oracles and politics (New York 1972) 30-6. 14 See Davies, APF 369-10. " Two etymologies (one heroic, the other not) could sometimes be current at the same time, as often of deme-names (below, p. 94), but here the cult aitia have no hero-instructor. In this case the feminine character of the cult (Ar. Lys. 2) would produce difficulties in regarding its (female) priestly institutor as archegete; some more indirect relationship is required, as in the case of Hesychos. This hero, worshipped with the Semnai by Hesychid officiants, most probably derives his name from the silence required in their cult. The women officiants seem to have been known as l^cru^iSeę (Callim. fr. 681 Pf.), and the name of the genos would have been derived from this. Only then does the hero emerge, or at least become eponymous. * It is possible that he owes his existence to the AÚkod 5pU|ióç at Andania, which should probably be connected with the wolf-cults of this Messenian-South Arcadian region. The Lykomidai reorganised the Mysteries of Andania some time after the refoundation of Messene, and some genealogical-mythological justification was presumably required for this. 17 Arist. Ath.

Occasionally a particular priesthood seems more strictly hereditary, passing from father to (eldest) son; thus the dadouchia in the Kallias-Hipponikos family, an instance which is confirmed in a much later (1st c. BC) inscription (P. Roussel in Mélanges Bide: (Brussels 1934) 11.819-34). Lines 38-52 of the inscription show that the dadouchia has been passed on in strictly hereditary succession at least since the end of the third century (stemma, p. 829), even though the genos is now composed of men with many different demotics. While some</page><page sequence="79">72 THE HEROES OF ATTICA (certainly for the most part, perhaps entirely) public cults, part of the divine action of the whole city or deme, so that recognition of the special role of the genos comes not only from its own members but from all who take part.™ On the level of cult, therefore, it is this divine worship which gives the genos its identity; the actions central to such worship can be performed only by members of the group. The function of the hero as archegete-instructor is somewhat different; he operates on the different plane of myth and tradition, and it is not necessary (though it sometimes occurs) for him in addition to receive cult. The hero expresses in a concrete, pei sonai form the characteristic activity of the family; he is simply the archetype of the priest, a relation seen most clearly in those cases where hero's name and priest's title are one and the same. From this, it is a short step to the concept of the eponymous hero as actual ancestor, and as we have seen it is a step that commonly was taken, with how much seriousness is not clear, in the fifth century, and not only in Athens.11' It was pleasing to trace one's descent back to heroes and gods; but this was not the original function of these heroes. Not all the genē, indeed, have patronymic endings; some are simply identical with the name of the hero, while others are toponymie and have no eponym at all. 'Bouzygai' certainly seems to imply something different from 'Bouzygidai', but it may be doubted whether the -8r|ç termination, so often considered exclusively patronymic, does not in fact have a rather wider significance in this case. According to the standard authority,4" the termination comes to acquire first a broader meaning of descent, then tribal or ethnic sense, and the examples quoted show a wide range of 'figurative' meanings also. In the case of proper names, there are several parallels for the usage implying no notion of descent. The appellation of Homeridai for rhapsodes may be one such; the 'sons of Homer' are envisaged as modelled on him, as pursuing the activités which he initiated.41 If indeed there is a genos Pamphidai, as seems likely,42 we have a very close parallel in the sphere of the genos; these would provide sacred music and hymns, as the mythical Pamphos had done; they need not be his descendants. Again, it is clear that the names Erechtheidai, Aigeidai, and so on, applied to the ten Cleisthenic tribes - as for instance regularly in [Dem.] 60.27-31 - cannot carry a connotation of actual descent; everyone knew that these tribes were artificial creations. The hero may be áp^tlYEtriç - the primary meaning being 'leader' - without being ancestor. In the case of the genē, it seems that where a hero is important to the family's sense of identity, it is the present connexion of genos with hero, whether through religious activities or beliefs about its origins, which is significant, rather than any definite notion of the hero as ancestor. Cult paid to the archegete of the genos could in individual genē have become a phenomenon very important to the family, but it was not the starting-point. priesthoods may have been subject to different conditions, and while the lot could, perhaps, have been manipulated, it must also be borne in mind that in small genē of the Bourriot type sortition may well produce results which took hereditary. -w Cf.

The heroes of the orgeones The genos is, then, a group whose identity is perhaps most often defined by some sacral function. Commonly this function relates to a more or less public ceremony or group of ceremonies, for which the priest or other officiants are chosen from the group in question. There is in fact no certain evidence for private rites, sacrifices exclusive to the genos; such cults may have existed, but if they did were clearly of secondary importance.41 With the groups whose members were known as òpTE&amp;veç we have quite a different case; these appear to be in essence organisations constituted around their own private sacrifices. Hence the chief hero of the group signifies something very different to each of these two classes. As with the genē, the groups of orgeones present their problems of definition, and it is probable that the word was not always used to refer to precisely similar organisations.44 The significance of the well-known Philochorus fragment ( FGrH 328 F 35), referring to some type of ordinance of uncertain date which lays down that orgeones, along with homogalaktes, must be accepted by 'the phratores', has been endlessly debated. From our point of view it suffices to take the broad outlines of what seems to be the most natural picture - that membership of a group of orgeones was to be one sufficient qualification for membership of a phratry. The context of the fragment is entirely uncertain, and the phrase 'the phratores' leaves open the possibility that the reference may be to the isolated case of one phratry only, or to several but not all phratries. But even if this were true the picture would remain substantially the same: the orgeones would form well-defined groups which could be brought into connexion with other such associations in the state. The epigraphical evidence, collected and discussed by Ferguson in 1944, is more helpful.45 The material is composed of various types of decrees belonging to several different organisations whose members describe themselves as orgeones. These decrees date from the fourth century or later, but in one case, according to Ferguson's argument, incorporating a fifth- century text. Among this material, Ferguson distinguishes, surely rightly, between 'old' groups of orgeones worshipping figures of local significance only, and groups first constituted in somewhat later times, in which a foreign element both of cult and of membership is conspicuous. Only the first will concern us here; the latter class is not concerned with heroes and belongs to a very different religious system, while the workings of groups with such differently composed membership are unlikely to throw much light on those of the older type. The picture of the 'old' orgeones which emerges from the inscriptions (less informatively from literary texts)46 is one of smallish groups in which kinship was at the very least an important element. A list of orgeones from Prospalta (IG II2 2355, found at nearby Keratea) shows clearly from the nomenclature that the sixteen members are closely related one to another, forming certainly no more than four families and perhaps fewer. This inscription dates from tha third century, but it seems very likely to be representative also of an earlier state of affairs. But it would be forcing the evidence to deduce from this that kinship was the necessary and only formal criterion of membership. Where possible, it is common enough for a father to introduce his son into membership of his own social organisation, so that such associations will come to take on a certain flavour of hereditary groups even where their existence is not founded 41 Crux (n. 38) 206; but see above, p. 39. 44 Ferguson (following noie) 73, 127-30. 45 W. S. Ferguson, 'The Attic Orgeones', HTIiR 37 (1944) 61-140. This is supplemented by his "Orgeonika'. Hesperia supplement 8, 130-63.

In other cases, associations spring up around a core of family membership, but including on equal terms members who are not kin. If we should read íipoxov ôpyecòveç in the law in Solon's code relating to various associations, the groups of orgeones could be classified with phratries and genē on the one hand, and funerary associates or groups of traders on the other; in any case, the text shows many different types of association, comparable to each other in some ways, but in which the importance of kinship must have varied considerably.47 So here too, even more clearly than in the case of the genē, we should beware of the assumption that the hero particularly worshipped was the ancestor of the orgeones. We should perhaps look instead for the binding force of common rites. It is hard to imagine that the groups mentioned in the Solonian code, however constituted, did not have some common rites which might be shared by all their members. But it may be that these have a special importance among the orgeones, whose very name seems to indicate an original concern with religious activity; certainly the word appears in poetry with this primary connotation.4" Evidence closer to our purpose comes from the inscriptions themselves, however, and here the overwhelming impression is that of a cult organisation pure and simple; the activities pursued by the group all seem to be concerned with the organisation of the cult of one figure or a group of obviously related figures. These figures, when they are not foreign gods - a rather different case - have a clear heroic and local flavour. Asklepios has elements of the heroic: Echelos, Egretes and Hypodektes (Ferguson's 1, 2 and 3) are not great gods, and even when in later times they may be described as 'gods' they are obviously gods of a minor kind, whose importance is personal and restricted. But it is in precisely this restricted nature that their significance lies. Very often these figures are meaningful only to the relevant group of orgeones, and even when this is not the case we may assume that the upkeep of a particular shrine of the deity and the management of his cult was the responsibility of the orgeones alone.49 The cult then essentially defined membership; it was the most important, indeed the only, activity which members pursued together as members. The annual festival of the hero was also the annual meeting of the orgeones, who met to worship the hero. No doubt such meetings were also the occasion for discussion of the group's business and resolution of decrees. In contrast to the genos-hero the hero of the orgeones was the direct object and focus of cult, a relationship much simpler than that of the genos to its own special hero. It is no accident that Nock was induced by Ferguson's study of the orgeones and their heroes to speculate on a type of hero who is really indistinguishable from a minor god, for with one possible exception (below) these heroes have a role very like that of a god. Their human past is unimportant; their past acts explain nothing in the present. They do not in themselves represent any one of the orgeones or the group as a whole. It is simply the fact that they are worshipped especially (perhaps exclusively) by a particular group of people which is important. Thus the answer to 'What sort of group is it which includes x and y?' will be 'They meet to sacrifice to such-and-such a hero.' The group meets to worship the hero; the hero exists, at least partly, to provide a focus for the group. This may seem paradoxical, but is surely explicable in terms of the deep-rooted tendency in Greek society towards the development of many different groups and sub-groups; such small cult associations can satisfy a need different from that associated with larger groups 47 This part of Solon's code appears in the Digest, 47.22.4; cf. Seleukos FGrH 34 1 F 1 . 48 Early examples in H. Hymn. Apollo 389, Aeschylus TGrF 144; further examples in hellenistic poetry are discussed by Ferguson (art. cit., n. 45) 131-2, who is somewhat sceptical of this connotation. But there seems to be no example of the word used to refer to a primarily non-religious association. 49 See especially IG II" 2499, 2501 = Ferguson's 2 and 3.</page><page sequence="82">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, I 75 on the one hand, and the oikos on the other. So far as the evidence goes it seems to suggest that the orgeonic cults (unlike cults of the genos-heroes) were isolated religious activities, not part of a larger group of sacrifices. But there is one possible exception to this, although it must remain maddeningly speculative.5" The orgeones of Hypodektes celebrated the festival of this god or hero [o]xav íepoíç á7tavT[â)]&lt;Tiv ('when they meet the Sacred Things', IG II2 2501), which has usually been taken simply as a calendar indication (giving the date 14 Boedromion). This interpretation depends on a vague 'they' as subject of ¿whxvtökjiv, but it is equally possible that the subject should be taken as the orgeones themselves. In this case we should have a group of orgeones behaving exactly like a priestly genos, carrying out a specific function at the Eleusinia and having a connexion with a hero who was the first to perform this rite ( 'Y 7toÔ£KTt1ç = the receiver, i.e. of the 'sacred things' from Eleusis into Athens). (Against this we might argue that Hypodektes is referred to as a god, which does not seem to square well with a priestly institutor-hero, a pattern in which the distinction between god and hero is of the utmost significance.) A group of orgeones connected with the larger system of the Eleusinia would seem to bear a closer resemblance to other groups within Attic society, and although this pattern seems from our evidence to be rare,51 it may be that the groups of orgeones included both such organisations and the other, more ad hoc type. As with the genē, we need not expect that all groups with the same name have an identical structure - especially perhaps as in this case it is only the members, not the collective group, to which the name applies. Within such associations, there may too have been degrees of belonging: the third-century decree of the orgeones of Echelos and the heroines (Ferguson 1) shows that there are two associations within the group, devoted respectively to Echelos and to the heroines, although the sacrifices were organised in connexion with each other, and the two groups therefore met together at the same occasion. There may have been many variations on this somewhat more complicated type of structure, but the evidence is so scanty that anything more is mere speculation. The same may be said of the further significance of the hero to the orgeones; it is possible that individual orgeones could have turned to their orgeonic hero for help in cases of need, but the only thing we can safely predicate of the hero is his role in defining group membership. Although the gaps in the documentation of the various groups and associations of Attica are such that negative evidence is not generally of much value, it is perhaps worth remarking what seems at first sight a strange anomaly: there is no satisfactory evidence of hero-cult in the phratries. (The evidence for a hero Ther(r)ikles connected with the phratry Therrikleidai really depends on conjecture.52) This is the more remarkable because we are tolerably well-informed of certain other religious practices connected with the phratries, most obviously the celebration of the Apatouria and the worship of Zeus Phratrios and Athena Phratria. Yet in contrast to the religious practices of the genē and the groups of orgeones, these are rites performed by all the phratries, which come together one by one, it is true, but each to perform the same actions. There is nothing distinctive to any phratry in its worship of Zeus Phratrios (even if we 5(1 1 owe this suggestion to Dr Robert Parker. 51 See Ferguson (n.45) 72; the only comparable case seems to be the orgeones of Bendis, a group of rather different origins. 52 The phratry Therrik[leid]ai appears without doubt in IG II2 4973, where they appear to have a sanctuary of Apollo Patroos. The Ther[ik]leion of IG I-* 243, situated in the south-eastern part of the agora, may, as Meritt suggests (Hesperia 36 (1967) 72-4), indicate a shrine of a related hero Therikles, but other interpretations are possible.</page><page sequence="83">76 THE HEROES OF ATTICA understand this to mean 'its own' Zeus Phratrios- ) or the other actions of the festival, the feasting and the registration of children. By performing such actions, each phratry is affirming that it is a phratry, in every respect comparable to other such groups. Ritual acts performed by genos or orgeones mark off the group from those outside it, a simple division of inside and outside; the Apatouria, on the other hand, marks each phratry as distinct from the others, but belonging to a system which embraces the whole citizen group. This is rather the distinction we would expect if we accept the minimalising view of the genos outlined above; the genos is in some ways a rather specialised affair, quite different in conception from the phratry. We should also remember that Apatouria were celebrated in almost all Ionian cities, and indeed were regarded as a touchstone of Ionian identity (Hdt. 1.147). Roussel very properly cautions us against the belief that there were therefore phratries in all these cities, but it seems nonetheless likely that we have to do with some deep-seated system structuring and dividing the whole of society. Similar divisions appear even in some non-Ionian cities.54 This being so - the division being presumably accepted and understood by all who were involved in it, the whole citizen body - there is the less need for particular groups of this son to define themselves by distinctive rites.55 It is not impossible that the phratries, or some of them, may have had in addition other, particular, cults, but it is clear enough that the main religious expression of the group's identity was the Apatouria. Evidence such as the íepòv Meôovxtô&amp;v gets us little further;56 this is perhaps most likely to be formally sacred to Zeus Phratrios and Athena Phratria. The lack of a statement of dedication may be support for the view that there was only this one phratry cult, and would incidentally demonstrate that the actual gods worshipped were in a sense secondary to the phratry's perception of itself and the sacred guarantee of its own identity. One further possible association of the phratries - though it is not exclusive to them - is with the cult of Tritopatreis or Tritopatores. These mysterious figures, though often identified by ancient writers as figures of primaeval antiquity or as natural forces,57 seem in origin to be rather more specialised and personal deities, very likely ancestors in some sense, as their name suggests.5* Worship of unspecified Tritopatreis is attested in Athens itself (a shrine in the Kerameikos area) and at Marathon and Erchia,51' but we also find specific Tritopatreis with family-type names in the comparable boundary-markers opoç íepoů Tpnomipeíov ZaicuaSôv 53 This seems lo he lhe concept implicit in Plato.

In Athens it is probably the case that membership of a phratry was not essential for citizenship (P.J. Rhodes, CQ ns 28 (1978) 91-2), but it clearly remained the norm and in some cases could be crucial in detemiining citizenship.

The eponymous heroes of the pre-Cleisthenic tribes are very shadowy figures and are perhaps unlikely to have received cult. 5i&gt; 'Shrine of the Medontidai' or 'Sacred: Property of the Medontidai' Hesp. 10 ( 1941 ) 16 no.

It is true that the (presumed) genos of the Pyrrhakidai, or some part of them, do seem to have a Tritopator (one only) of their own, but this need not be an exact parallel. The shrine is at Delos and may represent a special case; perhaps an ancestral claim to certain rites was more important on pan-Ionian Delos than on home territory? The Pyrrhakidai have also their own nymphs.61 But in any case, the Tritopatreis of the Kerameikos, Marathon and Erchia demonstrate that diversely constituted groups could have Tritopatreis; they cannot be an exclusive possession of genos or phratry or any other type of group. But normally, if the view adopted above of the distinction in kind between phratry and genos is correct, it must be the case that considerations of heredity and kinship relate primarily to phratry rather than to genos. It is to the phratry that citizen boys and girls62 are presented, and membership of a phratry is very often used along with deme registration to prove citizenship;61 at the Apatouria sacrifices are made for the marriage of girls. Relevant to the latter point may be the statement of Phanodemus that Athenians before their marriage pray to the Tritopatreis for children;64 the ancestors thus guarantee the continuity of their line, and very easily come into connexion with the chief concerns of the phratry. This is something quite different from the non-ancestral heroes of the genē. The genos heroes have a special character which is particularly relevant to the individual identity of the genos. The hero of the orgeones is the centre of the group's existence, that which gives them coherence. The particular concerns expressed by specialised heroes of this sort are of less importance to the phratry than are the principles of heredity and continuance, and hence the Tritopatreis, as ancestors, seem appropriate here - although they cannot of course be as important and distinctive to phratry-organisation as Zeus Phratrios and Athena Phratria. If these are heroes, they are heroes of a very special kind, being apparently undifferentiated as individuals.65 It is not their personality as such that is important, but merely the fact that they are forebears. 60 'Boundary of the shrine of the Tritopatreis of the Zakyadai(/Euergidai)' or 'of the Zakyad (/Euergid) Tritopatreis', IG II2 2615; Hesp. 30 (1961) 26* no. 80. 61 1 user, de Délos 66, 67; discussed by P.

Not only did new small, private groups continue to spring up, but often enough it was possible to make new official divisions of the population along both tribal and regional lines. In Attica, the reforms of Cleisthenes were both sudden and far-reaching. Although many of the old groups continued to exist (for some religious purposes even the old Ionian tribes continued in use'), a new division of the community now superseded them in general importance. The tribe was the new unit of military assembly; the deme expressed a man's identity as a citizen, as well as his local loyalties. Naturally the new units received religious expression, whether this occurred in a deliberate and organised manner (as in the case of the tribes) or more haphazardly and spontaneously. This expression was mainly and most obviously concentrated in the sphere of the heroic, whether in cult or myth or both; most often, a particular hero, usually eponymous, sums up the group's identity and traditions. 1. The Cleisthenic tribes The tribal reforms of Cleisthenes, involving the assignment of the ten new tribes to ten heroes, constitute perhaps the most obvious Athenian example of the state's role in the fostering of cult. Legislative processes established the tribes, and an official consultation of Delphi determined or perhaps rather sanctioned the assignation of a hero to each tribe. But it is clear from the account in Arist. Ath. Pol. 21.6 that this process did not involve the creation of new cults; all the heroes were the objects of pre-existing worship. Naturally, we know pitifully little about the pre-Cleisthenic cults of the soon-to-be tribal heroes; all that can be deduced is the area of Attica to which each cult was native. While Ajax comes from Salamis and Hippothon from Eleusis, the other heroes seems to be chiefly from Athens itself, although some have possible additional connexions with other parts of Attica.2 Aristotle speaks of the hundred pre- selected heroes put forward as ótpxTyÉxai, which although it may be little more than a synonym for 'hero' does suggest that like so many heroes these played a part in the mythical foundation or strengthening of their particular area, or of Attica in general. Nothing in this sets the eponymous heroes apart from many others, or suggests that Aristotle's statement that the Pythia chose the final ten out of a list of a hundred should not be believed. More details emerge only from a study of the post-Cleisthenic, tribal cult. Here perhaps the most conspicuous feature is the close connexion of the tribe's affairs with its eponym. The hero's shrine acted as a kind of centre for the whole tribe, as can be seen most 1 The Nikomachos calendar, LSS 10, 47. 2 Erechiheus: at Marathon or Rhamnous, Nonnus 39.210-3 (vcténiç Mapaô&amp;voç), Suda, Phot. s.v.

In the individual heroön there would be more room, and hence more permanence, than by the statues of the eponymoi in the agora. From a rather mutilated decree of Hippothontis, found at Eleusis (IG II2 1149), it appears that the announcement of the honour was also made in the shrine, which suggests that members of the tribe were assembled there for sacrifice. In the case of Pandionis it is certain that the tribe held an assembly in connexion with a religious function, the Pandia, in the first quarter of the fourth century (IG II2 1 140). At the àyopá after the festival, when the tribe was most conveniently gathered at the sanctuary of Pandion, decrees would presumably be moved and announcements made.4 A decree of Kekropis (IG II2 1 141) states that it was passed at the tribe's Kupía àyopá, held on the acropolis (presumably at the Kekropion); thus other tribe assemblies will have taken place during the year, but this one was fixed and regular.5 Probably it took place after some public festival. Just so the Pandia are more than an exclusive assembly of the tribe for their own rites; this is a recognised public festival. Apart from Ajax, whose celebrations on Salamis were relatively inaccessible, and whose tribal shrine was in any case in Athens, Pandion is the only eponymous hero we know definitely to be associated with a public festival, but it seems very likely that all or most of them received a subordinate sacrifice at some public rite, at which the tribe would then be present in strength.6 If the Pandia were a festival of Zeus, as the Panathenaia of Athena, it is nonetheless clear that Pandion received a lesser sacrifice and was very probably regarded as the hero-founder of the rite.7 The Pandia, then, although a city festival, were also particularly the festival of Pandionis, so that members of the tribe would be seen by the public in general to occupy a special position with regard to festival and hero. While most of the eponymoi had shrines in Athens, Ajax and Hippothon are in a special position, their cults centring respectively on Salamis and Eleusis. It is interesting that these two eponymoi, along with Oineus, are omitted from the Marathon monument at Delphi in favour of Theseus, Kodros and the otherwise unknown Phileus (who is often suspected of being a corruption, perhaps of Philaios or Neleus), and it is an attractive though daring suggestion that a revision of the tribal heroes may have been made, incorporating helpful heroes from outside the acm&gt;, subsequently to the original reforms, in the wake of the final victory over the Persians." There are, however, other reasons for including such heroes in the list, and for the J Pandionis: chiefly IG II2 1 138, 1 157, 1 144, 1 148; see further D. M. Lewis, ABSA 50 (1955) 22, for a list of texts which may have been set up in the shrine of Pandion. Akamantis: Mitsos, Äpx- 'Eq&gt;. (1965) 13 Iff.

Aigeus may well have played a part in the Theseia or Oschophoria. and as founder of certain divine cults (below n. 55) he is likely to have received a sacrifice at the related festivals. Erichthonios, a figure close to Erechtheus and possibly identical with him in cult, was credited with the institution of the Panathenaia (Hellanikos FGrH 323a F 2; Androtion ib. 324 F 2; Marm. Par. AIO. See J. D. Mikalson. 'Erechtheus and the Panathenaia', AJP 97 (1976) 141-53). The appearance of the priest of Hippothon in the Eleusinian accounts (IG II2 1672.290) makes his part in a larger festival certain. 7 The lexicographers speak of the Pandia as a festival of Zeus: Phot., Etym. M. s.v., Pollux 1 .37. They are followed by Wilamowitz ( Der Glaube der Hellenen 1.277, 2.3 n. 2), and Deubner, 176-7. A Pandion-Pandia connexion would seem to supply an incompatible etymology, but such logical problems are in fact common: see pp. 93-4 and p. 71 n. 35. * This is suggested by Mr A. H. Griffiths, in an as yet unpublished paper. In his theory, the presence of Hippothon is to be explained by the divine intervention at Eleusis, Hdt. 8.65, while the relevance of Ajax and Salamis to the</page><page sequence="89">82 THE HEROES OF ATTICA moment this hypothesis must remain unverifiable. In any case, it is clear enough that Ajax originally had no cult in the city; the Athenian hero was Eurysakes, perhaps at first a nameless hero connected with a shield and only later identified as Ajax 's (post-Homeric) son.9 This identification would almost certainly take place during the long sixth-century quarrel with Megara over Salamis, so that Ajax's cult was probably introduced at Eurysakes' sanctuary at Melite well before his adoption as eponymos.10 It is clear anyway that Aiantis did use the Eurysakeion as its centre in the fourth century," and it can hardly be the case that the Salaminian sanctuary was ever used by the tribe. Salamis stood outside the local tribal divisions and was not part of Attica. Later, in the late second century, we find references to an Athenian Aianteion,12 which may or may not be the Eurysakeion; it is clear that Ajax became more established at Athens as time went on. Pausanias refers rather vaguely to his 'honours among the Athenians', napà Aíhivaíoiç tīļaai (1.35.3), but to Herodotus, speaking of the eponymous heroes, he is an outsider, a bit of an anomaly, àaruTEÍxova Kai crú|i|iaxov, Çeîvov éóvta.11 In the fifth century he was still a Salaminian, accommodated only by courtesy at the altar of his son at Melite.14 Hippothon, on the other hand, was no foreigner, but unassailably Attic.15 He was an Eleusinian hero pure and simple; no details of cult or myth connect him with any other part of Attica. Whether he was originally connected with the Mysteries, or, as is perhaps more probable, was only later drawn into their orbit, in the later fourth century sacrifice was certainly made to him in connexion with Demeter and Kore. 16 Pausanias ( 1 .38.4) mentions the heroön of Hippothon, which must be the Hippothontion of inscriptions (IG II2 1 149, found at Eleusis; 1 163). The tribe follows the cult-organisation of its eponym; it is clear that Hippothontis had its headquarters at Eleusis, where two honorary decrees from the first half of the fourth century victory over the Persians is obvious. Oineus might perhaps be connected with Oinoe towards Flataia. For an alternative (not, in my view, very attractive) solution to the problem of the Marathon monument (Paus. 10.10.1) see P. Vidal-Naquet, 4 An enigma at Delphi', The Black Hunter (Baltimore 1986) 302-15. 9 Thus W. S. Ferguson, Hesperia 1 (1938) 16; the mythical identification of a hero anonymous in cult is a very common phenomenon, as for instance when two different heroes, at Phaleron and in the Kerameikos, are both thought to be Androgeos son of Minos (see Appendix 1 s.v.). But it is also possible that the cult was founded as that of Ajax's suitably named son. 10 Contra Ferguson, above. For the use of Ajax and his sons in this quarrel, compare the story that Ajax's sons Philaios and Eurysakes took Athenian citizenship and made over Salamis to Athens, Plut. Sol. 10, Paus. 1.35.1 - a transparent invention; and the famous line in the Catalogue, //. 2.557 (with 7.198, the only Homeric passage to connect Ajax with Salamis at all, though his cult is obviously old there). 1 1 Hesperia 1 ( 1 938) 94 no. 3 (= Agora I 3625), dated 327/6. 12 The ephebic decrees IG II2 1008 (line 87) and Hesperia 24 (1955) 140-1 (Agora I 286). The latter contains five ephebic decrees: one is to crriļcrai [é]v tön xEnévei toû Aïavxoç, the others to crriļoai év à-yopâi. IG I3 426.7 may provide a fifth-century reference to an Aianteion: see Lewis, AB SA 50 ( 1955) 16 n. 40. 11 5.66.2: 'an ally and a neighbour of the town, a foreigner.' 14 A cup of the Codrus Painter (pl. 6A, ARV 2 1268.1 = Brammer3 379.B1), dated 440-30, shows Ajax and Menestheus as departing warriors, accompanied by Athena, Lykos and Melite. The precise mythological details are uncertain, but the Athenian emphasis is clear. 15 One might at first sight suspect Arcadian connexions: the Tegean Hippothoös was like the Attic hero connected with Poseidon, and son of Kerkyon as Hippothon was his grandson. Moreover, Plut. Thes. 1 1 makes the Eleusinian Kerkyon come from Arcadia. Curiously Hippothoös too was the eponym of a tribe at Tegea (Paus. 8.53.6, confirmed by numerous inscriptions). But there is no sign that the two were identified by Athenians or Tegeans, though if we had Euripides' Mope we might receive a different picture. As far as we can see, Hippothon was securely Eleusinian: Ex)'íoXko&lt;; Aótaxóç te Kai 'Ituioúóídv jueyá^iioq (from an unknown epic, Hesiod fr. 227 M-W). A bell-krater of the Oreithyia Painter (ARV2 496.5) shows Hippothon as a bystander at the Mission of Triptolemos. But the scholiast to Nicander, Alexiph. 131 is merely misunderstanding his text in making Hippothon take the place of Keleos as Demeter' s host. 16 The Eleusinian temple accounts of 329/8 record the expenses of a itéXavoç to the priest of Hippothon (IG II2 1672.290).</page><page sequence="90">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, II 83 have been found (IG II2 1 149, 1 153). A later decree of the tribe (ib. 1 163, now dated 284/3) was found in Athens, and states that one copy should be set up in the Asklepieion and one at the Hippothontion. But this is a special case, as the man honoured was priest of Asklepios; there is nothing to suggest that keeping copies of the tribal decrees in the city was normal practice. In this case at least, cult usage was more important than practical considerations for tribal affairs, and the tribal cult reflects the pre-Cleisthenic, uncentralised situation. Of course there were central elements in the cults; the eponymoi had their statues in the agora, where officials, tribal and other, posted their notices.17 It is very likely that some sort of collective cult centred around these statues, at least in the fourth century, as the inventory of an unidentified hero- shrine in the agora mentions ten kylikes belonging to the eponymoi, dedicated by the boule in 328/7. 18 The ten could own property in close connexion, perhaps in common, and the dedication here suggests that all were in some sense present in the agora.19 Their cult as a group would clearly be an official matter, the business of the representatives of the state as a whole. But the existing cult-structure, no doubt with new, 'official' elements, remained alongside the new groups. Even the innovation in bringing Ajax to Athens probably antedates Cleisthenes. The eponymous heroes were not simply a decorative element designed to lend an air of verisimilitude to the new groups; the corporate life of the tribe was to a large extent organised round the pre-existing cults and traditions of the heroes. The hero eponymous to the group was, of course, a phenomenon already in existence. The gene must already have had their traditions of an eponymous hero, whom in some cases they worshipped. And some localities, as we shall see, almost certainly boasted heroes with names similar to their own. In both these cases, the eponymous hero had a special significance to the group; the coincidence in name signified a coincidence in substance, and the hero was in some senses the projection of the group itself onto the plane of myth or cult or both, and its expression in a unified, individualised form. Even the idea of heroes as tribal patrons was not new, it seems; by the time of Herodotus, and probably much earlier, the four old Ionian tribes had come to be regarded as named after the sons of Ion. Thus it is that Herodotus can speak of the Cleisthenic eponymoi as 'other heroes' (ëxepoi fíptoeç, 5.66), although we know nothing of any cult of the four pre-Cleisthenic tribal heroes. With this background it was all the easier for the new heroes, and the new tribes, to fit in and be felt as something more than nice-sounding fictions. Some measure of continuity was important; perhaps rather unexpectedly, it is clear that Cleisthenes did not always choose heroes who had no cult managed by an important family or genos, or even institute a new, non- gentilician cult of an important family's hero, and so weaken that family's connexion with him. xá 8è 7ÉVT1 Kai xáç &lt;ppaxpíaç eïaaev è^eiv éicáaxouç Kaxá xà jtáxpia: he allowed everyone to keep their genē, their phratries, and their priesthoods according to ancestral custom. Thus the Ath. Pol. (21.6) testifies to the conservative elements in the Cleisthenic reforms, and it is broadly true that there was more of addition than substitution in the ways society was divided.2" Aristotle's statement does not preclude additions to the structure of the priesthoods, and after 17 On the history and functions of this monument, see T.

Lewis, ZPE 36 (1979) I31tt. 19 The testimony of Dem. 24.8 and 43.58 is, as Rotroff says, ambiguous, but with the inscription it becomes more likely that money belonging to the group as a whole is meant. 20 Cf.

Some material is necessarily re-examined here.</page><page sequence="91">84 THE HEROES OF ATTICA the creation of the new tribes any of the eponymous heroes could theoretically have been the object of three cults, in the sense of being worshipped by three distinct groups of people - state, genos and tribe.21 So, in the second century after Christ, Dionysos Melpomenos had a Euneid priest and a priest from the technitai (IG II2 5056, 5060). But the epigraphical evidence goes against a parallel situation in the cases of the eponymoi. Kekrops is an eponymous hero, yet still in the late first century BC his priest is a member of the genos of the Amynandridai. The cult in question is surely the major state cult of Kekrops, in which the whole city was involved, but the priest could in theory have performed sacrifice on behalf of the genos only. Did he also perform a priestly function for the tribe Kekropis? A late third century prytany decree of the tribe suggests that he may have done;22 there the 'priest of the epony mos' 21 belongs not to Kekropis as one might expect, but either to the deme Potamos, divided at that time between Leontis and Antigonis, or else to Paiania (Pandionis). There is no proof that he was an Amynandrid, but this is surely the most likely explanation. Kekrops, then, was served by one priest only, in accordance with custom before Cleisthenes. The organisation of the hero's priesthood presents a disparate picture throughout the tribes.24 In six or seven tribes (Aigeis, Pandionis, Leontis, probably Akamantis,25 Oineis, Aiantis and Antiochis) the prytany decrees show that the priest of the eponymos is a member of the tribe in question. The most complete evidence comes from Pandionis, where there are also other types of document which show that the 'priest of Pandion' as well as the 'priest of the eponymos' was a member of Pandionis; the two titles should certainly be identified.26 But for Erechtheus and Hippothontis, as well as Kekropis, the decrees show that the priest of the eponymos did not necessarily belong to the relevant tribe.27 We know of the important gentilician priesthoods of Poseidon Erechtheus and of Kekrops, while the appearance of the priest of Hippothon in the Eleusinian temple accounts suggests that this priesthood too was an old-established (and therefore presumably gentilician) one. Further, the same man is priest of the eponymos for Hippothontis in at least two, possibly three, separate years and may be succeeded by his son; this looks like a gentilician rather than a 'political' priesthood, where annual tenure and the use of sortition from among a large group are the norm.28 The case of Erechtheis has been much 21 But there is no actual evidence of cults exclusive to a genos: see p. 73. 22 Agora XV no. 1 32 = Dow, Prytaneis no. 3 1 . 21 It is difficult to see what function the priest of the eponymos can have if, for example, in the case of Pandionis he is not identical with the priest of Pandion. It is true that the title is not attested until the latter part of the third century, but Feaver (below, n. 24) plausibly connects this with a growing tendency to abandon the name of the hero and call him simply ó éncbvunoç. (Similarly, a little earlier, the prytany lists cease to have the form of a dedication; the second development at least may reflect a decline in the religious force behind the conventions.) Certainly the priest of the eponymos need not be a member of the tribe in question, and it is precisely the cults we know or securely assume to have gentilician priesthoods where we find that the priest of the eponymos is not a member of the tribe. 24 The priests of the eponymos are best summarised in Agora XV 12ff. Priests of named eponymous heroes: R. Feaver, ÏCS 15(1957) 135. 2S We have only one piece of evidence for Akamantis, the prytany decree Agora XV 128 (= Pritchett, Hesp. 9 (1940) 1 16, but cf. his change of mind in Hesp. 10 (1941) 395, Hesp. 15 (1946) 146-7). The reading is dependent on restoration, and the priest of the eponymos may belong either to Sphettos (Akamantis) or to Aphidna (Aiantis); editors generally accept that Sphettos is more probable. -6 Above, n. 23. 27 Agora XV 98; 132, 261; 193, 205, 226, 243. 2lt The lot of course was typically used within the genos, but the number of eligible candidates was obviously much smaller. Life tenure in the 'political' priesthood is unusual at an early period, although it becomes more common later, for instance in the priesthood of Asklepios. The usual assumption (still in R. S. J. Garland, 'Religious authority in archaic and classical Athens', ABSA 79 (1984) 90-1) that the priestess of Athena Nike, who occupied a position created in the fifth century, held office for life depends on a conjectural restoration in IG 1 2 24; in the</page><page sequence="92">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, II 85 disputed, but a prytany decree showing that the priest of the eponymos is a member of Kekropis seems to imply that this priest too was the gentile one - in this case presumably the Eteoboutad priest of Poseidon Erechtheus.29 (See Appendix 3.) There was then much diversity in the individual cults of the eponymous heroes, both in cult- places and more particularly in priesthoods. We are not dealing with the arbitrary imposition of a new set of cults, uniform in their structure. Presumably before 508/7 each of the eponymoi had received some cult on the old gentilician pattern (Ajax is a possible exception, if with Ferguson we believe that he had no cult in Attica proper before Cleisthenes). What other cult could they have had, unless it were completely sporadic and unconnected? This pattern was plainly not abandoned totally; while it is possible that the priesthoods of some cults were transferred to the tribe immediately in 508/7, it is perhaps more likely that the changes occurred disparately during the course of the fifth century, for which we have no evidence, or even later. Religious conservatism played its part in the establishment of the eponymoi; on the other hand, the way the situation changes is consonant with the character of Cleisthenes' reforms. The simple model which has Cleisthenes taking power out of the hands of the aristocrats by removing their religious privileges will clearly not apply here. The old Amynandrid priest continues to serve Kekrops - but there is a difference. Such cult organised along gentilician lines served as we have seen (among other things) to articulate a special relationship between the god or hero worshipped and the family from whom his priest was drawn. Kekrops was worshipped by and on behalf of the whole city, it is true, but nonetheless the whole city could see his particular connexion with the Amynandridai (for a parallel we need only think of the special place of the Eumolpidai and to a lesser extent the Kerykes in all matters connected with the Mysteries). After Cleisthenes, this special place of course remained, but was overlaid by another connexion, that of Kekrops with the newly formed tribe of Kekropidai, a tenth of all Athenian citizens selected with no regard to immemorial divisions in the citizenry, and the Amynandrid priest will offer sacrifice on behalf not only of the more abstract people as a whole, but for this new motley group as well.30 Again, at the Pandia, a public festival for the whole city - this is particularly emphasized in the prefix Pan- - all participants can see the special status of the Pandionidai, just as before and still after Cleisthenes the Plynteria, for instance, displayed the special status of the Praxiergidai. This kind of relationship had previously been confined to members of genē and perhaps to orgeones; after the reforms, whether deliberately or not, this uniqueness was destroyed and every citizen would experience such special status at one time or another. But did the 'démocratisation' of the ten cults result in any real feeling of attachment by the phyletai to their own hero? The answer depends on the level at which we look. We know of only one apparently private dedication to the eponymos appropriate to the demotic, made by two brothers from Pergase in Erechtheis to Poseidon Erechtheus in the fifth century (IG I2 580). Moving up to deme level, the evidence remains exiguous, but may suggest a distinction notes to this inscription's new incarnation as IG l' 35 we are assured that [Sia ßio iepâta]t 'vestigiis non respondent'. 29 Agora XV no. 98. 30 But it is unlikely that the priest's ability to organise the cult was very far limited by tribal officials. The ējti(ieX,iļtai, who belonged to the tribe, do not seem to have had many specifically religious duties. In IG II - 1 152, they are given fifty drachmae towards a sacrifice, but here they are the outgoing officials giving thanks for a successful year in office, and in IG II2 2818 they make a dedication in similar circumstances. The prytany board certainly had stated sacrifices to perform, as their innumerable decrees inform us, but not to their eponymos. and in a state capacity, not a tribal one. An inscription of the second century after Christ (SEG XVII.8I) reveals a ÇctKOpoç Tü)v ôeícov eÌKÓvcav belonging to Akamantis (evidently this cult possessed several images), but this is a minor official.</page><page sequence="93">86 THE HEROES OF ATTICA between city and outlying denies. Within fifty years of the establishment of the Cleisthenic tribes we find sacrifice performed to Leos in the city deme of Skambonidai. Skambonidai does belong to Leontis, but the connexion is (irritatingly) not quite certainly tribal: the Leokoreion, which (at least in the fourth century) was the site of a cult of Leos' daughters, was certainly near and perhaps within the deme.11 There may be some contamination, but nonetheless the daughters fail to feature in the lex sacra , suggesting that it is indeed Leos the tribal eponym we have to deal with. Again, at the Dipylon gate in the deme Kerameis (the boundary of the inner and outer Kerameikos) we find a third-century altar apparently dedicated to Zeus Herkeios, Hermes and Akamas; since there is no other evidence for a cult of Akamas in Kerameis, he probably owes his presence in this Akamantid deme to the Cleisthenic reforms.12 But as far as we can tell the outlying demes do not seem to maintain a cult of their tribal heroes, either within their own boundaries or on a deme basis at the hero's main shrine. At Erchia we find no mention of Aigeus, at Thorikos no trace of Akamas. Such a discrepancy, if indeed it is a real discrepancy and not due merely to the incomplete state of the evidence, is not too surprising; the inhabitants of Athens itself, the acm&gt;, would more easily become familiar with the eponymoi, because they had more or less easy access to the agora and to the heroes' various sanctuaries, most of which were in or near Athens itself. But on another level it would seem that while the remoter demes, each with its own strongly defined traditional cults and myths," might take less interest in the tribal eponymoi, for the individual demesman the position might be different. The heroes in the deme calendars are by and large local ones - the hero over the plain, the hero by the Hellotion - of little interest to anyone outside the deme, but important to those who belonged. Aigeus and Akamas could hardly encroach on their functions. Yet when the demesman came to town, though deme consciousness still no doubt remained strong within him, other groups also claimed his loyalty. His civic and military duties were performed alongside men from quite other parts of Attica, to whom he was however united by the tie of the tribe. As he fought or sat on the prytany board with such men, so he joined them in sacrificing to the eponymous hero he shared with them.14 For him the cult of this hero was not, could not be, a rival to that of the old deme heroes; as the worship of the heroes back home was essential to the identity and continuity of the deme, the worship of the eponymoi expressed each man's identity in the larger Athenian context. A changed political situation has added new religious functions to be filled, and the cult in its turn acts as a guarantee of the political system. But the most direct evidence for the significance of the eponymoi occurs in the funeral speech [Dem.] 60.27ff, and the significance lies in myth rather than in cult.15 The tribal division is 11 Thompson's location of the Leokoreion (Hesperia 50 (1981) 347-8) has not been universally accepted. It is just possible that àicáuavToç is an otherwise unknown epithet of Hermes, but Köhler's explanation (AM 4 (1879) 288) is usually accepted. 11 Cf. Paus. 1.31.1-6. 14 The normal pilące for this sacrifice would be at the relevant festival, which would be followed by a tribal assembly (thus IG II- 1 140). The prytaneis, on the expiry of their term of office, might make a dedication to their eponymos; thus IG II2 1742 = Agora XV 13, a dedication to Leos by the outgoing prytaneis. Similar documents are collected most easily in Ag. XV 1-56. Most fourth-century prytany lists are in the form of a dedication, although it is not always stated to whom, and sometimes it is to figures other than the eponymos. In a military setting, we hear of a sacrifice performed by Aiantis after Plataia, though to the Sphragitic nymphs local to the battlefield, not to Ajax. But silence need not be indicative. 15 See R. Stupperich, Staatsbegräbnis und Privatdenkmal im klassisc hen Athen (Münster 1977) 49-50, who argues that this feature of the speech is an innovation of the orator. On the ÈJtliacpioç Xóyoç in general, see N. Loraux, L'invention d'Athènes (Paris 1981), esp. 1 33-56 (= The Invention of Athens (Cambridge, Mass. 1986) 132-55).</page><page sequence="94">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, II 87 natural to a military context™ and here the orator, having praised the dead in general, turns to each tribe and traces a connexion between the courage and patriotism of the fallen and some element in the mythology of the eponymoi. As often as not the connexion is rather forced as the author somewhat desperately picks out for mention the heroes' children or merely mentions their divine fathers. But evidently he thought this suitably stirring stuff, which suggests that similar mythological thoughts may have been in the minds of the phyletai themselves, at least where the less shadowy heroes were concerned. It would be natural to take a sympathetic interest in the exploits of one's own eponymos. But if myth was important in the original choice of the eponymoi, the myths would frequently have been other than those used by this orator. It is only by special pleading that the actions of Prokne and Philomela can be made praiseworthy, and in any case Pandion, with his shrine on the acropolis, is surely more than just the father of these two. When we look at the traditions attaching to the ten figures, there is no completely uniform mythological thread which connects them all, just as their cults show no unity either in place or in organisational form. Nonetheless, we have seen that very broadly the cults of the tribal heroes went some way towards supplementing natural local feeling with a sense of pan-Attic identity which cut across regional divisions, and to some extent this unifying function is mirrored in the myths associated with the heroes. Just as a majority of the cults are centred o.i Athens, so too the myths show a greater proportion of 'interesting' heroes than a purely random selection from the hundred names submitted by Cleisthenes should do. There are four Attic kings among the ten, one son of a king, and a sixth, Leos, whose role in myth looks like a king's, though he fails to feature in the king-lists.17 (Of course cult and myth are inseparable here; the heroes who have cult in Athens more easily develop into those who are known all over Attica.) This is not the only factor suggesting that the Attic synoecism is being stressed; although Theseus himself is not an eponymous hero, both his father Aigeus and his son Akamas are.11' For [Dem.] 60, indeed, the salient feature of Aigeus is precisely that his son was Theseus, despite the fact that he was also known as the founder of several cults.19 The importance of Theseus in the last years of the tyranny and those immediately following is too well known to need further emphasis.40 His significance lies both in his quasi-epic character, with his saga of adventures - an Attic answer to Herakles - anu in his claim to have effected the Attic synoecism (and perhaps even to have established a proto-democracy). Erechtheus the warrior has also some synoecistic claims, as does Kekrops, whose Dodekapolis foreshadows a united Attica, and both, of course, are directly represented among the tribes. Among the kings Pandion perhaps has special significance, too; he was the hero of the Pandia, which as we have seen was most likely a synoecistic festival of Zeus. Probably he was regarded as the first to celebrate this festival, in which all the inhabitants of Attica were to take part. The tradition of the division of Attica among his four sons,41 implying his own rule over the whole of it, may also go back to 16 Funerals and monuments of the war dead were always arranged on a tribal basis: Thuc. 2.34.3, and cf. IG I* 929. 943. In Thuc. 7.69, a moment of great emotional power, Nikias calls upon each trierarch individually by name, patronymic and tribe. 17 That is, the sacrifice of his daughters. In Attica it is the king's daughters who die to save their country, as the daughters of Erechtheus and, in some versions, Kekrops' daughter Aglauros (see above, p. 59). 111 Theseus does however appear with the eponymoi at Delphi (Paus. 10. 10. 1) and it is possible that originally he belonged to their number; see above, pp. 81-2, n. 8. Antiochos, as son of Herakles, is perhaps comparable with Akamas the son of Theseus. It is also possible that Hippothon was sometimes thought of as Theseus's son: this seems to be the implication of Istros FGrH 334 F 10. 19 See n. 55. 40 See below, pp. 1 17-9. 41 Philochorus FGrH 328 F 94; see below, pp. 1 15-7.</page><page sequence="95">88 THE HEROES OF ATTICA Cleisthenic times; the idea that this was a second king Pandion must be the work of later genealogists. But there were aspects to be stressed other than the Athenian and centralising. Beside Erechtheus, conqueror of Eleusis, is the Eleusinian Hippothon; it is probably no accident that it is the holiest area of Attic soil, the place which conveyed the benefits of civilisation to the world, as the Proerosia advertised,42 which is most obviously represented among the outlying areas of Attica. Some heroes who are primarily Athenian have also extra-Athenian connexions within Attica: Erechtheus in Marathon or Rhamnous, for instance, Leos perhaps in Hagnous (if two heroes of this name were identified41), Akamas probably in Marathon.44 Thus their newfound importance stresses the bond between Athens and the Attic countryside. Even Ajax the stranger could be brought into connexion with Athens, through the earlier cult at the Eurysakeion. As Ajax reaffirms the Athenian claim to Salamis over Megara, so Pandion and Kekrops can be seen as stressing Athenian primacy over Megara and Boeotia. Although Pandion had a sanctuary on the Athenian acropolis, the Megarians claimed to have his tomb outside their city, and he had another shrine within the walls.45 Elements in the story of Pandion suggest that these facts were explained in such a way as to give Athens the mythological advantage; thus the story that he was banished and fled to Megara where he became the son-in-law and successor of king Pylas.46 According to Hesychius (s.v. év 6' Aiťhna) Kekrops also had Megarian connexions; Athena as the bird ouťhna picked up Kekrops under her wings and took him to Megara. This is probably a careless confusion with Pandion, who according to Pausanias (1.41.6) was buried 'in what is called the cave of Athena Aithyia'. Better attested are Kekrops' Boeotian affinities; Pausanias mentions his heroön at Haliartos (9.33.1). It was presumably these discrepancies which led to the creation, most likely atthidographic, of Kekrops II and Pandion II. But before such rationalisation was attempted, it was obviously advantageous from an Athenian point of view to claim these heroes for Athens. Making them eponyms of considerable portions of the Athenian population was one way of doing this, and it is tempting to conclude that Pandion and Kekrops as eponymoi were, among other things, a dig at Megara and the Boeotian cities.47 The connexions of Akamas cover a wider area. As the son of Theseus, his function, either singly or with his brother Demophon, is to spread the influence of Theseus' kingdom to farflung areas of the Greek world. He has clear connexions with Cyprus, which seem to spring from the place-name Akamas for the area between Paphos and Arsinoé (Strabo 683). 43 The provisions of IG I-* 78, encouraging all Greek cities to bring firstfruits to Eleusis at the Proerosia, are a clear assertion of the primacy of Eleusis in things agricultural. 41 The cull of the herald Leos at Hagnous was certainly old, as it was mentioned in Solon's axones. The connexion with Theseus in his story (Plut. Thes. 13) would fit with a persistent theme among the eponymoi (see n. 38). But since dedications by officials of Leontis have been found at the propylaia (IG 11-1742) and at Dafni (ib. 2818) a location in the town seems more likely than one at Hagnous, and so the eponymos would be the Athenian Leos, as [Dem. I 60.29 assumes. The two may have been identified at some stage. 44 See n. 2. 45 Paus. 1.39.4,41.6. 46 Paus. 1 .39.4. Pandion's son-in-law Tereus also had cult at Megara, ib. 41 .8-9, Strabo 423. 47 Ajax also has an obvious relevance to Megara, via Salamis. Kron, Phytenheroen 30, further supposes that the choice of Hippothon was aimed against the Peloponnesian league, Cleômenes having garrisoned his troops in Eleusis during his invasion of Attica (Hdt. 5.74.2); but this seems somewhat fanciful. More pointed may be the selection of Antiochos, the son of Herakles whose descendants led the return of the Herakleidai (Paus. 2.4.3, etc). At first sight such an archetypally Dorian hero seems odd for Athens, but granted that the Spartan ally of Cleisthenes' enemy Isagoras, king Cleômenes, claimed to be 'not Dorian but Achaean' (Hdt. 5.72.4), is it possible that Antiochos was intended to appeal to the anti-Cleomenes faction in Sparta?</page><page sequence="96">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, II 89 According to Strabo the city of Soloi was founded by the Athenians Phaleros and Akamas, while Plutarch ( Solon 26) states that Philokypros' capital Aipeia, later to become Soloi, was founded by Demophon. Chytroi was also said to have been founded by a grandson of Akamas.48 The Cypriot attachments, however, more probably date from the time of Cimon's campaigns than from the late sixth century. Of more interest in this connexion is Akamas' presence in Thrace and the Chersonese. Homer, to whom Theseus' son Akamas is unknown, mentions a Thracian king Akamas (//. 6.7), and it is presumably from this tradition that the Athenian infiltrates the area. The story is first attested in Aeschines (2.31); in its fuller form it is as follows: when Akamas and Demophon had freed their grandmother Aithra from her Trojan captivity, they returned through Thrace where Phyllis, the daughter of the king of the Bisaltoi, fell in love with Akamas (sometimes Demophon). They were married, and as her dowry she brought him the Ennea-hodoi area.49 This, of course, was the part of Thrace which Peisistratos had first taken an interest in; its gold and silver ores led to increasing Athenian interest in the area, although it was never easy to maintain influence. Another version makes Akamas and Antimachos leaders in cultivating the Chersonese; in itself it is late testimony, but it is most likely to originate from a time when Athenian presence in the Chersonese was topical, that is, at the time of the expedition of the elder Miltiades (whose family retained interests there until 493).50 Since Thrace and the Chersonese were both areas of great Athenian interest in the decades preceding the reforms, it seems likely that quite a lot had been heard of Akamas, and that when he came into greater prominence as eponymos these northern connexions were his primary association. The Aeschines passage demonstrates how Akamas continued to be used to bolster Athenian claims in those areas. Not all the eponymous heroes had such strictly political overtones, of course. That would not have been very subtle, and besides, other aspects of the life of the polis deserved prominence. Oineus is a very shadowy figure, but from his name and one version of his descent ([Dem.] 60 calls him son of Dionysos)51 it is certain that he was originally one of the figures connected with the introduction of the vine into Attica, presumably without the misfortunes of Ikarios or the strong family connexions which seem to belong to Semachos." Similarly Hippothon as an Eleusinian hero will have had or gained some connexion with the beginnings of agriculture. These two, who may possibly not have been among the original ten (above, n. 8), were culture-heroes and nothing more, but the king Kekrops was also credited with many cultural innovations of a more sophisticated sort: the introduction of writing into Attica, the burial of the dead, and, most often, the institution of monogamous marriage.51 Many of the details are no doubt relatively late, but the fact that almost all such innovations are ascribed to Kekrops rather than to any other king must be indicative of his original nature. 411 Steph. Byz. s.v. Xvtpoi, from Alexander Polyhistor and Xenagoras. ** A variant attested in the scholia on the Aeschines passage, makes the marriage occur between Phyllis and Demophon; their sons were Akamas and Amphipolis, the latter of whom can hardly antedate 436. Another version, popular later (e.g. Ovid, Heroides 2) has Demophon abandon Phyllis, who thereupon curses the Athenians; this is surely no earlier than the loss of Amphipolis, explaining the Athenian lack of success in the area. 50 Sc hoi.

These manifold connexions seem to place a question-mark over the tradition that the ten eponymoi were selected by the Pythia from a short-list of a hundred (Arist. Ath. Pol. 21.6). Could the whole hundred have had equally meaningful associations? Apart from the ten winners, the identity of only a few candidates is known (suggesting they retained some special status as a group),57 although even with our fragmentary knowledge of the heroes of Attica it is not difficult to draw up a list of a hundred. Cleisthenes must have had many more at his disposal, and so would presumably have been able to exclude many, making his choice in some way selective. But the final choice of ten looks suspiciously 'significant', even more so if Theseus and Kodros were originally among the eponymoi in place of Oineus and Hippothon. So how did the Pythia choose them? Sortition from a pre-selected list, K^rípcooiç £k KpOKpíxcov, is of course the most characteristic democratic form of appointment to office, and if the eponymoi were selected by anything even approximating to this process we can see the interesting phenomenon of potential heroic patrons undergoing the same democratic procedure as the citizens themselves.58 But the parallel need not be exact; though àveîtev at Ath. Pol. 21.5 certainly implies the use of sortition, this may be based simply on conjecture, and Cleisthenes may in fact have sent along with his list some hints on the criteria to be used in making a selection. Four kings cannot conceivably be due to chance, although whether this predilection for royalty belongs to Cleisthenes or to the Pythia cannot be known. One possibility is that Cleisthenes gave both lists and enquired, according to the oracular formula, whether the choice of ten were 'better and more preferable', kcpov Kai ájaeivov.59 Whatever the detailed criteria and the manner of choice, it is clear from the mythical functions of the eponymoi that there was some method in the selection. These functions are some what we should call 'political', others not; but they can all be seen as directed towards the public good, towards state rather than individual, towards the ordered life of the community. There are no magicians, no healing or oracular heroes among them, to confer benefits erratically on the individual. Their benefits were given in the mythical past, and then became the common property of the people of Attica. 54 Kronos and Rhea: Philoch. FGrH 328 F 97. Other cults: Paus. 8.2.3 (non-animal sacrifice), 1.27.1 (statue of Hermes in Erechtheion), Diod. 5.56 (sacrifice to Athena with fire), Euseb. Praep. Ev. 10.9.22 (naming of Zeus, foundation of first altar, statue of Athena), Chron. 2.24.27 (sacrifice of ox to Zeus). Some of these accounts may be of late origin, or even fabrications; what is noteworthy is the plethora of cults attributed to Kekrops as institutor; he continued to attract them to himself. 55 Ourania: Paus. 1.14.7. Delphinios: Aigeus was credited with the foundation of the court and his house stood upon the spot. Plut. Thes. 12; cf. Pollux 8.1 19, Bekker Anecd. 1.255.

In the system as it was finally established, Araphen and Kephalos could scarcely have been made tribal heroes, of course, as they were or became eponymous heroes of demes. 5X There are limits, of course; heroes are not 'me')ťhivoi. 59 Nilsson, Historia 1 (1958) 243, Kron, Phylenheroen 29-30, argue against Delphic determination.</page><page sequence="98">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, II 91 Hence it is that their mythology appears more important than their cult as a criterion of selection. Nonetheless their cult became a important part of Athenian civic life, although always within contexts in which the tribal organisation was naturally emphasized. The same can usually be said of artistic depictions of the heroes, which are sufficient to demonstrate an interest in this group of ten but generally have a particular tribal reference. Some depictions are not certain; thus for instance the ten male figures on the east frieze of the Parthenon have plausibly been identified as the eponymoi, suitably present in the context of a synoecistic festival of the whole state and suitable too of course if the composition alludes to the battle of Marathon.60 For the rest, three vases belonging to the last quarter of the fifth century can resonàbly be taken as indicating an interest in the more obscure of the eponymous heroes.61 In all three vases, two or more of the eponymoi are grouped together, with no regard for the elaborate chronologies and filiations beloved of the atthidographers. In their capacity as tribal eponyms, these heroes are timeless figures, not characters in an organised mythological-historical past. In a bell-krater by the Dinos painter (pl. 3, ARV2 1153.17) Oineus, whom Pausanias calls the son of Pandion, appears together with him as his contemporary, and Akamas, who should be three generations younger than Pandion, is also present. The coincidence of the three suggests that they are seen in their capacity as eponymoi. Similar is a lekanis of the Meidias painter (pl. 4, ARV2 1314.17) where Pandion and Antiochos are grouped together, apparently in victory celebrations. This could be interpreted as a commemoration of some type of agonistic victory involving persons belonging to Antiochis and Pandionis, perhaps the dithyrambic contest at the Thargelia where tribes regularly competed in pairs.62 This in turn suggests that the Dinos painter's vase should be taken as alluding to members of the tribes represented by their eponymoi, although not here in connexion with the Thargelia.61 Whatever the occasion, the eponymoi act as a focus of interest. Perhaps too stories about them which are now lost were shown: Oineus is saying farewell, apparently to a girl labelled Choiros.64 Finally in another, famous, work of the Meidias painter (pl. 5, ARV2 1313.5) no fewer than four of the ten appear, accompanied by Philoktetes, Demophon and two others of uncertain identification, Klymenos and perhaps Chrysis; they comprise not only the possibly royal Oineus and the certainly royal Akamas, but also Antiochos and Hippothon. They all appear as a group of young warriors, with no distinction between the eponymoi and the others, and the main subjects of the vase, the rape of the Leukippides and the garden of the Hesperides, set them in a context of heroic exploit, perhaps a variant of the voyage of the Argo. This looks like Attic mythological patriotism, inserting local heroes into the roster of a panhellenic expedition. Or perhaps the heroes should 6,1 Eponymoi: the suggestion was first made by A. S.

In any case, the four eponymoi have come into prominence, and can even associate with Herakles, through having been adopted as the eponyms of tribes. 2. The demes The heroes of the demes are in may ways parallel to the tribal eponymoi. Like the tribes, the demes were created at a definite moment, as part of a wider political and administrative reform; but a significant difference was that the newly constituted units had in most cases been prefigured by less formal local groups, so that the old self-appointed village now became the administrative deme. Although in some cases the new local divisions appear to be cutting across old traditions, ńS in many others the deme must have continued most of the practices and narratives of the old village. This greater continuity and spontaneous development is mirrored in the connexion of the heroes with the demes. Strictly as deme heroes, these figures cannot of course be old patrons, yet as local eponymoi they could (and no doubt often do) antedate 508/7. Araphen and Kephalos seem to have been already available to Cleisthenes,66 and a later parallel is provided by the hero Titakos, who is found in Herodotus (9.73), although it is not until well into the Roman period that we find evidence of a deme Titakidai.67 What is clear is that, unlike the tribal eponymoi, the political connexions and official status of the deme heroes were not created centrally, and at a stroke; we are now dealing with a much more complex and varied process than the establishment of heroes to preside over the tribes. In many cases, then, the new deme simply took the name which had come to be applied naturally to the area along with its traditions and characteristics, the place-name having simply undergone a slight semantic shift. Here the factor of a new, artificial creation recedes completely, and the eponymous hero can be as old as one likes. It is thus theoretically possible that the place-name itself is formed from a conspicuous hero-cult in the area, a phenomenon which certainly occurs with divine cults (witness names like Poseidonia, Artemision, and perhaps even Athens itself).6" A possible case would be Hekale, where an obviously old cult including the worship of the heroine Hekal(in)e was the centre of a combined local festival, surely the only noteworthy thing about the small village. 'Hekale' would be the natural way to refer to the place long before the name received official sanction.69 Again, the name Diomeia is undoubtedly formed from the clearly old figure of Diomos, rather than the reverse - but here we should probably introduce a different category. In this case the place-name is not pre- Cleisthenic; the new deme takes its name from its most distinctive cult. Diomeia is a small city deme near the centre which might well have been considered part of Alopeke or Agryle or even Kollytos before the creation of the Cleisthenic demes.7" There follows a third category among those where the hero's name precedes that of the deme, where the apparent connexion is illusory; in this class, the deme is named from a genos which itself had a cult of an eponymous hero, and the hero is not a true eponym to the deme. The obvious example is Boutadai, with 65 See D. M. Lewis, Historia 12 (1963), esp. 30-6. 66 See above, p. 90 n. 57. 67 Traill 122 (app. C no. 42). 68 But see contra, Burkert GR III.2.4. The point is still contested by Loraux, Enfants 60-1. w Deubner 217; but contra, Pfeiffer, Callimachus I p. 228. 70 In this category should probably be placed some of the demes with 'patronymic' endings. Toepffer (315-6) assumed that these (as Boutadai) were somehow connected with genē of the same names. But some have certainly a heroic origin, such as Daidalidai, a deme adjoining Alopeke, where we know there was a Daidaleion. Ionidai is probably a similar case; it adjoins Gargettos, and Gargettos in one tradition was the father of Ion (Paus. 6.22.7). These names are obviously artificial creations.</page><page sequence="100">THEHEROANDTHESMALLERGROUP.il 93 which Boutes, worshipped on the Acropolis, has no connexion. Semachidai, discussed below, may be another example. The other possible relationships all involve cases where the place- name precedes that of the hero. In the fourth category, then, we could place the hero who comes to be considered the local archegetes (whom we find still nameless at Rhamnous), and so acquires a personalised form of the place-name. This may be the commonest occurrence. The Attic place-name Aphidna, for instance, is also attested in Sparta, and so can scarcely derive from the hero Aphidnos - who is, however, certainly an old figure (below). Heroes closely attached to divine cults, such as Erchios and Phlyos, may often belong in this category. The process would be roughly similar whether pre- or post-Cleisthenic. The final category must comprise those cases where a hero is 'deliberately' created to be an eponym for the deme; this process suggests that a number of demes had already been supplied with their archegetai by other means. This type cannot now be readily distinguished from the last, although it may well have been a largish group. In some cases, the hero is introduced merely as a learned conjecture for the deme's etymology: cenò AeipáSou xivoç - |iiļnoxe 8' ànò zov Âxapvetoç fļ napayaxyn.71 No cult may then be involved, nor any 'real' existence. Since examples from most of these categories appear fairly easily, the deme heroes appear to be something of a mixed bag. They arise in response to such different circumstances that one begins to wonder whether they do in fact fulfil similar functions. Even cult was not, it seems, a necessity; actual evidence for cult of the deme hero, eponym or archegete, is confined to (at most) eleven cases,72 and although this is hardly likely to represent the whole picture, it is very probably the case that, as with the genos heroes, the importance of cult might vary. On the other hand, where cult did occur, it is not always clear how firmly this type of hero was differentiated from other heroes worshipped in the deme.71 Yet they did have enough in common to suggest their scholarly treatment as a unity. Part of the third book of Philochorus' Atthis was devoted to the local history of the demes, including the origins of their names, very often derived (rightly or wrongly) from heroes. We can see that a fair amount of our information derives directly from this source, and it is likely enough that it is the ultimate origin of much more. Another source probably quarried by the later writers of antiquity was Polemon, who wrote a 'description of the eponyms of demes and tribes' (àvapoMpii tčov ¿7t(ovú|Kov T&amp;v 8fjļi(ov Kai (puX&amp;v), to which Preller assigns a whole book of the description of Attica; and, probably to a lesser extent, Diodorus the Periegete, who seems to have paid rather less attention to etymologies.74 From the surviving fragments of Philochorus, we can surmise that he attempted to give an etymology for each deme, which usually involved referring to a hero. The simple derivation of a place-name from a hero is one of the commonest types of etymology throughout the topographical writers of antiquity; nothing proves that an eponym merely mentioned by Philochorus was genuinely worshipped as a hero, or even thought of as a historical figure by his demesmen. Ancient etymologies are most often simply conjectures, and there is little concept of verifying then by linguistic or historical methods; this is often beside 71 Steph. Byz. s.w. 72 Collected in Whitehead, Demes 210-11. However, it seems doubtful whether the maleficent Anagyros can have played the role of deme hero, at least in the early period, and even whether he received regular cult offerings: see above, pp. 12-13. n Sometimes it is clear that the eponymous hero was in a special position, as at Thorikos (below, pp. 98-9): on the other hand, which if any of the nameless heroes at Marathon or Erchia should be regarded as 'Marathos' or 'Erchios' is far from clear from the calendars. 74 Harpocration quotes five etymologies from Philochorus and only one from Diodorus. despite citing the latter under twenty-nine demes and the former under only eight.</page><page sequence="101">94 THE HEROES OF ATTICA the point." Heroes may be intoduced simply as guesses in dealing with place-names. Sometimes, however, Philochorus uses other types of etymology, as when he derives the two demes named Oion from their isolated position (F 29); and presumably the Alopeke story would involve a fox (àXcorcr|Ç: F 24). This would seem at first to be negative evidence showing that no eponymous hero existed, but even here no absolute certainty is possible. If we can trust Harpocration, Philochorus derived the name Kepa|ieíç 'àrcò xf1ç Kepa|incf1ç xé^vriç Kai xoû ťhieiv Kepá^cp xivi iļpan'.7* Admittedly here the two possible explanations are not incompatible - Ķeramos (a real figure in the most complete sense, since cult is mentioned) could be simply the potters' special hero and hence the local hero already before the Cleisthenic deme was constituted. It would be more difficult to reconcile an eponymous hero with Philochorus' etymologies for Oion and Alopeke. But there are other, more haphazard, examples of alternative etymologies given together: for instance Stephanus of Byzantium, who does not state his source, on the deme Pithos: K£icA.r|xai Se àrcò xivoç níťkn), xčov rcíťkov aúxóťh Yivo|xévo)v.77 Speculation seems to be running rife here.78 But the fact that scholars could use what we would call alternative explanations in conjunction with one another strongly suggests that ordinary people would not have found a difficulty either. If, say, the name Korydallos was supposed to be derived from the larks (KopvôaXXíôeç) in the vicinity, this would not be a stumbling-block to the worship of a hero Korydallos (of whom there is in fact no trace). This would greatly facilitate the cult of the deme hero. But what stage do Philochorus and the others mark in the evolution of the deme's eponym? Are their etymologies their own speculation or genuine tradition? No certainty can be possible in individual cases, but the Aristotelian tradition attests a general belief that demes were named 'from their founders' ( Ath . Pol. 21.5) and thus suggests the existence of a good number of deme eponyms. Further, the number of pre-atthidographic deme heroes is large enough to show that the process had begun long before books were written on the subject. We have fifth- century or earlier evidence for ten, perhaps eleven, heroes connected with deme names (the fourth century brings in another two), of varying value and significance, which, however, taken together add up to form some sort of picture. In addition, where cult is found there is a reasonable likelihood that the heroic tradition is of a respectable antiquity; this criterion would give us a further six or perhaps seven. 7g Fifth-century cult for Ikarios is directly attested in IG I3 253 (lines 6, 9), where the hero is the possessor of a considerable amount of money. The other nine appear in literature and art. Phaleros and Melite80 are both in the Hesiodic poems ( Aspis 180; Catalogue of Women fr. 225 M-W), and the otherwise shadowy Eleusis, playing the part of Keleos as Demeter's host, in Panyassis (fr. 24 Kinkel).81 The hero Marathon was depicted on the Stoa Poikile fresco of the battle;"2 as Marathos his death in battle to ensure 75 On Philochorus' use of etymology see Jacoby, FGrH IIIB Suppl. 233-4. 76 'From the craft of pottery and from the sacrifice to a hero Ķeramos.' 77 'It is called from some Pithos [clearly intended as a proper name], storage-jars ( pilhoi ) being present there.' 78 In a different context, we might remark that Pausanias can derive the alternative forms Phigaleia and Phialeia, referring to the same town, from two heroes, Phigalos and Phialos, saying: [OíyaXoç] tiļ JtóXei xò ë£, àpxfjç é-ycvexo oiiacrníç ... nexeßatev àvà xpóvov ànò &lt;tnáXo') BodkoXícúvoç xò ovovia f| tcóA.iç (8.39.2: '[Phigalos] was the city's original founder ... after a while the city changed its name, deriving it from Phialos son of Boukolion.'). 7'' Diomos, Hekale, Thorikos, Ķeramos, Lakios, the archegete of Rhamnous, and perhaps Anagyros; see Appendix I and Whitehead, Demes 210-11. 80 Melite, it is true, is a common name for nymphs and heroines. RE counts seven, one of whom is the Melite of ARV 2 1 268. 1 . But the Melite of the Aspis is the daughter of the Athenian Myrmex (below, p. 99). 81 See on this tradition V. J. Matthews, Panyassis of HaUkamassos (Leiden 1974) 1 15-9. 82 Paus. 1.15.3, 32.4; see above, p. 45.</page><page sequence="102">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, II 95 victory is a mythic prototype of the death of those killed at Marathon, and so this part of the story may well date from soon after the battle. Teithras also is attested in art (as is Phaleros), this time on a late fifth-century lekythos by Aison ( ARV2 1 174-5), fighting the Amazons with Theseus. Two other heroes, Aphidnos and Kolonos, are mentioned by dramatists (E. ap. Phot. s.v. à(ir|Topoç (Reitzenstein 91), S. OC 59-60, 65). It is just possible that Sophocles is modelling the àpxtiyóç of his deme on other deme-heroes, although the emphatic and unexpected úeóç is perhaps against this; but the earth-born Aphidnos should be an old figure.83 The final two of the ten, Dekelos and Kephalos, are attested by historians (Hdt. 9.73: Pherecydes FGrH 3 F 34), but since they may also be regarded as the eponyms of genē they present a slightly more complicated picture. Toepffer assumed without question that Dekelos was the hero of the genos and not the deme, but we may now perhaps be able to reject such a rigid distinction.84 The Dekeleieis may well have been a largish village community based mainly on kinship, not a rigid and exclusive group bound by (largely ficititious) ties of consanguineity but dependent on descent. Dekelos can then be the local archegetes, and so roughly eponym to the village - though changing concepts of local organisation would tend eventually to dissociate deme and genos, and so create some confusion. With Kephalos, evidently an important figure, the problem is different, for the genos of the Kephalidai is associated not with the deme Kephale in the south-east, but rather with the Pythion at Aigaleos (Dafni), on the way to Eleusis. However, cult is attested only in the south-eastern area, and the Kephalidai are probably irrelevant to this.85 It was more likely the south-eastern Kephalos, not the genos eponym, who was among the hundred names submitted by Cleisthenes to the Pythia, from which the ten tribal eponymoi were chosen (above, p. 90 and n. 57). According to tradition, among these heroes was also Araphen, who cannot but be connected with the deme of the same name; even if our sources do not reflect a real late sixth-century list, Kephalos and Araphen must have appeared to have very respectably old origins. Even apart from the early testimonia, then, some of our eleven heroes have features about them which suggest antiquity. Cult outside (but near) the eponymous deme, such as that attested for Kephalos at Thorikos, would certainly provide very strong evidence for the antiquity of the figure in question. Unfortunately there is not much evidence of this type; the closest parallel for Kephalos is Hekale. We are told by Philochorus that the neighbouring demes participated in a festival of Hekale and Zeus.86 This is obviously an old local custom, a central festival uniting neighbouring areas as did some of the festivals of groups like the Tetrapolis or the Tetrakomoi. Furthermore, the circumstantial evidence in Philochorus is such as to leave us in no doubt of the ancient and hence properly inexplicable nature of the cult. 'EkoiXívtí and 'Eicóteioç Zeúç are not recent formations. Still in the north-east of Attica, Oinoe may furnish another example, though less clear. No cult is attested for her either in the eponymous deme or elsewhere, but the appearance of two young men said to be her brothers on the base of the statue of Nemesis at Rhamnous (Paus. 1.33.8) indicates at least a more 83 The hero's autochthonous nature is also attested in Steph. Byz. s.v. À&lt;piôva. 84 Toepffer 189-90; but see above, p. 65. 85 There is no evidence for a cult of Kephalos connected with the Pythion at Aigaleos, which his descendants were said to have founded (Paus. 1.37.6-7) and where presumably the Kephalidai supplied the priest. Tradition made him an inhabitant of Thorikos (Apollod. 2.4.7, Ant. Lib. 41), and it is there that we find him worshipped (16-7. Boedromion) together with Prokris, Thorikos and the 'heroines of Thorikos'. There is then obviously a connexion with the neighbouring deme of Kephale, and the fact that the hero's cult is not confined to the eponymous deme would seem to suggest pre-Cleisthenic cult in the area; also indicative is the fact that Thorikos was one of Kekrops' twelve cities (Strabo 397) which suggests old, strong and separate traditions. (It was also the town in Attica where Demeter landed: H. Hymn. D. 126.) 86 FGrH 328 F 109 = Plut. The. s. 14.</page><page sequence="103">96 THE HEROES OF ATTICA substantial reality than we might otherwise have guessed, and possibly some sort of cult - perhaps obsolete in Pausanias' day - occurring in parts of the north-east.87 Prominent among the stories which give some of these deme eponyms a greater reality are traditions which connect a significant number of them with Theseus. A high proportion of these heroes have already been shown to be pre-atthidographic: Aphidnos, Dekelos, Marathon, Phaleros and Teithras. The Thesean heroes divide fairly easily into two groups, of which the first centres on the north-east and is largely related to the story of the abduction of Helen. Aphidnos kept Helen at Aphidna and wounded Castor when he tried to recover her, but the others were opposed to Theseus. Dekelos protected Helen from him, while Marathos fought in the army of her brothers the Tyndaridai and offered his death for their victory.** If Theseus represents the synoecism and more especially (in some sense) the Cleisthenic re-constitution of Attica, these local heroes are clearly far from giving such aims their blessing; but the group is also largely composed of old figures who have grown up naturally, and reinforces our view of an original north-eastern tradition of Theseus.*9 The second group, formed by Phaleros, Teithras and Thrious, is quite different; they appear as subordinate heroes fighting for Theseus in his various exploits. Here the local hero's deeds become attached not so much to a local saga as to a major mythical figure. The connexion of Phaleros - though it must be borne in mind that here he may not be an Attic figure at all - with Theseus is already present in the Aspis (180) where, in the middle of a quite non- Attic list of those who fought with Theseus in the battle of Lapiths and Centaurs appears Phaleros, which may well be before Theseus acquires new political importance in Athens.1*1 He does not again appear until the late fifth century, on two vases, once in company with Akamas, the son of Theseus (Par. 380.5), 91 and once fighting with Theseus against the Amazons, this time in company with Teithras ( ARV2 1 174-5). For Thrious, as well the hero of 'the Thriasian plain' as of 'the deme Thria', there is no early evidence, only the statement in Stephanus of Byzantium that he was sent by Theseus as an ally of Herakles and became the eponym of Thrious in Achaia or Elis. His Athenian nationality vouched for in this source suggests a connexion with the Attic Thria near Eleusis, and the connexion with Theseus seems to indicate a pre-atthidographic date when the Theseus saga was still in the process of crystallising. Deme-heroes are far from unique in being attached to Theseus; in the following chapter we shall examine other minor heroes who somehow acquire Thesean connexions. In most of these *7 Though perhaps against this is the fact that Rhamnous is not like Oinoe part of the original Tetrapolis, but is joined with Oinoe, Marathon and Trikorythos in a Cleisthenic trittys; its pre-Cleisthenic traditions might be expected to be quite different from those of its neighbours. ** Aphidnos: Polemon fr. X Preller (= schol. //. 3.242). Dekelos: Hdt. 9.73. Marathos: Plut. Thes. 32, from Dikaiarchos. In addition another local hero, Titakos, eponym of a genos Titakidai (the deme of the same name is much later), betrayed Helen's whereabouts to her brothers (Hdt. loc. cit.). See further below, pp. 1 18-9. *9 Among the north-eastern heroes with a Thesean connexion we must count also Hekale, though the status of her connexion is less clear. It may be old, but the pattern of Hekale and Hekaleios Zeus is much more coherent without the presence of the great hero. Although according to Callimachus it was Theseus who founded the cult of Zeus Hekaleios (fr. 230 Pf.), Hesychius may preserve an older version in glossing 'EicáXeioç Zeúç with öv 'Ekó't1 iSpúoato. Jacoby (IIIB Supp. p. 436, on Philochorus F 109) is of course right to point out that the story as it is told in Philochorus involves a journey from Athens, and hence in its developed form, at least, does not relate to the original north-eastern Theseus. 90 Phaleros is certainly more than just the eponymous hero of the Attic harbour and deme. He has fairly clear Thessalian connexions, founding Gyrton in Thessaly (Orph. Arg. 144-5) and perhaps Phaleron at Oita. Indeed, it is more probably a Thessalian Phaleros who is alluded to in the Hesiodic poem, although the coincidence with Theseus is remarkable. 91 Akamas and Phaleros are probably worshipped together at Phaleron (above, p. 40) and together they colonised Soloi in Cyprus (Strabo 683), which may be the incident referred to on the late fifth-century pelike which is our earliest Attic evidence for Phaleros.</page><page sequence="104">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, II 97 cases we can detect somewhere in the process the urge to link the minor, locally significant hero with the universally important name, to gain a wider recognition for the familiar and to explain it in terms of new trends. Phaleros, Teithras and Thrious take their place within this structure. Once a self-awareness on the part of the deme had gained ground it would be very natural for each deme to find a connexion between its own history and that of Theseus. It would be tempting to connect these alliances with the increased popularity and significance of Theseus at the end of the sixth century, especially as the date of the creation of the Cleisthenic demes coincides with this period of interest. The hero of each local area would be brought into connexion with Theseus the synoecist, not indeed through any co-ordinated plan (it is hard to see how that could work), but through the enthusiasm of the local communities for their status as a part of Attica. This would give us a very early date for the significance of the deme-hero. But hard evidence is lacking. The importance of Theseus did not end with Cleisthenes, and factors other than the synoecism may be relevant. Some at least of these alliances could have been forged over the course of the fifth century or even later. Indeed, if the two vases we have mentioned are to be connected with any wider phenomenon, we could as plausibly date the interest as contemporary and compare the more certain interest in the tribal eponymoi, appearing at roughly the same time. At this level, and at this stage, we would simply have an interest in the more recondite local heroes, probably because of their closeness and immediacy, which became fashionable at this time, for whatever reason. Once the trend becomes est- ablished, it is likely enough that a painter might depict the hero of his own deme (as Sophocles writes about Kolonos) or that of his patron. And what better company for the hero - again Sophocles is relevant - than Theseus? Theseus is still a key figure in the drama of the last thirty years of the century, after all - long after Peisistratus and Cleisthenes. But the alliance with Theseus is obviously not incompatible with a pre-Cleisthenic origin, and in some cases this appears to be demanded. All except one of these heroes are demonstrably in existence well before systematic books were written on the subject, which increases the likelihood that the last, Thrious, was also a real hero before Philochorus and Demon wrote. There are then enough deme-heroes who have clearly emerged and taken shape by the fifth century to make it clear that we are very unlikely to be dealing with an isolated and sporadic phenomenon. If our evidence were fuller, we would probably find many other deme-heroes in this period. We must now ask in what relation they stood to the deme, its cults and its administration. First, we may examine the integration of the cult of the eponym, where such occurs, with other cults important in the deme. If the cult were purely a formality, it would surely remain isolated and separate from 'genuine' cults. Yet when, as often, the reverse proves true, the picture is not quite so simple; these heroes may appear in a different capacity from that of deme eponym. Several of them, like so many other heroes, have strong associations with some divine circle of worship. Most widespread is the type where the hero is institutor of a cult, the first priest or the host of a god; it may indicate antiquity, or it may on other occasions represent an attempt to provide an old divine cult with a foundation legend and to place the eponym firmly in the context of his deme and its history. One has only to think of 'Amynos, Asklepios and Dexion' to realise that this type was a living formation comparatively late. Consequently, the deme heroes of this type include figures of different stages of antiquity. Diomos is an obvious example of an old hero; he is not actually attested until a third-century inscription, but Aristophanes mentions the 'HpáicXeia xàv Aio|ieíoiç {Ran. 651), and the Diomos myth, in which the boy, son of Herakles' host and loved by him, becomes the institutor of a new divine cult of Herakles, is so obviously basic to the traditions of the Kynosarges</page><page sequence="105">98 THE HEROES OF ATTICA temple that we must assume his cult is old there.92 On the other hand, there is no evidence for a connected cult of Diomos' father, Kollytos, who may be just an attempt to extend the story to account for the name of a neighbouring deme. Again Hekale is clearly an old figure linked with the cult of Zeus Hekaleios, perhaps its founder (see n. 89). Similar are the hosts of Dionysos, Ikarios and Semachos, although it is not clear that Semachos is really eponymous to the deme Semachidai in north-eastern Attica; a Semacheion is attested in the Laureion area, and it seems perhaps unlikely that a comparatively obscure hero would have cult in two such diverse places.93 But there is a more general difficulty in all these cases, for the connexion of these heroes with major local cults may be very basic to their (pre-Cleisthenic) natures, or else their integration with such cults may indicate only their general importance, and nothing about their status specifically as deme-heroes. More suggestive, perhaps, is the case of Phlyos, who stands in a close relation to the Lykomid mysteries of Phlya; he is a child of Earth, chief goddess of these mysteries. As an institutor-figure he competes with Lykos, neither being demonstrably older than the fourth century. But it is possible that Phlyos' status as deme-hero is primary, and that his integration into the deme's main worship was a consequence precisely of this - deme- hero competing with genos-hero, perhaps. The analogous hero Eleusis, son of the mysterious Eleusinian figure Daeira, is perhaps a clearer example.94 In several versions he takes the place of the better-established Keleos in the myth, and would appear to be a variant substituted as eponym of the deme, in conformity with an already growing fashion. This process was already at work in the mid fifth century, for as we have seen Apollodorus gives Panyassis as his source for this version. Yet it can hardly be original; what we are seeing is a deliberate attempt to incorporate the deme's eponym into its myths. Here too we might also detect an assertion of the claims of the deme, of all the local people, over against a genos, for the daughters of Keleos represent the priestess of Demeter and her assistants.95 Whether Eleusis or Eleusinos gained enough concrete identity to receive cult is uncertain.96 92 IG II- 1247, mentioning a festival of Herakles in which the priest of Diomos takes part. Like II2 1245-6, this is a decree of the group known as Mesogeioi. (On this group see Schlaifer, CPh 39 (1944) 22-7; Lewis, Historia 12 (1963) 34 n. 112; Dow and Gill, AJA 69 (1965) 112-4.) These inscriptions were all found at Bate, near the Acharnian gate, and were to stand ëv T(p i£p(p. But all our literary evidence connects Diomos with the Herakleion at Kynosarges - in the deme Diomeia, quite a different area. Rather than supposing there were two separate cults of Diomos, we may look for the answer to this puzzle in the 7CO|i7tTļ of the inscriptions. This festival involved two sanctuaries of Herakles, linked by a procession: Diomos then remains firmly at Kynosarges. It is stressed in the foundation-story that Herakles is worshipped as a god; this is the innovation ascribed to Diomos. The erotic element in the story may be secondary. 1,3 Semachos a host of Dionysos: Steph. Byz. s.v. Irļļua^iSai, Euseb. Chron. 30. The words of Stephanus (ót(pł 0)v aí íépeiai oarcoi)) make it almost certain that there was a genos Semachidai having the rights to a priesthood of Dionysos. Consequently the deme Semachidai may rather have been named from lands possessed by the genos. The case of Boutes and Boutadai is the obvious parallel; the hero was worshipped on the acropolis, where the Eteoboutadai provided his priest, while the deme Boutadai is north-west of the city, near Lakiadai. The status of Ikarios depends on the reading in the deme accounts of Ikaria, IG I-* 252. If the reading there adopted for the second deity, 'licapio, is correct, as it almost certainly is, Ikarios is clearly a major figure in his own deme, comparable to Dionysos. Again his status may be largely due to his significance in the divine cult, rather than to his position as eponym. Another possible candidate for this group is Erchios, who according to Stephanus of Byzantium gave hospitality to Demeter. This surely ought to mean that he founded her cult in the deme. It is perhaps a problem that not only does Erchios not appear (at least by name) in the Erchia calendar, but neither does a local cult of Demeter. But since the scope of the calendar is controversial, we cannot draw any conclusions from this. 94 Paus. 1.38.7. 95 Paus. 1.38.3. 96 Unlike Keleos, Eleusis does not appear among the Eleusinian heroes in the Nikomachos calendar (lines 65-74). The festival of course takes place in Athens, but the sacrifice is performed by the Eumolpidai, and many other Eleusinian figures are involved. The list may have been influenced by the Homeric Hymn to Demeter , lines 153-5; see Körte, Giotta 25 (1936) 137. It seems, incidentally, that according to the hymn, Keleos is the son of</page><page sequence="106">THE HERO AND THE SMALLER GROUP, II 99 Elsewhere the deme eponym may appear in company not with gods but with other heroes, a pattern perhaps less likely to be old and somewhat more suggestive of a more or less deliberate integration. Cult of the eponymos is demonstrated in an interesting way by the Thorikos calendar. From the entry in Hesychius which is our only literary source for the hero Thorikos97 we might suppose that this figure was merely a conjectural explanation for the place-name, but the calendar shows that he was conspicuous in the deme's cults in the fourth (or late fifth?) century, unlike the other heroes receiving two or possibly three annual sacrifices. But like heroes in the deme, Hyperpedios and Pylochos, he is followed by nameless heroines who receive a table-offering when the hero receives sacrifice. In one of his appearances he is grouped together with Kephalos and Prokris, again local figures. It is impossible to be certain how old a figure Thorikos is, but whatever his origins, he is clearly real enough by the end of the fourth century. Integration into other cults and myths of the area is obviously crucial. We could compare Melite; no cult is attested for this heroine, but it woud be unwise to assume that none therefore existed. Melite was the mistress of Herakles (the Alexikakos whose shrine stood in the eponymous deme)911 and therefore probably the mother of some local hero, 'for the beds of the immortals do not fail to bear fruit'.99 She was also, as early as the Catalogue of Women (fr. 225 M-W), the daughter of Myrmex, eponym of the Múp|ir|Koç àxpcwcóç in nearby Skambonidai, and it can hardly be coincidence that Myrmex was the son of Melanippos, whose shrine was also in Melite.100 Another famous heroön of the deme was the Eurysakeion, and although we know of no myth linking Melite with the Salaminian heroes, we have a vase showing her in company with Ajax (pl. 6A, ARV2 1268.1) - an allusion to an unknown myth, or a figurative means of showing the deme connexion? In either case the connexion of Melite with other figures of the deme was already being stressed quite early. There is no particular reason to suppose that the integration exhibited in these last two cases was unusual, but when we turn from the deme's religious framework to its more secular affairs, the picture seems more negative. The organisation of tribal matters - meetings, decrees, publication of notices - was all more or less conducted in a context relevant to the tribal hero, occurring at his shrine and often including sacrifice to him. This was natural enough in practical terms: a tribe, whose members were drawn from all over Attica, would need some specifically arranged place in which to assemble. The deme's identity, on the other hand, naturally expressed itself more clearly in spatial terms. It covered a certain area of territory, and even those demesmen who lived outside that area would accept that place as their deme, necessary to their identity as Athenian citizens, to which they would have to travel if they needed to take part in deme affairs.101 There was then less need to create a fixed and artificial administrative centre, and so the eponymous hero, whose sanctuary, on the tribal analogy, might have been expected to fulfil this role, had perhaps less opportunity to become integrated into deme politics and to express deme identity. The deme's assemblies, which would perhaps Eleusinos (line 105). It is possible that the figure called ÀpXTlTETTjç in the sacrifice list (line 67) is to be identified with Eleusis. But Oliver (Hesp. 4 (1935) 27) takes this to be Iacchos, who is given this title in Strabo (468). 97 Labarbe ( Thorikos , p. 15 test. 12) suggests that the (bvoļjotodrļ Ôè arcò ©opiKOir Kúrcpioi of Hesychius (s.v. ©opiKÓç) may conceal a reference to the Cypria , which would give the hero a less shadowy existence. There were other references to Attic myths in this poem; see below, p. 105. 98 On Melite and Herakles, see Wilamowitz, Hermes 22 (1887) 126 n. 1 . 99 Od. 1 1.249: true, with a very few exceptions; for instance Apemosyne and Hermes on Rhodes (Apollod. 3.2.1). 100 Photius s.v.

Possibly the agora might contain the shrine of the deme's archegetes - it would be a natural enough place for a tomb of civic significance - and, we might speculate, in some cases the demarch might perhaps open the proceedings with a sacrifice to thē founding hero. But these are only wild guesses, with no firm evidence, and in any case a hero with a small shrine in the agora can hardly have occupied the same central position in the group's consciousness as one around whose sanctuary - large enough to contain its decrees and dedications - the tribe was deliberately assembled. The general contrast is strengthened by the instructions for the placing of deme decrees; 1,12 the most favoured places were the agora (IG II2 1174, 1180, ? 1188), the theatre (1185, 1197, 1198, 1202), which could also of course have many of the functions of an agora, and major sanctuaries. Demes were not consistent in their practice: fourth-century honorary decrees from Eleusis specify the theatre, the Dionysion, the propylaia of Demeter and Kore, perhaps the agora, and, indecisively, oitovi av ôo[k]eî év KaXXífaxJtoi eivai (1 193). But of the hero Eleusis or Eleusinos, no trace. Again, this is quite different from the siting of tribal decrees, which were normally placed in the shrine of the eponymos. The position of the deme hero can never have been a pivotal one like that of his tribal counterpart. 'Secular' business was not, it seems, transacted under his supervision, and in the more purely religious sphere (to make a somewhat anachronistic distinction), though he might be important, he was not of primary importance. Especially where demes remained essentially static local communities, there would normally be other cults to express cohesion and community of worship. These came near to the centre of deme life, and at Myrrhinous, for instance, we find that the sanctuary of Artemis Kolainis occupies a quasi-official place in the workings of the deme, at Cholargos the Pythion; these, surely, are the cults which most distinguish the deme. What then was the significance of the deme hero? The importance of such figures may have been in a sense intellectual, as a kind of explanation. This process is apparent in the speculative use of the hero as etymology: is it possible that in some cases even the more 'real' heroes developed from such speculation? If so, the explanation of the deme's identity in terms of a heroic archegete would be an important part of popular historical perspective. Once the hero was established, the coincidence of name would assume a special significance; given the prevalent ancient view on the significance of names, it seems likely that if a hero shared the deme's name, his link with it would be seen as a peculiarly intimate one. As his name explains the deme's name, so his existence and past exploits in a sense explain the deme and its past, supplying perhaps a fixed and definite point in a web of different, sometimes conflicting traditions. As archegete, the deme hero was capable of answering for the deme the most fundamental question of all - How did the area come into being? 102 1G II" 1 174-1214. A further example is in ApX- AeXx. 25a (1970) 209-10: a decree of the deme Eitea is to stand in the sanctuary of Basile. See also Whitehead.

Neither is the heroine likely to have been named from the deme, since like her sisters she bears a name reminiscent of Ge, Demeter or Kore. (Lousia is an epithet of Demeter in Arcadia, Paus. 8.25.6.

The development of myth and saga, of narrative traditions concerning the hero, is intimately related to this function, while it also involves other factors and continues to a further degree, when biographical elaboration eventually becomes desirable for its own sake. The classic hero, equipped with grave, with regular sacrifices, and with a set of biographical traditions, represents the convergence of the hero of cult with the hero of epic.' Originally these figures performed quite similar functions in different ways. Historical and quasi-historical saga, of a type involving men and women of the past, is a phenomenon which exists in most societies. It gains its point from the implicit relationship of the past to the present; past either contrasts with present or explains it. At a stage anterior to the developed saga, the simplest form of story explaining the present is the religious aition, which explains a contemporary practice by reference to its institution. A practice which seems remarkable, even illogical, is thus set in a past context in which, by contrast, it is the natural, indeed the only, outcome, and the story is not developed to any greater degree than is necessary for this purpose. Civic and political configurations may be explained in the same way. The unity of a group or sub-group may be expressed on the level of cult by shared religious practices, perhaps the worship of a hero; on the level of myth is is expressed either by the notion of a common descent or through the invention of a mythical group dating back to the heroic age and paralleling the present group. Contemporary territorial claims, both among the Greeks and elsewhere, are expressed in terms of the deeds and possessions of one's heroic ancestors. But social groupings and political, circumstances tend to involve more complexities than the actions of religious ritual. So, in Attica, mythical history reflects a number of features which the Athenians saw as important about themselves and their polis, some interlocking, some almost mutually incompatible. Thus Attica is a unity: it was ruled more or less as such by Kekrops or Theseus. It is essentially composed of three or perhaps four parts: it was divided along those lines among the sons of Pandion. These two views must eventually be reconciled by the introduction of some sort of rudimentary chronology, so that Pandion and his sons are living after Kekrops and before Theseus. In this way a larger picture including a sort of time- scale is built up, and gradually a more or less continuous background of mythical history is acquired. A third type of story leads directly to the world of the epic. This is the story which contains an implicit (at times explicit) contrast with the present, where heroes are greater and more privileged that the men of today, and where the main purpose of reporting their actions is to express this superiority - or simply an enjoyment of a world larger than life. Of course aetiological elements may be subsumed among the deeds of these heroes, so that the categories of story cannot be divided along quite hard-and-fast lines. If such 'epic' heroes are also believed to be the ancestors of contemporaries, or otherwise connected with them, it is also true to say that they supply a link between past and present, at the same time as they express a disjunction. 1 The contrasting phrases are Nagy's, in part two of The Best of the Achaeans (Baltimore 1979). 103</page><page sequence="111">104 THE HEROES OF ATTICA All these types of story may exist independently of any heroic cult, and a comparison with other cultures suggests that the heroic story is more widespread than the cult, probably older, and certainly very often of independent origin. It is incorrect to take the cult-hero as primary and to ask why some heroes develop a mythology. Rather, both cult and myth in their different ways explain the present in terms of its relation to the past. The developed hero has usually both cult and myth; before we return to consider the phenomenon of heroes as a whole, we must examine some trends in their mythology. Myths of the Attic heroes often, though not always, relate to some larger whole, whether to panhellenic saga and epic or to patterns of Athenian self-apprehension. Variations on these themes are manifold. 1. The epic and heroes of cult If one of the functions of myth is to establish important truths about the group which nurtures the myth, then it is clear that for any subdivision of Greeks one of the most important facts to establish in this way will be their Greekness. In the well-known words which Herodotus puts into the mouths of the Athenian envoys, as they explain to the Spartans their reasons for refusing to co-operate with Mardonius, the factors which denote 'Greekness' (to 'EAAt|vikóv) are a common descent, common language, and similar ways of worship and other customs (Hdt. 8.144). He might have clarified the concept of a common descent by adding 'a common mythology', for it is through the myths of the heroes that such a notion is established. And although every city had its own local stories and its own variations on more widely diffused myths, the links which unite these local traditions are still much stronger than minor disparities of detail. There is, after all, a conglomerate to which we can give the name Greek mythology. The single most important factor holding these local mythologies together was of course the epic - a much larger body of verse than that to which we now have access, but still dominated in popularity and esteem by the Iliad and Odyssey. Despite the contrast between the world- view, and particularly the eschatology, prevalent in Homer and that of societies for which the great men of the past may still be powerful beings in the present, we can hardly dispute that the epic had at least some direct influence on the way in which heroes were viewed. Indeed a view which commands much acceptance, going back at least to Famell but in recent times perhaps most notably expounded by Coldstream, is that the diffusion of the epic in the eighth century was a major factor in the rise of hero-cult.: This proposition has not gone unchallenged, and it is in fact fairly clear that the Homeric poems themselves show an awareness of the phenomenon of special heroic graves.1 We may still concede, however, an intimate connexion between heroes and epic; the epic is likely to have popularised the cults of individual heroes and helped to develop a clearer idea of who these heroes were and what their deeds had been. The hypothesis of a direct correlation between the epic poems and the cult of heroes applies most easily of course to areas like the Argolid with which the heroes of the Homeric poems were associated. If Agamemnon were known from epic tradition to have ruled in Mycenae or Argos (the distinction is not always made clear) the latter-day inhabitants of the area might well be moved to seek out and venerate his grave. But the Attic heroes do not readily find direct sources in either the Theban or the Trojan cycles; Attica gets very little press in Iliad or Odyssey. Most of such references as exist have been since ancient times subjected to a very suspicious scrutiny, while other passages clearly refer to pre-existing cults rather than providing 2 Farnell 284, 340-2; J.

As for the colourless leader of the Athenian contingents in the Trojan expedition, Menestheus, there is no sign of a cult for him in his native land. Even the one (reasonably) certain case of heroic tombs in Attica linked to a common mythology, the Mycenaean tombs later identified with those of the Seven against Thebes, links only Attic soil, not Attic heroes, with the larger world of Greece. At first sight the epic does not appear to have offered the Athenians much stimulus for the development of heroic cult, nor much scope for bringing their local figures into connexion with a wider world. Attica figures rather more noticeably in the Trojan Cycle apart from Iliad and Odyssey, but 'which came first', epic or local tradition, is far from clear. It may be merely the fragmentary nature of our sources which gives these references somewhat more of the air of insertions of separate, pre-existing traditions than of episodes of a continuous story; but the presumed relatively late date of most of these poems in fact leaves little time in which they might stimulate cult, rather than reflect it.4 The Attic references are various. Kephalos, to us a somewhat Obscure figure known chiefly for the romantic interest surrounding him and his wife Prokris, but clearly once one of the major figures of south-east Attica, figured in the Epigonoi as a famous hunter, and was also known to the author of the Nostoi .5 The sons of Theseus, Akamas and Demophon, who are absent from the Trojan story as told in the Iliad, appear in the Iliupersis freeing their grandmother Aithra from captivity in Troy; they are under the leadership of Menestheus, and so Attic heroes as in later times.6 The Cypria, possibly the latest of all the poems, has several stories of Attic significance. We have seen that its inclusion of both Iphianassa and Iphigeneia among Agamemnon's daughters is probably a rationalising device designed to reconcile literary tradition with a pre-existing cult.7 Again, the depiction in this poem of Helen as daughter of Nemesis may reflect Attic tradition, but can scarcely have stimulated it.8 The same may be said for the story of Helen at Aphidna, also seemingly narrated in the Cypria .9 Looking back at the other poems, it is a priori rather more likely that pre-existing cults of Kephalos and of the sons of Theseus could have been given a boost by these poetic descriptions of the heroes and their deeds. So the poets of the Cycle seem to have had at their disposal a body of more or less disconnected traditional material which they then diffused throughout the Greek-speaking world. Attic heroes thus become more familiar outside Attica, and the heroes thus publicised may have increased in popularity in Attica itself; but there seems to be no case where a great character of epic has actually stimulated cult in Attica, nor anything suggesting an assertion of the importance of Attic heroes in the Greek world as a whole. Must we then conclude that Attica, with its strongly independent traditions, remained aloof from the heroic mythology of the rest of Greece? There is one further possibility, one which still takes the epic as its starting-point, but which proceeds more obliquely. The epic does not pretend to describe everything a hero ever did, and so there is room for an investigation of 'what the heroes did next'. This type of connexion is not of course confined to Attica; almost every part of Greece felt the need to connect local tradition with the panhellenic world of the 4 The evidence for the dates is summarised briefly by J.

Often enough heroes turned up in surprising places, given their epic history; we find Diomedes at Methone in Messenia, as well as in various parts of Italy, Penelope at Mantineia, and so on, all presumably backed up by explanatory stories.1" Alternatively, it might have been the descendants of the epic heroes who made the move. So, among the Attic heroes, we find such familiar names as Orestes, Adrastos, Neleus and Oedipus (unless the presence of the last-named is a Sophoclean invention.) The foreign hero is a recognisable phenomenon with his own morphological traits (above, pp. 49-50); other factors in the process presumably include the desire to forge a link between the cults of one's own area and the heroes of epic, and sometimes perhaps an instinct for tidying up and reconciling, often rather imperfectly, local names and cults with the more usual associations of these names. Occasionally other, political elements creep into the process. The picture is rarely simple, but we can scarcely deny that the epic played a very important part in fixing local tradition. If we now turn to actual examples, we find several odd corners of Attic heroic mythology occupied by epic and sub-epic characters, often very minor figures. The relationship between the literary character and the local figure may be of various kinds. It is not always clear, for instance, just how much the presence of a particular hero in Attica owes to his appearance in Homer or other epic; there will often be some element of a genuinely independent tradition. Leaving aside such cases as those of Phrontis where, as I have already argued (pp. 41-2), the epic is merely reflecting a pre-existing cult, specific examples reveal various possibilities. The commonest type of epic influence would seem to be the case where an old figure of cult comes to be identified with an epic or sub-epic character; such an identification occurs all over Greece in the case of Helen. Attica, or its immediate environs, provides us further with figures such as Amphiaraos or Iphigeneia, where some type of daimonic figure has somehow become merged with an ordinary human character of saga. The dramatic manner of disappearance of both these figures - Iphigeneia sacrificed or all but sacrificed to Artemis, Amphiaraos swallowed up in his chariot by the earth - relates both to epic, in that these things are episodes on a wider canvas of events, and to the ritual of cult. The result might not be entirely harmonious; as we have seen, there are some very strange tensions in the resulting character of Iphigeneia, for instance. However, it does seem that here we can trace some stages in the process, for Iphigeneia the daughter of Theseus and Helen is surely an early Attic version and not a mere fabrication of Stesichorus. First comes the impulse to humanise figures like Iphigeneia and provide them with a genealogy; then, perhaps under pressure of conflicting traditions, the fitting of the heroes into a more cosmopolitan pattern. A similar, but not identical, process is at work with a couple of sailing-heroes at Phaleron, whom we know from both literary and epigraphical sources." These relatively minor characters have minor Odyssean names, Phaiax and - in one version - Nausithoös, which is the name of the father of Alkinoös (Od. 7.56ff). Surely this reflects a sort of passion for the epic - a sailor (the cult was presumably already in existence?) must be a Phaeacian, belonging to the race of the best seamen known to Homer. It is interesting that this naming marks only a first stage in the acquiring of personalities by these two heroes, for it is clearly later that they are tagged onto the entourage of Theseus, becoming his Salaminian navigators, handed over to him by the Salaminian king Skiros. (Indeed, despite the link provided by their names, their pairing is not complete: the epigraphical source still separates the two names with that of Teukros.) Thus they enter a complex world of commemorative festivals and political associations - but despite these quite different connexions they retain their Phaeacian names. 10 Diomedes in Italy: collected evidence in RE V 820-3.

The s. 17.6); Salaminioi decree 91.</page><page sequence="114">HEROIC MYTHOLOGY 107 Presumably the traditions could be reconciled by bringing them to Salamis from the Phaeacian land of Scherie; but the sequence of development is clear, and disturbingly quite the opposite from that of the previous example. Here in the process of identification we get first the world of the epic, and only later the build-up of the local saga. In this case it seems that the arrival of Theseus as a major figure in this part of Attica, attracting minor heroes into his circle, is a relatively late phenomenon. Against the general background of this pattern, more specific motives sometimes come into play. The case of Neleus is an example of political considerations influencing an epic connexion.12 From an inscription dated 418/7 (IG I3 84) we learn of a city shrine commonly called the Neleion, in which were worshipped Kodros, Neleus and Basile, the first-named, who is not mentioned on every occasion, being fairly clearly an afterthought. Basile is a puzzling character, apparently with several facets, but here she is clearly one. half of an old pair of gods, of local significance only; this cult group has then been transformed into something quite different, for the addition of Kodros makes it certain that Neleus was identified with the Neleus or Neileus who in the developed tradition represented by Herodotus (9.47, 97) was the son of king Kodros of Athens and founder of Miletos and other Ionian cities on the coast of Asia Minor. Obviously the purport of this is that Athens is the natural leader of these cities, and since the Attic claim to Ionian primacy was canvassed as early as Solon,13 it is possible that the transformation of Neleus may have had its origin in an identification of the Athenian Neleus with a Milesian hero of the same name. The epic element may then have come in indirectly, via Miletos, where it would be claimed that the local Neleus was a descendant of Neleus of Pylos, Nestor's father. The later Neleids thus leave Messenia for Attica, and from there proceed to colonise the shores of Asia. Attica is a sort of link between the epic past and later, 'historical' events. Although the Messenian element may not have been of primary importance in an Athens whose citizens were proud of their autochthonous origin, the Messenian names quite frequently found in Miletos and related cities do have their Athenian counterpart in names like Peisistratos found among those who claimed Neleid descent. The backward-looking claim, as well as the claim forward to Ionia, become important. Epic ancestry might, however, be used simply to lend dignity to a family; Andócides, we recall, claimed descent from Odysseus, via the rather unlikely combination of Telemachos and Nausikaa,14 and the family of the politician Phaiax could well have thought of Phaeacian ancestors. Here there need be no cult element, and aside from genealogies we find other epic characters appearing in Attic narrative tradition, clearly as genuine introductions and not as identifications of figures from Homer and the Cycle with already existing heroes. Such are the Cyclopes, who make several appearances in Attic contexts;15 these characters, frequently equipped with proper names, do not, it is true, necessarily originate from the Odyssey, but after the wide diffusion of the poem they were impossible to dissociate from it. They add a touch of the exotic, but a touch with strongly epic colouring. Examples of epic mythology could be iterated, and they are not always simple. There may- be direct political motivation for the importation of epic elements, as it would seem in the 12 See J. Barron, 'Milesian Politics and Athenian Piopaganda, c. 460-440 BC' J HS 82 (1962) 1-6. 13 Jtpeaßvr&lt;XTT1V écopwv yaîav 'It|ovítiç, fr. 4a West. 14 Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 24c. 15 We hear of Ktaitioç xoû Aypiómou toû KúkXcotcoç, schol. //. 1 8.483 (see below); Mekávuntoç toû KúicAamoç toû ZevÇíratov), Photius s.v.

It is likely that Agrolas and Hyperbios. apparently the builders of the Pelasgian walls of the Acropolis (Paus. 1 .28.3) were Cyclopes; this is suggested by the tradition of Cyclopean walls, by their names (cf. Od. 9.106-15), and by the Sicilian and Acarnanian connexions (cf. schol. //. 18.483).</page><page sequence="115">108 THE HEROES OF ATTICA transformation of the hero of Melite, equipped with a shield, into Eurysakes, son of Ajax of the oáicoç £')pv&gt; (//. 17. 132). 16 Or the growing complexity of ritual and its explanation might demand a heroic figure as the first performer - and so Orestes, as the archetypally polluted man of epic saga, is introduced into Attic mythology through such rituals of purification as the Choes at the Anthesteria, with which his name is regularly associated.17 But in all these cases it seems clear that the link with the wider world mattered. On the most obvious level - though it is a process still very incomplete in the fifth century - the heroes of Attica should be integrated into the major sagas. They must take part in panhellenic expeditions and perform deeds of valour in company with heroes known throughout the Greek world; they would not prove their worth by remaining isolated from the rest of Greece. (This is a development parallel to the later tendency in the visual arts to group Attic and non-Attic heroes together; see above, p. 91.) Such developments place Attica in its own - naturally meritorious - relation to the heroic world, and so in a sense justify it. Attica shared in the common heroic experience, and so may share in contemporary Greekness; this is the general basis underlying more specific mythological justifications of the present. The genealogical factor perhaps assists in this process by introducing a rudimentary time- scale, thus making the heroes of Attica contemporaries, in their respective generations, of the heroes of other parts of Greece. It is not until a relatively late date that the more isolated figures of Attica, such as the early kings, were given much chronological organisation; time is extremely vague in the myths surrounding them. But the epic knew quite a precise structure of generations, going down to the sons of those who fought at Troy and extending back to the Trojan generation's fathers and grandfathers - the pattern shown in Telemachos' account of his ancestry (Od. 16. 1 18-20). The sons of the generation of Agamemnon's expedition were not such great heroes as their fathers, while the greatest of the heroes - such as Herakles - belonged to the previous generation; Herakles' son Tlepolemos is killed by Sarpedon (//. 5.627ff). The greatest Attic hero Theseus, who is largely an expression of particularly Attic civic qualities, became firmly anchored to Herakles' generation, while his sons, we have seen, fought at Troy. Theseus' monster-slaying exploits not only mimic those of Herakles; he becomes his younger contemporary and kinsman, and stories relate their mutual dealings. Theseus' son deals kindly with those of Herakles, and Attica is linked, rather ambivalently, with the return of the Herakleidai. This story, the subject of Euripides' Heraclidae, contains a number of formative elements, not least, in Euripides' version, the expression of anti-Spartan sentiments. But beyond this and similar specific motives lies the more general desire to provide a definite and determined link between one's own national heroes and the world outside. It is the same national pride which prompts the introduction of references to Athens and Attica into the Homeric poems where none originally existed. Except in instances where obvious political advantage is concerned,18 this is surely not so much deliberate falsification as an inability to imagine that the major poems of the Greek world might not have a place for Attica. Attica must be explained, as it were, by reference to something panhellenic - Homer in the literary field, and outside this, the vast mass of shifting and unstandardised heroic saga. 16 So Ferguson, Hesperia 1 (1938) 15-17. Alan Griffiths (oral communication) is sceptical, pointing out the Greek propensity, not confined to epic or myth, for naming sons after qualities or achievements of their fathers. The name Eurysakes would not then originate with a previously nameless cult at Melite. This point is not necessarily incompatible with Ferguson's supposition. 17 E.g. Phanodemus, FGrH 325 F 1 1. 18 The obvious example occurs in the Catalogue, II. 2.558, which justifies the Athenian claim to Salamis.</page><page sequence="116">HEROIC MYTHOLOGY 109 At this point, as a kind of pendant to this whole group of heroes, we may consider the case of Ion. Ion is not of course strictly an epic figure, and his manner of relating Attica to the rest of the world is almost diametrically opposed to that of the epic hero. Originating at least partly in minor local cults based either near Gargettos or at Potamoi on the east coast,19 Ion is an Attic hero - at least in the version which came to predominate - who forces his way into a wider consciousness, rather than a panhellenic hero claimed for Attica. The most obvious political importance of Ion was of course to claim for Attica the primacy among Ionian Greeks; the first and eponymous Ionian (Ionians in Greek are simply 'Ions', "Icoveç) was an Athenian, the grandson of Erechtheus. As colonists of the Aegean islands and the coast of Asia Minor, Ion and his sons (the eponyms of the four Ionic tribes) overlap functions to some extent with the Neleids; they represent a more confident and self-reliant way of pressing the claim, and one of wider application, too. The main thrust, so to speak, of these figures, would then have been outwards from Athens to other Ionian cities, and we find them occurring in this context in late fifth-century Samos.2" But what of Athens itself - did Ion bring out any aspects of Athenian self-awareness not covered by other heroes? Just as he seems to be an intruder in the genealogy of the Erechtheid kings, so his appearance in cult has something of the air of an afterthought. If Ion really expressed to the Athenians a deep consciousness of being Ionian we might expect him to appear in rituals which also expressed this. Yet the Apatouria, for Herodotus (1.147) the quintessentially Ionian festival, have seemingly no place for Ion; the hero of the festival's aition in Athens is the king Melanthos, a Neleid certainly and so colonist of Ionian cities - but perhaps owing his Neleid identity merely to his appearance in this Ionian festival. It is of course possible, given the incomplete state of our evidence, that Ion had some less central part in the festival and one of later origins; there are some signs that crucial stages in his development were reached only in the fifth century.21 By this date we do, however, find that his finances have state connexions,22 and he could have been interpolated, as it were, into many different celebrations, as for instance he appears in the fourth century in the Herakleia celebrated by the genos of the Salaminioi. The one city festival which we know Ion did have connexions with was, reasonably enough, an Apolline ritual, the Boedromia. According to Philochorus (F 13) this commemorated the help given by Ion to Erechtheus and his army against Eumolpos in the Eleusinian war. This can hardly be the 'real' reason for the festival, since we find Apollo Boedromios and the month of Boedromion in places other than Athens. But it is unlikely to be mere speculation on Philochorus' part. If Ion had come to be connected with the Eleusinian war, then what is being stressed is his alignment with native, true-born Athenian forces against an army with a distinctly foreign tinge (below, pp. 1 14-5.). This would fit in with a picture of Ion which emphasises the purity of his descent and the closeness of his origins to the gods, which perhaps came to be the important thing about this figure to the Athenians themselves.21 For the tradition claims not that Athens is Ionian, but that the Ionian " Ion son of Gargettos, Paus. 6.22.7, cf. neighbouring deme of Ionidai. Tomb at Potamoi, Paus. 1 .3 1 .3. 20 See J. Barron, 'Religious Propaganda of the Delian League', JHS 84 (1964) 35-48. 21 His presentation as son of Apollo is of central importance here; see n. 23. 22 IG I3 383. 147-9. 21 Although as a hero Ion is closely associated with Apollo, it may be that it was only in the course of the later fifth century that he came to be regarded as Apollo's son; there is no unequivocal evidence before Euripides (A. S. Owen, Euripides: Ion (Oxford 1939) ix-xiii). Herodotus calls Ion simply son of Xouthos (7.94. 8.44). a tradition which persists, and which should already be presupposed in the verse of Hesiod (fr. 9 M-W) making Doros. Xouthos and Aiolos sons of Hellen (yet this again places Ion in an anomalous position, as grandson, not son. of Hellen; and there are no 'Xouthian' Greeks). For the contradiction, we could compare the tradition on the divine or human paternity of Theseus.</page><page sequence="117">lio THE HEROES OF ATTICA race is Athenian.24 Any failure on the part of other Ionians, any degeneracy and weakness conventionally ascribed to the race, could safely be put down to the greater remoteness of the Ionians from the founder of the race and his Athenian ancestors. 2. Traditions of an autochthonous people The myths of a Greek polis, we have seen, must reflect its Greekness. But equally the group must use myth to establish the factors which differentiate it from other Greeks, which give it its own separate, distinct, and - naturally - superior identity. Heroes are the protagonists of myth, and reflect wider perspectives of national self- consciousness. They and their stories explain and validate a people's view of itself. In the case of Attica, one of the most important aspects of this self-consciousness was the tradition that its people were autochthonous, sprung from the earth itself. This whole complex has recently been the focus of important studies by Nicole Loraux, who has demonstrated the centrality of the idea to Athenian culture of the fifth and fourth century.25 The view was clearly well- established in the fifth century: Euripides' Praxithea gives it as a reason for a greater patriotic feeling on the part of the Athenians than of other Greeks (a topic echoed in fourth-century oratory), Aristophanes uses ocůtóxdcov with the connotation 'true-born Athenian', and even Thucydides, though he avoids the word aùxóxùtov, accepts without question the indigenous nature of the Athenian.26 This was the established view, and a reason for self-esteem; the claims of other Greeks, such as the Arcadians, to be autochthonous were tacitly ignored, and this native origin was seen as the distinguishing characteristic of the Athenians. The reverse of this positive emphasis was a diminution in the number of heroic myths available. Although even Arcadia had its Pelasgos, its Lykaon, and its Arkas, the figure of the founder, the colonist, or god-descended ancestor, to whose heroic exploits the origins of polis or ethnos may be traced, scarcely occurs in Attica - for Ion expresses something wider, and something on a more conscious level. Neither do the myths of Attica reflect large-scale quasi-historical traditions and conflicts between races such as that expressed in the return of the Herakleidai. Consequently Attica is poor in mythical history of the 'epic' type; wars and expeditions feature little, obviously in a last-ditch attempt to link Attica with the wider Greek mythical world. Almost the only native 'historical' tradition of this sort - an event that seems to demand a specific place in time, whenever that may be - is the war with Eleusis. Other traditions about early Attica exist in an almost timeless world. Kekrops, Erechtheus and Erichthonios, Pandion are cult figures, sacral heroes whose origins lie in the diverse religious practices of the Acropolis. The order of their reigns and their mutual relationships is of no significance - indeed the difficulties in applying chronological criteria to such figures are seen in the somewhat desperate atthidographic hypothesis of a second Pandion and a second Kekrops. Nor do the different types of political organisation in early Attica - the Dodekapolis of Kekrops, the fourfold division under the sons of Pandion, and the synoecism under Theseus (clearly a figure of different origins) - present an obvious historical sequence, although it is one which comes eventually to acquire some coherence. 24 Cf.

But the Athenians' consciousness of their autochthonous nature also received expression in more positive ways, in the figures of heroes who either literally sprang from the earth or have clearly no ancestry, like Kekrops. Most of these heroes are archegetes who in other ways express central Athenian qualities or traditions. Such stories involve a very literal element; the earth itself, Ge, is an important part of the picture. This is seen most clearly in the myth of Erichthonios, whose name, the very earthy one, proclaims his origin, and whose status as the child of Earth is advertised by the numerous fifth-century representations of the 'Birth', in which a female figure, half-emerging from the earth, hands the infant Erichthqnios to Athena.27 These depictions show the child as an ordinary human baby, but the myth of his tendance by the daughters of Kekrops shows that, as a true autochthon, he could take the form of that most chthonic of animals, the snake.2* Aglauros and her sisters, the myth relates, in defiance of Athena's prohibition, stole a glance at the child under their protection and on seeing the snake around him, or else his own snake-shape, threw themselves off the Acropolis in terror. Had the girls been ordinary human creatures with memories, instead of protagonists in an isolated myth, their panic would have been less, for they would have remembered that their own father Kekrops, the 8i(pui1ç or double-natured, was half-man, half-snake. In fifth-century art, the human upper half of Kekrops is regularly joined to large and splendid snaky coils, and despite a few fully human representations, everyone knew how the hero should look; Aristophanes can use his snake-form as the basis of a joke.29 Although the birth or origins of Kekrops is not part of the structure of the myths of the Acropolis, he too is in a sense autochthonous, for he has no parents. Clearly Kekrops and Erichthonios are figures of essentially the same type, and they are equally clearly related to the guardian snake of the Acropolis; they are protective powers, native to the land, with only limited (and unorthodox) Olympian genealogy. Snakes are very commonly seen as protectors, whether of house or of city; a good parallel to the child-snake Erichthonios is formed by the Eleian Sosipolis, who according to Pausanias (6.20.2-5) fulfilled the promise of his name by turning himself at the head of the army from a baby into a snake, so throwing the opposing Arcadian army into confusion and flight.1" This protective function is due partly to the instinctive fear inspired by the snake in the enemy, but partly also to the creature's origins in the earth itself, with which it seems to have a much closer relationship than do other creatures, emerging from holes and caves and tombs and disappearing back into them again. If the snake is so close to the earth it must desire to protect the substance or being which gave and gives it birth and nourishment. The serpent nature, then, can express autochthony, and it can express a belligerent protectiveness; the circle is completed by the rationale of the autochthonous Athenian, who fights for his country because it is literally his mother." If you are not autochthonous you cannot be a true citizen, says Euripides, and Lysias, while praising the dead fallen in battle, that for the Athenians mother and fatherland are the same: aùtôxôoveç ovxeç TTļv aviTTļv ¿kćktt1vto Kai ļiTļTepoc Kai jtatpíôa (2.17). Although of the heroes with suggestions of autochthony in their make-up only Erechtheus (in so far as he can be distinguished from Erichthonios) actually dies fighting for Athens, they all express the internal 27 Brammer-^ 262-3; see pl. 6B.

So at Thebes, the earth produces a harvest not just of men but of warriors. These are heroic paradigms of the behaviour required from citizens. It is clear that in other ways too Kekrops and Erechtheus/Erichthonios are more that just heroic beings who happen to be autochthonous, for they each have some claim to be the city's archegete: Athenians are indifferently Kekropidai or Erechtheidai. But such figures are not confined to Athens itself, for north-east Attica also boasts its autochthons, including Aphidnos and Titakos.12 Again, the autochthonous nature seems to have been literally understood: Aphidnos is addressed as 'son of Earth who has no mother' by a character in Euripides." Aphidnos was the archegete and perhaps the first ancestor of the people of Aphidna; he expresses in individualised form their claim to be descended from the original inhabitants. It is not random heroes who are autochthonous, but those archegetes who in a sense stand for the whole people. Further, in the case of the Athenian heroes it is clear that both figures, or all three if we separate Erechtheus from Erichthonios, have some attributes other than the 'ordinary' heroic ones of dead human beings. Their essential relations are to the cults of the Acropolis, to the protective daimones, to the ťtáXarra or well of salt water, to fissures in the earth, and to the cult of Athena Polias. They exist to express what are seen as the oldest and most essential traditions of Athens and the Athenians, and not, originally, to provide a coherent chronological sequence explaining the development of Athenian culture. Thus when we read that the Panathenaia were introduced under Erichthonios, this should not be taken, with the atthidographic sources, as an indication of chronology, but as a statement placing Erichthonios in the category of hero-institutor, as the first to celebrate this festival, and as subsequently himself celebrated in it.-14 (Similarly, of other kings, Amphiktyon introduces the cult of Dionysos Orthos and the Greater Dionysia, and Pandion is the founder of the Pandia - that is, indeed, his essential function, from which he is named, as though Erichthonios were to be called Panathenaion.) Again, the attribution to Kekrops of the statue of Hermes in the Erechtheion indicates that its presence is seen as essential to Athenian tradition.15 If the divine cults of the Acropolis - the polis, in fact, in the narrower sense of the word - are central to the Athenian sense of identity, then their hero-institutors, as so often, are the prototypes of the Athenians who perform them. And if the Athenians are autochthonous in the figurative sense, being the aboriginal inhabitants of Attica, then their archegetes, in order to express the same thing in mythical terms, were born literally from the earth. If the people of Attica were united in their autochthonous nature, if they were effectively one people, then it was necessary that the theme of unity should loom large in the local self- consciousness; indeed the whole of Attic prehistory could be seen as directed towards an eventual synoecism. At this point a rudimentary chronological element begins to develop. A people's mythical history must define not only its outstanding and definitive characteristics, but also the historical stages by which its constitution as one people came to be expressed in political terms. We have seen that Attic history has no room for the founder-figure, the oikist of the city; here owoiKia|ióç takes the place of oíkio|íóç as the climactic event defining local history. This is not a simple matter, for the developed tradition contains many complicating 12 Titakos: Hdt. 9.73.3. 11 Photius s.v. óqiiíxopoç (Reitzenstein 91 ); 'À (pi ôve faíaç uiè xf)ç à|jr|TOpoç. 14 Cf.

In particular, since Theseus is a relative latecomer on the heroic scene, yet soon becomes credited with effecting the synoecism in its fullest sense, the older tradition of a united Attica has somehow to be modified and accommodated to this version. Kekrops, if not the founder of Athens, is, as we have seen, effectively the fípcoç àp%r|YETr|ç of the Athenians, expressing their character in himself. Tradition agreed that there had been a time before Kekrops, but it was a time before Athena had taken possession of the city named after her; kings earlier than Kekrops are figures from outlying demes, or belong to a vague and shadowy prehistory with little relation to cultic realities; not much agreement could be reached on them. Kekrops himself was an institutor and culture-hero, who invented or brought to Athens most of what a later age considered normative for a civilised, Greek, life (above, p. 89), and as in so much else he was also an innovator with regard to the political organisation of Attica. The tradition found in Philochorus (F 94) and elsewhere in a different version,16 ascribes to Kekrops the creation of an Attic Dodekapolis; the creation, that is, or the denomination, of twelve Attic cities as centres for a dependent surrounding countryside. This has been variously understood as a miniature Ionian Dodekapolis, based on the four Ionic tribes, and thus perhaps a claim to be pre-eminently Ionian, or as a reflex of some pre- Cleisthenic or even Cleisthenic organisation of the state, or mirroring the introduction of cults from these particular cities into Athens." It is indisputable that the cities given in Strabo's version of Philochorus do correspond to demes and other areas with old and important traditions, and it is conceivable that they were actually old administrative centres, whether on a formal or purely de facto basis. It may be that this organisation represents a convergence of traditions, of these towns as old-established centres and Kekrops as synoecist or similar, a convergence stimulated by the introduction of Theseus as new synoecising figure. Kekrops is represented, in any case, as having the primacy over all Attica, and so as constituting it, in some sense, as a unity. The creation of the Dodekapolis is a unifying move, in contrast to some of the later events. Just as Kekrops was credited with the invention of almost every appurtenance of civilised life, so he also prefigured the eventual unity of Attica. The cultic element, so much stressed by Solders, may be important here as in historical synoecisms; to Kekrops was attributed the introduction of many cults in Athens, almost all of the centrally located cults in fact which had no clear connexion with some other heroic figure, and it is by no means impossible that his name might be associated with such cults in the aaxu as might derive from the local cults of the remaining eleven cities. The important thing is that the Attic archegetes ruled over an Attica essentially united. Erechtheus and the war against Eleusis represent a tradition of a different sort, recording a specific event rather than a condition. Thucydides indeed (2.15) uses it as an example of the disunited state of Attica before Theseus, but it is doubtful whether he knew of further examples. This tradition is certainly not so old as the figure of Erechtheus himself. Erechtheus (as opposed here to the divine child Erichthonios) is an old figure of cult worshipped in conjunction with Athena Polias, and identified by title with Poseidon.*8 His burial on the Acropolis is unlikely to have had much to do originally with the Eleusinian war. The attribution of the war to Erechtheus tells us simply that he was the warrior-king; it is significant that Poseidon, in Attic tradition, appears so often in contexts of strife and hostility.

Erechtheus, with his sacrificial daughters, impersonates the Athenian fighting spirit as Kekrops the civilising spirit. The war which symbolises the former disunity of Attica, and the inevitability of Athenian domination, is naturally attributed to him. For the traditions of what must have been many local wars and skirmishes between the towns of Attica seem to have crystallised into this one war between Athens and Eleusis. The fact that the hostile town was said to be Eleusis was doubtless an embarrassment to the great families of the area, especially the Eumolpidai, who had also to contend with the opinion that their archegete was a Thracian. Whatever the historical basis of the tradition of the war, it is not necessary to suppose that a late date accounts for its preservation; Eleusis, situated beyond the Aigaleos range and half-way to Megara, is less obviously part of Attica than many other towns with old traditions, Thorikos and Brauron for instance.39 Attica might as easily have been bounded at Aigaleos as it might have included the Megarid. Again, Eleusis has a quite disproportionate number of local heroes, not all directly connected with the Mysteries, which suggests strong independent traditions. Eleusinians oppose Athenians in contexts other than the war, as Kerkyon Theseus. In this war, the epitome of hostilities, there are two main views as regards the protagonists on the Eleusinian side. In the version adopted by Euripides, it is Eumolpos who is killed in battle by Erechtheus; according to Pausanias (1.27.4) it is Immarados his son. The chronology is at variance, too; Euripides distinguished two Eumolpoi, and it is the descendant of Erechtheus' opponent (E'i|uoAjtoç Eì&gt;|ióX7io') yey^Ç) who will establish the Mysteries. On Pausanias' view, which seems more natural, the Mysteries already exist: the war is settled on the terms of Eleusinian subjection to the Athenians in everything except this. The chief point at issue in these differing versions appears to be the extent of the Thracian component in the Eleusinian forces. Clearly the double Eumolpos is not original; this duplication is a rather desperate, but not uncommon, expedient for straightening out discordant or unpalatable chronology. Eumolpos in origin is simply the heroic projection of the hierophant, and his name expresses the melodious singing voice desirable in this priest, illustrated on an early fifth-century Mission of Triptolemos ( ARV 2 459.3) by his depiction with a swan. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter (154, 475) he appears among the kings or chieftains of Eleusis; nothing suggests a Thracian origin. But whether or not Erechtheus' antagonist was Thracian by birth, he certainly appears at the head of a Thracian army (in all accounts we know). The name of his son, Immarados or Ismaros, does not seem to be Greek (it occurs in connexion with Thrace in Apollodorus 3.15.4) and the accounts making Immarados rather than Eumolpos the army's leader would appear to be emphasising the Thracian element among the adversaries of Athens. There are two possible reasons for this Thracian connexion. The suggestion that the Thracian Eumolpos was partly due to the numbering of the Eleusinian hero among the Orphic poets is probably right; this is certainly the gist of Attic genealogies which make him son or father of Mousaios, under whose name verses of Orphic tendency circulated.40 We are here dealing with early syncretistic attempts to place together all rites and precepts of a "mystical' nature as essentially teaching the same wisdom. No doubt the ôpco^eva of Eleusis were already capable of an Orphic interpretation, however much violence that might do to their original nature.

One account mentions not only Eumolpos' Thracian army but also an army from Acamania led by Phorbas. Among the dead were Klytios, son of Agriopes the Cyclops.41 Here the specifically Thracian element is subordinated to the bizarre and half-barbarian, the implication being that those who fought against Athens were no true people of Attica, scarcely even Greek. (This was hardly a picture which would commend itself to the Eumolpidai, and it is presumably as a patched-up compromise solution to this problem that the two-Eumolpos theory originates.) From this angle, the tradition emphasizes the threat once posed to Athens by foreign forces. The grave of Immarados was pointed out under the Acropolis, where presumably he had died fighting; one thinks immediately of the graves of those other exotic enemies, the Amazons. An episode relating to the unity of Attica is thus halfway to being transformed into a story of Athenian repulsion of foreign threats; for the war, at least in the form we know, was an Athenian tradition, not an Eleusinian. From the Eleusinian point of view, there was no necessity for the tradition of hositility towards Athens. Such events, if they did occur, were best forgotten, and it is no doubt from the Eleusinian side that we hear contrasting 'integrating' stories, such as that which attributes to the Eleusinian ruler Keleos the institution of free meals at the Athenian prytaneion (Plut. Mor. 667D). As for the heroes of Eleusis involved in the fighting, the mythical function of Eumolpos is to establish the Mysteries, and this is quite sufficient to justify his existence, while Immarados is not an Eleusinian hero at all. It is noteworthy that none of the other numerous Eleusinian heroes seems to take part in this war. In Athens, however, the tradition of a once disunited and rebellious Attica, subdued by the growing strength of its chief city, was of more interest. The repulsion of foreign threats was also a recurring theme in its mythical history. Finally, it is part of the function of Erechtheus to fight wars; he is naturally a fighting hero, as Eumolpos the proto-hierophant is not. The fourfold division of Attica among the sons of Pandion was also, of course, an event, but as with the creation of the Dodekapolis there is more stress on the eventual product than on the act. The importance of the tradition is that it seeks to explain in mythical terms some sort of distinction perceived between different parts of Attica (seen provocatively here as including the Megarid); it is division, then, rather than unity as with Kekrops, which is stressed. This is a mythological device used elsewhere, for the sons of Pandion are closely paralleled in Arcadia by the sons of Arkas. The kingdom of Arkas was at his death divided between his sons Azan, Apheidas and Elatos, which is simply a way of saying that although at the most general level Arcadia is a unity, it is subdivided into three parts.42 But outside this simple structure of father and sons, the Arcadian genealogy has its complicating factors, with the rival early ancestor Lykaon and his progeny. So too in Attica the statement is not quite a simple one. These are not the sons of some obvious proto-Athenian like Kekrops or Erechtheus, but of Pandion, giving the division perhaps a more emphatic, because more unexpected, place in time, and enabling it more easily to be set in a history of changing organisations of Attica. But the original reason for this may lie simply in processes of mythological rationalisation and tidying- up. Omeus, who in what seems to be the oldest version of the story (below) stands in the place of Aigeus, is recorded elsewhere as a son of Erechtheus,41 so that originally it may indeed have been Erechtheus, the warrior-king, whose sons divided the land among themselves.

The earliest explicit reference to the tradition occurs in a fragment of Sophocles ( TGrF F 24), presumably from his Aigeus: ëjnoi jLièv àicxàç ccopioev mxtļp ļio?t£īv&gt; rcpeoßeta veiļiiac; xrjoôe yrjç. . .

Handing oui to me of this land the portion of the eldest, my father decreed that I should go to the coastal parts; then he hands to Lykos the garden which stretches out opposite Euboea; for Nisos he selects the land bordering on the coast of Skiron; and the southern part of the land fell to the lot of this harsh giant-begetter, Pallas. But already we find these figures, with the exception of Aigeus, grouped together with Orneus on a calyx-krater dated shortly before 480 (ARV2 259.1), surely a reference to the same tradition. Despite the relatively late date, this would seem to indicate an earlier version of the story antedating the increased importance which came to be attached to Aigeus following the rise of his son Theseus. But even in this form it still shows an interest in the Megarid, which is allocated to Nisos (clearly a Megarian hero in origin). It is clear that we can further trace the story to an original threefold division of Attica proper, with the Megarid added as a fourth part, one supposes in the sixth century. The idea of a threefold division, as well as producing a closer parallel with the division of Arcadia, has an obvious, if somewhat enigmatic, historical parallel in the parties of Plain, Shore, and Diakria, which were important in political life after the death of Solon. The obvious conclusion would be to identify Orneus (or Aigeus), Pallas and Lykos as mythical prototypes of Lykourgos, Megakles and Peisistratos. Yet even the little we know of the events of these years is sufficient to refute such a simple equation. In Sophocles' version, Aigeus holds in some sense the primacy; but why should Lykourgos? Again, Lykos, as Peisistratos, should not be so conspicuous in the myths of the brothers' quarrels, whether the tradition was finally shaped by Peisistratean or Cleisthenic elements. More telling, perhaps, is the comparison of mythical and historical events at Paliene. In the myth, so told as part of the Theseus story, Theseus (who as Aigeus' son and holder of the 'town' (aax')) should correspond to Lykourgos) starts out from the town and defeats the Pallantidai (Megakles - the Shore) at Paliene. In reality, Paliene was the scene of the battle between the invading Peisistratos (Lykos) and the people of the aoxi) (Omeus / Aigeus / Theseus), in which Peisistratos was victorious. Thus any detailed correspondence has broken down entirely. It might be nearer the truth to suppose that Theseus' victory at Paliene was a sort of post-Peisistratid 'correction' of events; what should have happened, did happen, in an ideal, heroic past, and the seditious invaders were defeated by the legitimate authority. We may compare the defeat of Eurystheus' invading army in the same area, in the next generation - the story of Euripides' Heraclidae. In both cases the parallelism is not exact, merely 44 Praxithea, at least, has no sons in E. Erechtheus fr. 50.22-5, but other traditions persisted alongside this: Orneus, displaced from the group of four brothers, remains Erechtheus' son in Plut. Thes. 32 and elsewhere, while Metion also is very commonly son of Erechtheus (e.g. Pherecydes FGrH 3 F 146).</page><page sequence="124">HEROIC MYTHOLOGY 1 1 7 suggestive. Similarly, the original division in the myth probably corresponds to a distinction of areas perceived at least partly independently of the political squabbles of the sixth century. Certainly any element of deliberate political manipulation of the myth is very minor. Pandion's sons and their quarrels lead us to Theseus and the final mythical unification of Attica. That Theseus was the author of the decisive act which constituted the synoecism seems to have been generally accepted by Athenians of the classical period. Thucydides (2.15) makes it very clear for us what this involved; Theseus abolished the independent magistracies in the demes and established one bouleuterion and one prytaneion for the whole of Attica. Fifth- century authors are almost unanimous in this belief, as in their presentation of Theseus (where he appears) as a strong and benevolent ruler. Yet this Theseus appears to be a relatively recent creation. In the first place, the real importance of Theseus as Attic hero can scarcely be placed before the last quarter of the sixth century; secondly, many of the stories told about him depict an arrogant and wilful man, at odds with many of the local heroes of Attica. Theseus was of course in existence long before his phenomenal popularity on Attic vases indicates a phase of new significance. He appears in the Aspis (182) as the son of Aigeus, fighting against the Centaurs in company with other heroes, though clearly of superior rank. The Hesiodic poems know also of his desertion of Ariadne (fr. 298 M-W). Further, his exploits on Crete and Delos are depicted on the François vase, dated about 570. The early evidence does not suggest a particularly Attic hero, in contrast, for instance, to the picture of Erechtheus which we get in the Catalogue (//. 2.546-51). On the contrary, Hesiod's Theseus would more naturally be Thessalian, while the institution of the crane-dance on Delos suggests at first a genuine pan-Ionian connexion.45 He could also, of course, be located at Troizen, a tradition strong enough to influence the formation of the eventually accepted Attic version. However that may be, it is reasonably clear that at some time in the last quarter of the sixth century there began to be a particular Athenian interest in Theseus. To explain the upsurge in visual depictions of the Theseus saga by the composition and diffusion of a Theseid is only to take the question one stage further back.46 Evidently until this time there had been no need for an illustrious Attic hero of the epic type. Erechtheus and Kekrops, those un-epic, un-episodic heroes, had sufficed as mythological expressions of Athenian self-awareness. To examine in full the reasons for the rise of Theseus would take us far beyond our present scope, which is Theseus the synoecist. But the synoecism is a vital factor. The theory that Theseus as we know him is in a sense the creation of the supporters of Cleisthenes is too well known to need elaboration.47 The chronology and the Alcmaeonid connexions point to this conclusion, but perhaps most significant is the appearance of Theseus as the mythical synoecist, just as in historical times it was Cleisthenes who took the decisive steps towards a functioning Attic unity. Of course, the one-to-one equation of Theseus with Cleisthenes is too simple; Cleisthenes was not bom in Troizen, nor did he fight with monsters and brigands on the road 45 See further H. Herter, 'Theseus der Athener', RhM 88 (1939) 258-62; the whole article, together with the companion piece 'Theseus der Jonier' (RhM 85 (1936) 177-239) forms one of the fullest treatments of Thesean mythology, but is now partly superseded by the same author's piece in RE Supp. XIII. 1045-1238; see also F. Brommer, Theseus (Darmstadt 1982). 46 Aristotle knew of at least one Theseid ( Poetics 145 Ial9ff.). Schol. Pi. 01. 10.83b names Diphilos as author of a Theseid in choliambics; but as West remarks ( lambi el Elegi II 61) this can scarcely be a serious poem if early. 47 See the perhaps over-stated article of K. Schefold, 'Kleisthenes: der Anteil der Kunst an der Gestaltung des jungen attischen Freistaates', Mus. Helv. 3 (1946) 59-63; more recently, C. Sourvinou-Inwood. JHS 91 (1971) 97ff. with bibliography (97 n. 13); J. Boardman. JHS 95 (1975) 2-3. Vidal-Naquet (The Black Hunter (Baltimore 1986) 313) has argued against the generally accepted view linking Theseus with Cleisthenes on the grounds of his clear association with the family of Miltiades and Cimon, but this underestimates the political flexibility of heroes.</page><page sequence="125">1 1 X THE HEROES OF ATTICA from Megara. If there were correspondences (such as we seem to find between Theseus and Cimon4X) between the two figures other than a general type of political activity, it does not seem that we can now recover them. One may ask, therefore, why it was necessary that the synoecism be attributed to a relative newcomer to the Athenian mythological scene. Why could not the Dodekapolis of Kekrops or even the wars of Erechtheus be adapted to make them better express a properly unified Attica? That these kings did in the developed tradition look forward to Theseus' achievement is clear enough, and I have earlier suggested (above, p. 87) that Cleisthenes and his associates used a number of mythological figures to stress the unity of Attica. But Kekrops and Erechtheus were ultimately unsuitable to prefigure the political events of the last decade of the sixth century. These timeless, static figures could not really be the protagonists of a detailed saga, and the saga is of crucial importance in the significance of Theseus' achievement in Attica. It is essential that Theseus encounter difficulty and opposition in Attica, and hence that the synoecism be achieved only after setbacks and with effort. In the account given by Plutarch, and so far as one can see in those of his atthidographic sources, the achievement of the synoecism and the establishment of democracy are chronologically separate from his struggles with his Attic enemies - the sons of Pallas are already overcome, the kidnapping of Helen and its consequences still to come. But even Plutarch is aware, realistically enough, that in the intermediate stages Theseus was likely to have faced strong opposition (Theseus 24). In the earlier tradition, before a chronological sequence was carefully mapped out, it is likely that the struggles and difficulties stood in a much closer relation to the achievement. In particular, the conflict with the Pallantidai marks the change from a state of division into one of unity. In this part of the story, the division of Attica among the sons of Pandion is no longer a way of representing the distinction of the various areas of the country, but has become a distinct phase which can be placed in time. The defeat of the sons of Pallas represents an essential part of the work of uniting Attica under one central government. The synoecism, then, was not accomplished with the ease with which Kekrops introduced writing or instituted certain sacrifices. There was opposition to Theseus just as there was opposition to Cleisthenes. Again, one cannot press the details too far; the operative point in the minds of those who (consciously or unconsciously) framed the comparison was surely that a great and worthy enterprise of this type was bound to provoke some hostile reactions. It is noteworthy too that the favourable picture of Theseus did not entirely succeed in expunging some of his less creditable exploits. The rape of Helen and the attempt on Persephone (among others) are certainly not inventions of this period, 4V but it may well be due to opposition to the political implications of Theseus that such conditions survived. Both supporters and opponents of Cleisthenes might perpetuate in mythical terms the tradition of opposition, but Theseus' arbitrary behaviour in kidnapping the child Helen and resisting her - Spartan - brothers the Tyndaridai would square very well with opposition on the behalf of the latter-day representatives of the north-eastern Attic heroes who opposed Theseus. In other words, perhaps, the inhabitants of the Marathonian Tetrapolis, dismembered in Cleisthenes' tribal reforms, regarded the Alcmaeonid's behaviour as lawless and arbitrary, no better than that of his forerunner. It is also particularly remarkable that the hero Marathos, whose story has clearly been formed by the battle named from his deme, dies in a sort of devotio , fighting against Theseus. North-eastern hostility again, but this takes us beyond Cleisthenes, and is possibly directed against the family of Miltiades and Cimon; Theseus was said to have 4X J.

Thus if the prototype of the Marathon dead was an enemy of Theseus, this would seem to have anti-Philaid implications: perhaps after all, the story would say, the credit for Marathon did not belong to Miltiades. But the importance of the new Theseus in Athenian self-consciousness outlasted Cleisthenes, and outlasted Cimon. The Theseus, for instance, of the Heracles or Oedipus at Col onus is not an isolated dramatic creation, but reflects an underlying and generally accepted picture. There are certain common characteristics in the Theseus of late fifth-century tragedy; unlike, say, Creon or Odysseus, he is not a figure who is varied at will. Theseus the just and merciful patron of suppliants reflects the Athenians' perception of themselves as the most hospitable of people, mirrored (directly or indirectly) in so many suppliant plays set in Athens. His consistent presentation in tragedy may be connected with contemporary reality. As a hero, he continued to offer protection to runaway slaves and other people of the humbler classes of society.50 He is, of course, a constitutional monarch, and reacts indignantly - in phrases of political commonplace - to suggestions that the people of Attica might be 'enslaved' like the subjects of a tyrant (Soph. OC 916-7): Kai (loi Jtó'iv KEvavÔpov fļ ÔoûA.r|v ti va éôoÇaç eïvai, Kāļa' vaov xâ) liiļSevi; Did you think that mine is some slave city or one devoid of men, and that I am as nothing? Sometimes, indeed, he is the patron of a democracy, no longer a king at all. In Euripides' Supplices (406-8) he tells the Argive herald that Athens is an ¿Xeudépa JtóXiç where ôf||K&gt;ç ô' àváoaei ôiaôo%aîaiv ëv ļiepei èviawíaiaiv, ot&gt;xì t&lt;¡&gt; łt^oiktp ôíSouç to jcXeîcrtov, áXXà x® Jtévriç è'xcov ïaov. The people are king, ruling by turns in annúal succession; they do not give most power to the rich, but the poor man too has an equal share. This anachronistic picture carried enough conviction to be put forward in atthidographic sources, and hence reported in Plutarch's Life of Theseus, where (ch. 24) Theseus resigns the monarchy and establishes a democracy. Synoecism and democracy: here again there is an echo of Cleisthenes, who in the tradition accepted by Herodotus established the tribes and the democracy at Athens (5.66). But once again the association survived the more immediate political context. Despite the survival of traditions in which Theseus is the enemy of the more minor and more intimate local heroes, especially of the north-east, and in which his exploits show arrogance and violence rather than benefits towards mankind, it is clear enough that in the main current of Athenian thought Theseus was responsible for the characteristic political form of Attica and expressed in his person the best characteristics of Athenian civic life. 50 Stated in Plut. The s. 36.4; cf. Ar. fr. 577 K-A, and perhaps Pherecrates fr. 49 K.</page><page sequence="127">1 20 THE HEROES OF ATTICA 3. Theseus and his entourage: the interaction of cult and myth A third set of factors can be recognised in the creation of heroic mythology, and these are such as can operate only when some heroic saga has already come into being. The type of story we shall now consider is that of the minor figure in the ambience of a greater hero or of greater events. The case of Theseus will serve to illustrate the process, as here our documentation is fullest, and we have already considered some possible reasons for the Thesean connexions of so many local and deme heroes. We have seen that the most important factor lying behind the creation of the Theseus saga was the desire for a heroic figure who would express in himself the developed forms and ideals of Athenian political life. But there was of course some Thesean material in existence before this. There were traditions known to Hesiod and other early writers and vase-painters. Similarly, there were additions to the stock of material after the new significance of Theseus had begun to establish itself. The great hero - and Theseus is not alone in this - begins to attract smaller heroes into his circle. In this he of course invites comparisons with gods, for perhaps the majority of divine cults include subordinate heroic figures within the whole complex of worship. Yet while the pattern of heroes surrounding a god may have influenced the configuration of minor heroes in the entourage of a greater, especially perhaps through the intermediary of ambiguous figures like Herakles who may be either hero or god,51 the picture presents some important differences. In the case of the god, one of the most important functions of the hero is to explain and sanction, in 'historical' terms, the whole form of the cult. In the hero's case, though complexes of divine cult are probably the ultimate model, other factors are at work, and the emphasis is more, perhaps, on myth and saga than on cult, although cult may be influenced by the new mythical connexions which are formed. Figures such as Konnidas, Theseus' paidagogos, or Phorbas, his charioteer or wrestling teacher,52 spring on the one hand from the desire to fill out what was known of Theseus' life, on the other from the wish to give minor heroes a Thesean connexion. Konnidas was actually worshipped in connexion with Theseus. Similar in the second respect are Theseus' steersmen, Nausithoös or Nauseiros and Phaiax. We have seen that their Odyssean names and Salaminian origin reveal that they had an importance before they came into the orbit of Theseus; and I have already argued that their cult is likely to have been the special province of two genē, *he Phoinikes and Salaminioi, and that the Salaminioi had a particular interest in establishing a connexion between Theseus and their own cults. The whole complex of heroa at Phaleron of which these two form a part has very strong Thesean elements. Skiros is also represented there; he was the king of Salamis (and in local tradition author of the Salaminian synoecism!) who provided Theseus with Nausithoös and Phaiax. He too is worshipped by the Salaminioi. Skiros retains, no doubt, much of his original character associations, while in the case of the 'hero at the stem', it seems that previously independent seafaring heroes became part of a larger circle, influenced no doubt by the propensity of great heroes to have heroic helmsmen.53 We do not know whether Theseus himself was worshipped in the festival of his helmsmen, the Kybernesia. But he did intrude into the pattern of another festival of Phaleron, the Oschophoria. Again we have no knowledge of actual sacrifices in his honour in this festival, 51 Commonly associated with Herakles in cult are members of his family such as Alkmene or loleos, while Diomos supplies an example of a hero who stands in a similar relationship to Herakles as he might to a more normal god. 52 Konnidas: Plut. Thés. 4. Phorbas: Pherecydes FGrH 3 F 152; Istros FGvH 334 F 31 denies the tradition. E. Suppl. 680, ARV- 1 268. 1 , further testify to the connexion with Theseus. 53 Compare Meneleos (above, pp. 41-2) and Aeneas.</page><page sequence="128">HEROIC MYTHOLOGY 1 2 1 which is basically a vintage celebration concerned with Athena Skiras and Dionysos, but the aetiologies connecting certain feature of the festival with the return of Theseus and his companions from Crete, if they were at all widespread before being taken up by the atthidographers, cannot but have influenced the general apprehension of the character of the rite. As in some sense the founder of the festival, Theseus is in fact very likely to have received some sacrifice; and the Oschophoria seem also to have fallen on a day very near that on which Theseus' own festival was celebrated. The major factor in these connexions is likely to have been the eagerness of the Salaminioi to give themselves good Attic credentials, since they needed to prove themselves both Salaminian and Attic. While Theseus was still, so to speak, a rising star, it was possible and advantageous to introduce him into the family cults and traditions; one way of doing this was through the family's own special heroes. Rather similar, it would seem, is the relationship of Theseus to the Phytalidai.54 The cults of this family were concerned with vegetable fertility and with purification; their archegete had been taught how to grow figs by Demeter herself, and theirs was the Sacred Fig-tree at Lakiadai on the road to Eleusis. Naturally enough the complex of cults had been brought into connexion with Eleusis itself, by way of the procession from Athens. A hero such as Theseus was less easy to accommodate; but the story of his journey from Megara brought him conveniently close to Lakiadai, where of course he would require purification from the blood shed on the way. (This sort of advertising technique, appealing to the great men of the past, is paralleled by the Eleusinian initiations of Herakles and the Dioskouroi.) In return for this, Plutarch tells us (ch. 23), the family was entrusted with certain sacrifices, to the hero, perhaps also in connexion with the Oschophoria. The pattern of the story surely reflects the reality; it can have been only by virtue of their claim to have purified Theseus that the family acquired this priestly function. In such cases as this, myth clearly precedes and inspires ritual. But as far as the minor hero is concerned, this example differs from the preceding: here we see the amplification of the Theseus story by a genos for their own reasons without the attachment of a subordinate hero.55 Phytalos himself, standing at the beginning of agricultural history, was clearly an unsuitable candidate to purify a figure of the true Heroic Age. Plutarch speaks of the 'hospitality' of the Phytalidai (ch. 12), and this is obviously a necessary element in the purification which they performed. But the best-known hospitality story in the Theseus saga was of course, at least after Callimachus, that of Hekale. The festival known as the Hekalesia, celebrated in honour of Hekale and (Zeus) Hekalos or Hekaleios in the village named likewise Hekale, and involving the participation of the neighbouring villages, was presumably quite old in origin; it has no very obvious relations with other cults, and presents features, such as the use of the affectionate diminutive 'Hekaline', which puzzled the commentators. Although north-east Attica is one of the places where Theseus is most at home, it is hard to suppose that he had a place originally in this cult of a paired god and goddess. It is far more likely that local tradition as it were humanised Hekale and produced the connexion with Theseus, once the story of the Marathonian bull was established. A minor heroine gives hospitality to a greater hero: here again is the resemblance with a common divine pattern, that of the theoxeny, and again, as Jacoby suggests, Herakles, who was entertained by Molorchos, may be the intermediary.56 In contrast with the divine pattern, however - and that of the 54 Plut. Thes. 12.1,23.5. 55 Comparable, although clearly no specific genos associations are involved, is the Troizenian aetiology which relates the cult of Athena Apatouria to the deception (amtrļ) of Aithra by Poseidon, which of course resulted in the great hero's birth: Paus. 2.33.1. 56 Jacoby on Philoch. FGrH 328 F 109 (HIB Suppl. p. 436).</page><page sequence="129">1 22 THE HEROES OF ATTICA Phytalidai - Hekale does not institute a cult of Theseus. What happens is almost the opposite, for it is Hekale, presumably originally some sort of divine figure, who is rewarded with cultic honours. Heroic saga may appropriate some of the forms of the theoxeny, but the hero cannot consistently play all the roles of the god. The idea of the existence of Amazons, and perhaps their heroic cult also, clearly has much wider significance than their appearance merely as enemies of Theseus. The tradition of the Amazon attack on Athens makes perfect sense no matter who the Athenian commander was. It represents the threat posed to established Athenian values by the violent incursion of foreigners whose system of norms is quite other: civilisation against barbarism, in fact. No doubt in its developed form the myth was strongly reminiscent of the struggle with those other easterners, the Persians.57 Like other enemies, the Amazons when buried may have offered a protective function to the city which they once attacked; Antiope's burial near the Itonian gate suggests that she may have protected it, and the regular sacrifice once offered to the Amazons presumably guaranteed their favour. But in the story, the Amazons were the enemy of the whole country, not the special concern of one part of it. No subdivision of the community can be supposed to have felt itself the special concern of the Amazons, and so the attachment of the Amazon story to Theseus is rather different from that of the figures we have been considering. As the Amazons represent the antithesis of Athenian civilisation, so their opponent must be the man who above all epitomises the qualities of that civilisation. But this connexion with Theseus is quite sufficient to ensure a connexion also in cult, for the sacrifice to the Amazons, though discontinued in Plutarch's day ( Thes . 27.7), occurred before, and so in connexion with, the Theseia. Different again is the connexion of Theseus with the heroes identified with Androgeos, son of Minos, to avenge whose death the annual tribute of youths and maidens was paid. Two separate heroes seem to have been canvassed as Androgeos, one in the Kerameikos, otherwise known as Eurygyes, for whom funeral games were held, and the other at Phaleron, referred to as the fípcoç Kata 7tpt&gt;ļuvav.5K These seem to be two rival identifications, schematised in atthidographic writings, of cult heroes with a pre-existing figure of saga and legend. Presumably Androgeos appeared in the Theseid(s), and it was the popularity of that work or group of works which did much to stimulate these mythological embroideries around obscure heroes. The connexion with Theseus is then a rather tenuous one, and the appearance of Androgeos is perhaps due more to an interest in finding the tombs of the heroes of epic, rather than in connecting heroes specifically with Theseus. 57 See J. Boardman, 'Herakles, Theseus and Amazons' in The Eye of Greece: Studies in the Art of Athens, ed. D. C. Kurtz and B.

Minor, local heroes might well have no genealogy: one could easily be supplied. Yet the only certain example known to us is the following, pieced together from various sources: Theseus - Perigoune, d. of Sinis Melanippos i 1 Myrmex loxos, a Carian eponym Melite -1- Herakles ? The complete genealogy will not do as it stands, of course; any Athenian of the fifth century would have rejected a construction which produces such a chronological discrepancy between the contemporaries Theseus and Herakles. Nonetheless there is a certain logic about it; Herakles, Melite, Myrmex and Melanippos, and presumably also a son of Melite and Herakles are all heroes of the deme of Melite or adjacent Skambonidai. It was natural enough that they should be grouped together genealogically; less obvious that Melanippos should be the son of Theseus and Perigoune, and in fact another trad'Mon makes him son of Kyklops, son of Zeuxippos.5'' The Thesean version is merely elaboration, in despite of chronology, for the sake of relating Melanippos, and perhaps the nearby heroes, to the great hero of Athens. Perhaps this device was used more often; it is simple enough. But although Theseus' entanglements with women are well enough documented, apart from Melanippos he fathered to our knowledge only Hippolytos and perhaps Iphigeneia, who each have their own importance in cult, and Akamas and Demophon.60 In the case of these last, Theseus' only legitimate sons, the connexion with Theseus is fundamental to their character. They belong strictly in the circle of Theseus, in a way in which Melanippos, perhaps, does not; despite the colonising exploits of Akamas, sometimes performed in company with Phaleros, another Thesean hero, it is hard to imagine these two existing independently of Theseus.61 The circle of Theseus, then, consists of a number of pre-existing heroes whose relation to the great hero himself may fulfil a variety of functions. There is less evidence for the creation of Thesean heroes ex nihilo' with the possible exception of Akamas and Demophon, the norm seems to be the attachment of 'small' heroes to Theseus by means of a connexion in story; where the cult is related, as it often is, we must assume that it follows, not precedes, the new myth. In contrast with the heroes who cluster around gods, the effect of those in the entourage of Theseus is to fill out the outlines of Theseus' life and to make him a more fully human figure, one who can plausibly be the subject of a biographical sketch (even one where the material is 'full of marvels and dramatic happenings, the province of poets and mythographers', as his biographer remarks.63) The process is self-perpetuating: once biographical details of the hero become popularised, further detail is almost inevitably added, and other figures gain a new •w Photius s.v.

Even those heroes of the north-east, perhaps also of Eleusis,61 whose relationship to Theseus is one of hostility, end up by performing the same function; they are figures in the background of Theseus' life. All over Attica there are figures connected with the great hero of the synoecism. Perhaps Theseus' enemies, connected as they are with the less favourable tradition of his life, express among other things traditions of separatism; his adventures with Helen were not acceptable. His other relationships represent the more positive side of this phenomenon, the feeling for Attica as a unity - although clearly the process was sporadic and unconscious, operating largely in an individual way for individual heroes. M Plut. Thes. 1 1 relates that Theseus killed Kerkyon at Eleusis and Prokroustes at Erineos.</page><page sequence="132">7: PERSPECTIVES Now that we have explored the different stages in the development of heroic story and saga, and seen some of the functions of this type of story, it is time to tum from the hero of epic and myth to the hero as a whole, composed of both cultic and mythic aspects. We have traced through many heroic byways functions of explanation, of the summing-up of qualities and identity in a personal form, and such considerations take us close to the inner workings of the hero. If it is not possible to find one definition which will fit all heroes, to say precisely and without equivocation 'what a hero is', the evidence and the situations so far examined may allow us to say a little more about what the hero does for the people who worship him, at least in one Greek society. In the light of this evidence we may now re-examine some of the more general questions touched on in the first chapter and sketch a little further some possible positions of the hero in the society of gods and men. The belief in beings somehow intermediate between men and gods, or who are a mixture of the two things; even the occasional worship of a dead man or woman as a god or demi-god - none of these is a particularly unusual phenomenon, though they do not in themselves suffice to explain the cult of heroes. Jewish and Christian angels, Gnostic daemons, Vaisnava and perhaps Buddhist avatars, and the figure of Christ, 'two natures in one person' - diverse as are their natures and functions, and the systems of which they form part, can all very broadly be placed within this category. It seems likely that it is against such a background that the class of heroes should be viewed: I shall return to this point, which explains much that seems contradictory and paradoxical in the hero's nature. Heroes, whether individually or as a category, are sometimes approximated to gods, sometimes opposed to them; this will depend on area and on individual cult, as well as on more intangible points of emphasis. Such a polarity seems not unexpected for a group forming the middle term of a series. When the group of three is reduced to two, as not infrequently happens in such a series, heroes may move either towards gods or towards men. Closeness to gods is perhaps the more prevailing mode of thought. Heroes are like gods in that they receive cult, and cult of a sort which is at least directly comparable to that given to gods. In the period before a separate category of heroes is thoroughly established, proto-heroes are described in terms suitable to gods, as Ôotíjioveç, (iáicapeç and so on, although the fact that early texts do not describe such beings unequivocally as deóç may suggest that they were recognised as something slightly different. They may also be seen as men, but men of a past age, a mythical time, whether schematized into a sequence of ages as in Hesiod or merely located in a time before the norms of society were established, as Erechtheus in Homer. Later, however, we do start to find examples of apparent heroes who are termed 'gods'. The orgeones who worship Hypodektes refer to him as god, and the Athenian hero physician is indifferently fípcoç and deóç.1 Earlier, we have the case of Kolonos in Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus ; although he is not called rípcoç, he is clearly the eponymous hero of the deme, and yet he is described as Oeóç. These examples need not reflect classical usage; the first two are relatively late, and the case of Kolonos might be explained by the play's own setting (like the Homeric narrative) in the heroic period, so that a reference to a hero in the cult sense would be out of place.2 Nonetheless, they indicate a close kinship between hero and god. 1 Hypodektes: IG II2 2501 (late fourth century, just a little early for the shake-up of categories (above, pp. 4-6). but not impossible). "Hpoç iaxpóç IG II2 839 (third century). 2 This explanation is suggested by Nicholas Richardson. 125</page><page sequence="133">1 26 THE HEROES OF ATTICA Against this we may place the well-known trends, in ritual and elsewhere, which point to a view of the hero as the diametrical opposite of the god (above, pp. 3-4). Some of the rituals directed towards heroes are clearly akin to the funeral rites, the vó|ii|ia, paid to the dead. Yet they also have points of contact with ritual appropriate to chthonic and underworld deities, so that perhaps on this scheme it makes more sense to see an opposition between upper and lower powers than between hero and god. Such a conceptual divide is clearly present in fifth-century thought, even if like most such schemes it is not universally present.' The same material can be arranged in different ways to produce differing patterns of thought even within the same society, even within the same individual, and this is a further factor in the difficulties we have in placing the hero. Thus it is that sometimes the hero is viewed primarily as a dead man and therefore capable of conveying pollution, while at others he does not pollute and is different from the ordinary dead. Certain cults expressed the opposition between hero and god by forbidding those who had taken part in heroic sacrifices to approach a god until after purification, or by forbidding the officiants of certain divine cults to come into contact with heroes.4 Yet even if we set aside a certain degree of carelessness about pollution in actual practice it is clear that these examples do not express a normal and universal way of thought. Pausanias, whose own views on keeping human activities and the gods apart seem to tend to strictness," comments on the relevant sacrifice at Olympia (barring anyone who has eaten at the sacrifice to Pelops from entering the precinct of Zeus) by reference to a similar custom at Pergamon, which suggests that he found it striking and unusual. Further, some regulations explicitly draw a distinction between the heroic and the ordinary dead; heroes, unlike the rest, are non-polluting, and thus fall on the same side of the divide as gods.6 Just as it seems that the 'new', familial heroes were not equally present in every locality (above, p. 6), it is unlikely that every point on this spectrum was represented in every part of the Greek world. It may not be entirely coincidental that Attica seems to furnish no clear example of a hero conveying pollution;7 after all, it was also to a large extent Attic examples which illustrated Nock's demonstration that the hero and the god are not always and inevitably opposed. Attic sacrifice calendars give no indication of a divide between divine and heroic cult; the typical form is rather that one festival will include sacrifices to both gods and heroes. Neither is it the case that pollution in the face of the god is avoided by placing the heroic sacrifice after the divine, for very often it takes the form of a Jipodvļia, a preliminary offering before the more splendid ritual for the god. It would appear that in Attica the pattern approximating the hero to man and opposing him to god was less predominant than in some other parts of the Greek world. In the case of individual cult figures, even the boundaries between hero and god can be fluid. Hypodektes, if we accept that the usage is old, may be an example of a relatively minor figure who crosses the boundary; so, of course, in a wider context, are such major figures as Herakles, Asklepios, the Dioskouroi. This is perhaps especially common in the case of females, where ' Polarity is clearly indicated for instance at A. Suppl. 24-5, A, if. 890, E. Hec. 146-7. In actual practice, both upper and lower powers are frequently greeted together, as at A. Pers. 499, Ar. Eq. 156 and especially emphatically at Soph. OC 1654-5. 4 Heroic and divine cults separated: Olympia and Pergamon, Paus. 5.13.3. Pollution caused by contact with heroes: LSCG I56A.8-I0 (Cos), I54A 22, 37 (also Cos, with reference to the priestess of Demeter). Further examples in Nock, Essays II 577-8. 5 Paus. 10.32.13. 6 Thus at Cyrene, LSS 1 15A.2I-5, Battos, Onymastos and the Tritopatores are exceptions to the normal rule that contact with tombs involves pollution. The widespread custom of placing heroes' tombs in the agora (above, p. 9) also presupposes this notion. 7 Pace Sokołowski ( LSCG 268) the reason for the labelling of heroa as aßata is not necessarily that they convey pollution.</page><page sequence="134">PERSPECTIVES 127 f|po)ívr| (or equivalent) and viiļKpiļ seem frequently to be used interchangeably (above, p. 22 and n. 69). Terminology is flexible: cult often gives us no clear distinction. So far from expressing a radical opposition in the beings worshipped, the ritual in the cult of the heroine Pandrosos, we are told, is identical to that given to the divinity Thallo." Yet something separates them, also: most obviously, Pandrosos is credited with a human past as daughter of Kekrops. This would seem further to underline the crucial importance of the development of myth in the formation of a class of heroes; it is myth, narrative, which is usually the plainest statement of a difference between mortal and immortal. Related to the myth in this case is the role of the heroine in a divine festival, the Arrephoria, where Thallo is not, presumably, her equivalent. In this ritual the leading divine role was taken by Athena, and it was Pandrosos who was chiefly associated with her; this is mirrored in the myth of the tendance of Erichthonios. Whether myth or ritual comes first is of course the chicken-and-egg question of Greek religion, but both the myth and the ritual link with the goddess seem to be important to Pandrosos' status as heroine. Whether closeness or antithesis is in question, we can at least say that it is often by some sort of relationship with a god that a figure is defined as a hero oť heroine. Several of the 'antithesis' cases we have touched on express an opposition not so much between the status of hero and of god as between individual exemplars: Pelops and Zeus, Telamón and Asklepios (Paus. 5.13.3). In some ways this pattern is comparable to the much commoner (at least in Attica) system where the hero appears as the god's subordinate.9 One of the most interesting and characteristic forms of this last pattern, the hero as the god's close subordinate, is that in which he is given instructions by the deity and becomes the first performer of some 'craft' (Te^viļ) or the institutor of a particular form of worship. Whether it is desired to explain the cultivation of the fig-tree or the worship of Herakles as a god, one of the commonest aetiological patterns is that where instructions are given by a god to a specially favoured individual who becomes the first mortal to practice the new inventions and who, on the cult level, becomes a hero worshipped in the context of the instructor-god. Typically the hero's tomb is to be found within a divine sanctuary, he receives a lesser sacrifice at the festival of the deity, and in myth he was the god's first priest in that locality. We have seen in abundance heroes corresponding to this pattern among the archegetes of the genē: other well- known Attic examples are Iphigeneia, Aglauros, and Ikarios, and the type seems to be common throughout the Greek world. In this scheme, obviously, we have to do with closeness to the divine rather than antithesis, but the hero's relations with man are also a defining factor. It is the hero or heroine who teaches the generality of mankind the skill imparted by the divinity, and in the case of cult practices, as we have seen (ch. 4), the hero normally becomes the cult's first priest, and archetype, sometimes even ancestor, for the priest in the contemporary world. Here then we have a true three-term series in which the hero is intermediate between god and man; not only intermediate, in fact, but in one sense mediating, because at some point in the past he conveyed the god's instructions or benefactions to mortals and (usually) set up a channel of communication between divinity and humankind. One document of Attic relevance, the Homeric Hymn to Demeter , treats this pattern explicitly and at length: it is therefore of particular value in assessing the intermediate position of the institutor hero. The Eleusinian complex of myth and ritual is made more difficult by the existence of several aspirants to this role; the Hymn itself seems to divide the role among several characters, while later ages tend to substitute Triptolemos for the Hymn's Demophon as * Paus. 9.35.2. 9 Erechtheus, as so often, is a case of particular interest here, combining opposition to Poseidon (in myth) with closeness (in cult).</page><page sequence="135">1 2K THE HEROES OF ATTICA the child favoured by the goddess. This multiplicity of figures is of course mirrored in the very large number both of heroes and of cult personnel connected with the Mysteries. It is to several of the princes of Eleusis that Demeter reveals the Mysteries; the poet then turns abruptly from past tenses to present, emphasizing that this was the moment of foundation of rites still in use today (473ff.): iļ 8è Kioûoa ůe[xioxoKÓXo'q ßaai^eüai ô[eî^e,] Tpi7tTOĀ.eļLiq) xe Aïoic^eî xe 7i^T1^Í7t7cq), Ei)1ió^7ioD xe ßit1 Ketecp ťT f|yrļxopi tax&amp;v, SprļGfiocnivīļv ťT íep&amp;v Kai ërcéippaôev öpyia rcaoi, oejivá, xá xł o'i na&gt;ç è'oxi mpe^[iļi]ev [oiixe nvôéoô ai,] o'ixł àxéeiv jiëya yáp xi ťte&amp;v aeß aç iaxávei ai&gt;ôr|v. öXßiog oç xáô' ÖTUonev . . . She went, and to the kings who dispensed justice, to Triptolemos and to Diokles driver of horses, to mighty Eumolpos and to Keleos, leader of the people, she showed the act of the holy things and instructed them all in the rites, the solemn rites which one may not transgress nor learn of nor utter, since a great reverence for the gods restrains the voice. Happy is he who has seen these things ... We are left to assume, therefore, that the heroes conveyed the rites to others and so established a succession, the modern representatives of which legitimately convey Demeter's benefits to those who present themselves for initiation. As the priest now mediates between the Eleusinian deities and the worshippers, so, even more clearly, did the founding heroes, and the effect of that mediation is still present. But the Hymn also leads us back to the question of the hero and death, for the Mysteries were not Demeter's first attempt to benefit a member of the human race. At first her gratitude had had a smaller scope, and she had tried to fulfil it by immortalising Keleos' son Demophon. The interruption of the process by the child's mother Metaneira evidently made it impossible or undesirable to continue, and as a substitute for immortality Demophon was given heroic honours (263-7): X11L1T1 5' ôupdixoç aièv ërceaoexai oüvem yoúvcov f||i£xépü)v erceß r| Kai év àyKÓvflaiv ïotvaev.

Unfading glory will be his for ever, because he sat in my lap and slept in my embrace. And for him in season, with the circling years, the children of the Eleusinians will always among each other wage war and dread strife, for ever. In this tradition, also represented by the myth of Pelops,10 immortality is the clear preserve of the gods; heroic honours, as a substitute for this state, are also a negation of it. At some time after the events of the Hymn, Demophon died; and death and mortality are what separate heroes from gods and place them closer to men. But (of course) this is not a universal pattern. Sometimes heroes are thought not to die, but to be translated: &lt;pí^xať&gt;' Áp|ióôie, oi&gt; xi jud xéôvriKaç." Such a concept looks back to the destiny of Menelaos in the Odyssey: it is not your fate, god-nurtured Menelaos, to die and 10 Like Demophon, Pelops is a failed immortality candidate, and like Demophon he fails through the transgression of a parent. It may be significant that it is he who provides one of the most striking examples of cultic antithesis to a god (above, n. 4). 11 PMG 894: 'Dearest Harmodios, you are not dead.'</page><page sequence="136">PERSPECTIVES 129 meet your end in horse-trodden Argos, but the Immortals will send you to the plain of Elysion, the limits of the earth, where is fair-haired Rhadamanthys, there where life is easiest for men ...'l2 This privileged existence is not one which happens after death, but instead of death, quite the opposite of Demophon's case. Lucian's Menippos might very well have amused himself with such contradictions; modern scholars, a little more sympathetically, point out the simultaneous existence of incompatible ideas within the same mind, especially where death and the afterlife are concerned.11 There is room, too, for uncertainty. What happens to Oedipus? Before his passing, he speaks plainly of dying (o'&gt; |ie xpil ûaveîv, 1521), of his grave and the power he will exercise from it (621-3, 1545-6), yet his grave will be not a place of pollution but 'holy', íepóç (and surely íepòç tú|ipoç is an oxymoron), and the messenger leaves open the possibility that he disappeared with an escort from the gods (1661-2). We are not meant to solve this problem: in the hands of Sophocles, as indeed on occasion in religious experience, contradiction and lack of clarity become mystery. Above all, though, Oedipus is not to be lamented (however little his daughters heed this point). He is not to be attended with any of the normal paraphernalia of death, indeed he cannot be, since there is no visible body to which the normal rites can be paid. Here, then, the heroic passing stands apart from the ordinary death; and yet often, of course, laments and other forms of behaviour which are appropriate immediately after the death of an ordinary member of family or community occur also in the cult of heroes.14 The criterion of death, with no fewer contradictions than that of status, marks out the changing position of the hero on a scale between man and god; not surprisingly, since more than anything else it is death which marks the frontier between the two. At this point it is natural, perhaps, to tackle the long delayed question of the hero's origins. I said at the beginning that the hero is not only an intermediate being: can the circumstances of his origins throw further light on what else he is? The questions of nature and of origins are so clòsely related that at times arguments about them are in danger of becoming circular, but it is still possible, I think, to advance some way by examining how well the chief theories of the hero's origins stand up to what we have seen of the situation in archaic and classical Attica. It was Farnell who first seriously urged the proposition that hero-cult was in a sense the creation of the epic, the response of ordinary people to the awesome deeds of the great warriors of yesteryear, and with various modifications this view until recently was more or less orthodoxy.15 It was put on a firmer footing by more recent attempts, notably that of Nicholas Coldstream, to show systematically that later offerings in Mycenaean tombs, denoting cult paid to the inhabitants, coincide roughly with the supposed period of the wide diffusion of the epic on the Greek mainland.16 If we accept that these offerings occur after a break and are not part of continuous activity around the tombs,17 then this gives us a coherent enough picture over the 12 Od. 4.561-5: ooì 8' où ôeocpaxóv coti, õiotpeípèç a&gt; MeveX-ae, 'ÂpTEi év iTtnoßoxa) ôaveeiv Kai 7tóx|iov ércicnteìv, àXXá o' éç 'HXudiov jteôíov Kaì nei p axa yaíriç àôávaxoi 7tE|iVļ/ouaiv, odi Çavdòç 'PaSánavduç Tfļ Jtep pTļtOTri ßlOXT1 7t£Ä£l CtVÖpÜMtOlOlV. 11 Nock, HThR 25 (1932) 332-3 = Essays 1.286; Nilsson, Rev. hist. phil. rei.

That the epic may often have been an influential factor behind the awe and veneration seems very likely. But although this theory has sometimes been referred to as a sort of universal explanation of hero-cult, neither Famell nor Coldstream has in fact made such claims; Coldstream concludes his treatment of the problem by considering three cults which seem to predate the diffusion of the epic, one of which, that of Erechtheus, is of course mentioned in Homer. Of the three cults, it may be significant for our purpose to note that two are Attic, and Coldstream himself admits that Attica seems to be in a peculiar position. And yet it is of course one of the parts of Greece which does furnish examples of Mycenaean tombs containing Geometric votives. The classic example is that of the tholos tomb at Menidi (Acharnai), where the occupant of this particularly impressive burial site was given votive offerings from the mid-eighth century onwards, although there is no trace of cult later than the fifth century, and it is not clear whether the heroic inhabitant was identified with any character of epic.111 Some other examples of later cult, such as those in certain of the Mycenaean tombs in the Athenian agora, represent a different, though clearly related, phenomenon; later workmen come upon the tombs by accident, and in response make an offering of propitiation.19 Regular cult, however, is indicated for instance at the Mycenaean tomb 1 on the acropolis of Thorikos. A covered bothros in this tomb was found to contain sherds of the seventh to fifth centuries; to the left of the bothros was a large limestone slab, probably a table for offerings.20 One can scarcely refrain from wondering which of the heroes of the sacrifice-calendar this might represent! But such cases tell us no more than the fact - interesting though this is for the Greek view of their heroes - that tombs of the Mycenaean period could often be thought of as the tombs of heroes and heroines. To illustrate Coldstream's main thesis, two further factors are needed: the commencement of cult in the Geometric period, co aiding with the spread of familiarity with the epic on the mainland, and a secure identification of the burial with a figure celebrated in epic poetry. Both would appear to be present in a striking case at Eleusis, if Mylonas has correctly identified a group of Middle Helladic tombs containing later offerings as the tombs of the leaders of the expedition against Thebes.21 Pausanias (1.39.2) describes a heroön on the road from Eleusis to Megara belonging to these leaders, and the monument is also mentioned by Plutarch ( Theseus 29). Archaeology reveals a group of nine tombs (Ait 1-9), of which at least three contain evidence of Late Geometric activity, surrounded by a períbolos wall which is clearly of later date than the tombs themselves and may very also well be Late Geometric. It is not clear how many of these tombs were visible in the post-Mycenaean era, although tombs 5, 8 and 9 are very much deeper than the others and so may have been hidden from view; neither is it clear how many of the original seven were thought to have been buried there (clearly Adrastos survived, and Amphiaraos was normally thought to have been swallowed up by the earth elsewhere). But the numbers could easily have coincided. Cult and epic influence seem to concur very neatly; but in fact there is no necessity to suppose that the first worshippers of these heroes had already made the identification with the leaders against Thebes. The peculiar legend which gave them burial at Eleusis first appears to our knowledge in Aeschylus' '* Coldstream, art. cit. 11-12; H. G. Lolling and others.

In the developed legend, a prominent part is played by Theseus as the generous patron of suppliants, suggesting an early fifth-century date, and the legend may belong rather in the category of those stories which partly depend on epic and yet almost contradict it (above, pp. 105-8). Yet it is scarcely disputable that the epic did at least have a formative influence on some cult. The question is really one of the degree of emphasis it should be given, and of the stage or stages to which its influence should be assigned. If we approach the problem from the other angle - from the hero-cults actually known to have existed from literary or epigraphic sources - we find the 'epic' model rather inadequate to Attica. There is really very little overlap, as we saw in the last chapter, between the heroes celebrated in the epic and those worshipped in Attica, and where there is such a coincidence the epic seems at least as likely to reflect cult as to have stimulated it. In fact, a major modification to the idea that epic gave rise to hero-cult is necessitated by the occasional appearance of heroic tombs in Homer.22 The Catalogue (//. 2.546-51) gives us a clear reference to the cult of Erechtheus, who seems to be thought of there as the city's archegete, and is worshipped there in an annual festival. And a heroic tomb seems to be presupposed in the case of Phrontis at Sounion. already mentioned (pp. 49-50). Why should Homer narrate the death and burial of this relatively unimportant character, if his tomb were not a well-known landmark? On the other hand, very many of the Attic heroes are not really of the type to appear in Homer. Kalamites the reed-hero, Phytalos the cultivator of the fig, Pandrosos the nurse of the snake- child: can the cult of such figures really be inspired, even indirectly, by the popularity of the epic? Their connexions are often more with complex religious rituals, or else they appear to be simply minor efficacious powers dotted about the countryside. Their cults do not, it seems, centre on the impressive Mycenaean tombs which could indeed so naturally be associated with Homer's heroes. For Attica at least, some other major group of factors must be found. A few of these figures are almost as resistant to explanation in terms of other major theories of the origins of hero-cult. Some of the weaknesses and loose ends in the theories heavily dependent on the epic have been pointed out by A. M. Snodgrass, who prefers to see the root cause of the development of the phenomenon in the apparent land crises of the eighth century. When smallholders settled in the land were threatened with eviction in some form, they turned for help and protection to a former inhabitant of the land, someone powerful with whom they could establish a link. In his later expositions of this theory, Snodgrass is rightly cautious about going further than this and suggesting that claims of descent were consciously made as an appeal to human reason; the focus is more on the hero than on the human adversary.21 In cases of such need, cult might be a natural enough development from local saga and legend - as distinct from epic - or even spring into being without any mythological background at all. This explanation has the merit of bringing us close to the hero's role as saviour and protector and patron of the group - a central feature of the whole phenomenon. But of course there are figures which conspicuously will not fit the pattern. The unpleasant, maleficent hero represented in Attica by Anagyros and elsewhere chiefly by the Olympic victors of the Persian 22 See Th. Hadzisteliou Price, 'Hero-cult and Homer', Historia 22 (1973) 129-44; 'Hero-cult in the "Age of Homer" and earlier' in Arktouros, Studies presented to Bernard Knox (Berlin 1979) 2 19-28. 23 A. M. Snodgrass, 'Les origines du culte des héros dans la Grèce ancienne' in Gnoli et Vemant, edd: La mort, les morts dans les sociétés anciennes (Paris/Cambridge 1982) 107-19. Earlier expositions ( Archaeology and the Rise of the Greek State, inaugural lecture, Cambridge 1977; Archaic Greece (London 1980) 37-40) were less restrained, suggesting that the main function of the newly-created hero was to impress the landholder's claim to his plot on his potential evictors. He goes so far as to speak of 'crude proprietary propaganda'. In this form, of course, the theory is much less acceptable.</page><page sequence="139">1 32 THE HEROES OF ATTICA War years (above, pp. 11-13), though Snodgrass does touch on their existence, cannot really have been much use to people threatened with dispossession and seeking supernatural protection. One suspects that Kalamites and his like are not particularly belligerent, protective heroes either, while Pandrosos and others are, as I have said, so closely related to particular religious rituals that it seems that a great part of their origins must be found there. The same exceptions stand out as stumbling-blocks to Claude Bérarďs theory, which treads ground very similar to that favoured by Snodgrass, but reaches conclusions in some respects diametrically opposite.24 Bérard also links the phenomenon with the great changes in social and political organisation brought by the eighth century, but he sees the hero, so far from being the poor man's protector, as the compensation on the supernatural plane for the loss of power and prestige suffered by the old aristocratic circles. This idea fits very well with Bérarďs own Eretrian, aristocratic protector-heroes at the west gate of the city, and the hero as prince also comes rather closer perhaps than Snodgrass's model to explaining the important civic and group aspects of the hero. Bérarďs work is a significant contribution which cannot be ignored. But if he, or indeed Snodgrass, is right, the form of the hero was soon enlarged and changed somewhat in character. Bérard contends that the new style of hoplite fighting (so often invoked as a potent factor in historical change!), ruling out as it did the old aristocratic, Homeric emphasis on the single combat, was the ultimate cause of apparitions of heroes in battle - the old role of the 'iving aristocrat having been transferred to the hero, perhaps his ancestor and certainly (so to speak) his social equal. Yet - laying aside the consideration that superhuman appearances on the battlefield are a very widespread phenomenon, hardly confined to Greece or to heroes - beside Theseus and the Aiakids, the Persian Wars can also show us the previously unknown Echetlaios, a farmer-hero with a plough, scarcely a figure of particular aristocratic nuance. But such a 'democratising' change is conceivable; more difficult are the groups typified above by Anagyros, Kalamites and Pandrosos. Furthermore, there are chronological difficulties both with this theory and with that of Snodgrass. Although Snodgrass uses the sporadic existence of hero-cults before the eighth century to attack the Cook-Coldstream theory (and recent archaeological work has revealed further possible examples here25), his own explanation, like that of Bérard and to a great extent that of Polignac also,26 is explicitly based on an eighth-century phenomenon. Yet as these authors tacitly acknowledge, it is naively optimistic to expect a tidy solution to the problem which will fit every case. Regional differences are one variable; Attica, as we have seen, does not entirely correspond with impressions of norms gained from taking the whole Greek world together, and the same might be true of other areas.27 The situation will then doubtless be complicated by cross-fertilisation. Even within one area, it now seems obvious, no one cause will suffice to explain the phenomenon of hero-cult, and the considerations so far advanced suggest that we may be dealing with a complex of causes rather less specific than is often imagined. A further consideration is the nature of the actual phenomenon to be explained; it too may be complex rather than simple. When is a hero not a hero? Can there really be a moment at which a previously embryonic phenomenon of hero-cult is suddenly 24 Cl. Bérard. 'Récupérer la mort du prince', in La mort, les morts (n. 23) 89-105. 25 Heroic cult from c. KXX) has been suggested at Lefkandi (M. R. Popham, E. Touloupa and L. H. Sackett, 'The Hero of Lefkandi".

Just as the concept of heroes underwent a great change in the latter part of the fourth century, so too it may have undergone important stages of evolution before reaching its 'classical' stage. Certain elements present in this classical period may have been in existence long before the complex of practice and belief which we call hero-cult had really coalesced. Erechtheus could well have been worshipped on the Acropolis before a category of heroes was present for him to be placed among; but equally his existence, and the existence of others like him, may have some bearing on the genesis of the category. Figures intermediate between god and man, a phenomenon in many religious systems (above, p. 124), are likely to have existed before the classic hero and to have formed one element in his parentage. Erechtheus indeed in Homer, considered apart from the later religious context, appears more as an intermediate figure of this sort than in the guise of the classic hero. His are the people of Athens; he was bom from the earth and brought up by Athena, who placed him in her temple, where the Athenian youths worship him with sacrifice of bulls and sheep. In the Odyssey (7.80), after a burst of activity on Odysseus' behalf, Athena returns to the 'close-built dwelling' of Erechtheus. It is not at all clear that Erechtheus has died or changed his state and become a hero, and yet his status between god and man is ambiguous. His relation to his city seems to be that of a man, his epithet ļieTocX.iļxo)p, great-hearted, is applied to humans; yet his parentage28 and upbringing are strange, his domicile is a temple, and he is worshipped with animal sacrifice apparently as gods are worshipped. Yet while later on Erechtheus retains a somewhat special character, being worshipped on at least some occasions as Poseidon Erechtheus - raising some questions of definitions and identity - and receiving cult in a conspicuous and important place, with unusually magnificent sacrifices, he is also clearly a hero among other heroes; his selection as eponymos guarantees a certain parity.29 Can we begin to analyse the difference between the two states, the factors which differentiate the heroes as a class from the sporadic emergence of halfway figures which nevertheless make the heroes a possibility? Already present in the Catalogue passage is the sense of a close connexion between the being who is worshipped and the city. Erechtheus is introduced after all simply to define the city in question; he is the city patron par excellence. Later periods and fuller evidence present further complexities; Kekrops as well as Erechtheus appears as archegete, and Erechtheus himself seems to have become divided in functions between Erechtheus and Erichthonios. But there is the same essential characteristic; these are all figures who have an intimate relation with the whole people of Athens, considered in this capacity as citizens. In the preceding pages we have seen many examples of variations on this theme. The hero may be an ancient leader of his people who continues to protect and encourage the descendants of those he led in the heroic age; his power continues beyond death, exercised through more mysterious and godlike channels, but directed towards the same ends as it was during his lifetime.1" He may be in various ways a figure who unites the community. A group may meet for his worship or define their corporate existence with reference to him; his existence as a present being, interacting with contemporary worshippers, makes the figure who unites the community more vivid and immediate than the story of his past existence. But the latter too has its function, and often the hero sums up and personifies the characteristics which the group perceives as essential to itself. This public, group aspect seems to be something 2* Th. Hadzisteliou Price, Historia 22 (1973) 136 claims that the birth of Erechtheus demonstrates that he is human, since gods are not bom from the earth; but that was not Hesiod's opinion. - Cf. Loraux, Enfants 54-6. 1(1 A notable variant on this figure is the foreigner or defeated enemy who nonetheless protects the land (pp. 49-50). Here the element of paradox is clearly important, but even in some of these cases something in the hero's lifetime, in his mythical aspect, explains the change of allegiance.</page><page sequence="141">1 34 THE HEROES OF ATTICA extremely important in the make-up of the hero; more specifically, what tends to differentiate the hero from the god in this respect is the addition of a historical perspective, the hero as man of a specific time in history, which may be more or less closely defined. Perhaps it is a time defined by epic generations; perhaps, as with heroic institutor figures, it is an apparently earlier time, at the boundary between a world before our own familiar one and the world in which present customs have become established. Whichever is the case, we have in the hero the convergence of cult paid to a sort of intermediate being with narrative traditions and popular history. To revert to a previous example, this is the criterion which separates Pandrosos from Thai lo (above, p. 126). There are, of course, similar aspects to be found among superhuman beings outside the Greek world; here both differences and similarities are illuminating. Christian saints, for instance, are often linked very closely with particular communities: thus St Januarius, bishop of Naples, is both expressive of Neapolitan identity (as when transported to New York) and the protector of the Neapolitan people (the failure of his blood to liquefy indicating some impending disaster). A major difference, however, lies in the narrative tradition. Saints may have favoured their own cities, but they did not take up arms against other saints; again we see the formative importance of myth. Broadly speaking, the holy men and women of Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and mainstream Hindu traditions bear a much closer resemblance to Christian saints than to Greek heroes; much more comparable to heroes are some of the figures in the popular religious systems of India. 'Hero stones', recording a man's heroic death (and their female equivalent, sati stones), sited often at the point of death and becoming a focus of cult for the community, are common in several parts of the subcontinent. A particularly good parallel is provided by the bhomia of many of the villages of Rajasthan, a real man who died defending the village herds (mainstay of the villagers' livelihood) from robbers, has much in common with the saviour-heroes of individual Greek regions: his shrines are placed at points connected with his death, he continues to intervene in events and protect the village, he receives cult and is approached by village, family and individual.31 Like the Greek hero, he is close to the community's sense of identity, and also like the Greek hero he exhibits a close connexion between past deeds and present function, of mythic and cultic aspects.32 Other Rajasthani 'heroes' were in their lifetime religious innovators or persons of great holiness. Here again we seem to find a correspondence with Greek figures, in this case with those heroes who are instructed by a god or who are the first to perform a particular practice in a religious context. In both systems the hero stands between, even mediates between, the gods and the generality of the human race. Heroes and more particularly perhaps heroines of this type often, though not always, take on something of the qualities of the god with whom they 31 On Indian 'heroes' see R. Thapar, 'Death and the hero', in S. C. Humphreys and H. King, edd: Mortality and Immortality (London 1981) 293-315; on the bhomia type of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, K. Kothari, 'The Shrine; an Expression of Social Needs' in Gods of the Byways , catalogue from the Museum of Modern Art (Oxford 1982) esp. 14-22. (I should like to thank Dr J. D. Smith for advice on this point.) Some parts of India also show cults and myths which are close to the 'unpleasant' hero (above, pp. 11-13); a good example in E. Zel hot and M. Bemtsen, edd.: The Experience of Hinduism: Essays on Religion in Maharashtra (New York 1988) 136-7. 32 Many of these folk-heroes have epics composed about their deeds; recitals of such epics, performed in front of a scroll depicting the hero's deeds in visual form, are considered to be part of the hero's cult and may be performed in order to effect benefits. Despite the connexion between heroes and the epic, recitals of epic do not of course form part of the Greek worship of heroes, although it seems probable that where hymns to heroes were used they would have contained narrative elements, as do most hymns to gods. A further parallel to the Rajasthani custom may be found in the occasional use of the lament, no doubt also incorporating narrative (as E. H F 348-441), at heroic festivals, as for Achilles in Elis (Paus. 6.23.3): see Brelich 81-4, with M. Alexiou, The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition (Cambridge 1974) 55-62. One thinks also of the commemoration of the sufferings of Adrastos which took place at Sikyon, Hdt. 5.67.</page><page sequence="142">PERSPECTIVES 135 are associated; they may even perhaps, like Iphigeneia, originate as an aspect of the deity and only later become assimilated to the human pattern. But as we have seen, in this pattern the humanity of the hero is also important; the myth makes of him or her an undoubted, ordinary human being whose worship of the deity was the pattern for subsequent cult, the model for the worshippers and more especially for the priest, but also the means of communication between man and god, and the middle term in this series. Broadly speaking, this is true of Rajasthani and other Indian figures also; yet in many ways they are more like the saints of other religious traditions than they are like the Greek 'sacral heroes'. They perform great acts, among which may be religious innovations, because they are in a general way close to the divine. With some exceptions, such saints tend to have a much fuller narrative tradition, a vita, in which particular episodes stand out as examples of general principles or themes. In contrast, those Greek heroes who stand in a close relation to the gods or to a god are much more transparently aetiological. It is scarcely over-bold to suggest that they almost never had a historical existence, while the general type of the saint - again individual saints may differ - is based on a real life. The action of Greek sacral heroes is really confined to the single instant when they establish the cult (whether deliberately, thiough divine instruction, or accidentally, when a chance circumstance becomes crystallized into ritual). They do not wander from town to town preaching the cult of a particular deity, or otherwise demonstrating an exceptionally holy life (wanderings are left to the gods themselves, like Demeter and Dionysos). Their closeness to the gods, or rather to one particular god, is a matter of one moment in time, an isolated incident; their existence is relevant only to that instant, though the instant is one of continued relevance. Their mediating role is confined to that moment in the past, kept within the realm of myth and without echoes on the level of cult. In contrast with the 'saint', a large part of the role of the 'sacral hero' seems to be to supply an explanation. Returning to Greek culture and society, heroes fulfilling this sort of function are also in some ways quite different from heroes of the epic or other narrative traditions. The latter are generally situated as a more definite point in time, often computable in terms of generations by those interested in such matters, whereas the priestly heroes fall into such chronological patterns much less convincingly, and seem to exist in a sort of timeless prehistory when the practices which later prevailed were in the process of being formed. But the aetiological, explanatory role which seems so much more important in the sacral hero than in the 'saint' is evident among other Greek heroes as well. Not only specific practices but also particular groups might be explained in Greek thought by reference to an individual - ancestor, leader or jcpôroç eúpetiíç (inventor or discoverer of a craft). In Attica, the typical genos-hero both supplies a religious aition and defines the identity of the genos - genos and rite each having a role in mutual definition. Local communities, groups of orgeones, kinship groups, easily defined themselves with reference to a hero, whose mythology might relate to their own corporate identity or by whose worship they were united. Seen against this background, it was inevitable that the new Cleisthenic tribes should be endowed with heroes. A hero is the natural way of explaining the existence of a group, whether explicitly in the narrative tradition of myth, or implicitly in the action performed by the group in cult. It is somewhat ironic that the hero should have given rise to such demand for explanation, when it seems that originally one of his primary functions was to act as an explanation himself. To generalise very broadly, then, the typical hero seems to represent the coincidence of an intermediate being who receives cult with a narrative, historical dimension - in its widest sense. This dimension may be formed by the tradition of epic, or by local sacral legend, or by</page><page sequence="143">1 36 THE HEROES OF ATTICA nothing more than the hero's tomb, statement that the hero once lived and is now dead. Very commonly either cult or 'narrative' or both has a close relevance to a group or a custom which from one point of view is justified or explained by the hero's existence. Of course, gods too can take on such a function, but heroes, being both more numerous and (generally) more local can often do so more exclusively. One cult complex or one group corresponding to one hero is the typical pattern. Even if the hero defies an ultimate 'explanation', even if elements of a similar phenomenon exist in other times and places, it seems clear enough that his existence is somehow intimately connected with the structure of Greek society, which forms such an intricate pattern of sets, sub-sets and overlapping groups, of inclusiveness and exclusiveness. It seems also that despite earlier examples the eighth century was somehow critical in the crystallization of the category 'hero'; can it be coincidence that while the developed hero is so close to the city the two phenomena are in the process of forming at the same time, or that, as Snodgrass points out in a slightly different context," areas such as Thessaly where polis- organisation is weak and secondary show only few and late hero-cults? The new form of the city and all its associated sub-structures may have created the need for a new form of patron, supplying some sort of symbolic yet concrete definition of who was included and who excluded. But such a connexion naturally poses as many questions as it answers; the relationship of hero to city and to individual is complex. The heroes of Attica impress with their sheer number.'4 The average Athenian male (about women we can be less confident) came up against many different types of heroes in many different roles in the course of his life. Family, club, deme, tribe, city, colony - all were likely to be marked out by heroes, and there would be only a very limited uniformity in the roles these heroes played. An offended hero might be responsible for illness or other disaster; a hero might also give prosperity in a small business, or intervene to prevent a battle-line from breaking up and so lead Athens to victory. Different areas of Attica displayed different patterns. If a Marathonian found himself in Thorikos he would notice that the local heroes were accompanied by several heroines, not by just one as at home; if he went to Erchia, he would find single heroes and separate groups of heroines. In Athens itself he would revere Theseus; at home, he would worship heroes who had opposed him. Sometimes he would meet a hero who was worshipped, but who had no myth and perhaps even no name; in that case, if he were interested in local history, he might try to discover the hero's identity, to identify him with some character of myth or epic. In other cases, the hero's myth would be well-known, perhaps regarded as a model for patriotic behaviour or else as the explanation for some modern custom or institution. Our Athenian would frequently meet heroes, with or without their myths, in the visual arts and in poetry. Major heroes might be portrayed in major monuments, works designed to celebrate the polis. So we seem to find the group of the eponymoi on the Parthenon frieze, and Theseus and Herakles in the Stoa Poikile - in the latter case, not simply as august figures from the past, but as a present help in the here and now, Theseus in the typical guise of the cult hero emerging from the earth. These figures of pan-Attic popularity appear also, and very often, in the more private genre of vase-paintings 11 Snodgrass, Archaic Greece (n. 23) 39. ,4 When I was first working on the material which was to become this book, several people asked me if Cleisthenes would really have been able to send the names of a hundred Attic heroes to the Pythia. Even if we exclude women and those whom mythology declared to be foreigners. Appendix I easily supplies an affirmative answer - and who knows how many more names have vanished from our sight? I am less certain that the case of Attica is unusual: evidence from both literature (and hence also ancient scholarship) and epigraphy is very much fuller than from other areas, and it is also the case that the physical area of Attica is considerably larger than that of most other poleis. The large number of heroes, as of other local cults, present throughout the area does of course argue against 'centralisation' of religion in Attica (see pp. 85-6).</page><page sequence="144">PERSPECTIVES 137 (no doubt originally in other domestic works of art as well) where the most popular themes, by contrast, are those taken from their mythology; these works celebrate in epic style the superhuman deeds of the great men of the past. Already Herakles spans the boundary between Attic cult-figure and panhellenic subject of saga, and many of the heroes on Attic vases are heroes of epic rather than heroes of cult, celebrated in literature throughout Greece rather than important for their local significance. But we also find depictions of strictly Attic heroes, often alongside those better-known figures; the Athenian would realise that the past of his own city was significant. In a similar manner tragedy (no doubt also choral lyric) mixes the local with the panhellenic, and our Athenian would have gained much of his impression of the heroic history of Athens from theatrical festivals (and drama itself was often reflected in painting). Following a well-worn tradition, Pausanias (1.3.3) can still complain that most people have little historical sense, believing what they hear from choral lyric and tragedy, and this is not likely to have been less true in the fifth and fourth centuries. When the hero has such a variety of roles and presentations, it is idle to look for a simple formula to explain his existence. If it is not quite true that our Athenian would meet a hero round every corner, in every activity of his life, the extraordinary richness of Athenian society nonetheless produced countless images of the heroic. The hero is as diverse and multi-faceted as the society of which he is a part.</page><page sequence="145">APPENDIX 1: CATALOGUE OF ATTIC HEROES The selection of material for this list necessarily involves some problems of definition. Some of the figures emerging from the epigraphic testimonia - Alochos, Semeie, Hypodektes, for instance - might seem to be closer to gods than to heroes; many of the characters important in the mythographers have no heroic cult attested. On the principle that heroes and minor gods are not always easy to distinguish, indeed perhaps should not always be distinguished, I have included most of the former category, and since I have tried to demonstrate some of the important functions of heroic myth, appearances in mythology are also a criterion for inclusion. In other words, all names with a cult connexion appear (I hope), but names which appear once only in genealogies or on vases have been omitted. As for what makes an Attic hero, I have included figures either worshipped in Attica, or with strong mythological or genealogical links with the area; Salaminian heroes, who belong in the last analysis to a different tradition (Ajax was a foreigner for Herodotus), I have included only where there are cultic or mythical links with Attica proper. The references and testimonia are intended as a guide only, with preference given to the earlier material available. While I have tried to be reasonably complete in presenting the cult aspect, the treatment of mythology is more selective; it does not seem worthwhile to duplicate the exhaustive collections of material found in Pauly-Wissowa, Roscher, and now the Lexicon Iconographicum. These, as well as less standard works indicated at the appropriate points, may be considered to supplement the mythological details given here, where the emphasis lies on the connexions with Attica. An asterisk is placed before the name of a hero where cult is attested or can be securely inferred; in many other cases cult is likely but not certain. * 'ÀyXavpoç Aglauros (see also Herse, Pandrosos) Place of worship. A. 's sanctuary was in a cave at the east end of the acropolis, G. Dontas, Hesperia 52 (1983) 48-63; cf. Hdt. 8.53.

Paus, seems to suggest that the heroön is not at the point by the Nike Apteros from which Aigeus leapt to his death (see below). Perhaps it was at the Delphinion, which he founded (Bekk. Anecd. 1.255) and where he lived (Plut. Thes. 12.6), or at the sanctuary of Aphrodite Ourania, also founded by him, Paus. 1 .14.7. (See PXch3tt1, fípcoç etcì.) Cult. As an eponymos, A. received special worship from the tribe Aigeis, but no details are known, other than that in the second century his priest was drawn from the tribe (IG II2 952). He was also worshipped as a member of the group: see ēncovuļioi fíptoeç. Mythology. Son of Pandion, brother of Pallas, Nisos and Lykos: apparently in Soph. TGrF 24, cf. ARV2 1268.2, with Aigeus; he is absent from the brothers in ARV2 259.1 (shortly before 480). Later writers follow this version (e.g. Apollod. 3.15.5), but there was also a tradition that the Pallantidai claimed that A. had been the son of Skyrios (Apollod. loc. cit), or merely adopted by Pandion (Plut. Thes. 13.1). Married Meta (Melite, schol. E.

There are no Attic connexions, as far as is known; the appearance of A. in Athens may be due simply to a conjectural identification.

In Athens, Anakeion was the official title of the shrine, but Dem. 19.158 names it Dioskorion, and paintings by Mikon and Polygnotos depicted the Dioskouroi, Paus. 1.18.1. The Attic mythology of Kastor and Polydeukes, most often called Tyndaridai in this context, refers to their invasion of Attica to reclaim their sister Helen (see (c) above), kidnapped by Theseus, Hdt. 9.73, Plut.

Also as one of the eponymoi (q.v.). Cult details. A. was an eponymos, and it is possible that his cult came to Kynosarges only after 508/7. Pausanias does not mention A. in his brief description of the sanctuary, 1.19.3. The priesthood was held by a member of the tribe, Dow, Prytaneis 71(1 69/8). Mythology. The only connection of A. with Attica seems to be his appearance as a boy among those destined for the Minotaur, ABV 76.1; but is this the same A.? [Dem.] 60.31 cannot produce any of his inspiring deeds. He was the son of Herakles ([Dem.] loc. cit, Apollod. 1.8.3) and Meda, daughter of Phylas, Paus. 1.5.2. His son also Phylas, Paus. 2.4.3, al. His descendants led the return of the Herakleidai, Paus. 2.4.3, Apollod. loc. cit, Diod. 4.37, and had connexions with both Corinth and Boeotia. On the possible significance of this, see p. 88 n. 47.

There were several heroes called Glaukos; this is presumably one of the Boeotian figures so called, although Schachter, Cults of Boiotia ( B1CS Supp. 38.1, 1981) 228, points out that there is no evidence of actual cult in Boeotia. Nothing in myth connects him with Attica. See RE VII 1408-13; Schachter loc. cit. *Aóeipa, Aaîpa Daeira, Daira Place of worship. Clearly at Eleusis (see below). Also at Marathon (Tetrapolis calendar B 1 1-12) and at the Eleusinion at Paiania (IG I3 250.15-16). Cult details. A priest ôaeipíxriç, Pollux 1 .35 (presumably at Eleusis). Priestess of Demeter is absent at sacrifices to D., and must abstain from the offerings, Eustath. //. 6.648 (see Tresp 12); also presumably referring to Eleusis. At Marathon she receives a pregnant sheep (fertility) in Gamelion (month of marriages). At Paiania she receives a female lamb. Mythology. D. is much more a goddess than a heroine; Pherecydes (FGrH) 3 F 45 called her sister of Styx, and Aeschylus apparently identified her with Persephone (fr. 277 Nauck2). Aphrodite, Hera and Demeter are other identifications, as also the guardian placed upon Persephone in the underworld. See RE IV 1980-2. Her claim to be a heroine must rest on her place in Eleusinian genealogies: she is mother of the hero Eleusis by Hermes, Paus. 1 .38.7, and still more significantly, wife of Eumolpos and mother of Immaros, Clem. Alex. Protr. 3.45. See G. Sfameni Gasparro, Misteri e culti mistici di Demetra (Rome 1986) 1 1 1-1 14.</page><page sequence="160">1 54 THE HEROES OF ATTICA *AaíôaXoç Daidalos Place of worship.

The Tyndaridai invaded Attica to look for her, and were helped by many local figures (see Dekelos, Hekademos, Marathos, Titakos).

It is unclear whether the Attic hero was identified with any of these. * 'HpaicÀ.fjç Herakles Cult. Divine and heroic cults of Herakles are extremely common throughout Attica. They are listed and discussed in Susan Woodford, 'Cults of Heracles in Attica' ( Studies presented to George M. A. Hanfmann, edd. D. G. Mitten, J. G. Pedley and J. A. Scott (Mainz 1971) 21 1-25); to this list might perhaps be added cult at Thořikos (line 28) where Herakles receives sacrifice together with Alkmene in Elaphebolion, but see below (Herakleidai) for a preferable reading. Note also the general statement that H. had a special connexion with the fourth day of the month. Philochorus FGrH 328 F 85. Mythology (Attic). See H. Dettmer, De Hercule attico, Diss. Bonn (1869) 52-69. Plato, Lysis 205C is an attempt to make H. Attic by birth: see Aixone, heroine. In the more normal tradition, H. came to Athens with Theseus, either on being treated kindly after his madness (E. H F I214ff.) or when he had freed Theseus from the underworld. Plut. The s. 35 (Philochorus?). Theseus made over all his xe|iévr| (land, and later sacred precincts) to him, E. H F 1328-33; all except four, Philoch. FGrH 328 F 18 (see Jacoby ad loc.). He was initiated at Eleusis, E. HF 617, Xen. Hell. 6.3.6, vases in Brammer1 151. For this purpose he was adopted by Pylios, Apollod. 2.5.12, Plut. The s. 33. He was first purified and then initiated. Plut. Thes. 30, Apollod. loc. cit., the lesser Mysteries being instituted for this purpose, Diod. 4.14.3. He was initiated by Eumolpos, Apollod. loc. cit.; by Mousaios, Diod. 4.25; or by Triptolemos, Xen. Hell. 6.3.6. The initiation took place before his descent into the underworld, E. H F 613, (Plat.)

Cult details. The myths of E. form two of the aitia for the aicopa, a rite in which girls sat on swings, supposed to be in her honour, Hyg. Astr. 2.4. The name àÀrjxiç also occurs for the festival, Hsych. s.v., and it was also applied to E. herself (cf. her brother Aletes, Hyg. fab. 122), Hsych. s.v. aicopa, Athen. 14.6 618E, and to a song sung at the festival, Pollux 4.55, cf. Athen, loc. cit. (= Arist. fr. 5 15 Rose). Perhaps wandering and searching formed part of the action. The festival was probably connected with, even part of, the Anthesteria (cf. E. 's half-brother Orestes?), Callim. fr. 178 Pf. 3-4; see Maass, Philologus 77 (1921) 3, Deubner 118-9, and cf. Hyg. fab. 1 30: ut per vindemiam de frugibus ¡cario et Erigonae (cf. Aelian, above) primům delibarent. Like that festival, the myths of E. have both gloomy and vinous aspects. Mythology. Two stories were told about Erigone (corresponding with two cult-places?), both in connexion with the aicopa and having certain points in common. (a) E. daughter of Aigisthos (and Klytaimestra, Etym. M. s.v.aicopa), who brought Orestes to trial at the Areopagos, Marm. Par. A25. On his acquittal she hanged herself, Etym. M. s.v. aicopa, Apollod. Epit. 6.25, al. Or Orestes killed her brother Aletes in Mycenae, and attempted to kill her, but she was saved by Artemis and made her priestess in Attica, Hyg. fab.'22. (Cf. the tragedy Aletes, TGrF II fr. lb). Or Orestes married her, Kinaithon fr. 4 Kinkel, al. (b) E. daughter of Ikarios (q.v.), host of Dionysos; when her father was killed by shepherds to whom he had given wine, she went about searching for him with her dog Maira. On finding his body under a tree she hanged herself and called down curses on the Athenians. Girls began to hang themselves; an oracle was consulted, and the rite of the aicopa instituted. Eratosthenes, Erigone (see E. Maass, Analecta Eratosthenea [Berlin 1883] 59-138; F. Solmsen, TAPA 78 [1947] 252-75), Apollod. 3.14.7, Hyg. Astr. 2.14, fab. 130, al. Sophocles wrote an Erigone , but it is not clear which of the two stories he followed. E. clearly belongs with a widely diffused group of 'hanging' heroines and goddesses, such as Helene Dendritis in Rhodes, Paus. 3.19.9-10, and Artemis Apanchomene at Kaphyai in Arcadia, id. 8.23.6. * "Hchjxoç Hesychos Place of worship.

Eleusinioi , Philochorus FGrH 328 F 112 = Plut. Thes. 29.4-5), or he defeated Kreon in battle (E. Supplices, Hdt. 9.27.3), and the bodies were buried at Eleusis. See pp. 129-130. *©r|oev&gt;ç Theseus Cults. Philochorus FGrH 328 F 18 enumerates four precincts not handed over by Theseus to Herakles (q.v.); that is, these are the Theseus cults he regards as the oldest and most important. Jacoby ad loc., followed by Wycherley, JHS 79 (1959) p. 153 n. 20, identifies these as follows: (a) The town Theseion near the agora, Arist. Ath. Pol. 15.4 (time of Peisistratus), Thuc. 6.61.2, Philochorus FGrH 328 F 1 17, etc.; cf. IG II2 2865, al. Here were placed the hero's bones when brought back from Skyros by Cimon, Plut. Thes. 36.4. It was a place of asylum for slaves and others, ib., cf. Ar. fr. 577 K-A. Here the Theseia were celebrated on 8 Pyanopsion,</page><page sequence="175">APPENDIX 1 169 Plut. loc. cit. Among the noteworthy features of the festival were preliminary sacrifices, a procession (IG II2 956.4) and the consumption of soup using a special kind of bread-roll as a spoon (|i')&lt;JTÍA.r|: Ar. Plut. 627 with the scholia): see Deubner 224-6. (b) The Theseion in Peiraeus; IG II2 2498, where the deme lets out the precinct. (c) By the Long Walls, in the western suburbs, Andoc. 1.45 (though see MacDowell ad loc. contra), IG II2 1035.48 (Roman period). This is somewhat uncertain. (d) The heroön of Th. and Perithoös at Kolonos Hippios, Soph. OC 1590-4, Paus. 1.30.4. Other probable or possible cults are at - (e) Lakiadai, where the Phytalidai purified Theseus and received in return cultic privileges from him, Plut. Thes. 12.1, 23.5. (f) Phaleron, where Thesean connexions seem to be better established than at Peiraeus; the description of Pausanias, 1.1.4, reveals heroes with Thesean connexions (above, pp. 37-40), and the Oschophoria celebrated at Phaleron are linked in myth with the return of Theseus from Crete (as are the Pyanopsia, Plut. Thes. 23.4). The Salaminioi, who are connected both with the Oschophoria and with the heroes of Phaleron, as the inscription shows, sacrifice to Theseus on 6 Pyanopsion (line 92); the place is not specified. Can it have been Phaleron, and somehow connected with the Oschophoria? 7 Pyanopsion is perhaps a more likely date for the festival, Deubner 146, so this could have been a preliminary or private rite. Despite the mythological connexions of Theseus with north-east Attica (Helen, Hekale) there seems as yet to be no trace of a cult there. In general: Th. was especially honoured on the eighth day of the month, Plut. Thes. 36.4. Mythology. The rich and detailed narrative traditions about Theseus are of very varied origin, much being clearly comparatively recent. The most accessible summary of the myths is Plutarch's Life of Theseus. They are analysed in H. Herter, 'Theseus der Jonier', RhM 85 (1936) 177-239, Theseus der Athener', RhM 88 (1939) 289-386, and RE supp. 13.1045-1238. They have also been examined by F.

But in the context this is not sufficient to prove that a cult really existed; see p. 55 n. 55. Mythology. Th. was an Athenian sent by Theseus to be an ally of Herakles; he became eponym of Thrious in Achaia/Elis, Steph. Byz. s.v. ôpioûç. The Athenian origins show the connexion with the Thriasian plain. See p. 96. 0')1íoíxt1ç Thymoites Cult. Unknown. Diodorus the Periegete, FGrH 372 F 28, makes him eponym of the deme Thymaitadai (Thymoitadai), which formed part of the Tetrakomoi. Mythology.

He was the younger bastard brother of Apheidas (q.v.), and deposed and killed him and ruled in his stead, Demon FGrH 327 F 1; or he (Tymoithes) killed Apheidas before his accession, Nic. Damasc.

He refused to fight Xanthios the Boeotian; Melanthos then took him on, Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 23, and reigned instead of Thymoites, Paus. loc. cit. *vIockxoç Iacchos Place of worship. I. was particularly associated with the procession of mystai from Athens to Eleusis (7îp07ué|i7ceiv xòv "laK^ov, IG II2 1006.10, cf. Plut. Phoc. 28). A building in Athens called the Iaccheion was presumably on this route, Plut. Ari st. 21.4 , Alciphron Ep. 3.23.1); this could have been an alternative name for another building, or an otherwise unknown structure. His role in the Mysteries is impossible to define with any certainty, but he appears in close connexion with the Eleusinian goddesses (e.g. Artem. Oneir. 2.39: Arļļnr|Trip Kai Kopiļ Kai ó teyójxevoç "I.: teyójievoç showing identification with another figure?) and Strabo (468) calls him àpxTiyETTiç xòv ļjDOTrļpicav. Paired with the Eumolpidai in Cic. De Leg. 2.14.35. He may also receive cult in Athens at the lesser Eleusinia, if the title àpxîiTEiriç refers to him (Nikomachos calendar line 67); see Oliver, Hesp. 4 (1935) 27. Mythology. As with many Eleusinian figures, it is difficult to say whether Iacchos is hero or god; perhaps the divine features are more prominent. He is generally considered to be in origin the personified shout of the initiates (e.g. Etym. M. s.v. 'IaKxoç; cf. Hdt. 8.65, Ar. Ran. 395-416). Identification may have been almost a matter of personal choice; in the ritual of the Lenaia the name clearly refers to Dionysos, as son of Semeie (schol. Ar. Ran. 479), and he is identified with Dionysos also in S. Ant. 1120, as very commonly in later times. Nursling (child?) of Demeter perhaps there also, and Lucr. 4.1160.

Despite H.'s tribal status, the priesthood was a gentilician one: see Agora XV 132, 261 and above, pp. 84-5. The priest receives the expenses of a peíanos from the Eleusinian treasury in 329/8 (IG II2 1672.290), suggesting a connexion with the Mysteries (cf. ARV2 496.5). Mythology. H. belongs among the Eleusinian heroes; he is mentioned with Eumolpos and Dolichos in Hes. fr.227 M-W, and pictured on a Mission of Triptolemos, ARV2 469.5. But schol. Nic. Alex. 131, making him Demeter's host, is due to a misunderstanding of the text. H. was the son of Poseidon and Alope (q.v.), daugher of Kerkyon, Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 6, Hyg. fab. 187, Paus. 1.39.3. The story of his birth and his mother's death was certainly narrated by Euripides and Choirilos in their tragedies Alope", cf. Ar. Av. 559. (Alope mentioned in Pherecydes FGrH 3 F 147.) Jacoby (IIIB Supp. notes p. 32) uses Istros FGrH 334 F 10, Theseus and Kerkyon's daughter, as evidence of a tradition that Theseus was father of H. H. (Hippothous) was suckled by a mare, Hyg. fab. 187, 252, cf. Brammer3 264 BI (= Watzinger, Gr.

The story of H. and Phaidra (see E. Hipp.) is clearly located in Troizen, and the only Attic connexion is that H. is Theseus' son. For the development of the legend see W. S.

The clothes of women who had died in childbirth were dedicated to her, E. loc. cit. I. is often linked with the cult of the Taurian Artemis or Artemis Tauropolos (see below), but Euripides is precise in separating I. from the cult of Artemis Tauropolos at nearby Halai Araphenides, which he connects with Orestes (q.v.).

As well as the tradition that I. was the daughter of Agamemnon and Klytaimestra (first in Cypria fr. 12 Kinkel, with Proclus, p. 19 K) another version made her daughter of Theseus and Helen, Stesichorus PMG 191, Douris FGrH 76 F 92, al. For the normal version that I. was to be sacrificed at Aulis and that Artemis substituted a deer ( Cypria : Proclus, Kinkel p. 19), versions of more Attic flavour replace Aulis with Brauron (Euphorion fr. 95 van G) and the deer with a bear (cf. the arkteia), Phanodemus FGrH 325 F 14* or a bull (hence Tauropolos), Ant.

Presumably at or near Eleusis; his worship with Metaneira (q.v.) is attested in Athenagoras, npeoßeia Jtepì xpicrciav&amp;v 14, so perhaps he was worshipped in the sanctuary of Metaneira on the road to Megara, Paus. 1 .39.2. See below for his daughters. Also in Athens at the Lesser Eleusinia, Nikomachos calendar line 72. Mythology. Host of Demeter, H. Hymn Dem. passim. Eleusinian chieftain, ib. 153-5,475. Son of Eleusis (?), ib. 105; of Raros, Suda s.v. 'Papiáç. His wife was Metaneira, Hymn and most other sources; Neaira, Marm. Par. A 1 2; his son Demophon, Hymn' or Triptolemos, most later sources. He ordered a temple to be built to Demeter, Hymn 292ff.; began the custom of giving free meals at the prytaneion in Athens, Plut. Mor. 667D. He came to power after Eleusios (q.v.; not his father, therefore) was killed, but was deposed by Eleusios' son Triptolemos, Philochorus FGrH 328 F 104 (Boccaccio). *KeXeoú dvyoaépeç Daughters of Keleos Place of worship. Their tomb was at Eleusis, Clem. Alex. Protr. 3.45.2. Mythology. In the Hymn to Demeter (109-10) they are Kallidike, Kleisidike, Demo and Kallithoe; in Paus. 1.38.3 (quoting Pamphos and, oddly, Homer) Diogeneia, Pammerope and Saisara. They met Demeter by the well Parthenion (= Kallichoron? Richardson, Hymn pp. 326-8) and take her to their father's house, Hymn 98ff. The Mysteries were entrusted to them, Suda s.v. EfyioXjcoç; with Eumolpos they performed the sacred rites, Paus. 1.38.3. *Képa|ioç Ķeramos Place of worship. In the deme Kerameis, Philochorus FGrH 328 F 25 (suggesting cult); Paus. 1.3.1 connects him with the Kerameikos, which is much the same. Mythology. Son of Dionysos and Ariadne, Paus. loc. cit. (? - Kerameus, codd.). Son (Suda s.v. tcepaiieúeiv) or father (schol. Ar. Eccl. 253) of Kephalos (uncertain whether this really refers to the relevant heroes). Kepiaxov Kerkyon Place of worship. Cult not attested; near the tomb of Alope (q.v.) outside Eleusis was the jiáXaioTpa Kepicuóvoç, where K. was defeated by Theseus. Mythology. Son of Poseidon and of the daughter of Amphiktyon, half-brother of Triptolemos, Choirilos fr. 1 Nauck2 (= Paus. 1.14.3). Kerkyon son of Brancho(u)s and Argiope, Apollod. Epit. 1.3 appears not to be Attic; closer to our K. is the Arcadian Kerkyon, son of Agamedes (Charax FGrH 103 F 5) and father of Hippothoös (cf. the Attic Hippothon, grandson of Kerkyon), Paus. 8.53.6; the Kerkyon at Eleusis came from Arcadia, Plut. Thes. 11.1. Father of Alope (q.v.); killed his daughter on the birth of her child. This was the story of the dramas of Choirilos, Euripides and Karkinos. Father of Ekphantos and ancestor of Mousaios, Suda s.v. Movtoaîoç.</page><page sequence="183">APPENDIX I 177 K. challenged passers-by to wrestle with him, and then killed them; Theseus, however, defeated and killed him, Plut. Thes. 11.1, Paus. 1 .39.3; the encounter must be implied in Istros FGrH 334 F 10. * KécpaÀoç Kephalos Place of worship, (a) Thorikos, calendar lines 16-17. (b) Perhaps at the temple of Apollo at Aigaleos, founded by his descendants (Paus. 1 .37.6) ? See pp. 70, 95 n. 85. Cult details. At Thorikos K. receives a ram in Boedromion; his wife Prokris also receives cult, and the hero Thorikos and his heroines may also be part of this sacrifice group. He may also receive a 40-50 dr. ox in Skirophorion; Daux proposes [Ke&lt;pá]À.(oi. Two annual sacrifices would be paralleled in this calendar by Thorikos (q.v.). In general, K.'s cult is old; he appears to be one of the hundred heroes picked by Cleisthenes as potential tribal eponymoi, schol. E. Hipp. 455. Mythology. There were two main traditions regarding K.'s parents: (a) He was the son of Deioneus, Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 22; or Deion, Paus. 1 .37.6, Hyg. fabb. 188, 241, cf. schol. E. Hipp. 455. (b) He was the son of Hermes and an Athenian princess. Son of Hermes, Hyg. fab. 241; of Hermes and Herse (cf. Keryx), Apollod. 3.14.3; of Hermes and Kreousa, Hyg. fab. 270. Other versions: son of Pandion, Hyg. fab. 270. Perhaps son of Kerameus (may not refer to hero), schol. Ar. Eccl. 253. K. as baby, but mother unnamed, in ARV2 1248.8. Inhabitant of Thorikos (cf. cult), Apollod. 2.4.7, Ant. Lib. 41; perhaps of Thorai, Pherecydes FGrH 3 F 34. Eponym of Kephallenia, Arist. fr. 504 Rose, al. Snatched up by Eos or Hemera, Hes. Theog. 985-7, E. Hipp. 454-6, ARV2 1268.2, Paus. 1.3.1 (Stoa Basileios); father of Phaethon by her, Hes. and Paus, locc. citt.; or of Tithonos (himself father of Phaethon), Apollod. 3.14.3. Husband of Prokris (q.v.; cf. sacrifice calendar, above); his testing of her and accidental homicide, Pherecydes FGrH 3 F 34, and presumably Soph. Prokris (but see Radt ad loc.), al. His trial for this was one of the early Areopagos trials, Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 22. After Prokris' death he married Klymene daughter of Minyas; his son by her was Iphiklos, Nostoi fr. 4 Kinkel. Also father of Oie (q.v.), Philochorus FGrH 328 F 28. He was a famous hunter with an unbeatable hound, Epigonoi fr. 2 K. See M.

See pp. 67-8. Mythology. Bastard brother of Krokon (q.v.), Istros FGrH 334 F 14 (cf. the lawsuit of the Krokonidai and Koironidai, Harpocration s.v. Koipovíôou). They were sons of Triptolemos, Bekk. Anecd. 1.273.27. KóXaivoç Kolainos Place of worship. If anywhere, at the temple of Artemis Kolainis at Myrrhinous. Jacoby, FGrH HIB Supp. p. 178 believes that he is an atthidographic invention, but although there were other aetiologies to explain the cult epithet, K. could be a genuine founder-hero and archetypal priest: the cult had a priest, not a priestess, Metagenes fr. 1 Kock. Mythology. In the Myrrhinousian account K. ruled before Kekrops, Paus. 1.31.5. He was a son or descendant of Hermes who founded the sanctuary of Artemis Kolainis in response to an oracle, Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 13 = Phanodemus FGrH 325 F 3. An Attic Kelainos (one letter changed) in Messenia, Paus. 4.34.8; see Toepffer 217. Kotaovóç Kolonos Cult. Unknown, but he is connected with the deme Kolonos Hippios. Mythology. Horseman, àpxHYÓç, and eponymous hero of the deme, Soph. OC 59-61, 65. (Kolonos at Plut. Mor . 300D must belong in Tanagra and be the son of the Boeotian, not the Attic, Kephisos.)

In Thorikos (left side 58); the reading is uncertain, but groups of heroines are common in this calendar. On the analogy of Thorikos, Pylochos and Hyperpedios one might think here of a Koroneus. (Koronos king of Lapiths, //. 2.746.) Cf. also the Koronides of Orchomenos, Ant. Lib. 25: and the Koptovíôeç KÓpai of TGrF 1.208 F 1, with p. 67 n. 15 above. *Kpavaóç Kranaos Place of worship. Lamptrai, where his monument survived in Pausanias' day, 1.31.8. Cult details. The priesthood was in the hand of the genos Charidai, Hsych. s.v. Xapíôai. See p. 66. Mythology. K. was an autochthon; he married Pedias, a Lakedaimonian woman, and his daughters were Kranae, Kranaichme and Atthis (q.v.), Apollod. 3.14.5. His son was Raros (but q.v.), Hsych. s.v. Kpavaoû uíóç. He judged the contest of Athena and Poseidon, (a view rejected in) Apollod. 3.24.1. In his reign Deukalion came to Athens and established the sanctuary of Zeus ?01ympios, Marm. Par. A4. Amphiktyon (q.v.) was his son-in-law, Paus. 1.2.6, but nevertheless deposed him, ib. 1.31.3, Apollod. 3.14.6; whereupon K. fled to Lamptrai, Paus. 1 .3 1 .3. Kpeovaa Kreousa Place of worship.

Daughter of Erechtheus, seduced or raped by Apollo, to whom she bore Ion; later she married Xouthos, E. Ion. But some (earlier?) versions appear to make Ion Xouthos' own son: see under Ion. The context of Kleidemos FGrH 323 F 19 is confused, but it seems clear that K. married Xouthos. Mother of Doros and Achaios by Xouthos, E. Ion 1589-94. Mother of Kephalos by Hermes, Hyg .fab. 160 (but cf. Herse). Kpióç Krios Cult unattested; he is the eponym of the deme Krioa, Polemon fr. 9 Pr. G. Kirchner, Attica et Peloponnesiaca (Diss. Greifswald, 1890) 36-7 wishes to relate K. to Pallas; he is the son of K. and Eurybie at Hes. Theog. 374-5, but the Attic P. is firmly son of Pandion. KpoKwv Krokon Place of worship. In the area beyond the Rheitoi (coming from Athens) was said to be the ßaoiteia Kpoicœvoç, but Pausanias was unable to find the hero's tomb, 1 .38.2. Cult details. With the Krokonidai were associated certain of the preliminary rites of the Mysteries (above, p. 69), but it is not clear that K. himself was honoured in this connexion.</page><page sequence="186">1 80 THE HEROES OF ATTICA Mythology. K. was the legitimate brother of Koiron, Istros FGrH 334 F 15; Triptolemos was their father, Bekk. Anecd. 1.273.27.

See above, pp. 67-8. *Kua|AÍTiiç Kyamites Place of worship. On the Sacred Way, where he had a small temple by the tomb of Theodektes, Paus. 1.37.4, Phot. s.v. K'kx|íítt1ç. The Kva|aîxiç, a bean-market, was nearby, I Plut. I Mor. 837C. See Farnell 89; O. Kern, Die Religion der Griechen I (Berlin 1926) 1 15. But the hero may owe his name simply to the physical proximity of the bean-market. KtiXavfloç Kylanthos Cult unknown. Mythology. Son of Leos; Suda, Phot. s.v. AetoKÓpeiov. Kiivvriç Kynnes Place of worship. If at all, at the Kynneion or temple of Apollo Kynneios: at Halai, ? Crates fr. 2 Tresp (= Phot., Suda s.v. Kúvvrjç). But the myth connects K. with Hymettos and Parnés. Cult details. (The Kynnidai provided the priest of Apollo Kynneios, Hsych. s.v. KvwiSai; this need not involve cult of K.) Mythology. Son of Apollo and a nymph Parnethia (or a nymph of Parnés); he was named from the dogs which found the child exposed on Hymettos. Socrates of Cos fr. 2 Tresp = Phot., Suda loc. cit. *K')Xpeúç Kychreus Place of worship. In Salamis, Plut. Sol. 9, Paus. 1.36.1; he was connected with a hill, Steph. Byz. s.v. Kvxpeíoç náyoç. Perhaps connected with Eleusis; see below. Mythology. Son of Poseidon and Salamis, Apollod. 3. 12.7, Steph. Byz. loc. cit. He reared a snake to ravage the land, which was expelled by Eurylochos and took refuge at Eleusis, Hes. fr. 226 M-W (= Strabo 393); or he was himself called 'snake' because of his cruelty, and suffered the same fate, Steph. Byz. loc. cit.; or he killed a snake which was ravaging the land, and so became king, Apollod. 3.12.7. His daughter Glauke married Telamón, Diod. 4.74, or was the mother of Telamón by Aktaios, Pherecydes FGrH 3 F 60; he left his kingdom to Telamón, Apollod. loc. cit. Later activities. Solon sacrificed to K. and Periphemos in order to win them over for Athens in the war with Megara over Salamis; presumably he was successful: Plut. Sol. 9-10. Appeared as a snake at the battle of Salamis, Paus. 1.36.1; cf. Plut. Thes. 10.3. See pp. 46-7, p. 53 n. 38. *A(xkioç Lakios Place of worship.

On 20 Mounichion, receives a 13 dr. sheep/ram, offered without wine, to be consumed on the spot. Mythology. Unknown. G. Dunst, BCH 88 (1964) 482, suggests that L. is a Sicilian hero (Diod. 4.23.8) brought back by survivors of the Sicilian expedition; see RE 12.2258. But this is not necessary, for the name could equally well be that of an Attic hero. *Aeòç Leos (the herald) Place of worship. Hagnous, Steph. Byz. s.v. Âyvoûç, quoting Solon's axones. Mythology. L. was a herald and native of Hagnous, who betrayed to Theseus the ambush planned by the Pallantidai, Plut. The s. 1 3. From this figure should perhaps be distinguished - *A eox; Leos (the eponymos) Place of worship. Uncertain. Documents of the tribe (which normally stand in the sanctuary of the eponymos) have been found on the acropolis (IG II2 1742), in the agora ( Hesp . 9 (1941) 59-66 no. 8) and at Dafni (IG II2 2818). He was certainly worshipped in the deme Skambonidai, IG I3 244.C4-5. It is not clear whether he was connected with the Leokoreion. See S. Rotroff, Hesperia 47 (1978) 206-7. The priest of the eponymos was a member of Leontis in 212/1, IG II2 847 ( = Dow, Pryt. 36) 51-2. Mythology. This Leos, if separate from the preceding, has no real myths attached to him, only to his daughters: cf. [Dem.] 60.29. But he is son of Orpheus in Bekk. Anecd. 1.277.14, and in addition to the daughters he has a son Kylanthos in Suda, Phot., s.v. AetOKÓpeiov. See pp. 80-9 1 . (*)Aeìo KÓpai Daughters of Leos Place of worship. Presumably the Leokoreion, although this name cannot actually be derived from Aeto KÓpai. The location of this building, oddly neglected by Pausanias, is uncertain, though it was somewhere in the agora. See Wycherley, Agora III 109-13; Thompson's suggestion in Agora XIV 123 and Hesperia 50 (1981) 347-8. Mythology. The daughters' names were Phrasithea or Praxithea, Theope or Theopompe, and Euboule; Suda, Phot. s.v. AetoKÓpeiov, Ael. VH 12.28, Bekk. Anecd. 1.277.14. They gave their lives to save their country, [Dem.] 60.29, Diod. 17.15, al.; and the sources above. Aoucria Lousia Place of worship. Uncertain; Steph. Byz. s.v. Aovaia makes her eponymous heroine of the deme Lousia. Mythology. She was one of the daughters of Hyakinthos (see under Hyakinthides), Apollod. 3.15.8, Hyg. fab. 238. This is a rival identification of these heroines to that adopted by Euripides and Philochorus, who make them daughters of Erechtheus. Whether a single one of</page><page sequence="188">1X2 THE HEROES OF ATTICA these sisters should really be identical with a deme eponym, as Stephanus makes her, is doubtful: see p. 102. *Av)koç Lykos It is not clear how many heroes of this name we are dealing with; cf. the list in RE 13.2393-2403. Cult is attested only for the L. near a city lawcourt (èni Aikxo, Pollux 8.21 ), Ar. Vesp. 387; the location of this is quite uncertain, despite A. L. Boegehold, Hesperia 36 (1967) 1 1 1-20. Different topographical indications supplied in the myths are the Lykeion, Phlya, and the Diakria. Cult details. The L. of the lawcourt was pictured in animal form. Harp. s.v. ôeicáÇwv (Eratosthenes). Mythology. The clearest figure of this name is L. son of Pandion, who at the division of Attica received the Diakria as his portion. Soph. TGrF 4.24; cf. ARV2 259.1. He founded the Lykeion and was the first to call Apollo Aúkeioç, Paus. 1.19.4. (Cf. tomb of his brother Nisos near the Lykeion, ib.) He was banished by Aigeus to Asia, where he became the ancestor of the Lycians, Hdt. 1.173, Paus. loc. cit. With this figure Pausanias (4.20.6-8; quoting a Messenian epigram) identifies a Lykos connected with the Lykomidai of Phlya, author of oracles to the Messenians and related to the Mysteries of Andania. See p. 7 1 and n. 36. The reference oí ARV1 1268.1, showing L. with Ajax, Athena, Menestheus and Melite, is not clear. See pp. 1 15-7. *Maia Maia (heroine?) Place of worship. Porthmos (Sounión?). Receives sacrifice at the Herakleia in Mounichion, together with Kourotrophos, Ioleos, Alkmene, Herakles and three anonymous heroes. Mythology. It is very doubtful whether this figure should be identified with Maia the mother of Hermes; rather, she may be the nurse (ļiaīa) of Herakles, or similar. See Nilsson, AJP 59 (1938) 392; and above, p. 35. *MaKocpia Makaria Place of worship. Af the spring called Makaria in Trikorythos, Paus. 1.32.6, Strabo 377. Cult details. Flowers and garlands cast at her grave, or at the spring, schol. PI. Hipp. Mai. 293, al. Mythology (Attic). Daughter of Herakles (name not attested until late sources) and of Deianeira (Paus. loc. cit.), who after Herakles' death took refuge in Attica along with the rest of his dependents, and in response to an oracle gave herself to be sacrificed in order to save her brothers from Eurystheus; the story, but not the name, in E. Held. 381-607, whence other accounts. The story in Douris ( FGrH 76 F 94) that she put out Herakles' pyre seems to be a Macedonian aetiology.

Thes. 32 (Dikaiarchos). He was depicted on the Stoa Poikile fresco of the battle, Paus. 1.15.3, 32.4; at Marathon his statue was that of a farmer-hero, Philost. loc. cit. (confusion with Echetlos?). See p. 45. * Marathon dead Place of worship. At the battlefield of Marathon, Paus. 1 .32.4. Cult details. The monument was crowned and the heroes received enanismos from the ephebes, IG II2 1006.26,69 (122/1). Cult at an earlier date is suggested by the parallel with the dead of Plataia, Thuc. 3.58.4. See p. 55. *Marathon, anonymous heroes The Tetrapolis calendar contains several heroes known by description rather than by name. The following, all from the Marathon section, cannot be classified further (the paired hero and heroine are typical of this calendar): (a) B 3-4: a hero and probably a heroine receive a pig and a table offering. (b) B 9: in the second decad of Posideon a heroine, probably paired with a more important hero, receives an offering. (c) B 24-5: a hero ev [.] potenzia receives a sheep and a table-offering, and a heroine receives a sheep. (Other Marathonian heroes are listed under their epithets.) MéÔcov Medon Place of worship. Unknown. IG I2 872 from Kephale, [h]iepòv Meôov-nôôv perhaps refers to a phratry shrine: the Apollo Patroös of the Medontidai? See p. 76 and n. 56. Mythology. M. was the eldest son and successor of Kodros, Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 23. He was lame in one foot, and his younger brother Neleus or Neileus therefore challenged his right to rule; but Delphi found for Medon, and Neleus went to Asia (eventually founding Miletos), Paus. 7.2.1, Ael. VH 8.5. MéXavôoç Melanthos Place of worship. Worship of M. is not attested, but he is connected with cults of both Melainai (or Eleutherai, or Oinoe - the variant versions perhaps suggesting that his own worship was not known?) and of Eleusis. Mythology. M. was a Neleid from Pylos, king of Athens, Hdt. 5.65.3. He was the son of Andropompeus and Henioche, being descended from the Neleids of Messenia on his father's side and from Admetos and Alkestis on his mother's.

Or they fought at Oinoe, M. laying down the condition that he should succeed to the kingship, and M. really did see a figure behind Xanthios, the story explaining the worship both of Dionysos Melanaigis (though this cult seems to be located at Eleutherai, Suda s.v. péhav) and of Zeus Apatourios, Conon FGrH 26 F 1.39; cf Euphorion, Supp. Hellenist. 418.25-7.

Cult unattested, but she is the eponymous heroine of the deme Melite, Philochorus FGrH 328 F 27. Mythology. M. is a very common name for heroines and nymphs, and far from all traditions relate to Attica. The Attic M. was daughter of Myrmex (q.v.), Hes. fr. 225 M-W, or of Dios son of Apollo, Musaeus DK II B9, or perhaps of Trikorythos, Serv. Aen. 6.21 (though this passage is corrupt, and even if this emendation is correct we may have here another, Tetrapolitan, Melite). Daughter of Hoples (q.v.) and first wife of Aigeus, schol. E. Med. 673 (Apollod. 3.15.6 has Mīļia). When a girl went to Crete with Theseus as tribute (?), Serv. Aen. 6.21 (milita F, Melite Thilo). Mistress of Herakles, schol. Ar. Ran. 501, therefore presumably mother of another hero. (Cf. shrine of Herakles Alexikakos in this deme.) We do not know whether the juxtaposition of Melite with Lykos, Ajax, Athena and Menestheus in ARV2 1268.1 refers to any myth; the shrine of Ajax's son Eurysakes was also in this deme.

This seems to be a healing shrine: see riAE 1953 pl. 6. Mythology. The votive reliefs, over thirty in number, still have not been published in full, but the names found on them are those of Herakles, Pankrates and Palaimon. A dedication to Herakles Pankrates ( BC H 79 [1955] 220) suggests that P. could be viewed as an aspect of Herakles rather than as an independent hero, but it is not clear whether this was always the case. (Compare Erechtheus and Poseidon.) Miliadis' pl. 5 (1953) suggests at any rate that there were at least two heroes, (Herakles) Pankrates (with attributes of Herakles here) and - *naXai|i(ov Palaimon Place of worship. In Attica, P.'s cult is known only in the same shrine as the above on the banks of the Ilissos: Miliadis riAE 1953 p. 58 pl. 9. (IG II2 1368 is late and idiosyncratic.) Mythology. Unclear. The best-known P. is the deified Melikertes, worshipped at the Isthmos (Paus. 2. 1 . 1 ), but more relevant to the Attic P. may be the occurrence of the name as an epithet of Herakles in Lyc. Alex. 663, and at Koroneia in Boeotia, IG VII 2874. On the sanctuary, see p. 17 n. 47. náAAaç, n&lt;xM.avTÍÔai Pallas, sons of Pallas Cult unknown; in myth he is associated with Paliene (Plut.

The brothers took Attica by force from the Metionids after the death of Pandion, Apollod. 3.15.6. In the division of Attica P. received the area south of the city, the Paralia, Soph. loc. cit = Strabo 392, al.; the Diakria, Steph. Byz. s.v. Aiaicpia, may be a mistake (cf. Lykos). ARV2 259.1 depicts P. with Lykos, Nisos and Orneus; ARV2 1268.2 with Aigeus; and Graef-Langlotz II pl. 30 n. 412 with Lykos. P. was father of giants, Soph. loc. cit; father of Boutes and Klytos, Ov.

The Pandia, although a festival of Zeus (Phot. s.v. návôia), were connected also with Pandion: probably he received preliminary sacrifice as founder, above p. 81. Mythology. Later mythographers distinguish two kings of this name; cf. Kekrops. The first was successor of Erichthonios, Marm. Par. A 11, al.; son of Erichthonios and Praxithea, Apollod. 3.14.6. His wife was Zeuxippe, ib. 8. His son and successor was Erechtheus, Marni. Par. A 15; Boutes, Prokne and Philomele the rest of his children, Apollod. 3.14.8. The second P. was son of Kekrops II, Marni. Par A 17, al.; and of Metiadousa, Apollod. 3.15.5.; Paus. 9.33.1 reverses the order. He was expelled by Metion and went to Megara, where he married the daughter of king Pylas, Apollod. loc. cit., Paus. 1.5.3; his sons were Lykos, Pallas, Nisos and Aigeus, ib. (These are P.'s sons also in (atthidographers) FGrH 329 F 2 and probably also in Soph. TGrF 4.24, but it is not clear whether these authors attributed them to Pandion II.) Of these details much is laboured genealogy; originally there was only one Pandion, and of the above, the older traditions relating to him are fairly obviously his Megarian connexions, his fathering four sons among whom Attica was divided, and two daughters, Prokne and Philomele (the nightingale daughter of P. already in Hes. Op. 566; but cf. the nightingale daughter of Pandareos, Od. 18.518). Pandion and Prokne (q.v.), ARV2 1249.21.

The traditions of the sanctuary may therefore have become unclear: was a hero or heroine being honoured? ri£pí(paç Periphas Cult unknown, but myth suggests connexions with both Apollo and Zeus. Mythology. P. was an autochthonous king of Athens before Kekrops. He was just and pious, being especially devoted to Apollo. His subjects gave him the honours due to Zeus and called him Soter, Epopsios and Meilichios; Zeus in anger wished to destroy him, but was persuaded by Apollo to turn him into an eagle (a bird which became particularly associated with himself) and his wife into a vulture ((prļvrļ).

Entrusted Nausithoös and Phaiax (qq.v.) to the services of Theseus for the journey to Crete, Philochorus FGrH 328 Fill (= Plut. Thes. 17.6). This figure is close to: (ii) Skiron or Skeiron the Megarian; a brigand killed by Theseus, hurled into the sea on the road from Megara, Bacchylides 17.24, al. (see Brommer, Theseus 14-18); but in the Megarian account a just man, son-in-law of Kychreus, father-in-law of Aiakos, Plut.

ARV 2 496.2 is the earliest example with names.</page><page sequence="214">APPENDIX 2: THE TOMB OF OEDIPUS Contemporary, independent traditions placing the tomb at Kolonos and under the Areopagos are clearly not possible; we must make a choice, or reach a compromise solution. Most scholars have taken one of two points of view: that Sophocles is using poetic licence and inventing details, or that the Areopagos version is of later origin (it is attested only in Paus. 1.28.7 and Val. Max. 5.3.3) - both equally unprovable. An attempt to reconcile the two locations was made by Wordsworth (Athens and Attica, ch. 30). According to this view, which is supported by Frazer in his commentary on the Pausanias passage, the Sophoclean Oedipus on leaving the stage must be supposed to make towards the Acropolis area, there to die and to be 'buried' somewhere nearby. The KaxappáKiriç ôôóç is then the cave on the north side of the Areopagos, the 0r1Ge(oç nepíftou xe ^Dvi^ruuaxa to be placed somewhere north of the Acropolis (Paus. 1.18.4), and the evxkóov Ar||ur|Tpoç 7tpoaó'|/ioç ná yoç - to be translated then as 4hill in view of Demeter' - is the Pnyx, looking towards the sanctuary of Demeter Chloe, called e')X^ór' in an inscription of the first century (IG III. 191; this section not transcribed in IG II2 3892). The coincidence is striking; especially persuasive is the case of Demeter Chloe or Euchloos, for whom there is no evidence at Kolonos. (The evidence could in any case only be literary, as the usual identification of Skouzé with this hill is purely conjectural.) But there are difficulties in this view. The duplication of the Eumenides/Semnai at both places is an awkward anomaly - at the play's beginning Oedipus wanders unknowingly into a sanctuary of the Eumenides at Kolonos, while the Areopagos grave is also within the precinct of the Semnai. The 0opÍKioç rceipoç, if that is indeed the correct reading, also presents difficulties; surely this should be identifiable, if it is a feature in central Athens? Furthermore, the mTappaKTiļv ôôòv XoXkoíç ßaftpoioi yrļ0ev eppiÇco^evov ( 1 590- 1 ) is obviously identical with the xotÂJcórcoDç ôôóç of line 57, which the context shows to be at or very near to Kolonos; the scholiast on the former passage refers to Istros for the xo^kow ôôóç as a boundary near Kolonos (FGrH 334 F 17). Despite the seductive likenesses in topography, then, it looks as though we must conclude that Sophocles means us to think of Oedipus' mysterious disappearance and 'burial' as taking place somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kolonos. But the evidence for a connexion of Oedipus with Kolonos independent of Sophocles is not really conclusive. E. Phocn . 1706-7 would, if genuine, establish the connexion, since the play was produced between 41 1 and 409, roughly four years before OC was written and nine years before it was produced: ANT. 7TOI) líç 0£ ïïi)pyoç Aii^íôoç 7îpoaÔ£^eiai: OIA. iepôç Kotaovôç, ôcójjcuv iïïïïioi) ůeov. But there are good reasons for believing these lines to be an interpolation, based on knowledge of Sophocles' play (Fraenkel, Zu den Phoenissen des Euripides (Munich 1963) 97-100; cf. Reeve, GRBS 13 1 1 972 1 467-8). Also post-Sophoclean is the testimony of Androtion ( FGrH 334 F 62), who has Oedipus making supplication at Kolonos, but at the otherwise unknown sanctuary of Demeter and Athena Poliouchos, not the Semnai; this may be independent tradition, or it may be simply a personal 'correction' of Sophocles based on knowledge of the local sanctuaries. Otherwise it is not until Aelius Aristides (46, imèp x&amp;v i£TT(xp(ov, Dindorf 2 p. 230) that we find an unequivocal assertion that Oedipus was buried at Kolonos, and his source was surely Sophocles rather than local tradition. Even the inclusion of Oedipus at the heroön at Kolonos (Paus. 1.30.4) could conceivably have come about because of the fame of Sophocles' play. 208</page><page sequence="215">APPENDIX 2 209 The Areopagos version is not unassailable, either. It is not attested before the first century after Christ, and although Pausanias ( 1 .28.7) demonstrates that there was a story explaining the presence of the bones, it is far from clear that this version was already current in the time of Sophocles. There is nothing inherently implausible in the suggestion of Carl Robert ( Oidipus , Berlin 1915, 42-3) that the Areopagos story originates in the identification with Oedipus of the hero Hesychos, who received a 7tpóťh)(ia at the festival of the Semnai; this identification would itself be influenced by the play, in the close association of Oedipus with the Eumenides (Çu|i(popâç Çùvûtim' ë|if|ç, 46) and the stress on silence in the cult of the latter (àôepKTtoç, á&lt;p(ov(Dç, àÀoycoç to tâç ev&gt;&lt;pá|ioi) atoļja cppovxiôoç íevxeç, 30-3: aitvaxa «ptovcov larjôè ļiiļicuv&amp;v Potļv, 489). We are forced therefore to rely on probabilities, and here one's choice can only be subjective. I am inclined to feel that there is a little too much evidence connecting Oedipus with Kolonos to be explained simply by the influence of Sophocles' play. In particular the oracle cited by the scholiast on OC 57, which speaks of Boeotians coming against Kolonos Hippios (p. 51 n. 33), seems unlikely to have been inspired by the play: it makes no mention of Oedipus, but does supply some evidence for Athenian-Boeotian conflict in the Kolonos area. Any Theban defeat in such conflict could easily have been explained by the intervention of the Theban Oedipus on the side of the Athenians, even if there had been no cult of Oedipus in the area before.</page><page sequence="216">APPENDIX 3: THE TRIBAL PRIESTHOOD OF ERECHTHEUS The prytany decree Ag. XV no. 98 (Erechtheis) shows that the priest of the eponymos was a man of Kekropls. This suggests that the situation in this tribe was similar to that in Kekropis and Hippothontis; one priest served for both public and tribal cults, and he was selected on the old gentilician pattern. (A newly-established tribal priesthood would surely draw its candidates from within the tribe.) But there are complicating features; the cult of (Poseidon) Erechtheus was rather more conspicuous in the state than those of the other two heroes, and the priesthood was held by the prominent family of the Eteoboutadai. Further evidence confuses the picture somewhat. The chief difficulty is the fragmentary fourth-century inscription IG II2 1 146, where although restoration remains problematic (contrast Kirchner's text with that of Sokołowski, LSCG 31) it is clear that the tribe Erechtheis is somehow involved (line 6, [tr1ç (p')A.fjç| xfjç 'EpexOriílôoçl). Thus the priest mentioned in line 3-4 ([xòv .iepea tòv «ei] Axxxovxa) is clearly the priest serving the tribe. This phrase does not, however, imply an annual term of office, and the mention of sortition does not contradict the testimony of [Plut.] Mor. 843F, although this passage has sometimes been adduced as a problem in the identification of the Eteoboutad and the tribal priesthoods. In the literary text, dealing with the life of Lykourgos, we are told that Habron, haxcov ek tov yévovç Ttļv íepcocnjvr|v, surrendered the priesthood to his brother Lykophron. The irregularity of this surrender should not be a stumbling-block in our view of the normal procedure; as for Habron's becoming priest in the first place, the natural meaning of the Greek is 'having received the priesthood by sortition from among the eligible members of the genos'; it does not imply that he obtained it by strict inheritance from his father. Sortition is the most characteristic from of appointment of a gentilician priesthood, although the numbers of those eligible might not be large (see p. 71 n. 37). More intractable is the separation of two recipients of cult in lines 2-3: [ton noaeiÔô&gt;]vi Kai toh 'Epe|x$£Î|. The official title was Poseidon Erechtheus, not Poseidon and Erechtheus; this is confirmed by fifth-century usage (IG I2 580) and made explicit by Euripides (Austin, Nova fragmenta euripidea , Erectheus fr. 65.90ff.: Athena to Praxithea): jtóoei 8è tibi a&amp;i aiļKov è (i (ieoiļi rcóXei xeûÇat KEÀ£'Ko Tiepißo^oioi Xaívoiç, KeicXiíaetai õè xoû tcuavovioç ouvem aepvòç rioaeiôôv ovou' ëjta&gt;vo|iaa|iévoç àotoîç 'Epexôeúç è(i (povaícn poudútoiç. For your husband I bid a sacred precinct be built with stone surrounding-walls in the middle of the city (acropolis), and because of his killer, Erechtheus will be named dread Poseidon by the citizens amidst sacrifice of bulls. Otherwise it is not until the time of Hadrian that we find iepétoç rioceiScovoç Tairió/ou Kai 'Epexôeœç (IG II2 5058). Even in that inscription the Kai may merely separate the two epithets; Pausanias, however, adopts a tradition which clearly regards Poseidon and Erechtheus as separate (1.26.5). But this is very much later; for the classical period IG II2 1 146 is unique. For this reason and that outlined above, Kirchner, followed by Toepffer (AG 125-6) and Schlaifer ( HSCP 51 [1940] 255-6), supposed that the reference was to a separate tribal priesthood, unconnected with the Eteoboutadai. But these conclusions will not stand in the face of the prytany decree mentioned above. 210</page><page sequence="217">APPENDIX 3 211 Instead of two different priests for the tribal and the state cults, what we may perhaps have is two different sacrifice customs and two different pictures of the recipient(s). Although 'Poseidon Erechtheus' features in an apparently private, early to mid fifth century dedication by two men of Erechtheis, it is apparent that the concept of Poseidon Erechtheus is already a difficult one in the 420's. For Euripides, the Poseidon element is simply a name. Figures of this type may represent an early and hence anomalous stage in the hero's development, their titles preserved in cult but enigmatic to the worshippers. The enigma may have led to changes in cults of a slightly different complexion. Loraux has pointed out the double significance of Erechtheus, as both the figure on the Acropolis, the autochthonous ancestor of all Athenians, and the tribal eponym, taking his place in the agora, one among ten ( Enfants , 53-7). This double nature is reflected not in a double priesthood, but in two different styles of cult complex. In the old state cult, there is one recipient, receiving a sacrifice more appropriate perhaps to god than to hero. In the tribal cult, it is much clearer that Erechtheus is a hero with a human past, an early king of Athens. He may perhaps be worshipped, as Pausanias says, in connexion with Poseidon, but he is not identified with Poseidon. Rather he would stand in a typical subordinate relation of hero to god, as among the other eponymoi, Pandion to Zeus. Hence 'Poseidon and Erechtheus' in the tribal cult, a concept which eventually comes to predominate even in the state cult.</page><page sequence="218">LIST OF PLATES I A.
