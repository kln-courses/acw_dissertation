FORSYTH University of Southwestern Louisiana , U.S.A. International Review of Modern Sociology 1997, Vol. 27 (Autumn): No. 2; 59-71 This paper examines the social historical evolution of dogfighting. Several international, national, and local dogfighting trade journals were reviewed. Opposition to dogfighting is framed within the concepts of folk crime and cultural conflict. Discussion of the future of dogfighting is discussed, with emphasis on the animal right 's movement. Introduction This research is a social history of dogfighting. Dogfighting is a phenomenon that has existed for hundreds of years despite continuous, although varying degrees of, opposition from religious reformers, various humanitarian organizations, and more recently legislation and law enforcement. This paper will first describe a dogfight. The authors will then give an historical account of dogfighting before its arrival in America. The analysis will then focus on the history of dogfighting in America. The latter part of this history will essentially focus on Louisiana, which has become the center of dogfighting in America. The last part of this paper will endeavour to locate the sport within a sociological frame. The dogfight is a staged event in which two dogs are placed into a pit, much like a boxing ring, and fight until one opponent either quits or dies, at which time the other is declared the winner. There is a referee and two handlers present in the pit with the dogs and many spectators viewing the event. The fight begins when the referee tells the handlers to pit their dogs ; at which time the dogs are released and attack one another. Once the fight begins the spectators begin placing bets with one another on which dog will win. The dogs continue fighting until one of them makes a turn, which is defined as turning the head and shoulders away from</page><page sequence="2">60 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY his or her opponent, Once the referee calls the turn the handlers then handle their dogs when they are out of holds, which means they are not biting each other, and the dog that made the turn must scratch to his opponent. Scratching is defined as crossing the scratch line, which is drawn in the center of the pit, and attacking ones opponent within a specified amount of time, usually 10 to 30 seconds. If a dog fails to scratch, his opponent is declared the winner. If the scratch is successfully completed the fight continues. From this point on the dogs are only handled when they are out of holds and they are required to scratch in turn. At any time in the fight if a dog fails to scratch in turn he is declared the loser. The American Pit Bull Terrier is the main combatant used in these staged events today and he is seen as the ultimate gladiator within the dogfighting subculture. In order to better fathom the continuance of such a sport it is imperative to view its historical context. It is necessary to examine what gave rise to such a sport, who were the proponents and opponents of the sport, what induced legislative attempts to outlaw the sport, what were the effects of such legislation, and what the current state of the sport is. Methodology The data for this study were obtained in several ways : for information about dogfighting prior to the 20th century and the early part of the 20th century we relied on the research of others. This research was found in either books about baiting sports or historical accounts of dogfighting which appeared in the underground trade journals. Sporting Dog Journal is a national dogfighting journal which reports regent fights that have occurred across the country. Sporting Dog Journal is published every two months and reports, on average, 80 fights taking place across the U.S., over this period of time. The Pit Bull News is published monthly in England. Pit -Pal is a local dogfighting magazine, which gives accounts of fights in Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana. These journals are almost exclusively devoted to the pit bull as a fighting dog. For information about dogfighting after this period we also relied on these trade journals, but the bulk of our data came from field research, using interviews with and observations of people who fight dogs. Some of these individuals had been involved in dogfighting for over 60 years. Interviews were conducted with 3 1 individuals who presently fight and breed pit bulls. All of the participants had been involved in dogfighting for several years. The range in experience of current participants was from 4 years to 5 1 years. Ages of participants ranged from 24 to 83 years of age. Three interviews were also conducted with former breeders and fighters of pit bulls who no longer participate in the sport. One of these former participants dates his experience back to 1933. Interviews ranged from 2 to 414 hours and were conducted at the pre-fight meetings,</page><page sequence="3">ENTERTAINMENT TO OUTRAGE 6 1 at the fights or at the homes of dogfighters. Several informal interviews were also conducted with spectators and the wives of men who participate in dogfighting. Additional data were obtained from interviews with SPCA officials, veterinarians and local sheriffs officer. The research also examined newspaper accounts of dogfighting. The research took place in several parishes of Louisiana and counties in Mississippl. Observations took place at 14 formal dogfights. Both of the authors had relatives who were engaged in dogfighting. Additional respondents were identified through a snowball method. Each respondent was questioned regarding the changes in dogfighting. Additional questions were intended to elicit responses regarding the motivations of dogmen and their confrontations with residents, law enforcement and/or humane society officials, or other dogfighters. Respondents interviewed for this research are an available sample, we interviewed all persons who would allow us and who had the time. All questions were intended to be guides for gleaning information, rather than specific responses. The History of Baiting Sports in Europe Baiting dogs against one another as well as various other animals such as rats, bears, and bulls, has been a common practice for hundreds of years (Ash 1927 ; Atyeo 1979 ; Enquist and Leimar 1990 ; Foran 1994 ; Jones 1988 ' Matz 1984 ; Scott and Fuller 1965 ; Semencic 1984 ; Vesey-Fitzgerald 1948). It appears that most baiting sports arose in order to serve utilitarian functions. Ratting is believed to have arisen as a means to reduce the rat population of the inner cities, before sewer systems were developed. Bull baiting is believed to have arisen from the need to tenderize bull meat so that it could be consumed. In 17th century England, it was illegal to slaughter a bull without first baiting it against a dog. While the baiting spectacles may have arisen to serve vital functions they quickly progressed from utility to sport (Foran 1994 ; Jones 1988 ; Matz 1984). Historically man has encouraged lesser species to tear themselves to shreds for his entertainment. Bull baiting and bear baiting were noted to have been in prominent existence as spectator sports as early as the 14th century, throughout Europe. These bating activities were the precursors of dogfighting which did not rise to prominence until the 18th century (Atyeo 1979). In Europe and especially in England, bear baiting and bull baiting were the most popular and widespread of the baiting sports. The baiting sports at this time were governed by the aristocrats and royalty. Originally they were practiced outdoors and later they took place in large public theatres. King Henry VIII had Bankside Bear Garden built in England in the 1 500s (Atyeo 1979). Queen Elizabeth, who reigned in the 16th century, was said to have immensely enjoyed bear baiting and often used it to entertain ambassadors (Matz 1984).</page><page sequence="4">62 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY Although royalty had control over the baiting sports, determining when and where it would take place, the role of spectator was not confined to members of royalty but rather was inclusive of all ranks of society. Baiting sports were the dominant form of entertainment for all sections of society at this time. Careers of champion bears were followed as closely as the careers of boxers are today (Atyeo 1979). The baiting sports produced a market for dogs, bears, and bulls. Many aristocrats became commercial breeders of animals employed in baiting sports. The economic stake of the upper class in the sport, fostered its continuance, after royalty withdrew its support in the 18th century (Jones 1988). During the 16th and 17th centuries baiting animals against one another for entertainment was completely acceptable. Thus baiting sports enjoyed support from royalty and commoners alike and faced very little opposition, at least not formidable opposition, until the 1 8th century. Although this was a time when Europeans prided themselves on being civilized and humane, this time period can be described as a brutal age when the death penalty was still imposed for numerous offenses, hangings continued to be viewed as spectators sports, and woman were often believed to be witches and burned at the stake as a result (Matz 1984). Viewed in such a historical context it should not be surprising that baiting sports were among the most popular forms of entertainment at this time. The notion of sport as a microcosm of the larger society is widely accepted in the sociology of sport literature ; sport mirrors the values and beliefs of the society as well as the maladies of the society in which it exists (Coakley 1982 ; Eitzen and Sage 1978 ; Lapchick 1984). Dogfighting, although practiced throughout this time period was not as prominent as bull and bear baiting and did not become prevalent until the 18th century (Atyeo 1979). Dogfighting rose to prominence at precisely the time when baiting sports, such as bull and bear baiting, lost their royal patronage and therefore were open to legislative reforms. Historical Opposition to Baiting Sport Throughout the history of baiting sports there has been opposition. One of the earliest opponents, of the baiting sports, was the church in Europe. Their opposition to the sport was not due to moral issues, but to the fact that bear and bull baiting were being practiced on Sundays and therefore people were not attending church. At one point in the 17th century, during the reign of Charles I, the Puritans managed to gain control of Parliament and subsequently order the theatres, where baiting sports were practiced, closed (Matz 1984). True to Puritan ideology, they viewed such pleasure producing events as sinful especially since they served as competition for their Sunday congregation. Although the Puritans managed to keep</page><page sequence="5">ENTERTAINMENT TO OUTRAGE 63 the theaters closed from 1642 through 1656, the baiting sports continued during this time and were not faced with formidable legal opposition until 1835. Another source of opposition came from people affiliated with the theater (Matz 1984). Once again, their opposition sprang from competition with baiting sports, with which they shared the theatres at this time. In view of the royal patronage of the baiting sports, the theater was losing ground to the baiting sports. During Elizabeth's reign, much to the queen's dismay, plays were attracting a large part of theater patronage and competing for the stage with her favourite sport. So she issued an order from the Privay Council in 1591 forbidding plays to be performed on Thursdays because bear-baiting and such pastimes had usually been practiced (Matz 1984 : 31-32). Despite numerous attempts to outlaw baiting sports, they did not become illegal in England until the 19th century. Having lost their royal patronage in the 18th century, the baiting sports managed to continue in legal existence for almost a century with the continued support of the upper class. Baiting sports continued to attract people from the upper class, despite increase lower class participation. The upper class lent legitimacy to the increasingly violent spectacle of the pit (Atyeo 1979). In the early 1800s the upper class turned their attention and support to cockfighting. Lacking the public support of the upper class the baiting sports became open to legislative reform. In 1835 the baiting sports (bull baiting, bear baiting, and dogfighting) became illegal in England (Atyeo 1979 ; Matz 1984 ; Semencic 1984 ; Vesey-Fitzgerald 1948). Dogfighting was driven underground. Dogfighting' s Rise to Prominence Although dogfighting rose to prominence in the 18th century it became even more popular among the lower class in England after it became illegal in the 19th century. This is believed to be partly due to the fact that it could be conducted in relative secrecy unlike the other baiting sports (Atyeo 1979 ; Foran 1994). In the 19th century dogfighting became the domain of the lower class people who were dedicated to its continued survival, despite its illegal status. While the working class were the most adamant proponents of the sport, the upper class and even nobility participated although covertly (Matz 1984). In Europe, the status of baiting sports have undergone dramatic changes. Such changes have been spurred by the ability of people with power to continuously redefine the acceptability of various socially constructed events. The very same people who contributed to such events being defined as socially accepted forms of entertainment later redefined them as offensive. By defining such events as illegal or no longer legitimate they placed the people who continued to engage in them in marginal positions.</page><page sequence="6">64 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY Dogfighting in America Dogfighting was transported to the United States during colonization by people from England and Ireland. Dogfighting was prominent in major east coast cities such as New York and Bòston and the events mainly took place in bars (Matz 1984). The legal status of dogfighting and other pit sports varied from state to state within the United States. Before the 1850s there were no laws pertaining to dogfighting and it was practiced openly in public places. In 1 856 New York passed legislation which outlawed dogfighting. The sport continued despite this new law until 1866 (Matz 1984 ; Semencic 1984). In 1 866 the dogfighting fraternity faced their first formidable opponent in the United States ; Henry Bergh and his version of the Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. At first Bergh's efforts were halted by influential members of the fraternity. In 1 874, Bergh was able to secure passage of an Act which empowered him with search and seizure rights. This increased legal pressure forced the dogfighting fraternity even deeper underground. The dogmen transplanted their sport to suburbs surrounding New York and southern cities such as New Orleans. In 1 879 two dogmen ; Harry Jennings of New York and Tom Thornton of Boston moved to New Orleans with 21 bulldogs (Matz 1984). Paradoxically Bergh's efforts contributed to the spread of dogfighting rather than to its demise. Similar circumstances occurred in 19th century England, when a lucrative market in erotica arose out of the creation of antipornography laws (Little 1995). Before Bergh's efforts dogfighting was confined to metropolitan cities and merely served as entertainment in bars ; after his crusade the sport spread across the country. In 1898 C. Z. Bennett established the United Kennel Club which was exclusively dedicated to the registration of the American Pit Bull Terrier (the exclusive breed used in pit fights) and he also established standardized rules governing dogfighting (Matz 1984 ; Semencic 1984). The more opposition this fraternity faced the more cohesive and dedicated to the continued existence of dogfighting it became (see Coser 1956 on the organizing effects of conflict). The upper class patronage of this sport continued into the 20th century. People with political affluence have contributed to the continuance of this sport. Even in the last decades of the 19th century, dogfighting continued to attract people from all walks of life. To the charging of the respectable Victorians, a dog-fight was one of the main entertainments of the Democratic Convention of 1881 which was attended by 300 fanciers of the sport (Matz 1984, p. 198).</page><page sequence="7">ENTERTAINMENT TO OUTRAGE 65 It is apparent that members of the dogfighting fraternity were refusing to succumb to the pressure of increasing opposition and stigma associated with their sport. Dogmen at the turn of the century were engaged in a conflict that is still ongoing today and which is grounded, at least in part, in status politics (Gusfield 1 963). It was in this context that dogfighting spread across the nation in the attempt to escape legislative penalties. It spread to Southern rural regions and to the west where it remained beyond the reach of Humane authorities of the northern cities for a almost half a century. Dogfighting in the 20th Century During the 20th century dogfighting has been transformed by the continual pressure from animal rights groups (see Lutherer and Simon 1992 and Margavio and Forsyth 1996, for examples of tactics used by animal rights and environmentalists organizations). The effects of this pressure are more severe laws prohibiting dogfighting and greater stigma for the participants. As a result of increased legal sanctions, many marginal participants are leaving the sport. In reaction to these pressures the remaining dogmen have become a more secretive and cohesive group. In 1974 there were an estimated 1,000 illegal dogfights held annually in the United States (Brand 1987 ; Sager 1987). Today, dogfighting continues to spread despite its illegal status and the increasing stigma associated with it. One result of these pressures is there are no longer conventions, only private matches. At conventions there were 6 or 7 matches. At private matches there is usually one match and, in rare cases, up to three matches. At conventions there were up to 300 people and the fights may go on all night into the morning. Law enforcement could catch dogmen at conventions because there were so many people and it was difficult to check all participants. In a private match the owner of the location where the fight takes place can check everyone out before they get there. Today dogmen are a closed society. Dogmen don't like strangers. They assume strangers could be undercover agents. As one dogman put it, "We've got to hide ; they make us hide" (Morning Advocate 1982, p. 8). The investigators have an almost impossible task due to the fact that most of the people who fight dogs know each other and they also know who does not belong. It is extremely difficult to gain admittance to a dogfight. A director of an animal control center in Louisiana comments on the difficulty of enforcement. Dogfighting is taken pretty seriously in this state (Louisiana) but it's hard to prosecute. There was a case a few years ago in Tangipahoa Parish. The jury people.... knew the people who were accused of the dogfighting. And the whole bunch of them got off scot-free. They're hard to prosecute, because generally when you drive in, the people run like hell and turn the</page><page sequence="8">66 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY dogs loose. All you can get are the license plates on their parked cars. But we don't see any organized pit bull fighting in our parish. Because, if there were fights, we'd have busted them (Huggs 1993, p. 20). Dogfighting is an illegal pratice in all fifty states. Laws often vary, in degree of severity, from state to state as well as county to county. Louisiana law calls for a $ 1 ,000 fine and up to 90 days in jail for those convicted of fighting dogs. California law, on the other hand, is one of the toughest in the nation and calls for at least one year in jail and up to a $50,000 fine for anyone convicted of owning, keeping, or training a dog for the purpose of fighting (Semencic 1984). In almost every state, it is merely a misdemeanor to attend a dogfight and fines are often as low as fifty dollars. Louisiana is considered, by both animal humane societies and dogmen to be the center of the dogfighting states in the country. In Southern Louisiana, it is not uncommon to see a whole yard packed full of dog houses each with a Pit Bull chained to it. Estimates reveal there is a fight somewhere in Texas, Louisiana or Mississippi every weekend. Pit-Pal, a local dogfighting magazine, gives accounts of fights in a dozen towns and cities in south Louisiana. This same magazine extends a generous invitation to dogfighters across the country to come to Louisiana, with guarantees that the law will not bother them. Pit-Pal magazine also contains advertisements for Pit Bull Terrier pups sired by dogs who have won fights. Despite its illegality dogfighting has a nationwide following. The $1,000 fine is mere slap oi the wrist ; bets at dogfights are often in the thousands, admission is usually $25, with up to 100 people attending. Individuals have been caught at fights with over $100,000 (Kent 1982a, 1982b). Technically, dogfighting is illegal under Louisiana law banning cruelty to animals. In Louisiana the fighting cock is not considered an animal, consequently it is legal. According to Louisiana law1, attending a dogfight is not illegal. The law is focused on those individuals who cause dogs to fight, promote dogfights, sell tickets to such events, or own or operate any facility where such events are held. Opponents of dogfighting say that cruelty to animal laws have not been applied because the punishment is not worth the time and danger involved in a dogfighting raid. The meager results provide little incentive for law enforcement officers to investigate dogfights. Another reason that laws pertaining to dogfighting are seldom enforced is that it is not viewed as a major crime and it is out of sight of most residents (Davis 1984). In addition, in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi, where most dogfights occur, the TEDs (Turtle Excluder Device) conflict has weaken the position of environmentalist/animal rights groups (Margavio and Forsyth 1996). 1. A copy of the law is available from the author's request.</page><page sequence="9">ENTERTAINMENT TO OUTRAGE 67 Social Change, Culture Conflict and Deviance Dogfighting has long been a significant subcultural beacon for many individuals, but it is influenced by the ever increasing social and legal stances against dogfighting. In spite of its cultural significance participation of the average law abiding citizen in dogfighting is declining. This decline can be viewed as a residue of social change. Of particular interest to theorists of social change are the factors that contribute to certain acts being defined as deviant. Strong attitudes in opposition to dogfighting have emerged from moral entrepreneurs who attempt to influence the views of others. In this case, deviance represents behavior which is in conflict with the interests of the more influential cultural segments of society. There are three situations in which conflict between cultural segments is likely to emerge : when 1) the norms of cultural groups are significantly different and the groups occupy adjacent territories ; 2) the norms of one cultural group are extended to cover the territory of another ; and 3) members of one cultural group migrate to an area occupied by another cultural group (Sellin 1938). Much of the south has changed from an agriculturally based society to one eclipsed by the oil industry, tourism and casino gambling (Forsyth 1996 ; Forsyth and Marckese 1993 ; Gramling, Forsyth, and Mooney 1987 ; Gramling and Freudenburg 1990 ; Smith and Parenton 1938). It brought with it different values and forms of recreation. These do not include dogfighting. The result has been an intrusion on a folkway. As this intrusion continues there will be farther stigma applied to dogfighting by those for whom it has it has no meaning and it will either disappear or be increasingly comprised of those with gambling interests as has cockfighting (Forsyth 1996). These changes in dogfighting are another example of the mirco-level social disruption caused by rapid economic growth (Freudenburg and Gramling 1992 ; Freudenburg and Jones 1991). This behavior which was previously permissible and even acceptable became inappropriate and criminal. Dogfighting is only one example of this cultural strife. Laws regulating fish and wildlife are other examples (Forsyth and Marckese 1993 ; Margavio and Forsyth 1996). Dogfighting falls in a category commonlyi called folk crime by criminologists. These laws have little moral restraint associated with them and although their violation is not generally approved, such crimes are relatively numerous and differentially treated in the legal process (Bankston and Jenkins 1982 ; Rose 1961, 1973). The violation of gambling, traffic, hunting and game laws, and woods burning are examples of folk crimes. Folk crime combines elements of these sundry of causal factors into a unique sensitizing conceptual focus (Ross 1961 ; 1973). Acts are not intrinsically deviant. They are judged in various ways. Moral</page><page sequence="10">68 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY meanings and ensuing labels of undesirable, deviant, or condemned are socially constructed. Ideas of right or wrong come to be defined over time within specific cultural and social conteicts. More meanings arise out of specific historical structures and processes. Prohibition and the criminalization of marijuana are such notable models. Many factors play a role in the construction of moral meanings, but theorists of deviance suggest two which are significant : campaigns of moral entrepreneurs to discredit an activity and a significant differential in the relative power and social status of those who engage in the activity and those who condemn it. It is important to note that definitions of deviance are always plastic (Goode 1997). The Future of Dogfighting The future will offer the dogfighters even more strife. As populations have become increasingly urban and contact with rural areas declines the notion of animal rights has arisen and indeed become in some sense a moral crusade (Sutherland and Nash 1 994). As this ideology continues to unfold and take on new vocabularies, dogmen will find even less support. Indeed, animals have been given a moral status in post-industrial society. Our society is changing the way it views animals. Once seen only as meat, fur beasts of burden, participants in baiting sports or companions, animals now are being redefined as feeling creatures having rights similar to humans (Palmer and Forsyth 1992). How far can this movement go is evident in the rejection of fur as clothing. This movement has expanded these inducements into a rejection of animals as food. Indeed, these ideas have entered into many vocabularies. There are a myriad of reasons for this activity (Palmer and Forsyth 1992) : 1) The expansion of social justice from women and minorities to other "suffering" beings ; 2) The world of the "haves" and the "have nots" are so distant now that social activists have become frustrated and left for new turf ; 3) The greening of America concept that conveys the notion that we are all in this together, this includes animals ; 4) An increasing environmental sensitivity ; 5) The rise of our more nurturing feminine side of society ; and finally the trend of modernization which fosters both the need for extensive la'Vs to protect animals and the urban mentality to preserve them (Palmer and Forsyth 1992). As these factors gain momentum, increasing amounts of criticism of the dogfighter and his rapidly fading culture are sure to follow. It will eventually find its way into the vocabularies of motives of the local law enforcement officials who have acted as a cultural buffer between the dogfighter and the encroaching urbanism. Hopefully this research will encourage more inquiry into the interrelationship of culture, deviance and social change.</page><page sequence="11">ENTERTAINMENT TO OUTRAGE 69 References Ash, Edward C. 1927.
